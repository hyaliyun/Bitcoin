Since 1981 he has been working on a feature film called The Overcoat, based on the short story by Nikolai Gogol of the same name. According to the Washington Post, \\"He is considered by many to be not just the best animator of his era, but the best of all time\\".  Biography  Hedgehog in the Fog (1975), one of the director's most widely known works Yuri Norstein was born to a Jewish family in the village of Andreyevka, Penza Oblast, during his parents' World War II evacuation. He grew up in the Maryina Roshcha suburb of Moscow. After studying at an art school, Norstein initially found work at a furniture factory. Then he finished a two- year animation course and found employment at studio Soyuzmultfilm in 1961. The first film that he participated in as an animator was Who Said \\"Meow\\"? (1962). After working as an animation artist in some fifty films, Norstein got the chance to direct his own. In 1968 he debuted with 25th October, the First Day, sharing directorial credit with Arkadiy Tyurin. The film used the artwork of 1920s-era Soviet artists Nathan Altman and Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin. The next film in which he had a major role was The Battle of Kerzhenets (1971), a co- production with Russian animation director Ivan Ivanov-Vano under whose direction Norstein had earlier worked on 1969's Times of the Year. Throughout the 1970s Norstein continued to work as an animator in many films (a more complete list can be found at IMDb), and also directed several. As the decade progressed his animation style became ever more sophisticated, looking less like flat cut-outs and more like smoothly-moving paintings or sophisticated pencil sketches. His most famous film is Tale of Tales, a non-linear, autobiographical film about growing up in the postwar Soviet world.Maya Balakirsky Katz, Drawing the Iron Curtain: Jews and the Golden Age of Soviet Animation (Rutgers University Press, 2016), chapter 8 Norstein uses a special technique in his animation, involving multiple glass planes to give his animation a three-dimensional look. The camera is placed at the top looking down on a series of glass planes about a meter deep (one every 25‚Äì30 cm). The individual glass planes can move horizontally as well as toward and away from the camera (to give the effect of a character moving closer or further away).Interview with Yuri Norstein at Radio Free Europe For many years he has collaborated with his wife, the artist Francheska Yarbusova, and the cinematographer Aleksandr Zhukovskiy. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Norstein's animations were showered with both state and international awards. Then, in a bitter twist of irony, he was fired from Soyuzmultfilm in 1985 for working too slowly on his latest film, a (presumably) feature-length adaptation of Gogol's Overcoat. By that time he had been working on it with his usual small team of three people for two years and had finished ten minutes. In April 1993, Norstein and three other leading animators (Fyodor Khitruk, Andrey Khrzhanovsky, and Edward Nazarov) founded the Animation School and Studio (SHAR Studio) in Russia. The Russian Cinema Committee is among the share-holders of the studio. To this day, Norstein is still working on The Overcoat ‚Äì his ardent perfectionism has earned him the nickname \\"The Golden Snail\\". The project has met numerous financial troubles and false starts, but Norstein has said that it currently has reliable funding from several sources, both from within and outside of Russia. At least 25 minutes have been completed to date. A couple of short, low-resolution clips have been made available to the public.PBS The Overcoat 1. Retrieved 28 February 2015.PBS The Overcoat 2. Retrieved 28 February 2015. The first 20 minutes of the film have also toured among various exhibits of Norstein's work in Russian museums. The full film is expected to be 65 minutes long. Norstein wrote an essay for a book by Giannalberto Bendazzi about the pinscreen animator Alexander Alexe√Øeff titled Alexe√Øeff: Itinerary of a Master. In 2005, he released a Russian- language book titled Snow on the Grass. Fragments of a Book. Lectures about the Art of Animation, featuring a number of lectures that he gave about the art of animation. That same year, he was invited as \\"guest animator\\" to work on Kihachir≈ç Kawamoto's puppet-animated feature film, The Book of the Dead.Details on The Book of the Dead at the Japanese film festival Nippon Connection On 10 August 2008, the full version of the book Snow on the Grass was released (the \\"incomplete\\" 2005 book was 248 pages).

Unlike road bicycles, the track bike is a fixed-gear bicycle; thus, it has only a single gear ratio and has neither a freewheel nor brakes. Tires are narrow and inflated to high pressure to reduce rolling resistance. History Track bicycle (1893) for four, with the first one acting as pacesetter The first bicycle race is popularly held to have been a 1,200 meter race on the 31 May 1868 at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, Paris. It was won by expatriate Englishman James Moore who rode a wooden bicycle with iron tires. The machine is now on display at the museum in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England. The Union Cycliste Internationale was founded on 14 April 1900 by Belgium, the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland to replace the International Cycling Association, which had been formed in 1892, over a row with Great Britain as well as because of other issues. Frame design A track frame is specific to its intended use, with emphasis on rigidity and lightness. Frames for sprinting seek to maximize rigidity, while those for general racing seek to reduce aerodynamic drag. The dropouts or track ends face rearwards to facilitate chain tension adjustment. A true track fork, unless aerodynamics are the primary consideration, has round-section blades for greater lateral stiffness when sprinting. The crown is sometimes drilled to give the option of mounting a front brake when the bike is used on the road. =Rules= The governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), sets limits on design and dimensions as well as the shape and diameter of the tubes used to construct the frame. The UCI permits special exceptions for the construction and geometry of track bikes. A Keirin bike is a track bike for Keirin races in Japan that meets the strict system of standards of the JKA Foundation (Japan Keirin Autorace Foundation), the governing body for Keirin competitions, still popular under the abbreviation of its predecessor body - NJS (Nihon Jitensha Shink≈çkai or the Japanese Bicycle Association). =Geometry= Bicycle frame measurements A track bicycle frameset differs from one used on the road by having: *higher bottom bracket so the pedals do not touch a steeply banked track *shorter chainstays *steeper seat tube angle for a more aerodynamic position *longer reach *very tight clearances between wheels and frame tubes *modern track frames use spacing for the rear hub *some small-size track frames often have substantial toe overlap with the front wheel that is not an issue for velodrome riding but can make slow-speed turns awkward if the bike is used on the road. =Material= Frames are assembled from tubular elements (typically with round or elliptical cross sections), or cast in a mould for \\"one-piece\\" type models. The most popular materials for frame building include steel, aluminium, or titanium alloys, carbon fiber, or a combination of these materials. Carbon fiber frames are most common at the professional level. Gear ratio Track bicycles have only one drive sprocket (or cog) and one chainring, so the size ratio is relevant. A lower gear ratio allows quicker acceleration or 'jump' but can limit top speed. A larger gear ratio makes sustained speed easier, important in pursuit racing, time trial and bunched races such as points or scratch events. Without a good jump, the rider risks opponents accelerating away; without good sustained speed, the rider will be unable to keep up with a fast race. Track sprinters make a compromise by using particular gear ratios that allows them to reach race speeds at a relatively high cadence (pedalling), around 130-135 rpm (revolutions per minute). Long-distance attempts such as the hour record sometimes use high gear combinations such as 52x12 or 55x14. Ond≈ôej Sosenka used 54x13 with cranks to set the 2005 record. Chain Bicycle chains used in track, fixed gear and single speed cycling come in two common roller widths (the internal width between the inner plates): inch (3.18 mm) and . The chainring, sprocket and chain should all be the same width. Although a wider chain will work on a narrower chainring or sprocket, it is not ideal. A narrower chain will not work on a wider chainring or sprocket. Newer bicycles with derailleur gears use bushingless chains which flex, making gear changing possible. There are also inch bushingless chains on the market, which can be lighter or cheaper. Track bicycles, however, need increased strength rather than a lightness or a flexibility, so most of the track chains still use the full-bushing design. Tires Tubular tires are most often used in track racing and training, though advances in clincher tire design have seen them being used somewhat more often.

Liszt for the book's first edition in 1997). Content The authors define the term slut as \\"a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that sex is nice and pleasure is good for you.\\" The term is reclaimed from its usual use as a pejorative and as a simple label for a promiscuous person. Instead, it is used to signify a person who is accepting of their enjoyment of sex and the pleasure of physical intimacy with others, and chooses to engage and accept these in an ethical and open way‚Äîrather than as cheating. The Ethical Slut discusses how to live an active life with multiple concurrent sexual relationships in a fair and honest way. Discussion topics include how to deal with the practical difficulties and opportunities in finding and keeping partners, maintaining relationships with others, and strategies for personal growth. It contains chapters discussing how consensual non-monogamy is handled in different subcultures such as the gay and lesbian communities, information on handling scheduling, jealousy, communication, conflict in relationships, and etiquette for group sexual encounters. Adaptation An article in the January 31, 2007, issue of the East Bay Express reports that Moses Ma will be producing a movie adaptation of The Ethical Slut. As of 2014, that project had not come to fruition. In 2013, Ben Fritz (producer/director) raised funding privately and via Kickstarter to create an episodic web series inspired by the book with input from Easton and Hardy. By 2016, four seasons of The Ethical Slut were released on YouTube despite struggles for funding after the first season. There are 50 episodes, ranging between 4 and 9 minutes. The series follows two female friends as they decide to explore open relationships with the aid of the helpful handbook, The Ethical Slut. Play adaptation Playwright John Sable's Multiple O, a play adaptation of The Ethical Slut, opened on May 2, 2008, at the Broom Street Theater. Further editions Co-author Dossie Easton reported in May 2007 that Easton and Liszt were working on a second edition of the book, including more communication exercises and information about polyamory communities on the Internet.Easton, Dossie. Interview. \\"Episode 110\\". Polyamory Weekly. By Cunning Minx. May 24, 2007. Quoted in \\"Upcoming Poly Books and Movie\\". Polyamory in the News. May 25, 2007. It was published in March 2009 and is called The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships & Other Adventures. A third edition was released in August 2017 entitled The Ethical Slut, Third Edition: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Freedoms in Sex and Love. The third edition has been revised to include interviews with poly millennials (young people who have grown up without the prejudices their elders encountered regarding gender, orientation, sexuality, and relationships), tributes to poly pioneers, and new sidebars on topics such as asexuality, sex workers, and ways polys can connect and thrive. The authors also include new content addressing nontraditional relationships beyond the polyamorous paradigm of \\"more than two\\": couples who don't live together, couples who don't have sex with each other, nonparallel arrangements, couples with widely divergent sex styles, power disparities, and cross-orientation relationships, while utilizing non-binary gender language and new terms that have come into common usage since the last edition.

History Inami is most well known for its extensive wood carving district which traces its origins to the construction of the Inami Betsuin Zuisen-ji Temple in 1390. This temple, entirely made of wood and ornamented with intricate carvings has a long history of burning down only to be rebuilt in a much more extravagant fashion. The temple was most recently rebuilt during the Meiji period in 1885, and now exists as the largest wooden Pureland Buddhist temple in the Hokuriku region. It was officially designated as \\"one of the prefecture's important cultural assets\\" on April 1, 1965. Because of its rich history, wood carving is the major trade in Inami. During the reconstruction of the temple in the mid 18th century woodcarvers from Kyoto were dispatched to help in the rebuilding process. These helpers ushered in a new era of woodcarving in Inami, and local carpenters began to produce a more varied assortment of carvings than the temple pieces they had focused on previously. Presently, the woodcarvers use over 200 different variations of chisels to complete their works. They are considered to be the most skilled woodcarvers Japan. The sound of the Inami woodcarving district was chosen in 1996 as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan.

In the Middle Ages, French kings expelled most of the original Ashkenazi Jewish population to Germany. Since the French Revolution (and Emancipation), Jews have been able to contribute to all aspects of French culture and society. Moreover, the Cremieux decree gave in 1870 the full French citizenship to North-African Jews, living in the Maghreb under French colonization. During World War II, a significant number of Jews living in Metropolitan France perished in the Holocaust, deported to Nazi death camps by the French Vichy government. After 1945, France served as a haven for Askhenazi refugees, then after the independence of Morocco, Tunisia and the end of Algerian War, an influx of immigration of Sephardi Jews saw the Jewish population triple to around 600,000, making it the largest Jewish community in Western Europe. Behind the United States and Israel, France ranks 3rd by Jewish population. In 2019, the Jewish Agency evaluated the Jewish population in France to be 450,000, not mentioning French citizens with only one Jewish parent or grandparent. The following is a list of some prominent Jews and people of Jewish origins,As a particular counter-example, current French President Nicolas Sarkozy had a Jewish grandfather, is officially Catholic and is not part of this list. among others (not all of them practice, or practiced, the Jewish religion) who were born in, or are very strongly associated with, France.

The lake runs approximately north-south, is 23 miles (37 km) long, up to 1.5 miles (2.5 km) wide, and the full reservoir elevation is 1,604 feet above sea level (489 m). The U.S. portion of Ross Lake is in the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. North Cascades National Park is adjacent to the west and south, while the Pasayten Wilderness is east of the lake. In British Columbia the lake is a part of Skagit Valley Provincial Park, and Manning Provincial Park is nearby to the east. Hydrology Ross Lake from Desolation Peak in 2017 Ross Lake is formed by the impoundment of the Skagit River by Ross Dam, which is operated by Seattle City Light for hydroelectric power generation serving Seattle, Washington, and surrounding areas. After leaving Ross Lake, the Skagit River flows through two more reservoirs before running to Puget Sound. Looking north up Ross Lake, with Hozomeen Mountain in the left- background and Desolation Peak in the center-background High peaks surround Ross Lake in all directions, and include Hozomeen Mountain, Ruby Mountain, Desolation Peak, and Jack Mountain, the summit of which is over 7,000 feet above the elevation of the lake. Rivers and creeks flowing into Ross Lake include the upper Skagit River, Hozomeen Creek, Silver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, Arctic Creek, Lightning Creek, Devils Creek, Big Beaver Creek, and Ruby Creek. Most of these creeks originate from glaciers and snowfields high in the North Cascades. History Ross Dam, forming Ross Lake Ross Dam, originally called Ruby Dam, was built in three stages between 1937 and 1949, and currently stands 540 feet (160 m) tall. A fourth stage of construction was planned for the dam; however, in 1984 Seattle City Light made an electricity- purchasing agreement with British Columbia which delayed any further expansion of the Ross Lake Dam for 80 years. The lake and dam are named after James D. Ross, the superintendent of the Seattle City Light‚Äôs Skagit River Hydroelectric Project, which built the dam. Recreation Ross Lake is a major recreation destination within the North Cascades, attracting visitors with a multitude of fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and hiking opportunities. The trout fishing, in particular, is well-renowned. Ross Lake is not home to anadromous fish such as salmon or steelhead trout as natural barriers in the river prevented these fish from traveling upstream on the Skagit River any further than a few miles past the Gorge Powerhouse. Camping is allowed at a number of boat-in and hike-in campsites around the lake. Backcountry camping permits (free, first-come, first-served) are required, and may be obtained from the National Park Service in Marblemount. The lake is also home to a floating resort called the Ross Lake Resort. Made up of several dozen cabins and bunkhouses, it is situated approximately a quarter mile from the dam and rests entirely on log booms. During the winter, when lake levels shrink, the resort detaches from its shore moorings and relocates to the center of the lake. This is due to lower water levels caused by annual drawdowns of the lake for flood control of the Skagit River. A road from the Canadian side of the lake ends just inside the US. Travelers do not have to report to an official Port of Entry (as required at the nearby Pacific Crest Trail crossing), as they must reenter Canada to leave.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 20,066 and a density of 79.29 persons per km2. The total area was 253.07 km2. History The three-volume History of Muramatsu Town (ÊùëÊùæÁî∫Âè≤Ôºâpublished in 1983 gives many details about its long history. One of only a few castle-towns in Niigata Prefecture, the Muramatsu Clan was ruled by the Hori Family throughout the Edo period. The feudal castle was burned down during the Boshin War in 1868. The site is now a public park housing a small museum archive as well as the town's elaborate festival wagon, which is brought out each September during the Autumn Equinox. In September 1945, 1800 members of the 1st and 2nd battalion, 27th regiment of US Army soldiers were housed at the Signal Corps barracks on the eastern edge of town. They stayed until that December, leaving a very positive impression on the Japanese citizens and contradicting rumors and suspicions spread by wartime propaganda. An English-language memoir of this period was published electronically in 2000 by the University of Kansas Center for East Asian Studies (Goto, 2000). In May, 1946, a very large fire burned for more than eight hours, destroying 70% of the town (over 1000 homes), injuring fifty-nine and killing two. Much of the downtown district was destroyed and historical buildings lost (History v. II, pp. 802‚Äì806). Education Muramatsu had five elementary schools (Muramatsu, Muramatsu Higashi, Kawachi, Juuzen, and Okambara), two middle schools (Atago and Sanno), and a prefectural high school. Transportation =Railway= In October 1923, the Kanbara Tetsudou (:ja:Ëí≤ÂéüÈâÑÈÅì) established a railway in Muramatsu, including a new station and service north to Gosen City. The line then expanded south to Kamo City. The railway company was dissolved in 1999 and all train service in town suspended. The original wooden railway station was purchased and moved off-site to Yasuda City, where it was rebuilt as a small museum. =Highway= * Japan National Route 290 References *Goto, Y. (2000).

The area is famous for onsen near Yahiko mountain. Farming remains the predominant industry in the area. It is served by National Route 116 and Niigata Route 55. On April 1, 2007, Iwamuro became part of Nishikan-ku ward (Ë•øËí≤Âå∫, Nishikan-ku?) of Niigata city. History Iwamuro, which means 'stone' and 'room' in kanji, lies at the foot of . It was originally surrounded by lagoons and marshes before major irrigation work was undertaken in the late 19th and early 20th century. Nevertheless, people have been coming to the area since the Edo period to bathe in naturally-created geothermal waters. Currently there are more than 20 onsens which range in price from cheap (500 yen) to expensive (+20,000 yen). Iwamuro's fame stems from its waters 'perceived' healing properties. An apocryphal tale tells of a farmer's wife who found a goose with a broken leg. She put it in a hot sulphur-smelling pool near her home. The goose's leg got better. The farmer and his wife then became very rich by opening the first onsen in Iwamuro. Behind Yahiko mountain lies the fishing village of . During the Meiji period copper mining flourished in the foothills north west of Maze. At its peak, 60 tons of copper were being extracted each month. Output decreased in the 1920s but in 1943, mining was temporarily revived. Work ended at the end of the war. During the period of the Tokugawa shogunate, Maze was one of the ferry points to the banishment island of Sado. A small watch tower was sited just of north of the village. Samurai were tasked with guarding the shore and questioning all who landed from boats. South of the harbour is Maze Beach, which is popular with surfers. North of the village is the Nihonkai Maze Circuit which holds regular weekend meetings throughout the summer months, attracting sports car drivers from across Japan. Geography The sulphurous waters in Iwamuro rise from depths of up to . They have an average surface temperature of 24.3 ¬∞C and are highly saturated in mineral salts. Iwamuro lies on a fault zone between Yahiko mountain and the bedrock beneath the Niigata Plain. In 2006, due to the number of onsens in the area, additional bore holes were drilled to a depth of . Rice farming is predominant throughout the area although there are several dairy and pig- rearing farms. As the village is on the Niigata plain, the rich soil deposited by the Shinano and Agano River make it ideal for agriculture. Demographics As of 2005, the village had an estimated population of 9,917 and a density of 274.63 persons per km¬≤. Its total area was 36.11 km¬≤. On March 21, 2005, Iwamuro, along with the cities of Niitsu, Shirone and Toyosaka, the towns of Kameda, Kosudo and Yokogoshi (all from Nakakanbara District), the town of Nishikawa, and the villages of Ajikata, Katahigashi, Nakanokuchi and Tsukigata (all from Nishikanbara District), was merged into the expanded city of Niigata. Since Iwamuro became part of there have been several changes in the area. For instance local government services have moved to Maki, Iwamuro's farming cooperative opened a new rice storage centre centralising grain collection for the entire area In April 2008 after closing six independent silos and the fishing cooperatives of Maze and Niigata city have both merged, although the fish market and boat repair yard both remain open. Iwamuro also has two independent sake makers both located in the heart of the old district at Iwamuro-onsen. Products are sold locally and are of a higher quality than commercially-made rice wine.

With a length of up to , it is the largest species of triggerfish in its range (the stone triggerfish, Pseudobalistes naufragium, from the east Pacific is larger). Behavior Titan triggerfish with orange-lined triggerfish and moorish idols at the reef of Fihalhohi, Maldives. The titan triggerfish is diurnal and solitary. It feeds on sea urchins, molluscs, crustaceans, tube worms and coral. It often feeds by turning over rocks, stirring up sand and biting off pieces of branching coral. This is why other smaller fish species are often seen around it, as they feed on the detritus and smaller organisms that are stirred up. Titan triggerfish have been observed being aggressive to other fish who enter their territory. Interaction with humans The titan triggerfish is usually wary of divers and snorkelers, but during the reproduction season the female guards its nest, which is placed in a flat sandy area, vigorously against any intruders. The territory around the nest is roughly cone-shaped and divers who accidentally enter it may be attacked. Divers should swim horizontally away from the nest rather than upwards which would only take them further into the territory.Randall, J. E. (2005). Reef and Shore Fishes of the South Pacific. University of Hawi'i Press. Millington, J. T., & J. E. Randall (1990). Triggerfish bite ‚Äì a little-known marine hazard. J.

Coral Reef Fishes. 2nd edition. Princeton University Press. Debelius, H. (1993). Indian Ocean Tropical Fish Guide. Aquaprint Verlags GmbH. The threat posture includes the triggerfish facing the intruder while holding its first dorsal spine erect. It may also roll onto its side, allowing it a better look at the intruder it perceives as threatening its nest. The titan triggerfish will not always bite, but can swim at snorkellers and divers escorting them out of their territory. The flesh of the titan triggerfish is sometimes ciguatoxic.

Biography Petrov was born in the village of Prechistoye (Yaroslavl Oblast) and lives in Yaroslavl. He studied art at VGIK (state institute of cinema and TV). He was a disciple of Yuriy Norshteyn at the Advanced School for screenwriters and directors (Moscow). After making his first films in Russia, in Canada he adapted the novel The Old Man and the Sea, resulting in a 20-minute animated short ‚Äî the first large-format animated film ever made. Technically impressive, the film is made entirely in pastel oil paintings on glass, a technique mastered by only a handful of animators in the world. By using his fingertips instead of a paintbrush on different glass sheets positioned on multiple levels, each covered with slow-drying oil paints, he was able to add depth to his paintings. After photographing each frame painted on the glass sheets, which was four times larger than the usual A4-sized canvas, he had to slightly modify the painting for the next frame and so on. It took Aleksandr Petrov over two years, from March 1997 through April 1999, to paint each of the 29,000+ frames. For the shooting of the frames a special adapted motion-control camera system was built, probably the most precise computerized animation stand ever made. On this an IMAX camera was mounted, and a video-assist camera was then attached to the IMAX camera. The film was highly acclaimed, receiving the Academy Award for Animated Short Film and Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival. After this, Aleksandr Petrov has maintained a close relationship with Pascal Blais Studio in Canada, which helped fund The Old Man and the Sea, where he works on commercials. He returned to Yaroslavl in Russia to work on his latest film, My Love, which was finished in spring 2006 after three years' work and had its premiere at the Hiroshima International Animation Festival on 27 August, where it won the Audience Prize and the Special International Jury Prize. On 17 March 2007, My Love was theatrically released at the Cinema Angelika in Shibuya, (Japan) by Studio Ghibli, as the first release of the \\"Ghibli Museum Library\\" (theatrical and DVD releases of Western animated films in Japan).http://www.fpsmagazine.com/blog/2007/01/ghibli-brings-west-to-japan.php In a 2009 interview, Petrov stated that he was jobless and using-up the last of his previously earned money.http://niffiwan.livejournal.com/18934.html A 2010 article stated that Petrov wants to create an animated feature film with his technique, but cannot start because of lack of funds.http://animator.ru/articles/article.phtml?id=374 In 2014, Petrov directed a three-minute animated sequence for the Sochi paralympic games called Firebird (–ñ–∞—Ä-–ø—Ç–∏—Ü–∞). In an interview later that year, Petrov confirmed that if he can find the funding, he would like to work on a feature film in the future using his signature style, and stated that he is currently working on a film project but that it is progressing with great difficulty.http://www.rg.ru/2014/06/11/reg-cfo/petrov.html In July 2016 Petrov sat on the board of directors for the International Film Festival of Poetic Animation held in Pergola, Italy. Artistic style Petrov's style from the late 1980s onward can be characterized as a type of Romantic realism. People, animals and landscapes are painted and animated in a very realistic fashion, but there are many sections in his films where Petrov attempts to depict a character's inner thoughts and dreams.

It went into operation in 1968 and was extended in 1977. HVDC Vancouver Island consists of three overhead line sections with a total length of 42 kilometres and two submarine cable sections with a length of 33 kilometres. Route After its departure from Arnott Substation the overhead power line on the mainland splits at into two branches, one running to a terminal at and the other running to a terminal at , where the first submarine cable section begins. At , the first submarine cable section ends and a short overhead line section running south-west across Galiano Island starts. The overhead line leaves Galiano Island south of Montague Harbour in an 880-metre-long span, which starts at and ends on Parker Island at . A little to the west, on Parker Island at the overhead line ends and the second submarine cable section begins. At the cable reaches Salt Spring Island and the third overhead line section starts. It crosses Salt Spring Island west- south-westerly. North of Maxwell Point at and Arbutus Point at the overhead line crosses Sansum Narrows, the strait between Salt Spring Island and Vancouver Island, by a 1900-metre-long span. After this span the overhead line runs westward to Vancouver Island Terminal near the town of Duncan. History In 1968 the first pole of the HVDC Vancouver Island link went into service. Its static inverters use mercury vapour rectifiers. Each of these rectifiers is 3.35 metres (11 ft) long, 1.22 metres (4 ft) wide and 6.10 metres (20 ft) high and has a weight of 4.5 metric tons. The valves are situated in a hall 26.21 metres (86 ft) long, 11.89 metres (39 ft) wide and 11.28 metres (37 ft) high. The maximum transmission capacity of this pole is 312 megawatts and the transmission voltage is 260 kV. The stations Vancouver Island Terminal and Arnott Substation were designed and delivered by Swedish company ASEA (later ABB). The Swedish team of some 10 people were headed for the first phase by Ivan Hedlund and for the second phase by Gunnar Ahgren. In 1977 the HVDC Vancouver Island link was supplemented by installing a second pole. This pole uses thyristor valves for its static inverters and operates at a voltage of 280 kV with a rating of 370 megawatts. A new 230 kV. submarine cable for three-phase alternating current has been constructed between the Canadian mainland and Vancouver Island. This parallels the existing two HVDC lines and replaces one of two earlier 138 kV lines. The HVDC systems are at the end of their service life and are not considered to be reliable. As a result of this, the first pole was shut down in 2016. Electrodes and metallic return HVDC Vancouver Island uses metallic return, during monopolar operation, when current is lower than 600 A. Otherwise earth return is used. On Vancouver Island the line for metallic return is a monopolar line on wooden poles, which are used in some sections also by AC lines, running parallel to the main line of HVDC Vancouver Island. On the mainland, it uses the poles of the electrode line until a point at . After this point it runs on wooden poles together with a single-circuit three-phase AC line until . From there it runs as underground cable to Splasdown Park, where it transits at again into an overhead line, which ends at the terminal of the main line at . The electrode on the Canadian Mainland is a land electrode situated at Boundary Bay at . It is connected with Arnott Substation by an overhead pole line with two conductors. The electrode on Vancouver Island is a shore electrode in a bay at Sansum Narrows at . It is connected with Vancouver Island Terminal by an overhead line with two conductors, which is installed on wooden poles. It runs between Vancouver Island Terminal and a point northwest of Maple Bay at parallel to other power lines.

The line capacity is 3,100 megawatts, which is enough to serve two to three million Los Angeles households and represents almost half of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) electrical system's peak capacity. The intertie originates near the Columbia River at the Celilo Converter Station of Bonneville Power Administration's grid outside The Dalles, Oregon and is connected to the Sylmar Converter Station north of Los Angeles, which is owned by five utility companies and managed by LADWP. The Intertie can transmit power in either direction, but power flows mostly from north to south. The section of the line in Oregon is owned and operated by Bonneville Power Administration, while the line in Nevada and California is owned and operated by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The transition is at the Oregon‚ÄìNevada border, at . This is one of two HVDC lines serving Los Angeles; the other is Path 27.  Overview  The idea of sending hydroelectric power to Southern California had been proposed as early as the 1930s, but was opposed and scrapped. By 1961, US president John F. Kennedy authorized a large public works project, using new high voltage direct current technology from Sweden. The project was undertaken as a close collaboration between General Electric of the US and ASEA of Sweden. Private California power companies had opposed the project but their technical objections were rebutted by Uno Lamm of ASEA at an IEEE meeting in New York in 1963. When completed in 1970 the combined AC and DC transmission system was estimated to save consumers in Los Angeles approximately US$600,000 per day by use of cheaper electric power from dams on the Columbia River. One advantage of direct current over AC is that DC current penetrates the entire conductor as opposed to AC current which only penetrates to the skin depth. For the same conductor size the effective resistance is greater with AC than DC, hence more power is lost as heat. In general the total costs for HVDC are less than an AC line if the line length is over 500‚Äì600 miles, and with advances in conversion technology this distance has been reduced considerably. A DC line is also ideal for connecting two AC systems that are not synchronized with each another. HVDC lines can help stabilize a power grid against cascading blackouts, since power flow through the line is controllable. The Pacific Intertie takes advantage of differing power demand patterns between the northwestern and southwestern US. During winter, the northern region operates electrical heating devices while the southern portion uses relatively little electricity. In summer, the north uses little electricity while the south reaches peak demand due to air conditioning usage. Any time the Intertie demand lessens, the excess is distributed elsewhere on the western power grid (states west of the Great Plains, including Colorado and New Mexico).

The first few towers are self- supported. The towers on the far side use guy-wires. Components The Pacific Intertie consists of: * The Celilo Converter Station which converts three phase 60 Hz AC at 230 to 500 kV to ¬±500 kV DC (1000 kV pole-to-pole) at . ** The grounding system at Celilo consists of 1,067 cast iron anodes buried in a trench of petroleum coke, which behaves as an electrode, arranged in a ring of circumference at Rice Flats (near Rice, Oregon), which is SSE of Celilo. It is connected to the converter station by two aerial ACSR (aluminum conductor, steel reinforced) conductors, which end at a \\"dead-end\\" tower situated at . * A overhead transmission line consisting of two steel-cored ACSR conductors, each in diameter with a conducting cross-sectional area of , carrying 500 kV. ** The two lines when combined have a capacity of 3.1 gigawatts (in bipolar mode). * The Sylmar Converter Station () which converts DC to 230 kV AC (a process also called inverting) and is phase-synchronized with the L.A. power grid. ** The Sylmar grounding system is a line of 24 silicon-iron alloy electrodes submerged in the Pacific Ocean at Will Rogers State Beach suspended in concrete enclosures about above the ocean floor. The grounding array, which is from the converter station and is connected by a pair of ACSR conductors, which are in the sections north of Kenter Canyon Terminal Tower at installed instead of the ground conductors on the pylons. It runs from Kenter Canyon Terminal Tower, via DWP Receiving Station U (Tarzana; a former switching station), Receiving Station J (Northridge) and Rinaldi Receiving Station (also a former switching station) to Sylmar Converter Station. On the section between Receiving Stations J and Rinaldi, one of the two shielding conductors on each of two parallel-running 230 kV transmission lines is used as electrode line conductor. History Sylmar East station, rededicated as the Sylmar Converter Station in 2005 following the upgrade to 3,100 MW. The first phase of the scheme, completed in May 1970, used only mercury-arc valves in the converters.Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGR√â Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987, pp57-62. The valves were series connected in three six-pulse valve bridges for each pole. The blocking voltage of the valves was 133 kV with a maximum current of 1,800 amperes, for a transmission rating of 1,440 MW with a symmetrical voltage of 400 kV with respect to earth. Each converter station housed six mercury arc valves groups, consisting each of seven valves, for a total of 42 valves in each converter. The valves had a width of , a height of and a length of and weighed . Each valve contained mercury, with a weight of . * 1972: After the Sylmar earthquake, the Sylmar Converter Station had to be reconstructed due to extensive damage. * 1982: The power rating of the mercury arc valve rectifiers was raised by various improvements to 1,600 MW. * 1984: The transmission voltage was pushed to 500 kV and the transmission power was increased to 2,000 MW by adding one six- pulse thyristor valve group rated at 100 kV to each pole. * 1989: A further increase of the transmission power to 3,100 MW took place by installing a 1,100 MW parallel connected thyristor converter in Celilo and Sylmar. This upgrade was called the Pacific Intertie Expansion. * 1993: One pole of the Pacific Intertie Expansion converter station at Sylmar was completely destroyed by fire.\\"Fire aspects of HVDC thyristor valves and valve halls\\", CIGR√â Technical Brochure No. 136, February 1999. The converter was replaced in 1994-1995 by Siemens.Christl, N., Faehnrich, W., Lips, P., Rasmussen, F., Sadek, K., \\"Thyristor Valve Replacement Of The Pacific Intertie Expansion Sylmar East 500 Kv HVDC Converter Station\\", IEEE Sixth International Conference on AC and DC Power Transmission (Conf.

It is inspired by the Statice database originally developed at Symbolics. ObjectStore is innovative in its use of the C++ language to make database access transparent. Objects can be created in a database by overloading the operator new(). In this way, one can create new C++ objects directly in the database yet these persistent objects look and behave just like normal C++ objects. Data is mapped into memory as operating system pages. When data is referenced in a different page, by making use of signals, ObjectStore traps the pointer exception and transparently brings objects in from the database by bringing in the required page(s). In addition, by use of a technique called swizzling, the database can be accessed from different platforms, with pages being 'swizzled' as they are brought into memory on page faults to correct big endian versus little endian platform issues as well as virtual function table layout. The design of ObjectStore is described in a 1991 paper in the Communications of the ACM. ObjectStore was originally created in 1988 by Object Design, Incorporated, which was based in Burlington, Massachusetts and founded by several former Symbolics employees, including Daniel Weinreb. In 2002 the product was acquired by Progress Software, which continued to develop the technology, expanding its use beyond the object database market to target uses as a database for real-time computing, specifically designed for RFID data management, and as a cache for relational databases. In 2013, Progress Software sold off many of its non-core products to Aurea Software, Inc., a newly formed operating subsidiary of ESW Capital, the investment arm of Trilogy Enterprises. As part of the deal the ObjectStore product line moved to a separate operating subsidiary of ESW Capital. The ObjectStore product is used in many fields, including telecommunications, financial services, travel, GIS, and the government. One of the early successful applications of the product was with Telstra to handle 13 and 1300 numbers in Australia - similar to 1800 numbers in the US. The product enabled the real time mapping of those numbers to a number closest to the caller - for example a local taxi company or the nearest open Pizza Hut.

Locals pronounce the first word of the river's name in a French-style with two syllables, as in ‚ÄúFork√©d‚Äù (). The Forked Deer consists of various streams designated \\"Forked Deer\\" and their tributaries. Much of the Forked Deer drainage basin was initially wetlands; however much of this area has been drained and most Forked Deer tributaries have been channelized for agricultural purposes. In the mid-20th century much of this was done under the auspices of the Obion-Forked Deer Basin Authority, a Tennessee state agency. Environmental concerns have led to the cessation of channelization on a widespread basis; the federal government's \\"no net loss\\" policy regarding wetlands means that further channelization must be offset by creating new wetlands, called \\"mitigation lands\\", elsewhere. Much of the channelized flow is routed into the Obion River just above the mouth of that river into the Mississippi, other streams related to the system have their own mouths into the Mississippi. In some areas where the historic channels are left in place even after the bulk of the flow has been routed into new ones, the historic channels at times still demonstrate considerable flow, especially after heavy rains. Local historians record that barges and small riverboats plied the Forked Deer in the early 19th century as far up river as the present location of the city of Jackson. Siltation from agricultural run-off eventually choked the river, and channelization became a major focus of West Tennessee politicians until the 1970s. River cutoffs have left numerous small finger lakes that are popular with local crappie and bass fishers. Otherwise, the river is a slow-moving canal with little scenic appeal.

The sharpshooter, originally named sasori-gatame, scorpion hold in English,http://www.wwe.com/classics/sports-entertainment-maneuver- innovators-26099954/page-3 Who invented the Sharpshooter? is a professional wrestling submission hold. The move is similar to several other holds: cloverleaf leg-lace, Boston crab, standing reverse figure-four leglock, and, is also known by several other names, the most commonly known alternative being Scorpion Deathlock. The move was invented by Japanese professional wrestler Riki Choshu, and it was popularized by Sting who mostly does the standing variation rather than the sitting variation, but it is generally associated with Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart, who used the move extensively in his WWF career and gave it the now most commonly used name, the Sharpshooter.http://www.complex.com/sports/2015/12/the-20-most-iconic- finishing-moves-in-wrestling-history/sharpshooter The Sharpshooter hold begins with the opponent supine on the mat. The applying wrestler (A) steps between the opponent's (O) legs with their own left leg and wraps O's legs at shin level around that leg. If A decides to cross O's legs around A's own right leg, A has to cross O's right leg over O's left or the left leg over the right. Holding O's legs in place, A then grabs O's leg which they has crossed over the other and steps over O, flipping O over into a prone position before leaning back to compress O's lower back. This move is used more commonly by Canadian wrestlers, typically in Canada, to get a bigger crowd reaction, since the move is associated with Bret Hart and the Hart family.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/854243-wwetna-the-rock-and-the- top-5-sharpshooter-masters-of-all- timehttps://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/cesaro-sharpshooter- explained/https://www.f4wonline.com/japan/masa-saito-passes-away-after-long- battle-parkinsons-disease-261771 History and variations Natalya applying a double sharpshooter on Eve Torres and Layla. While Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart is the wrestler with whom the Sharpshooter is most often associated, Ronnie Garvin and Sting were the first wrestlers to prolifically use the hold in North America, during which time it was called the Scorpion Deathlock, deriving from the original Japanese name. In Hart's autobiography, he noted that prior to his first major singles push, Pat Patterson asked if he could do a \\"Scorpion Death Lock\\", which he was familiar with from Japan, but did not know how to execute. Hart revealed that the only person in the locker room who knew how to execute the move was Konnan, who taught it to Hart.The Pink & Black attacks Inbox - WWE Inbox - Episode 71 Its name was based on Hart's \\"Hit Man\\" nickname (from the underworld slang hit, murder). In WWF publications of the era, Bret's father Stu Hart, long known as a trainer in the game, was generally given credit for devising the move. Edge innovated a variation where he would apply the hold normally, only to face the opposite direction and kneel on the opponent's legs. The Sharpshooter was infamously used in the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series in 1997. Shawn Michaels applied Hart's own Sharpshooter on him. Vince McMahon double-crossed Hart by ordering referee Earl Hebner to ring the bell and award the match to Michaels, despite Hart never having submitted. This moment would be referenced within kayfabe through various future events; McMahon repeated the action at the next year's Survivor Series in 1998, as part of a storyline, during the \\"Deadly Game\\" tournament final between The Rock and Mankind. Another occurred on Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII, during a Street Fight between Shawn Michaels and Shane McMahon. = Scorpion cross lock = Also known as an inverted sharpshooter combined with a double chickenwing, this hold sets up the same as the sharpshooter, with the opponent supine on the mat with the applying wrestler stepping between the opponent's legs with their right leg, and wrapping the opponent's legs at shin level around that leg. However, instead of stepping over the opponent to flip them, the applying wrestler flips the opponent over from left-to-right, keeping the opponent in front of them. The applying wrestler then leans over the opponent and grabs their arms, applying a double chicken wing to the opponent. The applying wrestler then squats back, lifting the opponent's torso into the air. The move was used by Bull Nakano and formerly used by the former SmackDown general manager Paige.

An active sympathiser of Nazi Germany, he took part in German- produced propaganda broadcasts and is known as one of the men associated with the nickname Lord Haw-Haw. Early life Baillie-Stewart's father was Lieutenant Colonel Cron Hope Baillie Wright, an officer in the British Indian Army who served in the 62nd Punjabis during the First World War. His mother was from a family with a long tradition of military service. Baillie-Stewart attended Bedford School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where as a cadet, he served as an orderly to Prince Henry, a younger son of King George V. In January 1929, still a cadet, he changed his surname from Wright to Baillie-Stewart, perhaps under the belief that he was looked down upon by more senior officers. He graduated tenth in the order of merit and in February 1929 received a commission as a subaltern in the Seaforth Highlanders although he soon grew to dislike army life. In 1929, Baillie-Stewart was posted to the Seaforth's Second Battalion in India. In 1930, he saw active service on the North West Frontier, where he was reprimanded by his company commander for removing a native banner from an Afridi tribal graveyard, which aggravated tensions with local tribesmen. He later replaced the banner on the orders of a senior officer. A campaign medal was authorised for that campaign, but Baillie-Stewart did not receive it. The roll of recipients compiled in September 1933, after his conviction, noted against his name, \\"No medal, forfeited. Cashiered\\". He returned to England in early 1931 after he had applied for transfer to the Royal Army Service Corps. 1933 court martial The Vickers A1E1 Independent tank, the only example that was built, preserved at the Bovington Tank Museum (2010). In the spring of 1933, Baillie-Stewart was court-martialled at Chelsea Barracks under the Official Secrets Act for selling military secrets to a foreign power. Because Britain was not at war, Baillie-Stewart was not in danger of the death penalty, but the ten charges against him carried a maximum sentence of 140 years in jail. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The court was told that Baillie-Stewart began to offend in 1931 when he met and fell in love with a German woman while he was holidaying in Germany. He decided to become a German citizen and wrote a letter to the German Consul in London to offer his services. Receiving no answer, he travelled to Berlin without permission to take leave, where he telephoned the German Foreign Ministry and demanded to talk to an English- speaker. That resulted in him making contact with a Major Mueller under the Brandenburg Gate, where he agreed to spy for Germany. Using the pretext of studying for Staff College examinations, he borrowed from the Aldershot Military Library specifications and photographs of an experimental tank, the Vickers A1E1 Independent, as well as a new automatic rifle and notes on the organisation of tank and armoured car units.The Vickers A1E1 Independent was a large tank with five turrets; its experimental prototype was delivered in 1926. Several countries had an interest in multi-turret tanks during the Interwar Period, and Germany produced the Neubaufahrzeug between 1934 and 1936. The Vickers Independent also provided inspiration for the Soviet T-35. Experience during the early part of the Second World War showed that such tanks generally performed poorly in combat. It was charged that he had sold this material to a German known as \\"Otto Waldemar Obst\\" in return for which he received two letters signed \\"Marie-Luise\\", one containing ten ¬£5 notes and the other four ¬£10 notes. Evidence was also produced that he had also made several trips to the Netherlands to meet his handlers. MI5 files have since shown that Marie-Luise had been merely a figment of his controller's imagination. Major Mueller's covername was Obst (fruit) and Baillie-Stewart's was Poiret (little pear), and Marie-Luise, a type of pear, was used to conceal their correspondence. Ballie was convicted of seven of the ten charges against him and was imprisoned for five years. He was released from Maidstone Prison on 20 January 1937. He was initially held at the Tower of London and was the last British subject to be held there as a proper prisoner, rather than as one awaiting transfer.The Kray twins were imprisoned for a few days in the Tower of London in 1953 while they awaited transfer to Shepton Mallet Prison. See List of prisoners of the Tower of London. German collaboration After his release from prison in 1937, Baillie-Stewart moved to Vienna, where he applied for Austrian citizenship. However, it was refused since he did not meet the residency qualification. In August 1937, the Austrian government, led by Kurt Schuschnigg, suspected him of being a Nazi agent and gave him three weeks to leave Austria.Before it was overthrown by the 1938 Anschluss, the authoritarian Austrofascist government of Austria was very hostile to German Nazism. Baillie-Stewart's disenchantment with Britain was increased when the British embassy in Vienna refused to help him. Rather than return to Britain he went to Bratislava, which was then in Czechoslovakia. Following the Anschluss, Baillie-Stewart was able to return to Austria, where he made a modest living by operating a trading company. He applied for naturalisation, but the application was delayed by bureaucracy at the ministry, and he did not become a German citizen until 1940. In July 1939, Baillie-Stewart attended a friend's party in which he happened to hear some German English-language propaganda broadcasts. He criticised the broadcasts and was overheard by a guest at the party who happened to work at the Austrian radio station. He informed his superiors of Baillie-Stewart's comments, and after a successful voice test in Berlin, Baillie-Stewart was ordered by the German Propaganda Ministry to report to the Reich Broadcasting Corporation (Reichsrundfunk) in Berlin, where he became a propaganda broadcaster. Baillie-Stewart made his first broadcast reading pro-Nazi news on the Germany Calling English-language service a week before the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. It has been speculated that it was Baillie-Stewart who made the broadcast that led the pseudonymous Daily Express radio critic Jonah Barrington to coin the term \\"Haw-Haw\\". The nickname possibly referenced Baillie-Stewart's exaggeratedly aristocratic way of speaking, but Wolf Mittler, another English-speaking announcer, is sometimes considered a more likely candidate. When William Joyce later became the most prominent Nazi propaganda broadcaster, Barrington appended the title and named Joyce \\"Lord Haw-Haw\\" since the true identity of the broadcaster was then unknown. Another nickname possibly applied to Baillie-Stewart was \\"Sinister Sam\\".Nazi Wireless Propaganda: Lord Haw-Haw and British Public Opinion in the Second World War, Edinburgh University Press, 2000, page 13 By the end of September 1939, it had been clear to the radio authorities that Joyce, originally Baillie-Stewart's backup man, was more effective. Baillie-Stewart, who had gradually become disenchanted with the material that he had to broadcast, was dismissed in December 1939, shortly after his last radio broadcast. He continued to work in Berlin as a translator for the German Foreign Ministry and lectured in English at Berlin University. In early 1940, he acquired German citizenship. In early 1942, Baillie-Stewart made a brief return to radio under the alias of \\"Lancer\\". He made several broadcasts for both the Reichsrundfunk and Radio Luxembourg. He spent much time avoiding the more blatant propaganda material he was asked to present. He translated to English the words of \\"Lili Marleen\\", which were sung by Lale Andersen as a form of propaganda towards Allied soldiers but then taken up strongly by the Allies themselves.Christian Peters / Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Lili Marleen, Ein Schlager macht Geschichte, Bonn 2001. In 1944, Baillie-Stewart had himself sent to Vienna for medical treatment, where he was arrested in 1945 in Altaussee, while he was wearing \\"chamois leather shorts, embroidered braces and a forester's jacket\\", and was sent to Britain to face charges of high treason. Postwar Baillie- Stewart avoided execution only because the Attorney-General, Hartley Shawcross, did not think he could successfully try him on charges of high treason since he had German citizenship and instead decided to try him on the lesser charge of \\"committing an act likely to assist the enemy\\". The Security Service (MI5) reportedly lobbied for him to be sent to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, where there would be no \\"namby-pamby legal hair-splitting\\". The depositions from his trial are available in the British National Archives under reference CRIM 1/1750. Baillie-Stewart pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, and he then moved to Ireland under the pseudonym of James Scott, married, and settled in the Dublin suburb of Raheny. He had two children before he died of a heart attack after collapsing at a pub in Harmonstown in June 1966. At the time of his death, he had just completed his autobiography, which he had co-written with John Murdock and was published in 1967. Archives Papers held in The National Archives are KV 2/174 1932 Aug 30-1932 Nov 28 to KV 2/192 1933 Jan 01-1933 Dec 31. Also are Home Office files HO 45/25689 and HO 45/25787.

The doped material is referred to as an extrinsic semiconductor. A semiconductor doped to such high levels that it acts more like a conductor than a semiconductor is referred to as a degenerate semiconductor. In the context of phosphors and scintillators, doping is better known as activation. Doping is also used to control the color in some pigments. History The effects of semiconductor doping were long known empirically in such devices as crystal radio detectors and selenium rectifiers. For instance, in 1885 Shelford Bidwell, and in 1930 the German scientist Bernhard Gudden, each independently reported that the properties of semiconductors were due to the impurities contained within them. The doping process was formally first developed by John Robert Woodyard working at Sperry Gyroscope Company during World War II, with a US Patent issued in 1950.Woodyard, John R. \\"Nonlinear circuit device utilizing germanium\\" filed, 1944, granted 1950 The demands of his work on radar denied Woodyard the opportunity to pursue research on semiconductor doping. Similar work was performed at Bell Labs by Gordon K. Teal and Morgan Sparks, with a US Patent issued in 1953.Sparks, Morgan and Teal, Gordon K. \\"Method of Making P-N Junctions in Semiconductor Materials\\", (Filed June 15, 1950. Issued March 17, 1953) Woodyard's prior patent proved to be the grounds of extensive litigation by Sperry Rand. Carrier concentration The concentration of the dopant used affects many electrical properties. Most important is the material's charge carrier concentration. In an intrinsic semiconductor under thermal equilibrium, the concentrations of electrons and holes are equivalent. That is, :n = p = n_i.\\\\ In a non-intrinsic semiconductor under thermal equilibrium, the relation becomes (for low doping): :n_0 \\\\cdot p_0 = n_i^2\\\\ where n0 is the concentration of conducting electrons, p0 is the conducting hole concentration, and ni is the material's intrinsic carrier concentration. The intrinsic carrier concentration varies between materials and is dependent on temperature. Silicon's ni, for example, is roughly 1.08√ó1010 cm‚àí3 at 300 kelvins, about room temperature. In general, increased doping leads to increased conductivity due to the higher concentration of carriers. Degenerate (very highly doped) semiconductors have conductivity levels comparable to metals and are often used in integrated circuits as a replacement for metal. Often superscript plus and minus symbols are used to denote relative doping concentration in semiconductors. For example, n+ denotes an n-type semiconductor with a high, often degenerate, doping concentration. Similarly, p‚àí would indicate a very lightly doped p-type material. Even degenerate levels of doping imply low concentrations of impurities with respect to the base semiconductor. In intrinsic crystalline silicon, there are approximately 5√ó1022 atoms/cm3. Doping concentration for silicon semiconductors may range anywhere from 1013 cm‚àí3 to 1018 cm‚àí3. Doping concentration above about 1018 cm‚àí3 is considered degenerate at room temperature. Degenerately doped silicon contains a proportion of impurity to silicon on the order of parts per thousand. This proportion may be reduced to parts per billion in very lightly doped silicon. Typical concentration values fall somewhere in this range and are tailored to produce the desired properties in the device that the semiconductor is intended for. Effect on band structure Band diagram of PN junction operation in forward bias mode showing reducing depletion width. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1√ó1015/cm3 doping level, leading to built-in potential of ~0.59 V. Reducing depletion width can be inferred from the shrinking charge profile, as fewer dopants are exposed with increasing forward bias. Doping a semiconductor in a good crystal introduces allowed energy states within the band gap, but very close to the energy band that corresponds to the dopant type. In other words, electron donor impurities create states near the conduction band while electron acceptor impurities create states near the valence band. The gap between these energy states and the nearest energy band is usually referred to as dopant-site bonding energy or EB and is relatively small. For example, the EB for boron in silicon bulk is 0.045 eV, compared with silicon's band gap of about 1.12 eV. Because EB is so small, room temperature is hot enough to thermally ionize practically all of the dopant atoms and create free charge carriers in the conduction or valence bands. Dopants also have the important effect of shifting the energy bands relative to the Fermi level. The energy band that corresponds with the dopant with the greatest concentration ends up closer to the Fermi level. Since the Fermi level must remain constant in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, stacking layers of materials with different properties leads to many useful electrical properties induced by band bending, if the interfaces can be made cleanly enough. For example, the p-n junction's properties are due to the band bending that happens as a result of the necessity to line up the bands in contacting regions of p-type and n-type material. This effect is shown in a band diagram. The band diagram typically indicates the variation in the valence band and conduction band edges versus some spatial dimension, often denoted x. The Fermi level is also usually indicated in the diagram. Sometimes the intrinsic Fermi level, Ei, which is the Fermi level in the absence of doping, is shown. These diagrams are useful in explaining the operation of many kinds of semiconductor devices. =Relationship to carrier concentration (low doping)= For low levels of doping, the relevant energy states are populated sparsely by electrons (conduction band) or holes (valence band). It is possible to write simple expressions for the electron and hole carrier concentrations, by ignoring Pauli exclusion (via Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics): :n_e = N_{\\\\rm C}(T) \\\\exp((E_{\\\\rm F} - E_{\\\\rm C})/kT), \\\\quad n_h = N_{\\\\rm V}(T) \\\\exp((E_{\\\\rm V} - E_{\\\\rm F})/kT), where is the Fermi level, is the minimum energy of the conduction band, and is the maximum energy of the valence band. These are related to the value of the intrinsic concentration via :n_i^2 = n_h n_e = N_{\\\\rm V}(T) N_{\\\\rm C}(T) \\\\exp((E_{\\\\rm V}-E_{\\\\rm C})/kT), an expression which is independent of the doping level, since (the band gap) does not change with doping. The concentration factors and are given by :N_{\\\\rm C}(T) = 2(2\\\\pi m_e^* kT/h^2)^{3/2} \\\\quad N_{\\\\rm V}(T) = 2(2\\\\pi m_h^* kT/h^2)^{3/2}. where and are the density of states effective masses of electrons and holes, respectively, quantities that are roughly constant over temperature. Techniques of doping and synthesis The synthesis of n-type semiconductors may involve the use of vapor-phase epitaxy. In vapor-phase epitaxy, a gas containing the negative dopant is passed over the substrate wafer. In the case of n-type GaAs doping, hydrogen sulfide is passed over the gallium arsenide, and sulfur is incorporated into the structure. This process is characterized by a constant concentration of sulfur on the surface. In the case of semiconductors in general, only a very thin layer of the wafer needs to be doped in order to obtain the desired electronic properties. The reaction conditions typically range from 600 to 800 ¬∞C for the n-doping with group VI elements, and the time is typically 6‚Äì12 hours depending on the temperature. Process Some dopants are added as the (usually silicon) boule is grown, giving each wafer an almost uniform initial doping. To define circuit elements, selected areas ‚Äî typically controlled by photolithography ‚Äî are further doped by such processes as diffusionComputer History Museum ‚Äì The Silicon Engine 1954 ‚Äì Diffusion Process Developed for Transistors and ion implantation, the latter method being more popular in large production runs because of increased controllability. Small numbers of dopant atoms can change the ability of a semiconductor to conduct electricity. When on the order of one dopant atom is added per 100 million atoms, the doping is said to be low or light. When many more dopant atoms are added, on the order of one per ten thousand atoms, the doping is referred to as high or heavy. This is often shown as n+ for n-type doping or p+ for p-type doping. (See the article on semiconductors for a more detailed description of the doping mechanism.) Dopant elements =Group IV semiconductors= (Note: When discussing periodic table groups, semiconductor physicists always use an older notation, not the current IUPAC group notation. For example, the carbon group is called \\"Group IV\\", not \\"Group 14\\".) For the Group IV semiconductors such as diamond, silicon, germanium, silicon carbide, and silicon germanium, the most common dopants are acceptors from Group III or donors from Group V elements. Boron, arsenic, phosphorus, and occasionally gallium are used to dope silicon. Boron is the p-type dopant of choice for silicon integrated circuit production because it diffuses at a rate that makes junction depths easily controllable. Phosphorus is typically used for bulk-doping of silicon wafers, while arsenic is used to diffuse junctions, because it diffuses more slowly than phosphorus and is thus more controllable. By doping pure silicon with Group V elements such as phosphorus, extra valence electrons are added that become unbonded from individual atoms and allow the compound to be an electrically conductive n-type semiconductor. Doping with Group III elements, which are missing the fourth valence electron, creates \\"broken bonds\\" (holes) in the silicon lattice that are free to move. The result is an electrically conductive p-type semiconductor. In this context, a Group V element is said to behave as an electron donor, and a group III element as an acceptor. This is a key concept in the physics of a diode. A very heavily doped semiconductor behaves more like a good conductor (metal) and thus exhibits more linear positive thermal coefficient. Such effect is used for instance in sensistors.Cheruku, Dharma Raj and Krishna, Battula Tirumala (2008) Electronic Devices and Circuits, 2nd edition, Delhi, India, Lower dosage of doping is used in other types (NTC or PTC) thermistors. =Silicon dopants= *Acceptors, p-type **Boron is a p-type dopant. Its diffusion rate allows easy control of junction depths. Common in CMOS technology. Can be added by diffusion of diborane gas. The only acceptor with sufficient solubility for efficient emitters in transistors and other applications requiring extremely high dopant concentrations. Boron diffuses about as fast as phosphorus. **Aluminum, used for deep p-diffusions. Not popular in VLSI and ULSI. Also a common unintentional impurity. **Gallium is a dopant used for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors in the 8‚Äì14 ¬µm atmospheric window. Gallium-doped silicon is also promising for solar cells, due to its long minority carrier lifetime with no lifetime degradation; as such it is gaining importance as a replacement of boron doped substrates for solar cell applications. **Indium is a dopant used for long- wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors in the 3‚Äì5 ¬µm atmospheric window. *Donors, n-type **Phosphorus is a n-type dopant. It diffuses fast, so is usually used for bulk doping, or for well formation. Used in solar cells. Can be added by diffusion of phosphine gas. Bulk doping can be achieved by nuclear transmutation, by irradiation of pure silicon with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Phosphorus also traps gold atoms, which otherwise quickly diffuse through silicon and act as recombination centers. **Arsenic is a n-type dopant. Its slower diffusion allows using it for diffused junctions. Used for buried layers. Has similar atomic radius to silicon, high concentrations can be achieved. Its diffusivity is about a tenth of phosphorus or boron, so it is used where the dopant should stay in place during subsequent thermal processing. Useful for shallow diffusions where well-controlled abrupt boundary is desired. Preferred dopant in VLSI circuits. Preferred dopant in low resistivity ranges. **Antimony is a n-type dopant. It has a small diffusion coefficient. Used for buried layers. Has diffusivity similar to arsenic, is used as its alternative. Its diffusion is virtually purely substitutional, with no interstitials, so it is free of anomalous effects. For this superior property, it is sometimes used in VLSI instead of arsenic. Heavy doping with antimony is important for power devices. Heavily antimony-doped silicon has lower concentration of oxygen impurities; minimal autodoping effects make it suitable for epitaxial substrates. **Bismuth is a promising dopant for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors, a viable n-type alternative to the p-type gallium-doped material. **Lithium is used for doping silicon for radiation hardened solar cells. The lithium presence anneals defects in the lattice produced by protons and neutrons. Lithium can be introduced to boron-doped p+ silicon, in amounts low enough to maintain the p character of the material, or in large enough amount to counterdope it to low-resistivity n type.Weinberg, Irving and Brandhorst, Henry W. Jr. (1984) \\"Lithium counterdoped silicon solar cell\\" *Other **Germanium can be used for band gap engineering. Germanium layer also inhibits diffusion of boron during the annealing steps, allowing ultrashallow p-MOSFET junctions. Germanium bulk doping suppresses large void defects, increases internal gettering, and improves wafer mechanical strength. **Silicon, germanium and xenon can be used as ion beams for pre-amorphization of silicon wafer surfaces. Formation of an amorphous layer beneath the surface allows forming ultrashallow junctions for p-MOSFETs. **Nitrogen is important for growing defect-free silicon crystal. Improves mechanical strength of the lattice, increases bulk microdefect generation, suppresses vacancy agglomeration. **Gold and platinum are used for minority carrier lifetime control. They are used in some infrared detection applications. Gold introduces a donor level 0.35 eV above the valence band and an acceptor level 0.54 eV below the conduction band. Platinum introduces a donor level also at 0.35 eV above the valence band, but its acceptor level is only 0.26 eV below conduction band; as the acceptor level in n-type silicon is shallower, the space charge generation rate is lower and therefore the leakage current is also lower than for gold doping. At high injection levels platinum performs better for lifetime reduction. Reverse recovery of bipolar devices is more dependent on the low-level lifetime, and its reduction is better performed by gold. Gold provides a good tradeoff between forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time for fast switching bipolar devices, where charge stored in base and collector regions must be minimized. Conversely, in many power transistors a long minority carrier lifetime is required to achieve good gain, and the gold/platinum impurities must be kept low. =Other semiconductors= *Gallium arsenide ** n-type: tellurium, sulphur (substituting As), tin, silicon, germanium (substituting Ga) ** p-type: beryllium, zinc, chromium (substituting Ga), silicon, germanium (substituting As) *Gallium phosphide ** n-type: tellurium, selenium, sulphur (substituting phosphorus) ** p-type: zinc, magnesium (substituting Ga), tin (substituting P) *Gallium nitride, Indium gallium nitride, Aluminium gallium nitride ** n-type: silicon (substituting Ga), germanium (substituting Ga, better lattice match), carbon (substituting Ga, naturally embedding into MOVPE-grown layers in low concentration) ** p-type: magnesium (substituting Ga) - challenging due to relatively high ionisation energy above the valence band edge, strong diffusion of interstitial Mg, hydrogen complexes passivating of Mg acceptors and by Mg self-compensation at higher concentrations) *Cadmium telluride ** n-type: indium, aluminium (substituting Cd), chlorine (substituting Te) ** p-type: phosphorus (substituting Te), lithium, sodium (substituting Cd) *Cadmium sulfide ** n-type: gallium (substituting Cd), iodine, fluorine (substituting S) ** p-type: lithium, sodium (substituting Cd) Compensation In most cases many types of impurities will be present in the resultant doped semiconductor. If an equal number of donors and acceptors are present in the semiconductor, the extra core electrons provided by the former will be used to satisfy the broken bonds due to the latter, so that doping produces no free carriers of either type. This phenomenon is known as compensation, and occurs at the p-n junction in the vast majority of semiconductor devices. Partial compensation, where donors outnumber acceptors or vice versa, allows device makers to repeatedly reverse (invert) the type of a given portion of the material by applying successively higher doses of dopants, so-called counterdoping. Most modern semiconductors are made by successive selective counterdoping steps to create the necessary P and N type areas.Hastings, Alan (2005) The Art of Analog Layout, 2nd ed. Although compensation can be used to increase or decrease the number of donors or acceptors, the electron and hole mobility is always decreased by compensation because mobility is affected by the sum of the donor and acceptor ions. Doping in conductive polymers Conductive polymers can be doped by adding chemical reactants to oxidize, or sometimes reduce, the system so that electrons are pushed into the conducting orbitals within the already potentially conducting system. There are two primary methods of doping a conductive polymer, both of which use an oxidation-reduction (i.e., redox) process. # Chemical doping involves exposing a polymer such as melanin, typically a thin film, to an oxidant such as iodine or bromine. Alternatively, the polymer can be exposed to a reductant; this method is far less common, and typically involves alkali metals. # Electrochemical doping involves suspending a polymer-coated, working electrode in an electrolyte solution in which the polymer is insoluble along with separate counter and reference electrodes. An electric potential difference is created between the electrodes that causes a charge and the appropriate counter ion from the electrolyte to enter the polymer in the form of electron addition (i.e., n-doping) or removal (i.e., p-doping). N-doping is much less common because the Earth's atmosphere is oxygen-rich, thus creating an oxidizing environment. An electron-rich, n-doped polymer will react immediately with elemental oxygen to de-dope (i.e., reoxidize to the neutral state) the polymer. Thus, chemical n-doping must be performed in an environment of inert gas (e.g., argon). Electrochemical n-doping is far more common in research, because it is easier to exclude oxygen from a solvent in a sealed flask. However, it is unlikely that n-doped conductive polymers are available commercially.  Doping in organic molecular semiconductors  Molecular dopants are preferred in doping molecular semiconductors due to their compatibilities of processing with the host, that is, similar evaporation temperatures or controllable solubility. Additionally, the relatively large sizes of molecular dopants compared with those of metal ion dopants (such as Li+ and Mo6+) are generally beneficial, yielding excellent spatial confinement for use in multilayer structures, such as OLEDs and Organic solar cells. Typical p-type dopants include F4-TCNQ and Mo(tfd)3. However, similar to the problem encountered in doping conductive polymers, air-stable n-dopants suitable for materials with low electron affinity (EA) are still elusive. Recently, photoactivation with a combination of cleavable dimeric dopants, such as [RuCp‚àóMes]2, suggests a new path to realize effective n-doping in low-EA materials. Magnetic doping Research on magnetic doping has shown that considerable alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity; for example, dopant impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys can generate different properties as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl and Nakamura. The inclusion of dopant elements to impart dilute magnetism is of growing significance in the field of Magnetic semiconductors. The presence of disperse ferromagnetic species is key to the functionality of emerging Spintronics, a class of systems that utilise electron spin in addition to charge. Using Density functional theory(DFT) the temperature dependent magnetic behaviour of dopants within a given lattice can be modeled to identify candidate semiconductor systems.  Single dopants in semiconductors  The sensitive dependence of a semiconductor's properties on dopants has provided an extensive range of tunable phenomena to explore and apply to devices. It is possible to identify the effects of a solitary dopant on commercial device performance as well as on the fundamental properties of a semiconductor material. New applications have become available that require the discrete character of a single dopant, such as single-spin devices in the area of quantum information or single-dopant transistors. Dramatic advances in the past decade towards observing, controllably creating and manipulating single dopants, as well as their application in novel devices have allowed opening the new field of solotronics (solitary dopant optoelectronics). Neutron transmutation doping  Neutron transmutation doping (NTD) is an unusual doping method for special applications. Most commonly, it is used to dope silicon n-type in high-power electronics and semiconductor detectors. It is based on the conversion of the Si-30 isotope into phosphorus atom by neutron absorption as follows: ::: ^{30}\\\\mathrm{Si} \\\\, (n,\\\\gamma) \\\\, ^{31}\\\\mathrm{Si} \\\\rightarrow \\\\, ^{31}\\\\mathrm{P} + \\\\beta^- \\\\; (\\\\mathrm{T}_{1/2} = 2.62 h). In practice, the silicon is typically placed near a nuclear reactor to receive the neutrons. As neutrons continue to pass through the silicon, more and more phosphorus atoms are produced by transmutation, and therefore the doping becomes more and more strongly n-type. NTD is a far less common doping method than diffusion or ion implantation, but it has the advantage of creating an extremely uniform dopant distribution.Baliga, B. J. (1987) Modern Power Devices, John Wiley & Sons, New York, p. 32. Modulation doping  Modulation doping is a synthesis technique in which the dopants are spatially separated from the carriers. In this way, carrier-donor scattering is suppressed, allowing very high mobility to be attained.

In great extent, it was identical with the HVDC back-to-back station in Etzenricht, which was used for coupling the power grids of Bavaria and Czech and built at the same time.

However, at GK Vienna- Southeast were not used as in the HVDC back-to-back station in Etzenricht six single-phase transformers, but four three-phase transformers. While the facility in Etzenricht got obsolete in 1995 after synchronisation of power grids in Western and Eastern Europe, GK Vienna-Southeast remained in service at first, because the direct interconnection of power grids of Austria and Hungary would have caused regulation-technical problems as result of the missing national 380 kV grid in Austria. These problems were solved in 1996 with the installation of frequency regulation equipment in coal-fired power stations in Southern Poland, so GK Vienna Southeast GK got unessential in October 1996 and was shut down.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 8, 2011 is the longest river located entirely within the U.S. state of Tennessee. Free flowing for most of its length, the Duck River is home to over 50 species of freshwater mussels and 151 species of fish, making it the most biologically diverse river in North America. The Duck River drains a significant portion of Middle Tennessee. It rises in hills near an area of Middle Tennessee known as the \\"Barrens\\", an area with enough rainfall to support a woodland but which white settlers found already deforested upon their arrival. (Several theories have been advanced to explain this phenomenon.) It enters the city of Manchester and meets its confluence with a major tributary, the Little Duck River, at Old Stone Fort State Park, named after an ancient Native American structure between the two rivers believed to be nearly 2,000 years old. Other major towns along the Duck include Shelbyville, Columbia, and Centerville. Below Shelbyville to the Southeast, the Duck is impounded by Normandy Dam, a Tennessee Valley Authority project of the early 1970s which was built for flood control and recreation. Normandy was not equipped for power generation as were previous TVA dams built in Middle Tennessee. The structure was named for the hamlet of Normandy, which is nearby. The resultant reservoir occupies over of what was previously prime land for agriculture. Further downstream, Shelbyville is protected from potential Duck River flooding by levees and floodgates. A dam constructed by the Tennessee Electric Power Company across the river adjacent to downtown Shelbyville is a relic of the early electrical development of the area prior to the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Blue Hole Falls along the Duck River near Manchester Downstream in Maury County is the Yanahli Wildlife Preserve, occupying land which was meant to be another TVA reservoir. The Columbia Dam was never completed, however, when an endangered species of mussel was found in this section of the Duck and studies showed the project costs would far exceed benefits. After years of litigation, the dam, which was largely completed, was dismantled at a loss approaching $80,000,000 of public funds. Another old Tennessee Electric Power Company dam, somewhat similar to the one in downtown Shelbyville, is located downstream of the uncompleted dam site. Private funds have been spent on this dam to rehabilitate it to resume electrical power production; however, this has not proven to be successful. The Duck River frequently floods parts of Columbia, particularly the neighborhoods near downtown. Between Columbia and Centerville, the Duck cuts through the Western Highland Rim and is joined by several major tributaries, notably the Piney River. Downtown Centerville is located high above the Duck River bottoms. Below Centerville, the Duck again enters a fairly rural, somewhat remote area. Its largest single tributary, the Buffalo River, reaches its confluence with the Duck in southern Humphreys County, just a few miles from the mouth of the Duck into the Tennessee River. The area of the mouth of the Duck is part of the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge.

He was the son of Suleiman Frangieh, a former Lebanese president.  Education and early political career  Frangieh was educated at the College Des Fr√®res Tripoli, first in Tripoli then in Beirut, at the latter from 1958 to 1960. He was furthering his studies before his death. Frangieh began his career dealing with his family business. On 25 October 1970, he succeeded his father, Suleiman Frangieh, as a member of the Lebanese Parliament for Zgharta, following his father's election to the Presidency. He was also appointed the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in his father's government.  Civil war  At the end of the 1960s, when factions within Lebanon started to form militias, the Frangieh clan formed the Marada Brigade, also known as the Zgharta Liberation Army (ZLA), under the command of Tony Frangieh. The Marada/ZLA mainly operated out of Tripoli and northern Lebanon, the base of the Frangieh family. The Lebanese Civil War witnessed many shifting alliances where the allies of today became the enemies of tomorrow. One such falling out occurred between two of the leading Maronite clans, the Frangiehs and the Gemayels. The Frangiehs, who were close to Syria, were critical of Phalangist Kataeb Regulatory Forces' militia leader Bachir Gemayel's growing alliance with Israel. Militiamen from the Phalange RF and Marada also clashed over protection rackets. This conflict led to the murder of Tony Frangieh, his wife, Vera (n√©e el Kordahi), and his three-year-old daughter Jihane by Phalangist militiamen, known as the Ehden massacre. His son, Suleiman II, was in Beirut during the murder.Hoy and Ostrovsky, By Way of Deception (1990), p. 302.Katz, Russel, and Volstad, Armies in Lebanon (1985), p. 8.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 79. Under cover of darkness on 13 June 1978, a combined force of 1,200 Phalangists led by Elie Hobeika and Samir Geagea, attacked and killed Tony Frangieh and his immediate family, thereby eliminating one of the protagonists vying for political power in the Christian Lebanese community.William Darymple, From the Holy Mountain, Harper Press, , p. 253 Suleiman Frangieh never vowed revenge. As he stated in a documentary on a Lebanese political channel called 'OTV', \\"That was the past and it must be forgotten, I do not seek revenge because God is the only judge, thus their conscience will haunt them for the rest of their lives.\\" Many commentators consider the murder of Tony Frangieh to be one of the factors in the longevity of the Lebanese Civil War and as the starting point of a deep divide between Lebanese Christians. Some 20,000 mourners attended his funeral, including then Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss on 14 June 1978.  Personal life  Frangieh had two children, Suleiman Frangieh Jr. and Jihane, with Vera Frangieh, whom he married in 1962. His son Suleiman first became the Minister of Public Health at the age of 22, and he served as the Ministry of Interior from 2004 to 2005. He is known to have served with the Marada Brigade in the 1980s.

Characterizing the behavior of decision-makers as using subjective expected utility was promoted and axiomatized by L. J. Savage in 1954Savage, Leonard J. 1954. The Foundations of Statistics. New York, Wiley.Karni, Edi. \\"Savage's subjective expected utility model.\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Second Edition. Eds. Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. Palgrave Macmillan, 2008. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online. Palgrave Macmillan. 23 August 2014 following previous work by Ramsey and von Neumann.Ramsey says that his essay merely elaborates on the ideas of Charles Sanders Peirce. John von Neumann noted the possibility of simultaneous theory of personal probability and utility, but his death left the specification of an axiomatization of subjective expected utility incomplete. The theory of subjective expected utility combines two subjective concepts: first, a personal utility function, and second a personal probability distribution (usually based on Bayesian probability theory). Savage proved that, if the decision-maker adheres to axioms of rationality, believing an uncertain event has possible outcomes \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\} each with a utility of u(x_i), then the person's choices can be explained as arising from this utility function combined with the subjective belief that there is a probability of each outcome, P(x_i). The subjective expected utility is the resulting expected value of the utility, :\\\\Epsilon[u(X)] = \\\\sum_i \\\\; u(x_i) \\\\; P(x_i) . If instead of choosing \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\} the person were to choose \\\\\\\\{y_j\\\\\\\\}, the person's subjective expected utility would be :\\\\Epsilon[u(Y)] = \\\\sum_j \\\\; u(y_j) \\\\; P(y_j). Which decision the person prefers depends on which subjective expected utility is higher. Different people may make different decisions because they may have different utility functions or different beliefs about the probabilities of different outcomes. Savage assumed that it is possible to take convex combinations of decisions and that preferences would be preserved. So if a person prefers x(=\\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\}) to y (=\\\\\\\\{y_i\\\\\\\\})and s(=\\\\\\\\{s_i\\\\\\\\}) to t(=\\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}) then that person will prefer \\\\lambda x + (1-\\\\lambda )s to \\\\lambda y + (1-\\\\lambda )t, for any 0<\\\\lambda<1. Experiments have shown that many individuals do not behave in a manner consistent with Savage's axioms of subjective expected utility, e.g. most prominently Allais (1953) and Ellsberg (1961).

It was patented in 1954 and came into medical use in 1959. Mechanism of action Tetryzoline is an alpha agonist for alpha-2 receptor and imidazoline receptor I-1 agonist. Mainly due to its alpha-2 agonism it can constrict conjuctival blood vessels of the eye when taken in the form of eye drops. This relieves the redness of the eye caused by minor ocular irritants. To treat allergic conjunctivitis, tetryzoline can be combined in a solution with antazoline. In an overdose, slow heart rate and low blood pressure are mainly due to imidazoline-1 receptor agonism. Dry mouth and sedating effects are due to alpha-2 agonism. Side effects Tetryzoline eye drops may cause blurred vision, eye irritation and dilated pupils. Tetryzoline is not suitable for prolonged use as its vasoconstrictive effects within the eye eventually decrease or stop. If tolerance to the drug has developed, ceasing its use may cause a rebound effect and increase redness of the eyes ‚Äî ‚Å†a vasodilatory effect. Intranasal use of tetryzoline may cause transient burning, stinging, or dryness of the mucosa and sneezing. Prolonged intranasal use often causes opposite effects in the form of rebound congestion with effects such as chronic redness, swelling and rhinitis. Prolonged use thus may result in overuse of the drug. Overdose most often causes slow heart rate. Respiratory depression, low blood pressure, constricted pupils, hypothermia, brief episodes of high blood pressure, drowsiness, headaches and vomiting may also occur. In serious cases some of these effects may result in circulatory shock. Most often overdoses occur in children who have ingested the drug. There is no antidote for tetryzoline or other similar imidazoline analogue poisoning, but the symptoms can be alleviated and with treatment, death is rare. Pharmacokinetics Half-life of tetryzoline in healthy people is about 6 hours and it is excreted unchanged in urine, at least in part. In one study 10 people were given 2 drops of 0.5 mg/ml tetryzoline eye drops (0.025‚Äì0.05 mg) at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h. Within 24 h time window since the last dose, tetryzoline blood serum concentration of the subjects was 13.0‚Äì210.0 ng/ml and urine concentration was 11‚Äì400 ng/ml. Both reached their maximum about 9 h post last dose. These levels correspond to normal ocular use of tetryzoline. Higher concentrations may indicate misuse of the drug or poisoning. Chemistry Chemically, tetryzoline is a derivative of imidazoline. It has two enantiomers. Society and culture =Names= Tetryzoline is the INN. =Urban legend= An urban legend suggests that tetryzoline can cause violent diarrhea if given orally, such as by putting a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting person's beverage. However, the actual results of the prank may be worse, varying from severe nausea and vomiting to seizures or a coma. Diarrhea is not a side effect. =Criminal use= In late August 2018, a South Carolina woman was charged with murdering her husband by putting eye drops containing tetryzoline in his drinking water. An autopsy found high concentrations of tetryzoline in his body. Tetryzoline has been used as a date rape drug in a number of cases due to its ability to cause dizziness and unconsciousness.

The series was created by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall. The show was produced by Verity Lambert with Rex Firkin as Executive Producer. In an interview for the 2006 DVD release Lambert stated that the series was originally going to be called \\"The Loser\\" but this was rejected by the TV Network. The show had two theme songs: the first was \\"The Loner\\" by The Milton Hunter Orchestra, and the second was \\"Nobody's Fool\\" written by Ray Davies and performed by Cold Turkey. Series plot The series consisted of a sequence of stories - sometimes spread across two episodes - depicting Budgie's involvement in some hare-brained scheme to make money, usually somewhere on the wrong side of legality, and invariably for the local boss, Mr Endell. He often failed in his aim, being continually the victim of circumstance or of the sharper, more experienced underworld operators he tried to emulate. The opening credits were particularly iconic: showing Budgie trying to grab large numbers of banknotes blowing in the wind. Plots included: *Trying to unload thousands of stolen ballpoint pens he has unwisely bought from one fence, paying too much in the process. He finds that the pens are all stamped with a logo, possibly \\"Her Majesty's Government\\", making them unsellable. Apparently these were the classic \\"trading commodity\\", the only object being to sell them to another sucker. Charlie offers to take them off Budgie's hands for next to nothing in exchange for a favour or two, and promptly unloads them to another villain. *Arranging a pornographic film show in a hotel and having assured the \\"punters\\" that the film was \\"the real Laurel and Hardy, if you know what I mean\\", making his escape before they find out the film really is a Laurel and Hardy movie. *Accidentally stealing a vanload of pornographic magazines from the police, and then having to destroy the evidence. The wind blows the pages from the bonfire Budgie and his pal have made and they blow all over a field where a prison wardens-versus-prisoners rugby match is imminently to be played. =Series One= The story begins with Ronald Bird (nicknamed \\"Budgie\\") being released from an open prison and trying to find a living in whatever way possible. He meets Charlie Endell in a bar with a 15 year old stripper (Adrienne Posta) and Endell asks Budgie to look after her for a week. Budgie asks his part-time actress girlfriend Hazel Fletcher (Lynn Dalby) to help. In the one hour pilot he accidentally steals the wrong Ford Transit but this is beneficial as it is a police-owned van full of confiscated pornography heading for destruction. Budgie reckons he can sell it, however Mr Endell insists that he burns it all. The wind catches the paper and the pornography blows off the bonfire just as a busload of cricket players arrive. Budgie comes away with a fruit machine from the cricket club which he takes to Hazel's flat. They drive off but his assistant Grogan says he is going off with Charity (the stripper). Budgie is left to explain this to Mr Endell. Eventually all his supposed friends desert him; he ends up back in court for handling stolen goods: a fruit machine stolen from a cricket club and featured in the storyline of the first episode. In reality, Charlie Endell has shopped him for this. Ironically one of Budgie's lesser crimes, he is found guilty... not helped by poor advice from his lawyer. =Series Two= Series two begins with Budgie in an \\"open nick\\": Fern Open Prison. Fellow prisoners include Wossname Walsh (source: IMDb) (James Bolam). Budgie has three weeks left until release. He has had few visitors until Mr Endell comes, but only is there to retrieve ¬£3000 from another prisoner, Dutchy Holland (Bill Dean). Budgie will get a 10% cut if he can retrieve this. When Budgie is released two cars are waiting: his ex-wife and Charlie. He must choose. On release (episode two of series 2) he stays with his wife for a few days. He encounters a street preacher (Gordon Jackson) who leads \\"The Brothers of Happiness\\". A chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend Hazel, who is now living with someone else, and Budgie finding out that his wife has been sleeping with a friend of Budgie's, from the same open prison, force Budgie to move back in with his girlfriend and his son Howard, who is now two years old. Budgie carried on much as he did in the first series, which also started with him being released from the same open prison from a previous sentence. The second series ended with him being beaten up by both his boss and one of his henchmen. This, combined with the fact that Budgie's mother has recently died, his father not wanting him, his girlfriend becoming pregnant by Budgie, and that he wants to leave Hazel for a stripper he has recently slept with who then tells him that she is moving abroad, makes Budgie even more depressed and eventually makes him head off into a new life. This is where the series ended; nothing more was heard of Budgie. Cast The title role, a chirpy cockney petty criminal newly out of prison, was played by pop singer Adam Faith; it was his first starring role for television.Budgie  A Television Heaven Review The character's name was Ronald 'Budgie' Bird, nicknamed after the budgerigar birds sometimes kept as pets in England. The series co-starred Iain Cuthbertson as Charles (Charlie) Endell, a suave and Machiavellian Glaswegian gangster based in London, who employed Budgie, often against his own better judgement, or when he was in need of an unsuspecting fall guy. June Lewis played his silent wife Mrs Endell. During the late 1970s, Scottish Television produced a short-lived spin-off series, Charles Endell Esquire. The only other regular member of the cast was Lynn Dalby as Budgie's girlfriend, Hazel Fletcher. Stella Tanner had a semi-regular role as her mother, Mrs Fletcher. Rio Fanning appeared three times as Budgie's gullible criminal Irish pal, Grogan. Guest stars included Georgina Hale as Budgie's wife Jean, George Tovey as his father, Jack Bird, and Adrienne Posta as a stripper. John Rhys-Davies had an early semi-regular role as a corpulent gangster working for Endell, with the name of Laughing Spam Fritter. Budgie's dad Jack Bird is played by George Tovey and his mum Alice by Julia McCarthy. His sister Violet (Vi) is played by Anne Carrol. Vi's fiancee/husband Tony Pringle is played by Donald Douglas. The neighbour Mrs L. is Barbara New. Charlie Endell's mousey wife is played by June Lewis. Series two broadened the characters to include Endell's secretary, Mrs Beecham (Nan Munro) and Budgie's wife (Georgina Hale). Avril Elgar played Mrs Silverstone, a rich woman being fleeced by a fake religious movement led by \\"Soapy Simon\\" (Gordon Jackson). Production Two series, each of 13 episodes, were made. Although colour equipment had been introduced two years earlier, the first four episodes were made in monochrome because of industrial action. A further series may have been planned for 1973, although this coincided with Adam Faith being seriously injured in a car crash, and announcing his retirement from acting as a result. Despite a full recovery by Faith and his eventual return to acting, a further series was never commissioned. Retrieved 31/08/07 Musical version A musical based on the characters of the series (but featuring only Adam Faith from the original TV cast), with a book by the scriptwriters of the original series, opened at the Cambridge Theatre in London on 18 October 1988, and ran for three months.

Biography Keith Waterhouse was born in Hunslet, Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He did two years of national service in the Royal Air Force. His credits, many with lifelong friend and collaborator Willis Hall, include satires such as That Was The Week That Was, BBC-3 and The Frost Report during the 1960s; the book for the 1975 musical The Card; Budgie; Worzel Gummidge; and Andy Capp (an adaptation of the comic strip). His 1959 book Billy Liar was subsequently filmed by John Schlesinger with Tom Courtenay as Billy. It was nominated in six categories of the 1964 BAFTA awards, including Best Screenplay, and was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1963; in the early 1970s the sitcom Billy Liar based on the character was quite popular and ran to 25 episodes. Waterhouse's first screenplay was the film Whistle Down the Wind (1961). Without receiving screen credit, Waterhouse and Hall extensively rewrote the original script for Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain (1966). Waterhouse wrote the comic play, Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell (1989; Old Vic premiere, 1999), based on the louche life of London journalist Jeffrey Bernard. His career began at the Yorkshire Evening Post and he also wrote regularly for Punch, the Daily Mirror, and latterly for the Daily Mail. He initially joined the Mirror as a reporter in 1952, before he became a playwright and novelist; during his initial stint, he campaigned against the colour bar in post-war Britain,\\"Black, blind hate\\", Daily Mirror, 15 March 1954, page 7, and \\"The shame of a Jim Crow city\\", Daily Mirror, 16 March 1954, also page 7 the abuses committed in the name of the British Empire in Kenya\\"The newspaper with a blind eye\\", Daily Mirror, 7 September 1955, page 2 and the British government's selling of weapons to various Middle Eastern countries.\\"A very, very nasty smell indeed\\", Daily Mirror, 31 December 1955, page 1 Subsequently, he returned as a columnist, initially in the Mirror Magazine, moving to the main newspaper on 22 June 1970, on Mondays, and extending to Thursdays from 16 July 1970. Extracts from the columns were published in the books Mondays, Thursdays and Rhubarb, Rhubarb and Other Noises. His extended style book for the Daily Mirror, Waterhouse on Newspaper Style,http://www.mantex.co.uk/reviews/water.htm A review and history of the book can be found here is regarded as a classic textbook for modern journalism. This was followed by a pocket book on English usage intended for a wider audience entitled English Our English (And How To Sing It). He moved from the Mirror to the Mail in 1986 out of his objection to the Mirror's ownership by Robert Maxwell, and remained at the Mail until shortly before his death. He fought long crusades to highlight what he perceived to be a decline in the standards of modern English; for example, he founded the Association for the Abolition of the Aberrant Apostrophe, whose members attempt to stem the tide of such solecisms as \\"potatoe's\\" and \\"pound's of apple's and orange's\\" in greengrocers' shops. In February 2004, he was voted Britain's most admired contemporary columnist by the British Journalism Review. On 4 September 2009, a statement released by his family announced that Waterhouse had died quietly in his sleep at his home in London. He was 80.

Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was \\"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\\" He graduated from the University of Michigan and later worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors. His most noted work was the 1954 book The Foundations of Statistics, in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory. During World War II, Savage served as chief \\"statistical\\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one the participants to the Macy conferences on cybernetics. One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \\"random walk\\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.

The series takes its name from the character in George Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The series launched on July 5, 2000 on CBS and is currently the second longest-running adaptation in the Big Brother franchise to date after the Spanish version. The show broadly follows the premise of other versions of the format, in which a group of contestants, known as \\"HouseGuests\\" live together in a specially constructed house that is isolated from the outside world. The HouseGuests are continuously monitored during their stay in the house by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, HouseGuests are evicted from the house, by being voted out of the competition. The last remaining HouseGuest wins the competition and is awarded a cash prize of $500,000. In its inaugural season (which followed the original Dutch format), ratings declined and critical reaction grew increasingly negative prompting the series to be revamped for the second season, which focused on competition and gameplay. On May 15, 2019, it was announced that the series had been renewed through its 22nd season. CBS later announced on May 20, 2019 that the 21st season would premiere on June 25, 2019. On July 23, 2020, after production delays due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the 22nd season would be an \\"All-Stars\\" edition (consisting of only previous houseguests), premiering on August 5, 2020. The \\"All-Stars\\" format was originally used in season 7. In addition to the main series, there have been two spin-offs: Big Brother: Over the Top, which aired for one season and was the first reality game show to air exclusively on a streaming platform airing in Fall 2016 on CBS' streaming service, CBS All Access; and Celebrity Big Brother, which aired on CBS in February 2018. History =Series= A view of CBS Studio Center sound stage 18, where the house is located The series was bought by CBS in early 2000 for an estimated $20 million. The American version of the series officially premiered on July 5, 2000, when the original ten housemates entered the house. Since its inception, the show has been hosted by television personality Julie Chen Moonves. It is produced by Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan for Fly on the Wall Entertainment and Endemol Shine North America (formerly Endemol USA). The success of the series has spawned several spin-offs. The series airs once a year, during the summer, with the exception of the ninth season which aired in the spring of 2008 and the Over the Top spinoff series broadcasting in fall 2016. Currently, 22 seasons of the show have aired, along with one digital season. Season 22 premiered on August 5, 2020. The show has aired a total of 746 episodes since it premiered, with the September 5, 2013 airing marking the 500th episode.'Big Brother' USA: Two houseguests evicted during 500th episode Digital Spy, September 5, 2013 To date, there have been a total of 272 HouseGuests compete in the series. Upon entering the house, the HouseGuests must abide the rules set in the house; HouseGuests can anytime leave the house without permission, or be forcibly removed from the game if they broke any rules, such as exhibiting violent and disruptive behavior. In both cases, these HouseGuests are not allowed to return to the house and usually incorporated with a penalty such as not allowed to be involved in a jury. To date, three HouseGuests withdrew from the competition and four HouseGuests were expelled from the House because of a rule violation. =Companion shows= Since its premiere, there have been numerous companion programs about the show. In 2004, the web series House Calls: The Big Brother Talk Show (2004-2008) began airing. The series, which lasted for thirty minutes and aired on weeknights, allowed fans to call in and discuss the events of the game. This made House Calls the first live Internet talk show produced exclusively for a television network. The series was initially hosted by Gretchen Massey and Big Brother 3 HouseGuest Marcellas Reynolds during its first two seasons. Beginning with the show's third season, a new co-host was featured on the series each day, with some returning more than once. During the show's fifth and sixth seasons, each co-host was given a designated day of the week to host alongside Gretchen. Following the show's sixth season, it was confirmed that it would not be renewed. Big Brother: After Dark, a second companion series, was debuted in 2007 and aired on Showtime Too nightly from 12:00 midnight-3:00am Eastern Time.CBS plans 'Big Brother' spin-off Variety The series continued this schedule until 2013, at which point it was moved to TVGN (now Pop), where it remains today. Former HouseGuest Jeff Schroeder began hosting the Big Brother: Live Chat online discussion show in 2012, where he interviewed the HouseGuests both before they enter the house and following their evictions. He also performed post-finale backyard interviews with the cast. On August 10, 2017, Schroeder announced that he was moving to Colorado and would no longer be able to do the interviews. For Big Brother 20, the \\"Live Chat\\" was replaced by Off the Block with Ross and Marissa. Hosted by former Celebrity HouseGuests Marissa Jaret Winokur and Ross Mathews, the show is set to air on Fridays on Facebook following the live eviction. =Spin-offs= There have been two spin-off editions of Big Brother. In October 2016, CBS premiered a spin-off web series, Big Brother: Over the Top, as an original series for CBS All Access. Unlike the flagship, television version, it was broadcast exclusively online with a shorter, 10-week season. The second spin-off, Celebrity Big Brother, aired its first season on CBS on February 7, 2018. Celebrity Big Brother was renewed for a second season, which premiered on January 21, 2019 and concluded on February 13. However, on January 1, 2020, CBS announced there will be no Celebrity Big Brother this year. Though not an actual spin-off, the Canadian edition of the series is the first and, currently, only series to adopt the full American format of Big Brother. However, other franchises have used elements of the American format, including the 2020 revival of the Big Brother Australia, which uses an altered version of the American format with the Australian public still deciding the eventual winner. Other franchises such as Big Brother Brasil soon adopted individual elements from the American format (Veto Competition, Have/Have-Nots, and Head of Household) into their format while still maintaining the international public vote format for weekly evictions. Format Big Brother is a game show in which a group of contestants, referred to as HouseGuests, live in a custom-built \\"house\\" (actually a set built on a CBS stage in Los Angeles, Stage 18 since season 6), constantly under video surveillance. While in the house, the contestants are completely isolated from the outside world, meaning no phone, television, Internet, magazines, newspapers or contact with those not in the house. This rule could be broken, however, in the event of a medical injury, a family emergency or death. The format of the series is mainly seen as a social experiment, and requires HouseGuests to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices. While a competition, the series allows viewers to witness the relationships formed in the house and the behavior of the HouseGuests. Though locked in the house, the HouseGuests are free to quit the game, though they will not be allowed entry back into the house. Should a HouseGuest break the rules of the game, they could be expelled from the house and unable to return. The contestants compete for a grand prize of $500,000. = Season 1 Format= The premiere season, the format of the show resembled the original Dutch version of the show-- a format adapted by most versions. As the format of the show emphasized the social experiment aspects of the premise, the competitive aspects were minimized: HouseGuests did not compete for power or safety, and the nominations process was not discussed by the HouseGuests. Every two weeks, each HouseGuest participated in a mandatory voting called Nomination which decide a list of HouseGuests nominated for eviction, also known as \\"Marked for banishment\\". Each HouseGuest secretly nominated two other fellow housemates, providing full reasons for their nominations. In the event of a tie, the two or more HouseGuests with the most nominations became marked for banishment and faced the public vote for the following week. Towards the end of the season, the nominations process reverted to a weekly process. After the nominations were finalized, a public voting window opens for America who vote for which HouseGuest would be banished through televoting. This process continued until three HouseGuests remained, where the final vote was changed to determine the winner of the show. The winner won the $500,000 prize, the runner-up left with $100,000 and 3rd place left with $50,000. The competition however, received negative reception from both critics and viewers. =Season 2-present= Big Brother 14 winner Ian Terry, with the Diamond Power of Veto Having spent millions on the series, CBS issued a second season of the series and announced that various changes would occur with the format The current format of the series is focused more on competition and strategy than the original series, which makes a resemblance to the format from another CBS show, Survivor. At the start of each week in the house, the HouseGuests compete for three types of competitions, Head of Household, Have-Not, and the Power of Veto. For the Head of Household, HouseGuest compete for immunity from eviction and the power to nominate two HouseGuest for the eviction, and often receive privileges such as their own personal bedroom and free laundry service; however, the incumbent Head of Household would not be able to compete in the following week's Head of Household competition, meaning that a HouseGuest could not hold the title for a second consecutive week, except for the final week or other stated circumstances. For the Power of Veto (introduced in Season 3), any HouseGuests compete for the right to replace any nominated HouseGuest from the eviction, which would continue until three HouseGuest remains. Introduced in Season 7 is Have-Not competitions, where losing HouseGuests were penalized with a \\"Have- Not\\" diet by eating slop and sleep in a special bedroom for the remainder of the week. At the end of the week, all HouseGuests except for three (the Head of Household and the two nominees) would then cast a vote, one-by-one, to determine which of the two nominees should be evicted; the HouseGuest receiving a majority of the eligible HouseGuest's votes is evicted during a live episode; if there is a tie in the voting, the reigning Head of Household is required to publicly make the tie-breaker decision. Unlike other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests may discuss the nomination and eviction process openly and freely. Since season 5, the \\"Double Eviction Week\\" or \\"Fast Forward Week\\" with the game events of the week (HoH and Veto Competitions, as well as Nominations, Veto and Eviction cermoneies) occur in an accelerated format, so that two HouseGuests are evicted over a week. The \\"Double Eviction Week\\" has become a staple of the show, particularly in the penultimate week featuring the Final 5 and Final 4 evictions. Another variation of the Double Eviction was introduced in the first season 7 with the \\"Double Eviction Night\\" where the events of the week occur over the course of the Live Eviction episode, with the event also becoming a staple of the show. The 22nd season, introduced the \\"Triple Eviction Night\\", where two weeks worth of game events are played within an extended Live Eviction episode so that three HouseGuests are evicted. The \\"Triple Eviction Night\\" was previously used on Big Brother Canada with a different format - where a single live round was played, with three Nominees and Two HouseGuests being evicted. About halfway through the game, the evicted HouseGuests become members of the Big Brother Jury; this Jury vote on the winner of the series between the Two Finalist. The members of the Jury are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. In seasons 2 and 3, all HouseGuests who were evicted except those who either walked or removed from the game are not eligible, but due to a possibility of a tie and an American public vote is decisive, the jury is only eligible for only the seven recently evicted HouseGuests beginning season 4 (known as Jury of Seven), before increasing to nine members (Jury of Nine) starting season 15. Once only two HouseGuests remain, the members of the Jury would cast the votes to decide the winner by placing their keys with the name to the slots (versus stating their choice to eliminate, as in all other votes). The winning HouseGuest wins a $500,000 cash prize and the runner-up with $50,000. Members who either walked or removed but was part of the Jury remained as a member but is not allowed to vote, instead the vote is decided by the public, as it was first seen in season 11 where Chima Simone was removed from the game while she was still part of the jury and host Chen Moonves represented her vote in her behalf; the America voted eventual winner Jordan Lloyd to win, which it does in a 5-2 vote. Jessie Godderz holds the record for most appearances on Big Brother with two appearances as a HouseGuest and nine appearances as a special guest. To keep the series intriguing, each season typically features a new twist to change the format of the game. This began with Season 3 and the famous \\"Expect the Unexpected\\" twist. Other seasons feature smaller twists that have a smaller impact on the game, usually affecting that sole week. The most notable example of this is Pandora's Box, a twist that originated in Season 11. The twist sees the current Head of Household for that week being tempted by the box, and can choose to either open the box or leave it. Should a HouseGuest choose to open Pandora's Box, both good and bad consequences could be unleashed into the house; these can affect not only the Head of Household, but the other housemates, possibly including the HouseGuest who opens it. Similar formats are applied in later seasons, for example, the Den of Temptation introduced in season 19. Secret powers have also appeared in the past. Mike Malin was the first HouseGuest to receive a secret power, earning the Coup d'√âtat during Big Brother: All-Stars (2006). The Coup d'√âtat allowed the holder to remove one or both nominees from the block on eviction night, as well as choose who is nominated in their place. Malin chose not to use the power and it subsequently returned during Big Brother 11 (2009) when Schroeder was given the power by the viewers. Matt Hoffman was given a Diamond Power of Veto during Big Brother 12 (2010), which allowed him to remove one HouseGuest from the block and choose the replacement nominee. During Season 14, HouseGuest and eventual winner Ian Terry won a second Power of Veto, which have the same functionality as a regular Power of Veto. Many seasons have featured twists in which evicted HouseGuests can win reentry into the house, either by public vote or competition. Normally, this involves sequestering each eliminated contestant individually or in the jury house (depending on whether the twist occurred pre-jury or post-jury, respectively). Contestants who 'self-evict' (quit the game voluntarily) or was 'forcibly removed' (expelled from the game due to a rule violation) are ineligible to return in these twists. Examples of the twists employed in various seasons are listed below. *In season 3, the first four evictees were asked what they would give up to re-enter the house and the two that listed the most faced a house vote. *In season 6, the first four evictees faced a public vote. *In season 9, the first six evictees faced a public vote, before facing a house vote on whether to bring back the most recent evictee or the \\"mystery HouseGuest\\" chosen by America. *In season 13, the first four evictees faced a public vote before the winner competed against the most recent, evictee for reentry. *Each Season from 15 to 18 in addition to season 20, the first few jurors competed in a competition to re-enter. In seasons 15, 17 and 18, said competition coincided with that week's Head of Household competition. *In seasons 18 and 19 the first five evictees competed in a series of knockout competitions until the last competition where the winning HouseGuest won reentry. *In season 20, one of the Power Apps granted a contestant a chance at reentry upon eviction. *In season 21, a twist allowed four HouseGuests to be banished and compete in a challenge to allow reentry in a game; later, the banished HouseGuest and the first three evictees would be sequestered in a \\"Camp Comeback\\" after the first eviction and would compete in a challenge at the end of the third week where the winning HouseGuest won reentry. Jessie Godderz has made the most Big Brother appearances in the show's history by far, appearing in Seasons 10 and 11 as a Houseguest and then again in Seasons 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 20 and also on Celebrity Big Brother Season 1, in surprise return Special Guest Appearances. He also appeared in a special Big Brother Press Day edition of the series exclusively for CBS.com during Season 16. Victor Arroyo is the first HouseGuest to be evicted three times in the same season, having won two separate Battle Back competitions to gain reentry into the house, only to be permanently evicted on Day 90, taking fifth place. Cliff Hogg III became the second HouseGuest to be eliminated from the game three times. He was first banished and won re-entry, then he was evicted and won the Camp Comeback competition to gain reentry into the house, only to be permanently evicted on Day 93, taking fourth place. Dan Gheesling and Paul Abrahamian are the only players that have lasted until the Final 2 in two separate seasons and faced a final jury vote; the former became the first HouseGuest to win with an unanimous Jury vote of 7-0 during the first season appearance (the other HouseGuest was Tamar Braxton on the second Celebrity season); the latter however, become the first HouseGuest to neither win a season during his two appearances after losing to Nicole Franzel and Josh Martinez, both in a 5-4 jury vote. America's Favorite HouseGuest Introduced in the first All- stars season in season 7 and has done so in all season finale except season 8 and Over-The-Top, viewers of Big Brother would cast a vote to decide the fan favorite HouseGuest this season for a cash award of $25,000. The results are announced following the finale of the respective season. During the season's debut, the award is only eligible to the Jury of Seven (hence the award was called America's Favorite Juror or America's Choice Jury Prize), before expanding the eligibility to all HouseGuests (including the winner) beginning Season 11. HouseGuests who either walked or expelled from the season are ineligible. The voting percentages were also revealed live but it has been dropped since Season 17. Broadcast Julie Chen, seen here with Les Moonves, has hosted the series since its premiere. Since its launch in the United States, Big Brother has aired on CBS. The show is simulcast in Canada on Global. The fourth and ninth seasons have both aired in the United Kingdom, the latter airing in the Spring season. The first season featured a total of six episodes per week, though all future installments would air three nights per week. Of these three episodes, the weekly eviction episode is the only one that is live; this is the only episode to feature host Julie Chen. This show generally airs on Thursdays. To date, there have been a total of 746 episodes of the series to air. With the exception of the ninth season, the series typically airs once a year during the summer season. The first 15 seasons aired in standard definition, with the 16th season being the first to be produced in HD. However, the live internet feeds would not broadcast in HD until Big Brother 17. Before the series made the transfer, it was the last remaining regularly scheduled prime-time series to remain in standard definition. CBS released the entire third season as a nine-disc set on Region 1 DVD. This made it the first season to receive an official release, and has since become a rare item to find. The fourth season saw the release of a two- disc highlights DVD, featuring previously unseen footage deemed too racy for the main broadcast. To date, these are the only seasons to see a physical release. Beginning with the seventh season, all future seasons are available for purchase on digital retail sites. With the 15th season, TVGN (now Pop) began airing re-runs of the series at later dates, making it the first season to be aired following its premiere; this continued with the 16th season. Subscribers to CBS All Access are able to stream the complete run of Big Brother-- including the differently-formatted first season-- and an episode of Big Brother 2 that did not air in most markets due to ongoing coverage of the September 11 attacks. CBS aired the spin-off series Celebrity Big Brother from February 7‚Äì25, 2018. It was the first spin-off to air on the broadcast network and the second season overall to air in the winter television season (the other being season 9). The celebrity edition aired in a concentrated run with fewer episodes, but with multiple episodes each week. =Live Internet feeds= One of the main aspects of the series is the live feeds, in which viewers can view inside the house at any time. The live feeds have been a part of the series since its inception, initially being offered as a free service during the first season. From the second season onward, a subscription to the live feeds has been required, with the price ranging each year. The first season's feeds were available on the show's official site, hosted by AOL. From the second season to the 14th season, the feeds were available through RealNetworks either as a subscription or as a free addition for Gold members. With the 15th season onward, the live feeds have aired on the official CBS website, again requiring a subscription from users. Though advertised as being available at any time, the feeds are shut off during the weekly nomination ceremony, Power of Veto ceremony, and the competitions and evictions for that week; this is to provide suspense for the series. Slanderous statements and singing of copyrighted music are also blocked for legal reasons. Competitions =Head of Household (HOH)= The Head of Household competition is held at the beginning of each week and is most often occurred during the live eviction episode. Most often, the first Head of Household competition will require HouseGuests to participate either in pairs or in teams. While the fourth, fifth and eighth seasons had the HouseGuests competing in pairs, seasons 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 all saw HouseGuests participated as group. The live Head of Household competitions are typically question-based, and will see HouseGuests eliminated in each round. Competitions such as \\"Majority Rules\\" have been used numerous times, with the game being played in the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, 10th and 12th seasons; a variation of the competition was used in the seventh season. Some competitions will attempt to cause drama in the house, such as the \\"En Garde\\" Head of Household competition, in which the winner of each round selected the next two to face off against one another. This competition was later used in the 10th through 16th seasons. Various competitions throughout the season will be endurance, requiring HouseGuests to be the last one remaining in the competition. Endurance competitions are often held after game changing announcements, such as when a previously evicted HouseGuest returns. Various endurance competitions may have punished or rewarded contestants who either fall off first or last. Skill-based competitions also appear frequently throughout the season, some of which may last for numerous hours. Skill competitions, such as the 13th season's \\"Big Brother Open\\", are finished during the live eviction broadcast. The final Head of Household competition of each season features three rounds; the first is endurance-based, the second is skill-based (often with a memory component), and the final is question-based. The record for most Head of Household competitions won in a single season is four (4), which were held by Drew Daniel, Janelle Pierzina, Hayden Moss, Rachel Reilly, Ian Terry, Aaryn Gries, Caleb Reynolds, Vanessa Rousso, Steve Moses and Jackson Michie in terms of reigns. Frankie Grande won HOH five times in the 16th season; however, he was dethroned twice due to the dual HoH twist that was in play during his season and his third reign was rewound due to the rewind button twist, leaving him with just two full reigns as HoH. Ian Terry and Jackson Michie share the record for most consecutive Head of Household wins, with four (both winning at the Final 9, 7, 5 and 3 rounds). One of the Head of Household's duties is to nominate two HouseGuests for eviction, or in the case of Final three, to evict. Victoria Rafaeli from the 16th season holds the record for most times being nominated with ten. =Power of Veto (PoV)= The Power of Veto symbol, used since its creation The Power of Veto is a power first introduced in Big Brother 3. During its first season, it did not allow a nominated HouseGuest to use it on themselves. The final Power of Veto that season was the Golden Power of Veto and allowed a nominated HouseGuest to remove themselves from the block. Following this, the Golden Power of Veto was used in all subsequent seasons. The Diamond Power of Veto, used in Big Brother 12, allowed one HouseGuest to remove themselves from the block. as well as choose the replacement nominee only moments before the live eviction. Power of Veto competitions differ drastically from the Head of Household competition, with PoV competitions being more skill-based in nature. Competitions such as the \\"Pop Goes the Veto!\\" competition, which required HouseGuests to find letter tiles and spell the longest word, have been used in numerous consecutive seasons. Competitions such as the \\"Big Brother Boardwalk\\" competition see HouseGuests attempting to guess how much of an item there is; this is one of various competitions that do not require HouseGuests to compete in a physical-based competition. The \\"How Bad Do You Want It?\\" Power of Veto competition, first introduced in the seventh season, saw HouseGuests taking punishments in exchange for advancing in the competition. Variations of this competition have been used in numerous subsequent seasons. HouseGuests Janelle Pierzina (S7), Daniele Donato (S8), Paul Abrahamian (S19), and Kaycee Clark (S20) currently hold the record for most Power of Veto wins in a single season, with five wins each. HouseGuests James Zinkand, Frank Eudy, Shane Meaney and Kaycee Clark all hold the record for most consecutive Power of Veto wins, with three each. =Food and luxury= Food and luxury competitions have been a part of the series since it first premiered. In early seasons, the losers of the food competition would be placed on a peanut butter and jelly diet and would not be permitted to eat any other foods. Beginning with Season 7, the losers of the Have-Not competition were required to eat \\"Big Brother Slop\\" for food, sleep in the Have-Not bedroom and take cold showers for the week. Slop has proven to be an issue for some HouseGuests; in both cases on Season 9, hypoglycemic HouseGuest Amanda Hansen fainted and had a seizure after only a few days of being on the slop diet, while HouseGuest Allison Nichols had an allergic reaction to the slop; both women were medically evacuated from the house, though they returned the following morning. The second All-stars season also have \\"Have-Not\\" competitions but subsequent weeks forego competitions and instead decided by the previous recipients of Have- Nots, except for only a few weeks which reset the process. In the first week of Have-Not competition that followed, losers picked envelopes by random; four envelopes held a \\"Have-Not\\" card, meaning that four HouseGuests were \\"Have- Nots\\" for the week and could decide the next HouseGuest to receive \\"Have-Not\\" for the subsequent week, but the HouseGuest could not select the reigning HoH nor current Have-Nots. The first reset occurred on Week 5 and a Have-Not competition were held on the week after, in which three HouseGuests were subjected to Have-Nots; a second reset occurred on Week 10 where the Have-Nots twist for the season has ended. The number of Have-Nots were also reduced by one every three evictions. HouseGuests can be penalized for not following Have-Not rules, which is usually incorporated with a penalty vote for eviction; three HouseGuests had, to date, been penalized for the infraction and in all cases, they were ultimately evicted on the following week's eviction: HouseGuest Jen Johnson from season 8 was the first HouseGuest to do so, followed by Audrey Middleton (S17) and Matt Clines (S19). Season 11 HouseGuests Jeff Schroeder and Kevin Campbell also had broke the rule, however by a lesser degree, they instead penalized for an extra day on the slop diet instead. Season 21 winner Jackson Michie also have broke the rule but was not issued a penalty due to the obstruction of the camera view behind the shower walls while eating non-slop, resulting in the Have-Not being unseen for the remainder of that season. The HouseGuests also frequently compete in luxury competitions during their time in the house, with most frequently, the right to watch a film or television show in the house. When competitions for films or television shows occur, an actor or actress from the series may enter the house to host the competition or speak with the HouseGuests. Actors such as Jeremy Piven, David Hasselhoff and Neil Patrick Harris have all entered the house to participate in luxury competitions or rewards. =Battle of the Block= The Battle of the Block was first introduced during season 16 and was reintroduced during the following season's premiere; Instead of the normal singular Head of Household (HOH), two HOHs were named for that week. Each would then nominate a pair of nominees. These two pairs of nominees would compete against each other in a competition. The winning pair would receive immunity and if nominated, the and incumbent HOH that nominated them would be dethroned and losing immunity, allowing the other HOH sole power for the rest of the week. There were eight Battle of the Block competitions in season 16 and five in season 17. =Battle Back= The Battle Back Competition allows an evicted HouseGuest to return into the house and play as if they had never left. While elements of this competition first appeared in Season 15, it was officially introduced in Season 18 and returned to play a role in subsequent seasons as well. *In Seasons 15 and 17, the first four jurors competed in the HOH competition alongside the remaining houseguests. The winner of the competing jury members would be put back in the house and had the possibility to win HOH in the same competition. The winners of these competitions were Judd Daugherty and John McGuire, who finished in fifth and fourth place, respectively, in their respective seasons. *In Season 16, the first four jury members competed only against each other to make their way back into the house. The winner was Nicole Franzel, who beat Hayden Voss, Zach Rance and Jocasta Odom. *During Season 18, the first two evicted houseguests battled one on one, and the winner went on to compete against the third. The winner of that matchup would face the next evicted HouseGuest, and the winner of the final match-up re-entered the game. Victor Arroyo was the winner. Also in that season, Jury members competed alongside the HouseGuests still in the game. The last HouseGuest standing became the new HoH, while the last Jury member standing returned to the game. Victor won this Battle Back, making him the first HouseGuest in Big Brother history to re-enter the game in the same season for a third time. This version of the Battle Back did not return for season 19. *During Season 19, the first four evicted HouseGuests played against each other in one competition. The top two then played head-to-head and the winner then had to face off against a member inside the house. If the evicted HouseGuest won, they would re-enter the game. However, if the non- evicted HouseGuest won, no one would re-enter the game and all four evicted HouseGuests would be permanently eliminated. Cody Nickson beat Paul Abrahamian in the final round and re-entered the game. *During Season 20, the first four evicted Jury members played against each other in one competition. Scottie Salton beat out his competitors Bayleigh Dayton, Angie \\"Rockstar\\" Lantry and Faysal Shafaat and re-entered the game. *During Season 21, the first four evicted HouseGuests became members of Camp Comeback and did not exit the house following their evictions. After four HouseGuests were evicted, they competed in the Comeback Competition to re-enter the game. Cliff Hogg III beat out his competitors David Alexander, Ovi Kabir and Kemi Fakunle and re-entered the game. Series overview Controversy and criticism Since its inception, Big Brother has been criticized following reports of \\"HIB\\" (Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying), violence in the house, obscene language, breach of integrity, and the physical and mental strain of appearing on the series. Several seasons have also been criticized for racism and discrimination, most notably season 15 and season 21. On September 9, 2018, Chen's husband, Leslie Moonves, resigned as President of CBS after a second wave of reports of sexual misconduct allegations against him. On September 13, Chen closed out that evening's episode by saying, \\"From outside the Big Brother house, I'm Julie Chen Moonves. Good night.\\" As Chen had previously never used Moonves professionally, many saw the move as Chen standing in solidarity with her husband. Following her resignation from The Talk on September 18 after eight years as co-host, there was speculation on whether Chen would continue as host of Big Brother. She returned to host the following year.

It includes the great majority of dinosaurs with armor in the form of bony osteoderms, similar to turtles. Ankylosaurs were bulky quadrupeds, with short, powerful limbs. They are known to have first appeared in the early Jurassic Period, and persisted until the end of the Cretaceous Period. They have been found on every continent. The first dinosaur discovered in Antarctica was the ankylosaurian Antarctopelta, fossils of which were recovered from Ross Island in 1986. Ankylosauria was first named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1923.Osborn, H. F. (1923). \\"Two Lower Cretaceous dinosaurs of Mongolia.\\" American Museum Novitates, 95: 1‚Äì10. In the Linnaean classification system, the group is usually considered either a suborder or an infraorder. It is contained within the group Thyreophora, which also includes the stegosaurs, armored dinosaurs known for their combination of plates and spikes. Paleobiology They sported a very small brain size in proportion to their body, second only to the Saurischian sauropods. They were also rather slow moving, largely because of the shortness of the limbs combined with being incapable of running. Their top speed was likely less than . =Armor= Armour of Edmontonia All ankylosaurians had armor over much of their bodies, mostly scutes and nodules, with large spines in some cases. The scutes, or plates, are rectangular to oval objects organized in transverse (side to side) rows, often with keels on the upper surface. Smaller nodules and plates filled in the open spaces between large plates. In all three groups, the first two rows of plates tend to form a sort of half-ring around the neck; in nodosaurids, this comes from adjacent plates fusing with each other (and there is a third row as well), while ankylosaurids usually have the plates fused to the top of another band of bone. The skull has armor plastered on to it, including a distinctive piece on the outside-rear of the lower jaw. =Diet and feeding= Ankylosaurs were built low to the ground, typically one foot off the ground surface. They had small, triangular teeth that were loosely packed, similar to stegosaurs. The large hyoid bones left in skeletons indicates that they had long, flexible tongues. They also had a large, side secondary palate. This means that they could breathe while chewing, unlike crocodiles. Their expanded gut region suggests the use of fermentation to digest their food, using symbiotic bacteria and gut flora. Their diet likely consisted of ferns, cycads, and angiosperms. Mallon et al. (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent of Laramidia during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that ankylosaurs were generally restricted to feeding on vegetation at, or below, the height of 1 meter. =Reproduction= Possible neonate-sized ankylosaur fossils have been documented in the scientific literature.Tanke, D.H. and Brett-Surman, M.K. 2001.

In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life‚ÄîNew Research Inspired by the Paleontology of Philip J. Currie. Edited by D.H. Tanke and K. Carpenter. Indiana University Press: Bloomington. xviii + 577 pp. Classification Ankylosauria is usually split into two families: Nodosauridae (the nodosaurids) and Ankylosauridae (the ankylosaurids). A third family, the Polacanthidae, is sometimes used,Hayashi, S., Carpenter, K., Scheyer, T.M., Watabe, M. and Suzuki. D. (2010). \\"Function and evolution of ankylosaur dermal armor.\\" Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 55(2): 213-228. but is more often found to be a sub-group of one of the primary families.Thompson, R.S., Parish, J.C., Maidment, S.C.R. and Barrett, P.M. (2012). \\"Phylogeny of the ankylosaurian dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Thyreophora).\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 10(2): 301-312. The first formal definition of Ankylosauria as a clade, a group containing all species of a certain evolutionary branch, was given in 1997 by Carpenter.Carpenter, K., 1997, \\"Ankylosauria\\" pp. 16-20 in: P.J. Currie and K. Padian (eds.), Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs, Academic Press, San Diego He defined the group as all dinosaurs (more precisely: all thyreophoran Ornithischia) closer to Ankylosaurus than to Stegosaurus. This definition is essentially followed by most paleontologists today. This \\"stem- based\\" definition means that the primitive armored dinosaur Scelidosaurus, which is slightly closer to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids, is technically a member of Ankylosauria. Upon the discovery of Bienosaurus, Dong Zhiming (2001) erected the family Scelidosauridae for both of these primitive ankylosaurs. In 2001, Carpenter proposed a new group uniting Scelidosaurus, Ankylosauridae, Nodosauridae, and Polacanthidae, with Minmi (thought to be a primitive ankylosaurian), to the exclusion of Stegosaurus. However, many taxonomists find that Ankylosauromorpha is an invalid group. =Nodosauridae= This group traditionally includes Nodosaurus, Edmontonia, and Sauropelta. The nodosauridae had longer snouts than their ankylosaurid cousins. They did not sport the archetypal 'clubs' at the ends of their tails; but, rather, their most pronounced physical features were their spikes. Nodosaurids had very muscular shoulders and a specialized knob of bone on each shoulder blade called the acromial process. It served as an attachment site for the muscles that held up their large parascapular spines. These spines would be used for self-defense against predators. They also had wide, flaring hips and thick limbs. They had smaller, narrow beaks than the ankylosaurids, which likely allowed them to be very selective over what plant matter they grazed on. Most nodosaurid finds are from North America. =Ankylosauridae= Major differences distinguishing the ankylosaurids from the nodosaurids is that the ankylosaurids had bony clubs at the end of their tails, domed snouts in front of the eyes, and large squamosal plates projecting from the top and bottom of each side of the skull, all of which nodosaurids lacked. The traditional ankylosaurids are from later in the Cretaceous. They had much wider bodies and have even been discovered with bony eyelids. The large clubs at the end of their tails may have been used in self-defense (swung at predators) or in sexual selection. This family included Ankylosaurus, Euoplocephalus, and Pinacosaurus. The clubs were made of several plates of bone that were permeated by soft tissue, allowing them to absorb thousands of pounds of force. Their beaks were larger and broader than the nodosaurids, indicating that these ankylosaurs were generalists in their diet. =Polacanthidae= The family Polacanthidae was named by George Reber Wieland in 1911 to refer to a group of ankylosaurs that seemed to him to be intermediate between the ankylosaurids and nodosaurids.G.R. Wieland, 1911, \\"Notes on the armored Dinosauria\\", The American Journal of Science, series 4 31: 112-124 This grouping was ignored by most researchers until the late 1990s, when it was used as a subfamily (Polacanthinae) by Kirkland for a natural group recovered by his 1998 analysis suggesting that Polacanthus, Gastonia, and Mymoorapelta were closely related within the family Ankylosauridae. Kenneth Carpenter resurrected the name Polacanthidae for a similar group that he also found to be closer to ankylosaurids than to nodosaurids. Carpenter became the first to define Polacanthidae as all dinosaurs closer to Gastonia than to either Edmontonia or Euoplocephalus. Most subsequent researchers placed polacanthines as primitive ankylosaurids, though mostly without any rigorous study to demonstrate this idea. The first comprehensive study of 'polacanthid' relationships, published in 2012, found that they are either an unnatural grouping of primitive nodosaurids, or a valid subfamily at the base of Nodosauridae. Taxonomy While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, a few 21st-century publications have retained the use of ranks, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most have listed Thyreophora as an unranked taxon containing the traditional suborders Stegosauria and Ankylosauria, though Thyreophora is also sometimes classified as a suborder, with Ankylosauria and Stegosauria as infraorders. A simplified version of one possible classification follows: * Order Ornithischia (the \\"bird hipped\\" dinosaurs) ** Clade Thyreophora (armored dinosaurs) *** Clade Eurypoda (advanced armored dinosaurs) **** Clade Ankylosauria ***** Family Ankylosauridae ****** Subfamily Ankylosaurinae ***** Family Nodosauridae ****** Subfamily Polacanthinae?

The peppermint flavoured Polo was first manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1948, by employee John Bargewell at the Rowntree's Factory, York, and a range of flavours followed. The name derives from \\"polar\\", referencing the cool, fresh taste of the mint.  History  Polo mints, which resemble the confectioneries Life Savers and British Navy Sweets, were developed by Rowntree's in 1939, but their introduction to the market was delayed until 1947, by the onset of the Second World War. Polo fruits followed soon afterward.  Varieties  Over the years Rowntree and Nestl√© have come up with variations of the original Polo mint. Some of these have been successes, whereas others have failed. None has been as successful as the original Polo mint. * Spearmint: \\"Cool look, cool taste.\\" These Polos have a strong spearmint flavour and aroma. The original design of the sweets had turquoise flecks on them, and were mildly triboluminescent, but now are clear. * Fruit: These are boiled sweets in several fruit flavours, all in one tube. Flavours include strawberry, blackcurrant, orange, lemon, and lime. * Polo Gummies: Fruit flavoured soft gummy sweets in the Polo shape. * Sugar free: Sugar free version of the original Polo containing sorbitol. * Mini Strong Polos: Tiny Polos (about 0.5 cm in diameter) with a strong minty flavour. They were packaged in a box shaped like a Polo Mint. They were also available in a not- so-successful flavour * Smoothies: These creamy sweets came in flavours such as blackcurrant, sunshine fruits and strawberry. * Citrus Sharp: Lemon and lime flavoured. Discontinued in the United Kingdom. * Butter Mint Polos: mint flavour butterscotch. * Strong/Extra Strong: \\"We like them strong, but silent.\\" A rival for Trebor, these were very hot. Discontinued in the United Kingdom. * Ice: These came in a shiny blue wrapper, and had a cooler mint taste. * Paan flavoured (previously available in India). * Mint O Fruit: (available in Indonesia). These come in the following flavours: Raspberry Mint, Blackcurrant Mint, Peppermint, Lime Mint and Cherry Mint. These polos come with the following slogan \\"Think Plong! Masih Ada Bolong!\\" These are also sold in the United Kingdom in some Poundland stores. * Holes: These were a plastic tube of small mints approximately, but not exactly, the size of the hole in a standard Polo mint. Before this, Rowntree had already experimented with different Polos in the 1980s. Polo Fruits were always available, but they briefly made: * Lemon: Similar to the citrus flavour that Nestl√© put out around ten years later, but not identical. * Orange: similar to Lemon, but in an orange packet. * Tropical Fruit: included Banana, Melon, Coconut and others * Globes : small capsules filled with mint flavoured liquid in a small box with a flip lid  Description  Polo mints A Polo is approximately in diameter and thick, with a -wide hole. The original Polo is white in colour with a hole in the middle, and the word 'POLO' embossed twice on the upper flat side of the ring, hence the popular slogan The Mint with the Hole. Ingredients of the main variety include sugar, glucose syrup, modified starch, stearic acid (of vegetable origin), and mint oils.  Packaging  An open packet of Polo mints Polos are usually sold in individual packs of 23 mints, which measure about 10 cm tall. The tube of Polos is tightly wrapped with aluminium foil backed paper. A green and blue paper wrapper, with the word 'POLO', binds the foil wrapper, with the Os in 'Polo' represented by images of the sweet. For the spearmint flavour, the paper wrapper is turquoise in colour, and the Extra Strong flavour is in a black paper wrapper.  Trademarks  When the Trade Marks Act 1994 was introduced in the United Kingdom, Nestl√© applied to register the shape of the Polo mint. The application featured a white, annular mint without any lettering. This application however was opposed by Kraft Foods, the then owner of Life Savers, and Mars UK, because of the lack of distinctive character of the mint in question. Nestl√©'s application was allowed to proceed if it agreed to narrow the description of the mint i.e. the dimensions of the mint were limited to the standard dimensions of the Polo mint and that it was limited to 'mint flavoured compressed confectionery‚Äô. Kraft Foods and Swizzels Matlow (owner of British Navy Sweets) have made similar applications for annular sweets bearing the mark LIFESAVERS or NAVY. Nestl√© has tried to oppose these trademark applications but has failed as the court ruled that customers would be able to distinguish between a Polo, a Lifesaver and a British Navy mint as all of them have their marks boldly and prominently embossed on the mint.  Advertising  During the 1980s, Peter Sallis provided the voiceover for television advertisements. With the launch of the spearmint variety, a new television campaign featured a voiceover by Danny John-Jules, using a voice similar to the one he employed as the Cat on Red Dwarf. In 1995, the company launched a major advertising campaign produced by Aardman Animations, which showed animated Polos on a factory production line. In one, a scared Polo without a hole attempts to escape, but is restrained by the hole punching machinery. Polo experimented with other forms of advertising in the end of the 1990s. In 1998, they collaborated with PolyGram for a compilation album, Cool Grooves,http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/63830/Polo-sponsors-CD/ which reached No. 12 in the UK Compilation Chart on 5 September that year.

Although he read law at Exeter College, Oxford, and subsequently qualified as a barrister (called to the bar from Gray's Inn), he became involved in theatre at Oxford and joined British television at the founding of independent television in 1956, producing shows for ATV in Birmingham.  Career  Sherrin joined the BBC in 1957 as a temporary production assistant, then began working for them as a producer in \\"Television Talks\\" in 1963. Specialising in satirical shows, he worked extensively in film production and television. In 1962 he was responsible for the first satirical television series That Was The Week That Was starring David Frost and Millicent Martin and its successors Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life and BBC-3. His other shows and films included Up Pompeii!, Up the Front, The Cobblers of Umbridge and The Virgin Soldiers. In 1978, he also hosted We Interrupt This Week, a lively and humorous news events quiz featuring two teams of well-known journalists and columnists sparring against one another. The show was a production of WNET/Channel 13 New York. Sherrin produced and directed numerous theatre productions in London's West End, including Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell and the landmark musical revue Side by Side by Sondheim. He received an Olivier Award in 1984 for directing and conceiving The Ratepayers' Iolanthe, an adaptation by Sherrin and Alistair Beaton of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Iolanthe. On BBC Radio 4, from 1986, he presented a light entertainment show on Saturday mornings (latterly evenings) called Loose Ends, and Counterpoint, a quiz show about all types of music, until forced off the air when his voice succumbed to throat cancer. He also toured the UK with his one-man show An Evening of Theatrical Anecdotes. Sherrin wrote two volumes of autobiography, several books of quotations and anecdotes, as well as some fiction; and several works in collaboration with Caryl Brahms.

They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160‚Äì170 species. Bromus is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species. Within Pooideae, Bromus is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe). Bromus is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley) and Secale (rye).  Etymology  The generic name Bromus is derived from the Latin bromos, a borrowed word from the Ancient Greek (). and mean oats, but seems to have referred specifically to Avena sativa (Hippocrates On Regimen in Acute Diseases 2.43, Dioscorides Medicus 2.94, Polemo Historicus 88) and Avena barbata (Theophrastus Historia Plantarum 8.9.2, Pseudo-Dioscorides 4.137). The generic name comes from , a native Latin word for \\"oats\\" or \\"wild oats\\".  Description  Bromus species occur in many habitats in temperate regions of the world, including Africa, America, Australia and Eurasia. There are considerable morphological differences between some species, while the morphological differences between others (usually those species that are closely related) are subtle and difficult to distinguish. As such, the taxonomy of the genus is complicated. Bromus is distinguished from other grass genera by a combination of several morphological characteristics, including leaf sheaths that are closed (connate) for most of their length, awns that are usually inserted subapically, and hairy appendages on the ovary. The leaf blades and sheaths, which comprise the leaves can be hairless, sparsely hairy or hairy. The inflorescence is a dense or open panicle, usually drooping or nodding, sometimes spreading (as in Japanese brome, B. japonicus).  Ecology  The caterpillars of some Lepidoptera use Bromus as a foodplant, such as the chequered skipper (Carterocephalus palaemon).  Uses  Bromus species are generally considered to have little economic value to humans, at least in present times. Bromus mango was historically cultivated in Chile and Argentina by indigenous peoples, who used it both as fodder and food. The Tarahumara Indians in northern Mexico use the grains of some native Bromus species to aid fermentation in making one of their cultural beverages. As names like poverty brome (B. sterilis) and ripgut brome (B. diandrus) attest, some species are not very useful as fodder because their leaves sclerotize quickly and may even be harmful to livestock due to the high silica content. Others, such as meadow brome (Bromus riparius), native to parts of Russia, are planted as forage in the Great Plains of North America. Brome grasses are not usually grown as ornamental plants due to most species' nondescript appearance. Some are useful to prevent erosion but such use must be cautiously controlled as most Bromus have the ability to spread, becoming invasive weeds. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is a particularly troublesome weed across much of western North America (from southern British Columbia to California.)  Taxonomy and systematics  Taxonomists have generated various classification schemes to reflect the morphological variation that is seen in Bromus. In North America, five morphologically similar groups of species, called sections, are generally recognized: Bromus, Genea, Ceratochloa, Neobromus, and Bromopsis. Sections Bromus and Genea are native to the Old World (Eurasia), but many species are introduced into North America. Sections Bromopsis, Neobromus, and Ceratochloa have several native species in North America. = Selected species =  Gallery  Bromus inermis detail.jpegawnless brome (B. inermis) flowers Bromus kalmii.jpgArctic brome B. kalmii Bromus madritensis rubens in desert.jpgred brome B madritensis ssp. rubens Bromus sitchensis 2689.JPGAlaska brome B. rigidus Bromus secalinus2.jpgrye brome (B. secalinus) flowers Bromus sterilis.jpegbarren brome B. sterilis See also *List of Poaceae genera  References   External links  * Brome grasses UK * Interactive Key to Bromus of North America * Category:Poaceae genera Category:Grasses of Africa Category:Grasses of Asia Category:Grasses of Europe Category:Grasses of North America Category:Grasses of Oceania Category:Grasses of South America ","title":"Bromus"},{"id":"860937","text":"A person wearing a folded polo neck A polo neck, roll-neck (UK), turtleneck (US, Canada), or skivvy (Australia, New Zealand, US) is a garment--usually a sweater--with a close-fitting collar that folds over and covers the neck. It can also refer to the type of neckline, the style of collar itself, or be used as an adjective (\\"polo necked\\"). A simpler variant of the standard polo neck is the mock polo neck (or mock turtleneck), that resembles the polo neck with the soft fold at its top and the way it stands up around the neck, but both ends of the tube forming the collar are sewn to the neckline. This is mainly used to achieve the appearance of a polo neck where the fabric would fray, roll, or otherwise behave badly unless sewn. The mock polo neck clings to the neck smoothly, is easy to manufacture, and works well with a zip closure. History Woman in an unfolded polo neck. =Europe= Turtle neck-like garments have been worn for hundreds of years, dating at least to the 15th century. They were originally designed to protect the necks of knights wearing chainmail. Royalty adopted high-neck fashion, with the height and volume of the neck ruffly indicating status. From the late 19th century on, polo necks were commonly worn by menial workers, athletes, sailors and naval officers. Since the middle of the 20th century black polo necks have been closely associated with radical academics, philosophers, artists and intellectuals.Mary Ann Frese Witt, The Humanities: The humanities and the modern world, 2000, pages 463-464Deirdre Bair, Simone de Beauvoir:a biography, 1990, page 360 Also in the early 20th century, the polo neck shirt became a fashionable option for women with the rise of the Gibson Girl. The polo neck jumper became an iconic symbol of the French philosopher Michel Foucault. Polo necks also became a big fashion for young wealthy men after they were worn by European film stars Marcello Mastroianni and Yves Montand.Guido Vergani, Dizionario della moda, 2009, page 348 (in Italian) Greta Garbo often wore polo necks and trousers privately, as later Audrey Hepburn would do in official photographs. Vladimir PutinZbigniew Brzezinski, Putin's choice, 2008, of Russia and Andreas PapandreouTheodore C. Kariotis, The Greek socialist experiment: Papandreou's Greece 1981‚Äì1989, 1992 of Greece are two examples of European leaders fond of wearing polo necks. =United States= Their adoption by No√´l Coward in the 1920s turned polo necks into a brief middle- class fashion trend, and feminists made them into a unisex item. Absorbed into mainstream American fashion by the mid 20th century, the polo neck came to be viewed as an anti-tie, a smart form of dress for those who rejected formal wear. Senator Ted Kennedy, pianist/conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy, conductor Seiji Ozawa, philosopher Michel Foucault, shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos, singer Barry Manilow, scientist Carl Sagan, Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs were among those often seen in polo necks. Over time it became a fad among teenage girls, especially in a lightweight form that emphasised their figures. It was not long before Hollywood was also exploiting this image as part of the sweater girl look. By the late 1950s the \\"tight turtleneck\\" had been adopted as part of the preppy style among students, a style emphasising neatness, tidiness and grooming. This would become an important aspect of the polo neck's image in the United States. The look would filter through to Britain and the rest of Europe in a watered-down version. Very elegant polo necks of silk or nylon knit, especially made with French cuffs for formal dress affairs, have also seen success in American fashion. They have become iconic fashion choices for Steve Jobs and Elizabeth Holmes. As an alternative to the necktie Steve Jobs (left) wearing his signature mock polo neck by Issey Miyake Historically, polo necks were used as substitutes for a shirt-and-tie.

Singapore Management University (SMU) is the third autonomous university in Singapore. The university provides broad-based business programmes modelled after the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. SMU was established on 29 July 2000 and is located in the Downtown area of Singapore. It has a city campus with a total enrolment of about 10,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students and comprises six schools offering undergraduate, graduate and PhD programmes in business administration, business analytics, financial services, accountancy, economics, information systems management, law and the social sciences. The university has over 30 research institutes and centres of excellence, and customised corporate training and lifelong learning for individuals are available through the university's professional and executive development programmes. SMU is accredited by the AACSB International, EQUIS, and AMBA. History The former Raffles College, the site of SMU's first campus In 1997, the Singaporean government began considering setting up a third university in Singapore. Ho Kwon Ping, a Singaporean business entrepreneur, was appointed to chair the task-force which determined that the new institution would follow the American university system featuring a more flexible broad-based education. Following a review of undergraduate business schools to serve as a model for SMU, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania emerged as the best candidate. The Wharton-SMU agreement was signed in February 1999 followed in June by the Wharton-SMU Research Center collaboration. In July 1999, Janice Bellace, then Deputy Dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, commenced a two-year term as SMU's first president alongside founding provost, Tan Chin Tiong. In 2000, SMU made its first home at the former Raffles College (now the National University of Singapore's Bukit Timah campus) on Evans Road near Hwa Chong Institution. The campus, first opened in 1929, had already been home to several institutions before SMU. In 2001, SMU upgraded and occupied the main campus facilities, balancing the need to refit and refurbish it with facilities while preserving the heritage of colonial architecture. From 2001 to 2004, Ronald Frank served as SMU's second president and was succeeded by Howard Hunter. Between 2000 and 2005, SMU saw the formation of four schools, its library and three centres of excellence as well as the graduation of the first batch of its students. After that, SMU moved from its Bukit Timah campus to its current campus in the Bugis-Bras Basah district. Since then, SMU has expanded, with the establishment of its School of Law in 2007 and the restructuring of its School of Economics and Social Sciences into two separate schools: the School of Economics and the School of Social Sciences. In 2010, Yong Pung How and Arnoud De Meyer took over the positions of SMU Chancellor and President from Richard Hu and Howard Hunter respectively. and President In 2015, J. Y. Pillay replaced Yong as SMU's Chancellor while Lily Kong succeeded De Meyer as SMU's President in January 2019. Lim Chee Onn succeeded J. Y. Pillay as Chancellor in August that year.  Faculty  SMU has a 350-member faculty that includes industry experts and trainers. Academics SMU follows a course credit system similar to that used in most American universities. Each individual course within the university is assigned a certain credit weightage and students are usually required to take a specified number of units to fulfil requirements for graduation. Courses are typically conducted as small group seminars of under 50 students so as to allow for a high degree of interactive discourse between students and instructors. =Admissions= SMU admits students from a list of pre-university or high school qualifications that includes the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level, diplomas from the five polytechnics or two arts institutions and International Baccalaureate diploma once a year. For entry to graduate or master programmes, SMU requires GMAT and TOEFL or IELTS for most of the majors. Some majors also require submission of essays, recommendation letters, and a minimum of two years' work experience. =Second Majors= SMU offers 43 second majors to undergraduates. Upon completion, they receive one degree certificate and a second major will be indicated in the result transcript. =Double Degree= Undergraduates who are offered a double degree programme have 20 combinations to choose from. They can combine any of two disciplines: Accountancy, Business Management, Economics, Law, Information Systems Management or Social Sciences. Graduates will receive two degree certificates upon successful completion of the programme. Schools and programmes School of Accountancy Lee Kong Chian School of Business =School of Accountancy= The School of Accountancy (SOA) was launched in 2001 with the Bachelor of Accountancy (BAcc) undergraduate degree as its sole offering. In 2005, the school launched the Master of Professional Accounting (MPA) programme for professionals without undergraduate accounting qualifications. Both the SMU MPA and BAcc are accredited with the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA), Chartered Accountant of Singapore, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), CPA Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (ICAA) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). =Lee Kong Chian School of Business= The Lee Kong Chian School of Business (LKCSB) holds the status of being SMU's founding school, opening its doors to its pioneer batch of Bachelor of Business Management (BBM) students in August 2000. The school was named after the philanthropist Lee Kong Chian. The school offers the Master of Science in Applied Finance (China) programme, a collaborative effort between SMU and Wang Yanan Institute for the Study of Economics (WISE) at Xiamen University, and the Master of Science in Communication Management (MCM) in partnership with Universit√† della Svizzera italiana (USI) and with 10 days spent at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. The newest programme offering the Master of Human Capital Leadership (MHCL) has been accredited by Chartered Institute of Personnel & Development and the students visit the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for their overseas segment. The School also offers a PhD in Business Programme with concentration in Finance, Organisational Behaviour and Human Resources (OBHR), Marketing, Strategy & Organisation, Operations Management, or General Management,. =School of Economics= The School of Economics (SOE) was established in July 2002 as part of the then School of Economics and Social Sciences (SESS). Following restructuring, the university's economics faculty was separated from the social sciences to form a school of its own. This restructuring was largely accepted as a sound decision in view of the fact that SOE's curriculum had been modelled on that of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania instead of following the traditional social science-type economics curriculum found at most other institutions.The University of Pennsylvania offers two economics bachelor degrees. The BSc Economics is designed as a business-focused programme and is offered by the university's Wharton School while the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences offers the more traditional social science-focused economics programme. As of now, the SOE offers the Bachelor of Science (Economics) as well as Master of Science programmes in Economics and Applied Economics. In 2007, the School also introduced a PhD in Economics programme. =School of Information Systems= School of Information Systems The School of Information Systems (SIS) was formed with the aid of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) when SMU and CMU forged a four-year strategic partnership intended to use the expertise of the CMU faculty in the school's initial establishment. Through this partnership, CMU aided SIS in establishing and developing the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems Management undergraduate programme, including the establishment of the flagship SMU-CMU Fast-Track programme, which enables SIS students to graduate within four-and- a-half years with both a bachelor's degree from SMU and a master's degree from CMU. In 2007, both universities agreed upon a four-year extension with CMU now providing support in the establishment and growth of SIS's postgraduate education offerings. Under this agreement, the two universities also increased their focus on collaborative research efforts leading to joint faculty research outputs, funded projects and graduate student interaction. SIS offers the Master of Science in Information Systems, Master of IT in Business (MITB), as well as the PhD in Information Systems programmes, in addition to its Bachelor of Science undergraduate offering. The Master of IT in Business (MITB) augments its Analytics and Financial Services Analytics Tracks' offering with Harvard Business School's HBX Credential of Readiness (CORe) online programme. SMU is the first educational institution in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to incorporate HBX (CORe) into its master's programme. In 2018, SIS introduced the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, followed by the Bachelor of Science in Computing & Law in the year after. =School of Law= School of Law The School of Law (SOL) is SMU's smallest school with an annual intake of around 180 students. The establishment of the SOL was announced in August 2007. Previously, the SOL existed as the Department of Law under SMU's Lee Kong Chian School of Business, where it was chaired by Andrew Phang. Its current Dean is Goh Yihan, who succeeded Yeo Tiong Min in July 2017. The SOL offers the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) undergraduate programme, as well as an American-style Juris Doctor (JD) programme. The school also offers a Master of Laws (LLM) programme, with the option of a dual LLM with Queen Mary University of London. =School of Social Sciences= School of Economics and School of Social Sciences The School of Social Sciences (SOSS) was established in July 2002 as part of the then School of Economics and Social Sciences (SESS). Through a restructuring exercise in 2007, the School of Economics and School of Social Sciences were separated to form independent schools within SMU. The SOSS's primary offering is the Bachelor of Social Science, a multi-disciplinary undergraduate programme. Within this programme, three main majors are offered, namely political science, psychology and sociology. In addition, the SOSS offers a PhD in Psychology. A 2014 aerial panorama of the university (from left to right): School of Economics / School of Social Sciences, School of Information Systems, Li Ka Shing Library, School of Accountancy / School of Law, and Lee Kong Chian School of Business. =Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship= The Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship was established in 2009 and provides research, innovation and entrepreneurship training for the students of the university. In 2017, the institute launched Prot√©g√© Ventures, a student-run venture fund and training program. The institute organizes a major startup business competition called the Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition (LKYGBPC), which receives entries from a large number of international universities. In 2020, the competition received submissions from over 650 universities. = SMU Academy = SMU Academy offers programmes for working professionals, to provide continuous lifelong education through diplomas and certificate programs. This includes a combination of practical industry knowledge and general management skills. = Executive Development = In addition to its traditional academic programmes, the University also runs executive education and development programmes for leaders at four stages of their career: emerging leaders, general managers, senior executives and corporate directors. These courses include Executive Skills for Board Members in Challenging Times; SNEF-SMU CEO Seminars: The Art & Science of Productivity Leadership; and Johnson & Johnson-SMU Hospital Management.

SMU Libraries The SMU Libraries consists of the Li Ka Shing Library and the Kwa Geok Choo Law Library. =Institutional Knowledge (InK)= InK, Institutional Knowledge at SMU is the institutional repository and archives of the Singapore Management University. It acquires, organises and provides access to the research and scholarly works of SMU faculty. Collections in InK include journal articles, working papers, conference proceedings, books, book chapters, reports and other research works including the dissertations and theses of postgraduate students and a collection of print and video teaching cases. In addition, there are also the heritage and research data collections. Campus and facilities Li Ka Shing Library The campus has eight blocks: * Lee Kong Chian School of Business * School of Accountancy * Li Ka Shing Library * School of Information Systems * School of Economics / School of Social Sciences * School of Law & Kwa Geok Choo Law Library *SMU Connexion * Administration Building Six of the buildings are connected by an underground walkway known as the Concourse, which is open to the public and lined with shops. The campus was designed by two teams of architects, with Cox Architects and Planners and DEG Architects in charge of the Administrative Building, and Edward Cullinan Architects and KNTA Architects designing the rest. Teaching facilities include seminar rooms, classrooms, computer labs and group study rooms used by students for project discussions. There are research facilities scattered throughout the university. Sports facilities are limited on campus because of space constraints; however, the university has a swimming pool, gymnasium and a multi-purpose sports hall which is equipped with a rock wall. The University has campus-wide wireless LAN networks. The most recent building on campus is the School of Law, which officially opened in March 2017. A key feature integrated into the new building is the Kwa Geok Choo Law Library, named in memory of lawyer Kwa Geok Choo, who was also the wife of Singapore's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The 2,600 square-metre Kwa Geok Choo Law Library takes on a distinct architectural form that is reminiscent of a pearl. It seats more than 500 people and is fully equipped with modern technology. Within the School of Law building, there is the David Marshall Moot Court, the SMU Pro Bono Centre and other research centres. The university had leased the former MPH Building, which housed the former flagship store of MPH Group until 2003, located at the junction of Stamford Road and Armenian Street from mid 2015 to mid 2019 to house SMU Labs. This provided collaborative learning spaces for the university's latest learning experiment, known as SMU-X, in which lessons are centred on solving real-world problems through projects. The new SMU Connexion building, built to link the School of Law and School of Accountancy, opened in 2020 as a permanent home to SMU-X and SMU Labs. =Accommodation= The SMU Hostel, known as SMU Residences @ Prinsep, is located on Prinsep Street. The hostel was created by refurbishing three Housing Development Board blocks donated by the government. The hostel welcomed its first residents in December 2006 and was officially opened in February 2007. The hostel buildings can accommodate about 250 residents. Priority is given to international students, most of whom live in various private hostels around the island. In addition, the university leases rooms from a student hostel at Commonwealth Drive and these are open to 212 full- time SMU students (2nd year and above), exchange students and full-time postgraduate students who plan to study full-time at SMU for the forthcoming academic year. The hostel is located near Holland Village, which is known for its cosmopolitan array of restaurants and cafes. SMU also has 20 units in the Mount Sophia development which are available for rent and intended for faculty and staff and their family members, especially those relocating to Singapore from overseas or on visits of several months or more. Student life Students can take part in the school clubs and events, as well as organise school events. The academic year commences in late August. Each term is 15 weeks long, including a week-long mid-term break and another week of revision and exams. Term 1 generally runs from late August to early December, while Term 2 begins in January and ends in mid-April. In most courses, students are assessed on the level of their class participation, a group project, a midterm test, and possibly, an exam at the end of the term. Students are generally required to give a presentation on a project topic for every course they read. Attending a half-unit course, called Finishing Touch, which advises students on career skills is also mandatory. It is part of each student's curriculum to spend at least 10 weeks on an internship at an approved organisation, and 80 hours of community service. These occupy the summer holidays of most students. Students are also encouraged to go an international exchange term with partner universities to experience different cultures. SMU has around 220 agreements with partner universities from 48 countries.

Landau, \\"Radical Politics in Modern Turkey\\", BRILL, 1974.Robert F. Melson, \\"The Armenian Genocide\\" in Kevin Reilly (Editor), Stephen Kaufman (Editor), Angela Bodino (Editor) \\"Racism: A Global Reader (Sources and Studies in World History)\\", M.E. Sharpe (January 2003). pg 278:\\"Concluding that their liberal experiment had been a failure, CUP leaders turned to Pan-Turkism, a xenophobic and chauvinistic brand of nationalism that sought to create a new empire based on Islam and Turkish ethnicity.\\" Turanism is a closely related movement but a more general term than Turkism, since Turkism applies only to Turkic peoples. However, researchers and politicians steeped in Turkic ideology have used these terms interchangeably in many sources and works of literature.Iskander Gilyazov, \\"–ü–∞–Ω—Ç—é—ÄŒ∫–∏–∑–º, –ü–∞–Ω—Ç—É—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º –∏ –ì–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∏—è \\", magazine \\"–¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω\\" No 5-6, 1995. Although many of the Turkic peoples share historical, cultural and linguistic roots, the rise of a pan-Turkic political movement is a phenomenon of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was in part a response to the development of Pan-Slavism and Pan-Germanism in Europe, and influenced Pan-Iranism in Asia. Ziya G√∂kalp defined pan-Turkism as a cultural, academic, and philosophical and political concept advocating the unity of Turkic peoples. Name In research literature, \\"pan-Turkism\\" is used to describe the political, cultural and ethnic unity of all Turkic-speaking people. \\"Turkism\\" began to be used with the prefix \\"pan-\\" (from the Greek œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ, pan = all).Mansur Hasanov, Academician of Academy of Sciences of Tatarstan Republic, \\"–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π —Ä–µ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ç–æ—Ä\\", in magazine \\"–†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω\\" ‚Ññ 96‚Äì97 (24393-24394), 17 May 2001. Proponents use the latter as a point of comparison, since \\"Turkic\\" is more a linguistic and cultural distinction than a racial or ethnic description. This differentiates it from \\"Turkish\\", which is an ethnic term for people primarily residing in Turkey. Pan-Turkic ideas and reunification movements have been popular since the collapse of the Soviet Union in Central Asian and other Turkic countries. History Pan-Turkic rally in Istanbul, March 2009 In 1804, the Tatar theologian Ghabdennasir Qursawi wrote a treatise calling for the modernization of Islam. Qursawi was a Jadid (from the Arabic jadid, \\"new\\"). The Jadids encouraged critical thinking, supporting education and the equality of the sexes, and advocated tolerance for other faiths, Turkic cultural unity, and openness to Europe‚Äôs cultural legacy.Rafael Khakimov, \\"Taklid and Ijtihad \\", Russia in Global Affairs, Dec. 2003. The Jadid movement was founded in 1843 in Kazan. Its aim was a semi-secular modernization and educational reform, with a national (not religious) identity for the Turks. Before that they were Muslim subjects of the Russian Empire, which maintained this attitude until its end.N.N., \\"–ü–æ–ª—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –í–µ–∫–∞ –ü–∞–Ω—Ç—é—ÄŒ∫–∏–∑–º–∞ –≤ –¢—É—Ä—Ü–∏–∏\\", magazine \\"–ü–∞–Ω–æ—Ä–∞–º–∞\\". After the W√§isi movement, the Jadids advocated national liberation. After 1907, many supporters of Turkic unity immigrated to the Ottoman Empire. The newspaper T√ºrk in Cairo was published by exiles from the Ottoman Empire after the suspension of the 1876 constitution and the persecution of liberal intellectuals. It was the first publication to use the ethnic designation as its title. Yusuf Ak√ßura published \\"Three Types of Policy\\" (√ú√ß tarz-ƒ± siyaset) anonymously in 1904, the earliest manifesto of a pan-Turkic nationalism. Ak√ßura argued that the supra-ethnic union espoused by the Ottomans was unrealistic. The Pan-Islamic model had advantages, but Muslim populations were under colonial rule which would oppose unification. He concluded that an ethnic Turkish nation would require the cultivation of a national identity; a pan-Turkish empire would abandon the Balkans and Eastern Europe in favor of Central Asia. The first publication of \\"Three Types of Policy\\" had a negative reaction, but it became more influential by its third publication in 1911 in Istanbul. The Ottoman Empire had lost its African territory to Italy and it would soon lose the Balkans, and pan-Turkish nationalism became a more feasible (and popular) political strategy. In 1908 the Committee of Union and Progress came to power in Ottoman Turkey, and the empire adopted a nationalistic ideology. This contrasted with its largely Muslim ideology dating back to the 16th century, when the sultan was a caliph of his Muslim lands. Leaders espousing Pan-Turkism fled from Russia to Istanbul, where a strong pan-Turkic movement arose; the Turkish pan-Turkic movement grew into a nationalistic, ethnically oriented replacement of the caliphate with a state. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire with its multi- cultural and multi-ethnic population, influenced by the nationalism of the Young Turks, some tried to replace the empire with a Turkish commonwealth. Leaders like Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk acknowledged that such a goal was impossible, replacing pan-Turkic idealism with a nationalism aimed at preserving an Anatolian nucleus. The T√ºrk Yurdu Dergisi (Journal of the Turkish Homeland) was founded in 1911 by Ak√ßura. This was the most important Turkist publication of the time, \\"in which, along with other Turkic exiles from Russia, [Ak√ßura] attempted to instill a consciousness about the cultural unity of all Turkic peoples of the world.\\" A significant early exponent of pan-Turkism was Enver Pasha (1881‚Äì1922), the Ottoman Minister of War and acting commander-in-chief during World War I. He later became a leader of the Basmachi movement (1916‚Äì1934) against Russian and Soviet rule in Central Asia. During World War II, the Nazis organized a Turkestan legion composed primarily of soldiers who hoped to develop an independent Central Asian state after the war. The German intrigue bore no fruit. Interest in Pan-Turkism declined, however, with the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923 under leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, with Atat√ºrk generally favoring Ziya G√∂kalp over Enver Pasha.Pan Turkism, Encyclopedia Britannica. Pan-Turkist movements gained some momentum in the 1940s, due to support of Nazi Germany who in the course of the war, sought to leverage Pan-Turkism to undermine Russian influence and in an effort to reach resources of Central Asia. The development of pan-Turkist and anti-Soviet ideology, in some circles, was influenced by Nazi propaganda during this period.Jacob M. Landau, \\"Radical Politics in Modern Turkey\\", BRILL, 1974. pg 194: \\"In the course of the Second World War, various circles in Turkey absorbed Nazi propaganda; these were pro- German and admired Nazism, which they grasped as a doctrine of warlike dynamism and a source of national inspiration, on which they could base their pan-Turkic and anti-Soviet ideology\\"John M. VanderLippe , \\"The politics of Turkish democracy\\", SUNY Press, 2005. \\"A third group was led by Nihal Atsiz, who favored a Hitler style haircut and mustache, and advocated racist Nazi doctrines\\" Some sources claim that Nihal Atsƒ±z advocated Nazi doctrines and adopted a Hitler-style haircut and mustache.John M.

The Turco-Tatars in Romania cooperated with the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist organisation. Although Turkish government archives for the World War II years have not been released, the level of contact can be ascertained from German archives. A ten-year Turco-German treaty of friendship was signed in Ankara on 18 January 1941. Official and semi-official meetings between German ambassador Franz von Papen and other German officials and Turkish officials, including General H. E. Erkilet (of Tatar origin and a frequent contributor to pan-Turkic journals) took place in the second half of 1941 and the early months of 1942. The Turkish officials included General Ali Fuad Erdem and Nuri Pasha, brother of Enver Pasha. Pan- Turkists were not supported by the government during this time and on 19 May 1944 ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º gave a speech condemning Pan-Turkism as \\"a dangerous and sick demonstration of the latest times\\" going on to say the Turkish Republic was \\"facing efforts hostile to the existence of the Republic\\" and those advocating for these ideas \\"will bring only trouble and disaster\\". Nihal Atsiz and other prominent pan-Turkist leaders were tried and sentenced to prison for conspiring against the government. Zeki Velidi Togan was sentenced to 10 years and 4 years of internal exile, Reha Oƒüuz T√ºrkkan received 2 years and Nihal Atsiz received a four years in prison and 3 year in exile sentence. Others were condemned to more lenient sentences of a few months to a year. But the defendants appealed the convictions and in October 1945, the sentences of all the convicted were abolished by the Military Court of Cassation. While Erkilet discussed military contingencies, Nuri Pasha told the Germans about his plan to create independent states which would be allies (not satellites) of Turkey. These states would be formed from the Turkic-speaking populations in Crimea, Azerbaijan, Central Asia, northwest Iran, and northern Iraq. Nuri Pasha offered to assist propaganda activities for this cause. However, Turkey also feared for the Turkic minorities in the USSR and told von Papen that it could not join Germany until the USSR was crushed. The Turkish government may have been apprehensive about Soviet might, which kept the country out of the war. On a less-official level, Turkic emigrants from the Soviet Union played a crucial role in negotiations and contacts between Turkey and Germany; among them were prominent pan-Turkic activists like Zeki Velidi Togan, Mammed Amin Rasulzade, Mirza Bala, Ahmet Caferoƒùlu, Sayid Shamil and Ayaz ƒ∞shaki. Several Tatar military units of Turkic speakers in the Turco-Tatar and Caucasian regions who had been prisoners of war joined the war against the USSR, generally fighting as guerrillas in the hope of independence and a pan-Turkic union. The units, which were reinforced, numbered several hundred thousand. Turkey took a cautious approach at the government level, but pan-Turkist groups were exasperated by Turkish inaction and what they saw as the waste of a golden opportunity to reach the goals of pan-Turkism. After the late-20th- century collapse of the Soviet Union, the Turkic peoples were more independent in business and politics: Pan-Turkic movements and organizations are focusing on the economic integration of the sovereign Turkic states and hope to form an economic and political union similar to the European Union. Turkey's role Turkey's efforts have not met the expectations of the Turkic states or the country's pan-Turkist supporters. Modest housing projects promised to the Crimean Tatars have not been completed after many years. Some language communities have switched to the Latin alphabet, but the official Turkmen, Uzbek and Azerbaijani Latin alphabets are not as compatible with the Turkish alphabet as Turkey had hoped after a Pan-Turkic Alphabet with 35 letters had been agreed upon in the early 1990s prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Kazakh alphabets already include Latin ones, and Kazakhstan is planned to be fully converted to the Latin alphabet by 2025. Kyrgyzstan has not seriously considered adopting the Latin script, but the idea was entertained by some politicians during the country's first few years of independence, and Roman Kyrgyz alphabets exist. Criticism Pan-Turkism is often perceived as a new form of Turkish imperial ambition. Some view the Young Turk leaders who saw pan-Turkist ideology as a way to reclaim the prestige of the Ottoman Empire as racist and chauvinistic.Jacob M. Landau. Pan-Turkism: From Irredentism to Cooperation. India University Press, 1995. 2nd Edition. pg 45: \\"Pan-Turkism's historic chance arrived shortly before and during First World War, when it was adopted a guiding principle of state policy by an influential group among the Young Turks\\"Robert F. Melson, \\"The Armenian Genocide\\" in Kevin Reilly (Editor), Stephen Kaufman (Editor), Angela Bodino (Editor) \\"Racism: A Global Reader (Sources and Studies in World History)\\", M.E. Sharpe (January 2003). pg 278: \\"Concluding that their liberal experiment had been a failure, CUP leaders turned to Pan-Turkism, a xenophobic and chauvinistic brand of nationalism that sought to create a new empire based on Islam and Turkish ethnicity ... It was in this context of revolutionary and ideological transformation and war that the fateful decision to destroy the Armenians was taken.\\" Armenian history Clive Foss, professor of ancient history at the University of Massachusetts Boston, has done extensive archeological work in Turkey and he is an expert on ancient Armenian coins. In his article, \\"The Turkish View of Armenian History: A Vanishing Nation\\", Foss writes that the Turkish government was \\"systematically changing the names of villages to make them more Turkish. Any name which does not have a meaning in Turkish, or does not sound Turkish, whatever its origin, is replaced by a banal name assigned by a bureau in Ankara, with no respect for local conditions or traditions\\".Clive Foss, ‚ÄúThe Turkish View of Armenian History: A Vanishing Nation,‚Äù in The Armenian Genocide: History, Politics, Ethics, ed. by Richard G. Hovannisian (New York: St. Martins Press, 1992), p. 268. According to Foss, the Turkish government \\"presented [Armenia] ambiguously, without clear identification of [its] builders, or as examples of the influence of the superiority of Turkish architecture. In all this, a clear line is evident: the Armenian presence is to be consigned, as far as possible, to oblivion\\". Foss notes critically that in 1982: The Armenian File in the Light of History, Cemal Anadol writes that the Iranian Scythians and Parthians are Turks. According to 'genius' Anadol, the Armenians welcomed the Turks into the region; their language is a mixture with no roots and their alphabet is mixed, with 11 characters borrowed from the ancient Turkic alphabet. Foss calls this view historical revisionism: \\"Turkish writings have been tendentious: history has been viewed as performing a useful service, proving or supporting a point of view, and so it is treated as something flexible which can be manipulated at will\\". He concludes, \\"The notion, which seems well established in Turkey, that the Armenians were a wandering tribe without a home, who never had a state of their own, is of course entirely without any foundation in fact. The logical consequence of the commonly expressed view of the Armenians is that they have no place in Turkey, and never did. The result would be the same if the viewpoint were expressed first, and the history written to order. In a sense, something like this seems to have happened, for most Turks who grew up under the Republic were educated to believe in the ultimate priority of Turks in all parts of history, and to ignore Armenians all together; they had been clearly consigned to oblivion.\\" Western Azerbaijan is a term used in Azerbaijan to refer to Armenia. According to the Whole Azerbaijan theory, modern Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh were once inhabited by the Azerbaijanis. Its claims are based on the belief that current Armenia was ruled by Turkic tribes and states from the Late Middle Ages to the Treaty of Turkmenchay which was signed after the Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828. The concept has been sanctioned by the government of Azerbaijan and its current president, Ilham Aliyev, who has said that Armenia is part of ancient Turkic, Azerbaijani land. Turkish and Azerbaijani historians have said that Armenians are alien, not indigenous, in the Caucasus and Anatolia.Tofig Kocharli \\"Armenian Deception\\"Ohannes Geukjian \\"Ethnicity, Nationalism and Conflict in the South Caucasus: Nagorno-Karabakh and the Legacy of Soviet Nationalities Policy\\" Russian views In Tsarist Russian circles, pan-Turkism was considered a political, irredentist and aggressive idea. Turkic peoples in Russia were threatened by Turkish expansion, and I. Gasprinsky and his followers were accused of being Turkish spies. After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks‚Äô attitude to T√ºrkism did not differ from the Russian Empire‚Äôs. At the 10th Congress of Bolshevik Communist Party in 1921, the party \\"condemned pan- Turkism as a slope to bourgeois-democratic nationalism\\". The emergence of a pan-Turkism scare in Soviet propaganda made it one of the most frightening political labels in the USSR. The most widespread accusation used in the lethal repression of educated Tatars and other Turkic peoples during the 1930s was that of pan-Turkism.Mansur Hasanov, Academician of Academy of Sciences of Tatarstan republic, in \\"People's Political Newspaper\\" ‚Ññ 96‚Äì97 (24393-24394) 17 May 2001 http://www.rt-online.ru/numbers/public/?ID=25970 Russia, China, and Iran say that they perceive pan-Turkism as a new form of Turkish imperial ambition, and some see it as racist. Critics believe that the concept is flawed because of the distinct dialects spoken by the Turkic peoples, which sometimes led to miscommunication. Concerns also exist about religious differences. Although most Turks are Sunnis, there are also predominantly Shi'i peoples (like Azerbaijanis) and predominantly Christian peoples (like Chuvash or Yakuts). According to some, mostly critics from Iran, pan-Turkists are at the forefront of historical revisionism about world history in general and Turkic history in particular.Pan-Turanianism Takes Aim at Azerbaijan: A Geopolitical Agenda By: Dr. Kaveh Farrokh Pseudoscientific theories Pan- Turkism has been characterized by pseudoscientific theories known as Pseudo- Turkology. Though dismissed in serious scholarship, scholars promoting such theories, often known as Pseudo-Turkologists, have in recent times emerged among every Turkic nationality. A leading light among them is Murad Adzhi, who insists that two hundred thousand years ago, \\"an advanced people of Turkic blood\\" were living in the Altai Mountains. These tall and blonde Turks are supposed to have founded the world's first state, Idel-Ural, 35,000 years ago, and to have migrated as far as the Americas. According to theories like the Turkish History Thesis, promoted by pseudo-scholars, the Turkic peoples are supposed to have migrated from Central Asia to the Middle East in the Neolithic. The Hittites, Sumerians, the Babylonians and ancient Egyptians, are here classified as being of Turkic origin. The Kurgan cultures of the early Bronze Age up to more recent times, are also typically ascribed to Turkic peoples by pan-Turkic pseudoscholars, such as Ismail Miziev. Non-Turkic peoples typically classified as Turkic, Turkish, Proto-Turkish or Turanian, include Scythians, Sakas, Cimmerians, Medes, Parthians, Pannonian Avars, Caucasian Albania and various ethnic minorities in Turkic countries, such as Kurds. Adzhi also considers Alans, Goths, Burgundians, Saxons, Alemanni, Angles, Lombards and many Russians as Turks. Only a few prominent peoples in history, such as Jews, Chinese people, Armenians, Greeks, Persians and Scandinavians are considered non-Turkic by Adzhi. Philologist Mirfatyh Zakiev, former Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar ASSR, has published hundreds of \\"scientific\\" works on the subject, suggesting Turkic origins of Sumerian, Greek, Icelandic, Etruscan and Minoan. Zakiev contends that \\"proto- Turkish is the starting point of the Indo-European languages\\". Not only peoples and cultures, but also prominent individuals, such as Saint George, Peter the Great, Mikhail Kutuzov and Fyodor Dostoevsky are proclaimed to have been \\"of Turkic origin\\". As such the Turkic peoples are supposed to have once been the \\"benevolent conquerors\\" of the peoples of most of Eurasia, who thus owe them \\"a huge cultural debt\\". Philip L. Kohl notes that the above-mentioned theories are nothing more than \\"incredible myths\\". Nevertheless, the promotion of these theories have \\"taken on large-scale proportions\\" in countries such as Turkey and Azerbaijan. Often associated with Greek, Assyrian and Armenian Genocide denial, pan-Turkic pseudoscience has received extensive state and state-backed non-governmental support, and is taught all the way from elementary school to the highest level of universities in such countries. Turkish students are imbued with textbooks making \\"absurdly inflated\\" claims that all Eurasian nomads, including the Scythians, and all civilizations on the territory of the Ottoman Empire, such as Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece and the Byzantine Empire, were of Turkic origin. Konstantin Sheiko and Stephen Brown explains the reemergence of such pseudo-history as a form of national therapy, helping its proponents cope with the failures of the past.

A regular contributor to the CBS program The NFL Today, Snyder predicted the scores of NFL games, which sports bettors used to figure out the point spread. Due to comments he made about breeding practices during slavery leading to blacks becoming superior athletes, CBS fired him in January 1988. Early life and career Snyder was born in Steubenville, Ohio. According to his New York Times obituary of April 22, 1996, Snyder's family roots were in the village of Tholopotami (ŒòŒøŒªoœÄŒøœÑŒ¨ŒºŒπ), on the island of Chios in the Aegean Sea. As a teenager in Ohio, he became acquainted with bookmakers. According to his autobiography Jimmy the Greek, Snyder bet $10,000 on the 1948 election between Thomas Dewey and Harry S. Truman, getting 17‚Äì1 odds for Truman to win. In a later interview he indicated that he knew Truman was going to win because Dewey had a mustache and \\"American women didn't trust men with a mustache\\". He invested money in oil drilling and coal mining, but when those ventures failed, Snyder moved to Las Vegas in 1956 and began a weekly pro football betting line. The NFL Today The sports line eventually led to a 12-year stint on the CBS Sunday morning show, The NFL Today, a pregame show for National Football League (NFL) games. Known simply as \\"Jimmy the Greek,\\" he would appear in segments with sportscaster Brent Musburger and predict the results of that week's NFL games. While already famous in gambling circles, his rough charm made him into a minor celebrity. He had conflicts with Musburger (whom he once punched in the face at a bar when the show anchor insulted his intelligence) and Phyllis George (whom he once brought to tears before a show by making a comment about her husband, leading to Jimmy taping his segments with Musburger in advance so that he and George were not on the set at the same time). As sports betting was illegal in most of the United States, and was at the time a general social taboo, his segment would not overtly mention betting or gambling. Instead, Jimmy the Greek would predict the score of each game; for example, he would say the Los Angeles Raiders would beat the Los Angeles Rams 31-21. This allowed bettors who knew the line of the game to be able to deduce his selection when betting the point spread: If the spread in the example game was the Raiders by five, bettors would know Jimmy was picking the Raiders to beat it. The NFL was adamant about avoiding any official connections between gambling and the league, but NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle was an acquaintance of Jimmy and made it clear that his work on CBS was acceptable. =Racial comments and dismissal = On January 16, 1988, Snyder was fired by the CBS network (where he had been a regular on NFL Today since 1976) after making several questionable comments about African Americans during a lunchtime interview on January 15, 1988 with Ed Hotaling, a producer-reporter for NBC- owned WRC-TV, at Duke Zeibert's Washington, D.C. restaurant. Hotaling said that he had been doing interviews with various people in the restaurant for a program celebrating the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. and what they thought the next step in civil rights progress for African Americans should be. He put the question to Snyder. \\"It was all on the occasion of Martin Luther King's birthday,\\" Hotaling said. \\"So I thought it was an appropriate, forward-looking question, and got a backward-looking answer.\\" One of Snyder's more controversial responses to the question was that African Americans were naturally-superior athletes at least in part because they had been bred to produce stronger offspring during slavery: According to the New York Times obituary, Snyder expressed regret for his comments: \\"What a foolish thing to say.\\" His CBS coworkers publicly stated that they did not agree with Snyder's theories and that they did not oppose CBS's decision to fire him. Black former NFL player Irv Cross said in the 30 for 30 documentary about Snyder that he had worked alongside Snyder for a long time and did not consider him to be a racist at all. In the same documentary, Frank Deford sympathetically noted that Jimmy often tried to sound more educated than he actually was and that his comments were basically him trying to make a point about a subject on which he knew nothing. In the same WRC-TV interview, Snyder, whose remarks were termed \\"reprehensible\\" by CBS, also commented that the only sports realm in which whites then dominated was coaching and that if blacks were to \\"take coaching, as I think everyone wants them to, there is not going to be anything left for the white people.\\" Snyder, during his remarks, emphasized he was not meaning to be \\"derogatory\\" but said the only thing then that \\"whites control are the coaching jobs ‚Äî the black talent is beautiful, it's great, it's out there. The only thing left for the whites is a couple of coaching jobs.\\"Wilmington Morning Star, Jimmy 'The Greek\\" Dies of Heart Failure, p. 5C In 1991, Snyder sued the CBS network for age discrimination, defamation, and breach of contract.The Milwaukee Sentinel, Jimmy the Greek sues over firing, Part 1, Page 3 Snyder maintained that his firing aggravated his personal health problems, according to court papers. Snyder's attorney, Jeffery L. Liddle, stated that by \\"firing and repudiating Mr. Snyder, CBS quashed his dream, his dignity, and his spirit.\\" Snyder lost the case. In popular culture Snyder appeared in a cameo in the 1981 comedy film The Cannonball Run as a bookie. In the movie, he offered 50‚Äì1 odds against Formula One driver Jamie Blake (played by Dean Martin) and gambler Morris Fenderbaum (played by Sammy Davis Jr.) winning the Cannonball coast-to-coast endurance race. Snyder and Dean Martin were childhood acquaintances in Steubenville, Ohio. On November 10, 2009, ESPN aired a show in their 30 for 30 series titled The Legend of Jimmy the Greek, which was produced by Fritz Mitchell. Commentary was provided by, among others, Brent Musburger, Irv Cross and Phyllis George from The NFL Today, plus Anthony Snyder (Jimmy's son), as well as his brother Johnny and sister Angie. The show also acknowledges his role in the first sportscasts of poker tournaments. Although Snyder was largely unknown outside of the United States, in 1974, his name achieved international renown. After beating George Foreman to regain the world heavyweight championship, Muhammad Ali, in the midst of an interview with David Frost, looked into the camera and addressed his doubters. \\"All of you bow\\" he said. \\"All of my critics crawl... All of you suckers bow... If you wanna know any damn thing about boxing, don't go to no boxing experts in Las Vegas, don't go to no Jimmy the Greek. Come to Muhammad Ali.\\" He was parodied in sketches on Saturday Night Live and Second City Television, portrayed on the respective programs by Phil Hartman and John Candy. Snyder is also parodied in an episode of The Simpsons titled \\"Lisa the Greek\\", which was named after him. A character modeled after him named \\"Smooth\\" Jimmy Apollo (once again played by Phil Hartman) is featured in the episode giving dubious predictions about football games. Snyder was referenced in an episode of The Golden Girls titled \\"And Ma Makes Three.\\" Rose asks Dorothy if she is really going to dump her mother in order to spend alone time with her boyfriend, Dorothy responds with \\"Faster than CBS dumped Jimmy the Greek.\\" Personal life Snyder and his wife Joan lost three of their five children to cystic fibrosis.Jimmy the Greek faces his longest odds in a family fight for life; People, 26 October 1981 Snyder suffered from diabetes in his later years and died of a heart attack on April 21, 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the age of 77. He was buried at Union Cemetery in his native Steubenville.

He captained the international side in 31 of his 39 Test matches, winning 17 and losing only 4. He was the President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 2007‚Äì08. Since his retirement from professional cricket he has pursued a career as a writer and psychoanalyst, serving as President of the British Psychoanalytical Society 2008‚Äì10. He is married to Mana Sarabhai who is from India and they have two children together. Early life Brearley was educated at the City of London School (where his father Horace, himself a first-class cricketer, was a master). While at St. John's College, Cambridge, Brearley excelled at cricket (he was then a wicketkeeper/batsman). After making 76 on his first-class debut as a wicketkeeper, he played for Cambridge University between 1961 and 1968 (captaining the side from 1964 onwards), first as an undergraduate in the Classical and Moral Sciences tripos, and then as a postgraduate. While still at Cambridge, he was chosen for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to South Africa in 1964‚Äì65, and to captain the MCC Under-25 side in Pakistan in 1966‚Äì67, where he scored 312 not out against North Zone (his highest first-class score) and 223 against the Pakistan Under-25 side he ended the tour with 793 runs from six matches at an average of 132. County cricket From 1961 onwards, he played for Middlesex County Cricket Club, often opening the innings with Michael Smith. As captain between 1971 and 1982, he led Middlesex to County Championships in 1976, 1977 (jointly with Kent), 1980 and 1982; and he appeared in Free Foresters' very last first- class fixture, in 1968, keeping wicket and scoring 91. International cricket In part because of his pursuit of an academic career as a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which limited his cricketing activity in 1969 and 1970, Brearley was not selected for England until the age of 34 in 1976. His record in Test cricket as a batsman was modest (he averaged 22.88 in 66 Test innings, without a century), but he was an outstanding captain. Having previously kept wicket, he was also a fine slip catcher, usually at first slip. He took over as captain of England in 1977. His management skills (he was once described by Rodney Hogg as having \\"a degree in people\\") drew the best from the players in his team, although he was fortunate to be able to call on the services of Bob Willis, David Gower and Ian Botham at their peak. Brearley was captain during the infamous aluminium bat incident in 1979, when he objected to Dennis Lillee's use of a metal bat instead of one made of willow. On the same tour, he caused controversy by ordering all his fielders, including the wicketkeeper, to the boundary with three runs required off the last ball of the match (this was legal by the rules of the time). He had been an innovator regarding cricket equipment himself, wearing a 'skull cap' under his England cap in 1977 (in the days before players wore helmets). It consisted of a plastic protector with two side pieces protecting his temples. It was later popularised by the Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar. Brearley captained England to the final of the 1979 Cricket World Cup, scoring 53 in the semi-final against New Zealand and 64 in the final against the West Indies. However, his opening partnership of 129 with Geoff Boycott in the final used up 38 of 60 allotted overs; although it was recognised that a potent pace attack of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft and Joel Garner needed to be countered, the speed of the partnership greatly added to the pressure on the rest of the order. Garner bowled a spell of 5 wickets for 4 runs to induce a drastic collapse and hand the West Indies the match and the World Cup by 92 runs. Having passed the England captaincy to Ian Botham in 1980 (losing his Test place in the process), Brearley returned as captain following Botham's resignation for the third Test against Australia at Headingley in 1981, going on to win the match and two of the remaining three matches of the series to win the Ashes 3‚Äì1. His leadership benefited from Botham's recovered form following his winless captaincy record and his nosedive in form (he had made a pair in the second Test at Lord's) to take a first-innings 6 for 95 and score 50 and 149 not out in the third Test at Headingley, bowl a spell of 5 wickets for 1 run in the fourth Test at Edgbaston, score 118 from 102 balls in the fifth Test at Old Trafford, and take a 10-wicket match haul (6 for 125 and 4 for 128) in the sixth Test at the Oval. Post-cricket career Brearley opposed sporting links with apartheid South Africa, seconding a motion to the MCC in 1968 calling for the cessation of tours until there was actual progress towards non-racial cricket. He seconded the motion from David Sheppard to the MCC, calling for the England tour to South Africa to be cancelled, and was a supporter of John Arlott who campaigned in The Guardian for the same objective. He is now a psychoanalyst, psychotherapist (registered with the BPC), motivational speaker, and part-time cricket journalist for The Times.

In the , Sandgate had a population of 4,909 people. The town became a popular escape for the people of Brisbane in the early 20th century. The suburb is a popular destination within Brisbane due to its coastline, Lovers Walk along the coast between Sandgate and neighbouring Shorncliffe and Moora Park and Beach. Geography Sandgate is situated on the coastline, along Bramble Bay part of Moreton Bay. The western border of the suburb is marked by the Gateway Motorway. The Shorncliffe railway line (part of the Queensland Rail City network) enters the suburb from the south-west (Deagon) and exits to the south (Shorncliffe) with Sandgate railway station in Chubb Street off Rainbow Street () serving the suburb. The Deagon Wetlands are in the west of the suburb (); they are part of the North East Wetlands of Brisbane. Dowse Lagoon is in the centre of the suburb (). It was officially named on 15 November 1975 after Thomas Dowse who settled in the Sandgate area in 1853. Einbunpin Lagoon is a smaller lagoon to the south-east of Dowse Lagoon (). History The Turrbul people inhabited the seashore, the creeks and lagoons from Nudgee Beach to the Pine River. They were a branch of the clan of the Yugarabul speaking people. This larger clan inhabited the area from North Brisbane and along the coastline of Nudgee, Sandgate to Caboolture. In their language the local Turrbal clan called their coastal land \\"Warra\\" meaning \\"an open sheet of water\\". This land is now calle Shorncliffe, Sandgate and Brighton. Their existence depended upon their knowledge of the seasons and their surroundings. Spears, nullas and boomerangs were used in hunting and woven nets for fishing. The British settlers originally called the area Cabbage Tree Creek (after the creek). The town was named Sandgate by James Burnett, an early surveyor in the region after the seaside town of Sandgate in Kent, England. Sandgate in Kent had a military camp, Shorncliffe Camp, on top of the cliffs adjacent to it. Sandgate in Brisbane has an adjacent suburb called Shorncliffe named after the camp in Kent, again by Burnett, after the similarity of the cliffs. Land in Sandgate became available in 1853, allowing a small seaside settlement to develop. One of the first structures built at Sandgate was a Native Police barracks, from where officers such as the Frederick Wheeler conducted punitive raids against local aboriginals. On 25 May 1872, Robert Travers Atkin, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, died at Sandgate following an illness of some months. At his request, At his request, he was buried in Sandgate on the crest of the rise on which he had enjoyed sitting under the shade of the trees and looking out onto Moreton Bay. His will provided ¬£50 to build a church beside his grave. This church was the first St Margaret's church (and is now used as the rectory). A monument was erected to his memory by the members of the Hibernian Society of Queensland, of which he was vice-president. In August 1873, a public meeting was held to establish a school. There were about 50 school-age children in Sandgate and nearly ¬£70 was donated towards the establishment of a school. Sandgate State School opened on 15 September 1873 under teacher William R. Barfoot in the chapel of the first Baptist Church in Loudon Street (not to be confused with the Sandgate Baptist Church in Flinders Street which opened in 1887). The first permanent school building opened in 1874.alt=Sandgate Fire Brigade outside the fire station in 1923 By 1874, coach services connected Sandgate to Brisbane. In December 1879, allotments in the Town of Sandgate were auctioned by John Cameron. A map advertising the auction states the land available was subdivisions 1 to 14, of allotments 8, 9, 10 and part of 7, Sec. 3, Town of Sandgate. The map shows allotments bordered by Friday, Yundah and Kate Streets, now in Shorncliffe. In January 1880, a plan of subdivisions 1 to 32 of Portion 73, Town of Sandgate, was advertised for sale, with interested persons to apply to William Potts, Queen Street, Brisbane. The map advertising the sale includes the location of the proposed railway terminus, and situates the proposed subdivisions between a lagoon and the esplanade. Newspaper advertisements describe the proposed subdivisions as \\"choice marine villa sites\\". On 29 April 1880, Sandgate was proclaimed a municipality known as the Borough of Sandgate. The Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced all Divisions and Boroughs with Towns and Shires, creating the Town of Sandgate on 31 March 1903. This new status meant a town council was formed to guide the development of the local area. Initially, the council chambers were located in Shorncliffe. However, following a fire which destroyed the council chambers in 1910, a much larger town hall was opened in 1911. The Sandgate Town Hall was extensively renovated in 2011 to mark the 100th anniversary of the hall. The Sandgate Town Council, which operated from 1880 to 1925, had to provide a range of services for the growing community. These included a fire department, ambulance, and sanitation facilities, as well as maintaining roads and regulating local development. In October 1925 the Town of Sandgate was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. A Church of England was built in Signal Row on the corner of Yundah Street (), then the centre of the developing town. It was opened and dedicated on Sunday 12 December 1880 by Bishop Matthew Hale. It was a timber church and able to accommodate 150 people. It was designed by architect FDG Stanley and built by contractors Woodward and Betts of Brisbane. In September 1886 it was announced that it would be dedicated to St Nicolas, the patron saint of sailors and sea-farers, a common practice in seaside towns. In 1887 it was enlarged which involved re-orienting the building on the block so the chancel was to the south rather than to the original east. In 1930 the undercroft was enclosed with bricks to form a church wall. The church closed in 1988. The Queensland Government purchased the church and incorporated it into Shorncliffe State School but subsequently demolished it due to extensive termite damage. Its stained glass windows were preserved and are now in St Margaret's Anglican Church. The first Catholic Church was opened on 25 September 1881. It was a small brick building which remains in use as the office of the Sacred Heart Primary School. The coming of the railway in 1882 promoted more rapid development of the Sandgate area. Travel to Brisbane by train could be completed in less than half an hour. On 12 August 1882 the Garden Estate, Sandgate was advertised for auction by James R. Dickson. An estate map shows the 61 blocks making up the estate at the area bounded by Rainbow and Friday Streets. The Sandgate Baptist church opened on the corner of Cliff Street and Flinders Parade in 1887. It has since undergone multiple restorations, yet has continued to remain in its original structure. It is no longer operating as a church, being now used as a child care centre. On Sunday 25 September 1892, the new Sacred Heart Catholic Church was opened and blessed by Cardinal Francis Moran assisted by Archibshop of Brisbane Robert Dunne. The former church building was to be used to establish a school. Sacred Heart Catholic School opened on Monday 23 January 1893 in the former church. It opened with an initial enrolment of 50 students was operated by three Sisters of Mercy from the All Hallows' Convent in Fortitude Valley. The first principal was Sister Mary Borgia. The school also provided boarding facilities for some years. A purpose-built school building was constructed in 1920. The school provided secondary education until 1980 when St John Fisher College opened in neighbouring Bracken Ridge. In 1995 principal Sister Mary O‚ÄôDonoghue retired and Glenda Honan was appointed as the first lay principal. On 27 December 1920, 33 building sites in the Nashville Heights Estate were advertised for auction by Lyons & Coaldrake. A map showing the allotments, which are in the area currently bounded by Alexandra Street, Nash Street, Darling Street and Borella Street, notes the blocks' proximity to the Sandgate Central Station, beach, state school and post office. Swimming at Moora park in 1937 Sandgate boasted clean beaches that were a popular weekend destination, with thousands of people visiting from Brisbane to escape the heat. Boating, swimming and golf were the most common sporting activities. Moora Park was the location for dances and open-air films. Sandgate Library opened in 1952 with a major refurbishment in 1996. The Sandgate Little Theatre Group was established in 1958. They perform in the Sandgate Town Hall. Now known as Sandgate Theatre Incorporated, this community theatre group hosts Brisbane's longest running community theatre festival, the Yarrageh Drama Festival, which is held in August and September each year at the town hall. Sandgate Infants State School was separated from Sandgate State School in 1955. It was amalgamated back into Sandgate State School in 1971. Sandgate District State High School opened on 26 January 1959. Due to delays in the construction of the first school building, the first classes were taught in the Sandgate Town Hall. Sandgate Opportunity School opened on 26 April 1960. It was later renamed Sandgate Special School. It closed on 15 December 1995. In the , Sandgate had a population of 4,909 people.

In 2007, as a result of cost saving exercises, by owners Waltham Forest Borough Council, the museum's opening hours were cut back. This broke a stipulation of gifts by Sir Frank Brangwyn, that works should be on view for a minimum amount of time weekly.

Adam Jr and John C. Knudsen in 1998. The company was located at Centennial Airport in the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area of Colorado. The company certified and produced the inline piston twin-engined Adam A500, while the turbofan-powered Adam A700 AdamJet was under development. The A700 was intended to be an entrant into the niche of Very Light Jets (VLJs), but its development was ceased before production was achieved. One of the first Adam A500s manufactured, A500 s/n 0002, was featured in the 2006 Michael Mann film Miami Vice. In conjunction with partners, the company had won a major contract from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for the development of a next-generation rotorcraft, indicating possible longer-term product development potential. However, the firm ceased operations on 11 February 2008, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on 15 February 2008. In April 2008, the assets of the former company were purchased from bankruptcy by AAI Acquisition Inc. AAI failed to restart Adam Aircraft and in April 2009 Adam Aircraft finally ceased operations and laid off all its staff. In April 2011 Triton Aerospace announced that they had acquired the company's assets. History Adam A500 prototype during its flight test program at the Mojave Spaceport Adam A700 prototype =Financial problems and cessation of operations= In January 2008 it was announced that Adam Aircraft was having problems raising the capital required to complete certification flight testing of the A700 jet and to enter full production of the A500 piston aircraft. As a result, the company closed its Ogden, Utah plant and laid off 300 workers. Adam Aircraft President Duncan Koerbel was quoted as saying: > \\"To provide for our future growth, we must be strategic in our focus by > managing current cash expenditures to ensure adequate time to secure > financing for the long term. We're off to a good start in this effort with > assistance from our partner, Citibank, but we need to be able to provide > them with sufficient time working with potential investors to secure long > term financing.\\" The company indicated that it needed to raise between USD$75 and $150 million to produce the A500 and complete certification of the A700. In a 22 January 2008 letter to shareholders, company CEO John Wolf indicated that the company would face \\"liquidation\\" if it could not raise an additional USD$25M in the seven days that remained before the end of that month, because the company had loans due and could not pay them without the additional funds. On 11 February 2008 the company ceased operations, issuing a short news release that it was \\"due to the inability of the company to come to terms with their lender for funding necessary to maintain business operations.\\" On 14 February 2008 it was reported that employees of the company were optimistic that operations would be able to continue under new financing. At the same time aviation anonymous industry leaders interviewed by the aviation press expressed opinions that the company would not be saved and that there would be no choice but to have it liquidated. This prediction turned out correct, as the company filed for liquidation under Chapter 7 on 15 February 2008 The government of the City of Pueblo, Colorado demanded that USD$2M in financial incentives paid to firm be returned. As part of its agreement with the city, Adam Aircraft had agreed to create 448 jobs, but had only created 90 jobs, almost all eliminated in the round of lay-offs in January, preceding closure. The city filed liens against Adam Aircraft's physical equipment to recover the money owed. =AAI Acquisition= On April 11, 2008, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado approved the sale of the company for $10 million to AAI Acquisition Inc an entity jointly controlled by Russian firms Industrial Investors and Kaskol. Industrial Investors is a private equity management company with $3 billion in assets, notably Far East Shipping Company. According to their statement, former Colorado Governor Bill Owens is a director of one of its companies. At the time of purchase, AAI VP Dmitry Shokhin said: \\"We plan to revive Adam Aircraft's operations, including continuing the process of certification for the A700 jet\\". Industrial Investments had reportedly ordered 75 A700s prior to Adam Aircraft's bankruptcy, and restarted work on the A700 with 60 employees back at work by May 2008. According to a July 2008 statement by Sergey Generalov, CEO and owner of Industrial Investors, more than ten other companies had bid for the assets of bankrupt AAI. prior to the tender the company made a deal with 50 Adams engineers, persuading them to stay with AAI, thus securing the winning bid. In addition to the US$10 million purchase price, Generalov expected to invest another US$150 million before the project would generate any return. The new company confirmed at AirVenture 2008 that they would proceed with certification of the A700 and had indicated an initial forecast completion date in the first quarter of 2010. The company also confirmed that they would not produce the A500 for the foreseeable future, due to the global drop in demand for piston-engined aircraft Citing the economic crisis of 2008 AAI Acquisition President and CEO Jack Braly announced on 28 October 2008 that A700 \\"Flight test and other development activity have been suspended\\". Braly indicated that the company's investment team and board of directors were reviewing the economic and market conditions and would decide on a new schedule for certifying the A700. The company laid off 200 employees in October 2008, leaving 30 engineering staff at work. In January 2009 the company announced it was seeking a new strategic partner to help it expand into new areas of business: sub-contract engineering and manufacturing for the aerospace and custom automotive industry, projects that could make use of the company's expertise in composite design and manufacturing. The company said that it had not abandoned the A700 jet project. Company Vice President of Business Development Steve Patrick said: \\"Based on our initial efforts, we are building a viable business base for our engineering solutions and services while retaining the option to re-launch the A700 business jet.\\" In April 2009, unable to find non-aerospace work for its facilities, new partners and out of operating capital, AAI Acquisition closed Adam Aircraft and laid off the last of its staff. =Triton America= In July 2009, real estate developer Thomas Hsueh purchased the remaining tooling, parts, and intellectual property of Adam Aircraft from the Russian investors. Doing business as Triton America LLC, in Anacortes, Washington, his company planned to redesign the A500 and A700, and return the aircraft to production at the Port of Skagit County, Skagit County, Washington. In April 2011 Triton Aerospace of Skagit Regional Airport in Burlington, Washington announced that they had acquired the assets of Adam Aircraft. The company announced that it intended to return the A500 to production after re-engineering it to lose of empty weight and recertifiying it. The aircraft will also be changed to a turboprop, with twin-engined and rear-engined-only versions. Two new prototypes were expected in 2013 with re- certification to follow. The company owner, Thomas Hsueh, indicated that for now production is planned for the US, but costs may require moving the assembly line to China, or even a lower cost country, such as Mexico. Triton indicated that they have no plans to produce the A700 jet.

Grigory Ivanovich Shelekhov (–ì—Ä–∏–≥–æÃÅ—Ä–∏–π –ò–≤–∞ÃÅ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –®–µÃÅ–ª–∏—Ö–æ–≤ in Russian) (1747, Rylsk, Belgorod Governorate ‚Äì July 20, 1795 (July 31, 1795 New Style)) was a Russian seafarer, merchant and fur trader.  Career  Starting in 1775, Shelekhov organized voyages of merchant ships to the Kuril Islands and the Aleutian Islands, in what is now Alaska, for fur trading. In 1783‚Äì1786, he led an expedition to the coastal shores of the mainland, where they founded the first permanent Russian settlements in North America. Shelekhov's voyage was done under the auspices of his Shelikhov-Golikov Company, the other owner of which was Ivan Larionovich Golikov. This company was the predecessor of the Russian-American Company, which was founded in 1799.Piotr A. Tikhmenev: A History of the Russian-American Company , editors Alton S. Donnelly, Richard Pierce (Seattle: University of Washington Press, English translation 1978; pp. 48‚Äì59) (the original Russian work was published in 1861). In April 1784, Shelekhov arrived in what he named as Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island with two ships, the Three Hierarchs, Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian and John Chrysostom and the St. Simon.\\"Alaska History Timeline\\". Retrieved on August 31, 2005. The indigenous Koniaga, an Alutiiq nation of Alaska Natives, defended themselves from the Russian party. In what became known as the Awa'uq Massacre, Shelekhov and his armed forces, who had guns and cannons, killed hundreds of the Alutiiq, including women and children. They also took hundreds of hostages, many of them children, to force submission by other Alaska Natives. Having established his authority on Kodiak Island, Shelekhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in Alaska along the island's Three Saints Bay. (Unalaska had been established long before, but it was not considered the permanent base for Russians until Shelekhov‚Äôs time.) In 1790, Shelekhov, having returned to Russia, hired Alexandr Baranov to manage his fur enterprise in Russian America, see Maritime fur trade. The settlement of Grigory Shelekhov in Kodiak Island. A gulf in the Sea of Okhotsk, a strait between Alaska and Kodiak Island, and a town in Irkutsk Oblast in Russia bear Shelekhov's name. Shelekhov travelled via Shelekhov Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk in December 1786-January 1787, after he had been left behind at Bol‚Äôshereck in Kamchatka as the winds tore the Three Hierarcs from her anchors and carried her out to sea.Richard Pierce in his introduction to Shelekhov‚Äôs A Voyage to America 1783‚Äì1786. There is a statue of Shelekhov in his native Rylsk.  Family  In 1775 Shelekhov married Natalia Alexeyevna Kozhevina, the daughter of a prominent clan of Okhotsk navigators and mapmakers and their wives. At his death he had five surviving daughters and one son.

Towards equatorial latitudes, species of Calamagrostis generally occur at higher elevations. These tufted perennials usually have hairless narrow leaves. The ligules are usually blunt. The inflorescence forms a panicle. Some may be reed-like. The plants may be rhizomatous (underground stems with shoots), stoloniferous (with runners), or caespitose (growing in tufts or clumps). The bisexual spikelets have a single floret and generally they are purple or purple-brown. The spikelets are clustered into inflorescences, which usually develop in early- to mid-summer on long culms ( = stems). Many species of Calamagrostis are morphologically similar, but they generally occur in distinct habitats, and they have unique geographical distributions. Given the subtle distinctions between many closely related taxa, there are several species complexes that could benefit from additional systematic study. Even the generic boundaries of the genus are controversial. For example, species in the genus Deyeuxia, distributed largely in the southern hemisphere are morphologically very similar to species of Calamagrostis. It may be appropriate to recognize all of these species in a single genus, but this will require detailed scientific study of DNA of species from around the world. Some Calamagrostis can be very decorative, and are widely cultivated largely in northern temperate zones. The species Calamagrostis brachytricha and the cultivar Calamagrostis √ó acutiflora 'Karl Foerster' are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books, movies, video games, novels, and animated series. He is the supreme leader of the terrorist organization Cobra, and is the main archenemy of the Joes. The character is also featured as an opponent of G.I. Joe in other series, such as Sigma 6 and Renegades, as well as subsequent comic books, video games, and movies. He was portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and by Luke Bracey with the voice of Robert Baker in the 2013 sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Profile Cobra Commander is a fanatical leader who rules with an iron fist and demands total loyalty or allegiance. His objective is total control of the world's governments, people, wealth, and resources, brought about by revolution and chaos. He's believed to have personally led uprisings in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and other trouble spots, while being held responsible for kidnapping scientists, businessmen, and military leaders, forcing them to reveal their top level secrets. Over the years, Cobra Commander has suffered assassination attempts, and even an imposter posing as him for a time. However, he always manages to find a way out of every situation, having become a constant foil for the G.I. Joe Team, who have ended up fighting Cobra almost exclusively. No matter how dire or unscathed, Cobra Commander's hatred and drive have only grown ruthless and more focused. Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander's persona runs the gamut from friendly charismatic, to terrifyingly sociopathic. His charm can twist intentions and morals, so that his rhetoric actually reads as plausible and relatable to his minions. Psychoanalysts who have studied his case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny, and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures around the world. The character was created by Marvel Comics writer Larry Hama, who envisioned the character as \\"being in love with the sound of his own voice,\\" and drew inspiration from famous conservative pundit William F. Buckley. Toys Cobra Commander was first released as a mail-in figure in 1982. Wearing a light blue uniform and his signature battle helmet, early production runs were marked with an early version of the Cobra sigil, nicknamed the \\"Mickey Mouse\\" emblem for its more rounded shape. All of the original sixteen figures from 1982 were released with \\"straight arms\\". In 1983, the figure with the proper Cobra sigil was released on a card for mass market with \\"swivel-arm battle grip\\", which made it easier for figures to hold their rifles and accessories. In 1984, the Commander was offered again as a mail-away exclusive, this time in a darker blue, with the iconic hood that he wore prominently in the Marvel comics. This figure continued to be available as a mail-away figure until the line ended in 1994. In 1987, a new Cobra Commander figure was designed, this time outfitting him in full-body battle armor. Cobra Commander was given another overhaul in 1991, wearing a blue and black ceremonial uniform, with an ornate redesign of his original battle helmet. Also in 1991, a \\"Talking Battle Commander\\" figure was released, featuring a blue and yellow uniform inspired by the hooded Cobra Commander figure. This figure was repainted in black with silver accents, for 1993's Battle Corps subset. A 12\\" version of the Commander wearing the same uniform (blue with yellow accents) was released in 1993 as well. In 1994, Cobra Commander was suited up for space combat as part of the Star Brigade. Wearing a teal and purple spacesuit, the Commander's domed helmet was removable, revealing a masked head underneath. This face is similar to the sculpt which lay under the hood of the 12\\" figure, with dark hair, and a half mask covering his nose and mouth. After the line was canceled in 1994, Hasbro made several attempts to resurrect A Real American Hero through repaint series. In 1997, Cobra Commander was released as part of the \\"Cobra Command Team\\" 3-pack, using the 1987 Battle Armor mold in a dark blue. In 2000, the Talking Battle Commander mold was repainted (sans talking backpack) in an even darker blue, with silver highlights, with a new character \\"Chameleon\\" (a Baroness doppelganger created to sidestep copyright problems). A second repaint of the 1987 figure was made available in 2001, in a muted version of its original color scheme. It was also a double-pack with the 'Laser-Viper' figure. =Modern= In 2002, the Commander was initially meant to be redesigned by Hasbro. After the more radical elements were removed, the Commander emerged as one of the least extreme make-overs of the line, once again sporting the iconic hood. A second Commander figure was released in 2003 for Spy Troops, featuring a more military look than the Commander has ever had before, and using the Commander's signature Battle Helmet. Both figures went on to be repainted multiple times in 2004's Valor vs. Venom line, including one version with an interchangeable helmet and hood. A 12\\" Cobra Commander was released to coincide with the Spy Troops line, based on the same design as its smaller counterpart. A version of Cobra Commander with no accessories came with the Built to Rule Cobra H.I.S.S. in 2004. The figure featured additional articulation with a mid-thigh cut joint, plus the forearms and calves of the figure sported places where blocks could be attached.Cobra H.I.S.S. w/ Cobra Commander at YOJOE.com Retrieved 2012-04-25 =25th Anniversary= 2007 was the 25th Anniversary of the original launch of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. To celebrate, Hasbro created three boxed sets of brand new figures, featuring modern sculpt and updated and increased articulation (including the replacement of G.I. Joe's trademark O-ring construction). Cobra Commander was included in the inaugural Cobra set, along with Destro, Baroness, Storm Shadow, and a Cobra Trooper. The figure was rereleased on a single card, and repainted in black and gold for the \\"Cobra Legions\\" 5-pack, and in comic accurate colors for a Comic 2-Pack. Mirroring the vintage line, Cobra Commander was released with a hooded head sculpt in the first wave of single carded figures. A second Cobra Commander sculpt, based on the 1987 Battle Armor figure, was released in early 2008. The Battle Helmet version from 2007 was repainted in cartoon accurate colors for a second single card release, and the \\"Cobra Senior Officers\\" 3-Pack. The hooded version was repainted for the 'Crimson Guard\\" 3-Pack. Comics =Marvel Comics= Cobra Commander first appeared in the Marvel Comics series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #1 (June 1982). While Cobra Commander's birth name and childhood are unknown, he is believed to be a North American citizen born in the mid-twentieth century. His only known relative, an older brother named Dan, enlisted in the military during the Vietnam War, and volunteered for repeated tours to spare his younger sibling from conscription. During this time, the man who would become Cobra Commander worked as a used car salesman. When Dan returned from Vietnam, he displayed deep psychological trauma, and took to self-destructive behavior, resulting in his death in a car collision with another family. Devastated by the loss of his brother, the future Cobra Commander blamed the family's survivor: another war veteran, against whom the young Cobra Commander formed an elaborate revenge scheme. Cobra Commander tracked the former soldier to Japan, where he was training to become a member of the Arashikage ninja clan. The Commander approached the mercenary Firefly to assassinate the soldier, but Firefly referred Cobra Commander to Zartan, another assassin who infiltrated the clan, but ultimately killed the wrong man (the Hard Master). Storm Shadow was blamed for the murder, and his search for his uncle's killer would eventually lead him to join Cobra, where he'd pledge loyalty to Cobra Commander as his personal bodyguard, in order to get close to him and find the real assassin. The soldier left the ninja clan soon after, to live in seclusion in the Sierra Nevada mountains, until enticed to return to service on the G.I. Joe team as Snake Eyes. Cobra Commander returned to his wife and newborn son Billy, but when his wife found out what had happened in Japan, she threatened to go to the authorities. Cobra Commander abandoned his wife, taking Billy with him. Living on the road and earning a living by increasingly illicit scams and con jobs, the soon-to-be Commander blamed all his problems on the American social system, and traveled in search of people who shared his desire to topple big business and the government, using money earned from pyramid schemes to attract followers. It was during these early meetings that he first began wearing a blue hood to mask his civilian identity.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #10 (April 1983) He then moved operations to Springfield, an average small American town which had suffered economic collapse. Through his criminal skills he revived Springfield's' fortunes, and used cash and charisma to win converts to his cause. Eventually he seized control of the entire town and used it as a base to grow his organization into the paramilitary group \\"Cobra.\\" This corrupting rise to power distanced Cobra Commander from his son, enough that Billy eventually joined the underground anti-Cobra resistance. From Springfield, Cobra's agents spread throughout the world, overturning or subverting unstable governments to establish criminal networks and profitable arms trades. The organization also explored dangerous and experimental technology, including mind-scanners and battle robots. Cobra became a significant international threat, becoming so large that Cobra Commander could no longer control it on his own. He created a \\"High Command\\" of his most skilled lieutenants, which included Zartan, Baroness Anastasia DeCobray, Scottish arms dealer James McCullen Destro, and Australian mercenary Major Sebastian Bludd.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #31-32 (Jan.-Feb. 1985) This led to frequent power-struggles within the organization, and ultimately the Baroness and Major Bludd enacted a plot to assassinate the Commander, and seize control of Cobra. In a twist of fate, the conspirators recruited Billy to carry out the assassination, but he was intercepted by Destro.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #33 (March 1985) Cobra Commander had no qualms about torturing his own son to unearth the conspiracy, yet Billy refused to surrender who had sponsored the hit. Storm Shadow later freed Billy, and they both escaped to New York, where Storm Shadow trained him in ninjitsu. Billy was later caught in the crossfire between the Soft Master and Cobra agent Scrap-Iron, resulting in an explosion which seemingly killed Billy and several others.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #43 (January 1986) During a failed assault on the Pit, the secret headquarters of G.I. Joe, Cobra Commander and Destro were separated from the main Cobra force by an explosion and presumed dead.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #53 (November 1986) The two escaped and assumed civilian disguises to travel incognito. Cobra Commander was depicted as an average, physically fit Caucasian with a pony tail, large round green- spectacle sunglasses, and a long slender mustache. Although only a convenient disguise at the time, this civilian look would resurface on subsequent unmaskings. A police officer soon recognized the Commander from a picture carried by an accident victim: the Commander's son Billy, who had survived the explosion, but lost a leg and an eye. Unnerved by the discovery, the Commander swore to take responsibility for Billy's condition, and promised to be a better father.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #55 (January 1987) Still incognito, the Commander traveled to Denver where he sought out the undercover Crimson Guard agent Fred VII, a mechanical genius. Billy eventually awoke from the coma, with acute amnesia (and a new motorized prosthetic leg built by Fred). After an encounter with the Blind Master and Storm Shadow's cousin Jinx, Billy recovered his memory and immediately rejected his father, whereupon the Commander renounced the organization he had founded, declaring that his ambitions had cost him the only things that truly mattered. Fred VII, in return, shot Cobra Commander in the back, apparently killing him.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #61 (July 1987) Fred VII then impersonated the Commander himself, traveling to Cobra Island to vie for control of Cobra with Serpentor (eventually sparking the Cobra Civil War). Unknown to Fred VII, he had been under surveillance by another Crimson Guardsman when he buried the Commander's body. This agent discovered that Cobra Commander was not dead, and brought him back to health. Thereafter, the Commander formed an underground network of loyal agents within Cobra, and rebuilt his personal fortune and influence. When Doctor Mindbender went to harvest DNA from Cobra Commander's body for the creation of a new leader, he discovered the empty grave, upon which the original Cobra Commander revealed himself and seized open control of Cobra.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #98 (March 1990) Hardened by his \\"death\\" and betrayal at the hands of those he once thought loyal, the resurgent Commander was even more ruthless than before. His first act was to eliminate those who tried to murder him or came to know of the act subsequently: Fred VII, Raptor, Firefly, Mindbender, Zartan, Billy, and numerous unnamed Cobra personnel, all of whom he had buried alive within a volcano. Later, he established a brainwashing program to compel allegiance from those around him, including Destro, the Baroness, Zartan, Storm Shadow, and Billy.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #149 (June 1994) The returned Commander was far more willing to kill, pulling the trigger himself rather than relying on others to kill for him, as when he murdered the Borovian rebels Magda and the White Clown.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #145 (February 1994) As Marvel's G.I. Joe series drew to a close, Cobra Commander and Snake Eyes finally battled each other in issue #150. Snake Eyes eventually won against an armored Cobra Commander, but the Commander would have the last laugh, as he captured Storm Shadow and successfully brainwashed him back to the allegiance of Cobra. Shortly afterward, Cobra forces in Europe fell to a unified attack by regular military forces. In the wake of this conflict, most of Cobra's high command disappeared, and Cobra Commander himself became an international fugitive. Soon after, the military disbanded the G.I. Joe team.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #155 (December 1994) =Devil's Due= Among the few revisions Devil's Due instituted was the expansion of Cobra Commander's origin. After his brother's death, the future Commander sought out the surviving son of the family killed by Dan. He found the soldier (Snake Eyes) at a bar, where the Commander saved him from an oncoming truck and the two became friends. They traveled from state to state, acting as vigilantes. One night, Cobra Commander took Snake Eyes to the house of a corrupt Judge who he blamed for the hardships they had both experienced: years before, the judge had presided over a case involving Cobra Commander's brother Dan, who ran a veteran's hospital. The hospital had been burned down by a patient, but the judge ruled that it was insurance fraud; Dan lost everything and turned to drinking, which led to the crash that took his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Realizing where his anger had taken him, Snake Eyes refused to kill the man and walked away. Cobra Commander killed the judge himself and vowed revenge against Snake Eyes for having turned on him.SNAKE EYES: DECLASSIFIED #2 (September 2005) Years after the G.I. Joe Team has disbanded, Kamakura finds evidence that Cobra Commander has returned to the United States. Snake Eyes forwards this information to Duke, who uses it to have the G.I. Joe Team reinstated. Cobra Commander calls together the members of his organization, to let them know about his plan to take over the United States with nano-mites. Destro is the last to arrive, but after hearing the Commander's plan, he turns the tables on Cobra Commander, and takes control of Cobra.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #1 (October 2001) Cobra Commander eventually regains control with the help of Storm Shadow, and creates plans to get revenge on both Destro and Hawk.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #6-9 (2002) Later, Storm Shadow breaks free of Cobra's mind control, and contacts Billy for help. Billy recruits Snake Eyes and Kamakura to assist him in rescuing Storm Shadow, but not before Cobra Commander brainwashes him again. A battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow ends in a stalemate, leaving Storm Shadow in the control of Cobra Commander.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #20-21 (2003) A distress call from T'Jbang leads the Joes to Tibet, where Cobra Commander and Storm Shadow are hiding with the Red Ninja clan. Snake Eyes defeats their leader Sei Tin, and becomes the new master of the Red Ninja clan.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #27 (February 2004) The Joes are then sent on a mission to Cobra Island, where Cobra Commander has returned to power. Meanwhile, Destro is double-crossed by the president of Sierra Gordo, and makes a deal with Duke to deliver Cobra Commander. Destro is traded for Cobra Commander, but not before the Commander shoots Hawk in the back, and in turn is shot from behind by the Baroness.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #28-32 (2004) Cobra Commander is freed by the Dreadnoks, and revealed to have been Zartan in disguise.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #36-38 (2004-2005) Cobra Commander takes back complete control of Cobra, and sends a unit to destroy The Pit, as Cobra discovers a weather control weapon named the Tempest, and moves it to their new Monolith Base in Badhikstan. Cobra uses the Tempest to unleash the Deathangel Virus on the county of Badhi, as G.I. Joe attacks Cobra's new stronghold. Cobra Commander escapes, but not before shooting Dr. Mindbender, who dies helping G.I. Joe to disable the Tempest.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #39-41 (2005) The Red Shadows organization then steps forward, targeting members of both G.I. Joe and Cobra. They are defeated by G.I. Joe, and the team is then deactivated by order of the President, given that Cobra as an organization has fractured, although Cobra Commander remains at large.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #43 (June 2005) America's Elite One year after the previous series, satellites begin falling out of orbit and crashing into major cities, resulting in massive civilian casualties. Thinking that Cobra is responsible for the attacks, the G.I. Joe Team is reactivated to deal with the new threat. The team eventually discovers that a man named Vance Wingfield, who once attempted to start a nuclear war and was presumed dead, is behind the attacks.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #0-5 (June‚ÄìNovember 2005) Meanwhile, Cobra Commander, who has been rebuilding his forces since the end of the previous series, infiltrates the U.S. government by disguising himself as White House Chief of Staff Garrett Freelowe. He tries to convince the President to shut down the G.I. Joe team. When he fails, he creates a new team called the Phoenix Guard led by General Philip Rey, a former G.I. Joe commander.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #13 (July 2006) The Phoenix Guard infiltrates G.I. Joe headquarters, and manages to capture several Joes, until General Rey discovers the true identities of the Phoenix Guard members. G.I. Joe then captures most of the Phoenix Guard, and after the failed attack on G.I. Joe headquarters, Cobra Commander abandons the White House.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #17-18 (Nov.-Dec. 2006) The Baroness then pursues a campaign of revenge against her betrayers, Cobra Commander and Wraith. During her quest, she finds Wraith in a club in Prague, and lures him into a cemetery where she confronts and defeats him, shooting him in the head. She trades his armor to the Red Shadows, in exchange for information on the whereabouts of Cobra Commander. The Baroness locates the Commander in Honduras, but finds that Destro, her husband, is also present. After a brief fight, Destro agrees to trade the M.A.R.S. corporation, his Iron Grenadier forces, and his eldest son Alexander to Cobra Commander, in exchange for his and the Baroness' baby. Cobra Commander avoids capture, by revealing that he possesses the personal information of every G.I. Joe agent, because of his time working in the White House.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #21-24 (March‚ÄìJune 2007) Cobra Commander uses his control of M.A.R.S. weapons to create conflict all over the globe, in a last bid to gain control of the world. G.I. Joe counters by going on the offensive, mobilizing the entire G.I. Joe roster, and launching missions to capture Cobra agents still at large. Meanwhile, Cobra Commander recruits soldier Nick Bailey, making him the last member of a new elite Cobra unit code-named \\"The Plague\\".G.I. Joe: America's Elite #25 (July 2007) The main G.I. Joe team heads to Israel, where they help stop an assassination attempt. While the team is away, Cobra Commander attacks Washington, D.C., taking over the White House and capturing the President. Cobra also takes over Fort Meade, while Alexander McCullen attacks London and France with the Iron Grenadiers.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #29 (November 2007) Cobra Commander then sends Tomax and a squad of Night Creepers to \\"The Coffin\\", a prison in Greenland created to hold all of G.I. Joe's captured enemies. Tomax manages to free Major Bludd and several others, while killing those Cobra Commander considered \\"loose ends\\". Dela Eden, who had been freed from The Coffin, is recruited by Cobra Commander to find Destro and the Baroness, in order to kill them. Cobra takes over several nuclear arsenals, including one in Suffolk, England. As a warning, Cobra Commander detonates a nuclear bomb in The Empty Quarter, and then broadcasts an ultimatum on television for world leaders to accede to his authority, or he will start choosing populated targets. Billy, Cobra Commander's son, confronts his father at Fort Meade and tries to kill him. He fails, and Cobra Commander kills him instead, hanging Billy's body from a flagpole, with a message that no one is untouchable.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #30-33 (Dec. 2007-March 2008) After the Joes defeat a plan by Cobra Commander to blow up nukes in the Amazon and Antarctica, Cobra Commander and The Plague retreat to a secret base in the Appalachian Mountains, where the first Cobra soldiers were trained. When the Joes attack the Appalachian base, General Colton is shot in the back by Cobra Commander, but survives. The battle ends, when Hawk tackles Cobra Commander, and knocks him out with a punch to the face. In the aftermath, the Joes are still active and fully funded, and Cobra Commander is locked away in a special underwater prison.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #36 (June 2008) Hasbro later announced that all stories published by Devil's Due Publishing are no longer considered canonical, and are now considered an alternate continuity. =IDW Publishing= In IDW's series, \\"The Commander\\" is a title and rank, not an individual, and there have been numerous Commanders in the past: they've been elected and placed in power by a ruling body called the Cobra Council. The first Cobra Commander was a well-known, famous businessman, operating as the Commander in secret.G.I. Joe: Cobra Civil War #1 His uniform was a suit and tie, with gloves and variation of the silver face mask. Rather than having an army helmet over the blank face plate mask, the lower portion of the mask has fangs engraved around the jaw line. Unlike other incarnations of the character, this version of Cobra Commander - usually just called \\"the Commander\\" - is extremely reclusive, and his existence is only known to only select high-profile Cobra subordinates (such as the twins Tomax and Xamot and the Baroness). Cobra Commander's personality is also much more passive- aggressive and introspective; having captured the G.I. Joe spy Chuckles, Cobra Commander refuses to allow Tomax and Xamot to kill the spy, opting instead to personally recruit Chuckles, by taking him into his confidence and promising him revenge against Xamot. In issue #12 of \\"G.I. Joe: Cobra\\", Xamot attempts to set up Cobra Commander to be killed and Chuckles to be blamed, only to learn the Commander has outmaneuvered him. Chuckles does manage to kill the Commander anyway, shooting him through the head. This is the first time a Commander has been killed in action, and a competition erupts in Cobra to find who will be the replacement, directed by the Cobra Council. The competition becomes a contest of who can kill the most Joes: competing Cobra agents include Baroness, Dr. Vargas, Major Bludd, Oda Satori, Tomax, Krake, and Raja Khallikhan.G.I. Joe: Cobra Civil War #0 Baroness does not believe the Council would make her the Commander as she's a woman - not that this stops her from killing Joes.Cobra: Civil War #1 Krake wins the competition, largely by revealing that he had killed and replaced one of his rivals with Zartan, doubling his kill score and showing the initiative to break the rules to win. Krake's origin would be given in Cobra Annual 2012: born in Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle during a battle and named Tiger Eyes, he grew up as a child laborer and later child soldier for drug gangs. He was named Krake by Major Bludd, who was impressed when he told Krake he had a spy in his gang and the man responded by killing every other member. Krake was invited to join Cobra, initially resisting but later providing the means to take over several Chinese triads.Cobra Annual 2012: The Origin of Cobra Commander The first action Krake takes as Commander is to openly invade the Southeast Asian nation of Nanzhao and steal its gold reserves. During the invasion, he destroys heroin poppy fields, so it initially looks to the world like Cobra is overthrowing a brutal regime and fighting the drug trade; it also drives up the price of heroin, a drug Cobra deals in.G.I. Joe vol. 2 #9: \\"Cobra Command Part 1\\" The Cobra Council are then slaughtered by Krake's agents, giving him full command of Cobra.Cobra vol. 2 #10: \\"Cobra Command Part 6\\" Writers Chuck Dixon and Mike Costa have said that while the previous Commander allowed his subordinates to \\"pursue their own goals so long as they kick back to him\\" and was content to \\"profit invisibly\\", Krake \\"wants to be known and wants to be powerful, and wants to rule the world in the most supervillainy sense... With his leadership, Cobra shifts from a sneaky, shadowy cabal to an actual military presence.\\" G.I. Joe: Origins involves a psychotic ex-stock broker, who murders his family and several law enforcement officers when his crimes are discovered. Calling himself \\"the Chimera\\" and gathering a militia around him, he is one of the first villains that G.I. Joe faces. It is also noted that he started the sub-prime mortgage crisis of the late 2000s. Larry Hama had intended him to be Cobra Commander, but this idea was dropped with the introduction of the Cobra Council, and has not been seen since Origins #5. It has not been specified if he was indeed the Cobra Commander that Chuckles murdered.G.I. Joe: Origins #1-5 =UK continuities= In the UK Battle Action Force comic, Cobra Commander was originally known as Baron Ironblood, leader of the Red Shadows, a ruthless terrorist organization. The Red Shadows were legions of brainwashed fanatic soldiers armed with sophisticated, high-tech weapons. The group was declared the single greatest threat to world security by the UN, with Ironblood being labeled \\"World Enemy #1\\". In 1985, Hasbro began moves to market G.I. Joe in the UK, under the Action Force name. This would affect the comic version of Battle Action Force, as the writers were to get rid of the Red Shadows and Baron Ironblood and replace them with Cobra and Cobra Commander. To preserve continuity within the comic, the decision was made to transform Baron Ironblood in to the Action Force version of Cobra Commander. The transition came as Baron Ironblood grew tired of his group's failures and decided to destroy the Red Shadows, by secretly informing Action Force of the group's bases. Going into hiding, Ironblood relocated to Southeast Asia, where he had plastic surgery on his face, constructed a new mask and costumed identity (that of Cobra Commander), and underwent extensive treatment to give him immunity towards all forms of snake venom (a process known as mithridatism). He then began the process of recruiting a new inner circle and organisation, known as Cobra. Unfortunately for Ironblood, his illicit fortune to finance this new army is stolen by former Red Shadow member, Red Jackal, who he is forced to rebuild as a cyborg (and rechristened as \\"Destro\\"). Furthermore, both surviving members of the Red Shadows and the retooled Action Force repeatedly foil his plans. In the final Battle Action Force storyline, after an attempt to locate the headquarters of the Action Force team fails and leads to a crushing defeat of his forces, Ironblood/Cobra Commander goes insane and collapses into a near catatonic state. In Action Force Weekly, Cobra Commander is a featured character starting from issue #1, where he is depicted as bald.\\"Action Force\\" #1 (March 1987) Destro believes Cobra Commander's excesses are the greatest risk to Cobra's success. Animated series =Sunbow= In the first season of the original 1980s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero animated series, Cobra Commander is the leader of Cobra, described in the show's opening theme as \\"A ruthless, terrorist organization determined to rule the world\\". His face is always covered, either by a featureless chrome mask concealing his entire face or by a hood with eye- hole cutouts. He wears a blue military uniform, occasionally sporting a cape and carrying a scepter, depending on the occasion. His distinctively shrill, raspy voice was provided by Chris Latta. He had a knack for concocting creative schemes for world domination - including cloned dinosaurs, giant amoebas, miniaturized troops stowed away inside Christmas presents, and using a super-laser to gleefully carve a picture of his face on the moon - plans which his immediate subordinates, particularly Destro, often blasted as ridiculous. The writers later commented that they only found Cobra Commander's personality when they stopped writing him as an Adolf Hitler-type and started writing him more in the vein of Yosemite Sam. Season 2 opened with the 5-episode mini-series Arise, Serpentor, Arise! in which elements of Cobra, disillusioned by Cobra Commander, decide to literally create a new leader to replace him. Acting as an operation to create a super-soldier, Cobra agents are sent around the world to collect DNA samples retrieved from the tombs of history's most notorious despots to genetically craft Cobra Commander's successor, Serpentor, who immediately assumes charge of Cobra and deposes the erstwhile Commander to the status of \\"lackey.\\" Fortunately for the Commander, G.I. Joe interferes with the gene collection to deny Serpentor the critical inclusion of Sun Tzu's DNA, and it is instead replaced with Sgt. Slaughter's. The substitution makes Serpentor prone to impulsive foolhardiness, which shows during a full-scale attack on Washington, D.C. Cobra Commander rescues the high command from certain disaster, and saves himself by convincing Serpentor that he truly needs him as a scapegoat. Thereafter, Cobra Commander seems to be employed as Cobra's primary field commander, while Serpentor leads mostly from the Terrordrome. Serpentor even allows Cobra Commander to be the organization's second-in-command, a decision tolerated by the rest of the Cobra High Command. Cobra Commander spends most of Season 2 trying to reclaim his former glory from under Serpentor's domineering shadow, assembling his own secret society called The Coil to that end. G.I. Joe: The Movie explains Cobra Commander's origin in full while contradicting background information previously established in the animated series. Cobra Commander is revealed to be a former scientist and nobleman from the ancient, pre-human society of Cobra-La. Although humanoid in appearance, he has pale blue skin, no hair, and eyes with snake-like pupils. The nobleman was disfigured by mutative spores in a laboratory accident, causing him to grow an array of eight additional eyes over his face, explaining why he wears a mask. Despite this deformity, his ambition was recognized and he was selected by Cobra-La's ruler, Golobulus, to venture from their isolated Himalayan kingdom into the outside world. He was instructed to establish an army for the razing of human civilization and reemergence of Cobra-La into the rest of the world: that army is Cobra. This origin stands in contrast to the episode \\"Twenty Questions\\", where the Commander told an interviewing journalist that he was responsible for spearheading a mutiny at his military academy in his youth. In other episodes, aforementioned reactions to off-screen unmaskings or glimpses of the Commander's features are not in keeping with the inhumanly blue-skinned figure portrayed in the film. In light of Cobra's constant failures, Golobulus decides to put the Commander on trial and punishes him by forcing his further exposure to the spores; their effect begins to devolve him into a snake. He escapes with Joe member Roadblock, but Cobra Commander's \\"humanity\\" slips away as his body transforms. He literally loses his human form and ultimately becomes mentally unresponsive and transforms into an oversized snake. During the Joe assault on Cobra-La, he is last seen coming to Lt. Falcon's rescue during the final battle and foils Serpentor's attack, allowing G.I. Joe to defeat Serpentor and Golobulus and save the world. =DiC series= After the movie, as seen in G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Cobra Commander is still in his snake form and kept as a pet by Serpentor. However, Baroness restores him partly to a semi-human form‚Äîthrough exposure to an ancient primordial energy called Dragonfire, which is the focal point of the first five episodes of the new series. The basic shape of his body is humanoid, his skin and features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue. His intellect is fully restored, and upon being outfitted with his battle armor, Cobra Commander once again appears to be a humanoid male. He regains control of Cobra, and even dispatches Serpentor, using the new found Dragonfire energy to turn him into an oversize iguana. Cobra Commander's inhuman origins are never mentioned again, and he is never shown to have reptilian features again. In Season 2, he resumes wearing his original cloth mask, and his eyes and skin appear to be completely human. Chris Latta returned to voice Cobra Commander for the duration of the DiC series, credited in both seasons as Christopher Collins. =Transformers= Cobra Commander as \\"Old Snake\\". Cobra Commander appeared in the third season of the Transformers episode \\"Only Human\\". Set in the then-future year 2006, a trench-coated underground weapons dealer going by the name \\"Old Snake\\" is approached by crime lord Victor Drath, who wishes to purchase synthoid technology (as seen in a few episodes of the G.I. Joe animated series). Old Snake transfers the minds of Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Arcee and Springer into synthoid bodies, leaving their robotic shells for Drath's use in criminal activities. Although it is never explicitly stated that \\"Old Snake\\" is actually an aged Cobra Commander, his raspy voice is again provided by Chris Latta, he wears the character's distinctive silver mask, and has visible traces of his blue uniform underneath his trench coat. He is identified in dialogue as the former leader of a terrorist organization that used synthoid technology. At the end of the episode, Drath and his men are arrested, and Old Snake, being able to evade the authorities, laments about terrorists not being what they once were. He raises his fist skyward and starts to give the rally cry of Cobra, but breaks prematurely into a hacking cough. This version of Cobra Commander was commemorated with the unlicensed \\"Snake\\" toy produced by Headrobots, limited to 300 pieces, and officially in 2015 as part of the G.I. Joe and the Transformers line released by Hasbro through the Transformers Collectors' Club. According to the profile included with the latter figure, Old Snake further experimented with Transformer technology, and after a failed experiment dubbed Serpent O.R., he revived the Battle Android Trooper program, creating the Advanced Stealth B.A.T., capable of transforming into an unmanned aerial vehicle. =Sgt. Savage and the Screaming Eagles= Cobra Commander appears briefly in the pilot episode of Sgt. Savage and his Screaming Eagles, having a video conference with General Blitz concerning the relationship between Cobra and Blitz's I.R.O.N. Army. He wears the uniform of his 1992 action figure, and is voiced by Scott McNeil in this appearance. General Blitz refers to ties between the two groups, and states that he had helped create Cobra. He then threatens to destroy Cobra if Cobra Commander interferes with Blitz's mission, but the Commander does not seem intimidated. =Spy Troops and Valor vs. Venom= Cobra Commander appeared in the direct-to-video CGI animated movies G.I. Joe: Spy Troops and G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom, voiced by Michael Dobson. =G.I. Joe: Resolute= In the miniseries, Cobra Commander is portrayed in a darker incarnation than the one in Sigma 6, revealing the attributes of cowardice and hysterics to have been only a mask for weeding out traitors and such among his organization, as well as to motivate his followers to think for themselves. He executes a plan to achieve world dominion through the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program with a prototype particle beam weapon to hold the world hostage. He is portrayed as utterly ruthless, casually destroying all of Moscow just to demonstrate the beam's power to the United Nations and killing anyone in his organization who shows incompetence or threatens his command, such as Sebastian Bludd. Over the course of the story, the Commander becomes more unhinged as his scheme unravels and his underlings are killed/captured, choosing to strike cities randomly instead of waiting for the United Nations to respond to his demands. Ordering his troops to defend the Springfield base where he has hidden himself, Cobra Commander slaughters his control team for the particle superweapon and takes shelter in a bunker as Duke arrives to disable the weapon, now aimed at the U.S. capital. As he gloats about his victory, Duke recalibrates the weapon to fire at Springfield instead, and Cobra Commander desperately tries to escape the nigh- indestructible bunker that Duke had forced shut as Springfield is decimated. Despite this, Cobra Commander was found to be missing from said bunker when Duke made a return to the site. Cobra Commander was voiced by Charlie Adler. =G.I. Joe: Renegades= In the series G.I. Joe: Renegades, Cobra Commander is reinterpreted as a corporate businessman known as Adam DeCobray, CEO of the legitimate Cobra Industries, a multinational conglomerate which serves as a front for his terrorist organization. He is egotistical, but nowhere as arrogant and pompous in his promotional speechmaking as some of his other incarnations. Suffering an disfiguring terminal condition that resorts to him wearing a full breathing mask covered by plastic shielding wrap, Cobra Commander is forced to appear to the public as a normal-looking virtual simulation over video screens with only a few like Baroness knowing of his true appearance. Only Doctor Mindbender knows the full truth of his condition as Cobra Commander funds the scientist's research in hopes to achieve immortality. Charlie Adler reprises the role of Cobra Commander for this series. While he is more ruthless and less incompetent than his previous versions, Cobra Commander still has an affinity for large and expensive schemes such as building a transcontinental, maglev train network to move weapons and resources across the country, the Bio-Viper soldiers, and later the M.A.S.S. teleportation device. He doesn't participate in field work, carrying out most of his day-to-day activities from a high-tech bunker located under his mansion. Sigma 6 In G.I. Joe: Sigma 6, Cobra Commander's profile has been modified, stating that he considers himself a warrior king. This rendition of the character possesses snake-like eyes as well as full battle armor. He wears a helmet that resembles a snake's head and covers his face with a hood. The snake staff he carries contains a number of hidden weapons systems. In the Sigma 6 animated series, the Commander was voiced by Marc Thompson. At the series conclusion, most of Cobra has been captured but Cobra Commander and Firefly are still at large. Sigma 6 figures were heavily stylized with help by the Japanese animation company Gonzo. The Cobra Commander was released in the \\"Commando\\" collection in a new 8\\" scale, in 2006. Wearing body armor and a cape, the Commander still donned his iconic hood with a battle helmet on top of it. As an action figure, Cobra Commander had a spinning wheel built into his chest, which registered battle damage if hit. A repaint of this figure, without the battle-damage feature and new weapons, was released in black and silver. A second, more radical repaint followed in 2007, with the Commander's armor painted silver, and an air chariot included as an accessory. The Commander was also released in the 2.5\\" line, initially as part of the \\"B.A.T. Attack\\" figure 4-pack. A second version was included with the H.I.S.S. Tank. Live action film Cobra Commander appears in the movie G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra played by Joseph Gordon- Levitt. Gordon-Levitt wore a mask and prosthetic makeup underneath. Upon seeing concept art of the role he was being offered, Gordon-Levitt signed on because; \\"I saw the designs and drawings of the way they interpreted my character for this movie - the costume, the whole getup - and I was like, 'Oh, wow. I get to be that guy? Fantastic. Sign me up. Please. Thank you.'\\" Gordon- Levitt described his vocal performance as being half reminiscent of Chris Latta's voice for the 1980s cartoon, but also half his own ideas, because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous. The hood was not used in the movie, due to concerns that it would resemble the hood used by the KKK. For most of the movie, he is referred to as The Doctor, a scientist working with James McCullen concerning his research on nanomites. It is revealed that he was Rexford G. \\"Rex\\" Lewis, the younger brother of Ana Lewis, and once a soldier alongside Duke. Rex was presumed dead, after a building Duke sent him into was hit with a premature air strike called in by Duke. But prior to the explosion, Rex saw McCullen's early experimental research on nanomites conducted by Doctor Mindbender, and was in awe of the sight. Surviving the incident, yet scarred both physically and mentally; requiring a special mask to breathe, Rex learns from Mindbender and perfects the nanomites. He uses his own sister as a test subject in creating the Neo-Vipers, making her an agent known as the Baroness. He carries a deep grudge against Duke for leaving him to die. When Duke is captured, Rex reveals himself, as he attempts to subject Duke to the nanomites and make him one of his Neo-Viper soldiers. But the Baroness overcomes her programming and saves Duke, while Rex escapes with a badly burned McCullen. Rex uses specially made nanomites to heal McCullen's face, which also encases it in a living, silver-like metal. Dubbing him \\"Destro\\", Rex puts on a new breathing mask and tells McCullen to call him Commander. Although he is arrested and placed in a high security prison aboard the USS Flagg, Cobra Commander's master plan had only begun, with Zartan disguised as the President of the United States. Cobra Commander returns in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, played by Australian actor Luke Bracey and voiced by Robert Baker. Director Jon Chu suggested in a March 2012 interview that this Cobra Commander is not the same character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in The Rise of Cobra, but in May 2012 confirmed that the Cobra Commander of Retaliation is indeed still Rex Lewis. He features an altered appearance from the first film, more similar to his helmeted look from the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero cartoon. In the movie, Cobra Commander has been transferred from the FLAGG to another high-security prison in Germany alongside Destro, where he is being force-fed a paralyzing drug whilst floating in a water chamber. He is soon broken out by Storm Shadow and Firefly, but Destro is left behind and Storm Shadow is injured as the base is destroyed. After sending Storm Shadow off to the Himalayas to heal, Cobra Commander retreats to his own base of operations, where he meets with Zartan (still disguised as the President). They develop Project Zeus, a super weapon, which uses kinetic bombardment and targets several prominent cities. Cobra Commander demonstrates the magnitude of the weapon's power in front of the world's leaders by demolishing London. The Joes are able to stop Cobra Commander before he unleashes the full power of Zeus, but the terrorist leader escapes after the deaths of Zartan and Firefly as well as the betrayal of Storm Shadow. Cobra Commander will be appearing in G.I. Joe: Ever Vigilant for a cameo. Video games Cobra Commander is one of the featured villains in the 1985 G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero computer game. Cobra Commander appeared as the final boss in the 1991 G.I. Joe video game, in 1992's G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Konami's G.I. Joe arcade game. In the video game G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, he is the fourth and final boss, who is fought towards the end of the \\"Cobra Base\\" act. Joseph Gordon-Levitt reprises his role. Other works Cobra Commander's figure is briefly featured in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures to set up a battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. As he imagined the characters in his head, he observed the \\"core of Cobra Command\\" atop an oak toy chest, high above the thick shag carpet, and \\"the hooded Cobra Commander, looking like a blue klansman, was loading his black laser pistol and making small talk with Destro\\". The commander's business ventures and identity issues are discussed in the non- fiction book Powerplay. His works with secret bases is discussed in the paperback Saturday Morning Fever. His general background is examined in the non-fiction The End of Victory Culture. The merits of Destro versus Cobra Commander is discussed by Iraqi soldiers in the autobiography by veteran Matt Gallagher. References External links * Cobra Commander at JMM's G.I.

He is best known for writing for British television comedies such as The Fast Show, and for being a guitarist in Del Amitri between 1989 and 1995. He was educated at Collyer‚Äôs School and the University of East Anglia, where he earned a degree in English & American Studies. It was while studying at the UEA that he met Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson, who later went on to create The Fast Show. At this time, however, Higson was mostly interested in music, and Cummings was a founder member of his band, The Higsons, who gained some cult popularity at the time. After graduating from University, Cummings moved to London, where he continued playing guitar, notably in the legendary, but unsigned, cult band Bonsai Forest featuring Paul Whitehouse on lead guitar. In 1989 he joined the Scottish group Del Amitri after the departure of their guitarist Mick Slaven, being pictured on the cover of the 1990 album Waking Hours even though he joined after the material had already been recorded. Cummings played on the next two Del Amitri albums, Change Everything in 1992 and Twisted in 1995, as well as on various tours, including an appearance at Woodstock '94. However, at the end of their United States tour of 1995, which saw them riding on the crest of a top ten hit there with the song Roll to Me, Cummings decided to leave the band. He thought all the touring might put a strain on his marital life, and his departure is documented - and somewhat dramatised - on the band's tongue-in-cheek 1996 tour diary video release Let's Go Home. Even before his departure from the band, since 1994 Cummings had begun to move into scriptwriting, working with Whitehouse on material for comedian Harry Enfield's Harry Enfield and Chums sketch show broadcast on BBC One. His friendship with Whitehouse and Higson led to Del Amitri appearing in an episode of their BBC Two sketch show The Fast Show in 1995, and after his departure from the band Cummings turned full- time to television scriptwriting. As well as continuing to write for The Fast Show until its conclusion in 2000, Cummings co-wrote with Whitehouse the sitcom Happiness (BBC Two, 2000‚Äì01) and the feature film Kevin and Perry Go Large, which was a spin-off from Harry Enfield and Chums. In 2014, he appeared in The Life of Rock with Brian Pern as John, the bassist of the fictional prog rock band Thotch. In 2015, he helped co-write Paul Whitehouse's sitcom Nurse, based on his Radio 4 show of the same name, which debuted on BBC 2 on 10 March.

In the United States he is best known for his work with writer Brian Azzarello on the Vertigo title 100 Bullets, while in Argentina and Europe he is noted for his collaborations with Ricardo Barreiro and Carlos Trillo. He has received much acclaim for his work. He is the main creator of the popular Argentine comic convention Crack Bang Boom; a massive event which is held annually in the city of Rosario and is considered as the most important of its type in South America. Biography Risso was born in Leones in C√≥rdoba Province, Argentina, and started as a cartoonist in 1981, drawing his first collaborations for the morning newspaper La Naci√≥n and the magazines Erotic√≥n and Satiric√≥n, all published by Editorial Columba. In 1986, he worked for Eura Editoriale of Rome, Italy, and in 1987 he drew Parque Chas, scripted by Ricardo Barreiro. The series was first published by Fierro in Argentina and then by Totem in Spain, Comic Art in Italy and finally the complete series as an album in France, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. In 1988, he drew Cain, again scripted by Barreiro. Later that same year, Risso drew Ful√π, scripted by Carlos Trillo, published in Italy, France, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, and in Argentina in the Puertitas magazine. The Trillo-Risso duo also created Simon: An American Tale, published in Italy and France, Borderline, published in Italy and Chicanos, published in Italy and France. Risso and writer Brian Azzarello launched the 100 Bullets series for Vertigo in August 1999. Azzarello and Risso collaborated on several Batman stories as well including \\"Broken City\\" in Batman #620‚Äì625 (December 2003 ‚Äì May 2004); a Batman serial for Wednesday Comics #1‚Äì12 (2009); and the Flashpoint: Batman Knight of Vengeance limited series in 2011.Manning \\"2010s\\" in Dougall (2014), p. 318: \\"In this powerful reimagining of the Batman legend, writer Brian Azzarello and artist Eduardo Risso joined forces for a three‚Äìissue examination of Flashpoint's Batman.\\" Other projects from the team include Spaceman and the 100 Bullets: Brother Lono limited series.

Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1‚Äì2% of the original caffeine content, and sometimes as much as 20%. Decaffeinated products are commonly termed decaf. Decaffeination of coffee Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge performed the first isolation of pure caffeine from coffee beans in 1820, after the poet Goethe heard about his work on belladonna extract, and requested he perform an analysis on coffee beans. Though Runge was able to isolate the compound, he did not learn much about the chemistry of caffeine itself, nor did he seek to use the process commercially to produce decaffeinated coffee. = Decaffeination processes = Various methods can be used for decaffeination of coffee. These methods take place prior to roasting and may use organic solvents such as dichloromethane or ethyl acetate, supercritical CO2, or water to extract caffeine from the beans, while leaving flavour precursors in as close to their original state as possible.  Organic solvent processes  = Direct method = The first commercially successful decaffeination process was invented by German merchant Ludwig Roselius and co-workers in 1903, after Ludwig observed that a freight of coffee beans accidentally soaked in sea water had lost most of their caffeine content without losing much of their flavour. The process was patented in 1906, and involved steaming coffee beans with various acids or bases, then using benzene as a solvent to remove the caffeine. Coffee decaffeinated this way was sold as Kaffee HAG after the company name Kaffee Handels-Aktien-Gesellschaft (Coffee Trading Company) in most of Europe, as Caf√© Sanka in France and later as Sanka brand coffee in the US. Caf√© HAG and Sanka are now worldwide brands of Kraft Foods. 1914 American newspaper advert for Kaffee HAG decaffeinated coffee Methods similar to those first developed by Roselius have continued to dominate, and are sometimes known as the direct organic solvent method. However, because of health concerns regarding benzene (which is recognised today as a carcinogen), commercial processes now instead use alternative solvents such as dichloromethane or ethyl acetate.Ronald Clarke and O.O. Vizthum Coffee: Recent Developments. Blackwell Science 2001, p. 109. The unroasted (green) beans are first steamed and then rinsed with the solvent which extracts the caffeine, while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the US standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass per the EU standard). = Indirect method = Another variation of Roselius' method is the indirect organic solvent method. In this method, instead of treating the beans directly, they are first soaked in hot water for several hours - in essence making a strong pot of coffee - then removed, and the remaining water is treated with solvents (e.g. dichloromethane or ethyl acetate) to extract the caffeine from the water. As in other methods, the caffeine can then be separated from the organic solvent by simple evaporation. The same water is recycled through this two-step process with new batches of beans. An equilibrium is reached after several cycles, wherein the water and the beans have a similar composition except for the caffeine. After this point, the caffeine is the only material removed from the beans, so no coffee strength or other flavourings are lost. Because water is used in the initial phase of this process, indirect method decaffeination is sometimes referred to as \\"water- processed\\". This method was first mentioned in 1941, and people have made great efforts to make the process more \\"natural\\" and a true water-based process by finding ways to process the caffeine out of the water in ways that circumvents the use of organic solvents.Ronald Clarke and O.O. Vizthum Coffee: Recent Developments. Blackwell Science 2001, p. 111.  Swiss Water process  Sack of green coffee beans decaffeinated by the Swiss Water process An alternative method for removal of caffeine from coffee is the Swiss Water process. This process uses no organic solvents, and instead only water is used to decaffeinate beans, a technique first developed in Switzerland in 1933, and commercialised by Coffex S.A. in 1980. The Swiss Water process was then introduced by The Swiss Water Decaffeinated Coffee Company of Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, in 1988.History of the SWISS WATER Decaffeination Process , Jan 04, 2007 The process uses Green Coffee Extract (GCE) for the caffeine extraction mechanism. Green Coffee Extract is a solution containing the water- soluble components of green coffee except for the caffeine, obtained by soaking green coffee beans in hot water, then filtering through an activated charcoal filter to remove the caffeine molecules. Fresh beans containing both caffeine and the other components are added to the GCE solution, where the gradient pressure difference between the GCE (which is caffeine-lean) and the green coffee (which is caffeine-rich) causes the caffeine molecules to migrate from the green coffee into the GCE. Because GCE is saturated with the other water-soluble components of green coffee, only the caffeine molecule migrates to the GCE; the other water-soluble coffee elements are retained in the green coffee. The newly caffeine-rich GCE solution is then passed through the activated carbon filters to again remove the caffeine, and the process is repeated. The continuous batch process takes 8‚Äì10 hours to meet the final residual decaffeinated target. Noted food engineer Torunn Atteraas Garin also developed a process to remove caffeine from coffee.  Triglyceride process  Green coffee beans are soaked in a hot water/coffee solution to draw the caffeine to the surface of the beans. Next, the beans are transferred to another container and immersed in coffee oils that were obtained from spent coffee grounds and left to soak. After several hours of high temperatures, the triglycerides in the oils remove the caffeine, but not the flavor elements, from the beans. The beans are separated from the oils and dried. The caffeine is removed from the oils, which are reused to decaffeinate another batch of beans. This is a direct-contact method of decaffeination. Supercritical CO2 process Food scientists have also turned to supercritical carbon dioxide as a means of decaffeination. Developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Planck Institute, it uses CO2, heated and pressurised above its critical point, to extract caffeine. In this process, green coffee beans are steamed and then added to a high pressure vessel. A mixture of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) is circulated through the vessel at 300 atm and 65 ¬∫C (150¬∞F). At this temperature and pressure CO2 is a supercritical fluid, with properties midway between a gas and a liquid. Caffeine dissolves into the CO2; compounds contributing to the flavour of the brewed coffee are largely insoluble in CO2 and remain in the bean. In a separate vessel, caffeine is scrubbed from the CO2 with additional water. The CO2 is then recirculated to the pressure vessel. = Caffeine content of coffee = = Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee = To ensure product quality, manufacturers are required to test the newly decaffeinated coffee beans to make sure that caffeine concentration is relatively low. A caffeine content reduction of at least 97% is required under United States standards. There is less than 0.1% caffeine in decaffeinated coffee and less than 0.3% in decaffeinated instant coffee in Canada. To do so, many coffee companies choose to employ high- performance liquid chromatography to quantitatively measure how much caffeine remains in the coffee beans. However, since HPLC can be quite costly, some coffee companies are beginning to use other methods such as near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Although HPLC is highly accurate, NIR spectroscopy is much faster, cheaper and overall easier to use. Lastly, another method typically used to quantify remaining caffeine includes ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy, which can be greatly advantageous for decaffeination processes that include supercritical CO2, as CO2 does not absorb in the UV-Vis range. A controlled study of ten samples of prepared decaffeinated coffee from coffee shops showed that some caffeine remained. Fourteen to twenty cups of such decaffeinated coffee would contain as much caffeine as one cup of regular coffee. The 473 ml (16 ounce) cups of coffee samples contained caffeine in the range of 8.6 mg to 13.9 mg. In another study of popular brands of decaf coffees, the caffeine content varied from 3 mg to 32 mg.\\"Are You Really Getting Caffeine-Free Decaf Coffee?\\" Independent research on 10 popular decaffeinated coffees. Viewed Aug 05, 2008 A 237 ml (8 ounce) cup of regular coffee contains 95‚Äì200 mg of caffeine,\\"Caffeine Content for Coffee, Tea, Soda, and More\\" List of caffeine content in beverages known to contain caffeine. Viewed Aug 28, 2012 and a 355 ml (12 ounce) serving of Coca-Cola contains 36 mg.\\"Caffeine Amounts in Soda: Every Kind of Cola You Can Think Of\\" List of caffeine content in popular soft drinks. Viewed Aug 28, 2012 Both of these studies tested the caffeine content of store-brewed coffee, suggesting that the caffeine may be residual from the normal coffee served rather than poorly decaffeinated coffee.  Decaffito  As of 2009, progress toward growing coffee beans that do not contain caffeine was still continuing. The term \\"Decaffito\\" has been coined to describe this type of decaffeinated coffee, and trademarked in Brazil. The prospect for Decaffito-type coffees was shown by the discovery of the naturally caffeine- free Coffea charrieriana, reported in 2004. It has a deficient caffeine synthase gene, leading it to accumulate theobromine instead of converting it to caffeine. Either this trait could be bred into other coffee plants by crossing them with C. charrieriana, or an equivalent effect could be achieved by knocking out the gene for caffeine synthase in normal coffee plants.  Decaffeinated tea  Tea may also be decaffeinated, usually by using processes analogous to the direct method or the CO2 process, as described above. The process of oxidizing tea leaves to create black tea (\\"red\\" in Chinese tea culture) or oolong tea leaves from green leaves does not affect the amount of caffeine in the tea, though tea-plant subspecies (i.e., Camellia sinensis sinensis vs. Camellia sinensis assamica) may differ in natural caffeine content. Younger leaves and buds contain more caffeine per weight than older leaves and stems. Although the CO2 process is favorable because it is convenient, nonexplosive, and nontoxic, a comparison between regular and decaffeinated green teas using supercritical carbon dioxide showed that most volatile, nonpolar compounds (such as linalool and phenylacetaldehyde), green and floral flavor compounds (such as hexanal and (E)-2-hexenal), and some unknown compounds disappeared or decreased after decaffeination. In addition to CO2 process extraction, tea may be also decaffeinated using a hot water treatment. Optimal conditions are met by controlling water temperature, extraction time, and ratio of leaf to water, where higher temperatures at or over 100 ¬∞C, moderate extraction time of 3 minutes, and a 1:20 leaf to water weight per volume ratio removed 83% caffeine content and preserved 95% of total catechins. Catechins, a type of flavanols, contribute to the flavor of the tea and have been shown to increase the suppression of mutagens that may lead to cancer. Both coffee and tea have tannins, which are responsible for their astringent taste, but tea has a nearly three times smaller tannin content than coffee. Thus, decaffeination of tea requires more care to maintain tannin content than decaffeination of coffee in order to preserve this flavour. Preserving tannins is desirable not only because of their flavor, but also because they have been shown to have anticarcinogenic, antimutagenic, antioxidative, and antimicrobial properties. Specifically, tannins accelerate blood clotting, reduce blood pressure, decrease the serum lipid level, and modulate immunoresponses. Certain processes during normal production might help to decrease the caffeine content directly, or simply lower the rate at which it is released throughout each infusion. Several instances in China where this is evident is in many cooked pu-erh teas, as well as more heavily fired Wuyi Mountain oolongs; commonly referred to as 'zhonghuo' (mid-fired) or 'zuhuo' (high-fired). A generally accepted statistic is that a cup of normal black (or red) tea contains 40‚Äì50 mg of caffeine, roughly half the content of a cup of coffee. Although a common technique of discarding a short (30 to 60 seconds) steep\\"FAQ at imperial tea court\\", www.imperialtea.com, 2002 is believed to much reduce caffeine content of a subsequent brew at the cost of some loss of flavor, research suggests that a five-minute steep yields up to 70% of the caffeine, and a second steep has one-third the caffeine of the first (about 23% of the total caffeine in the leaves).

He came to prominence with the hardboiled crime series 100 Bullets, published by DC Comics' mature-audience imprint Vertigo. In 2011, he became the writer of DC's relaunched Wonder Woman series. Early life Azzarello grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where his mother managed a restaurant his father was a salesman. As a child, he read monster and war comic books, but avoided the superhero genre. He attended the Cleveland Institute of Art, where he studied painting and printmaking. After several years of working various blue-collar jobs, he moved to Chicago in 1989. After his move to Chicago, Azzarello became interested in the work of Black Lizard Press, a small publishing house which reprinted hardboiled detective and noir fiction. In Chicago, Azzarello met his future wife, artist Jill Thompson, then working for Vertigo (a comic book imprint of DC Comics). She also liked monster movies, and she was impressed by a werewolf story Azzarello had written. She introduced him to Lou Stathis, an editor at Vertigo who wanted to move away from the light fantasy Vertigo was publishing. He hired Azzarello as a writer. Career Brian Azzarello was the line editor for Andrew Rev's incarnation of Comico. Azzarello's first published comics work was \\"An Undead Evolution\\", a text article in Cold Blooded #1 (May 1993) published by Northstar. His first story for DC Comics was \\"Ares\\" which appeared in Weird War Tales vol. 2 #1 (June 1997). He and artist Eduardo Risso launched the 100 Bullets series for Vertigo in August 1999. In addition to 100 Bullets, Azzarello has written for Batman (\\"Broken City\\"; Batman/Deathblow: After the Fire; Joker; and Flashpoint: Batman Knight of VengeanceManning \\"2010s\\" in Dougall (2014), p. 318: \\"In this powerful reimagining of the Batman legend, writer Brian Azzarello and artist Eduardo Risso joined forces for a three-issue examination of Flashpoint's Batman.\\"), Hellblazer and Superman (\\"For Tomorrow\\" and Lex Luthor: Man of Steel). In 2003, upon being assigned to write both the Batman and Superman titles, Azzarello told the Chicago Tribune, \\"DC is giving me the keys to both cars in the garage, the Maserati and the Ferrari...Somebody told me, 'Don't drive drunk.'\\" Mark Waid's and Alex Ross' 1996 miniseries Kingdom Come features a character named \\"666\\", who is physically modeled after Azzarello. In 2005, Azzarello began a new creator- owned series, the western Loveless, with artist Marcelo Frusin. Also at Vertigo, his Filthy Rich original graphic novel was one of the two titles that launched the Vertigo Crime line. Azzarello and Risso produced a Batman serial for Wednesday Comics in 2009. He designed the First Wave, a new fictional universe for DC Comics, separate from the main DC Universe. It started with a Batman/Doc Savage one-shot, followed by the First Wave limited series. In 2011 he began writing The New 52 relaunch of the Wonder Woman series, collaborating with artist Cliff Chiang. He wrote two Before Watchmen limited series featuring the Comedian and Rorschach. In 2014, he and Jeff Lemire, Keith Giffen, and Dan Jurgens co-wrote The New 52: Futures End. In April 2015 he was announced as the co-writer of an eight-issue second sequel to The Dark Knight Returns, titled The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, with Frank Miller. The series was released twice-monthly starting in late 2015. Andy Kubert and Klaus Janson were the artists on the series. In 2016 Azzarello wrote the 12-issue miniseries Moonshine with frequent collaborator Eduardo Risso for Image Comics. Azzarello and artist Lee Bermejo collaborated on the Batman: Damned limited series for DC's Black Label imprint. =Influences= Azzarello cites Jim Thompson and David Goodis among his influences.

Adam A500 during flight test at the Mojave Spaceport Adam A500 The M-309 CarbonAero technology demonstrator at Mojave The Adam A500 is an American six-seat civil utility aircraft that was produced by Adam Aircraft Industries. The aircraft is of pod-and-boom, push-pull configuration with its two Continental TSIO-550-E piston engines mounted to provide centerline thrust. Design and development The A500 was developed from the M-309 CarbonAero technology demonstrator designed by Burt Rutan and built by Scaled Composites at the Mojave Airport. The \\"309\\" designation refers to this being Rutan's 309th aircraft design. The 309 first flew in March 2000, but the aircraft has since been gutted and was used as a static display outside the Adam Aircraft Industries headquarters.Adam M-309 article summary In 2006 the 309 was loaned to the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum and is now on display. Compared to conventional twin-engine installations, the centerline thrust arrangement reduces drag and maximizes the controllability of the aircraft should one engine malfunction or fail. This engine configuration was used by the similar Cessna Skymaster. The A500 airframe is largely built of carbon fiber epoxy composite materials with a Nomex honeycomb core. Other features include cabin pressurization. The prototype A500 first flew on July 11, 2002, and was FAA certified in May 2005. Adam Aircraft ceased operations on 11 February 2008, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on 19 February 2008, having delivered seven A500s. In April 2008 Adam Aircraft was purchased from bankruptcy by AAI Acquisition Inc. At the time of purchase this new company indicated that they would pursue certification of the A700 jet as a priority and that the A500 would not be produced due to the continuing poor market for piston-engined aircraft. AAI went out of business in April 2009 without producing any aircraft. In July 2009 there was an indication that a new buyer, Thomas Hsueh of Triton America based at Skagit Regional Airport in Burlington, Washington, was interested in purchasing the A500 design and returning the aircraft to production. In April 2011 Triton Aerospace announced that they had acquired the assets of Adam Aircraft including the aircraft type certificate and intend to return the A500 to production. In April 2011 Triton Aerospace announced that they will redesign the aircraft using what Thomas Hsueh, owner of Triton Aerospace, termed \\"proper engineering\\" to shed of empty weight and recertify it with the intention of putting it back into production. The aircraft will also be changed to a turboprop, with twin engined and rear- engined-only versions. A new prototype was expected in 2013 with re- certification to follow. Hsueh indicated that for now production is planned for the US, but costs may require moving the assembly line to China or even a lower cost country such as Mexico. By 2013 the Triton website had been taken down and the URL sold. It is likely that the company has gone out of business. =A500 payload issues= In evaluation flights conducted in 2007 the A500 was noted as being over the projected empty weight by or 30%.MacClellan, J.

He was the 2nd Baron Altrincham from 1955 until he disclaimed that title under the Peerage Act on the day it received the Royal Assent in 1963. Grigg edited the National and English Review (1954‚Äì1960) as his father had done. He was a liberal Tory but was defeated at the 1951 and 1955 general elections. In an article for the National and English Review in August 1957, Grigg argued that Queen Elizabeth II's court was too upper-class and British, and instead advocated a more \\"classless\\" and Commonwealth court. His article caused a furore and was attacked by the majority of the press, with a minority, including the New Statesman and Ian Gilmour's The Spectator, agreeing with some of Grigg's ideas. He left the Conservative Party for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1982. Early years Born in Westminster, Grigg was the son of Edward Grigg, and his wife, Joan Dickson-Poynder. Edward Grigg was a Times journalist, Conservative MP, Governor of Kenya, and member of Winston Churchill's wartime government. From Eton, Grigg joined the British Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into his father's regiment, the Grenadier Guards, in 1943 during the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945). While in the British Army, Grigg served as an officer of the Guard at St James's Palace and Windsor Castle, Berkshire, and saw action as a platoon commander in the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards, part of the 5th Guards Armoured Brigade of the Guards Armoured Division, against the German Army in France and Belgium. Towards the end of the war, he became an intelligence officer. After the war, Grigg read Modern History at New College, Oxford. While at Oxford University, he gained a reputation for academic excellence, winning the University Gladstone Memorial Prize in 1948. In the same year, after graduating with second-class honours,Geoffrey Wheatcroft, ‚ÄòGrigg, John Edward Poynder, second Baron Altrincham (1924‚Äì2001)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2005; online edn, Jan 2011 Grigg joined the National Review, which was owned and edited by his father. Political career A liberal Tory, and later a supporter of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, Grigg sought election to the House of Commons. He stood for election for the recently created Oldham West at the 1951 general election, but was defeated by the sitting member Leslie Hale. Grigg contested the seat again in the 1955 general election but was similarly unsuccessful. With his father's death in December 1955, Grigg inherited the title of Baron Altrincham, which seemingly ended any hope of him being able to stand again as a candidate. Nonetheless, Grigg refused to apply for a writ of summons, abjuring his right to a seat in the House of Lords. When Tony Benn (the Viscount Stansgate) succeeded in obtaining passage of the Peerage Act, Grigg was the second person (after Benn himself) to take advantage of the new law and disclaim his peerage. In 1997, he wrote that he was \\"entirely opposed to hereditary seats in Parliament\\" and added that at that time in 1963 he \\"felt honour-bound to disclaim, though it was a bore to have to change my name again\\". Grigg never achieved his ambition of election to the Commons, and he subsequently left the Conservative Party for the SDP in 1982.  Journalism  As his father's health failed during the first few years of the 1950s, Grigg assumed most of the managerial and editorial duties of the now-renamed National and English Review. By the time of his father's death in December 1955, Grigg had taken over the editorship formally, and began to edit the Review into a publication more reflective of his views. In 1956, Grigg attacked Anthony Eden's Conservative government for its handling of the Suez Crisis, and pressed for an immediate withdrawal of British forces from Port Said. He followed his father in championing reform of the House of Lords, although he added that, in lieu of reform, abolition might be the only alternative. He also advocated the introduction of women priests into the Anglican Church. = Monarchy = In an August 1957 article, \\"The Monarchy Today\\", Grigg argued that the court of Queen Elizabeth II was too upper-class and British, and instead advocated a more \\"classless\\" and Commonwealth court. More personally, he attacked the Queen's style of public speaking as \\"a pain in the neck\\": > \\"Like her mother, she appears to be unable to string even a few sentences > together without a written text ‚Äì a defect which is particularly regrettable > when she can be seen by her audience.\\" Grigg also criticised the Queen's speeches, normally written for her by her advisers: > \\"The personality conveyed by the utterances which are put into her mouth is > that of a priggish schoolgirl, captain of the hockey team, a prefect, and a > recent candidate for Confirmation.\\" Grigg's article caused a furore and was attacked by the majority of the press, with a minority agreeing with some of his opinions. Henry Fairlie of the Daily Mail accused Grigg of \\"daring to pit his infinitely tiny and temporary mind against the accumulated experience of centuries\\". Baron Beaverbrook's Daily Express defended the Queen, and condemned Grigg's article as a \\"vulgar\\" and \\"cruel\\" attack. Ian Gilmour's The Spectator, whilst agreeing with Grigg's view that the Monarchy leant too heavily on the upper class, accused him of \\"monarcho-mysticism\\": exaggerating the influence of the Monarchy, and seeking to elevate the Queen to the position of a \\"life-force\\". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, also attacked Grigg. Whilst the BBC censured his views on the Monarchy, Grigg was invited by Granada Television to discuss his article with Robin Day on the programme Impact. As he was leaving Television House having given the interview, a member of the League of Empire Loyalists came up to him and slapped his face, saying: > \\"Take that from the League of Empire Loyalists.\\"'Ld. Altrincham Slapped', > The Times (7 August 1957), p. 8. The man, Philip Kinghorn Burbidge, was fined 20 shillings and said: > \\"Due to the scurrilous attack by Lord Altrincham I felt it was up to a > decent Briton to show resentment. What I feared most was the overseas > repercussions and publication in American newspapers. I thought our fortunes > were at a low ebb and such things only made them more deplorable.\\" Burbidge added that the court fine was the best investment he had ever made.'Lord Altrincham's Assailant Fined', The Times (8 August 1957), p. 3. Robert Menzies, prime minister of Australia, was publicly critical of Grigg, describing his article as \\"disgusting and shocking criticism\\": > \\"I think it a very great pity...that it should have been lifted out of a > journal with not a very great circulation and given an audience of many > millions in the world Press. I think the Queen performs her duties in the > Royal office with perfection...If it is now to be said that she reads a > speech I might say that many of the great statesmen in the world will have > to face the same charge and had better be criticised for it.\\" Grigg responded, by attacking Menzies for his \\"disgusting\\" and \\"stuffily subservient\\" attitude towards the Queen, in a front-page interview with the Melbourne Herald: > \\"Mr Menzies ... is typical of the very worst attitude towards the Crown. He > simply blindly worships the Sovereign as someone above criticism...puts her > on a pedestal and genuflects.\\" Grigg alleged that Menzies had given the Queen poor advice during her 1954 tour of Western Australia, when there had been a mild epidemic of poliomyelitis. He said that the risk of the Queen catching polio was minute, when compared to that for the thousands of people who crowded into the streets to see her, but that: > \\"...as a result of Mr Menzies advice, the Queen did not shake hands with > anyone during the entire visit. She remained remote, aloof and isolated > without contact with the people. Bouquets brought to her by little children > were taken by her ladies-in-waiting and then thrown in dustbins. The Queen > did not spend one night on Western Australian soil and ate only food brought > from the liner Gothic. I feel that if the situation was put to her properly > she would have seen that it wasn't the way a Sovereign acts\\". Grigg's comments were widely reported across the world. He recorded an interview for Path√© News, reiterating his criticism of the Queen's speeches: > \\"I feel her own natural self is not allowed to come through: it's a sort of > synthetic creature that speaks ‚Äì not the Queen as she really is.\\" Grigg also received police protection for his appearance on another Granada broadcast, Youth Wants To Know: this time from Granada Studios in Manchester. During the broadcast, he criticised the Queen for taking what he considered to be too many holidays. The Daily Express, having earlier attacked Grigg for his article, began itself to criticise Royal procedure; although it did not criticise the Queen herself. Reynold's News praised Grigg for \\"saying out loud what many people are thinking\\". Kingsley Martin's New Statesman said Grigg had broken the unassailable Fleet Street law: > \\"...that the Queen is not only devoted, hardworking and young ‚Äì but also a > royal paragon of wit, wisdom and grace.\\" Grigg always contended that his criticism was meant as constructive, from one who was a reformer and who was a strong believer in constitutional monarchy: > \\"It is too precious an institution to be neglected. And I regard servile > acceptance of its faults as a form of neglect.\\" Grigg also commented specifically of the Queen: > \\"She will know that it is easier to be polite to those in high places than > to tell them hard truths in a straightforward manner... Wherever she goes, > she has the power to help people and to make them happy, simply by being > herself. She does not have to pretend to be a Queen: she is the Queen. And > the perfect modern Queen is no haughty paragon, but a normal affectionate > human being, sublimated through the breadth and catholicity of her > experience and the indestructible magic of her office.\\" Speaking some decades on, Grigg clarified: > \\"I was rather worried by the general tone of comment, or the absence of > comment really in regards to the monarchy ‚Äì the way we were sort of drifting > into a kind of Japanese Shintoism, at least it seemed to me, in which the > monarchy was not so much loved as it should be and cherished, but worshipped > in a kind of quasi-religious way. And criticism of the people who were > actually embodying it at the time was completely out.\\" In spite of the initial backlash, several of Grigg's recommended reforms for making the monarchy more relevant were accepted by the Royal Household, after Grigg's meeting with Martin Charteris, the Queen's assistant private secretary. Debutantes' Parties were ended in 1958, whilst the Queen received help in order to improve her diction before making her Christmas Speech in December 1957. During a meeting at Eton College some decades later, Charteris praised Grigg for his article: > \\"You did a great service to the monarchy, and I'm glad to say so publicly.\\" = After 1960 = The National and English Review closed in June 1960, with its 928th and last issue. At the same time, Grigg started working at The Guardian, which had just relocated to London from its original home in Manchester. For the rest of the decade he wrote a column, entitled A Word in Edgeways, which he shared with Tony Benn. Work as a biographer and historian At that same time, in late 1960s, Grigg turned his attention to the project that would occupy him for the remainder of his life: a multi- volume biography of the British prime minister David Lloyd George. The first volume, The Young Lloyd George, was published in 1973. The second volume, Lloyd George: The People's Champion, which covered Lloyd George's life from 1902 to 1911, was released in 1978 and won the Whitbread Award for biography for that year. In 1985 the third volume, Lloyd George, From Peace To War 1912‚Äì1916, was published and subsequently received the Wolfson prize. When he died in 2001 Grigg had nearly completed the fourth volume, Lloyd George: War Leader, 1916‚Äì1918; the final chapter was subsequently finished by historian Margaret MacMillan (Lloyd George's great-granddaughter) and the book published in 2002. In all the volumes, Grigg showed a remarkable sympathy, and even affinity, for the \\"Welsh Wizard\\", despite the fact that their domestic personalities were very different. Historian Robert Blake judged the result to be \\"a fascinating story and is told with panache, vigour, clarity and impartiality by a great biographer.\\"Blake, Robert (28 October 2002). The Evening Standard. Grigg also wrote a number of other books, including: Two Anglican Essays (discussing Anglicanism and changes to the Church of England), Is the Monarchy Perfect? (a compendium of some of his writings on the Monarchy), a biography of Nancy Astor; Volume VI in the official history of The Times covering the Thomson proprietorship; and The Victory that Never Was, in which he argued that the Western Allies prolonged the Second World War for a year by invading Europe in 1944 rather than 1943. Personal life Grigg married Belfast native Patricia Campbell, who worked at National and English Review, on 3 December 1958 at St Mary Magdalene Church, Tormarton, Gloucestershire. They later adopted two boys.\\"2nd Baron Altrincham weds Patricia Campbell\\" alamy.com retrieved April 27, 2017\\"Altrincham, Baron (UK, 1945)\\" Cracroft's Peerage retrieved April 27, 2017 In popular culture Grigg is portrayed by John Heffernan in the Netflix series The Crown.

She was built in 1992 in Brodosplit, Croatia as Frans Suell for service with Euroway. Between 1994 and 1997 she sailed as Silja Scandinavia for Silja Line. Gabriella has sister ships Amorella in Viking Line fleet, Isabelle operated by Tallink, and a third one, Crown Seaways, operated by DFDS Seaways. Concept and construction Euroway was a concept developed during the latter half of the 1980s by the Sweden-based Sea-Link Shipping. The new brand was planned to operate two state-of-the-art cruiseferries between Malm√∂ in Sweden and L√ºbeck in Germany via Travem√ºnde in Germany, with the service aimed in particular at conference groups. Sea-link decided to order the ships from Brodosplit in Croatia, which at that time still was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The ships were based on the same design as the Amorella and Isabella that had been built by the same shipyard for the Finland-based SF Line for Viking Line traffic in 1988 and 1989, respectively. The Euroway sisters were designed with a somewhat different layout of public spaces and cabins, as well as an additional cabin deck. The order for the first ship, Frans Suell, was placed on 28 September 1989, with the delivery date projected in mid-1991. The ship was launched on 23 January 1991, but due to the Croatian War of Independence her construction was severely delayed, and she was not ready for her first sea trials until January 1992. Following her second sea trials in March 1992 Frans Suell sailed to Rijeka for finalization of her construction and to receive the Euroway livery. The ship was finally delivered to her owners on 4 May 1992 and left Split for Malm√∂. Service history =1992‚Äì1994: Frans Suell= On 16 May 1992 Frans Suell was christened in Malm√∂ by the Swedish opera singer Birgit Nilsson. The following day she set on her maiden voyage from Malm√∂ to Travem√ºnde and L√ºbeck, with only invited guests on board. On 19 May 1992 she began normal service on the Malm√∂‚ÄìTravem√ºnde route, with a daily departure from both ports. The service had a troubled start, as marketing had been difficult due to delays in the construction of the ship. Due to restrictions placed by the city of Malm√∂ on traffic through the city, no trucks could be carried on board, and operating the buffet restaurant on board caused difficulties for the company. From 1 September 1992 onwards Frans Suell's route was extended to L√ºbeck for the duration of the northern hemisphere winter season. The call at Travem√ºnde was maintained as the city of L√ºbeck did not allow cars to be unloaded in the city. Due to the longer crossing times the timetable was altered with departures from every second day from Malm√∂ and L√ºbeck, with overnight crossings. On 1 June 1993 Sea-Link Shipping entered an agreement with Silja Line, with the latter assuming marketing and operational responsibility of the Euroway service and ships. The service now became marketed as Silja Line Euroway, with Silja Festival joining Frans Suell as the second ship on the service (the original planned second ship, Frans Kockum, had been even more severely delayed than Frans Suell, and eventually Sea-Link cancelled the order). From the beginning of June 1993 Frans Suell (and Silja Festival)'s route was again shortened to Malm√∂‚ÄìTravem√ºnde, with two daily departures from both ports. With hopes of attracting more passengers, for the 1993‚Äì1994 winter season the route was extended into Copenhagen‚ÄìMalm√∂‚ÄìTravem√ºnde‚ÄìL√ºbeck from 1 September 1993 onwards, with daily departures from Copenhagen and L√ºbeck. Due to the low passenger figures on the service and the poor financial situation of Silja Line, the decision was made to terminate the Euroway service on 12 March 1994. Silja Line wished to charter Frans Suell for use on their Turku‚ÄìStockholm service, and already on 2 March 1994 she had been chartered to Silja. =1994‚Äì1997: Silja Scandinavia= Following the closure of Euroway Frans Suell sailed to the Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki, Finland, where she was fitted with rear sponsons, refurbished, painted in Silja Line livery and renamed Silja Scandinavia. On 31 March 1994 she entered service on the Turku‚ÄìStockholm route. Silja Line's main rivals Viking Line, who owned two of the ship's sisters, were also interested in chartering the ship but thought the price was too high. As Silja Line's charter agreement for Silja Scandinavia was drawing to a close in 1996, the main funders of Sea-Link demanded that instead of continuing the charter the ship should be sold to the highest bidder. Although Silja Line would have wanted to continue operating the ship, the company was in such a poor financial condition that it could not pay the price asked for the ship. Instead, she was sold to Viking Line on 11 November 1996, with the delivery date planned in April 1997.Malmberg, Stampehl (2007). p. 165. On 4 April 1997 Silja Scandinavia arrived for the last time in Turku in Silja Line colours. Gabriella in Helsinki, May 1997. Note the all-red funnel and white-painted car ramps =1997 onwards: Gabriella= After ending her service with Silja Line, Silja Scandinavia again sailed to the Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki, where she was delivered to Viking Line, refurbished, repainted and renamed Gabriella (the name having been chosen by a public naming competition). On 17 April 1997, Gabriella entered service for her new owners on the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm route. On 30 June 1999 the a call at Mariehamn was added to the service to maintain tax free sales on board. In 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 the ship spent brief periods sailing on Turku‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm route, in place of the ship normally used in the service. On 23 January 2004 she collided with the harbour ferry Ehrensv√§rd in the Helsinki harbour, resulting in minor damage to both ships. Between 5 May 2008 and 27 May 2008, Gabriella was rebuilt at √ñresundsvarvet in Landskrona, Sweden, as a part of Viking Line's fleet rebuilding programme. The refit included the removal of the original cafeteria from deck 7 in favour of expanding the tax-free shop, the addition of a games room on deck 7, the addition of a Tapas & Wine restaurant on deck 8, the conversion of the former BBQ-restaurant into an Ella's restaurant, the conversion of the two-storey discoth√®que on decks 9 and 10 into a new cafeteria, the addition of new cabins in place of the former conference rooms on deck 11, and redecoration of the majority of passenger cabins.

The aircraft was developed in parallel with the generally similar Adam A500, although while that aircraft is piston-engined, the A700 is powered by two Williams FJ33 turbofans. The two models have about 80% commonality. The prototype A700 first flew on July 28, 2003. Two conforming prototypes were built. Development Adam Aircraft ceased operations on 11 February 2008 and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation on 19 February 2008, prior to the certification or delivery of any production A700s. In April 2008 Adam Aircraft was purchased from bankruptcy by AAI Acquisition Inc who have indicated their intention to continue with certification of the aircraft. Industrial Investments, the Russian company that purchased Adam Aircraft, restarted work on the A700 and in May 2008 had 60 employees back at work. Industrial Investments reportedly ordered 75 A700s prior to Adam Aircraft's bankruptcy. AAI had initially intended to certify the A700 in the first quarter of 2010, but citing the economic crisis of 2008 President and CEO Jack Braly announced on 28 October 2008 that \\"Flight test and other development activity have been suspended\\". Braly indicated that the company's investment team and board of directors are reviewing the economic and market conditions and will decide on a new schedule for certifying the A700. The Federal Aviation Administration accepted the previous certification data that Adam Aircraft recorded, which would have greatly simplified certification efforts by the new company, however in April 2009 Adam Aircraft ceased operations and laid off all its staff, ending development of the A700. In April 2011 Triton Aerospace, the new holder of the type certificate, indicated that they will concentrate of the A500 and have no plans to continue development of the A700, even though they have two disassembled examples. Design Diagram showing the external centerline fuel tank on the aircraft As with the earlier-designed A500 piston-engined model, the A700 featured a straight tapered wing, a central fuselage, and twin wing- mounted booms which supported aft twin rudders linked by a high horizontal stabilizer. Unlike on the A500, the A700's two engines were mounted on the sides of the fuselage, in a non-centerline thrust arrangement, eliminating one of the design advantages of the A500 configuration. In order to balance the twin rear-mounted engines properly, the forward fuselage was lengthened by 4 feet. In the A500, the front engine is balanced by the rear engine and empennage. In the A700, the longer front fuselage balances the rear engines and empennage.

The busiest days of the festival are Wednesday, when the Galway Plate is held, and Thursday, when the Galway Hurdle and Ladies' Day take place. Festival history The first racing festival held in Ballybrit was a two-day event with the first race meeting on Tuesday, 17 August 1869. The summer festival was extended to a 3-day meeting in 1959, 4 days in 1971, 5 days in 1974, 6 days in 1982 and, most recently to, 7 days in 1999. The summer festival is the highlight of the business year for most local businesses as crowds and horses flock from all over the world to attend one of the world's biggest race meetings. Jockey and horses preparing for the races.The pub underneath the Corrib Stand, built in 1955, was for many years the longest bar in the world. It was replaced by the Millennium Stand which opened in 1999. The Killanin Stand opened in 2007 replacing the old Corrib (west) Stand. On the 4th day of the Galway races there was a race meeting held in Tuam. The last race meeting held at Tuam racecourse was in 1973. Additional race meetings also take place in September and October, but these are not as popular as the summer festival, which draws more than 150,000 spectators.

Donna Troy, the original Wonder Girl, was created by Bob Haney and Bruno Premiani and first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #60 (June/July 1965). The second Wonder Girl, Cassie Sandsmark, was created by John Byrne and first appeared in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #105 (January 1996). Both are prot√©g√©es of Wonder Woman and members of different incarnations of the Teen Titans. The alias has also been used in reference to a younger version of Wonder Woman as a teenager. An original version of Wonder Girl named Drusilla appeared in the Wonder Woman television series, played by Debra Winger. Donna Troy makes her live adaptation debut in the DC Universe series Titans, played by Conor Leslie. Fictional character biographies =Diana= Although not named Wonder Girl, a young Wonder Woman appeared as part of the character's origin story in All-Star Comics #8 (December 1941), Wonder Woman's first appearance. A teen-aged Princess Diana of the Amazons was featured in a backstory in Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #23 (May/June 1947), written by William Moulton Marston and designed by H.G. Peter. Wonder Girl first appeared in The Secret Origin of Wonder Woman, written and edited by Robert Kanigher, in Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105 (April 1958). In this revised Silver Age origin, it is established that Diana had in fact not been created from clay, but had been born before the Amazons settled on Paradise Island. Following this issue were several Wonder Girl adventures, and years later an additional character, Wonder Tot‚ÄîWonder Woman as a toddler‚Äîwas also featured. Kanigher restored the character's made-from-clay origin in 1966. From Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #124 (August 1961) onward, Wonder Woman, Wonder Girl, and Wonder Tot frequently appeared together in stories that were labeled \\"impossible tales\\", presented as films made by Wonder Woman's mother, Queen Hippolyta, who had the power to splice together films of herself and Diana at different ages. The characters of Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman then began to diverge, as Bob Haney wrote Wonder Girl stories that took place in the same time period as those of Wonder Woman. The last significant appearance of Wonder Woman as a child Wonder Girl was in November 1965. In the tongue-in- cheek Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #158, the aforementioned Kanigher broke the fourth wall by having Wonder Girl and the rest of the supporting cast he had created (Wonder Tot, the Glop, Bird-Boy, Mer-Boy, Birdman, and Manno) come to the office of a \\"certain\\" editor. Protested by fans for ruining the character, Kanigher tells Wonder Girl that he does love her, along with all of his other daughters, such as Black Canary, Star Sapphire, and the Harlequin. Even so, with mounting pressure, he has no choice but to declare her retconned. Wonder Girl stoically accepts her fate as she and the others turn into drawings on Kanigher's desk. Soon after, Wonder Woman enters and is shocked to see her younger self \\"killed\\". Regardless, Diana as a child Wonder Girl was never completely rejected. Reprints of Wonder Girl stories were occasionally included in the comic book. In issue #200, Wonder Woman, in her Diana Prince identity, is shown walking past children at play whereon she flashes back to when she was a fourteen-year-old Wonder Girl with a crush on Mer-Boy. =Donna Troy= While the characters of Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman were diverging, Haney was developing a new group of junior superheroes, whose first informal appearance featured a team-up of Robin (Dick Grayson), Kid Flash (Wally West), and Aqualad (Garth). During their next appearance in The Brave and the Bold #60 (July 1965), they were dubbed the Teen Titans and joined by Wonder Girl, pictured in the same frame as Wonder Woman and calling Hippolyta \\"mother\\". Wonder Girl and the other Teen Titans were then featured in Showcase #59 (December 1965) before being spun off into their own series with Teen Titans (vol. 1) #1 (February 1966). With the character called only Wonder Girl, or \\"Wonder Chick\\" by her teammates, her status as either the younger Wonder Woman displaced in the timeline or another character altogether is not explained until Teen Titans (vol. 1) #22 (August 1969). In a story by Marv Wolfman and Gil Kane it is established that Wonder Girl is a non-Amazon orphan, rescued by Wonder Woman from an apartment building fire. Unable to find any parents or family, Wonder Woman brings the child to Paradise Island, where she is eventually given Amazon powers by the Purple Ray. The story ends with Wonder Girl wearing a new costume and hairstyle, adopting the secret identity Donna Troy. Multiple origins As special event comics like the Crisis on Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis miniseries have rewritten character histories, the origin of Donna Troy has been revised several times. In brief, those origins are as follows: # Rescued orphan: Donna Troy was rescued from an apartment building fire by Wonder Woman, who took her to Paradise Island to be raised as an Amazon by Queen Hippolyta. # Titan Seed: The Titan Rhea had rescued a young Donna from a fire, adding her to a group of 12 orphans from around the universe who had been raised on New Cronus by these Titans as \\"Titan Seeds\\", their eventual saviors. The Seeds had been given superhuman powers and named after ancient Greek cities. Called \\"Troy\\", Donna (like the others) had eventually been stripped of her memories of her time with the Titans of Myth, and reintroduced into humankind to await her destiny. In this version, Donna was not an Amazon and had no connection to Wonder Woman.The New Titans #50-54 (December 1988 ‚Äì March 1989) # Infinite Lives of Donna Troy: In a revision that incorporated the Titan Seed continuity while reattaching Donna Troy to Wonder Woman, it is revealed that the Amazon sorceress Magala had animated a mirror image of young Princess Diana to create for her a mystical, \\"identical twin\\" playmate. This twin is soon mistaken for Diana and kidnapped by Dark Angel (revealed in the Return of Donna Troy mini-series to be the Donna Troy of Earth 7). Dark Angel disperses the girl's spirit across the multiverse, condemning her to live multiple lives, each one cut short by the Dark Angel at a moment of tragedy.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #131-136 (March ‚Äì August 1998) In at least one of these variant lives, Donna would become a superhero and encounter her grown sister, now Wonder Woman, and their mother Queen Hippolyta, without realizing who she really was or how she was related to them. After that timeline ends with the death of Donna's son, Diana and Hippolyta intervene to find what happened to Donna. Donna finally defeats Dark Angel, destroying the evil entity and regaining her original Amazon powers. She returns to reality to continue her life from that point.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #136 (August 1998) # Pre Flashpoint version: Wonder Woman (vol. 3) Annual #1 gives Donna a new origin that combines elements of her three variant origins. Donna was born as Princess Diana's mystic twin through the help of Amazon sorceress Magala. Months later, an old enemy of Queen Hippolyta, called Dark Angel, kidnapped Donna thinking she was Diana. Donna was placed in suspended animation by Dark Angel for years but was eventually rescued and returned to the Amazons' home, where she received training from both the Amazons and the Titans of Myth and was raised as Queen Hippolyta's second daughter. Years later, she followed Wonder Woman into the outside world as Wonder Girl and helped form the Teen Titans.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) Annual #1 # Rebirth: It is revealed that Donna was created out of clay as part of a plan to destroy Wonder Woman but the Amazons gave her false memories of being an orphan rescued by Wonder Woman allowing her to live a normal life.Titans Annual #1 (May 2017) =Cassandra Sandsmark= Cover to Teen Titans #35 (2006). Art by Tony Daniel. Cassie Sandsmark is the daughter of Dr. Helena Sandsmark, an archaeologist, and Zeus. She has been a member of both Young Justice and the Teen Titans. Initially, her powers were derived from ancient Greek magical artifacts. Later, Zeus granted her the boon of actual powers. Her powers are similar to Wonder Woman's, though she carries a lasso that expels Zeus's lightning, which was given to her by her half-brother, Ares, the Greek god of war. When the Greek gods left the mortal plane during Infinite Crisis, Zeus stripped Cassie of her powers. However, she was granted powers by Ares in exchange for becoming his champion. After Superboy's death, she quit the Titans for a time to be an independent vigilante. She was mourning the loss of her lover, Superboy, and bitter from the abandonment by Robin and Wonder Woman over the following year. She later rejoined the group after a battle with the Brotherhood of Evil and the return of Cyborg. She is close friends with fellow hero Supergirl. Alternate versions =Tiny Titans= Both Donna and Cassie have a recurring roles in the Tiny Titans comic by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani. The two are depicted as cousins, with the Wonder Girl alias given to Donna and Cassie being referred to by her first name.\\"Tiny Titans\\" #1 =Superman & Batman: Generations= In Superman & Batman: Generations #2, Wonder Girl first appears in 1953 as a \\"mystic projection\\" to take Wonder Woman's place while Diana gives birth. She finds a wounded Steve Trevor and takes him back to Paradise Island, but despite being subjected to the Purple Power Ray, he dies of his wounds, leaving Diana to raise their daughter, Stephanie, alone. In 1964, Stephanie (or \\"Stevie\\") decides to go out on her own as Wonder Girl. She shares a link with Supergirl (Kara Kent), as they were born at the same time. Years later, she becomes the new Wonder Woman. Her outfit is pretty much the same as her mother's, except that she does not possess either the tiara or the Magic Lasso of Aphrodite, instead possessing the winged sandals of Hermes. She also wears a mask. When she becomes the new Wonder Woman, she adds a cape to the ensemble. In Superman & Batman: Generations #3, she is killed by Darkseid. =Earth-2= Another version of Donna exists in the New 52 on the alternate Earth-2. In Earth-2: Society, the character, Fury, reveals her name is Donna. This character is the daughter of the late Earth-2 Wonder Woman and the New God, Steppenwolf. This is the first time Fury is used as a doppelganger of Donna Troy and not just an analogue. =DC Comics Bombshells= In the DC Comics Bombshells universe, Wonder Girl is not a single person, but rather a team of young Asian-American girls who are empowered by the mystical artifacts formerly used by Wonder Woman. The Wonder Girls consist of Donna Troy (a Nisei Japanese-American), Cassie Sandsmark (a mixed-race girl of partial Japanese heritage), Yuki and Yuri Katsura, and Emily Sung.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian- america/wonder-woman-confronts-japanese-american-internment-dc-s-bombshells- united-n795176 =Injustice= In the comic tie-in to Injustice: Gods Among Us, Cassie is with the Titans when the Joker's nuclear bomb goes off. Her attire is similar to that of Wonder Woman's in the game. She is sent to spy on Conner after he is devastated by Superman's actions to see what he's up to, and finds him at the Fortress of Solitude trying to find the Phantom Zone Projector. She and the other Titans try to help Conner stop Superman, but Superman mortally wounds him. She and the Titans are sent to the Phantom Zone by Superman to save Conner's life and to stop them from interfering with Superman's plans. In the prequel to Injustice 2, they are freed from the Phantom Zone thanks to the Insurgency. As evidenced during their fight with Amazo, her relationship to her mentor, Wonder Woman, is strained due to the latter allying with the Regime (Though Diana is still concerned for Cassie's well-being and had no idea about Superman sending the Titans to the Phantom Zone). In other media =Television= Animated * Donna Troy appears as Wonder Girl in the Teen Titans segments of The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure, voiced by Julie Bennett. * The second animated appearance of Donna Troy as Wonder Girl was in the ultra-rare 1984 \\"New Teen Titans Say No to Drugs\\" public service announcement. This would be the only animated version of the second incarnation of the Teen Titans produced by Hanna- Barbera. The New Teen Titans in the commercial included Wonder Girl, Raven, Starfire, Kid Flash, Cyborg, Changeling and The Protector (from the anti-drug comic book). Robin was omitted due to licensing rights. * In the episode \\"Paradise Lost\\" from the first season of the Justice League animated series, Wonder Woman saves a young blonde girl from a tree. When Wonder Woman returns the girl to her mother, the mother calls the girl \\"Cassie\\". This is an obvious reference to Wonder Girl from the comics. * In the fifth season of Teen Titans, a girl bearing a resemblance to the Donna Troy version of Wonder Girl ‚Äì a brunette with star-shaped earrings ‚Äì is seen briefly in episodes \\"Homecoming: Part II\\" and \\"Calling All Titans\\". Retrieved on January 1, 2009. * Donna Troy as Wonder Girl appears as one of the lead characters in Super Best Friends Forever, a series of animated shorts for Cartoon Network's DC Nation block, voiced by Grey DeLisle. She also makes a cameo in DC Nation's New Teen Titans short \\"Kids Korner 4 Kids\\", in which she appears with the other Titans in a game where the viewer has to find Beast Boy. * Donna Troy as Wonder Girl makes a nonspeaking cameo in a DC Super Friends short. * Cassie Sandsmark as Wonder Girl appears in the Young Justice: Invasion episode \\"Happy New Year\\", voiced by Mae Whitman. She is introduced as a member of the Team's Beta Squad alongside Batgirl where they first appear to fight Lobo who was targeting U.N. Secretary General Tseng (who was actually an alien in disguise). In \\"Alienated\\" Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman were part of Delta Squad during the mission to stop the Kroloteans on Malina Island. They both took out multiple Mechs. When they learned the base was set to explode, she and the team retreated to the Bio-Ship. In \\"Beneath\\" she, Miss Martian, Bumblebee, and Batgirl liberated a group of abductees guarded by Mammoth, Icicle Jr., Devastation, Shimmer, and Psimon in Bialya. In \\"Before the Dawn\\", Wonder Girl and Alpha Squad followed a Manta-Flyer from Star City to the Reach's headquarters to rescue their captured teammates and other abductees. The operation was cut short by a Reach enforcer, who Wonder Girl dubbed as \\"Black Beetle\\". As he overpowered and easily defeated the team one by one, Cassie contacted the other heroes for help. Black Beetle pinned her against the door, and mercilessly slammed her into it repeatedly until she was down. Blue Beetle, Beast Boy and Impulse arrived. While Blue Beetle held off the Black Beetle, Impulse and Beast Boy helped the team aboard the Bio-Ship and escaped. Wonder Girl and Tim Drake became a couple shortly after the Reach invasion concluded. Wally West's death was the catalyst in giving Wonder Girl the courage to kiss him. In Young Justice: Outsiders, she tries patch things up with Tim Drake after he leaves the Team and becomes a member of the Batman Inc. Later in the season, she helps found the Outsiders (alongside Beast Boy, Blue Beetle, Static, Geo-Force, and Bart Allen). Donna Troy (as Troia) was set to appear in Young Justice as a former member of the Team from the five year gap between seasons 1 and 2. She was meant to be included in the episodes \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Endgame\\", but her planned cameo was scrapped in both instances. Donna debuts in the third-season episode \\"Royal We\\" as an ambassador for Themyscira at the UN alongside Garth of Atlantis, and goes on to appear in \\"Influence\\" and \\"Elder Wisdom\\", with Grey DeLisle reprising her role. * Donna Troy appears in Teen Titans Go!, voiced by Hynden Walch. In the June 2019 episode \\"The Bergerac\\", the Titans give Robin advice to guide him through his camp romance with Wonder Girl. Live-action Debra Winger as Wonder Girl. * In 1976, a version of Wonder Girl appeared in the Wonder Woman television series and was played by Debra Winger, in one of her first mass- media roles. The actress Charlene Tilton, best known for playing Lucy Ewing in the television series Dallas, auditioned for the part of Wonder Girl but lost it to Winger. The pilot episode revealed that Wonder Woman's alter-ego, Princess Diana of Paradise Island, was Queen Hippolyta's daughter, but later episodes featured Diana's younger sibling, Drusilla. Drusilla first appeared in the two-part episode The Feminum Mystique. In that episode, Queen Hippolyta (Carolyn Jones) sends Drusilla to America in order to bring Diana home to Paradise Island. (Queen Hippolyta is never referred to by name in any of the televised specials in which she appeared.) Drusilla gets tangled up in a Nazi plot to discover the secret of Wonder Woman's bracelets, which can deflect bullets, and in the process Drusilla masters the spinning transformation used by her older sister. Although Drusilla creates the persona of Wonder Girl, the distinction is lost on the Nazis, who believe her to be Wonder Woman and abduct her. In the second part of this episode, Drusilla returns to Paradise Island to help free her fellow Amazons from a Nazi overtaking. Drusilla appeared again in another episode, the final episode of the first season, entitled Wonder Woman in Hollywood. On September 3, 1993, Winger appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote her film Wilder Napalm. There, Winger revealed she was contracted a position as a regular on the show and even the lead in a Wonder Girl spinoff TV show. She wanted off the show and had her agent get her out of her contract. Letterman then showed the audience a short clip of Winger as Wonder Girl and asked several questions about the show and co-star Lynda Carter. Winger briefly feigned embarrassment, but then claimed she was late for something she had to do, then surprisingly tore off her dress to reveal a Wonder Girl costume underneath. Winger ran through the audience to exit the theater, while the Wonder Woman theme song's bass line played. Clip In the comics, Drusilla is a regular amazon who appears in Wonder Woman #182, 1969 who was an ally to Wonder Woman. A figure resembling Winger's Drusilla made a cameo appearance in Infinite Crisis #6, as the Wonder Girl of Earth-462. Cassandra Sandsmark would later adapt the alias of Drusilla to protect her identity. * Donna Troy appears in the DC Universe series Titans, portrayed by Conor Leslie. Introduced in the episode \\"Donna Troy\\", this version of Donna is an investigative photojournalist who was the childhood best friend of Dick Grayson and former sidekick of Wonder Woman. In the present day, Dick seeks Donna's assistance in translating an ancient text which reveals Koriand'r's mission to kill Rachel Roth in order to thwart her destiny to destroy the world. Dick and Donna save Rachel from a remorseful Starfire, and the group moves to confront Rachel's demon father, Trigon. =Film= * Donna Troy makes a nonspeaking cameo as Wonder Girl during the epilogue of Justice League: The New Frontier alongside the other original Teen Titans, Supergirl, and Black Canary. * A Crime Syndicate of America version of Wonder Girl named Olympia appeared in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, she is an amalgamation of Wonder Girl and Olympian. * Cassie Sandsmark makes a cameo appearance in the DC animated movie, Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. She is shown eating dinner behind the table of Superman and Wonder Woman. When Cyborg and Shazam come to fetch them via boom tube, Cassie stands up and exclaims, \\"I love you, Shazam!\\" She is apparently wearing a Shazam T-shirt. * The Young Justice version of Cassie Sandsmark, along with Artemis, Zatanna, and Miss Martian, makes a cameo appearance as home viewers in Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery.http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2014/03/25/young- justices-brandon-vietti-pairs-scooby-doo-wwe-hints-at-dc-return/ * Donna also makes a nonspeaking cameo in the ending of Teen Titans: The Judas Contract as the newest member of the Teen Titans who replaces the deceased Terra. She flies in the sky and almost falls. While Beast Boy cannot say anything, he hints that she's a \\"wonderful\\" new member of their team before giving his big speech about Terra to Kevin Smith. * Donna appears as one of the many superheroes wandering around the Warner Brothers lot without any speaking roles in Teen Titans Go! to the Movies. =Video games= * Donna Troy appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Deena Hyatt.

Cassie Sandsmark also appears in issue #54, where she is depicted as the head of her high school's Wonder Woman fan club. Her obsession leads her to steal two mystical artifacts that grant her superpowers, after which she barges into an athletic tournament on Paradise Island set up by Donna Troy to see which of the world's young female heroes might be able to replace her as Wonder Woman's partner. Cassie initially plans to defeat Donna one-on-one to become the new Wonder Girl, but winds up helping her save Paradise Island from an invasion by the undersea villain Trident instead. At the issue's end, Donna offers Cassie a chance to join the Titans' worldwide training program, once her mother was through punishing her for stealing the artifacts.

It is one of the northern islands in the Kvarner Gulf and can be reached via ferry from Rijeka, the island Krk or from the Istrian peninsula (line Brestova-Porozina). With an area of 405.78 km2, Cres is the same size as the neighbouring island of Krk, although Krk has for many years been thought the largest of the islands. Cres has a population of 3,079 (2011). Cres and the neighbouring island of Lo≈°inj once used to be one island, but were divided by a channel and connected with a bridge at the town of Osor. Cres's only fresh water source is the Lake Vrana. History Cres has been inhabited since the Paleolithic time period. Its name predates classical antiquity and is derived from Proto-Indo-European *(s)quer- (\\"cliff\\"). Although this is one view, another more historically correct is from classical antiquity, when the town was founded and inhabited by ancient Greeks, and called it Chersos (ŒßŒ≠œÅœÉŒøœÇ); \\"chersos\\" in Greek means \\"barren land\\", \\"uncultivated land\\" and \\"dry heaths\\". Later, \\"Chersos\\" was resounded to \\"Cresta\\", from which eventually the modern name \\"Cherso-Cres\\" is derived. Cres was later ruled by the Greeks and, since the 1st century B.C., the Roman Empire make province of Liburnia. After the fall of the Roman Empire the island was taken over and became a part of the Byzantine Empire, and remained this way for centuries. Slavics came to the islands in the early 9th century (believed to be somewhere around 812). Then, around 866 the romans inhabitants saw the first conflicts with the Republic of Venice. The Venetians eventually took control of Cres and the neighboring islands in the 10th and 11th centuries. However, in the islands is being ruled for 400 years the Venetians took control. After Napoleon's victory over the Venetians, the island came under Austrian rule. After the defeat of Austria by Napoleon in 1809 the islands became part of the French Empire. After the fall of Napoleon, Austria once again took control of the island for 100 years. During this time the economy developed with olive trees, sage, and other plants becoming key to the success of the island. At the end of World War I, with the Treaty of Rapallo signed in 1920, the island was once again handed over to Italy.http://www.istrapedia.hr/hrv/816/rapalski-ugovor/istra-a-z/ This lasted until 1947 when the Islands, along with Istrian Peninsula, were assigned to Yugoslavia. The island has gone through an agricultural downturn as many residents left the island in search of a better life on the mainland and abroad. This has resulted in many former agricultural areas becoming overgrown with local vegetation. Recently people, primarily retirees, have been returning to live on the island. Tourism has become an increasingly important industry and the population experiences significant seasonal variation. Towns of Cres The island has several villages, all of them connected by a road that runs down the middle of the island. On one side is the ferry from the mainland (to the city of Pula); on the other is the bridge to Lo≈°inj (Lussino), which was once connected by land but is now separated by a waterway. Approaching the island from Pula, you will first come to Porozina. Lubenice Beach A list of the villages with descriptions is below: * Porozina ‚Äì A small village comprising the ferry terminal and a few shops. * Beli ‚Äì This small village, at the end of a long and very narrow road, is home to a famed bird species, the endangered Griffon vulture. * Cres * Orlec ‚Äì Another small village at the end of a narrow road, also home to the endangered vulture. * Valun ‚Äì Visible on the way to Lubenice (see below), this village does not permit cars. A fee is charged for parking. * Lubenice ‚Äì An ancient mountain village with a great view of the sea and neighboring islands. A restaurant and bar operate during the warmer months. Weekly musical concerts take place during the peak tourist season. Stivan Beach * Belej * Stivan ‚Äì On a side street this small hamlet of 16 people features a very private beach, old houses and a church, and is on the way to other villages. *Merag -with ferry connections. * Mihola≈°ƒáica (it.: San Michele, St. Michael)- A small village with a church which shares the same name as the community. Tourism has grown here since the arrival of the Zaglav community nearby. * Martin≈°ƒáica (it.: San Martino in Valle, St. Martin in the Valley) ‚Äì The home of a large vacation complex, Slatina, along with beaches and cafes. * Osor (it.: Ossero)- A town on the \\"border\\" between two islands. Founded by the Romans who also dug the channel thus dividing what was then known as the Osor island into Cres and Lo≈°inj. Then a major port and commercial centre started to fade with coming of larger ships that could not pass the narrow channel or dock in the shallow port. * Pernat ‚Äì The westernmost village on Cape Pernat. A quaint and rustic village forming a gateway to numerous walking trails and secluded beaches. * Podol ‚Äì Between Lubenice and Valun. A tiny hamlet that resembles a large farmhouse. Its key feature is the mulberry tree located in the middle of the road. * Punta Kriza (it.: Punta Croce) ‚Äì The southernmost part of Cres. FKK resort is here. * Vidovici ‚Äì A short distance uphill from Martin≈°ƒáica. A village with an extraordinary view of the Istrian Peninsula and numerous islands including Zeƒça, Lo≈°inj and Unije forming part of the archipelago. A restaurant operates in the evenings during the warmer months. Lake Vrana Lake Vrana. Cres has its own fresh water lake, which is very highly guarded and illegal to swim or fish in. It supplies water to neighboring Lo≈°inj (it. Lussino) as well. It is the largest lake in Croatia by volume and one of the deepest fresh water lakes in Eastern Europe, going down 76 meters at its deepest point (>50 m below sea-level). Flora and fauna Cres is home to many different types of nonvenomous snakes, including Elaphe quatuorlineata, Zamenis longissimus, Zamenis situla, and Natrix tessellata, a snake rare or absent on other Adriatic islands. The island has a relatively large breeding population of the endangered Eurasian griffon vulture, which can often be seen soaring over the island.  Climate  The main part of Cres features a mid- latitude humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen : Cfa), with Bora wind under the K√∂ppen climate classification. Only Lo≈°inj island enjoys a true hot-summer mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen : Csa). References * \\"Cres and Losinj: Strolling through the islands and islets\\" Nadir Mavrovic, Nerezine 1997.

A Christian name, sometimes referred to as a baptismal name, is a religious personal name historically given on the occasion of a Christian baptism, though now most often assigned by parents at birth. In English-speaking cultures, a person's Christian name is commonly their first name and is typically the name by which the person is primarily known. Traditionally, a Christian name was given on the occasion of Christian baptism, with the ubiquity of infant baptism in medieval Christendom. In Elizabethan England, as suggested by William Camden, the term Christian name was not necessarily related to baptism, used merely in the sense of \\"given name\\": Christian names were imposed for the distinction of persons, surnames for the difference of families. In more modern times, the terms have been used interchangeably with given name, first name and forename in traditionally Christian countries, and are still common in day-to-day use. Strictly speaking, the Christian name is not merely the forename distinctive of the individual member of a family, but the name given to the person (generally a child) at their christening or baptism. In pre-Reformation England, the laity was taught to administer baptism in case of necessity with the words: \\"I christen thee in the name of the Father\\" etc. To \\"christen\\" in this context is therefore to \\"baptise\\", and \\"Christian name\\" means \\"baptismal name\\". Origin In view of the Hebrew practice of giving a name to the male child at the time of his circumcision on the eighth day after birth (Luke 1:59), it has been maintained that the custom of conferring a name upon the newly baptised was of Apostolic origin. For instance, the apostle of the Gentiles was called Saul before his conversion and Paul afterwards. But modern scholars have rejected this contention, since the baptism of St. Paul is recorded in Acts 9:18, but the name Paul does not occur before Acts 13:9 while Saul is found several times in the interval. There is no more reason to connect the name Paul with the Apostle's baptism than there is to account in the same way for the giving of the name Cephas or Peter, which is due to another cause. In the inscriptions of the Catacombs of Rome and in early Christian literature, the names of Christians in the first three centuries did not distinctively differ from the names of the pagans around them. A reference to the Epistles of St. Paul indicates that the names of pre-Christian gods and goddesses were used by his converts after their conversion as before. Hermes occurs in Romans 16:14, with a number of other purely pagan names, Epaphroditus in Phil. 4:18, Phoebe, the deaconess, in Romans 16:1. Similar names are found in the Christian inscriptions of the earlier period and in the signatories appended to such councils as Nicaea or Ancyra,see Turner, \\"Eccl. Occident. Mon. Juris\\", I, 36-90; II, 50-53 or again in the lists of martyrs. At a later date the names are of a most miscellaneous character. The following classification is one that has been worked out by J. Bass Mullinger founded on Martigny. =Names without Christian origin and significance= This category may be divided as follows: * derived unchanged or but slightly modified from pagan mythology, e.g., Mercurius, Bacchus, Apollos (I Corinthians 16:12), Hermogenes (Romans 16:4), etc. * from religious rites or omens, e.g., Augustus, Auspicius, Augurius, Optatus; * from numbers, e.g., Primus, Primigenius, Secundinus, Quartus, Octavia, etc. * from colours, e.g., Albanus, Candidus, Rufus, etc. * from animals and birds, e.g., Agnes, Asellus, Columbia, Leo, Taurus, Ursula, etc. * from agriculture, e.g., Agricia, Armentarius, Palmatinus, Stereorius, etc. * from flowers, e.g., Balsamia, Flosculus, Narcissus, Rosula; * from jewels, e.g., Chrysanthus, Margarites, Smaragdus; * from military life or the sea, e.g., Emerentiana, Navigia, Pelagia, Seutarius, Thalassus; * from countries, cities, rivers etc.; Afra, Cydnus, Galla, Jordanis, Macedonius, Maurus, Sabina, Sebastianus, etc. * from the months e.g., Aprilis, Januaria, Junia, etc. * from personal qualities, etc., e.g., Aristo, Hilarius, Modestus, Pudens, etc.; * from servile condition, e.g., Servus, Servilianus, Vernacla; * names of historical celebrity, e.g., Caesarius, Cornelia, Pompeius, Ptolemaeus, Vergilius =Names with Christian origin and significance= These include the following: * apparently suggested by Christian dogmas, e.g. Anastasia, Athanasia, Christophorus, Redemptus, Restitutus, etc. * from festivals or rites, e.g., Epiphanius, Eulogia, Natalis, Pascasia, Sabbatius and the frequently recurring Martyrius; * from Christian virtues, e.g., Agape, Elpis, Fides, Irene, with such derivatives as Adelphius, Agapetus, Caritosa, etc. * pious sentiment, e.g., Adeodata, Ambrosius, Benedictus, Deogratias, etc., and possibly such names as Gaudentianus, Hilarius, Sozomen, Victorianus, Vincentius Though the recurrence of such names as Agnes, Balbina, Cornelius, Felicitas, Irenaeus, Justinus, etc. may be due to veneration for the martyrs who first used these names, the names of the New Testament are rarely found while those of the Old Testament are more common. Susanna, Daniel, Moyses, Tobias, occur frequently, but towards the end of the 4th century the name of the Blessed Lady becomes as familiar as those of the Apostles. Paulus may be an intentional reference to St. Paul, and Johannes, Andreas, and Petrus with derivatives such as Petronia, Petrius, Petronilla, etc. may also refer to the Apostles. The name of Mary occurs occasionally in the catacomb inscriptions towards the end of the 4th century, for example, in the form LIVIA MARIA IN PACE,De Rossi, \\"Rom. Sot.\\", I, 143 and there is a martyr Maria assigned to the date AD 256.De Rossi, \\"Rom. Sot.\\" III, 200 sqq. and compare other instances of the name, De Rossi, \\"Insc. Christ. I, 331; II, 160 and 173 Change of name at baptism In the Acts of St. Balsamus, who died AD 331, there is an early example of the connection between baptism and the giving of a name. \\"By my paternal name\\", this martyr is said to have declared, \\"I am called Balsamus, but by the spiritual name which I received in baptism, I am known as Peter.\\" The assumption of a new name was fairly common amongst Christians. Eusebius the historian took the name Pamphili from Pamphilus, the martyr whom he especially venerated. Earlier still St. Cyprian chose to be called Cyprianus Caecilius out of gratitude to the Caecilius to whom he owed his conversion. St. Dionysius of Alexandria (c. 260) declared, \\"I am of opinion that there were many of the same name as the Apostle John, who on account of their love for him, and because they admired and emulated him, and desired to be loved by the Lord as he was, took to themselves the same name, just as many of the children of the faithful are called Paul or Peter.\\"Eusebius, \\"Hist. Eccl.\\", VII, xxv The assumption of any such new name would take place formally at baptism, in which the catechumen, then probably as now, had to be addressed by some distinctive appellation, and the imposition of a new name at baptism had become general. Every child had necessarily to receive some name or other, and when baptism followed soon after birth this allowed public recognition of the choice made. In the thirtieth of the supposed Arabian Canons of Nicaea: \\"Of giving only names of Christians in baptism\\"; but the sermons of St. John Chrysostom assume in many different places that the conferring of a name, presumably at baptism, ought to be regulated by some idea of Christian edification, and he implies that such had been the practice of earlier generations. For example, he says: \\"When it comes to giving the infant a name, caring not to call it after the saints, as the ancients at first did, people light lamps and give them names and so name the child after the one which continues burning the longest, from thence conjecturing that he will live a long time\\" (Hom. in Cor., xii, 13). Similarly he commends the practice of the parents of Antioch in calling their children after the martyr Meletius (P.G. 50, 515) and urges his hearers not to give their children the first name that occurs, nor to seek to gratify fathers or grandfathers or other family connections by giving their names, but rather to choose the names of holy men conspicuous for virtue and for their courage before God (P.G. 53, 179). There are other historic examples of such a change of name in adult converts. Socrates (Hist. Eccl., VII, xxi) wrote of Athenais who married the Emperor Theodosius the Younger, and who previously to marriage was baptized (AD 421) receiving the name Eudoxia. Bede wrote that King Caedwalla went to Rome and was baptized by the Pope Sergius who gave him the name of Peter. Dying soon afterwards he was buried in Rome and his epitaph beginning Hic depositus est Caedwalla qui est Petrus was pointed out (Bede, \\"Hist. Eccl.\\", V, vii). Later Guthrum the Danish leader in England after his long contest with King Alfred was eventually defeated, and consenting to accept Christianity was baptized in 878, taking the name √Üthelstan. Practice regarding names Various Fathers and spiritual writers and synodal decrees have exhorted Christians to give no names to their children in baptism but those of canonized saints or of the angels of God, but at no point in the history of the Church were these injunctions strictly attended to. They were not observed during the early or the later Middle Ages. In extensive lists of medieval names, such as those found in the indexes of legal proceedings which have been edited in modern times, while ordinary names without religious associations, such as William, Robert, Roger, Geoffrey, Hugh, etc. are common (around the year 1200, William was by far the most common Christian name in England), there are also a number of exceptional names which have apparently no religious associations at all. These include Ademar, Ailma, Ailward, Albreza, Alditha, Almaury, Ascelina, Avice, Aystorius (these come from the lists of those cured at the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury). A rubric in the official \\"Rituale Romanum\\" mandates that the priest ought to see that names of deities or of godless pagans are not given in baptism (curet ne obscoena, fabulosa aut ridicula vel inanium deorum vel impiorum ethnicorum hominum nomina imponantur). A pronouncement from Bourges (1666) addressing parents and godparents urges: \\"Let them give to boys the names of male saints and to girls those of women saints as right order requires, and let them avoid the names of festivals like Easter (P√¢ques), Christmas (No√´l), All Saints (Toussaint) and others that are sometimes chosen.\\" Despite such injunctions \\"Toussaint\\" has become a common French Christian name and \\"No√´l\\" has also found popularity abroad. The addition of Marie, especially in the form Jean- Marie, for girls, and of Joseph for boys is common in present-day France. In Spain and Italy Marian festivals have also created names for girls: Concepci√≥n, of which the diminutive is Concha, as well as Asunci√≥n, Encarnaci√≥n, Mercedes, Dolores etc. in Spanish, and in Italian Assunta, Annunziata, Concetta, etc. The name Mary has not always been a favourite for girls. In England in the 12th century, Mary as a Christian name was rare. The name George, often given in recognition of the Saint George the patron saint of England, was not common in the 13th and 14th centuries, though it grew in popularity after the Protestant Reformation. In the registers of Oxford University from 1560 to 1621, the more common names used by the students in order of popularity were: John, 3826; Thomas, 2777; William, 2546; Richard, 1691; Robert, 1222; Edward, 957; Henry, 908; George, 647; Francis, 447; James, 424; Nicholas, 326; Edmund, 298.see Oxford Hist. Soc. Transactions, XIV In Italy and Spain it has been common practice to call a child after the saint upon whose feast they are born. Confirmation names The practice of adopting a new name was not limited to baptism. Many medieval examples show that any notable change of condition, especially in the spiritual order, was often accompanied by the reception of a new name. In the 8th century, the two Englishmen Winfrith and Willibald going on different occasions to Rome received from the Pope, along with a new commission to preach, the names respectively of Boniface and Clement. Emma of Normandy when she married King Ethelred in 1002 took the name √Ülfgifu; while the reception of a new, monastic name upon entering a religious order remains almost universal. At confirmation, in which the interposition of a godfather emphasizes the resemblance with baptism, it has been customary to take a new name, but usually, use made of it is infrequent. In the case of Henry III, King of France, godson of the English Edward VI had been christened Edouard Alexandre in 1551, the same French prince at confirmation received the name of Henri, and subsequently reigned under this name. In England after the Reformation, the practice of adopting a new name at confirmation was still used, as Sir Edward Coke wrote that a man might validly buy land by his confirmation name, and he recalled the case of a Sir Francis Gawdye, late Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, whose name of baptism was Thomas and his name of confirmation Francis.Co.

Watson is a 1993 Sherlock Holmes pastiche by Nicholas Meyer. Like The Seven Percent Solution and The West End Horror, The Canary Trainer was published as a \\"lost manuscript\\" of the late Dr. John H. Watson. In \\"The Adventure of Black Peter\\", an original Arthur Conan Doyle Holmes story from 1904, Watson mentions that his companion recently arrested \\"Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a plague-spot from the East-End of London.\\" This Wilson (who figures prominently in the Adrian Conan Doyle pastiche \\"The Adventure of the Deptford Horror\\") is not related to the eponymous character of Meyer's novel. Meyer's \\"trainer\\" is Erik, the principal figure of Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera. It is from this unchronicled tale that The Notorious Canary Trainers (a Sherlockian scion in Madison, Wisconsin, founded in 1969) take their name. The Canary Trainer describes Holmes's adventures during the \\"Great Hiatus\\" of 1891-4, when (according to the Sherlockian Canon) he was traveling the world, trying to escape the minions of Professor Moriarty; in Meyer's The Seven-Per- Cent Solution, however, a different impetus is given for this period, and this alternate scenario is maintained here. The bulk of the novel is a first-person narrative, in which Holmes recounts a visit to Paris, where he played violin for the Palais Garnier and became entangled with a mysterious \\"Phantom\\". Although Dr. Watson appears only in the novel's 1912 bookend scenes, a significant sub-plot concerns Holmes' efforts to (temporarily) replace the former with a young Parisian, who, while useful, is not nearly as brave or devoted as Holmes' usual companion. This novel takes place before Meyer's second Holmes pastiche, The West End Horror. Plot summary In 1912, Dr. Watson visits the retired Sherlock Holmes, who is happily cultivating bees on the Sussex Downs. Holmes seems mostly concerned about interesting Watson in his new hobby, but Watson prefers to interrogate Holmes and fill some of the gaps in previous Sherlockian history. For example, Watson says, Holmes's account of how he spent the \\"Lost Years\\" (1891 to 1895) was laden with contradictions. Finally, he persuades Holmes to retell one episode of his adventures. The narration switches to Holmes. He describes how, following the events of The Seven Percent Solution, he traveled Europe and slowly realized that the entire world believed him dead. Wandering aimlessly, he finds himself in Paris, where after a short-lived stint as a violin instructor, he obtains a position at the Paris Op√©ra. From the very beginning, his job has ominous undertones. For example, the vacancy only appeared because the previous violinist ran into the street, swearing that he would never work in the place again. This does not daunt Holmes, who interviews with and favourably impresses the conductor, Ma√Ætre Gaston Leroux. Holmes gradually becomes accustomed to the Opera's distinctive culture. He learns that all minor mishaps are attributed to the Ghost, a spectral personage who haunts the Opera's labyrinthine passageways, sometimes appearing to ballet dancers wearing an evening suit but without a head. L'orchestre de l'op√©ra by Edgar Degas, 1870. Though painted before the events of this novel, the fictional Degas sketch that alerts Irene Adler to Holmes' existence was made in the same building as this work. All goes well until the prima donna soprano, La Sorelli, falls ill and is replaced by Irene Adler, a past adversary known for her ability to outwit Holmes. His admiration for her provokes uncertain emotions, largely foreign to his calculating nature--but he soon realizes that torment is secondary, when the opera rehearsals subject him to her incomparably beautiful singing. He suffers in silence until Adler sees his profile in a Degas painting, whereupon she realizes that he is alive, and enlists his help. She has taken the young coloratura Christine Daa√© \\"under her wing\\", and is fearful that the innocent singer may fall prey to intrigue once Adler has left. Irene Adler blackmails Holmes into assisting her, promising that she will remain silent about his survival. While investigating the intrigues that surround Christine, Holmes appears to run afoul of the Opera Ghost. Characters in \\"The Canary Trainer\\" Note: Bolded characters are based upon characters from The Phantom of the Opera. Italicized characters are based on existing Sherlock Holmes stories. *Sherlock Holmes - the detective, protagonist *Dr. Watson - initial narrator *La Sorelli - the prima donna soprano *Irene Adler - also a singer (previously appeared in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\") *Christine Daa√© - the young coloratura *Ma√Ætre Gaston Leroux - the conductor *The Phantom of the Opera/Nobody: identified in the original novel as Erik, but never named in Meyer's version. Reception Kirkus Reviews found the book lacking calling the finale \\"anticlimactic\\" and summing the review up by saying \\"Should appeal to those fans (and there will be plenty) who can overlook the undistinguished stylistic pastiche--Holmes rather unwisely narrates this lost adventure himself--the footnotes that explain every last Holmesian reference, and the unfortunate poverty of the plot.\\" Matthew Bunson in Encyclopedia Sherlockiana said the plot worked nicely within Leroux's original novel but found the climax \\"unequal to the reputations of both characters\\" and found Watson to be \\"acutely missed.\\" Publishers Weekly said that \\"Meyer's casual plotting (piggybacking on the over-familiar Phantom outline) sinks on occasion into travelogue and affords Holmes little opportunity to flex his deductive muscles\\" but \\"overall, Meyer treats his readers to a lively and entertaining, if undemanding ride.\\" Allusions/references to other works In the prologue, Meyer refers to the \\"Baring-Gould papers\\" as having caused a resumption of interest in Holmes' life, and Meyer includes several allusions to William S. Baring-Gould's works. At the end of the novel, Holmes implies that he and Irene finally consummated their relationship in Montenegro; this seems to be a reference to Baring- Gould's theory that Nero Wolfe was the love child of Holmes and Adler from an affair they had in Montenegro in 1892. Holmes' undercover name, Sigerson, is both a reference to Conan Doyle's story \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\" where Holmes uses that name, and Baring-Gould's Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street, where Holmes' father's name was Siger. Raoul compares Holmes to Auguste Dupin, a comparison which causes Holmes some offense. Watson had also compared Holmes to Dupin in A Study in Scarlet, with similar results. The Marquis de St.-Evremonde, the descendant of Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette from A Tale of Two Cities, is among the guests of the Paris Opera. In the novel's afterword, Meyer acknowledges the two most obvious influences, Conan Doyle's vast Sherlockian opus and Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera, which Meyer terms an \\"absurdist masterpiece\\".

After a brief period of moveabouts after leaving Rwanda, the titular King lived in exile during the final part of his life in the town of Oakton, Virginia, United States. In exile, he was known for heading the King Kigeli V Foundation, an organisation promoting humanitarian work for Rwandan refugees. He was also notable for his activities in maintaining the dynastic, cultural heritage of his formerly reigning royal house, including noble titles, dynastic orders of chivalry and other distinctions. After the king's death, a successor was said to be shortly revealed. In January 2017, it was announced that Yuhi VI of Rwanda would succeed him. Yuhi VI is the nephew of both the late King Kigeli V and the previous King Mutara III, as well as a grandson of King Yuhi V of Rwanda. Early life and education Kigeli was born Ndahindurwa on 29 June 1936 in Kamembe, Rwanda, to Yuhi Musinga, the deposed King Yuhi V of Rwanda, and Queen Mukashema (born Mukashema Bernadette), the seventh of his eleven wives. He was ethnically Tutsi. Kigeli had fourteen siblings, being one of the youngest of his father's many children. When Kigeli was 4 years old, his father was exiled by the Belgian government to Moba, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Following the death of his father, in 1944 he returned to Rwanda. Kigeli was baptised in the Catholic Church in his teens, taking the Christian name Jean- Baptiste, and remained a devout Catholic throughout his life. He received his education at the Groupe Scolaire Astrida (now Groupe Scolaire Officiel de Butare) in Rwanda, and at the Nyangezi College in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. After he finished school in 1956, he worked in local government in Rwanda until 1959. Reign in Rwanda Brass lapel pin Vive Kigeli V \\"Long Live Kigeli V\\" After his half-brother, King Mutara III Rudahigwa, died under mysterious circumstances on 25 July 1959, it was announced on 28 July that Kigeli would succeed him as King Kigeli V Ndahindurwa. \\"Kigeli\\" is sometimes transcribed as \\"Kigeri\\". Though married, Kigeli's late half-brother had had no children; the abrupt, shocking nature of the death prompted widespread talk of some kind of assassination having occurred. Kigeli's appointment was a surprise to the Belgian administration, who were not involved in his selection, and who described the event as a coup d'√©tat, a view shared by the newly politically empowered Hutu elite. Kigeli himself also felt shocked and overwhelmed at the news of his ascension. The tense atmosphere and presence of armed Rwandans at the funeral prevented the Belgians from objecting, as well as preventing Hutu interference. Despite this, Kigeli was initially favoured by all sides: Tutsi traditionalists, Hutu nationalists, and the Catholic clergy all felt optimistic on his appointment. However, the manner of his appointment led to a loss of prestige for the Belgian authorities, and gave both Hutu and Tutsi revolutionaries the impression that violence might further their goals. The fact that the Tutsi establishment had engineered the rise to power also compromised Kigeli's ability to act in the traditional role as a neutral arbiter of differing factions. 110px Kigeli duly followed regal tradition by disregarding past ethnic and ideological affiliations, embracing the role of the 'father of all Rwandan people'. However, political instability and tribal conflict grew despite efforts by the monarchy and others. Only a month after Kigeli's November 1959 ascension, Hutu versus Tutsi militancy increased to the point that hundreds died. Many Tutsi went into exile. Issues with the increasingly restive Hutu population were encouraged by the Belgian military, promoting widespread revolt. Kigeli later wrote, \\"I am not clinging to power... I will always accept the people‚Äôs verdict; what I cannot accept is that the Belgian Administration should influence or distort this verdict.\\" In July 1960, Kigeli sought safe haven in the newly independent nation of Congo. In 1961, Kigeli was in Kinshasa to meet Secretary General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskj√∂ld when Dominique Mbonyumutwa, with the support of the Belgian government, led a coup d'√©tat that took control of the Rwandan state. The monarchy's rule was formally overthrown on 28 January 1961. The coup resulted in the 1961 referendum about the fate of the nation's royal system. The election results showed that, with about 95% turnout, around 80% of voters opposed the continuation of the monarchy. Kigeli criticized the affair as rigged; soon after re-entering Rwanda prior to the election, Belgian officials put him under house arrest. The government officially deported Kigeli to what is now Tanzania on 2 October 1961. He subsequently lived in multiple other locations, leaving the region of Tanganyika (living in Dar es Salaam) for places such as Kampala, Uganda, and Nairobi, Kenya. He was granted political asylum in the United States in July 1992. He resided in the U.S. for the rest of his life. Exile activities Granted political asylum by the United States, he settled near Washington, D.C., where he claimed welfare, and lived in subsidized housing. He subsequently settled in the Oakton, Virginia, area. He traveled internationally to speak on behalf of the Rwandan people and repeatedly called for peace and harmony between the different groups. Kigeli continued to remember the victims of the Rwandan genocide and attempted to reconcile all political, ethnic, and religious parties in Rwanda to use the democratic process to solve any disputes. Kigeli was a friend of former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela and the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Patrice Lumumba. In an August 2007 BBC interview, Kigeli expressed an interest in returning to Rwanda if the Rwandan people were prepared to accept him as their constitutional monarch. He said that he had met President Paul Kagame and that Kagame had told him that he and his family were free to return, but Kigeli said that in order to do so, he needed to know if the people still wanted him to be king. According to Kigeli, Kagame said that he would consult the government about the issue.David Bamford, \\"Rwanda's former king eyes return\\", BBC News, 18 August 2007. =Charity= He was the head of the King Kigeli V Foundation, whose mission is to bring humanitarian initiatives on behalf of Rwandan refugees. Death and succession Kigeli died of a heart ailment at the age of eighty on the morning of 16 October 2016 in a hospital in Washington, D.C.. His private secretary, Guye Pennington, said that an heir had been chosen and would be announced shortly. Kigeli never married, in obedience to a rule banning marriage for kings while they were out of the country. Although Kigeli never married, on 9 January 2017, the Royal House announced that his nephew, Prince Emmanuel Bushayija (to reign as Yuhi VI of Rwanda), would succeed him as pretender to the Rwandan throne. He is the son of the half-brother of Kigeli, Prince William Bushayija. After Kigeli's death, it was revealed he had at least one daughter, Jacqueline Rwivanga, married to Andrew Rugasira 1998-2015 and a mother of five.Heir to Late King of Rwanda Revealed, Holds Ring From Father. Retrieved 25 January 2017.-  Ancestry  Distinctions =Status and recognition= As titular King in exile, as part of maintaining his royal family's cultural heritage, Kigeli V issued chivalric orders and titles of nobility with himself as fount of honour, in accordance with traditional customs. Research in 2016 found that noble Rwandan titles were given to non- Rwandans by King Mutara III, the prior King of Rwanda. This was consistent with King Kigeli's statements that his elder brother, when he reigned as King, granted orders and noble titles to non-Rwandans. An independent article confirming this was printed in an article titled \\"African King Gets Papal Honor from Vatican\\" in The Guardian, a publication of the Roman Catholic diocese of Little Rock, Arkansas, United States, 4 July 1947. The titles are recognised by Burke's Peerage and the Augustan Society. However, the activities have also been a subject of controversy by critics. An article in 2013 presented that donations between $1,000 to $8,000, and services of up to $30,000, have been given prior to the grant of honours. The web site of King Kigeli issued a statement in September 2016 that awards were based on merit, related to past demonstrable charitable work, occupational achievement, and educational background, and that a passage fee could apply. Since the President of the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry could not recognise the titles as part of Rwanda's historical tradition in 2013, he labelled Kigeli's activities in titles \\"very sad\\", calling on them to not be awarded.

Description  The term \\"private press\\" is not synonymous with \\"fine press,\\" \\"small press,\\" or \\"university press\\" ‚Äì though there are similarities. One similarity shared by all is that they need not meet higher commercial thresholds of commercial presses. Private presses, however, often have no profit motive. A similarity shared with fine and small presses, but not university presses, is that for various reasons ‚Äì namely quality ‚Äì production quantity is often limited. University presses are typically more automated. A distinguishing quality of private presses is that they enjoy sole discretion over literary, scientific, artistic, and aesthetic merits. Criteria for other types of presses vary. From an aesthetic perspective, critical acclaim and public appreciation of artisans' works from private presses is somewhat analogous to that of luthiers' works of fine string instruments and bows.  Etymological perspective  The private press movement, and its renowned body of work ‚Äì relative to the larger world of book arts in Western civilization ‚Äì is narrow and recent. From one perspective, collections relating to book arts date back to before the High Middle Ages. As an illustration of scope and influence, a 1980 exhibition at Catholic University of America, \\"The Monastic Imprint,\\" highlighted the influence of book arts and textual scholarship from 1200 to 1980, displaying hundreds of diplomas, manuscript codices, incunabula, printed volumes, and calligraphic and private press ephemera. The displays focused on five areas: (1) Medieval Monasticism, Spirituality, and Scribal Culture, A.D. 1200‚Äì1500; (2) Early Printing and the Monastic Scholarly Tradition, ca. 1450‚Äì1600; (3) Early modern Monastic Printing and Scholarly Publishing, A.D. 1650‚Äì1800; (4) Modern Survivals: Monastic Scriptoria, Private Presses, and Academic Publishing, 1800‚Äì1980. The earliest descriptive references to private presses were by Bernardus A. Mallinckrodt of Mainz, Germany, in (Cologne, 1639). The earliest in-depth writing about private presses was by Adam Heinrich Lackmann (de) (1694‚Äì1754) in (Hamburg, 1740).  Private press movement  United Kingdom The term \\"private press\\" is often used to refer to a movement in book production which flourished around the turn of the 20th century under the influence of the scholar-artisans William Morris, Sir Emery Walker and their followers. The movement is often considered to have begun with the founding of Morris' Kelmscott Press in 1890, following a lecture on printing given by Walker at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in November 1888. Morris decried that the Industrial Revolution had ruined man's joy in work and that mechanization, to the extent that it has replaced handicraft, had brought ugliness with it. Those involved in the private press movement created books by traditional printing and binding methods, with an emphasis on the book as a work of art and manual skill, as well as a medium for the transmission of information. Morris was greatly influenced by medieval printed books and the 'Kelmscott style' had a great, and not always positive, influence on later private presses and commercial book-design. The movement was an offshoot of the Arts and Crafts movement, and represented a rejection of the cheap mechanised book-production methods which developed in the Victorian era. The books were made with high-quality materials (handmade paper, traditional inks and, in some cases, specially designed typefaces), and were often bound by hand. Careful consideration was given to format, page design, type, illustration and binding, in order to produce a unified whole. The movement dwindled during the worldwide depression of the 1930s, as the market for luxury goods evaporated. Since the 1950s, there has been a resurgence of interest, especially among artists, in the experimental use of letterpress printing, paper-making and hand-bookbinding in producing small editions of 'artists' books', and among amateur (and a few professional) enthusiasts for traditional printing methods and for the production 'values' of the private press movement. New Zealand In New Zealand university private presses have been significant in the private press movement. Private presses are active at three New Zealand universities: Auckland (Holloway Press), Victoria (Wai-te-ata Press) and Otago (Otakou Press). North America A 1982 Newsweek article about the rebirth of the hand press movement asserted that Harry Duncan was \\"considered the father of the post-World War II private- press movement.\\" Will Ransom has been credited as the father of American private press historiographers. Selected history Quality control Beyond aesthetics, private presses, historically, have served other needs. John Hunter (1728‚Äì1793), a Scottish surgeon and medical researcher, established a private press in 1786 at his house at 13 Castle Street, Leicester Square, in West End of London, in an attempt to prevent unauthorized publication of cheap and foreign editions of his works. His first book from his private press: A Treatise on the Venereal Disease. One thousand copies of the first edition were printed. Academics Porter Garnett (1871‚Äì1951), of Carnegie Mellon University, was an exponent of the anti-industrial values of the great private presses ‚Äì namely those of Kelmscott, Doves, and Ashendene. Following Garnett's inspirational proposal to Carnegie Mellon, Garnett designed and inaugurated on April 7, 1923, the institute's Laboratory Press ‚Äì for the purpose of teaching printing, which he believed was the first private press devoted solely for that purpose. The press closed in 1935. Selected private presses United States      * Canada Ireland * United Kingdom      France  Asia-Pacific Western Asia *  Opponents of the private press movement  William Addison Dwiggins (1880‚Äì1956), a commercial artist, is lauded for high quality work, namely with Alfred Knopf. And, in contrast to many first-rate book designers joining private presses, he refused. Historian Paul Shaw explained, \\"He had no patience with those who insisted on retaining hand processes in printing and publishing in the belief that they were inherently superior to machine processes.\\" Dwiggins's \\"principle concern ultimately centered on readers and their reading needs, esthetic as well as financial. [His] goal was to make books that were beautiful, functional, and inexpensive.\\"  Gallery  File:Roycroft_printing_press.jpgRoycroft printing press File:Kelmscott_Press_Typefaces.jpgKelmscott Press font styles File:The_Daniel_press._Memorials_of_C._H._O._Daniel,_with_a_bibliography_of_the_press,_1845-1919_(1921)_(14778974891).jpgAlbion press used by the Daniel Press See also * Alternative media * Arts and Crafts movement * Bookbinding * Fine press * Israeli printmaking * Small press * Private Internet connections vs. onion routing * Private Libraries Association * City Lights Bookstore of San Francisco References Further reading * Will Ransom, Private Presses and Their Books.

This impedance is termed the internal resistance of the source. When the power source delivers current, the measured voltage output is lower than the no-load voltage; the difference is the voltage drop (the product of current and resistance) caused by the internal resistance. The concept of internal resistance applies to all kinds of electrical sources and is useful for analyzing many types of electrical circuits. Battery A battery may be modeled as a voltage source in series with a resistance. These types of models are known as equivalent circuit models. Another common model being physiochemical models that are physical in nature involving concentrations and reaction rates. In practice, the internal resistance of a battery is dependent on its size, state of charge, chemical properties, age, temperature, and the discharge current. It has an electronic component due to the resistivity of the component materials and an ionic component due to electrochemical factors such as electrolyte conductivity, ion mobility, speed of electrochemical reaction and electrode surface area. Measurement of the internal resistance of a battery is a guide to its condition, but may not apply at other than the test conditions. Measurement with an alternating current, typically at a frequency of , may underestimate the resistance, as the frequency may be too high to take into account slower electrochemical processes. Internal resistance depends on temperature; for example, a fresh Energizer E91 AA alkaline primary battery drops from about 0.9 Œ© at -40 ¬∞C, when the low temperature reduces ion mobility, to about 0.15 Œ© at room temperature and about 0.1 Œ© at 40 ¬∞C. A large part of this drop is due to the increase in the magnitude of the electrolyte diffusion coefficient. The internal resistance of a battery may be calculated from its open circuit voltage VNL, load voltage VFL, and the load resistance RL: R_{\\\\text{int}} = \\\\left({\\\\frac{ V_{\\\\text{NL}} } { V_{\\\\text{FL}} } - 1 } \\\\right) { R_{\\\\text{L}} } This can also be expressed in terms of the Overpotential Œ∑ and the current I: R_{int}= \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{I} Many equivalent series resistance (ESR) meters, essentially AC milliohm-meters normally used to measure the ESR of capacitors, can be used to estimate battery internal resistance, particularly to check the state of discharge of a battery rather than obtain an accurate DC value.Testing batteries with ESR meter Some chargers for rechargeable batteries indicate the ESR. In use, the voltage across the terminals of a disposable battery driving a load decreases until it drops too low to be useful; this is largely due to an increase in internal resistance rather than a drop in the voltage of the equivalent source. In rechargeable lithium polymer batteries, the internal resistance is largely independent of the state of charge but increases as the battery ages; thus, it is a good indicator of expected life.Understanding RC LiPo BatteriesESR Meter For 2 ‚Äì 6 Cell Lipo Packs - instructions See also *Norton's theorem *Output impedance References * Student Reference Manual for Electronic Instrumentation Laboratories (2nd Edition) - Stanley Wolf & Richard F.M.

The five Sullivan brothers were World War II sailors of Irish American descent who, serving together on the light cruiser , were all killed in action on its sinking around November 14, 1942. The five brothers, the sons of Thomas (1883‚Äì1965) and Alleta Sullivan (1895‚Äì1972) of Waterloo, Iowa, were: *George Thomas Sullivan, 27 (born December 14, 1914), Gunner's Mate Second Class (George had been previously discharged in May 1941 as Gunner's Mate Third Class.) *Francis Henry \\"Frank\\" Sullivan, 26 (born February 18, 1916), Coxswain (Frank had been previously discharged in May 1941 as Seaman First Class.) *Joseph Eugene \\"Joe\\" Sullivan, 24 (born August 28, 1918), Seaman Second Class *Madison Abel \\"Matt\\" Sullivan, 23 (born November 8, 1919), Seaman Second Class *Albert Leo \\"Al\\" Sullivan, 20 (born July 8, 1922), Seaman Second Class History Wartime poster featuring the Sullivan brothers The Sullivans enlisted in the US Navy on January 3, 1942, with the stipulation that they serve together. The Navy had a policy of separating siblings, but this was not strictly enforced. George and Frank had served in the Navy before, but their brothers had not. All five were assigned to the light cruiser . Juneau participated in a number of naval engagements during the months-long Guadalcanal Campaign beginning in August 1942. Early in the morning of November 14, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Juneau was struck by a Japanese torpedo and forced to withdraw. Later that day, as it was leaving the Solomon Islands' area for the Allied rear-area base at Espiritu Santo with other surviving US warships from battle, the Juneau was struck again, this time by a torpedo from the . The torpedo likely hit the thinly armored light cruiser at or near the ammunition magazines and the ship exploded and quickly sank. Captain Gilbert C. Hoover, commanding officer of the light cruiser , and the senior officer present afloat (SOPA) of the battle-damaged US task force, was skeptical that anyone had survived the sinking of Juneau and believed it would be reckless to look for survivors, thereby exposing his wounded ships to a still-lurking Japanese submarine. Therefore, he ordered his ships to continue on towards Espiritu Santo. Helena signaled a nearby US B-17 bomber on patrol to notify Allied headquarters to send aircraft or ships to search for survivors. But in fact, approximately 100 of Juneaus crew had survived the torpedo attack and the sinking of their ship and were left in the water. The B-17 bomber crew, under orders not to break radio silence, did not pass the message about searching for survivors to their headquarters until they had landed several hours later. The crew's report of the location of possible survivors was mixed in with other pending paperwork actions and went unnoticed for several days. It was not until days later that headquarters staff realized that a search had never been mounted and belatedly ordered aircraft to begin searching the area. In the meantime, Juneaus survivors, many of whom were seriously wounded, were exposed to the elements, hunger, thirst, and repeated shark attacks. Eight days after the sinking, ten survivors were found by a PBY Catalina search aircraft and retrieved from the water. The survivors reported that Frank, Joe and Matt died instantly, Al drowned the next day, and George survived for four or five days, before suffering from delirium as a result of hypernatremia (though some sources describe him being \\"driven insane with grief\\" at the loss of his brothers); he went over the side of the raft he occupied. He was never seen or heard from again. Security required that the Navy not reveal the loss of Juneau or the other ships so as not to provide information to the enemy. Letters from the Sullivan sons stopped arriving at the home and the parents grew worried, which prompted Alleta Sullivan to write to the Bureau of Naval Personnel in January 1943, citing rumors that survivors of the task force claimed that all five brothers were killed in action. This letter was answered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 13, 1943, who acknowledged that the Sullivans were missing in action, but by then the parents were already informed of their fate, having learned of their deaths on January 12. That morning, the boys' father, Tom, was preparing for work when three men in uniform ‚Äì a lieutenant commander, a doctor and a chief petty officer ‚Äì approached his door. \\"I have some news for you about your boys,\\" the naval officer said. \\"Which one?\\" asked Tom. \\"I'm sorry,\\" the officer replied. \\"All five.\\" The brothers left a sister, Genevieve (1917‚Äì1975). Al was survived by his wife Katherine Mary and son Jimmy. Joe left a fianc√©e named Margaret Jaros, while Matt left behind a fianc√©e named Beatrice Imperato. The \\"Fighting Sullivan Brothers\\" became national heroes. President Roosevelt sent a letter of condolence to their parents. Pope Pius XII sent a silver religious medal and rosary with his message of regret. The Iowa Senate and House adopted a formal resolution of tribute to the Sullivan brothers. Tom and Alleta Sullivan made speaking appearances at war plants and shipyards on behalf of the war effort.Emily Yellin, Our Mothers' War, pp. 35‚Äì36, .

Founding member David Roback's friend Hope Sandoval became the group's vocalist when Kendra Smith left Opal.Strong, Martin C.; (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p.861‚Äì2 Mazzy Star is best known for the song \\"Fade into You\\" which brought the band some success in the mid-1990s and was the group's biggest mainstream hit, earning extensive exposure on MTV, VH1, and radio airplay. Roback and Sandoval are the creative center of the band, with Sandoval as lyricist and Roback as composer of the majority of the band's material. The band's most recent studio album, Seasons of Your Day, was released in 2013, followed by the EP Still in 2018. History =Opal and Paisley Underground (1981‚Äì1987)= Mazzy Star has deep roots within the Californian Paisley Underground movement of the early 1980s. David Roback, along with his brother Steven, was one of the main architects of leading Los Angeles psychedelic revival band the Rain Parade. Leaving that band after their first LP, he founded Clay Allison in 1983 with then-girlfriend, ex-Dream Syndicate bassist Kendra Smith. Soon after the publication of their sole release, the 1983 double A-sided single \\"Fell From the Sun\\"/\\"All Souls\\", Clay Allison renamed themselves Opal and released the LP Happy Nightmare Baby on SST on December 14, 1987. With Roback as its musical catalyst, Opal were a direct precursor to Mazzy Star musically‚Äîoften featuring the same psychedelic guitar drones and similar hints of blues and folk that would later appear on Mazzy Star recordings. Meanwhile, Sandoval‚Äîwho was in high school at the time‚Äîformed the folk music duo Going Home in the early 1980s with fellow student Sylvia Gomez, and played gigs with Sonic Youth and Minutemen. Both were devoted followers of the Rain Parade, and after a 1983 concert by the band in the Los Angeles area, Gomez entered the backstage area of the venue and gave Roback a copy of Going Home's demo tape, featuring Sandoval on vocals and Gomez on guitar. Upon hearing the tape, Roback offered to produce a still-unreleased album by the pair. When Smith left Opal under cloudy circumstances in the middle of a tour supporting the Jesus & Mary Chain, Sandoval was tapped as her replacement. =Formation and Rough Trade (1988‚Äì1990)= Despite Smith's departure, Rough Trade retained Roback's original record deal, contractually obligating him to supply a follow-up to Opal's debut LP. As a result, Roback and Sandoval continued to tour under the Opal alias for the next two years, during which time they completed production on Opal's planned second album, titled Ghost Highway. Composed mainly of songs written by Roback and Smith, Sandoval stated that she was unhappy with the material, and expressed an interest in wanting to \\"start something completely new\\". The pair quickly composed and recorded seven new tracks in Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco, and renamed the band Mazzy Star. Written over a year before Mazzy Star's inception, the track \\"Ghost Highway\\" is the duo's only original song to not feature a writing credit from Sandoval, while another song, \\"Give You My Lovin, was written by Going Home guitarist Sylvia Gomez and first recorded by Sandoval and Gomez in the mid-1980s. She Hangs Brightly was released in April 1990 on Rough Trade and, although it was not an immediate commercial success, the album established the duo as a recurrent fixture on alternative rock radio, with lead single \\"Blue Flower\\" ‚Äì a cover of the Slapp Happy track ‚Äì peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album would go on to sell over 70,000 copies in the UK. =Capitol (1990‚Äì1997)= The American branch of Rough Trade folded in late 1990, briefly leaving Mazzy Star without a record label. Within weeks, the duo's contract was picked up by Capitol, who re- released She Hangs Brightly on November 4, 1990, and released their follow-up, So Tonight That I Might See on September 27, 1993. A year after its release, the album yielded an unexpected hit single. \\"Fade into You\\" peaked at No. 44 to become their first Billboard Hot 100 single, while also reaching a career- high peak of No. 3 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. On April 19, 1995, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments in excess of 1 million units. The album also peaked at No. 68 in the UK, and was certified silver by the BPI on July 22, 2013 for sales of over 60,000 copies. Following the success of \\"Fade into You\\", She Hangs Brightly album opener \\"Halah\\" began to receive heavy airplay in the US and peaked at No. 19 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, a chart based solely on airplay. In 1995, She Hangs Brightly was awarded a gold certification from the RIAA for shipments in excess of 500,000 units. Their final album for Capitol, Among My Swan, was released on October 29, 1996. Entering the Billboard 200 at No. 68 and, as of September 2001, selling 214,000 copies in the United States, the album was less commercially successful than its predecessors, although it produced their highest-peaking single in the United Kingdom, when \\"Flowers in December\\" entered at No. 40 to become their only top forty entry on the chart. The band promoted the album with a five-month tour of the US and Europe, after which Sandoval and Roback began work on new material. Over the course of these sessions, Sandoval reportedly \\"begged\\" Capitol to be released from her contract, later elaborating, \\"It seemed record companies wanted bands to be creative because they didn't know how to manufacture underground music. We could do our own thing and go at our own pace. But that changed when major labels started wanting bands that would sell 7 million records. They had a formula. And suddenly all these people wanted to come to the studio to keep track of what we were doing and make sure we were following that formula. So we got out.\\" =Hiatus, reunion, and subsequent work (1997‚Äì2009)= In the immediate aftermath of Mazzy Star's dissolution, Sandoval, who had appeared on The Jesus and Mary Chain's 1994 release Stoned & Dethroned, made another guest appearance on their album Munki, and also collaborated with the Chemical Brothers, while Roback produced and mixed two songs found on Beth Orton's 1999 album Central Reservation. In June 2000, the band reunited for a mini-tour of Europe. Performing up to seven new songs at each of these concerts, Sandoval revealed in interviews around this time that these new songs were written and recorded for Mazzy Star's fourth studio album, which was to be released independently sometime in the future. This did not materialize, however, as later that year, Sandoval joined with Colm √ì C√≠os√≥ig (formerly of My Bloody Valentine) to form Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions. In October 2000, Sandoval issued her first EP with The Warm Inventions, At the Doorway Again, and followed it up with her debut full-length album, Bavarian Fruit Bread, a year later. Around this time, Sandoval also contributed vocals to several songs by other artists, notably Air and Death in Vegas. Sandoval performed as part of Bert Jansch's 60th birthday celebration at Queen Elizabeth Hall on November 3, 2003. As well as √ì C√≠os√≥ig, Jansch and his son Adam, she was also joined on stage by David Roback for renditions of \\"Suzanne\\" and \\"All This Remains\\", a song Sandoval had contributed lead vocals and wrote lyrics to for Jansch's 2002 album Edge of a Dream. This would remain Sandoval and Roback's final appearance together on-stage until 2012. David Roback made his debut appearance as an actor in the 2004 film Clean. He also wrote and produced three songs that were performed in the film by actress Maggie Cheung. In 2009, So Tonight That I Might See album track \\"Into Dust\\" debuted at No. 71 and stayed one week on the U.K. singles chart when it featured on a commercial for Virgin Media. Two years later, the song appeared on the \\"Dust to Dust\\" trailer for Gears of War 3 and spent a further four weeks on the chart, reaching a new peak of No. 47; while it also became the band's first song to ever place on the Irish Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 40. Sandoval's second album with The Warm Inventions, Through the Devil Softly, was released via Nettwerk on September 29, 2009 and was followed on August 10, 2010 by a non-album single, a cover of Syd Barrett's \\"Golden Hair\\". Also released in 2010 was her vocal contribution to Massive Attack's Heligoland, \\"Paradise Circus\\". The song spent one week on the U.K. singles chart at No. 117. =Reformation and Seasons of Your Day (2010‚Äì2014)= The first substantive confirmation that the duo would reconvene to complete work on their fourth studio album came from Sandoval herself in a July 2009 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, where she was quoted as saying, \\"It's true we're still together. We're almost finished [with the record]. But I have no idea what that means.\\" Later, in a September 2009 interview with Vancouver-based music website Straight.com, interviewer John Lucas wrote of the 8-year gap between Bavarian Fruit Bread and Through the Devil Softly, \\"That seems like a long time until you consider that Mazzy Star, Sandoval's partnership with guitarist David Roback, hasn't put an album out since 1996. Sandoval promises that will change; she and Roback have their very own Chinese Democracy in the works, but it won't see the light of day until The Warm Inventions have wrapped up their tour.\\" On October 12, 2011, Hope Sandoval's official website confirmed the duo would release their first new material in 15 years later that same month. The double a-sided single \\"Common Burn\\"/\\"Lay Myself Down\\" was released digitally on October 31, 2011. A limited edition blue-coloured 7\\" vinyl was also announced for release on November 8, though a manufacturing delay resulted in its release being pushed back to January 24, 2012. Their fourth studio album was expected to be released in the latter half of 2012, following completion of a tour earlier in the year. The band completed an 18-date Californian and European tour in 2012, their first since 2000. Performing at several major European festivals, the band consisted of original members Suki Ewers and Keith Mitchell, and were also joined by Sandoval's Warm Inventions band-mate Colm √ì C√≠os√≥ig and Keith Mitchell's son Paul, whose band the Brook Lee Catastrophe also served as the opening act of select shows. Pedal steel guitar was performed by Josh Yenne. After the final date of the tour in August 2012, David Roback stated that production on the album had completed and that it would see release \\"soon\\". In late 2012, several unreleased song titles composed by Hope Sandoval and David Roback were registered with the band's long-time publisher BMI, including \\"Flying Low\\" and \\"Spoon\\", both of which were performed multiple times on the tour. The band also launched an official merchandise store. On July 13, 2013, the band announced details of their fourth studio album, Seasons of Your Day, which was released on September 23, 2013 in the UK, followed a day later on September 24 in the US. The album reached a career-high No. 24 on the UK albums chart. The band began a North American tour on November 3, 2013 in support of the album. On April 19, the band released two new songs as part of Record Store Day 2014. \\"I'm Less Here\\" and \\"Things\\" were released on 7\\" vinyl, with the run limited to 3,000 copies worldwide. On December 22, 2014, a 40-second clip of a previously unreleased song was posted on the band's official Facebook account. =Renewed solo activity (2016‚Äì2017)= On March 9, 2016, it was confirmed that Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions would release a 7\\" vinyl single titled \\"Isn't It True\\" for Record Store Day 2016. The track also features Jim Putnam of Radar Bros. A music video for the song was released on April 19, and is dedicated to Richie Lee of Acetone. The Warm Inventions' third studio album, Until the Hunter, was released on November 4 through the band's own independent record label, Tendril Tales. A second single from the album, \\"Let Me Get There\\" featuring Kurt Vile, was released on September 23. A new four-song EP from The Warm Inventions, Son of a Lady, was released on September 15, 2017. Sandoval contributed vocals to \\"I Don't Mind\\" by Psychic Ills, which was released on March 29, 2016. Four months later, Massive Attack released \\"The Spoils\\", which was her third collaboration with the band, following \\"Paradise Circus\\" and \\"Four Walls\\". A music video starring actress Cate Blanchett was released on August 9. Keith Mitchell, who played drums on all four Mazzy Star albums, died on May 14, 2017. =Live performances and EP (2018‚Äìpresent)= In June 2018, the band reunited for their first concerts in five years, performing on three consecutive nights at the Sydney Opera House as part of Vivid Live. That same month, they released the EP Still. David Roback died on February 24, 2020, of metastatic cancer. Members =Hope Sandoval= Hope Sandoval was born in 1966 and grew up in a Catholic Mexican-American family in East Los Angeles, California. She attended Mark Keppel High School. In 1986, she formed the folk music duo Going Home with Sylvia Gomez, and recorded one album produced by David Roback, which is yet to be released. Besides vocals, Sandoval plays acoustic guitar, harmonica, Hammond organ, percussion, glockenspiel and xylophone. During live performances, Sandoval prefers to sing in near-darkness with only a dim backlight, playing the tambourine, harmonica, glockenspiel or shaker. She is reputed to have a shy personality, and rarely interacts with the audience, once stating \\"I just get really nervous. Once you're onstage, you're expected to perform. I don't do that. I always feel awkward about just standing there and not speaking to the audience, but it's difficult for me.\\" Sandoval currently resides in both San Francisco and Ireland. =David Roback= In Mazzy Star, Roback played guitar, keyboard, and piano. He wrote almost all music for Mazzy Star, and produced all their recordings. Roback grew up in Pacific Palisades, California, graduating from Palisades High School in 1975. He started a band called Rain Parade with his brother Steven. They first hit the scene in 1982 as part of a loose aggregate of psychedelic 1960s-influenced guitar bands in Los Angeles, and they were in the forefront of that movement which lasted a couple of years. After Rain Parade's first album and tours, Roback left the band. He then became involved with ex-Dream Syndicate bassist Kendra Smith and formed a new band called Clay Allison in 1983. The recordings from the summer this year remained unreleased until the 1989 release of Opal Early Recordings. After Clay Allison's 1984 tour, the band decided to go with a name change, and went from Clay Allison to Opal, whose sound was defined by Roback's spare, distorted guitar work and Smith's vocals. They released the Northern Line EP in 1985. SST Records signed Opal and released their album Happy Nightmare Baby on December 14, 1987. During the Opal tour in December 1987, Smith left the band. She was replaced by Sandoval, and they toured Europe through early 1988. Roback and Sandoval had an intimate relationship at this time and after Opal was disbanded, they took the remaining members of Opal and changed their name to Mazzy Star. Roback spent most of the past decade living in Norway before his death on February 24, 2020. =Additional musicians= The other contributors to Mazzy Star include: ;Current lineup * Suki Ewers ‚Äì keyboards * Colm √ì C√≠os√≥ig ‚Äì guitar, bass, keyboards, drums * Josh Yenne ‚Äì pedal steel guitar and acoustic/electric guitars. ;Former members * Kurt Elzner ‚Äì touring guitarist * Jill Emery ‚Äì bass * William Cooper, real name Will Glenn (1957‚Äì2001) ‚Äì keyboards, violin * Keith Mitchell ‚Äì drums (d.

In 2011, it had a population of 4,780. Alderley Edge is northwest of Macclesfield and south of Manchester, at the base of a steep and thickly wooded sandstone escarpment, Alderley Edge, which is the area's chief topographical feature and overlooks the Cheshire Plain. Alderley Edge is known for its affluence and expensive houses, falling inside Cheshire's Golden Triangle. Alderley Edge has a selection of cafes and designer shops and has attracted numerous Premier League footballers, actors and multi-millionaire businesspeople. It is one of the most expensive and sought-after places to live in the UK outside central London. History Alderley Edge in 1951 Alderley Edge Prize Band Druid's Circle on The Edge, a folly stone circle probably placed here in the 19th century The Wizard Pub London Road Alderley Edge railway station A cottage in the village The entrance to the local cemetery The Merlin Restaurant The area around Alderley Edge provides proof of occupation since the Mesolithic period with flint implements being found along the line of the sandstone outcrop. Evidence of copper mining in the Bronze Age has also been found to the south of the area. In 1995 members of the Derbyshire Caving Club found a hoard of 564 coins of the Roman Empire (now in the Manchester Museum) dating from AD 317 to AD 336. There are to date 13 recorded sites on the County Sites and Monuments Record (CSMR) in the settled area of Alderley Edge and 28 in Nether Alderley, with a further 44 along the Edge. Early medieval settlements are recorded at Nether Alderley, to the south of Alderley Edge. The first written evidence of Alderley Edge, known then as 'Chorlegh' (later spelt as 'Chorley') appeared in the 13th century, the likely derivation being from ceorlUniversity of Michigan Electronic Middle English Dictionary Retrieval date: 17 October 2007 and lƒìah,University of Michigan Electronic Middle English Dictionary Retrieval date: 17 October 2007. meaning a peasants' clearing. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, it is included in a charter of c.1280. The name 'Alderley' first appears in 1086 as 'Aldredelie'. Several versions of the origin are known: one says it originated from Aldred and leah meaning 'Aldred's Clearing'. Another says it is most likely that the name Alderley came from Old English language 'Al√∞r»≥√∞elƒìah' meaning \\"the meadow or woodland clearing of a woman called Al√∞r»≥√∞. In the 13th century and during the Middle Ages, the area comprised estates that had many owners. Since the 15th century, most of them have belonged to the De Trafford baronets. The principal manors were based on the 14th century Chorley Old Hall, which is south-west of Alderley Edge, and the Old Hall, at Nether Alderley, a 16th-century building burnt down in 1779. The economies of Chorley and Nether Alderley were dominated by agriculture with a market charter granted at Nether Alderley in c.1253. Nether Alderley Mill dates back to 1391, although the present timber structure is 16th century. The millpond was adapted to form the moat, which surrounded the Old Hall, the home of the Stanley family. The corn mill continued to be worked until 1939 when Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley, was compelled to sell it, along with the rest of the Alderley Park estate, to meet the cost of death duties. In the 1950s the National Trust bought the site and has since restored the building and opened it to the public. Cheshire had its own system of taxes in the mediaeval period, the Mize, and in the records for 1405 Chorley was assessed at 20s 0d and Nether Alderley at 27s 0d. Lead and copper mining on the Edge is documented in the late 17th century and 18th century. After the destruction of the Old Hall in the late 18th century, the Stanley family moved to Park House on the south edge of Alderley Park, and house and park were afterwards much extended. Throughout the 19th century Nether Alderley remained under the control of the Stanleys and the lack of development pressure meant that the dispersed medieval settlement pattern was retained. In 1830 Chorley consisted of only a few cottages, the De Trafford Arms Inn, a toll bar, and a smithy, straggling along the Congleton to Manchester Road. The coming of the railway in 1842 with the construction of the Stockport to Crewe section of the main Manchester and Birmingham Railway changed all this. The Manchester and Birmingham Railway Company built the line through Chorley, offering free season tickets for 20 years to Manchester businessmen who built houses with a rateable value of more than ¬£50 within a mile of the station. This 'season ticket' was in the form of a small silver oval which could be worn on a watch chain. The railway also gave Alderley Edge its current name. As the railway network expanded and travel became easier, the railway company did not want its station called Chorley because of the possible confusion with Chorley in Lancashire. So, in 1880 they renamed it Alderley Edge railway station, against much opposition, taking the old name for the village and the name of the sandstone escarpment already known as The Edge. The name Chorley, Macclesfield is retained by the civil parish to the northwest of Alderley Edge. Following the construction of the railway, the local landowner, Sir Humphrey de Trafford, of Chorley Hall, laid out an extensive estate of new roads and new houses were incrementally added, filling in most of the available sites by 1910. Of these, nine are now listed grade II. The area boundary largely reflects de Trafford's original estate boundaries. Also because of the railway, Alderley became a popular place to visit and the railway company popularised day trips and cheap excursions to the village. This period also saw the appearance of buildings which are now landmarks. St Philip's Church, Alderley Edge, with its spire, was built in 1853 and the village primary school a year later known as Alderley Edge Community Primary School.http://www.hostedonharper.co.uk/cheshire/alderleyedge/ Two all-girls schools were opened, St Hilary's in 1876 and Mount Carmel in 1945, which then merged in 1999 to form Alderley Edge School for Girls. A boys' school, The Ryleys School, was opened in 1877. The Mission Hall (later known as The Institute) was built as a temperance hall for the recreation of the 'lower classes' by the wealthier residents in 1878. The Methodist Church in Chapel Road was built ten years after St Philip's. The area is notable for its heavily wooded streets and substantial Victorian villas set in spacious gardens. The first villa was constructed in the early 1840s and by 1850 thirty \\"handsome residences\\" had been erected, some of them in what is now the Alderley Edge Conservation Area. Cotton barons from Manchester built their mansions here and now (as at around 2010) they are changing hands for several million pounds. The village winds up a high street with many restaurants, designer shops and speciality food shops. Around the village, winding lanes are covered in their original sandstone setts and front boundary walls are usually built from the same local sandstone. The buildings are varied in style with examples of mock Tudor, Italian, neo-Georgian and Arts and Crafts Movement designs. The wide range of materials used reflects this somewhat eclectic mix of styles, and includes stone, brick (several colours), smooth render or roughcast for the walls, and Welsh slate or clay tiles for the roofs. The growth of Alderley Edge is recorded in the census returns, with the population rising from 561 in 1841 to 2856 in 1902 (the return for Nether Alderley shows a drop from 679 to 522 within the same period). There was no church in Chorley until 1852, when the larger expansion of the town in the demanded enlarged accommodation, but St Mary's Church, Nether Alderley, retains some 14th century work including a font. The First Edition Ordnance Survey map of 1871 therefore shows \\"Chorley\\" (as it still was) with the new Queen's Hotel next to the station, new shops and terraced houses along London Road, and a Post Office at the town centre, where Macclesfield Road meets Alderley Road. To the north are wooded areas with detached villas, but to the east is a much larger area, roughly approximating to the modern conservation area, where curving roads divide generous wooded plots, usually with its own house, although some plots remained undeveloped until much later. Of interest is the use of the names \\"Brickfield\\" and \\"Brick kiln\\" on a site to the north- east of Alderley Edge, suggesting a source for the local bricks. The 1899 map shows a similar footprint but it is much easier to make out the individual villas and their names ‚Äì Holybank, Ashfield (Alderley Edge villa), The Larches, etc. Also very evident on this map are the remains of the old mines towards and within Windmill Wood, immediately to the southeast. In the 20th century, Alderley Edge continued to expand with much post-war housing around the northeastern and western edges. Nether Alderley has remained relatively unchanged, apart from the sale of Alderley Park to Astra Zeneca (previously ICI, Imperial Chemical Industries). Astra Zeneca has since sold Alderley Park to Manchester-based, family-owned property company Bruntwood. The park is now home to 150 science companies and is the UK's largest single-site life-science facility along with commercial workspace, residential and retail spaces. Administrative history From medieval times the area was part of the Chorley township of the ancient parish of Wilmslow in the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. Under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 Chorley became a civil parish in its own right. Alderley Edge civil parish was created on 31 December 1894 from part of Chorley civil parish. Along with Bollinfee civil parish it formed Alderley Edge Urban District. In 1974 it became a civil parish in the new non-metropolitan district of Macclesfield. Since 1 April 2009 it has been part of the unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 =Boundary changes= The civil parish was enlarged on 30 September by gaining a further part of Chorley. On 1 October 1910 it was enlarged by gaining part of Nether Alderley civil parish. It was further enlarged on 1 April 1936 by the transfer of a further from Chorley and from Wilmslow civil parish and by gaining on the abolition of Bollinfee civil parish.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10106394 Economy At the 2001 UK census, the Alderley Edge ward had a possible workforce of approximately 2157 people. The economic activity of residents in the Alderley Edge electoral ward was 36.9% in full-time employment, 10.2% in part-time employment, 29.3% self-employed, 1.7% unemployed, 1.4% students with jobs, 3.5% students without jobs, 19.3% retired, 7.5% looking after home or family, 2.8% permanently sick or disabled and 2.0% economically inactive for other reasons. Alderley Edge has a very high rate of self-employment (29.3%) compared with rest of the Macclesfield borough (22.7%) and England (16.6%). Alderley Edge also has low rates of unemployment (1.7%) compared with the rest of the Macclesfield borough (2.0%) and England (3.3%). The Office for National Statistics estimated that during the period of April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in Alderley Edge was ¬£720 (¬£37,440 per year). Notable residents After the death of their father in 1870, George Gissing and his two younger brothers were sent to Lindow Grove, a quaker boarding school in Alderley Edge, whose headmaster James Wood was often parodied by the novelist.Pierre Coustillas, \\"Gissing, George Robert (1857‚Äì1903)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2004. The Pilkington family (of Pilkington's Glass) owned all of the woodland now known as The Edge until 1948, when their daughters donated the land to the National Trust. The Pilkington company developed the toughened safety glass necessary when motor cars and very tall buildings became popular. They became hugely wealthy. On Woodbrook Road they built The Cedars as the family home, which has a distinctive large tower and is built from white stone. (The house is now sub-divided into four luxury dwellings.) The author Alan Garner, who wrote the children's fantasy novel The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, which is set on Alderley Edge, lived on Trafford Road, Alderley Edge. Footballers who live in Alderley Edge include Joleon Lescott and Manchester United players Dwight Yorke, Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick. David Beckham and his wife Victoria Beckham previously resided in Alderley Edge. A number of Coronation Street actors, including Helen Flanagan, Denise Welch and Richard Fleeshman, also live in the village. Landmarks =The Edge= To The Edge sign, Alderley Edge Aerial photograph of Alderley Edge showing The Edge escarpment overlooking the village Woodland path at Alderley Edge The Edge is a wide red sandstone escarpment situated above the village of Alderley. An edge is used as a descriptive term for high land in Cheshire and adjacent counties, such as in Wenlock Edge and Blackstone Edge. The Edge at Alderley is a ridge of land separating a narrow and short valley from the higher ground of southeast Cheshire and Derbyshire. It rises gradually from the town of Macclesfield, until, at a distance of 7 or 8 kilometres, it terminates abruptly, having reached a height of nearly 215 metres above sea level, and 110 metres above the Cheshire Plain below it. It was formed partly by the weathering of resistant sandstone lying on top of a softer sandstone, and partly by faulting of the rocks. The scarp or slope is repeated eight times by faults of up to 200 metres, which has thrown down blocks of sandstone west to Alderley and east to the village of Kirkleyditch. The northern side of the Edge is shaped like a horse shoe or hough (pronounced huff), as this type of ridge is called in Cheshire. The Edge also marks the line of a hamlet of scattered houses called The Hough, which descend towards Alderley village. The Edge is owned by the National Trust. It is maintained as a public access wooded area and is a popular destination for day trippers from Manchester and the nearby towns of Wilmslow and Macclesfield. There is a car park with toilet facilities. The Edge has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its unique geology. Its woodland area is riddled with the old Alderley Edge Mines. Views thumb From its highest point, the Edge affords panoramic views across Cheshire and the Peak District and walking paths through the property, as well as one to nearby National Trust property Hare Hill. From the Edge, the Cheshire Plain, can be seen extending from the area of Macclesfield Forest on the south east side with its undulating land and woods, towards the extreme easterly point of the Derbyshire peaks, and northerly to Manchester and Blackstone Edge in Yorkshire. Until trees were planted at the Edge (1745‚Äì1755), visitors to the Edge could see a full 360¬∞ panorama of the country around; today the view from the Edge itself is limited to the northerly and easterly directions. Trees now obscure the views in other directions, including views of the Wrekin in Shropshire to the south; The Cloud near Bosley and Mow Cop (where the Cheshire Plain meets the Peckforton Hills, Beeston Castle, and the Delamere Forest) to the southwest; and west to the mountains of North Wales. History The Edge was described as a dreary common till the year 1779, when it was enclosed together with all the other waste lands of Alderley. Some hundreds of Scots pines were planted on the highest points by Sir James and Sir Edward Stanley, between 1745 and 1755; before that time, it does not appear that a single tree grew on it. In 1882, George Ormerod in his book The History of Cheshire described the Edge as \\"an abrupt and elevated ridge, formerly the site of a Beacon, which bears the appearance of having been detached by some great convulsion of nature from the range of the Macclesfield hills, as Helsby and Beeston seem to have been from those of Delamere and Peckforton. Near the summit, \\"cobalt ore, lead, and copper have been got in small quantities. The sides are varied with cultivated land, wood, and rock; and the entire mass presents a striking object to all the surrounding district, over which it commands a most extensive prospect.\\" =Alderley Edge mines= right The escarpment in Alderley Edge has long been a site of copper mining. Archaeological evidence indicates that mining took place here during Roman times and the Bronze Age, and written records show that mining continued here from the 1690s up to the 1920s. Many of the mines are owned by the National Trust and have been leased from them by the Derbyshire Caving Club which maintains access and continues to explore and search for areas of mining that have been closed for centuries. From the 1860s onwards, there have been many thousands of visitors to the mines. However, many other visitors, especially between 1940 and 1960, were ill-equipped and unprepared. This led to a series of accidents that gained the mines a notoriety which still haunts them today. The West and Wood Mines were finally blocked in the early 1960s (Jones, 1961). In 1969, the Derbyshire Caving Club obtained permission from the National Trust (the owners) to re-open Wood Mine and since then much has been found by excavation and exploration and thousands of people have visited the mines in supervised groups. Chorley Old Hall =Historic buildings= There are many historic buildings including Chorley Old Hall, which is the oldest surviving manor house in Cheshire. To the south of the village is the Alderley Park estate, former ancestral home of the Stanleys. Local legends There are several local legends, the most famous being that of the Wizard of the Edge. =The Wizard of the Edge= Legend has it that a farmer from Mobberley was taking a milk white mare to sell at the market in Macclesfield. Walking along the Edge, he reached a spot known locally as \\"Thieves Hole\\" where an old man clad in a grey and flowing garment stopped him. The old man offered the farmer a sum of money for his horse but the farmer refused, saying he could get a better price at the market. The old man told the farmer that he would be at this spot again that evening when the farmer returned, not having found a purchaser for the horse. The farmer failed to sell the horse making his journey back along the Edge. At the same point, the old man appeared again, repeating his offer, which this time was accepted. The old man told the farmer to follow him with the horse. As they approached an area just past Stormy Point, the old man held out a wand and uttered a spell, opening the rock revealing a pair of huge iron gates, which the wizard ‚Äì as he was ‚Äì opened. Assuring no harm the wizard told the farmer to enter. The farmer did so, and was led through the gates into a large cavern. In the cavern, the farmer saw countless men and white horses, all asleep. In a recess there was a chest, from which the wizard took the payment for the horse, which he gave to the farmer. The astonished farmer asked what all this meant; the wizard explained that all these sleeping warriors were ready to awake and fight should England fall into danger. He then ordered the farmer to leave and return home. There are several versions of the legend. It first appeared in print when a letter, sent by someone using the pseudonym \\"A Perambulator\\", was published in the Manchester Mail in 1805. \\"A Perambulator\\" wrote in his letter that the story had been related to him by an old servant of the Stanley family of Alderley, and it used to be told by Parson Shrigley, former Clerk and Curate of Alderley (who was in the post from 1753 until his death in 1776 and is buried in Alderley Church). It subsequently appeared in expanded form in a tourist pamphlet, in both prose and verse forms, the former under the title The Cheshire Enchanter and the latter The Legend of the Iron Gates. Several versions include parts of prophecies made by Robert Nixon in the wizard's explanation to the farmer, such as \\"There will come a day when these men and these horses, awakening from their enchanted slumber, will descend into the plain, decide the fate of a great battle, and save their country. This shall be when George the son of George shall reign.\\" Some later variations, such as a poem by James Roscoe, say that the Wizard was Merlin and the sleeping men were King Arthur and his army. =Similar legends= There are a number of similar British legends which closely resemble the Alderley one, though since they are all founded in oral tradition it is not possible to know which came first. In one, set in the Eildon Hills in Scotland and narrated by Sir Walter Scott, the old man is named as Thomas of Erceldoune and the horses are black. Once in the cave, the old man asks the farmer to choose between a sword and a horn. The farmer chooses the horn, and immediately the horses all jump up and start to stamp their hooves on the ground. The terrified farmer is expelled from the cave by a whirlwind and hears the words \\"Woe is the coward that ever was born, that did not draw the sword but blew the horn\\". Another very similar one was made into a ballad called Sir Guy the Seeker by Matthew 'Monk' Lewis, and is based on a legend of Dunstanburgh Castle. In his preface to Sir Guy the Seeker Lewis pointed out the similarity to the Alderley legend. Alan Garner used the legend of The Wizard of the Edge, and other local legends, in his novels The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath. Garner, born in Congleton, was raised in Alderley Edge. Gold and coins Several ancient gold bars have been found at Alderley Edge, the first on Artists Lane. It was declared treasure trove, and an inquest was held in Congleton on 26 February 1993. John Cherry from the British Museum along with Adrian Tindall, the Principal Conservation Officer (Archaeology) for Cheshire County Council, reported that the gold bar weighed 97.01 grams and was determined to be 73% gold. The publicity caused the public to search for more, and indeed five more gold bars were found. Members of the Derbyshire Caving Club found a Roman coin hoard in 1995; the hoard contained 564 coins from AD 317‚Äì36. Transport =Bypass= New bridge over bypass, Brook Lane, September 2010 After several decades of discussion, a 5 km, north-to-south A34 Alderley Edge bypass was constructed (officially named Melrose Way) to the west of Alderley Edge to reduce traffic flow through the centre of village. It starts at the Harden roundabout at the south end of the existing Wilmslow bypass and goes west of Alderley Edge and rejoins the A34 at the bend about 400 yards north of the south gate of Astra Zeneca's laboratory grounds. The bypass was constructed to relieve the congestion caused by the 26,000 vehicles that previously passed through Alderley Edge daily. The project cost ¬£56 million and the main civil engineering works were contracted to Birse Civils. The bypass was officially opened by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP for Alderley Edge, George Osborne, on Friday, 19 November 2010, \\"over 6 months before schedule\\" according to a notice that contractors put up at its south end. =Railway= Alderley Edge railway station is situated on the Crewe to Manchester line and each hour has two trains to Crewe, two to Manchester Piccadilly via Stockport and one to Manchester Piccadilly via Manchester Airport. In popular culture The village has been used as a major setting in various books and television shows: *The village was the main setting of the Channel 4 show Goldplated *The village was the main setting of the MTV show Living on the Edge *The Edge and the country south of it was the setting for Alan Garner's novels The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath. *The village has been featured in the ITVBe show The Real Housewives of Cheshire.

The name \\"Calcasieu\\" comes (via French) from the Indian Atakapa language katkosh, for \\"eagle\\", and yok, \\"to cry\\". The Calcasieu River Bridge crosses the Calcasieu River in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The Calcasieu rises in Vernon Parish, north of Leesville, and flows initially southeast, passing through the Kisatchie National Forest southwest of Alexandria. It then turns southwest, flowing past Oakdale and Lake Charles, the largest city on the river. It enters the north end of the brackish Calcasieu Lake, an estuary on the Gulf of Mexico approximately southwest of Lake Charles. The lake, which is referred to by locals as \\"Big Lake\\", is connected by a channel to the gulf on the south end. The lower portion of the river south of Lake Charles is paralleled by a navigable canal which connects to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. In the early 19th century, the area of present-day Louisiana and Texas west of the Calcasieu River extending roughly north-south to the Arroyo Hondo in Natchitoches Parish and east of the Neches River was disputed between the United States and Spain. The dispute arose from differing interpretations of the western boundary of Louisiana under the terms of the Louisiana Purchase. The area became known as Neutral Ground and became a haven for privateers outside the legal jurisdiction of both nations. Because the river passes through areas intensive in petroleum refining and other industries, petrochemical wastes have been found contaminating the river and estuarine environment along the lower Calcasieu River. A 1993 Condea Vista Chemical Company pipeline spill was reported by the company to have leaked 1.6 million pounds of a highly toxic chemical known as ethylene dichloride. Mother Jones reported the spill as potentially discharging between 19 and 47 million pounds that would have spread throughout parts of the estuary.

The site was designated a \\"super-fund site\\" and Sasol has been involved in long term legal battles that have resulted in settlements, fines, and clean up of affected areas. A problem is that the chemical sinks in water and gets covered by deposits of silt. Cleanup would inherently disturb the covered chemical stirring it up causing further ecological damage.

It has been published since 1919, originally by Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, and currently by West (a business unit of Thomson Reuters) and remains an important tool for legal research. Each ALR volume contains several annotations. An annotation is an article that summarizes the evolution of a very specific legal concept in a concise and precise fashion. The article will either be preceded by the full text of an important relevant case, or in later series, contain a reference to the text of the case, which is reproduced at the end of the volume. The article will contain a wide variety of relevant citations to cases from throughout the United States and secondary sources like law review articles. The range and number of citations is always strongly representative but not always guaranteed to be completely comprehensive. Although similar in tone to the articles in legal encyclopedias, ALR annotations are different in that they are not organized alphabetically, and they tend to delve more deeply into a specific legal principle or doctrine, while, in contrast, encyclopedia articles aim for a broader view of the legal issue. In addition, ALR articles are careful to provide cases on both sides of the legal issue and provide listings of cases according to their jurisdiction. Since the annotations are published in the order the leading cases were decided, there are various finding aids. The combined ALR Index indexes topics covered from ALR2d to the current series of ALR and all series of ALR Fed. West's ALR Digest now follows the classification system of the West American Digest System, and includes headnotes for the reported cases, as well as references to the annotations. For topics covered entirely by federal law, the softbound Quick Index indexes annotations in ALR Fed. The softbound Table of Cases (for a state case) or ALR Federal Table of Cases (for a federal case) provides ALR references for a particular case. A reader may also use the references in American Jurisprudence, Corpus Juris Secundum, and state encyclopedias published by Thomson West to find a more in-depth discussion in ALR. Finally, ALR articles may also be searched on Westlaw. ALR has been published in several series (the current series is ALR7th) and there are series of ALR Fed (which focuses on federal law). ALR3d through ALR6th and ALR Fed are updated by pocket part supplements (the first series has a citation service, and ALR2d a Later Case Service). Annotations may be superseded by a later annotation in which the editor reanalyzes the law in light of recent developments.

Not shown are the many Native American villages. The Illinois-Wabash Company, formally known as the United Illinois and Wabash Land Company, was a company formed in 1779 from the merger of the Illinois Company and the Wabash Company. The two companies had been established in order to purchase land from Native Americans in the Illinois Country, a region of North America acquired by Great Britain in 1763. The Illinois Company purchased two large tracts of land in 1773; the Wabash Company purchased two additional tracts in 1775. Because the Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade private purchase of Native American lands, Great Britain refused to recognize these transactions. Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, officials of the merged Illinois-Wabash Company appealed to both Virginia (which claimed the Illinois Country) and to the United States to recognize their land purchases, but were unsuccessful. After the United States bought the land in question from Native Americans and resold it, the matter eventually went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823), the Court ruled that the U.S. government, following earlier British precedent, would not recognize private purchases of native lands, and that Illinois-Wabash Company's purchases were therefore invalid. Land purchases and British denial of title In the middle of the 18th century, merchants and land speculators in the British Empire were looking to expand beyond the Appalachian Mountains into the interior of North America. Companies such as the Ohio Company of Virginia had been formed for this purpose, but rivalry between the British and the French for access to the region led to the outbreak of the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763), interrupting the activities of the companies. After the British victory in the war, the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which sought to organize and stabilize the vast new territory won from France. In order to prevent the conditions which had produced the war and its sequel, Pontiac's Rebellion (1763‚Äì1766), the British government forbade private individuals or companies from purchasing land from American Indians. Thereafter, only royal officials would be permitted to conduct treaties in order to buy Native American lands. In 1768, a group of prominent merchants from Philadelphia began doing business in the Illinois Country, selling provisions to American Indians and British troops. In 1773, William Murray, the merchants' agent in Illinois, learned of a British legal opinion known as the Camden-Yorke Opinion. This opinion made quite an impact in North America because it was interpreted by some to suggest that private purchases of land from American Indians would now be recognized by the British Crown. With this in mind, Murray and his Philadelphia employers organized the Illinois Company and, on 5 July 1773, purchased two tracts of land from the Kaskaskia, Peoria, and Cahokia tribes. British officials, however, refused to recognize the legality of the Illinois Company's purchase‚Äìthe interpretation of Camden-Yorke circulating in America had been misleading. In April 1774, Murray turned to his kinsman, Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia. Dunmore agreed to lend support to the company's purchases in exchange for a piece of the action. Murray then formed the Wabash Company with Lord Dunmore as a member. On October 18, 1775, an agent for the Wabash Company purchased two tracts of land along the Wabash River from the Piankeshaw tribe called the 'Piankeshaw Deed'. Soon after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, however, Dunmore was forced to flee Virginia, and the companies were compelled to turn to new officials for recognition of its purchases. Merger and American denial of title Founding Father James Wilson unsuccessfully advocated the interests of the United Illinois and Wabash Land Company. During the war the British had sparsely garrisoned the Illinois Country, which was far away from the main area of action. In July 1778, Colonel George Rogers Clark and a small force took possession of the region on behalf of Virginia, which, by virtue of its colonial charter, had a claim to the entire Illinois Country. In December of that year, Murray presented a memorial to the Virginia legislature, informing them of the land claims of the Illinois and Wabash companies. In order to consolidate their lobbying efforts, the two companies merged on March 13, 1779, becoming the United Illinois and Wabash Land Company. The cause of the company was promoted by influential Americans such as James Wilson and Robert Morris, who had become investors. Other notable members included Silas Deane, Samuel Chase, and Maryland governor Thomas Johnson. Despite these political connections, Virginia declined to recognize the Illinois-Wabash purchases and instead created the \\"County of Illinois\\" in November 1779. Thus rejected, the company turned its efforts to lobbying the new national government of the United States. This issue became part of a wider debate in Congress about the western boundaries of states, with the states without western lands demanding that Virginia and other states with large land claims cede these lands to the national government. Virginia ceded her western land claims to the United States in 1784. Despite repeated appeals by the Illinois-Wabash Company, which were regularly renewed into the early 19th century, the U.S. government declined to recognize their land claims. The company faded away. The United States eventually bought the lands in question from Native Americans in treaties conducted by William Henry Harrison. After the War of 1812, the United States began to issue land patents to settlers. In 1820, the executor of the estate of an investor in the Illinois-Wabash Company filed suit against William McIntosh, one of the largest of the new landowners. The lawsuit claimed that McIntosh had bought land rightfully owned by the Illinois-Wabash Company, based on the earlier purchase from the Indians. In 1823, the issue made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court in Johnson v. M'Intosh. The Court decided in favor of McIntosh, ruling that private purchases of native lands were not valid. The decision brought to an end the story of the Illinois- Wabash Company. References *Abernethy, Thomas Perkins. Western Lands and the American Revolution. Originally published 1937.

Historically the Rasht Valley has been called Karotegin or Karategin. During the 1992-1997 Tajikistan Civil War, the region was a stronghold for forces opposed to the government of Emomalii Rahmon and became the site of numerous battles. Notably, four members of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan were murdered in the Garm district in 1998.https://fas.org/irp/threat/terror_98/eurasia.htm From the 1920s until 1955 the Rasht Valley was within the Gharm Oblast. History Karotegin is the historic name of the Rasht Valley and a historic political region in pre- Soviet Central Asia that is today part of Tajikistan. The Karotegin region was also named Garm, though Garm is also the name of a city and the Garmi ethnic group. Karotegin frequently appears in its alternative spellings,Qaratagin, Qarategin,Qaratigin, Karategin, Karatigin and Karateghin, in literature from the 1990s and earlier. Karategin was an independent region in Central Asia for many centuries. The native princes, who claimed to be descended from Alexander the Great, were independent until 1868, although their allegiance was claimed in an ineffective way by Kokand. The Emirate of Bukhara took advantage of internal political feuds and conquered the region, along with Darvaz, in 1877. The Karotegin consisted of a highland district bounded on the north by Samarkand and Kokand, on the east by Ferghana, on the south by Darvaz and on the west by Hissar and other Bokharian provinces. Traditionally rough woolen cloth and mohair were woven by the natives, who also made excellent firearms and other weapons. Gold was mined in various places and there were salt-pits in the mountains. The chief town, Garm, situated on a hill on the right bank of the Vakhsh River, was a place of some 2,000 inhabitants, . The population was about 60,000 in 1911; five-sixths were composed of Tajiks while the remainder were Kyrgyz, who reside in what is today the Jirgatol district of Tajikistan. Historically it was difficult for the people of the Karotegin to communicate with neighboring lands except between the months of May and September. The 1949 Khait earthquake resulted in the Khait landslide, which killed over 30,000 people.

It produces and designs luxury notebooks, as well as planners, sketchbooks, leather backpacks, journals, wallets, various accessories, and stationery. Moleskine's notebooks are stylised to follow the aesthetics of a 'traditional' black notebook with rounded corners and ivory-coloured paper. They are bound in cardboard with a sewn spine that allows the notebook to lie flat. An elastic band is used to seal, and a ribbon bookmark is included along with an expandable pocket inside the rear cover, which is packed in a paper banderole. Bruce Chatwin's name is used to sell Moleskine notebooks. Chatwin wrote in The Songlines of little black oilskin-covered notebooks that he bought in Paris and called \\"moleskines\\". The name Moleskine does not have an official pronunciation in any language other than Italian.  History  In the mid-1990s, Maria Sebregondi pitched the idea of resurrecting the iconic notebooks to the company Modo & Modo, despite the shelves of stationery stores already being stocked with blank books at the time. As a result, Modo & Modo trademarked the Moleskine brand and began production of 5,000 notebooks, officially reintroducing them in 1997. By 1998, Modo & Modo were producing 30,000 notebooks a year and expanded their market, distributing their products across Europe. By 2000 Modo & Modo SpA had an office with a small staff and sales of ‚Ç¨20M ($26M) in Milan. In 2004, Moleskine notebooks were exported to Japan, and from there, distribution to Asia began. In 2006, the company was purchased by the European private equity firm now known as Syntegra Capital. At that time, it was reported that the company‚Äôs small staff was unable to keep up with demand. In August 2006, the French investment fund Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Capital purchased Modo & Modo SpA, and invested in its expansion. The company name changed to Moleskine Srl. In 2011 Moleskine extended its production to new categories, creating writing, reading, and travelling collections, launched at the Milan Design Week. Most of the objects in these new collections were designed by Italian industrial designer Giulio Iacchetti, and focused more on accessories surrounding reading and writing than paper goods. By July 2012, Moleskine collections were distributed in 22,000 stores across 95 countries. In March 2013 the company announced an IPO at the Borsa Italiana. Moleskine became a joint-stock company and is now Moleskine SpA; it is still headquartered in Milan. At the end of September 2016, the Belgian investment group D'Ieteren acquired a 41% stake in Moleskine. After having launched a public takeover offer on the remaining shares of the company, D'Ieteren crossed the 95% threshold, which gives it the right to launch a squeeze out procedure in order to gain full control of Moleskine. D'Ieteren's intention is to delist Moleskine from the Milan Stock Exchange. Products = Notebooks = Moleskine notebook Moleskine's notebooks are based on notebooks distributed in Paris during the 19th-20th centuries, handmade by small French bookbinders who supplied the local stationery shops around the turn of the 20th century. They are fashioned after author Bruce Chatwin's descriptions of the notebooks he used. Moleskine items are designed in Italy with most of them being printed, stitched, and assembled in China; this has been criticised by Moleskine customers. Since 2008, some components have been manufactured in Volant, Cahiers and Folio hard covers in Turkey, watercolour paper in France, and some components in Vietnam. The paper used in Moleskine products is Forest Stewardship Council certified and acid-free. Since August 2010, all Moleskine products, offered to retailers in California and throughout the world, comply with the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. After concerns in 2008 about PVC traces in some notebooks, all items are now PVC-free. = Digital = Moleskine manufactures device covers that emulate the trademarked notebooks. In August 2012 Moleskine partnered with Evernote to produce a digital-friendly notebook with specially designed pages and stickers for smartphone syncing.\\"Evernote Moleskine notebook review: When digital and analog elegantly collide\\", The Next Web, 20 October 2012. In October the same year, Moleskine forayed into print on demand with Photo Books, a collaboration with publisher Milk that lets users upload their own photos into a Moleskine notebook-style album.\\"Moleskine and Milk‚Äôs Personalized Photo Books Are Unsurprisingly Sleek\\" Gizmodo.com, 2 October 2012. In 2016, Moleskine launched The Smart Writing Set with Evernote and Livescribe. The notebook costs approximately $200 and is able to automatically transfer notes from the notebook onto a laptop or smartphone. Timepage Timepage is a mobile planner and calendar app developed by Moleskine. It organizes events from calendars on mobile devices and syncs information, contact info, and weather forecasting. The app includes a Heat map calendar and timeline, and has included access to Uber.  Communities  The Moleskine brand is supported by worldwide communities of enthusiasts who write, sketch, paint and draw on Moleskine notebooks. Communities often share images of decorated pages through blogs, social networks or photo and video sharing sites as well as Moleskine's own service \\"MyMoleskine\\", through which customers can interact with company staff.

The RTC also provides a commuter service that transports passengers from the Centennial Hills Transit Center and Park & Ride in the northwest, to Downtown, the Strip, and ends at the UNLV campus in the southeast. The Street Car RTV vehicles travel in dedicated lanes where possible, with less frequent stops than fixed-route transit, enabling the service to change routes based on traffic patterns and move passengers longer distances in a shorter time period than fixed-route bus service. The bus rapid transit system is a seamless network of links throughout the Las Vegas Valley to various connection points of other transportation lines with more frequent stops and will have many rail-like features such as level platform boarding and multiple doors for easy loading. Riders wait at new, comfortable, and modern shelters that will complement the bus rapid transit experience. To help reduce wait times, you are able to purchase a Transit Pass off of the vehicle. This new rapid transit system has the appearance and feel of a light rail transit network at a considerably lower cost. Security Security on the residential, express, and strip transit routes, and all RTC terminals and select platforms is provided by the private security firm Allied-Barton under contract to the RTC. The previous contract holder was Wackenhut Security (now G4S) until losing the contract in 2009. Since then, increased crime in the Las Vegas Metropolitan areahttp://www.cityrating.com/crime-statistics/nevada/las-vegas.html has prompted an increased security presence in the transit system as a whole. The officers‚Äô primary task is that of fare enforcement, but will also engage in enforcing other RTC policies and rules, to include the removal of loiters, those causing disturbances, and those posing safety hazards at RTC stops and facilities, and insuring the general safety of staff and customers.

It catalyzes this formation by removing the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring of nucleoside diphosphates. This reduction produces deoxyribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides in turn are used in the synthesis of DNA. The reaction catalyzed by RNR is strictly conserved in all living organisms. Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair. A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action. The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (deoxythymidine diphosphate) is synthesized by another enzyme (thymidylate kinase) from dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate).  Structure  Ribonucleotide reductases are divided into three classes. Class I RNR enzymes are constructed from large alpha subunit and small beta subunits which associate to form an active heterodimeric tetramer. By reducing NDPs to 2'-dNDPs, the enzyme catalyses the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), which are precursors to DNA synthesis and essential for cell proliferation. Class II RNRs produce a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical by homolytic cleavage of the C-Co bond in adenosylcobalamin. In addition, Class III RNRs contain a stable glycyl radical. Humans carry Class I RNRs. The alpha subunit is encoded by the RRM1 gene while there are two isoforms of the beta subunit, encoded by the RRM2 and RRM2B genes: { - valign=top    } Each Class I alpha monomer consists of three domains: * one mainly helical domain comprising the 220 N-terminal residues, * a second large ten-stranded Œ±/Œ≤ structure comprising 480 residues, * and a third small five-stranded Œ±/Œ≤ structure comprising 70 residues. In Pfam, the second domain has been interpreted as two separate domains: * a shorter all-alpha N-terminal domain, * and a longer barrel C-terminal domain. { - valign=top     } The Class I beta subunit usually contains a di-metal center and a stable tyrosyl radical. In humans, the beta subunit relies on a di-iron cofactor. In E. coli, the tyrosyl radical is located at position 122 (Y122) providing the stable radical for the Class I RNR2 subunits. In A. aegypti, this tyrosyl radical is located at position 184 (Y184). The tyrosyl radical is deeply buried inside the protein in a hydrophobic environment, located close to the iron center that is used in the stabilization of a tyrosyl radical. The structure of two Œº-oxo-linked irons is dominated by ligands that serve as iron binding sites: four carboxylates [aspartate (D146), glutamate (E177, E240, and E274)] and two histidines (H180 and H277). Association occurs between the C-terminus of RNR2 and the C-terminus of RNR1. Enzymatic activity is dependent on association of the RNR1 and RNR2 subunits. The active site consists of the active dithiol groups from the RNR1 as well as the diferric center and the tyrosyl radical from the RNR2 subunit. Other residues of RNR2, such as aspartate (D273), tryptophan (W48), and tyrosine (Y356) further stabilize the active-site tyrosyl radical thus allowing electron transfer. These residues help in the transfer of the radical electron from tyrosine (Y122) of RNR2 to cysteine (C439) of RNR1. The electron transfer begins on RNR2 tyrosine (Y122) and continues in RNR2 to tryptophan (W48), which is separated from RNR1 tyrosine (Y731) by 2.5 nanometers. Electron transfer from RNR2 to RNR1 occurs via tyrosine (Y356 to Y731) and continues on through tyrosine (Y730) to cysteine (C439) in the active site. Site-directed mutations of the RNR primary structure indicate that all residues cited above participate in the long distance transfer of the free radical to the active site. In A. aegypti mosquitoes, RNR1 retains most of the crucial amino acid residues, including aspartate (D64) and valine (V292 or V284), that are necessary in allosteric regulation; proline (P210 and P610), leucine (L453 and L473), and methionine (M603) residues that are located in the hydrophobic active site; cysteine (C225, C436 and C451) residues that are involved in removal of a hydrogen atom and transfer of the radical electron at the active site; cysteine (C225 and C436), asparagine (N434), and glutamate (E441) residues that bind the ribonucleotide substrate; tyrosine (Y723 and Y743) residues that dictate the radical transfer; and cysteine (C838 and C841) residues that are used in the regeneration of dithiol groups in the active site.  Function  Mechanism to catalyze the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. (adapted from Nelson & Cox, 2000). (1) an electron transfer on the RNR2 subunit activates a RNR1 cysteine residue in the active site with a free radical; (2) the free radical forms a stable radical on C-3, and cysteine radical removes a hydrogen atom; (3) cation is formed on C-2 by transferring a hydrogen from a dithiol group and is stabilized by the radical, resulting in the loss of H2O from C-2; (4) a hydrogen is transferred from the dithiol group to reduce the cation C-2; (5) the C-3 radical is reduced by the hydrogen removed in step 2, and the tyrosyl radical is generated; (6) redoxins transfer two hydrogen to the disulfide group that restores the original configuration. The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo synthesis of dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5‚Äô-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2‚Äô-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2‚Äô-deoxy derivative-reduced 2‚Äô-deoxyribonucleoside 5‚Äô-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin. Three classes of RNR have similar mechanisms for the reduction of NDPs, but differ in the domain that generates the free radical, the specific metal in the metalloprotein structure, and the electron donors. All classes use free-radical chemistry. Class I reductases use an iron center with ferrous to ferric conversion to generate a tyrosyl free radical. Reduction of NDP substrates occurs under aerobic conditions. Class I reductases are divided into IA and IB due to differences in regulation. Class IA reductases are distributed in eukaryotes, eubacteria, bacteriophages, and viruses. Class IB reductases are found in eubacteria. Class IB reductases can also use a radical generated with the stabilization of a binuclear manganese center. Class II reductases generate the free radical 5‚Äô-deoxyadenosyl radical from cobalamin (coenzyme B12) and have a simpler structure than class I and class III reductases. Reduction of NDPs or ribonucleotide 5‚Äô-triphosphates (NTPs) occurs under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Class II reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, eubacteria, and bacteriophages. Class III reductases use a glycine radical generated with the help of an S-adenosyl methionine and an iron sulphur center. Reduction of NTPs is limited to anaerobic conditions. Class III reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, eubacteria, and bacteriophages. Organisms are not limited to having one class of enzymes. For example, E. coli have both class I and class III RNR.  Catalytic reduction mechanism  The reaction mechanism of RNR. The mechanism that is currently accepted for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides is depicted in the following scheme. The first step involves the abstraction of the 3‚Äô- H of substrate 1 by radical Cys439. Subsequently, the reaction involves the elimination of one water molecule from carbon C-2‚Äô of the ribonucleotide, catalyzed by Cys225 and Glu441. In the third step there is a hydrogen atom transfer from Cys225 to carbon C-2‚Äô of the 2‚Äô-ketyl radical 3, after previous proton transfer from Cys462 to Cys225. At the end of this step, a radical anionic disulfide bridge and the closed-shell ketone intermediate 4 are obtained. This intermediate has been identified during the conversion of several 2‚Äô-substituted substrate analogues, as well as with the natural substrate interacting with enzyme mutants. The next step is the oxidation of the anionic disulfide bridge, with concomitant reduction of the substrate, generating 5. The spin density shifts from the sulphur atoms to the C-3' atom of the substrate, with simultaneous proton transfer from Glu441 to carbon C-3'. The last step is the reverse of the first step and involves a hydrogen transfer from Cys439 to C-3‚Äô, regenerating the initial radical and resulting in the final product 6. Theoretical models of some steps of these mechanisms using the full model of the R1 protein can be found at the studies performed by Cerqueira et al..  Regulation  Regulation of class I RNR. Class I RNRs are activated by binding ATP or inactivated by binding dATP to the activity site located on the RNR1 subunit. When the enzyme is activated, substrates are reduced if the corresponding effectors bind to the allosteric substrate specificity site. A = when dATP or ATP is bound at the allosteric site, the enzyme accepts UDP and CDP into the catalytic site; B = when dGTP is bound, ADP enters the catalytic site; C = when dTTP is bound, GDP enters the catalytic site. The substrates (ribonucleotides UDP, CDP, ADP, and GDP) are converted to dNTPs by a mechanism involving the generation of a free radical. Class I RNR comprises RNR1 and RNR2 subunits, which can associate to form a heterodimeric tetramer. RNR1 contains both allosteric sites, mediating regulation of substrate specificity and activity. Depending on the allosteric configuration, one of the four ribonucleotides binds to the active site. Regulation of RNR is designed to maintain balanced quantities of dNTPs. Binding of effector molecules either increases or decreases RNR activity. When ATP binds to the allosteric activity site, it activates RNR. In contrast, when dATP binds to this site, it deactivates RNR. In addition to controlling activity, the allosteric mechanism also regulates the substrate specificity and ensures the enzyme produces an equal amount of each dNTP for DNA synthesis. In all classes, binding of ATP or dATP to the allosteric site induces reduction of cytidine 5‚Äô-diphosphate (CDP) and uridine 5‚Äô-diphosphate (UDP); 2‚Äô-deoxyguanosine 5‚Äô-triphosphate (dGTP) induces reduction of adenosine 5‚Äô-diphosphate (ADP); and 2‚Äô-deoxythymidine 5‚Äô-triphosphate (dTTP) induces reduction of guanosine 5‚Äô-diphosphate (GDP) (Figure 1). Class IB reductases are not inhibited by dATP because they lack approximately 50 N-terminal amino acids required for the allosteric activity site. Additionally, it is important that the activity of ribonucleotide reductase be under transcriptional and post-transcriptional control because the synthesis of damage-free DNA relies on a balanced pool of deoxyribonucleotides. Eukaryotic cells with class IA reductases have a mechanism of negative control to turn off synthesis of dNTPs as they accumulate. This mechanism protects the cell from toxic and mutagenic effects that can arise from the overproduction of dNTPs because changes in balanced dNTP pools lead to DNA damage and cell death. Although, the overproduction of dNTPs or an unbalanced supply of them can lead to misincorporation of nucleotides into DNA, the supply of dNTPs supply can allow for DNA repair. p53R2 is a small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase that can induce such repair. Changes within this p53 induced R2 homolog can cause depletion in mitochondrial DNA and consequently p53R2 serves a major factor in dNTP supply. RNR may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.  RNR1 and RNR2 inhibitors  Generally Class I RNR inhibitors can be divided in three main groups: translation inhibitors, which block the synthesis of the enzyme; dimerization inhibitors that prevent the association of the two RNR subunits (R1 and R2); and catalytic inhibitors that inactivate the subunit R1 and/or subunit R2. Class I RNR can be inhibited by peptides similar to the C-terminus of RNR2. These peptides can compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1, and as a result RNR1 does not form an enzymatically active complex with RNR2. Although the C-terminus of RNR2 proteins is different across species, RNR2 can interact with RNR1 across species. When the mouse RNR2 C-terminus was replaced with the E. coli RNR2 C-terminal (7 or 33) amino acid residues, the chimeric RNR2 subunit still binds to mouse RNR1 subunits. However, they lack enzymatic activity due probably to the elimination of residues involved in the transfer of the free radical electron from the RNR2 to the RNR1 subunit. Small peptides can specifically inhibit the RNR2 subunits from binding with RNR1 when they share a significant similarity with the normal RNR2 C-terminus. This inhibition RNR2 binding to RNR1 has been tested successfully in herpes simplex virus (HSV) RNR. When a 7 amino acid oligomer (GAVVNDL) truncated from the C-terminus of the RNR2 subunit was used in competition assays, it prevented the normal RNR2 from forming an enzymatically active complex with RNR1. Other small peptide inhibitors similar to the RNR2 C-terminus have also been used successfully to inhibit HSV RNR enzymatic activity and thus HSV replication. In mice models of stromal keratitis and corneal neovascularization (HSV ocular disease), a small RNR2 C-terminal analog BILD 1263 has been reported to inhibit RNR and is effective in preventing these diseases. In some cases, although treatment with small C-terminal analogs may not stop disease spreading, they can still help in healing. In the acyclovir-resistant HSV (PAAr5), a small peptide inhibitor BILD 1633 has been reported to be 5 to 10 times more potent than BILD 1263 against cutaneous PAAr5 infection. A combination therapy approach (BILD 1633 and acyclovir) is more effective to heal topical lesions in mice. These data suggest that small peptide inhibitors that compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1 are useful in preventing the spread of HSV. Gallium inhibits RNR2 by substituting for Fe3+ in the active site. Gallium maltolate is an orally bioavailable form of gallium that exploits this inhibitory activity to treat cancer, infections, and other diseases. The drugs hydroxyurea and Motexafin gadolinium interfere with the action of this enzyme.

It drains in a remote and scenic area of wilderness in the Maine North Woods north of Mount Katahdin. The name \\"Allagash\\" comes from the Abenaki language, a dialect of the Algonquin languages, spoken by the Penobscot Tribe [URL http://www.native-languages.org/abna.htm.][URL https://www.britannica.com/topic/Algonquian-languages] The word, /walak√©sk ∏iht…ôk ∏/, means \\"bark stream\\". The Allagash issues from Churchill Lake (formerly known as Heron Lake) at Churchill Depot in northern Piscataquis County. In its natural state, it also drained Allagash, Chamberlain, and Telos lakes, but in the 1840s dams were built which diverted their drainage into the East Branch of the Penobscot River, to facilitate the shipping of logs south to coastal Maine. Lock Dam drains some water from Chamberlain Lake into the south end of Eagle Lake, which then flows out through the Allagash as it naturally would. Extending the flowline of the Allagash River to Lock Dam on Chamberlain Lake gives a total length to the mouth of the Allagash at the Saint John River of . The Allagash flows generally northeast, passing through a chain of natural mountain lakes. It joins the Saint John from the south at Allagash, Maine, near the international border with New Brunswick. The relatively unspoiled nature of the river has long made it a popular destination for canoe trips. In 1857 Henry David Thoreau, along with his Concord friend Edward S. Hoar and Penobscot guide Joseph Polis, made a canoe journey which led him to the source of the river, i.e. Heron Lake. His account of the excursion called \\"The Allegash and East Branch\\" was published posthumously as the third chapter of The Maine Woods (1864). Allagash Falls In 1966, the citizens of Maine voted to protect the river by authorizing a $1.5 million bond that would \\"develop the maximum wilderness character\\" of the river. Much of the river was subsequently designated as the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. In 1970 the waterway became part of the National Wild and Scenic River program of the U.S. federal government. Although the wild designation of the river is normally applied to free-flowing streams, the designation left in place the wooden Churchill Dam for historic reasons. In the 1990s, with the dam failing, the citizens of Maine authorized a concrete replacement for the dam to preserve the nearby recreational facilities on the river. The rebuilding of the dam was highly criticized by environmentalists. The expansion of recreational access to the river through new roads and docks has remained a controversial topic in recent years. Development in much of the area surrounding the Allagash Wilderness Waterway is restricted by the Seven Islands Land Company, a private land management company that owns approximately 1 million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of forest in northern Maine. The United States government maintains one stream gauge on the Allagash, located above the river's mouth near Allagash, Maine (), at which point the watershed is . The river's discharge (flow) at this gauge averages , with a recorded maximum of and minimum of . Annual maximum flows occur during the spring snow melt and minimums in the fall.

During Soviet times Khatlon was divided into Kurgan-Tyube (Qurghonteppa) Oblast (Western Khatlon) ‚Äì with the Kofarnihon and Vakhsh river valleys ‚Äì and Kulob Oblast (Eastern Khatlon) ‚Äì with the Kyzylsu and Yakhsu river valleys. Both regions were merged in November 1992 into today's Khatlon Region (or viloyat). The capital is the city of Qurghonteppa, formerly known as Kurgan-Tyube.Borjian, H., ‚ÄúKhatlon‚Äù, Encyclopaedia Iranica. Volume 16, Issue 4, 2018, pp. 437-439. Khatlon has an area of 24,700 square kilometres and consists of 21 districts and 4 district- level cities. The total population of Khatlon in 2020 was 3,348,300, up from 2,677,251 in the 2010 population census. The population in Khatlon is mainly engaged in Agriculture. History During the Soviet era, Khatlon became one of the two main cotton regions in Tajikistan. The other one is in Sughd (Leninabad). Collectivisation of agriculture was implemented aggressively in the early 1930s, to expand the extent of cotton cultivation in Tajikistan as a whole, with particular emphasis on the southern part of the republic. The process included violations against peasants, substantial expansion of the irrigation network, and forcible resettlement of mountain peoples and people from Uzbekistan to the lowlands.Muriel Atkin. Tajikistan in: Glenn E. Curtis (ed.): Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, Country Studies, Washington: 1997. pp. 197‚Äì290. The results of this policy are to be seen in the ethnic composition of Salua oblast as well as in the fact that the Tajik population identifies themselves either as Gharmis (resettled from the mountains) or Kulobis. These groups never melted, and fought against each other during the Civil War in Tajikistan. Khatlon oblast suffered the heaviest damage in Tajikistan. Since the conflicts leading to the civil war were never really resolved, tensions in the region still exist. The eastern part ‚Äì Kulob ‚Äì is home to the president and his clan and has thus gained a lot of political influence. During Soviet times, the region cooperated with the then ruling elite from Leninabad, and was responsible for the militia, the army and the security forces. Kulob is regarded as a very conservative region. In the capital Qurghonteppa and parts of Kulob, the Islamic opposition has a lot of support among the Garmis.Borjian, Habib, Kurgan Tepe, Encyclopaedia Iranica Online The Kulyab clan is based in Khatlon.Ethnic groups at risk: The status of Tajiks Heritage Society In February 1996 Colonel Mahmud Khudoiberdiyev launched a rebellion, insisting that three officials from the Kulyab clan resign before he ended the rebellion. The government complied. Additionally, Prime Minister Dzhamshed Karimov and Abudzhalil Khamidov, the Chairman of the Leninabad Oblast executive committee, resigned.Tajikistan: Central Asian Powderkeg The Jamestown Foundation Administrative divisions The Khatlon Region is subdivided into 21 districts and 4 district-level cities: Kulob, Levakant, Norak and Qurghonteppa.

Khujand is one of the oldest cities in Central Asia, dating back about 2,500 years. Situated on the Syr Darya river at the mouth of the Fergana Valley, Khujand was a major city along the ancient Silk Road. Captured by Alexander the Great in 329 BCE, it has been part of various empires in history, including the Umayyad Caliphate (8th century), the Mongol Empire (13th century) and the Russian empire (19th century). Today, the majority of its population are ethnic Tajiks and the city is close to the present borders of both Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. History Market Square of Khujand in 1860s Historical Museum of Sughd = Antiquity = Khujand may have been the site of Cyropolis () which was established when king Cyrus the Great founded the city during his last expedition against the Saka tribe of Massagetae shortly before his death. Alexander the Great later built his furthest Greek settlement near Cyropolis in 329 BCE and named it Alexandria Eschate (Greek: ·ºàŒªŒµŒæŒ¨ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµŒπŒ± ·ºòœÉœáŒ¨œÑŒ∑) or \\"Alexandria The Furthest\\".Prevas, John. (2004). Envy of the Gods: Alexander the Great's Ill- Fated Journey across Asia, p. 121. Da Capo Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts . The city would form a bastion for the Greek settlers against the nomadic Scythian tribes who lived north of the Syr Darya River. According to the Roman writer Curtius, Alexandria Ultima (Alexandria the Furthest) retained its Hellenistic culture as late as 30 BCE. The city became a major staging point on the northern Silk Road. It also became a cultural hub and several famous poets and scientists came from this city. = Post-classical = In the early 8th century, Khujand was captured by the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, under Qutayba ibn Muslim. The city was incorporated into the Umayyad and subsequent Abbasid Caliphates, and a process of Islamicization began. In the late 9th century, however, it reverted to local rule and was incorporated into the Samanid Empire. It came under the rule of the Kara-Khanid Khanate in 999 and after the division of Kara Khanids in 1042, it was initially part of Eastern Kara Khanids, and then later passed to the western one. Karakhitans conquered it in 1137, but it passed to Khwarazmshahs in 1211. In 1220, it strongly resisted the Mongol hordes and was thus laid to waste. In the 14th century, the city was part of the Chagatai Khanate until it was incorporated into the Timurid Dynasty' in the late 14th century, under which it flourished greatly. The Shaybanid dynasty of Bukhara next annexed Khojand, until it was taken over by the Kokand Khanate in 1802, however, Bukhara regained it in 1842 until it was lost a few decades later to Russia. = Russian Empire = In 1866, as most of Central Asia was occupied by Russian Empire, the city became part of the General Governorate of Turkestan, under Tsarist Russia. The threat of forced conscription during World War I led to protests in the city in July 1916, which turned violent when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers.A Country Study: Tajikistan, Tajikistan under Russian Rule, Library of Congress Call Number DK851 .K34 1997 = Soviet Union = During the initial period of Soviet power in Central Asia, Khujand was part of the Turkestan ASSR that was created in 1918. When the latter was dismantled in 1924 on the principle of national delimitation, the city became a part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1929, the previously created Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (contained within the Uzbek SSR) was upgraded to union-level republic as the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, and in order to gain a sufficient number of inhabitants (preferably from the titular ethnic group) the city of Khujand and the surrounding area, inhabited mainly by ethnic Tajiks, was transferred by Soviet Communists from Uzbek SSR to the Tajik SSR, The city was renamed Leninabad on 10 January 1936 and it remained part of the Soviet Union until 1991. Masjidi Jami Mosque Now a part of the Tajik SSR, Khujand/Leninabad became the second-largest city in the republic, though the city's location within the historically more urban, prosperous, and commercially central Fergana Valley and a long history of being a densely populated urban centre meant that Khujand and its region were sometimes viewed as more developed and cosmopolitan than the newly designated capital and boom-town of Dushanbe/Stalinabad (the latter was a small town of 6,000 when the Tajik SSR was created in 1926 and had reached over 200,000 inhabitants ten years later). = Post-Soviet period and independence = It reverted to its original name in 1992 after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the independence of Tajikistan, and the city continued to be the second-largest city in the nation. In 1996 the city experienced the Ashurov protests during which citizens called for the President, Emomali Rakhmonov to step down. The popular protests were followed by a protest from the city's prisoners, many of whom had been sentenced to long jail terms for minor crimes and who were living in poor conditions. The protest led to the Khujand prison riot in which between 24 and 150 prisoners were killed. In the early 2000s many residents of Khujand had little to no access to water, and what water they did have was unsafe to drink and had to be boiled. In 2004, The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development joined to help improve the situation, providing 32,000 water meters for inhabitants and developing improved access to water. Residents pay for their water supply, which in turn helps Khujand's municipal water company to continue to renovate and improve their services. The project is in its third stage of development and was to be completed by 2017. In comparison to other Central Asian projects aiming to improve access to water, this project is considered a success and has been applied to Kyrgyz cities and towns such as Osh, Jalal-Abad, Karabalta, and Talas, with a possible extension into the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek.International Crisis Group. \\"Water Pressures in Central Asia\\", CrisisGroup.org. 11 September 2014.

The 5-km tunnel, located 80 km northwest of Dushanbe and built with assistance from Iran, is also a transit route between Dushanbe and the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Previously, particularly during cold seasons, the lack of a direct link between northern and southern Tajikistan often led to disruptions of commercial activities in the region Education The city is home to Khujand State University, Tajikistan State University of Law, Business, & Politics, Polytechnical Institute of Technical University of Tajikistan, and Khujand Medical College as well as 2-year technical colleges. Secondary education is funded by the state except for when administered at private institutions. Higher education in universities and colleges is subsidized by the Tajik Ministry of Education. Demographics Khujand is mainly inhabited by ethnic Tajiks. Results of population census carried out in 2010: Tajiks ‚Äì 84%, Uzbeks ‚Äì 14%, Russians ‚Äì 0.4%, and others ‚Äì 1.6%.

The gentle free-flowing river is a popular destination for recreational canoeing and kayaking, as well as recreational fishing and crabbing. The river has also become a hotspot for water sports such as wakeboarding and water skiing due to its consistently smooth surface.

This unconscious is another name for the diversity of social, economic, cultural and other unspoken elements that an educator interacts with in an institutional setting; and 2. the role of the institution in the process of intervening in both those psycho-social factors and in what is known by a student. But even more than this, as conceived by its founder, Fernand Oury, Institutional Pedagogy is a constant calling into question of the institutional context itself. Thus the classroom is never a presupposed and static setting. The movement of Institutional Pedagody is thus in direct opposition to the prevailing trends of education prior to the late 1960s, almost all of which tended to homogenize socio-cultural differences amongst learners, psycho-social factors in learning and most important the presence of the \\"unconscious\\" in the classroom itself. Thus the use of 'institution' in Institutional Pedagogy is broader than in its more colloquial sense. To Oury the institution could be defined as: \\"the places, moments, status of each according to his/her level of performance, that is to say according to his/her potentialities, the functions (services, posts, responsibilities), roles (president, secretary), diverse meetings (team captains, different levels of classes, etc.), and the rituals that maintain their efficacy.\\"  See also  *Popular education *Institutional psychotherapy Bibliography *Oury, Fernand and A√Øda Vasquez.

The DCCC recruits candidates, raises funds, and organizes races in districts that are expected to yield politically notable or close elections. The structure of the committee consists, essentially, of the Chairperson (who according to current Democratic Caucus rules is a fellow member of the Caucus appointed by the party leader in the House), their staff, and other Democratic members of Congress that serve in roles supporting the functions of the committee. The Chairperson of the DCCC is the fifth-ranking position among House Democrats, after the Majority Leader, the Majority Whip, the House Assistant Democratic Leader, and the Democratic Caucus Chairperson. The current chair is Cheri Bustos of Illinois, who assumed the position in 2019.  History  The DCCC originated in 1866 as the Democratic National Congressional Committee. Due to the reform of campaign finance legislation that took effect in the 2004 election cycle, the DCCC splits into two organizations a few months before each Election Day: # One organization (the \\"Coordinated\\" campaign) can continue to stay in contact with the individual congressional campaigns, offering advice and suggestions to candidates and their staffs in each race. # The other organization (the \\"Independent Expenditure\\" campaign), which makes independent expenditures in congressional districts on behalf of the campaigns, is not allowed to coordinate activities with the campaigns. In recent elections, the DCCC has played an expansive role in supporting Democratic candidates with independently produced television ads and mail pieces. Rahm Emanuel assumed the position of DCCC committee chair after the death of the previous chair, Bob Matsui, at the end of the 2004 election cycle. Emanuel led the Democratic Party's successful effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. After Emanuel's election as chair of the Democratic Caucus, Chris Van Hollen became committee chair for the 110th Congress and the 2008 elections. He continued through the 2010 elections. For the 2014 election cycle, Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appointed congressman Ben Ray Luj√°n to serve as the committee's chair.  Alleged Russian hacking  In July 2016, the DCCC said it was hacked. Subsequently, a person described as a hacker and known as \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" (Russian Main Intelligence Directorate persona) reportedly released documents and information that were obtained from the cyberattack on the DCCC.

Founded by Louis Brandt in La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1848, the company formally operated as La Generale Watch Co. until incorporating the name Omega in 1903, becoming Louis Brandt et Fr√®re - Omega Watch & Co.. In 1982, the company officially changed its name to Omega SA, which is currently a subsidiary of the Swiss Swatch Group. Omega opened its museum to the public in Biel/Bienne in January 1984. Britain's Royal Flying Corps chose Omega watches in 1917 as its official timekeepers for its combat units, as did the U.S. Army in 1918. Omega watches were the choice of NASA and the first watch on the Moon in 1969. In addition, Omega has been the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games since 1932. James Bond has worn it in films since 1995; other famous Omega wearers, past and present, include Buzz Aldrin, George Clooney, John F. Kennedy, Mao Zedong, Elvis Presley and Prince William. History = Early history = The workbench of Louis Brandt with a photograph of the founder The forerunner of Omega, La Generale Watch Co., was founded at La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1848 by Louis Brandt, who assembled key-wound precision pocket watches from parts supplied by local craftsmen. He sold his watches from Italy to Scandinavia by way of England, his chief market. In 1894, his two sons Louis- Paul and C√©sar developed a revolutionary in-house manufacturing and total production control system that allowed component parts to be interchangeable. Watches developed with these techniques were marketed under the Omega brand of La Generale Watch Co. By 1903 the success of the Omega brand led the La Generale Watch Co to spin off the Omega brand as its own company, and the Omega Watch Co was officially founded in 1903. = Re-organization = Louis- Paul and C√©sar Brandt both died in 1903, leaving one of Switzerland's largest watch companies ‚Äî with 240,000 watches produced annually and employing 800 people ‚Äî in the hands of four young people, the oldest of whom, Paul-Emile Brandt, was not yet 24. Brandt was the great architect and builder of Omega.Richon, Marco. 2007 Omega: A Journey through Time. His influence would be felt over the next half-century. The economic difficulties brought on by the First World War would lead him to work actively from 1925 toward the union of Omega and Tissot, then to their merger in 1930 into the group SSIH, Geneva. Under Brandt's leadership and Joseph Reiser's from 1955, the SSIH Group continued to grow and multiply, absorbing or creating some fifty companies, including Lanco and Lemania, manufacturer of the most famous Omega chronograph movements. By the 1970s, SSIH had become Switzerland's number one producer of finished watches and number three in the world. Up to this time, the Omega brand outsold Rolex, its main Swiss rival in the luxury watch segment, although Rolex watches sold at a higher price point. Around this time it was viewed as Rolex versus Omega in the competition for the \\"King of Swiss Watch brands\\". Omega watches tended to be more revolutionary and more professionally focused, while Rolex watches were more ‚Äòevolutionary‚Äô and famous for their mechanical pieces and brand. While Omega and Rolex had dominated in the pre- quartz era, this changed in the 1970s during the quartz crisis. That was when Japanese watch manufacturers such as Seiko and Citizen rose to dominance due to their pioneering of quartz movement. In response, Rolex continued concentrating on its expensive mechanical chronometers where its expertise lay (though it did have some experimentation in quartz), while Omega tried to compete with the Japanese in the quartz watch market with Swiss made quartz movements. = Recent development = Omega Seamaster De Ville, an early \\"waterproof\\" watch, with automatic movement and date, in 14k gold Weakened by the severe monetary crisis and recession of 1975 to 1980, SSIH was bailed out by the banks in 1981. During this period, Seiko expressed interest in acquiring Omega, but nothing came out of the talks. Switzerland's other watch making giant Allgemeine Schweizerische Uhrenindustrie AG (ASUAG - supplier of a large range of Swiss movements and watch assemblies) was in economic difficulty. It was the principal manufacturer of √âbauche (unfinished movements) and owner, through their sub-holding company General Watch Co (GWC), of various other Swiss watch brands including Longines, Rado, Certina, Hamilton Watch Company and Mido. After drastic financial restructuring, the R&D; departments of ASUAG and SSIH merged production operations at the ETA complex in Granges. The two companies completely merged forming ASUAG-SSIH, a holding company, in 1983. Two years later this holding company was taken over by a group of private investors led by Nicolas Hayek. Renamed SMH, Soci√©t√© de Micro√©lectronique et d'Horlogerie, this new group over the next decade proceeded to become one of the top watch producers in the world.According to the DowJones Market Bulletin of January 18, 2008. In 1998 it became the Swatch Group, which now manufactures Omega and other brands such as Blancpain, Swatch, and Breguet. Omega's brand experienced a resurgence with advertisement that focused on product placement strategies, such as in the James Bond 007 films; the character had previously worn a Rolex Submariner but switched to the Omega Seamaster Diver 300M with GoldenEye (1995) and has stayed with the latter ever since until swapping it for the Omega Planet Ocean and Aqua Terra. Omega also adopted many elements of Rolex's business model (i.e. premium pricing, tighter controls of dealer pricing, increasing advertising, etc.) which was successful in increasing Omega's market share and name recognition to become more of a direct competitor to Rolex.  Motto and slogan  One of Omega's company slogans is \\"Omega ‚Äì Exact time for life\\". The slogan was developed in 1931 based on the company's historical performance at the Observatory trials.  Watch manufacturing  = Notable inventions and patents = 300x300px * In 1892, Louis Brandt, the founder of Omega, manufactured the world's first minute repeating wristwatch in collaboration with Audemars Piguet, which provided the minute-repeating movement. The 18K-gold watch is now kept in the Omega Museum in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland. * In 1947, Omega created the first tourbillon wristwatch calibre in the world with the 30I. Twelve of these movements were made, intended for inclusion in the observatory trials in Geneva, Neuch√¢tel and Kew-Teddington, and they were known as the Omega Observatory Tourbillons. Unlike conventional Tourbillion movement's whose cages rotate once per minute, the 30I's cage rotated one time each seven and a half minutes. In 1949, one of these delivered the best results ever recorded by a wristwatch up to that time. A year later, Omega broke its own record in the Geneva Observatory Trials of 1950. * In 1999, after the successful development of Calibre 2500, Omega made history by introducing the first mass-produced watch incorporating the coaxial escapement ‚Äî invented by English watchmaker George Daniels.Omega Co-Axial 2500 Considered by many to be one of the more significant horological advances since the invention of the lever escapement, the coaxial escapement functions with virtually no lubrication, thereby eliminating one of the shortcomings of the traditional lever escapement.See Europa Star technical notes. Through using radial friction instead of sliding friction at the impulse surfaces the coaxial escapement significantly reduces friction, theoretically resulting in longer service intervals and greater accuracy over time. (archived August 7, 2004) * On January 24, 2007 Omega unveiled its new Calibres 8500 and 8501, two coaxial (25,200 bph) movements created exclusively from inception by Omega. * On January 17, 2013 Omega announced the creation of the world's first movement that is resistant to magnetic fields greater than 1.5 Tesla (15,000 Gauss), far exceeding the levels of magnetic resistance achieved by any previous movement - a similar movement was used by Daniel Craig as James Bond, though the official collectors watch was labelled as resistant to 15,007 Gauss in honor of the fictional secret agent's codename. Most anti-magnetic watches utilize a soft iron - Faraday cage which distributes electromagnetism in such a way that it cancels the effect on the movement contained within. This type of anti-magnetic case required de-magnetizing procedures of the case. Omega has instead built a movement of non-ferrous materials eliminating the need for such a cage and providing a far greater resistance to magnetic fields eliminating necessity of additional maintenance.Omega Watches, OMEGA announces the first truly anti-magnetic watch movement *In 2015, they introduced the Master Chronometer Certification, which denotes that along with a COSC (Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute) certification, a movement has also passed a series of eight tests set out by METAS (The Federal Institute of Metrology). Master Chronometer watches have a minimum water-resistance rating of 100 meters, a minimum power reserve rating of 60 hours, an accuracy rating of 0/+5 seconds per day, and are resistant to magnetic fields of 15,000 gauss. The Master Chronometer Certification debuted on the Globemaster but they now offer it across many more of its watch collections. =Observatory trials= Omega Gen√®ve Cal. 613 Observatory trials focused on the science of Chronometry and the ability to make chronometers measure time precisely. Only Patek Philippe and Omega participated every year in the trials. Omega's performances at these competitions garnered the company a reputation of precision and innovation. For more than a decade (1958 ‚Äì 1969), Omega was the largest manufacturer of COSC chronometers. Omega developed the slogan \\"Omega ‚Äì Exact time for life\\" in 1931 based on its historical performance at the Observatory trials. Omega's early prowess in designing and regulating timing movements was made possible by the company's incorporation of new chronometric innovations. The following are some important reference dates for the Omega precision records: *1894: Creation of the famous 19 caliber named Omega. The company is renamed after this famous caliber in 1903 from 'Louis Brandt et Fr√®res'. Omega participates for the first time at observatory trials in Neuenburg (French: Neuch√¢tel). Albert Willemin, the first \\"regleur de pr√©cision\\" at Omega, regulated the movement. *1911: Albert Willemin leaves Omega and is replaced by Werner-A. Dubois. *1918: Werner-A. Dubois leaves Omega (he joins Paul Ditisheim) and is replaced by Carl Billeter. *1919: 1st Prize at observatory trials in Neuenburg with a 21 caliber. This caliber was slightly modified to become the famous Cal. 47.7 later. *1920: Gottlob Ith replaces Carl Billeter. *1922: Omega participates for the first time at observatory trials in Kew- Teddington (achieved 3rd place). *1925: 1st place at observatory trials in Kew-Teddington with a Cal. 47.7 (95.9 of 100 points ex aequo with Ulysse Nardin); Gottlob Ith regulated the movement. *1929: Alfred Jaccard joined Omega. *1930: 1st place at observatory trials in Kew-Teddington (96.3 of 100 points ex aequo with Movado); Alfred Jaccard regulated the movement. *1931: Omega achieves 1st place in all 6 categories at observatory trials in Geneva; Alfred Jaccard regulated the movements. * 1932: Introduction of the first small wrist Chronograph the Omega 28.9 chronograph *1933: A Cal. 47.7 regulated by Alfred Jaccard achieved the precision record at observatory trials. Kew-Teddington; 97.4 points of 100. *1936: Another Cal. 47.7 regulated by Alfred Jaccard achieved the precision record of 97.8 points of 100. Kew- Teddington. This record was not broken until as late as 1965. *1937: 1st place at Kew-Teddington with 97.3 points. *1938: 1st place at Kew-Teddington with 97.7 points. *1939: Creation of the Cal. 30 (the first 30mm caliber). *1940: 1st place with Cal. 30mm at Kew Teddington; movement regulated by Alfred Jaccard. *1943: Launch of the 30mm caliber 30T2 (first rose gold-plated Omega movement). *1945: 1st place with 30mm caliber at the observatory in Geneva; movement regulated by Alfred Jaccard. *1947: Creation of the first Omega tourbillon wristwatch movement (Cal. 30I). Specially developed for the observatory trials (only 12 pieces made).The distinctive Omega Constellation day-date model of 1980's generation that was known as \\"Manhattan\\" , Equipped with quartz movement Cal.1444 *1948: 1st place at observatory trial in Neuenburg for 30mm caliber. 1st time non-Swiss companies allowed to take part. *1950: 1st place for tourbillon Cal. 30I at Geneva Trials; regulated by Alfred Jaccard. Joseph Ory joins precision timing department after being Trainer to women timers (regleuse). *1951/2:1st place at the observatory trials in Geneva. *1953: Alfred Jaccard died. *1954: New record in Geneva by Gottlob Ith. *1955: Two new records at Neuenburg by Gottlob Ith. *1956: Gottlob Ith died aged 66 years; Joseph Ory takes over as head of department. Two 1st places at observatory trials in Neuenburg. *1958: New record in Geneva movements regulated by Joseph Ory. Creation of competition Cal. 30GD ‚Äì a 30mm caliber with better mainspring and higher frequency (25,200 instead of 18,000 vph). This unusual frequency is used again today for the latest coaxial movements. *1959: Two records in Neuenburg and one new record in Geneva; movements regulated by Joseph Ory. *1960: One new record in Geneva, One new record in Neuenburg and also 1st place in Neuenburg. Movements regulated by Joseph Ory. *1961: Two new records in Geneva by Joseph Ory. The first four places for the 'single pieces' category in Geneva are occupied by Omega. *1962: 2nd, 3rd and 4th places for Omega, which decides to create a new caliber. *1963: Two 1st places in Geneva and Neuenburg. Movements regulated by Joseph Ory and Andr√© Brielmann. *1964: New record in Neuchatel by Joseph Ory. *1965: Omega occupies 2nd to 9th places (1st place goes to Zenith). Pierre Chopard was tasked to create a new Caliber for the observatory trials. Cal. E11 had a very unusual shape to take a very big barrel and its mainspring. It never entered competition because quartz movements arrived in 1967. *1966: Three new records for Omega (two in Neuenburg, one in Geneva). *1967: Quartz movement Beta 1 (later Beta 21) included in the same category as mechanical movements. Last year that Omega competed with mechanical movements as \\"old technology\\" not comparable with quartz. The production watch was released in 1970 as the Omega Electroquartz accurate to 5 seconds per month *1968: Omega enters with a tuning fork movement regulated by Andr√© Brielmann for a new record. *1969: Two new records for the tuning fork movements regulated by Andr√© Brielmann. *1970: One new record for the tuning fork movement regulated by Andr√© Brielmann. *1971: Two new records for the tuning fork movements regulated by Andr√© Brielmann. *1972: Andr√© Brielmann retires. *1974: Omega Marine Chronometer certified as the world's first Marine Chronometer wristwatch, accurate to 12 seconds per year = Environmental rating = Top 5 gold producing nations In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Omega, along with 7 other manufacturers including Patek Philippe, Breguet and Rolex, was given the lowest environmental rating as \\"Latecomers/Non-transparent\\", suggesting that the manufacturer has taken very few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change. There are concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are also top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world's annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies. Notable models = Most expensive pieces = * The Omega wristwatch Ref. H6582/D96043 (1960) once owned by Elvis Presley was sold in auction by Phillips for 1.812 million US dollars in Geneva on May 12, 2018, making it the most expensive Omega timepiece ever sold at auction. The watch was manufactured in 1960 and was sold by Tiffany & Co. in 1961.

Nelson, \\"The Moon Watch: A History of the Omega Speedmaster Professional\\", NAWCC Bulletin, February 1993. All subsequent manned NASA missions also used this handwound wristwatch. NASA started selecting the chronograph in the early 1960s. Automatic chronograph wristwatches were not available until 1969. Even so, all the instrument panel clocks and time-keeping mechanisms in the spacecraft on those space missions were Bulova Accutrons with tuning fork movements, because at the time NASA did not know how well a mechanical movement would work in zero gravity. =First watch on the moon= The Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph was the first watch on the Moon, worn by Buzz Aldrin. Although Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong was first to set foot on the moon, he left his 105.012 Speedmaster inside the Lunar Module as a backup because the LM's electronic timer had malfunctioned. Aldrin elected to wear his and so his Speedmaster became the first watch to be worn on the moon. Armstrong's watch is now displayed at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronographs Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, 2004. Aldrin's was lost. He mentions in his book, Return to Earth, that when donating several items to the Smithsonian Institution, his Omega was one of the few things that was stolen from his personal effects.Alan A. Nelson, \\"The Moon Watch: A History of the Omega Speedmaster Professional\\", NAWCC Bulletin via , February 1993 issue (retrieved on 2007-02-21). In 2007, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph, the Omega company unveiled the commemorative Speedmaster Professional Chronograph Moonwatch. The watch had the distinctive features of the first hand-winding Omega Speedmaster introduced in 1957. It was sold in an edition of 1,957. Sponsorship NCIS In the US television series NCIS, lead actor Mark Harmon wears an Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean with supporting cast member Michael Weatherly wearing a matching version.

The second crown (at 10 o'clock) is a helium release valve to allow helium out of the watch after diving at great depth. The watch is similar to that shown in recent James Bond films, in which this valve is transformed into improbable hidden gadgets. Omega has been associated with James Bond movies since 1995. That year, Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond and began wearing the Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional (model 2541.80.00) in the movie GoldenEye. In all later films, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Chronometer (model 2531.80.00). The producers wanted to update the image of the fictional \\"super-spy\\" to a more distinctly sophisticated \\"Euro\\" look.\\"James Bond's Choice: The Omega Seamaster \\", commanderbond.net, 2004-03-29 (retrieved on 2007-02-21). Another possible reason for the change from the Rolex Submariner that Bond had previously worn was a change in the business environment surrounding modern films and product placement. Omega was eager to participate in high-profile co- promotions/product placement opportunities, especially the James Bond franchise, to further its brand image/awareness. It accomplished this by supplying products and finance (something that the conservative Rolex company avoids, presumably because it sees no benefit for itself).\\"The 007 Connection\\", chronocentric.com (retrieved on 2007-02-21). For the 40th anniversary of James Bond (2002) a commemorative edition of the watch was made available model 2537.80.00 (10,007 units). The watch is identical to the model 2531.80.00 except the blue watch dial had a 007 logo inscribed across it and also machined into the caseback. The band also had 007 inscribed on the clasp.Lara Magzan, \\"The business of Bond...James Bond\\", CNN/Money, 2002-11-25 (retrieved on 2007-02-21). Daniel Craig, the current James Bond since Casino Royale, also wears the Omega Seamaster: the Seamaster Planet Ocean (model 2900.50.91) in the first part of Casino Royale, and the Seamaster Professional 300M (model 2220.80.00) in the latter part (from travelling to Montenegro). He even goes so far as to mention Omega by name when questioned by Vesper Lynd. In connection with the launch of the film, Omega released in 2006 an 007-special of the Professional 300M, (model 2226.80.00) featuring the 007-gun logo on the second hand and the rifle pattern on the watch face, this being a stylized representation of the gun barrel sequence of Bond movies.Devin Zydel, \\"Omega Presents James Bond Exhibition in Geneva \\", Commanderbond.net 2007-01-06 (retrieved on 2007-02-21). Omega released a second James Bond limited edition watch in 2006. This was a Seamaster Planet Ocean model with a limited production of 5007 units.

This model was based on the Planet Ocean Ref: 232.30.42.21.01.004. It featured a textured dial with the 007 logo at the 7 o'clock position, and a 007 decorated rotor visible through the case-back. In 2015 two commemorative models were produced for the 24th Bond film, Spectre: the Omega Seamaster 300m master co-axial Ref: 233.32.41.21.01.001. 7007 units were produced, and came with a NATO strap as well as the standard bracelet. The watch also featured a bi-directional bezel with a world timing scale rather than a diving scale present on the standard 300m. The second timepiece for the film was the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 150m master co-axial Ref: 231.10.42.21.03.004. The watch was decorated with a textured dial based on the Bond family coat of arms, as well as with a rotor resembling a bullet and gun barrel with \\"James Bond\\" inscribed.

Olympic swimmer and multiple gold medalist Michael Phelps is an Omega Ambassador and wears the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean. Omega is also the official timekeeper for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2014 Omega became the official timekeeper of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The brand was a Worldwide Olympic Partner at the 2016 Summer Olympics. After the 2020 Summer Olympics were postponed due to COVID-19, the Tokyo Station's Olympic countdown clock, made by Omega, which was displaying the number of days until the Games, and a local tourist attraction, was halted and switched to show the current date and time. Omega constructed and maintained a monochrome video scoreboard for Milwaukee's County Stadium, the former home of Major League Baseball's Milwaukee Brewers, which was in use from the board's construction in 1980 until the stadium's closure in 2000. Providing support to Emirates Team New Zealand and representing the team's official watch, in 2007 Omega introduced the Seamaster NZL-32 chronograph, with the name suggested by the name of the boat that won the America's Cup in 1995. The watch was developed in cooperation with Dean Barker, skipper of Team New Zealand and Omega Ambassador. On July 1, 2011 Omega became the official timekeeper of PGA of America through the signing of a five-year agreement that was to carry through 2016.

Its first team has won 14 Swiss league championships and six Swiss Cups. YB is one of the most successful Swiss football clubs internationally, reaching the semi- finals of the European Cup in the 1958‚Äì59 season. The club's colours are yellow of a golden shade and black.  History  Chart of BSC Young Boys table positions in the Swiss football league system = 1902‚Äì1925: The early years = The club was founded in 1898. Its name was intended to mimic that of the Basel-based club Old Boys. YB began to be successful very early on. Against Lausanne they celebrated a surprising 2‚Äì2 draw and on 26 October 1902 a 7‚Äì0 victory over Fortuna Basel. In these years YB also came out from the shadow of FC Bern. YB beat their city rivals away 3‚Äì1 and on 8 March 1903 5‚Äì0 at home. YB won the championship of the Central League and were invited to play in the finals of the Swiss championship. On 22 March was the first final against FC Z√ºrich. YB played, among others, the two Schwab brothers, and they beat Zurich 3‚Äì1. On 29 March YB faced the West champion FC Neuch√¢tel. The guests from Neuch√¢tel were the clear favorites, because the Bern club had lost to them one month before 1‚Äì4. This caused Neuch√¢tel to make the error of underestimating the Young Boys. The Neuch√¢tel defense completely broke apart when the YB striker Walter Frey found the net shortly after halftime to post a 1‚Äì0 lead. The game ended with a one-sided 5‚Äì0 result, and YB after only five years of existence had won their first Swiss football championship. After having trained for the early years on the Schwellenm√§tteli, below the Kirchenfeld bridge, YB played from the year 1904 at Spitalacker-Platz. In subsequent seasons the Young Boys did not win the championship but were always in the top three in the regional group. It took six years for YB to achieve further successes. In 1909, the Berners defeated FC Winterthur in Basel in the finals 1‚Äì0. The next year, the Young Boys won the championship finals against FC Aarau 3‚Äì1 and against Servette Geneva 2‚Äì1. Again in 1911, Servette Geneva and FC Z√ºrich could not prevent YB's fourth championship overall and third in a row. It was the first title hat trick in the history of the Swiss Football Association. YB was also in 1910 and the two following years the champion of the \\"Anglo-cup\\", the predecessor of today's Swisscom Cup. At the time, the fans spoke of a time all opponents dreaded, the \\"YB Quarter Hour\\" 15 minutes before the end of the game. The players sustained their efforts throughout the 90 minutes so effectively that the opponents began to run down after about 75 minutes. An example is the 1910 finals between the YB and Aarau, where until the 80th minute the score stood at 1‚Äì1. Similarly, in the game against Servette in the final round in 1911, up through the 72nd minute the game was a 1‚Äì1 draw, but three goals in the last 18 minutes turned the result decisively for YB to clinch the title hat trick. In 1913, the English football instructor Reynold Williams became the first coach of the club. Shortly thereafter, World War I erupted, and Spitalacker-Platz was converted to a potato field. YB arranged to rent facilities at Kirchfeld for 1,400 francs per year. The military also made space available at the barracks for the team's use. Despite these hardships, the club won Swiss league championship again in 1920. After the war, the team again played on the Spitalacker-Platz. However, the ground no longer suited the requirements of the Young Boys, so they searched for alternatives. They found space at the northeastern border of the city at the Wankdorffeld, and construction was initiated. = 1925‚Äì1951: New name and new stadium = In 1925, the association's name was changed from FC Young Boys to Berner Sport Club Young Boys. This year was also the last game on the old Spitalacker-platz. In October, the new Wankdorf Stadium by the architects Scherler & Berger was opened with a tournament. It was attended by the Old Boys from Basel, Servette Geneva, and the Young Boys. The new sports complex included a main grandstand with 1,200 covered seats, a restaurant, changing rooms, a training hall and a training ground. In total, the new stadium held 22,000 spectators, including covered standing room for 5,000. YB now had a large and modern stadium, which intensified the rivalry with FC Bern, because the older association continued to play at the small and outdated Neufeldplatz. The two clubs went so far as to negotiate a contract, facilitated by Central President Schlegel, to prevent discord. In 1929, YB once again progressed to the final round of the Swiss championship. The first game, on a Sunday, pitted Urania Geneva Sport against YB, the second a week later Grasshoppers against Urania GC, and on the third Sunday in the final YB‚ÄìGC. The first game in Geneva ended with a 0‚Äì0 draw, which satisfied the Bernese. When the Grasshoppers beat Geneva in Zurich 3‚Äì0, the chances for YB to win the title decreased tremendously. In the third game, the guests from Z√ºrich needed only a draw to win the championship for the third time in a row. For this final on 30 June, Young Boys deployed replacement goalkeeper Erich Jung in the offensive midfield position due to player shortages. Striker Johan Baumgartner also scored a goal and YB prevented the championship hat trick with a 2‚Äì0 win. On 10 February 1930, the club purchased an additional strip of land from the community, having noted that the stadium was too small, increasing the entire area of the Wankdorf stadium ground to 35,585 square metres. The 1930 Young Boys became the first to celebrate a Swiss Cup championship. The Swiss Cup had been initiated only five years earlier following the discontinuation of the Anglo Cup at the First World War. With 30,000 spectators crowding Wankdorf YB beat FC Aarau 1‚Äì0. In the following 15 years, YB won neither a league title nor a cup championship. During this time, Wankdorf continued to expand. The capacity of the stadium increased by building an extension to 42,000 spectators, costing the association an additional 300,000 francs. Furthermore, another training field was added. Towards the end of the 1930s, the world economic crisis started and Swiss football felt the effects. The attendance figures fell steadily, and the Sportplatz Spitalacker could no longer meet its financial obligations. After the outbreak of World War II, the club considered selling the stadium. However, through a debt-reduction and the help of the city of Bern in 1943, the finances of the club were rehabilitated. At that point, the stadium group changed its name to \\"Verein Fussball-Stadion Wankdorf\\". During World War II, the Bernese succeeded but could not claim a title. Only in 1945, at the end of the war, came the next success: YB won the second Cup against FC St. Gallen with a 2‚Äì0 victory at Espenmoos. Two seasons later, the Bernese were relegated to the National League B. It would be three seasons until they returned to the highest league where they would then remain for over 50 years. = 1951‚Äì1964: The golden years under Coach Albert Sing = In 1951, Norbert Eric Jones was replaced after only one year as the manager by the previously unknown Albert Sing. At that time, no one anticipated the successful years YB would experience under the German coach. Sing acted initially as a player-coach before he decided to become a trainer only. During his tenure YB experienced its most successful period. The team was reinforced by high-level transfers such as Eugene \\"Geni\\" Meier. Considerable success during this period was also attributed to the goalkeeper Walter Eich, who was one of the best in the history of the Young Boys. Later, the team consisted of top players like Heinz Schneite and Ernst Wechselberger. For the 1954 FIFA World Cup, the capacity of the Wankdorf stadium was increased from around 30,000 to more than 60,000 seats. In the spring of 1953, Young Boys again advanced to the Cup. YB met Grasshoppers Z√ºrich in the final pairing, and the clubs drew 1‚Äì1. Five weeks later, the teams met in a replay, which went to the Bernese 3‚Äì1. In the summer of that year, YB was invited to tour North America. The team played there against some American teams, Liverpool (1‚Äì1), and the Republic of Ireland national team (a 4‚Äì1 win for YB). YB produced impressive results overseas for Swiss football and was enthusiastically received by thousands upon its return to Bern. From 1957 and 1960, YB were Swiss champions four times in a row. During this time, YB became one of the more successful teams in European football and was superior to all Swiss opponents. 1958 brought yet another Cup when YB defeated Grasshoppers in a final replay, 4‚Äì1. Young Boys also achieved success in European competition. At its first appearance in the European Cup, it were politically disadvantaged, however: the Bernese drew the Vasas Budapest, the Hungarian club of the Interior Ministry. Some Swiss politicians demanded that no Swiss sports club should have contacts with the Hungarian football club, especially in Bern, the capital. Servette FC made its Charmilles Stadium available for one game, and 20,000 spectators supported YB in Geneva during a 1‚Äì1 draw against the Hungarians. In the return match, however, Young Boys fell 1‚Äì2. The following year, Young Boys' opponents in the European Cup were once again from Hungary, this time MTK Budapest. YB won the leg in the Nep Stadium 2‚Äì1. 26 November 1958 saw the European premiere in Wankdorf; 28,000 spectators celebrated the Young Boys' 4‚Äì1 victory. In the second round, YB met the East German champions SC Wismut Chemnitz and the Wankdorf was filled with 32,000 spectators. The teams drew 2‚Äì2 after a 2‚Äì0 lead for the Young Boys. A week later, the teams met in the GDR. The game ended 0‚Äì0, which at that time required a deciding game. This took place on 1 April 1959 in the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium before 35,000 spectators, and YB won 2‚Äì1. Thus, Young Boys qualified for the European Cup semi-finals. Their opponents in the semi-finals were Stade de Reims. The game of games in the history of the yellow-and-black took place on 15 April 1959, a rainy Wednesday. Sixty-thousand spectators packed into Wankdorf, but the crowd may have exceeded the official count. After an impressive performance, YB won 1‚Äì0 on a Geni Meier goal in the 13th minute. The game was a legend in Bern. Stade de Reims received the Bernese in the return match at the Parc des Princes, Paris, where the Frenchmen won 3‚Äì0 to reach the final. No other Swiss team besides FC Z√ºrich has since found as much success in an international competition as Young Boys did in this season. In 1960, YB played internationally once again, meeting Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round, where Frankfurt won 4‚Äì1 before 36,000 spectators. In the return match at Frankfurt's Waldstadion, YB managed a 1‚Äì1 draw. In 1961, the team first travelled to Ireland to meet Limerick, where YB won with an impressive 5‚Äì0 showing, then again 4‚Äì2 in front of 22,000 spectators at Wankdorf in the return leg. In the second round, YB met Hamburger SV (and its star striker Uwe Seeler) in what was the first European Cup game in that team's history. Forty- five thousand spectators were at the game in the Wankdorf, where Hamburg stunned YB with a 5‚Äì0 victory. In Hamburg, the Bernese improved upon their previous performance, earning a 3‚Äì3 draw before 40,000 spectators in the Volksparkstadion. It would be the last appearance in Europe for YB for a long time. After four league titles, a European Cup run and many successes, Young Boys traveled 31 days through the Far East, in five weeks having visited ten countries and played several friendly matches against Asian teams. Albert Sing left BSC Young Boys in 1964 and is still the most successful coach in the history of the club. = 1964‚Äì1984: Descent to a normal club = The successor to Albert Sing had large shoes to fill; average performance was no longer acceptable to the discriminating Bernese supporters. Heinz Bigler and Hans Gr√ºtter took over the training until Hans Merkle ultimately succeeded Sing. Merkle had the misfortune to be measured against the championships of his predecessor. Although Geni Meier, Ernst Wechselberger and other players from the championship years continued to play, it mattered little. Merkle was a hard coach of the German school, however, and was able to keep YB in the top half of the table, with finishes of second, fifth, and seventh. The mixture of old and young players did not provide the results the Bernese sought, however. Otto Messerli, then a junior in the first team squad who in later years would be captain of the Young Boys, described the situation: \\"There were many good ideas, but FC Basel and FC Z√ºrich remained unattainable for us.\\" This was also no different for the Merkle successors Skiba, Schneiter und Eich, Br√ºlls, Peters and Linder: The Young Boys reached big games on occasion (such as the Cup final against Basel that brought 52,000 spectators to the Wankdorf), but over the long term their performance was unspectacular. Still, some YB players rose to national recognition. The Dutchman Bert Theunissen replaced Meier and Wechselberger in 1964 as \\"gunner\\" and he became Swiss scoring champion before he left YB. A good replacement for him was found, however: the Bernese bought Dieter Brenninger from Bayern Munich. Another new transfer, Walter \\"Wale\\" Mueller, played between 1967 and 1972 for YB, and was a dreaded striker for opposing defenders. In the late 1960s and '70s, the Bernese met with little success. As YB were runners-up in the 1974‚Äì75 season, they finally returned to European competition. In the first round of the UEFA Cup, the club faced Hamburger SV once again. In the first leg before 17,000 spectators in the Wankdorf, the two teams played to a 0‚Äì0 draw. HSV won at home in its Volksparkstadion (4‚Äì2), and Young Boys were bounced from the competition early. The Young Boys' side for these games included Jakob Brechb√ºhl and Karl Odermatt among others. It took until 1977 before YB would again win a title. Under coach Kurt Linder, the Cup was brought to Bern for the fifth time. Thanks to this title, YB qualified for the preliminary round of the European Cup Winners' Cup. The Bernese faced a daunting challenge in the form of the Rangers of Glasgow. At Ibrox Park, YB played strongly, only losing 0‚Äì1. The return game in front of 17,000 spectators at Wankdorf ended 2‚Äì2, and Rangers advanced. The Young Boys again underwent a change of coaches when Ren√© H√ºssy replaced Linder. 1979 again saw YB (as losing cup finalists) in the European Cup Winners' Cup. On 19 September 1979, only 6,700 spectators came to Wankdorf to see the game against Steaua Bucure»ôti, which ended 2‚Äì2. Before this game, YB had lost three consecutive championship games, which may have contributed to the lack of fans. The goals were scored by Stoica, Zwygart, IordƒÉnescu and Sch√∂nenberger. Two weeks later, Young Boys lost in Bucharest, 0‚Äì6. = 1984‚Äì1991: The Mandziara Era = Turbulent times continued in the Wankdorf. After many coaching changes, in 1984 Alexander Mandziara was hired as manager. The quiet Pole with a German passport played offensive football and was known for hard training sessions. In his first years, Young Boys reached only ninth place. In the next season, 1985‚Äì86, not all went for YB but the team still managed to finish the preliminary round in fifth. During the winter break, the Swede Robert Prytz joined the YB midfield as a playmaker alongside Georges Bregy, and YB achieved an incomparable return round. The point advantage of the leaders Neuch√¢tel Xamax slowly melted round by round. On 24 May 1986, the showdown came in Neuch√¢tel Maladi√®re before a crowd of 21,500 including visiting YB spectators. Young Boys came away with a 4‚Äì1 result. Lars Lunde, Danish scoring champion, and Dario Zuffi each connected twice and YB after 26 years finished in championship position. In the first round of the European championship, the Bernese drew Real Madrid, whose ranks included top stars Hugo S√°nchez and Emilio Butrague√±o. Thirty-two thousand spectators descended on Wankdorf, despite torrential rain, for the match on 17 September 1986. Urs Bamert headed in a goal to provide the 1‚Äì0 margin of victory against the guests from Spain. For the return leg, 75,000 spectators occupied the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium in Madrid. Until the 75th minute, the advantage stood at only 1‚Äì0 for the home side. But the 2‚Äì0 by Jorge Valdano broke the defense of the Young Boys, and Real Madrid went on to win 5‚Äì0. In 1987, YB won the Cup for the sixth time. In the finals, it defeated Servette FC 4‚Äì2 in a replay. In the first round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Young Boys traveled to Dunajsk√° Streda, Czechoslovakia, where the Slovak team won 2‚Äì1. Before 8,100 spectators, YB prevailed in Bern 3‚Äì1 and qualified for the second round. In the round of 16, the Bernese visited FC Den Haag, where it lost 1‚Äì2. In the return match in Bern, only 6,400 spectators braved the icy chill of the Wankdorf. A 1‚Äì0 YB victory was enough to progress into the quarter-finals. The next opponent was again from the Netherlands, this time Ajax of Amsterdam. Temperatures of ‚àí6 on 9 March 1988 caused Wankdorf to be rather sparsely occupied with only 7,686 spectators. Ajax won the game 1‚Äì0. The return leg in Amsterdam before 30,000 spectators saw the Bernese lose again 1‚Äì0 to fall out of the competition. = 1991‚Äì2001: Down and up = A highlight of the 1990s was the Cup finale against FC Sion in 1991. The Wankdorf was packed with 50,000 spectators, with both teams contributing to the atmosphere. At halftime, the Bernese led 2‚Äì0, but Sion shot back in the second half with three goals to win the Cup. In 1993, YB qualified for the UEFA Cup and met Celtic in the first round. Only 7,300 spectators came to the stadium for the home leg, and the game ended 0‚Äì0. Young Boys fell in Celtic Park in Glasgow before 21,500 spectators in extra time, 1‚Äì0, with Andr√© Baumann netting an own goal in the 105th minute. In the mid-1990s, the former football powerhouse increasingly experienced problems. Young Boys developed financial difficulties and in 1997 ‚Äì for the first time since the 1946‚Äì47 season ‚Äì YB was relegated to the National League B (today's Challenge League). New Swedish coaches Roland Andersson and Thomas Sj√∂berg helped the club recover, placing first and earning promotion again, with Robert Schober and Admir Smajic taking over on the bench. The following NLA season began with a surprise victory over the reigning champion Grasshoppers. Many defeats, however, forced the Young Boys back into the relegation play-offs. The economic and sporting emergency ended in the dismissal of coach Claude Ryf. The BSC Young Boys organization stood very close to bankruptcy and few thought it still possible to salvage YB. A Lucerne investment company saved the club from ruin, although by 1999 the debt was over 1.7 million Swiss francs (~‚Ç¨1.08 million). Almost the entire squad left the capital and YB competed with the shell of a team the next season. The result was disastrous: third-last place after the 1999 qualification/descent round. The possibility of further relegation to the 1st League (third tier) threatened. Marco Sch√§llibaum took over as manager and brought in reinforcements, which had a positive impact and enabled the club to stay up. On 17 December 1999, the BSC Young Boys AG was established with capital of CHF 500,000 (~‚Ç¨320,000). The AG took over the operations of the first time and increased the share capital. The remaining operation remains under the previous organization. The next championship was contested with a more powerful team with new players such as Harutyun Vardanyan and G√ºrkan Sermeter. YB won victory after victory in the autumn and inspired the loyal fans with attractive offensive football. The team earned the top place in the table and participation in the promotion playoffs, ultimately returning to the top division. New enthusiasm developed in Bern, and the attendance figures rose significantly. The first game of the 2001‚Äì02 season was the final game in old Wankdorf stadium. YB drew FC Lugano 1‚Äì1 before 22,200 spectators, and the last goal for the Bernese in the old Wankdorf was tallied by Reto Burri. = 2001‚Äì2005: In the Neufeldstadion = Young Boys played at the Neufeldstadion at the north end of town until the new, multi-functional Stade de Suisse Wankdorf Bern was opened in 2005. In the autumn of 2001, with a 1‚Äì3 home defeat against Grasshoppers, a series of 25 home games without defeat came to an end. However, with a 1‚Äì0 victory in the last game against FC St. Gallen on 9 December 2001, Young Boys qualified for the final round for the first time in seven years. The start of the final round was very promising. YB played exciting football and contended for a place in an international competition but ultimately finished in seventh position. The team also reached the semi- finals of the Swiss Cup before falling in a penalty shootout to FC Basel. In 2002, YB finished the qualifying round in seventh and the final round in fourth place, earning the Young Boys an entry in an international competition (the UEFA Cup) for the first time in ten years. This season also saw St√©phane Chapuisat move to the club. Chapuisat is considered one of the best strikers in Swiss history. In 2003, the league was completely reformed, including the names and sizes of the two highest leagues. For the 2003‚Äì04 season, Hans-Peter Zaugg was named as the new head coach. The played in the first \\"Super League\\", taking second place. As a result, the team qualified for the 2004‚Äì05 Champions League, where they fell to Red Star Belgrade 5‚Äì2 on aggregate. The domestic season 2004‚Äì05 found them finishing in fourth place. = 2005‚Äìpresent: In the new Wankdorf Stadium = In the summer of 2005, YB was able to begin using the newly built Wankdorfstadion, the Stade de Suisse, after several years of construction. Only a few months later Gernot Rohr signed as a coach. Although team maintained a defensive football strategy, the club succeeded with him at its head, advancing to the Cup final, but losing on a penalty shoot-out to Sion. The first season at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf, YB finished in third place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. The Bernese defeated Mika of Armenia 4‚Äì1 on aggregate in the first qualifying round to set up a very attractive matchup with French giants Marseille, but narrowly lost the tie on away goals with draws 3‚Äì3 at home and 0‚Äì0 away. Coach Gernot Rohr was succeeded by Martin Andermatt. The debut of Andermatt was promising, as YB defeated their canton rivals Thun 5‚Äì1 to open 2006‚Äì07 league play. The team finished the season in fourth place, once again returning to the UEFA Cup. On 14 April 2007, the club president Peter Mast announced that he would resign his position at the end of the season, although he immediately joined the board of directors. His post as president was assumed by Thomas Grimm on 17 April 2007. Incidentally, in this season, with an average of 15,517 spectators in the championship, the club celebrated its highest attendance average in club history. Young Boys finished runners-up in the 2009‚Äì10 season, finishing three points behind champions Basel despite losing only one match at home all season. It entered Champions League qualification and defeated Fenerbah√ße to set up a meeting with Tottenham Hotspur in the play-off round. YB went out to a 3‚Äì0 lead in the opening leg at Stade de Suisse on Tuesday 17 August, but had to hold on for a 3‚Äì2 win, then, fell 4‚Äì0 at White Hart Lane eight nights later and went out of the competition. Following its defeat, Young Boys was dropped to the Europa League group stage. The Bernese club qualified for the knockout stage of the tournament as runners-up of its group, behind group leaders VfB Stuttgart and at the expense of Getafe and Odense. In the Round of 32, the club faced Zenit Saint Petersburg, defeating its Russian opponents at home in the first leg (2‚Äì1), but suffering elimination after the second leg, losing 3‚Äì1 in their visit at Saint Petersburg. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, the club finished third in the league, which qualified YB to the UEFA Europa League for the next season. The following season was similar for the Yellow-Blacks, finishing third once again in the league. In the same season, YB failed to reach the Europa League group stage after being eliminated by Braga 2‚Äì2 on aggregate on the away goals rule (0‚Äì0 in Braga; 2‚Äì2 in Bern). On 28 April 2018, following a 2‚Äì1 home win over Luzern, Young Boys were confirmed as 2017‚Äì18 Swiss Super League champions, their first league title in 32 years. On 28 August 2018, Young Boys qualified to UEFA Champions League Group stage for the first time in their history, after defeating Dinamo Zagreb with a 3‚Äì2 aggregate score in play-off round. In April 2019, YB secured the 13th title without playing. After a 0-0 between Basel and GC, YB was determined as the champion.  Stadium  BSC Young Boys supporters Since 2005, Young Boys plays its home matches at the new Wankdorf Stadium (2005 - 2020 Stade de Suisse Wankdorf). The stadium seats 31,120 spectators and is the second largest football stadium in Switzerland, after St. Jakob-Park. Since 1925, Young Boys had played in the historic Wankdorf Stadium located on the same spot. Security concerns lead to the need of a modern all-seater stadium in the new millennium. As various factors like building regulations or labour law make it impossible to sustainably finance a modern football stadium in Switzerland, the reconstructed Wankdorf Stadium has been built on top of a new shopping mall called Wankdorf Center together with schools, homes, a fitness center, several gyms, some restaurants and a parking facility with over 700 places by which the new stadium is cross-financed. All modern Swiss football stadiums have been built together with a shopping mall and other cross-financing facilities for that same reason. The total construction cost of the project was 350 million francs which was at the time more than any other building in Switzerland. The building and the club BSC Young Boys are both owned by businessman Hans-Ueli Rihs who together with his late brother Andy has financed Young Boys since taking ownership at the beginning of the millennium. Andy died on April 18, 2018, just 10 days before YB won the championship. https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/andy-rihs-nach- laengerer-krankheit-gestorben-ld.1378796?reduced=true The name arises from the fact that the Wankdorf ought to act as a National Stadium. As one of the few stadiums with artificial turf, however, national team matches are rarely held there. The artificial pitch allows Young Boys to hold daily training sessions in the same place as Young Boys doesn't have a training center. For UEFA Euro 2008, a natural grass field was laid as three group stage matches took place. The stadium is also the largest stadium-integrated solar power plant in the world. On the roof of the Stade de Suisse are enough solar cells to generate 700,000 kWh. This requires approximately 300,000 square meters of panels i.e. 30 hectares. The electricity powers the stadium and some houses around the Wankdorf area. The stadium is near a highway interchange and only a few minutes' drive from the main railway station in Bern and only a few minutes' walk from the Wankdorf station. There is a bus and tram stop located in front of the stadium.

Bend on Calder Water at Langlands/Hurlawcrook It begins as the Calder Water at its source at Ardochrig, and is joined by the Cleughearn, Lea and Drumloch Burns around Langlands Moss which drain from the Eldrig Hills. This river has also been titled the 'West' or 'South Calder Water', although the latter title is shared by another river in Motherwell. Upon being joined by the Rotten Burn to the south-east of East Kilbride, the river becomes the Rotten Calder Water. 'Water' is a term used in Scotland to denote a small river. The Calder flowing through Calderglen Country Park The Rotten Calder runs through a romantic scenic gorge titled Calderglen, where it flows through East Kilbride Parish. This area of the gorge is under the jurisdiction of Calderglen Country Park, run by South Lanarkshire Council. Over 160 nature trails border the river on both banks, in addition to the forest which occupies the slopes, and ferns, mosses and liverworts on the rocky precipices. Otter, roe deer and European green woodpecker can be seen in the southern reaches of the park. Buzzards can be seen hunting over open areas by the river and the grey heron, grey wagtail and dipper are common sights too. The river flows by the site of the former Calderwood Castle (demolished 1947-1951). Stone bridge over Rotten Calder at Newhousemill Road on the edge of East Kilbride The gorge of the Rotten Calder Water was celebrated in books and poems for its romantic grandeur and lush ivy-tied crags. Many traces of 18th- and 19th-century landscape additions can be traced in the park, as well as old mines, quarries, and religious sites. After passing under the General's Bridge at Stoneymeadow, the Water flows by Crossbasket Castle (House) in an easterly direction, and on through the former estates of Greenhall and Milheugh where the valley is seen to give way to wide flood plains. The Calder flowing under another stone bridge near High Blantyre After Milheugh the river again regains its steep gorge and flows through scenery before flowing into the River Clyde near Bothwell Castle. There are many waterfalls on the river, these are Millwell Linn, Flatt Linn (Crutherland Linn), Torrance Linn (Fairy Linn or Walk Fort Linn), Black Linn, Trough Linn, Calderwood Linn (Castle Falls), Crossbasket Linn, Horseshoe Falls, Old Horseshoe Linn, Small Falls, and Milheugh Falls.

Gameplay The Lost Treasures of Infocom compiles 20 interactive fiction titles, with which the player interacts via text parser. The compilation includes Zork I, II and III, along with the Zork-connected games Beyond Zork, Zork Zero, Enchanter, Sorcerer and Spellbreaker. The other titles included are Deadline, The Witness, Suspect, The Lurking Horror, Ballyhoo, Infidel, Moonmist, Starcross, Suspended, Planetfall, Stationfall and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The package merely contained photocopies or pictures of these items, such as the sunglasses from Hitchhiker's Guide and the Stellar Patrol ID card from Planetfall. Development Discussing the announcement of The Lost Treasures of Infocom, Scorpia of Computer Gaming World noted that Activision was \\"rising like a phoenix ... from the bankrupt ashes of Mediagenic\\" with the release. After the company's restructuring during bankruptcy, it began to lean on its back catalog of licenses, including Zork. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick later said that \\"Zork on a brick would sell 100,000 copies\\". Infocom had been closed by Activision in 1989; the publisher held the copyright to nearly all the past Infocom titles. An additional bonus was the updated version of Hitchhiker's Guide. The game was repackaged using a later version of the Z-machine than the original, and now featured a built-in hint system. Reception The Lost Treasures of Infocom was a commercial hit. Peter Doctorow of Activision reported in 1992 that The Lost Treasures of Infocom was \\"selling extremely well\\". Jeremy Reimer of Ars Technica wrote, \\"Retailing for $99, it sold over 100,000 copies and was almost pure profit.

Matvei Gedenschtrom attended University of Tartu. He did not finish his studies and left his alma mater in favor of work at Tallinn customs. Soon, however, he was arrested in connection with a smuggling affair, tried, and then banished to Siberia. In 1808, Gedenschtrom arrived in Irkutsk and received his first duty assignment, namely, the exploration of the coastline of the Arctic Ocean. Lacking necessary scientific background, Matvei Gedenschtrom had to study a lot in order to be able to reckon a latitude and longitude of a given location and use scientific equipment in general. Gedenschtrom led the cartographic expedition to explore the New Siberian Islands (together with Yakov Sannikov and land surveyors Pyotr Pshenitsyn and I.Kozhevin). The theory about the existence of Sannikov Land somewhere northwest of the Kotelny Island originated during this very expedition. Gedenschtrom established the presence of the Siberian polynya ‚Äì patches of open water in sea ice at the edge of the drifting ice and continental fast ice. In 1809, Gedenschtrom visited the eastern shores of an island, discovered by merchants Semyon and Lev Syrovatsky three years earlier, and named it New Siberia (this name would be officially endorsed in 1810). Gedenschtrom charted the coastline between the mouths of the rivers Yana and Kolyma. He also made many trips across Yakutia and areas east of the Lake Baikal. In 1813, Matvei Gedenschtrom was employed by the secretariat of Irkutsk governor. Later on, he was appointed head of district police (–∏—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏–∫) in Verkhne-Udinsk, which did not distract him from scientific research and compiling his mineralogical and botanic collection. Matvei Gedenschtrom was a smart, talented, educated, and kind man, who often helped local peasants with advice and money. However, he was also known to have been an immoral person and a squanderer. He was one of the closest associates of Nikolai Treskin (then-governor of Irkutsk) and made a sizeable fortune on bread purchases assigned to him by the governor‚Äôs office. In 1819, Mikhail Speransky (governor general of Siberia) paid a visit to Irkutsk as part of his Siberian tour and exposed many instances of official misconduct by local authorities. On 20 February 1820, Matvei Gedenschtrom was removed from his post for his autocratic style of management, embezzlement, extortion, and fraud. Speransky‚Äôs report on his findings was examined by a special committee, established on 28 July 1821. The committee divided all of the offenders into ten categories. Gedenschtrom found himself in the third category, which meant he could never again be admitted to hold any public posts and had to be banished to an inner guberniya (European Russia). However, it was soon decided not to send him away from Siberia and settle him in Tobolsk. Willing to take advantage of Matvei Gedenshtrom‚Äôs skills and experience, the administration of Western Siberia managed to obtain permission for him to join the public service. In 1827, Gedenshtrom was allowed to return to European Russia and then employed by the Medical Service Corps (–ú–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –¥–µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç) as a section chief. In the 1830s, Matvei Gedenshtrom was appointed a postmaster in Tomsk. Upon his retirement, he moved to a village of Kaidukovaya near Tomsk and spent the rest of his days drinking. Matvei Gedenshtrom died in extreme poverty on 20 September 1845, at the age of 65. He was interred in Tomsk three days later. Works Skehes on Siberia (–û—Ç—Ä—ã–≤–∫–∏ –æ –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏; 1830).

The Toolbox consists of a number of \\"managers,\\" software components such as QuickDraw, responsible for drawing onscreen graphics, and the Menu Manager, which maintain data structures describing the menu bar. As the original Macintosh was designed without virtual memory or memory protection, it was important to classify code according to when it should be loaded into memory or kept on disk, and how it should be accessed. The Toolbox consists of subroutines essential enough to be permanently kept in memory and accessible by a two-byte machine instruction; however it excludes core \\"kernel\\" functionality such as memory management and the file system. Note that the Toolbox does not draw the menu onscreen: menus were designed to have a customizable appearance, so the drawing code was stored in a resource, which could be on a disk.  Advent and implementation  = On 68k systems = The original Motorola 68000 family implementation of the Macintosh operating system executes system calls using that processor's illegal opcode exception handling mechanism. Motorola specified that instructions beginning with 1111 and 1010 would never be used in future 68000 family processors, thus freeing them for use as such by an operating system. Further, they each had their own dedicated interrupt vector, separate from the generic illegal opcode handler. As 1111 was reserved for use by co-processors such as the 68881 FPU, Apple chose 1010 (hexadecimal A) as the prefix for operating system calls. Handling illegal instructions is known as trapping, so these special instructions were called A-traps. Alt URL When the processor encounters such an instruction, it transfers control to the operating system, which looks up the appropriate task and performs it. There were two advantages to this mechanism: * It results in compact programs. Only two bytes are taken by every operating system access, in contrast to four or six when using regular jump instructions. * The table used to look up the appropriate function is stored in RAM. Then, even if the underlying code was stored in ROM, it could still be overridden (patched) by replacing the ROM memory address with a RAM address. The system was further optimized by allotting some bits of the A-trap instruction to store parameters to the most common functions. For example, memory allocation is a very common task, so it should be expressed in as few bytes of code as possible. Sometimes the programmer wants to clear the memory block to zeros, so either the allocation function should take a boolean parameter, or there should be two allocation functions. To pass a parameter would require an additional two-byte instruction, which would be inefficient. Having two functions would require at least an extra four bytes of RAM used for the address in the function look-up table. The most efficient solution is to map multiple A-traps to the same subroutine, which then uses the A-trap as a parameter. This is true of the most commonly used subroutines. However, the Toolbox was composed of the less commonly used subroutines. The Toolbox was defined as the set of subroutines which took no parameters within the A-trap, and were indexed from a 1024-entry, 4-kilobyte dispatch table. Alt URL (Machines shipped with less than one megabyte of RAM use a single table of 512 entries, which corresponds to the 256-entry OS dispatch table of later ROM revisions.) = On PowerPC systems = In 1994, Apple released Macintoshes using the PowerPC architecture, which lacked hardware support for the A-trap mechanism available on 68k systems. Because of their use in applying software patches, however, the dispatch tables were retained. The API library code underlying any Toolbox routine then does nothing except reference the dispatch table. The dispatch table linked only to emulated 68000 family code. Toolbox functions implemented in native PowerPC code have to first disable the emulator using the Mixed Mode Manager. For the sake of uniformity and extensibility, new function entries even continued to be added to the Toolbox after the PowerPC transition. An alternative mechanism did exist, however, in the Code Fragment Manager, which was used to load and dynamically link native PowerPC programs. The PowerPC system call facility, analogous to the A-trap mechanism, was used to interface with the Mac OS nanokernel, which offered few services directly useful to applications.  Functionality  = Programming interfaces = The Toolbox is composed of commonly used functions, but not the most commonly used functions. As a result, it grew into a hodgepodge of different API libraries. The Toolbox encompasses most of the basic functionality which distinguished the Classic Mac OS. Apple's references ‚ÄúInside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials‚Äù and ‚ÄúInside Macintosh: More Macintosh Toolbox‚Äù, similarly vague in scope, also document most of the Toolbox. = Use in booting = Because much of the Toolbox is implemented in ROM, alongside the computer's firmware, it was convenient to use as a bootloader environment. In conjunction with resources stored on the ROM chip, the Toolbox can turn the screen gray, show a dialog box with the signature \\"Welcome to Macintosh\\" greeting, and display the mouse cursor. By using Toolbox to help boot the machine, a rudimentary Mac-like environment can be initialized before ever loading the System suitcase from disk (in fact before ROMs on NuBus cards were executed), which is when the decision to use 24-bit or 32-bit addressing has to be made. (System 7's support for 32-bit addressing requires 32-bit clean ROMs, as older Mac ROMs do not have support for this). The need for diagnostics as in the BIOS resident for IBM PC compatibles' boards is not necessary since the Macintosh has most of its diagnostics in POST and automatically reports errors via the \\"Sad Mac\\" codes. The similarity between the boot-up environment and the actual operating system should not be confused with being identical, however. Although the \\"Classic Mac OS\\" boot process is convoluted and largely undocumented, it is not more limited than an IBM PC compatible BIOS. Like a PC's master boot record, a ROM-based Mac reads and executes code from the first blocks (\\"boot blocks\\") of the disk partition selected as the boot device. The boot blocks then verify that a suitable rudimentary environment exists, and use it to load the System suitcase. A different operating system with a different file system can boot by simply using its own code in the boot blocks. Alt URL This system was not used for PowerPC Linux, however, because Open Firmware in New World ROM machines requires a bootloader within an HFS filesystem‚Äîa reason having nothing to do with the Toolbox or \\"old-fashioned\\" Macs in general. More narrowly, the Startup Disk control panel in the Classic Mac OS and macOS only allows the user to select a mounted filesystem with very particular constraints.  Legacy  In Mac OS X, the Toolbox is not used at all, though the Classic Environment loads the Toolbox ROM file into its virtual machine. Much of the Toolbox was restructured and implemented as part of Apple's Carbon programming API, allowing programmers familiar with the Toolbox to port their program code more easily to Mac OS X.

This is similar to a quine, except that a quine's source code is exactly equivalent to its own output. Metamorphic code also usually outputs machine code and not its own source code. This is used by computer viruses to avoid the pattern recognition of anti-virus software. Metamorphic viruses often translate their own binary code into a temporary representation, editing the temporary representation of themselves and then translate the edited form back to machine code again. This procedure is done with the virus itself, and thus also the metamorphic engine itself undergoes changes, which means that no part of the virus stays the same. This differs from polymorphic code, where the polymorphic engine can not rewrite its own code. Metamorphic code is used by some viruses when they are about to infect new files, and the result is that the next generation will never look like current generation. The mutated code will do exactly the same thing (under the interpretation used), but the child's binary representation will typically be completely different from the parent's. Mutation can be achieved using techniques like inserting NOP instructions (brute force), changing what registers to use, changing flow control with jumps, changing machine instructions to equivalent ones or reordering independent instructions. Metamorphism does not protect a virus against heuristic analysis. Metamorphic code can also mean that a virus is capable of infecting executables from two or more different operating systems (such as Windows and GNU/Linux) or even different computer architectures. Often, the virus does this by carrying several viruses within itself. The beginning of the virus is then coded so that it translates to correct machine-code for all of the platforms that it is supposed to execute in. This is used primarily in remote exploit injection code where the target platform is unknown.

It was an afterburning turbojet with a unique compressor bleed to the afterburner which gave increased thrust at high speeds. Because of the wide speed range of the aircraft the engine needed two modes of operation to take it from stationary on the ground to at altitude. It was a conventional afterburning turbojet for take-off and acceleration to Mach 2 and then used permanent compressor bleed to the afterburner above Mach 2. The way the engine worked at cruise led it to be described as \\"acting like a turboramjet\\". It has also been described as a turboramjet based on incorrect statements describing the turbomachinery as being completely bypassed. The engine performance which met the mission requirements for the CIA and USAF over many years was later enhanced slightly for NASA experimental work (carrying external payloads on the top of the aircraft) which required more thrust to deal with higher aircraft drag. Development =Origins= The J58, company designation JT11, had its origins in the larger JT9 (J91) engine. It was a 3/4 scale JT9 with a mass flow of , down from . The JT11 was initially proposed to the US Navy with the Navy designation J58. It was also proposed for various Navy and Air Force aircraft, e.g. Convair F-106, North American F-108, Convair B-58C, Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III, and North American A3J Vigilante. None of these applications were followed up. The J58 was initially developed for the US Navy to power the planned version of the Martin P6M jet flying boat. The P6M started out using Allison J71-A-4 engines and then switched to the Pratt & Whitney J75 as the J58 was not ready due to development problems. Upon cancellation of this aircraft, it was selected for the Convair Kingfish and for the Lockheed A-12, YF-12A and SR-71. Other sources link its origin to the USAF's requirement for a powerplant for the WS-110A, the future XB-70 Valkyrie. =Re-design for Mach 3.2= J58 on full afterburner, showing shock diamonds Analytical predictions for the performance of the original J58 showed that at Mach 2.5 the \\"exhaust pressure was equal to the inlet pressure, the compressor was deep in surge, and there was no cool air to the afterburner liner that would therefore melt\\". The first problem was caused by too-high of a compressor delivery temperature which did not allow enough energy to be added in the engine combustor to provide any thrust from the gas generator. All the thrust-producing pressure in the jet-pipe came from ram, as with a ramjet, and none from the gas generator. Fuel for thrust could only be added in the afterburner which became the only source of engine thrust. The speed at which the gas generator produced no thrust would be raised from about Mach 2.5 to about Mach 3 by the patented design changes described below. Beyond that speed the gas generator would become a drag item with, at Mach 3.2, a pressure ratio of 0.9. Even minimum afterburner would not balance the drag. The effect was described qualitatively by Lockheed inlet designer David Campbell \\"..with minimum afterburner the engine would be dragging on the engine mounts at high Mach numbers.\\" The second was caused by the compressor trying to operate at too-low a corrected speed in an area of its compressor map known as \\"off- design\\". The third was caused by the afterburner duct being cooled with too- hot turbine exhaust gas. U.S. patent 3,344,606 describes the changes to the engine that extended the engine's capability to Mach 3.2. They included diverting 20% of the compressor entry air after the 4th compressor stage directly to the afterburner through six external tubes. This allowed the compressor to work properly with adequate surge margin and increased airflow into the compressor. Some of the increased flow left the compressor after the 4th stage as bypass to the afterburner and some left the last compressor stage through the previously-choked area. The increased airflow gave more thrust. The inlet guide vanes were modified with trailing edge flaps to reduce blade flutter and prevent blade fatigue failures. The afterburner was cooled with the bleed air which was cooler than the turbine exhaust gas. Not all the oxygen in the bleed air was available for combustion as most of the bleed air was directed into the cooling shroud before entering the afterburner cavity for reheating. The improved afterburner cooling allowed a higher flame temperature which gave more thrust. The engine was completely redesigned, except for the compressor and turbine aerodynamic definitions, so that it would be reliable running for prolonged periods at unprecedented temperatures, not only inside the engine but also surrounding the casings where the controls, accessories, electrical wiring and fuel and oil tubes were located. =Starting= Two starting methods used during the life of the A-12, YF-12 and SR-71 aircraft were: an AG330 starter cart, with two Buick Wildcat V8 internal combustion engines driving a common output shaft, and compressed-air using a small starter adapter. The air-start method superseded the cumbersome \\"Buicks\\" when compressed air supplies became available. =Fuel= Any aircraft flying at three times the speed of sound is in a severe thermal environment, both from frictional heating and stagnation ram rise. The fuel was the only heat sink available to the aircraft and after absorbing keeping everything cool enough, from the crew to the exhaust nozzle area indicator, it was supplied to the fuel nozzles at . To cope with these very high temperatures a new jet fuel, JP-7 with a low vapour pressure had to be developed. A chemical method for igniting the fuel, triethylborane (TEB), was developed to match its low volatility. TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air above ‚àí5 ¬∞C. The engine and afterburner were lit with TEB and the afterburner also had a catalytic igniter which glowed in the hot turbine exhaust. Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized sealed tank with 600 cm3 (20.7 ounces) of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number was one of the limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to idle position, fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. 50 cm3 (1.7 ounce) shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the injector nozzle, hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner. One source of heat had to be brought under control before it entered the fuel heat-sink system. Environmental Control System (ECS) air leaving the engine compressor at was so hot that ram air at had to be used first. Fuel flowing from the tanks to the engines was used to cool the air conditioning systems, aircraft hydraulic fluid, engine oil, accessory drive system oil, the TEB tank and afterburner nozzle actuator control lines. =Materials= The development of the J58 brought with it some of the most challenging metallurgical development problems experienced by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft up to that time with components operating at unprecedented levels of temperature, stress and durability. New manufacturing techniques as well as new alloys improved the mechanical properties and surface coatings had to be developed to protect component surfaces. Premature cracking of turbine vanes and blades made from what was then conventionally-cast (i.e. equiaxed) Mar-M200, the strongest of the cast nickel-base alloys, was avoided with the development of directionally solidified parts cast in the same material. Directionally solidified Mar-M200 became the strongest cast turbine material in existence at that time and was introduced in production engines. Single crystal turbine blades cast in Mar-M200, giving further improvements in high temperature properties would also be developed through testing in J58 engines. Waspaloy was the most widely used alloy in the engine, from critical high-energy rotating compressor discs to components made from sheet. Although used for turbine discs in other engines it did not have the required properties for J58 turbine discs. Astroloy, the strongest known nickel-base superalloy in the Western world at that time, was used instead. Waspaloy was also used initially for the diffuser case, the part which joins the compressor to the combustor and which contains the highest pressure in the engine. Diffuser case weld cracking led to the introduction of Inconel 718 for this part. The afterburner liner was sprayed with ceramic thermal barrier coating which, together with the cooling air from the compressor, allowed continuous use of the afterburner with flame temperatures up to 3,200 ¬∞F (1760 ‚ÑÉ). =Performance enhancement for NASA= NASA was loaned 2 SR-71 aircraft for research work. One was modified to flight-test a Linear Aerospike rocket engine and was fitted with thrust- enhanced J58 engines. Engine thrust was increased by 5% to offset increased aircraft drag. The increased thrust came from a throttle push, or exhaust gas temperature uptrim, of . The increase was limited by the allowable reduction in life of the second stage turbine blades (the life-limiting component) from 400 to 50 hours. The same thrust enhancement studies used for this work also looked at an additional 5% thrust from additional afterburner fuel made possible with oxidizer injection (nitrous oxide). The nitrous oxide rate would have been limited by thermal choking of the nozzle. =Legacy= J58 experience was used extensively in the JTF17 engine proposal for a Mach 2.7 SST due to significant flight time at Mach 2.7 and above. It was also used for subsequent engines developed by Pratt & Whitney, both commercial and military. The next afterburning engine, the TF-30 as installed in the F-111, used an airframe-mounted secondary nozzle with free-floating flaps similar to that used on the SR-71. J58 emissions were measured as part of the NASA Stratospheric Wake Experiment which looked at the environmental impact of using afterburning jet engines for supersonic transports. An engine was tested in an altitude chamber at a maximum condition of full afterburning at Mach 3.0 and 19.8 km altitude. Design =Contemporary compressor solutions for Mach 3 flight= Alternative solutions to combat the adverse effects of high inlet temperature on the aerodynamic performance of the compressor were rejected by the Pratt & Whitney patentee, Robert Abernethy. One of those solutions was used in a contemporary installation. The GE YJ93/XB-70 used a variable stator compressor to avoid front stage stall and rear stage choking. Another possible solution, pre-compressor cooling, was used on the MiG-25. Water/methanol was injected from a spray mast in front of the compressor to lower the intake temperature for short durations at maximum speed.Air International Magazine, November 1979, p.250 Pre-compressor cooling was also proposed for a Mach 3 reconnaissance Phantomhttp://aviationtrivia.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/the- mach-3-phantom.html \\"Tails Through Time\\" J P Santiago Wednesday, July 18, 2012 \\"The Mach 3 Phantom\\" and the Mach 3+ F-106 RASCAL project. =Propulsion system design= Operation of the air inlet and nozzle showing air flow through the nacelle The propulsion system consisted of the intake, engine, nacelle or secondary airflow and ejector nozzle (propelling nozzle). The propulsive thrust distribution between these components changed with flight speed: at Mach 2.2 inlet 13% ‚Äì engine 73% ‚Äì ejector 14%; at Mach 3.0+ inlet 54% ‚Äì engine 17.6% ‚Äì ejector 28.4%. Intake Schlieren flow visualization at Unstart of axisymmetric inlet at Mach 2 The intake had to supply air to the engine with acceptable pressure loss and distortion. It had to do this at all flight conditions. Nacelle airflow and ejector nozzle The ejector, or secondary, nozzle performed the reverse function of the inlet accelerating the turbine exhaust from about Mach 1.0, as it left the primary nozzle, back up to Mach 3.

It is one of the six most threatened waterfowl in the world, with possibly fewer than 250 birds in the wild and a few kept in captivity in Brazil. The origin of its name is from its long, sharp-edged beak that has a great number of teeth-looking edges. Description This merganser is a dark, slender duck with a shiny dark-green hood with a long crest, which is usually shorter and more worn-looking in females. Upperparts are dark grey while the breast is light grey, getting paler toward the whitish belly, and a white wing patch is particularly noticeable in flight. It has a long thin jagged black bill with red feet and legs. Although females are smaller with a shorter bill and crest, both sexes are alike in color. The slender ducks range in size from 49 centimeters to 56 centimeters as an adult. Young Brazilian mergansers are mainly black with white throat and breast. The Brazilian mergansers are generally silent birds, but may make barking calls in certain situations. Four calls have been recorded. A harsh krack-krack acts as an alarm call emitted in flight. Males make a barking dog-like call, females make a harsh rrr-rrrr and the contact call ia a soft rak-rak-rak. Ducklings give a high pitched ik-ik-ik. Breeding Depending on the availability of suitable nesting and feeding sites, Brazilian merganser pairs occupy permanent territories of eight to seventeen kilometer stretches of rivers. Tree cavities, rock crevices, or disused burrows predominantly made by armadillos are the ideal places for these mergansers to build their nests. It is thought the breeding season is during the austral winter, when rain is minimal and water levels are low, but it may vary geographically. The Brazilian merganser usually lays three to six eggs in June and July, with the chicks hatching during the following July and August. The young are capable of flight by September and/or October. Only the female birds incubate the eggs, but both parents care for the young. This is a very unusual behavior in ducks for both parents to help raise the young birds including direct provision of food to young. Adult Brazilian mergansers are believed to remain on the same territory all year round, but there is not very much information about their movements and dispersal, so information on this is presently speculative in nature. Fish is the Brazilian merganser's main food, and they also eat molluscs, insects and their larvae. The birds, usually in pairs, capture fish by diving in river rapids and backwater. Population The total world population for Brazilian mergansers is believed to be less than 250 birds. Originally, the duck's geographical distribution comprised central-south Brazil and adjacent regions in Paraguay and Argentina. Currently, all confirmed populations are located in Brazil and a more recent population in Argentina and information on most populations is very scarce. The Brazilian merganser population in the Serra da Canastra region is the most significant and best known, with populations occurring hundreds of kilometers away from each other. There are 47 individuals‚Äî28 adults and 19 young‚Äîin the Serra de Canastra region as of 2006. Most mergansers are found in the Serra da Canastra National Park. 70 birds have been seen near the park's headquarters in rio S√£o Francisco. In Jalap√£o region are estimated 13 individuals in Novo river on 2009/2010 (four couples and some solitary adults). In 2002, the species was also found on the Arroyo Uruzu in Misiones, Argentina, the first record in the country for ten years, despite extensive surveys done by local researchers conducted throughout previous years. The bird was last reported seen in 1984 in Paraguay, where very little habitat remains; however some local reports show that a few individuals may still be living in the area. Habitat The slender Brazilian mergansers live in low densities in remote and mountainous regions where it inhabits clean rivers and streams with river rapids and riparian vegetation. Brazilian mergansers are very territorial birds defending large stretches of river and the land surrounding the fast-flowing water. They are recognized as a resident species that does not abandon the watercourses where it established its territory. They do not move or want to move once their habitats have disappeared. The birds need large territories and their habitat is fast dwindling. Threat The Brazilian mergansers are very sensitive to habitat degradation and loss primarily due to human actions. A major threat to the birds' survival is the issue of silting of rivers caused by the expansion of farming activities, mining, watershed degradation and soil erosion, as well as deforestation. Current traditional soil management and use practices in the region from farming may bring about serious damage regarding conservation of natural resources, especially water, on which the Brazilian mergansers and the farmers themselves are dependent. One of the farming practices here is shifting cultivation. It is common in the region to see farmers burning forest areas causing environmental damage to the natural vegetation and soils and the resident species. A new threat to the species includes the installation of hydroelectric plants. Hydropower plants are planned to be built in the same rivers that Brazilian mergansers have been found in Paran√° (rio Tibagi), Goi√°s (rio Paran√£) and Tocantins (rio Novo). The hydropower plants are a major threat to the birds' survival because the plants transform systems such as creeks, rivers and streams into turbid lake systems. The project has government backing in spite of the damage it may cause. Dam-building has also become a major part in the disappearance of these birds. The filling of the Urugua-i reservoir, which took place between 1989 and 1991, had a major impact on Brazilian mergansers in Argentina. The population declined drastically when its fast-flowing rivers were turned into large lakes. After the Urugua-i dam was built, the birds have only been seen on the Uruzu stream, a tributary of the Urugua-i. The dams flood suitable habitat, especially in Brazil and Paraguay, where the Brazilian mergansers build their nests and lay their eggs. Another threat to the Brazilian merganser is tourism. The scenic beauty of Serra de Canastra National Park brings people from around the world to see the ecotourism landmark. Tourists are attracted to the abundant supply of clear water with over 150 waterfalls in the area. Sporting activities also create a disturbance for the Brazilian mergansers. Activities such as canoeing and rafting disturb the natural habitats for the Brazilian mergansers that thrive on the rapid-rivers, interrupting breeding patterns. Water pollution and deforestation are also a concern as new facilities are built. Other threats include inbreeding, pesticides and predation. Very few individuals survive from these threats and extinction may be imminent. People hunting the birds for food and collecting them for exhibition specimens contributed to the decline of the species. References *Argentina Guide. \\"Nature in Iguazu\\". Enjoy Argentina.

Education and experience Born to Harry Kozol and Ruth (Massell) Kozol, Jonathan graduated from Noble and Greenough School in 1954,Leaders from the 1960s: A Biographical Sourcebook of American Activism, By David De Leon and Harvard University summa cum laude in 1958 with an A.B. in English literature. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford. He did not, however, complete his scholarship, deciding instead to go to Paris to learn to write fiction and nonfiction from experienced authors such as William Styron, Richard Wright, and others who were living in Paris at the time. It was upon his return that he began to tutor children in Roxbury, MA, and soon became a teacher in the Boston Public Schools. He was fired for teaching a Langston Hughes poem, as described in Death at an Early Age, and then became deeply involved in the civil rights movement. After being fired from Boston Public Schools, he was offered a position to teach at Newton Public Schools, the school district he attended as a child, and taught there for several years before becoming more deeply involved in social justice work and dedicating more time to writing. Kozol has since held two Guggenheim Fellowships, has twice been a fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation, and has also received fellowships from the Field and Ford Foundations. Kozol also has worked in the field of social psychology. He has been working with children in inner-city schools for more than forty years.Kozol, Jonathan (2007). \\"Letters to a Young Teacher\\", p. 289. Three Rivers Press, New York. . Kozol is currently on the editorial board of Greater Good Magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Kozol's contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. Writing career Kozol at Pomona College, 2003 Death at an Early Age, his first non-fiction book, is a description of his first year as a teacher in the Boston Public Schools. It was published in 1967 and won the National Book Award in Science, Philosophy and Religion. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1968\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-05. It has sold more than two million copies in the United States and Europe. Among the other books by Kozol are Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America, which received the Robert F. Kennedy Book award for 1989 and the Conscience-in-Media Award of the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools, which won the New England Book Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992. His 1995 book, Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation, described his visits to the South Bronx of New York City, the poorest congressional district in the United States. It received the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award in 1996. He published Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope in 2000 and The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America was released September 13, 2005. Kozol documents the continuing and often worsening segregation in public schools in the United States, and the increasing influence of neoconservative ideology on the way children, particularly children of color and poor children of urban areas, are educated. Kozol, \\"Still Separate, Still Unequal: America's Educational Apartheid\\" published in Harper's Magazine (v.311, n.1864, September 1, 2005), essay adapted from The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America. He is still active in advocating for integrated public education in the United States and is a critic of the school voucher movement. He continues to condemn the inequalities of education and the apparently worsening segregation of black and Hispanic children from white children in the segregated public schools of almost every major city of the nation. Kozol's ethical argument relies heavily on comparisons between rich and poor school districts. In particular, he analyzes the amount of money spent per child. He finds that in school districts whose taxpayers and property-owners are relatively wealthy, the per-child annual spending is much higher (for example, over $20,000 per year per child in one district) than in school districts where poor people live (for example, $11,000 per year per child in one district). He asks rhetorically whether it is right that the place of one's birth should determine the quality of one's education. Non-profit Kozol founded The Education Action Fund, which serves as a nonprofit charitable fund that provides direct assistance to many of the children and families profiled in Jonathan‚Äôs books. Donations to the EAF go directly towards children and families living in impoverished or racially isolated areas, and often provide a much-needed relief from financial instability.

Fundraising In 2000 and 2002, one-third of the committee's $210.8 million raised was in soft money donations. The committee held record-breaking events featuring President George W. Bush. After the ban of soft money donations, the NRCC's fundraising sources and techniques have been criticized. For the 2004 election cycle, its top three donors included two Indian tribal clients of Jack Abramoff. Others include gambling interests (also related to Abramoff).http://www.capitaleye.org/abramoff_recips_detail.asp?type=R&Name;=National+Republican+Congressional+Cmte On September 21, 2006 Chairman Tom Reynolds met with lobbyists in Washington, D.C. to warn them to contribute only to Republicans and not to challengers from the Democratic Party because their donations would be tracked and they would lose favors among the Republican members of Congress. Similar activities of the K Street Project occurred when Davis was head of the NRCC; the organization was fined by the Federal Election Commission for transferring funds between PACs for the same candidates in violation of contribution limits. The NRCC has also offered awards such as \\"Physician of the Year\\", \\"Businessman of the Year\\", \\"Columnist of the Year\\" and \\"Congressional Order of Merit\\" to very few individuals each year. Washington Post archive Automated phone calls In 2006, just days before the November 7 midterm congressional elections, there were numerous reports of a series of automated phone calls (\\"robocalls\\") being authorized by the NRCC, with the apparent intention to confuse and annoy the supporters of Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives. The automated call would typically begin by saying, \\"Hello, I'm calling with information about ___\\" and naming the Democratic candidate. If the recipient hung up, the call would be repeated, often several times, thus leading voters to believe incorrectly that the Democratic campaign was harassing them. The NRCC used the tactic in at least 53 competitive House races. In New Hampshire, the state attorney general's office requested that the NRCC end the robocalls, but many individuals in the state continued to report receiving them. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent the NRCC a cease-and-desist letter. The DCCC letter cited the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation requiring that a prerecorded telephone call must identify the responsible entity at the beginning of the message, and must include the entity's telephone number. Because the NRCC's calls did not name the NRCC at the beginning and did not provide a contact phone number, the DCCC charged the NRCC with \\"a pattern of willful noncompliance with FCC requirements\\".https://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/NRCC%20ceasedesist.pdf Embezzlement On March 13, 2008 the NRCC stated that its former treasurer, Christopher J. Ward, had apparently transferred \\"several hundred thousand dollars\\" in NRCC funds to \\"his personal and business bank accounts\\". An estimated $724,000 in losses were embezzled from the NRCC by Ward between 2001 and 2007.Bresnahan, John. NRCC settles embezzlement case. Politico. June 11, 2010. Ward has served as treasurer for 83 Republican committees and has done work for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. On June 6, 2008 the Department of Justice, in filing a civil forfeiture proceeding against Ward's house, alleged that Ward \\"made over $500,000 in unauthorized withdrawals\\" and that he used the money to make his mortgage payments and for home renovation. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) conducted a probe into disclosure reports submitted by the NRCC during Ward's tenure as treasurer. Guy Harrison, the executive director of NRCC, agreed to pay a $10,000 civil fine and signed a conciliation agreement with the FEC on June 10, 2010. On December 2, 2010, a federal judge sentenced Ward to 37 months in prison for stealing more than $844,000 from the NRCC and other political fundraising committees for whom he worked as treasurer.Hsu, Spencer S. \\"NRCC official sentenced in theft\\" (December 2, 2010) washingtonpost.com 2008 congressional elections In 2008 the NRCC concentrated on trying to help incumbent Republicans win re-election. Even so, the committee had to make \\"triage\\"-type decisions about allocating its funds. In October 2008, it canceled several hundred thousand dollars worth of television advertising time slated for the re-election campaigns of Michele Bachmann, Marilyn Musgrave, and Tom Feeney, having concluded that they could not win. The decision drew criticism from the conservative Family Research Council, which stated, \\"It appears that the NRCC is abandoning social conservative candidates and the issues for which they stand‚Ä¶.\\" Bachmann was the only one of those three who was successfully re-elected, winning a plurality of 46% of the vote in a three-way race. 2010 congressional elections In 2010, Republican candidates won a historic number of seats in the House of Representatives.Seib, G.

Life and career  Haven Kimmel was born Susan Elizabeth Jarvis (\\"Betsy\\") in New Castle, Indiana, and was raised in Mooreland, Indiana, the focus of her bestselling memoir, A Girl Named Zippy: Growing up Small in Mooreland, Indiana (2001). The book is written from the perspective of Kimmel as a young girl, and in it she sheds light on the townspeople of Mooreland living there in the 1960s and 1970s during the author's childhood. The name of the memoir stems from the nickname her father had for her growing up; however, Kimmel does not publicly share her real given name, which she changed to Haven Skye at age 18 after Kentucky folk singer Haven Hughes. Her second memoir, She Got Up Off the Couch, and Other Heroic Acts from Mooreland, Indiana, is more history of her childhood, but it also tells the story of her mother, Delonda, who decided to return to college in her middle-age years to eventually became a teacher. Kimmel states she never had the desire to become a writer when she grew up, but by the time she was 21, she says she had \\"given her life over to poetry,\\" which she would go on to write for the next 15 years. Kimmel earned her undergraduate degree in English and creative writing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana and a graduate degree from North Carolina State University, where she studied with novelist Lee Smith. She also attended seminary at the Earlham School of Religion in Richmond, Indiana. She lives in Durham, North Carolina, has been married three times and has three children (Kat, Obadiah and Augusten- named after American writer Augusten Burroughs). Haven Kimmel was a poet prior to writing the memoir of her early childhood. The Solace of Leaving Early (2002) and Something Rising (Light and Swift) (2004) are the first two novels in Kimmel's \\"trilogy of place\\" about fictional Hopwood County, Indiana. The third book, released in September 2007, is titled The Used World. Her other works include a second memoir, She Got Up Off the Couch (2005), a poetic children's book, Orville: A Dog Story (2003), and a retelling of the Book of Revelation in Killing the Buddha: A Heretic's Bible (2004), edited by Peter Manseau and Jeff Sharlet (). Her most recent published works include a children's book, Kaline Klattermaster's Tree House (2008), and the novel Iodine (2008), a psychological tale about a young woman with dark secrets.

(From A Girl Named Zippy, p. 2.) * Possibility, infinity, beauty‚Äînone of those words were right. [...] What he really wanted to say was: have you felt this? this phantom life streaking like a phosphorescent hound at the edges of your ruin? (From The Solace of Leaving Early, p. 40.) * Orville barked and barked against his chain. And right in the middle of a long summer day, when he had barked about how he was really a good dog in a bad mood, and how he missed that one-eyed doll, and how there was something so terrible about the feeling of a chain against a neck, everything changed, because a girl with cotton-candy hair moved into the little house across the road and Orville fell in love. (From Orville: A Dog Story, p. 18.) * \\"It's marriage, family, home, sentimentality, continuity, these are the lies that eat women like a machine.\\" [...] \\"A Woman- Chipper, can you imagine how that would sell? Everyone, anywhere on the political spectrum, would want one.\\" (From Something Rising (Light and Swift), p. 126.) * \\"She had done all these things and she was going to graduate summa cum laude, which meant Good But Loud, from the Honors College, and she had done it all in twenty-three months. It takes some people more time to hang a curtain.\\" She Got Up Off the Couch, p. 189.) * \\"Once she had been thought dear, a treasure, the little red-haired Holiness girl whose laughter sparkled like light on a lake; now she stood outside the gates of her father's Prophecy, asleep inside his house. Her hair tumbled across her pillow and over the edge of the bed: a flame. [...] It was mid-December in Jonah, Indiana, a place where Fate can be decided by the weather, and a storm was gathering overhead.\\" (From The Used World, pp. 2‚Äì3.) * \\"Do Not Walk on Grass!\\" (From Kaline Klattermaster's Tree House, p. 1.) * She drifted; fell into the horizon dream, which was sometimes a comfort and sometimes disconcerting. That's all the dream was: an endless horizon, everywhere she turned, no ground beneath her feet, no sky above. A line where two concepts either met or parted ways. No sun rose, no moon. The Horae were the seasons and their names signified time (heure): Lachesis, experience, or the accident in destiny. Clotho the inborn disposition. And Atropos, the ineluctable, Death Herself. Ianthe dreamed warm, the horizon did not alter, she thought of Weeds, and of the dark freezing house down the lane that no one could see. Colt never entered her mind. (From Iodine, p 150.)

Unlike PReP, CHRP incorporated elements of the Power Macintosh architecture and was intended to support the classic Mac OS and NetWare, in addition to the four operating systems that had been ported to PReP at the time (Windows NT, OS/2, Solaris, and AIX). CHRP did not receive industry-wide adoption, however. The only systems to ship with actual CHRP hardware are certain members of IBM's RS/6000 series running AIX.

It has a capacity of 29,000. \\"Ostseestadion\\" translates in English to \\"Baltic Sea Stadium\\", and is named after the Baltic Sea, whose coast Rostock lies upon. Ostseestadion is the original name of the stadium, but on 2 July 2007, Hansa Rostock sold the naming rights for the following 10 years to Deutsche Kreditbank (DKB), hence the new official name became \\"DKB Arena\\". In 2015, the club announced that the stadium was to regain its original name, and that the DKB had allowed an early renaming of the stadium and agreed to end the naming contract in advance. Location Aerial view of the Ostseestadion. The Ostseestadion is located in the German city of Rostock in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Within Rostock, it is situated not far from the city centre in the Hansaviertel part of town near several hospitals of the University of Rostock and a small forest called Barnstorfer Wald'. Moreover, an ice hockey stadium as well as several training pitches of Hansa Rostock are just adjacent to the Ostseestadion. The stadium can be reached easily from all parts of Rostock by public transport, using buses (stop Ostseestadion) or the S-Bahn (stop Holbeinplatz). Public transport is free with a valid ticket for a home match three hours before and two hours after the actual match. History The stadium was newly built in 2001 on the site of a former stadium built in 1954. At the end of the 1960s a new 700 lux lighting system was added, which is still in use today. Seating Interior in 2007 The total capacity of 29,000 places includes 1000 \\"business seats\\" as well as a standing capacity of 9,000.

Obsolete names for the breed include Shepherd's Dog and '. The nickname Bob-tail (or Bobtail) originates from how dogs of the breed traditionally had their tails docked. Old English Sheepdogs can grow very long coats with fur covering the face and eyes and do not shed unless brushed. Appearance Beneath the Old English Sheepdog's profuse double coat is a muscular and compact drover, with plenty of bone and a big rump, standing 21 or 22 inches at the shoulder. Their eyes (when you can see them) are dark brown, or blue, or one of each. The OES breed standard says the skull is ‚Äúcapacious and rather squarely formed, giving plenty of room for brain power.‚ÄùOES move with a bear-like shuffle but are famous for their nimbleness afoot. Regular exercise is required for these strong, able-bodied workers. Equally famed are their many fine housedog qualities: watchfulness, courage, kindliness, and intelligence. Great with children, OES make patient, protective playmates. They are sensible watchdogs known for a loud, ringing bark.The Old English Sheepdog is a large dog, immediately recognizable by its long, thick, shaggy grey and white coat, with fur covering their face and eyes. The ears lie flat to the head. Historically, the breed's tail was commonly docked (resulting in a panda bear-like rear end), but tailed Old English sheepdogs are now common, as many countries have outlawed cosmetic docking. When the dog has a tail, it has long fur (feathering), is low set, and normally hangs down.F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale Breed Standard The Old English Sheepdog stands lower at the shoulder than at the loin, and walks with a \\"bear-like roll from the rear\\". Height at the withers is at least 61 cm (24 in), with females slightly smaller than males. The body is short and compact, and ideal weights are not specified in the breed standards, but may be as much as 46 kg (101 lb) for large males. Colour of the double coat may be any shade of grey, grizzle, black, blue, or blue merle, with optional white markings. The undercoat is water resistant. Puppies are born with a black and white coat, and it is only after the puppy coat has been shed that the more common grey or silver shaggy hair appears. Old English Sheepdogs only shed when they are brushed. Docking Undocked Old English Sheepdogs are becoming a more common sight as many countries have now banned docking (such as Canada). The Kennel Club (UK) and The Australian National Kennel Council breed standards do not express a preference for (legally) docked or un-docked animals, and either can be shown. The American Kennel Club breed standard states that the tail should be \\"docked close to the body, when not naturally \\", even though the practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.AVMA.org It is believed that the practice of tail docking came about in the 18th century as a result of taxation laws that required working dogs to be docked as evidence of their working status, but nowadays, in places where the practice is still legal, tail docking is mainly performed for purely cosmetic reasons. History Ch. Slumber, best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1914, one of the two times an Old English Sheepdog has won there. The Old English Sheepdog comes from the pastoral type dogs of England. A small drop-eared dog seen in a 1771 painting by Gainsborough is believed by some to represent the early type of the Old English Sheepdog.Greater London Old English Sheepdog Club Breed History In the early 19th century a bobtailed drovers dog, called the Smithfield or Cotswold Cor, was noticed in the southwestern counties of England and may have been an ancestor. Most fanciers agree that the Bearded Collie was among the original stock used in developing today's breed. Some speculate that the Russian Owtchar was among the breed's ancestors. The Old English Sheepdog was at first called the \\"Shepherd's Dog\\" and was exhibited for the first time at a show in Birmingham, England, in 1873. There were only three entries, and the judge felt the quality of the dogs was so poor that he offered only a second placing. From that beginning, the breed became a popular show dog, and, although the shape of the dog itself has changed very little over the years, elaborate grooming including backcombing and powdering the fur was recorded as early as 1907. The breed was exported to the United States in the 1880s, and by the turn of the 20th century, five of the ten wealthiest American families bred and showed the Old English Sheepdog. The breed continues to be a popular show dog today. The best recent finish of an Old English Sheepdog at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show was in 2013 when Bugaboo's Picture Perfect was awarded Reserve Best in Show. Health US and UK surveys put the average lifespan of the Old English Sheepdog at 10‚Äì11 years. The Old English Sheepdog Club of America sponsors investigations into diseases encountered in the breed in order to assist breeders in selecting healthy dogs for breeding, and breeders of Old English Sheepdogs who are members of the Old English Sheepdog Club of America must support its Code of Ethics in breeding and selling sheepdogs. Some diseases being investigated include hip dysplasia, cataracts, glaucoma, entropion, thyroid problems, deafness, diabetes, HD, PRA, allergies and skin problems. There is no data on how many dogs are affected, or what percent of the breed is affected by any of these ailments. Heatstroke is also a serious concern in full coated dogs.The Old English Sheepdog, by Kim D. R. Dearth, Dog World Magazine, March 2001 online Cancer is a major cause of death amongst Old English Sheepdogs. Temperament The breed standards describe the ideal Old English Sheepdog as never being nervous or aggressive. The New Zealand Kennel Club adds that \\"they are sometimes couch potatoes\\" and \\"may even try to herd children by gently bumping them.\\" This breed's temperament can be described as intelligent, social and adaptable. The American Kennel Club adds that the breed has \\"a clownish energy\\" and \\"may try to herd people or other objects.\\" With wide open spaces being the ideal setting for an Old English Sheepdog, the breed is a natural fit in a rural setting, such as working on a farm; although, with proper exercise and training, they are perfectly comfortable with a suburban or urban lifestyle. Old English Sheepdogs should not be deprived of the company and the warmth of people. Activities The Old English Sheepdog can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Old English Sheepdogs that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.  Coat care  An Old English Sheepdog in a shorter coat clip. The Old English Sheepdog's long coat requires a thorough brushing at least once weekly, which may take one to three hours. Without regular care, the coat can become \\"a trap for dust, debris, fecal matter, urine and moisture.\\" Matting may become painful to the animal, such as in between the toes, and can restrict movement in severe cases. Prospective owners may be deterred by the level of care required if long hair is desired. The preferred method of grooming involves starting from the base of the hairs to keep the thick undercoat hair mat- and tangle-free. The brushing should be started at a very young age to get the dog used to it. A hairband may be used to keep a dog's fur out of its eyes. Many people trim their dogs' coats to a more manageable length. A professional quality electric shear reduces time spent trimming. However, dogs that are being shown in conformation must retain their natural coat. Some people shave their Sheepdog's hair and spin it into yarn. Dulux Dog The Old English Sheepdog is the brand mascot for Dulux paint. The dog was first introduced in Australian advertising campaigns in the 1960s. Since then they have been a constant and highly popular feature of Dulux television and print advertisements in Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the UK, and people in those markets refer colloquially to the breed as a \\"Dulux dog\\". Over the years, different dogs have appeared in the advertisements, all very similar in appearance, as most of them have been selected from a closely related line of pedigree dogs. The first Dulux dog was Shepton Dash, who held the role for eight years. His successor, Fernville Lord Digby, was the most famous Dulux dog and also made his owner, Cynthia Harrison, famous. When filming commercials, Digby was treated like a star and was driven to the studio by a chauffeur. Barbara Woodhouse was employed to train Digby and his three stunt doubles, who were used whenever specific tricks or actions needed to be filmed. Apart from Dash, all the Dulux dogs have been breed champions. Five of them have won 'Best of Show' prizes. The most recent Dulux Dog, Don, is Crufts Qualified.

Published by IBM in 1994, it allowed hardware vendors to build a machine that could run various operating systems, including Windows NT, OS/2, Solaris, Taligent and AIX. One of the stated goals of the PReP specification was to leverage standard PC hardware, and thus PReP was essentially a PC clone with a PowerPC CPU. Apple, wishing to seamlessly transition its Macintosh computers to PowerPC, found this to be particularly problematic. As it appeared no one was particularly happy with PReP, a new standard, the Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP), was developed and published in late 1995, incorporating the elements of both PReP and the Power Macintosh architecture. Key to CHRP was the requirement for Open Firmware (also required in PReP-compliant systems delivered after June 1, 1995), which gave vendors greatly improved support during the boot process, allowing the hardware to be far more varied. PReP systems were never popular. Finding current, readily available operating systems for old PReP hardware can be difficult. Debian and NetBSD still maintain their respective ports to this architecture, although developer and user activity is extremely low. The RTEMS real-time operating system provides a board support package for PReP which can be run utilizing the QEMU PReP emulator. This provides a convenient development environment for PowerPC-based real-time, embedded systems.

The Sinfonia was generally open to anyone and ended up drawing players who were either people without musical training or, if they were musicians, ones that chose to play an instrument that was entirely new to them. Among the founding members was one of their teachers, English composer Gavin Bryars. The orchestra started as a one-off, tongue-in-cheek performance art ensemble but became a cultural phenomenon over the following 10 years, with concerts, record albums, a film and a hit single. They last performed publicly in 1979. History Bryars was interested more in experimenting with the nature of music than forming a traditional orchestra. Instead of picking the most competent musicians he could find, he encouraged anyone to join, regardless of talent, ability or experience. The only rules were that everyone had to come for rehearsals and that people should try their best to get it right and not intentionally try to play badly. The first recording made by the Sinfonia was a flexi disc of Rossini's William Tell Overture, which was sent out as the invitation for the degree show that year. The early repertoire of the Sinfonia was drawn from standard classical repertoire (such as \\"The Blue Danube\\" waltz and Also sprach Zarathustra), so that most orchestra members had a rough idea of what the piece should sound like, even if they could not play their chosen instrument accurately. In later years, the group's repertoire would expand to popular music, including rock and roll. Many modern composers and musicians found this to be interesting and even profound; the comedic aspects of the music were merely a bonus, though it was used extensively for marketing purposes. Brian Eno was interested enough to join the orchestra, playing clarinet, and subsequently producing their first two albums. The orchestra was invited by the composer Michael Parsons to play the Purcell Room at London's Royal Festival Hall. Their first album, Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics, was released in 1974. The album peaked at number 88 in Australia. On 28 May 1974, as their fame increased, they played a concert at the Royal Albert Hall with conductor John Farley which sold thousands of tickets. The orchestra's take on the late 1970s and early 1980s vogue for pop classical medleys, \\"Classical Muddly\\" ‚Äì produced by their manager Martin Lewis and released by Springtime!/Island Records in 1981 ‚Äì is characteristic of their sound; it was inspired by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's \\"Hooked on Classics\\". The single, which consisted of the group's previous recordings sped up, amalgamated and synchronized to a disco beat, was a top 40 hit in the UK Singles Chart. As the years passed, the musicians eventually became accustomed to, and more skilled at playing their instruments, which diminished the novelty of the group. Although the group never formally disbanded, it ceased performing in 1979. A recording of the sinfonia playing the beginning of Also sprach Zarathustra has achieved some fame as an internet meme under the moniker \\"orchestra fail\\", further gaining popularity on YouTube via references from musician Devin Townsend. The recording was used as the walk-on music for Swedish band Peter Bjorn and John during their 2011 \\"Gimme Some\\" tour in the US. The Portsmouth Sinfonia was the subject of a 2011 BBC Radio 4 documentary presented by Jolyon Jenkins in the series \\"In Living Memory\\". In the programme Gavin Bryars disputed the notion that members were required to be novices at their instruments, saying that it was a \\"scurrilous rumour put about by the BBC\\". Michael Nyman created a similar outfit called Foster's Social Orchestra, which is heard on the soundtrack of the 1999 film Ravenous.

Description This striking sea duck has a thin red bill and a scaled dark pattern on the flanks and rump. Both sexes have a crest of wispy elongated feathers, reaching almost to the shoulders in adult males and being fairly short in females and immatures. The adult male has a black head and neck, white breast and underparts, and blackish mantle and wings, except for the white innerwings. The scaling is also black, while the tail is medium grey. The female has a buffish head and otherwise replaces the male's black with grey colour. The legs are orange-red and the irides dark brown in both sexes. Ecology Their breeding habitat is rivers in primary forest in the southeastern Russian Far East, perhaps in North Korea, and in two locations Changbai Mountains and small isolated location in Lesser Xingan Mnts. in northeastern China. The bulk of the species' population breed in Russian Far East (85%) and Changbaishan both in China and DPRKSolovyeva D.V., Liu P., Antonov A.I., Averin A.A., Pronkevich V.V., Shokhrin V.P., Vartanyan S.L., Cranswick P.A. 2014.

Endangered Species Research 17: 217‚Äì225. This shy and easily startled bird favors mid-sized rivers which meander through wide expanses of mixed forest in the mountains, up to 1,000 meters ASL or less. Birds tend to move upriver during the day, both when startled and when foraging; the latter is probably because stirred-up sediments will alert and hide prey downstream. Food is caught with the serrated beak from among the riverbed gravel. Often the birds dive for prey, repeatedly submerging for a quarter-to half-minute with only a few seconds pause between dives. In shallow water, the birds submerge only the head; they do not upend. The birds are not very social during breeding period and they gather in small groups in autumn and winter. Even on the wintering grounds, groups of more than a dozen are very rare.Zhengjie & Zhengjie (1998) Solovieva, D.V. 2002. Foraging behaviour and daily time budget of Scaly-sided Merganser Mergus squamatus breeding on the Iman River, Russia. Wildfowl 53: 205-13. They spend most of the daylight time foraging, except around noon when they take some time to rest, preen and socialize at the river banks, where they also sleep. The food of M. squamatus consists of aquatic arthropods, frogs and small to medium-sized fish. Stonefly (Plecoptera) and Phryganeidae giant caddisfly larvae may constitute the bulk of its diet when available. Beetles and crustaceans are eaten less regularly, though the latter may be more important in autumn. As aquatic insect larvae hatch in the course of the summer, fish become more prominent in the diet. Favorite fish species include the dojo loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) and the lenok Brachymystax lenok. More rarely eaten are such species as the lamprey Eudontomyzon morii, the sculpin Mesocottus haitej, or the Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). Thus, they are opportunistic feeders; regarding fish, they will probably eat any species that has the correct elongated shape and small size. Scaly-sided mergansers nest in trees, as typical for the merganser and goldeneye lineage of sea ducks. Preferred nesting trees are such species as daimyo oak (Quercus dentata, ), Chozenia, Linden and Ussuri poplar (Populus ussuriensis, Â§ßÈùíÊù®; a balsam poplar). Easy breed in artificial nest boxes on the rivers with destroyed forests on banks. They are sympatric with Mandarin ducks (Aix galericulata); perhaps competing for nesting holes (which neither can excavate themselves). In its winter quarters, the scaly-sided merganser might compete with other Merginae with which it shares its habitat then, e.g. common mergansers (M. merganser) and common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula). Status This species is considered endangered by the IUCN. Its numbers declined in the 1960s and 1970s due to loss of primary forests in its limited range, particularly along the major rivers in Russia. Current threats include illegal hunting, entanglement in (ghost) fishing nets and river pollution, as well as ongoing destruction of forest. According to its current IUCN classification EN C2a(ii), fewer than 5000 adult and first and second year old birds remain, and most of these are found in Primorye and South Khabarovsk regions of Russia (85%) World population survey was completed in 2014 both in Russia and China, the number for North Korea was estimated without survey there. Surveys on dispersal wintering grounds are useless and the way to estimate world population is to survey pristine rivers within breeding range. Rivers of Central China, primarily tributaries of Yangtze River, and all rivers of South Korea constitutes the wintering area well known nowadays. Habitat loss in China led to breeding range reduction and fragmentation there.Fen-Qi et al. (2002), BLI (2006, 2008), Solovyeva et al. 2014 In Russia population seems to stabilize in 1900th and until now. Threats and conservation measures Winter ecology and conservation threats to the scaly-sided merganser were reported in 2012. Threats include sand mining, fishing, riparian vegetation destruction, habitat fragmentation, and water pollution. Recommended conservation measures include provision of artificial nest boxes,Solovyeva, D.V., Vartanayan, S.L., & N. I-F. Vartanayan. 2013.

Due to Mac OS X not requiring the availability of the Toolbox, this allowed ROM sizes to shrink dramatically (typically from to ), and facilitated the use of flash memory for system firmware instead of the now more expensive and less flexible Mask ROM that most previous Macs used. A facility for loading the Toolbox from the startup device was, however, made available, allowing the use of Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 on New World machines. The New World architecture was developed for the Macintosh Network Computer, an unrealized project that eventually contributed several key technologies to the first-generation iMac. All PowerPC Macs from the iMac, the iBook, the Blue and White Power Mac G3 and the Bronze Keyboard (Lombard) PowerBook G3 forward are New World ROM machines, while all previous models (including the Beige Power Mac G3 and all other beige and platinum Macs) are Old World ROM machines. Intel based Macs are incapable of running Mac OS 9 (or, indeed, any version of Mac OS X prior to Tiger), and on these machines EFI is used instead of Open Firmware, which both New World and Old World machines are based on. New World ROM Macs are the first Macs where direct usage of the Open Firmware (OF) subsystem is encouraged. Previous PCI Power Macs used Open Firmware for booting, but the implementation was not complete; in these machines OF was only expected to probe PCI devices, then immediately hand control over to the Mac OS ROM. Because of this, versions 1.0.5 and 2.x had several serious bugs, as well as missing functionality (such as being able to load files from a HFS partition or a TFTP server). Apple also set the default input and output devices to (the modem port on beige Macs), which made it difficult for normal users to get to Open Firmware; to do so it was necessary to either hook up a terminal, or change the Open Firmware settings from inside Mac OS using a tool such as Boot Variables or Apple's System Disk. The New World ROM introduced a much-improved version of the Open Firmware interpreter, version 3.0, which added many missing features, fixed most of the bugs from earlier versions, and had the capability to run CHRP boot scripts. The Toolbox ROM was embedded inside a CHRP script in the System Folder called \\"Mac OS ROM\\", along with a short loader stub and a copy of the Happy Mac icon suitable for display from Open Firmware. Once the ROM was loaded from disk, the Mac boot sequence continued as usual. As before, Open Firmware could also run a binary boot loader, and version 3.0 added support for ELF objects as well as the XCOFF files versions 1.0.5 and 2.0 supported. Also, version 3.0 (as well as some of the last releases of version 2.x, starting with the PowerBook 3400) officially supported direct access to the Open Firmware command prompt from the console (by setting the auto-boot? variable to false from Mac OS, or by holding down --- at boot). One major difference between Old World ROM Macs and New World ROM Macs, at least in classic Mac OS, is that the Gestalt selector for the machine type is no longer usable; all New World ROM Macs use the same mach ID, 406 decimal, and the actual machine ID is encoded in the \\"model\\" and \\"compatible\\" properties of the root node of the Open Firmware device tree. The New World ROM also sets the \\"compatible\\" property of the root node to \\"MacRISC2\\" (machines that can boot classic Mac OS using \\"Mac OS ROM\\") or \\"MacRISC3\\" (machines that can only boot Mac OS X or another Unix- like system). It is somewhat easier to boot a non-Mac-OS operating system on a New World system, and indeed OpenBSD's bootloader only works on a New World system. The simplest way to distinguish a New World ROM Mac is that it will have a factory built-in USB port. No Old World ROM Mac had a USB port as factory equipment; instead, they used ADB for keyboard and mouse, and mini- DIN-8 \\"modem\\" and \\"printer\\" serial ports for other peripherals. Also, New World ROM Macs generally do not have a built-in floppy drive.

It was factory-installed in passenger vehicles, trucks and vans, commercial vehicles, marine and industrial applications from 1964 through 2003. The combustion chambers are wedge-shaped, rather than the polyspherical combustion chambers in the predecessor A engine or the hemispherical combustion chambers in the Chrysler Hemi engine. All versions are made of cast iron, except for the Viper V10 which is aluminum. LA engines have the same bore spacing as the A engines. LA engines were made at Chrysler's Mound Road Engine plant in Detroit, Michigan, as well as plants in Canada and Mexico. The \\"LA\\" stands for \\"Light A\\", as the older \\"A\\" engine it was closely based on was nearly 50 pounds heavier. Willem Weertman, who later became Chief Engineer ‚Äì Engine Design and Development, was in charge of the conversion. The basic design of the LA engine would go unchanged through the development of the \\"Magnum\\" upgrade (1992-1993) and into the 2000s with changes to enhance power and efficiency. 239 V6 The V6 was released in 1987 for use in the Dodge Dakota and a replacement for the older, longer slant-6. It is essentially a six-cylinder version of the 318 V8. Output was and until it was replaced by the Magnum 3.9 starting in 1992. In 1987 it used a two-barrel Holley carburetor and hydraulic tappets. In 1988 it was upgraded with throttle-body fuel injection and roller tappets which it retained until the 1992 Magnum update. Next, in the 1992 Magnum update, the throttle-body fuel injection was upgraded to a multi-point fuel injection. The engine was produced through 2004 before it was replaced with the 3.7 L Power Tech V6. * 1987‚Äì1991 Dodge Dakota * 1992‚Äì2004 Dodge Dakota Magnum * 1988‚Äì1991 Dodge Ram * 1992‚Äì2001 Dodge Ram Magnum * 1988‚Äì1991 Dodge Ram Van * 1992‚Äì2003 Dodge Ram Van Magnum 273 V8 The was the first LA engine, beginning model year 1964 and offered through 1969, rated at . It had a bore and stroke of . It had a mechanical solid lifter valvetrain until 1968 when hydraulic lifters were introduced; hydraulic lifters generally make for a quieter valvetrain. The reciprocating assembly included a cast or forged steel crankshaft, drop forged steel connecting rods and cast aluminum pistons. The valvetrain consisted of a cast nodular iron camshaft, solid or hydraulic lifters, solid pushrods and shaft-mounted, malleable iron rocker arms (stamped steel on later hydraulic- cam engines). These actuated the overhead steel intake and exhaust valves. The cylinder heads featured wedge-shaped combustion chambers with a single intake and a single exhaust valve for each cylinder. Spark plugs were located in the side of the cylinder head, between the exhaust ports. A high performance was offered 1965-'67, this was standard in the Barracuda Formula S model and optional in all other compact models excluding station wagons. It featured a 4-bbl. carburetor and matching intake manifold, chrome unsilenced air cleaner with callout sticker, longer-duration and higher-lift camshaft and stronger valve springs, 10.5:1 compression ratio, special black wrinkle valve covers with cast aluminum appliques, and a low-restriction exhaust system with a exhaust pipe, collector-type Y-junction, and exposed resonator. In 1965 (only) the muffler was of \\"straight through\\" construction. A special version was also available in 1966 only - it used a lift solid-lifter camshaft, fabricated- steel-tube exhaust, and a Holley 4-barrel carburetor, producing (1 hp/cu in). It was available in the Dodge Dart only, and the car so equipped was called the \\"D-Dart\\", a reference to its classification in NHRA D-stock for drag racing, which was the car's only intended purpose. * 1964‚Äì1969 Dodge Dart * 1964‚Äì1969 Plymouth Barracuda * Plymouth Belvedere * Dodge Coronet * Plymouth Satellite * 1964‚Äì1969 Plymouth Valiant * 1966‚Äì1967 Ghia 450 SS 318 V8 The LA 318 was a relative of the A 318.

The LA engine was available until 1991 when it was superseded by the Magnum version (See below). It used hydraulic lifters and a two barrel carburetor for most of its production, though four-barrel Carter Thermo-Quad and Rochester Quadrajet carburetors were used in police applications starting in 1978. The 318 received roller lifters and a fast-burn cylinder head in 1985. Throttle-body electronic fuel injection was factory equipment on the 1981-1983 Imperial.

Its block was bored out to but stroke left unchanged, resulting in the engine introduced for the 1968 model year. Anticipating higher loads resulting from racing operation, the engineers fitted a forged shot peened steel crankshaft instead of the cast nodular iron unit used in the 318. This also included shot peened and forged pushrods, connecting rods and pistons. Its big ports used intake and exhaust valves. An aggressive cam was fitted to take advantage of the much better breathing top end. The 1968 4-speed cars got an even hotter cam, but it was discontinued for 1969, where both automatic and manual cars shared the same cam. The engine was equipped with hydraulic lifters and two bolt main bearing caps, leading some to initially underestimate the 340's potential. The 1968-'71 340's compression ratio was 10.5:1, placing it near the limit of what was possible on pump gasoline during that era. The 340 also used additional heavy-duty parts, such as a double-row roller timing chain and sump-mounted windage tray. Power output was officially stated as gross for the 4 barrel. In 1970, Chrysler offered a special Six-Pack version of the 340 with triple 2-barrel carburetors rated at gross that was specific to Challenger TA and Cuda AAR models. This version featured a heavy duty short block with additional webbing to allow for aftermarket installed 4 bolt main bearing caps. The application-specific cylinder heads featured relocated intake pushrod passages with offset rocker arms that allowed the pushrods to be moved away from the intake ports, which could improve airflow if the pushrod-clearance \\"hump\\" was ground away from the intake port by the end user. An aluminum intake manifold mounted three Holley carburetors, and a dual points ignition system was fitted. The combination of rising gasoline prices and insurance company crackdown on high-performance vehicles saw the relatively expensive 340 detuned and phased out. It remained a high performance engine through 1971, but was de-tuned in 1972 with the introduction of low compression (8.5:1) small valve heads, and by mid-year, a cast nodular iron crankshaft, and a variety of other emissions related changes. For the 1974 model year it was replaced by the engine. * Chrysler Valiant Charger (Australia) * Dodge Challenger * Dodge Charger * Dodge Dart * 1971‚Äì1972 Dodge Demon * Dodge Super Bee * Plymouth Barracuda * Plymouth Duster * Plymouth Road Runner * Plymouth Sport Fury GT * Monica 560 * Hongqi CA770 215 HP 360 V8 V8 in a Li'l Red Express Truck The LA has a bore and stroke of .

In 1974, with the introduction of the code E58 4-BBl dual exhaust version, at SAE net, became the most powerful LA engine with the end of 340 production. Power started dropping from 1975 on as more emission controls were added resulting with the 1980 E58 engine only producing SAE net. Starting with 1981, the 360 was exclusively used in Dodge trucks and vans. The 1978-1979 Li'l Red Express truck used a special high-performance 360 4-barrel engine with factory production code EH1, and was the fastest American made vehicle from for those years.Car and Driver due in part, that as it was installed in a \\"truck\\", and not a car, it did not have to use catalytic converters which allowed for a free-flowing exhaust system.

Some police package cars came from the factory with a steel crank and h-beam rods. There was also a \\"lean burn\\" version of the 360. The LA360 was replaced in 1993 by the 5.9 Magnum, which shared some design parameters with the LA360, however the majority of its components were different. * Chrysler 300 * Chrysler Valiant & Valiant Charger (Australia) * Chrysler by Chrysler (Australia) * 1975‚Äì1979 Chrysler Cordoba * 1978‚Äì1979 Chrysler LeBaron * 1977‚Äì1981 Chrysler New Yorker * 1971‚Äì1981 Chrysler Newport * 1976‚Äì1980 Dodge Aspen * 1974 Dodge Challenger * 1974‚Äì1978 Dodge Charger * 1974‚Äì1976 Dodge Coronet * 1974‚Äì1976 Dodge Dart * 1978‚Äì1979 Dodge Diplomat * 1978‚Äì1979 Dodge Magnum * 1971‚Äì1978 Dodge Monaco * 1971‚Äì1973 Dodge Polara * 1971‚Äì1980 Dodge D Series * 1981‚Äì2002 Dodge Ram * 1979‚Äì2002 Dodge Ram Van/Dodge Ram Wagon * 1971‚Äì2001 Dodge Sportsman/Dodge Tradesman * 1974‚Äì2001 Dodge Ramcharger * 1974-1981 Plymouth Trail Duster * 1974-1975 Plymouth Road Runner * 1974 Plymouth Barracuda * 1974‚Äì1976 Plymouth Duster * 1971‚Äì1978 Plymouth Fury * 1975‚Äì1977, 1980 Plymouth Gran Fury * 1974‚Äì1983 Plymouth Voyager * 1979‚Äì1981 Dodge St. Regis * 1976‚Äì1980 Plymouth Volare and Dodge Minivans * 1978‚Äì1979 Dodge Lil' Red Express * (in Bristol-modified form) ** Bristol 603 ** Bristol 412 * (in Bristol-modified form with turbocharger) ** Bristol Beaufighter ** Bristol Brigand ** Bristol Beaufort Interim solutions: the throttle body injected LA engines The last variation of the LA series to be introduced before the Magnum upgrade was the 1988-92 throttle-body fuel injection, roller cam engine. The first engines to receive these modifications were the V8 and V6 engines. A Holley/Chrysler-designed, single-point, twin-injector throttle body assembly that was mounted atop a slightly re-designed cast iron intake manifold. An in-tank electric pump and reservoir replaced the earlier mechanical (camshaft-eccentric driven) pump. The valvetrain was upgraded to include hydraulic roller lifters, however cam specs remained essentially unchanged. The resulting engine was somewhat improved as to power and efficiency, and the 5.9 L V8 engines followed suit in 1989, it received improved \\"308\\" cylinder heads. However, with other manufacturers already introducing the superior multi-point fuel injection system, Chrysler Corporation considered a more drastic upgrade program. As the TBI engines were being introduced, the new upgrade program was initiated in the Chrysler engineering department. In 1992, with emissions standards becoming ever more stringent in the United States, Chrysler Corporation released the first of the upgraded engines. Magnum engines In 1992, Chrysler introduced the first of a series of upgraded versions of the LA Engines. The company named their engine the \\"Magnum\\", a marketing term that had been used by the company previously to describe both the Dodge Magnum automobile and an earlier Dodge passenger car (only) engine series; the latter was based on the big-block B/RB V8 engines of the 1960s-70s. The Chrysler Magnum engines are a series of V6, V8, and V10 powerplants used in a number of Chrysler Corporation motor vehicles, as well as in marine and industrial applications. This family of gasoline-burning engines lasted for over a decade, were installed in vehicles sold across the globe, and were produced in the millions. Technical information The Magnum engine is a direct descendant of the Chrysler LA engine, which began with the V8 in 1964. While the Magnum 3.9, Magnum 5.2, and Magnum 5.9 (1992-up) engines were significantly based on the 239, the 318, and the 360 ‚Äî respectively ‚Äî many of the parts will not directly interchange and the Magnums are not technically LA engines; the only major parts that are actually unchanged are the connecting rods. The cylinder block remained basically the same. It was still a V-shaped, 90-degree design made of cast iron. The crankshaft, located to the bottom of the block by five main bearing caps, was cast nodular iron, and the eight connecting rods were forged steel. The pistons were cast aluminum, with a hypereutectic design. Cylinders were numbered from the front of the engine to the rear; cylinders 1, 3, 5 and 7 were found on the left (driver side) bank, or \\"bank 1\\", with the even numbers on the other bank. Coolant passages were located between the cylinders. The gerotor-type oil pump was located at the bottom rear of the engine, and provided oil to both the crankshaft main bearings and the cylinder heads (via the lifters and pushrods, as opposed to a drilled passage on LA engines). Chrysler's engineers also redesigned the oil seals on the crankshaft to improve anti-leak seal performance.L. Shepard & M Gingerella, \\"Magnum Engines\\", Chrysler Corp., 2000, ISBN The oil pan was also made from thicker steel, and was installed with a more leak-resistant silicone-rubber gasket. Gasoline was supplied to the intake manifold through a pair of steel rails that fed eight Bosch-type, top-fed, electronically actuated fuel injectors; there was one injector located in each intake runner. Each cylinder had its own injector, thus making the fuel system a \\"multi-point\\" type. Fuel pressure was regulated by a vacuum-controlled pressure regulator, located on the return side of the second fuel rail. Excess fuel was thereafter delivered back to the fuel tank. (Later versions had the regulator and filter mounted at the in-tank pump). To support the new fuel system, the intake manifold was of a new design. Known colloquially as the \\"beer keg\\" or \\"kegger\\" manifold, the part was shaped like half of a beer barrel lying longitudinally atop the center of the V-shaped engine block. The intake runners, which supplied the fuel and air to each cylinder, fed each of the intake ports in the newly designed cylinder heads. The bolts that secured the intake manifold to the cylinder heads were installed at a different angle than those on the older LA engine; they threaded in vertically, rather than at the 45-degree angle of the 1966-up LA. Air was provided from the air filter intake to the intake manifold by a Holley-designed, aluminum, twin-venturi, mechanically actuated throttle body, which was bolted atop the intake manifold. Each venturi was progressively bored and had a diameter of 50mm. To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve (initially referred to as the \\"AIS Motor\\"). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage at the side of the throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During idle these butterfly valves were closed, so a bypass port and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air. The cylinder heads were another fundamental change of the Magnum engine, being designed to meet stricter requirements in both power and emissions by increasing efficiency. These heads were cast iron units with new wedge-shaped combustion chambers and high-swirl valve shrouding. Combustion chamber design was most important in these new heads: LA engine cylinder heads were given a full-relief open-chamber design, but the Magnum was engineered with a double- quench closed-chamber type. The higher-flowing intake ports stepped up intake flow dramatically in comparison to the original LA heads, and the exhaust ports improved cylinder evacuation as well. The shape and porting of the chambers allowed for more complete atomization of the air/fuel mixture, as well as contributing to more complete combustion; these virtues allowed for much greater efficiency of the engine as a whole. The intake and exhaust valves were located at the top of each combustion chamber. The valves themselves had shorter, 5/16\\" diameter stems, to allow for the more aggressive camshaft. Intake valves had a port diameter of 1.92\\", while exhaust valves were 1.65\\". with 60cc combustion chambers. Spark plugs were located at the peak of the combustion chambers' wedge, between the exhaust ports; press-in heat shields protected them from the heat of the exhaust manifolds. Cast iron exhaust manifolds, less restrictive than units found on previous engines, were bolted to the outboard side of each head. The new cylinder heads also featured stud-mounted rocker arms, a change from the shaft-mounted LA arms. This last change was due to the different oiling system of the new engine, as described in the next paragraph. The valve covers on the Magnum have 10 bolts rather than the previous 5, for improved oil sealing. In addition, the valve covers were made of thicker steel than earlier parts, and were installed with a silicone gasket. The valvetrain was also updated, although it was still based on a single, center-block-located camshaft pushing on hydraulic lifters and pushrods, one for each rocker arm. However, the cast nodular iron camshaft was of the \\"roller\\" type, with each lobe acting upon a hydraulic lifter with a roller bearing on the bottom; this made for a quieter, cooler-running valvetrain, but also allowed for a more aggressive valve lift. Each of the lifters acted upon a steel pushrod, which were of the \\"oil-through\\" type. This was another change for the Magnum. Because the new pushrods also served to provide oil to the top of the cylinder head, the rockers were changed to the AMC-style, screw-mounted, bridged half-shaft type. The new rockers also had a higher ratio: 1.6:1 compared to 1.5:1 in the LA engine, which increased leverage on the valves. In addition, the oil boss located at the end of the cylinder head on the LA engine was left undrilled, as it was no longer needed. However, the boss itself was left in place, perhaps to cut down on casting and machining costs, and to allow the use of earlier LA heads. Engine timing was controlled by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover at the front of the engine block. The timing chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new- design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels. The ignition system was also all-new for the Magnum. Controlled by a new micro-processor- equipped Single-Board Engine Controller (SBEC, also known as the ECM, or Engine Control Module), the ignition system included a distributor mounted at the rear of the engine. A 36,000-volt ignition coil, usually located at the front right of the engine, provided electrical power to the center of the distributor cap, where a spinning rotor directed the power to each of the individual cylinders' spark plug wires. Ignition dwell, advance and retardation were electronically controlled by the SBEC. The SBEC controlled the ignition, as well as the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on \\"open- loop\\", pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began \\"closed-loop\\" operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen sensor (O2), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. The latter controlled idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also controlled the operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, transmission shifting. By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined. Emissions output was controlled by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, lowering peak combustion temperatures, the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or Positive Crankcase Ventilation system, introduced oil vapor and unburnt fuel vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine. In 1996, the OBD-II on-board diagnostics system was introduced on all passenger vehicles in the United States, as per United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation.J Haynes & B Henderson, \\"OBD-II & Electronic Engine Management Systems Techbook (Haynes Techbook)\\", Thomas Delmar Learning, Mar 2006, As such, a new engine control computer was developed for vehicles powered by Magnum engines, known as the JTEC. The new Powertrain Control Module was more complex and more intelligent, and added programming meant it could also control automatic transmission and other powertrain functions; its firmware could also be reprogrammed (\\"reflashed\\") via the same OBD-II port. With the introduction of the JTEC, the EGR system was dropped from Magnum engines. Magnum 3.9 L V6 As the 5.2 L V8 was introduced in 1992, the often-forgotten V6 version of the Magnum engine became available in the Ram pickup and the more compact Dodge Dakota. Based on the LA-series V6, the 3.9 L featured the same changes and upgrades as the other Magnum engines. The 3.9 L can be better understood by imagining a 5.2 L V8 with two cylinders removed. Power increased substantially to at 4,400 rpm and from at 3,200 rpm, as compared with the previous TBI engine. For 1994, horsepower was reduced to , mostly due to the installation of smaller-volume exhaust manifolds; torque ratings remained the same. For 1997, the 3.9 L engine's torque output was increased to , with a compression ratio of 9.1:1. Firing order was 1-6-5-4-3-2. This engine was last produced for the 2003 Dodge Dakota pickup. Starting in the 2004 model year it was entirely withdrawn from production and replaced with the 3.7 L PowerTech V6 engine. Applications: * 1992‚Äì2003 Dodge Dakota * 1992‚Äì2003 Dodge Ram Van/Dodge Ram Wagon * 1992‚Äì2001 Dodge Ram Magnum 5.2 L V8 A 5.2 L Magnum V8 as installed in a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee The Magnum 5.2 L, released in 1992, was an evolutionary development of the 'LA' engine with the same displacement. The 5.2 L was the first of the Magnum upgraded engines, followed in 1993 by the 5.9 L V8 and the 3.9 L V6. At the time of its introduction, the 5.2 L Magnum created at 4,100 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. Production of this engine lasted until 2003, when it was completely replaced by the newer 4.7 L PowerTech SOHC V8 engine.

This was based on the LA-series engine, and included the same upgrades and design features as the 5.2 L. The standard 5.9 L created at 4,000 rpm and at 3,250 rpm. It was upgraded in 1998 to at 4,000 rpm and at 3,250 rpm. However, Chrysler came out with the performance-oriented R/T version in 1998. This engine was rated for and . The 5.9 L R/T came factory-installed in 1998-2001 Dodge Dakota R/T pickups and Dodge Durango R/T SUVs. It was also installed in the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 5.9, only available in 1998. The 5.9 L Magnum was available until the 2003 model year, when it was replaced with the 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine.Magnum 5.9L Although the pre-Magnum ('71-'92) and Magnum versions of the are both externally balanced, the two are balanced differently (the 360 Magnum uses lighter pistons) and each requires a uniquely balanced damper, flywheel, drive plate, or torque converter.

This was to be Chrysler's first 10-cylinder engine (before the '92 Viper, see below), and can best be understood as a 5.9 L V8 with two cylinders added. This engine was based on a cast iron block, and was rated for at 4,100 rpm and at 2,400 rpm. Bore and stroke was ; compression ratio was 8.4:1; firing order was 1-10-9-4-3-6-5-8-7-2. Valve covers were die cast magnesium (AZ91D alloy), rather than stamped steel; this lowered noise levels and made for better gasket sealing. The 8.0 L Magnum V10 first became available in the 1994 model year Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 pickups, and it was the most powerful gasoline-burning engine then available in any passenger pickup truck. The engine lasted through the 2003 model year, after which it was discontinued. Applications: * 1994-2003 Dodge Ram 2500/3500 Pickup Magnums today Chrysler offers a line of crate engines based on the Magnum designed to bolt into older muscle cars and street rods with little modification. Some of the changes to facilitate this were using a 1970-93 water pump so that older pulleys and brackets could be used, as well as an intake manifold that uses a carburetor instead of electronic fuel injection. With a high lift cam and single plane intake, the crate Magnum was rated at with the Magnum heads. Later models equipped with \\"R/T\\" or aluminum cylinder heads produced . A bolt- in fuel injection conversion kit is also available. Identifying a Magnum engine The easiest way to differentiate a bare Magnum block from a LA is by checking for the presence of the two crankshaft position sensor mounting bosses on the right rear top of the block, just to the rear of the cylinder head deck surface. Bosses = Magnum. All Magnum engines were stamped with a unique engine ID number. This was located on a flat impression on the cylinder block's right side, near the oil pan gasket surface. From 1992 to 1998, the ID was 19 digits long. An example would be: 4M5.2LT042312345678 -The \\"4\\" is the last digit of the model year of the engine. This example is a 1994. -The \\"M\\" stands for \\"Mound Road\\", the plant where the engine was assembled. Other characters found here would be \\"S\\" for Saltillo, \\"T\\" for Trenton and \\"K\\" for Toluca. -5.2L has an obvious meaning here: the displacement of the engine in liters. -The seventh character, here a \\"T\\", was the usage of the engine. \\"T\\" translates to truck usage. -0423 would mean the engine was produced on April 23. -The final eight digits, here shown as \\"12345678\\" are the serial number of the engine. From 1998 to 2003, the engine ID was shortened to only 13 characters. It differed in that engine displacement was given in cubic inches rather than in liters, the usage character was dropped and the serial number was four instead of eight digits long. To add some confusion, not only was the name Magnum used on Dodge passcar hi-po engines 1967-1970s, and vehicle lines in the late 1970s and 2000s, it was also applied to the 5.7L \\"Hemi\\" V8 in pickup trucks (2003+).

All Macs prior to the iMac, the iBook, the Blue and White Power Mac G3 and the Bronze Keyboard (Lombard) PowerBook G3 use Old World ROM, while said models, as well as all subsequent models until the introduction of the Intel-based EFI Models, are New World ROM machines. In particular, the Beige Power Mac G3 and all other beige and platinum-colored Power Macs are Old World ROM machines. In common use, the \\"Old World\\" designation usually applies to the early generations of PCI-based \\"beige\\" Power Macs (and sometimes the first NuBus-equipped models), but not the older Motorola 68000-based Macs; however, the Toolbox runs the same way on all three types of machines. Details PCI Power Macs with an Old World ROM contain an Open Firmware implementation, and a copy of the Macintosh Toolbox as an Open Firmware device. These machines are set to boot from this device by default, thus starting the normal Macintosh startup procedure. This can be changed, just as on New World ROM Macs, but with limitations placed on what devices and formats can be used; on these machines, particularly the early machines like the Power Macintosh 9500, the Open Firmware implementation was just enough to enumerate PCI devices and load the Toolbox ROM, and these Open Firmware revisions have several bugs which must be worked around by boot loaders or nvramrc patches. The Open Firmware environment can be entered by holding the key combination while booting. All Power Macs emulate a 68LC040 CPU inside a nanokernel; this emulator is then used to boot the predominantly 68k-based Toolbox, and is also used to support applications written for the 68k processor. Once Toolbox is running, PPC machines can boot into Mac OS directly. On all Old World ROM machines, once Toolbox is loaded, the boot procedure is the same. Toolbox executes a memory test, enumerates Mac OS devices it knows about (this varies from model to model), and either starts the on-board video (if present) or the option ROM on a NuBus or PCI video card. Toolbox then checks for a disk in the floppy drive, and scans all SCSI buses for a disk with a valid System Folder, giving preference to whatever disk is set as the startup disk in the parameter RAM. If a bootable disk is found, the Happy Mac logo is displayed, and control is handed over to the Mac OS. If no disk to boot from is present, an icon depicting a floppy disk with a blinking question mark in the middle will be displayed. If a hardware problem occurs during the early part of the boot process, the machine will display the Sad Mac icon with a hexadecimal error code and freeze; on Macs made after 1987, this will be accompanied by the Chimes of Death sound. Since the Old World ROM usually boots to Toolbox, most OSs have to be installed using a boot loader from inside Mac OS (BootX is commonly used for Linux installations). 68K-based Macs and NuBus Power Macs must have Mac OS installed to load another OS (even A/UX, which was an Apple product), usually with virtual memory turned off. PCI Power Macs can be configured to boot into Open Firmware, allowing the firmware to load a boot loader directly, or they can use a specially-prepared floppy disk to trick the Toolbox into loading a kernel (this is used for Linux installation floppy images). The simplest way to identify an Old World ROM Mac is that it will not have a factory built-in USB port. Only New World ROM Macs featured a USB port as factory equipment.

Introduced in 1959, it was known within Chrysler as the G-engine. It was a clean-sheet design that began production in 1959 at and ended in 2000 at . Design The Chrysler Slant-6 engine was a clean-sheet design, led by Willem Weertman, later Chrysler's chief engine designer. Its characteristic 30¬∞ inclination of cylinder block gives it a lower height overall engine package. This 30¬∞ inclination had already been used by Mercedes-Benz in their 300SL sports car with L6 engine since 1952. This enabled vehicle stylists to lower hoodlines, and also made room for the water pump to be mounted with a lateral offset, significantly shortening the engine's overall length. The slanted cylinder block also provides space in the vehicle's engine bay for intake and exhaust manifolds with runners of longer and more nearly equal length compared to the rake- or log-style manifolds typical of other inline engines. The No. 1 and No. 6 intake runners are of approximately equal length, the No. 2 and No. 5 equal but shorter, and the No. 3 and No. 4 equal and shortest. This has the effect of broadening the torque curve for better performance. The Slant-6 manifold configuration gives relatively even distribution of fuel mixture to all cylinders, and presents less flow restriction. This, in turn, provides for relatively good airflow through the engine despite the intake and exhaust ports being on the same side of the head rather than in a crossflow arrangement. It was introduced in two piston displacement sizes in 1960: The \\"LG\\" (low-G, referring to the relatively short engine block casting and crankshaft stroke) in the Valiant, and the \\"RG\\" (raised-G, referring to the relatively tall engine block casting and crankshaft stroke) in full-size Plymouth and Dodge Dart models. In 1960, the engine was called the \\"30-D Economy Six\\" engine by Plymouth marketers, referring to the 30¬∞ cylinder block angle. The G-engine was offered in various configurations in the North American market until 1983 in cars, 1987 in trucks, and 1991 for marine, agricultural, and industrial use. Replacement engines were built in Mexico through 2000. The G-engine was used by Chrysler's international operations in locally produced vehicles. It was also purchased by other original equipment manufacturers for installation in commercial vehicles, agricultural and industrial equipment, and boats. The G-engine gained a reputation for reliability and durability. The basic design is rigid and sturdy, in part because the engine was designed to be made of either iron or aluminum. An aluminum block was produced in 1961‚Äì1963, but most blocks were made of iron. The block is of a deep-skirt design, with the crankshaft axis well above the oil pan rails for structural rigidity. Although only four main bearings are used, they are of the same dimensions as those in the 2G (1964‚Äì1971) Hemi, and fewer mains results in a crankshaft better able to withstand the effects of torque. Efficient cooling and lubrication systems, a favorable ratio of connecting rod length to stroke, and a forged steel crankshaft (on engines made through mid-1976) all contributed to the engine's strength and durability. The G-engine gave better performance than its competitors at its 1960 introduction, and generally kept up through the 1960s and early-1970s, though engines like the Pontiac OHC Six, a brief GM outlier, bested the performance of most versions of the Slant-6. After an early factory racing program was discontinued by 1962, the Slant-6 did not receive much performance development. Most Slant-6s were equipped with a single 1-barrel carburetor. Starting in the early 1970s, primitive emission controls adversely affected driveability and power, though a version of the 2-barrel carburetor package first released for marine and export markets in 1967 was offered in North America from 1977 to 1983 under the \\"Super Six\\" name. Performance figures were only slightly higher, but driveability was substantially improved. Other Chrysler engines were released with more advanced combustion chambers, electronic fuel injection, and other modern improvements, but the length of the Slant-6 precluded its use in Chrysler's front-wheel-drive cars. A new V6 engine was created for the 1987 Dodge Dakota compact pickup truck by removing two cylinders from the corporate LA V8 engine. It replaced the Slant-6 in the rest of the Dodge truck line at the end of the 1987 model year. Significant production changes * The combustion chamber shape was slightly modified for 1967 to promote more complete combustion and reduce exhaust emission toxicity. * All G engines used forged steel crankshafts until the middle of model year 1976, when a less costly cast-iron crankshaft was introduced. The cast crankshaft uses a different block, different main and connecting rod bearings and different connecting rods. * The counterbore in the rear flange of the crankshaft was a diameter until 1967. For 1968, it was enlarged to . This difference has implications when swapping engines with automatic transmissions. * All G-engines used solid valve lifters through the 1980 model year, with the exception of a small production test of hydraulic lifters in the 1978 model year. For model year 1981, all North American G-engines received top-fed hydraulic lifters. Retrofitment in both directions is possible. * Emission control devices and systems, carburetor make and specification, and engine assembly details changed over the years to comply with market requirements and preferences. * Electronic ignition, which had been made available on V8 engines late in 1971, was made standard equipment on all engines including the RG in 1973. * Induction-hardened exhaust valve seats and upgraded exhaust valves were made standard in 1973 to withstand prolonged operation on no-lead fuel. Configuration variants =170= The 170 engine was offered in model years 1960 through 1969 in North America, and through 1971 for export markets. The first vehicle to offer the 170 slant-6 was the 1960 Valiant. The engine has a bore of and a stroke of for an actual displacement of . Connecting rod length is . The \\"LG\\" low-deck block was unique to the 170 engine. =198= The 198 was introduced in the North American market for model year 1970 as a more powerful base-model engine than the previous 170 engine. The increased displacement gave improved vehicle performance and lower manufacturing cost, for it was achieved with the tall RG block also used with the 225 engine by installing a crankshaft with stroke and connecting rods long, for an actual displacement of . Manufacturing costs were reduced by eliminating using two different blocks for the two different available sizes of slant-6 engine. The 198 engine was available through the 1974 model year. =225= Slant-6 in a Dodge Challenger The 225 used the RG (tall) block with a bore, a stroke and connecting rods, for an actual displacement of . This undersquare geometry was a departure from the emerging trend towards oversquare engines. It provided strong low-rpm torque characteristics for automobiles and trucks, as well as other commercial and marine applications. The 225 was originally designed and introduced in 1960 for use in full-size models, and it eventually became the best known of the Slant Six engines. Aluminum block 225 Between late model year 1961 and early model year 1963, approximately 52,000 die-cast aluminum RG blocks were produced and installed in passenger cars. These open-deck blocks used integrally cast high-nickel iron cylinder liners, and bolt-in iron upper and lower main bearing caps. Internal components (crank, rods, pistons, etc.) were the same as used in the iron engine, and an iron cylinder head was used with a special copper-asbestos gasket. The aluminum block weighs about less than the iron RG block. Although serviceable examples can still be found, the aluminum RG tended to undergo delamination between the iron cylinder liner and the surrounding aluminum. Severe corrosion within the block is also commonly found because of the general tendency in the 1960s and 1970s to fill cooling systems in summer with plain water without corrosion inhibitors. Moreover, the open- deck design and primitive head gasket technology are not sufficiently robust to withstand the increased seal demands of increased compression or forced induction. =High-performance variants= Most G-engines were equipped with small-capacity carburetors (such as the ubiquitous Holley 1920) and exhaust systems adequate for standard passenger car usage at low altitudes, but which tended to hamper maximum available performance at high altitudes, in heavy or race-purpose vehicles and/or where quicker acceleration was desired. To meet the demand for improved responsiveness, modified engine configurations were made available in various markets over the years. Hyper Pak Reproduction Hyper-Pak intake on a Slant-6 engine The Hyper Pak was a parts package made available from 1960 through 1962 at Chrysler Corporation dealer parts counters. The parts were made available to comply with the regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be \\"stock\\" parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept an AFB 4-barrel Carter Carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large- diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276¬∞-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual choke control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a high idle speed was required to prevent engine stall- out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. In competition events it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition. The Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high- fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s. Subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment (Clifford Research, 6=8) for inline six- cylinder engines. Multiple carburetors For the 1965‚Äì1968 model years, Chrysler Argentina equipped Valiant GT models with a system of dual 1-barrel Holley RX 7000 A carburetors and other engine specification changes. Claimed output was , compared to the single-carburetor version of the engine producing 2-barrel carburetion =Export 2-barrel setup= Air cleaner decal from Australian-market 1967‚Äì70 2bbl Slant-6 installed on US-market 1976‚Äì79 2bbl setup For the 1967 model year, a 2-barrel carburetor setup was released for export production. This configuration, similar to that found on marine G-engines beginning in 1965, consisted of an iron intake manifold with open- plenum 2-barrel carburetor mounting pad, a Carter BBD carburetor, and associated air cleaner, linkage and plumbing changes. Also installed on these export 2-barrel engines was a slightly hotter camshaft (244¬∞ duration rather than 240¬∞), and a distributor with modified advance curves. This engine, rated at , was popular in Central and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Driveability characteristics were generally superior to those of the 1-barrel engine, but to avoid cutting into sales of the more expensive V8 engine, this 2-barrel setup was not offered in the North American market. Of particular note is the automatic choke design found in this export 2-barrel setup. Most Chrysler products used remote automatic chokes, with a bimetal coil spring mounted on the exhaust manifold, exposed to exhaust heat and operating a pushrod which rotated the choke lever on the carburetor. The export 2-barrel setup used an integral heat-tube style automatic choke: Air heated by the exhaust manifold was routed to a round bakelite housing on the carburetor air horn, which contained a bimetal spring acting directly on the choke lever. =Super Six= By the mid-1970s in the North American market, emission control regulations were reducing engine performance at the same time as safety regulations were making cars heavier. An increase in performance was required for the G-engine, so a 2-barrel setup was released for the 1976 model year. This was not the same as the export 2-barrel package; the intake manifold used a throttle-bored plenum rather than an open one, and had provisions for an EGR valve. The carburetor, a Carter BBD similar but not identical to the one used on Chrysler's V8 engine, used a standard Chrysler- style remote automatic choke. A exhaust headpipe was also provided, as well as 2-barrel-specific advance curves in the ignition distributor. This package, called \\"Super Six\\" by the marketing division, brought rated horsepower from and torque from , while improving throttle response and driveability thus maintaining compliance with emission laws.

It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense, it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and perceive the world around them. Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted. With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds interact. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. Intercultural communication plays a role in social sciences such as anthropology, cultural studies, linguistics, psychology and communication studies. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills. Intercultural communication is in a way the 'interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities'.Byram, Gribkova & Starkey, 2002 Identity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity, within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society. The study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. ‚ÄúIntercultural Communication in a Globalized World.‚Äù In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A. Samovar, Richard E. Porter, and Edwin R. McDaniel, 13 edition, 45-53. Boston, Mass: Cengage Learning. Theories The following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaption, on identity negotiation and management, on communication networks,on acculturation and adjustment.Cf. Gudykunst 2003 for an overview. = Social engineering effective outcomes = *Cultural convergence **In a relatively closed social system in which communication among members is unrestricted, the system as a whole will tend to converge over time toward a state of greater cultural uniformity. The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.Kincaid, D. L. (1988). The convergence theory of intercultural communication. In Y. Y. Kim & W. B. Gudykunst (Eds.), Theories in intercultural communication (pp. 280‚Äì298). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. p.289 *Communication accommodation theory **This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances.Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction, and what social consequences result from these adjustments. *Intercultural adaption **Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means \\"the need to conform\\" to mainstream \\"objective reality\\" and \\"accepted modes of experience\\".Gudykunst, W. & Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed., 378. New York: McGraw Hill. *Co-cultural theory **In its most general form, co-cultural communication refers to interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members.Orbe, 1998. p.3 Co-cultures include but are not limited to people of color, women, people with disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and those in the lower social classes. Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors. =Identity negotiation or management= *Identity management theory *Identity negotiation *Cultural identity theory *Double-swing model = Communication networks = *Networks and outgroup communication competence *Intracultural versus intercultural networks *Networks and acculturation = Acculturation and adjustment = *Communication acculturation **This theory attempts to portray \\"cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort.\\"Kim Y.Y.(1995), p.192 *Anxiety/Uncertainty management **When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts' behaviors. *Assimilation, deviance, and alienation states **Assimilation and adaption are not permanent outcomes of the adaption process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. \\"Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication.\\"Mc.Guire and Mc.Dermott, 1988, p. 103 *Assimilation ** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices. *Alienation ** Alienation frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says: \\" alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation.\\" = Three perspectives on intercultural communication = A study on cultural and intercultural communication came up with three perspectives, which are the indigenous approach, cultural approach, and cross-cultural approach. * Indigenous approach: trying to understand the meaning of different cultures. * Cultural approach: is similar to the indigenous approach, however, the cultural approach also focuses on the sociocultural context of an individual. * Cross cultural approaches: focuses on two or more cultures to perceive cross-cultural validity and generalizability. While indigenous and cultural approaches focal point is emics, cross-cultural approaches are etics. =Other theories= * Meaning of meanings theory ‚Äì \\"A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent. A common past reduces misunderstanding. Definition, metaphor, feedforward, and Basic English are partial linguistic remedies for a lack of shared experience.\\"Griffin (2000), p. 492 * Face negotiation theory ‚Äì \\"Members of collectivistic, high-context cultures have concerns for mutual face and inclusion that lead them to manage conflict with another person by avoiding, obliging, or compromising. Because of concerns for self-face and autonomy, people from individualistic, low-context cultures manage conflict by dominating or through problem solving\\"Griffin (2000), p. 496 * Standpoint theory ‚Äì An individual's experiences, knowledge, and communication behaviors are shaped in large part by the social groups to which they belong. Individuals sometimes view things similarly, but other times have very different views in which they see the world. The ways in which they view the world are shaped by the experiences they have and through the social group they identify themselves to be a part of.Collins, P. H. (1990). Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment. Boston: Unwin Hyman. \\"Feminist standpoint theory claims that the social groups to which we belong shape what we know and how we communicate.Wood, 2005 The theory is derived from the Marxist position that economically oppressed classes can access knowledge unavailable to the socially privileged and can generate distinctive accounts, particularly knowledge about social relations.\\" * Stranger theory ‚Äì At least one of the persons in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. Strangers are a 'hyperaware' of cultural differences and tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions. * Feminist genre theory ‚Äì Evaluates communication by identifying feminist speakers and reframing their speaking qualities as models for women's liberation. * Genderlect theory ‚Äì \\"Male-female conversation is cross-cultural communication. Masculine and feminine styles of discourse are best viewed as two distinct cultural dialects rather than as inferior or superior ways of speaking. Men's report talk focuses on status and independence. Women's support talk seeks human connection.\\"Griffin (2000), p. 497 * Cultural critical studies theory ‚Äì The theory states that the mass media impose the dominant ideology on the rest of society, and the connotations of words and images are fragments of ideology that perform an unwitting service for the ruling elite. * Marxism ‚Äì aims to explain class struggle and the basis of social relations through economics.  Authentic intercultural communication  Authentic intercultural communication is possible. A theory that was found in 1984 and revisited on 1987 explains the importance of truth and intention of getting an understanding. Furthermore, if strategic intent is hidden, there can't be any authentic intercultural communication. In intercultural communication, there could be miscommunication, and the term is called \\"misfire.\\" Later on, a theory was founded that has three layers of intercultural communication. The first level is effective communication, second-level miscommunication, and third-level systemically distorted communication. It is difficult to go to the first level due to the speaker's position and the structure. History of assimilation Forced assimilation was very common in the European colonial empires the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. Voluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.  Intercultural competence  Intercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:(Lustig & Koester, 2010) Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication. *Appropriateness: Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly. *Effectiveness: Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished. Competent communication is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location. =Components= Intercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Ethnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant. People must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence. * Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful. * Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture. * Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved. * Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation. = Basic tools for improvement = The following are ways to improve communication competence: * Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person. * Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves and their perception of the world. * Empathy: Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others * Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities. * Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation. * Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort. * Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways. * Patience * Active listening * Clarity = Important factors = * Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary. * Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information. * Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures. * Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture. * Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning. = Traits = * Flexibility. * Tolerating high levels of uncertainty. * Self-reflection. * Open-mindedness. * Sensitivity. * Adaptability. * \\"Thinking outside the box\\" and lateral thinking Effective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated varies across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others. The problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended. Areas of interest = Cross-cultural business strategies = Cross- cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content. The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business. Management Important points to consider: * Develop cultural sensitivity * Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get. * Careful encoding * Use words, pictures, and gestures. * Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings. * Selective transmission * Build relationships, face-to-face if possible. * Careful decoding of feedback * Get feedback from multiple parties. * Improve listening and observation skills. * Follow-up actions Facilitation There is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment‚Äîincluding the ability to communicate within that environment. Two key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extroversion and introversion, and open-mindedness. Resilience, on the other hand, includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness. These factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of liberalism, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.  Miscommunication in a business setting  In a business environment, communication is vital, and there could be many instances where there could be miscommunication.Globalization is a significant factor in intercultural communication and affects business environments. In a business setting, it could be more difficult to communicate due to different ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Due to globalization, more employees have negative emotions in a business environment. The reason why one gets negative feelings is because of miscommunication. One study done entails the communication between non-native English speaking and native English speaking people in the United States. The study showed that, in a business environment, non-native English speakers and native English speakers had similar experiences in the workplace. Although native English speakers tried to breakdown the miscommunication, non-native English speakers were offended by the terms they used. = Cultural perceptions = There are common conceptualizations of attributes that define collectivistic and individualistic cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed. = Globalization = Globalization plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. ‚ÄúRethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.‚Äù Communication Theory 14 (1):78‚Äì83. Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers. The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization. The Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells' Praxis Model. Sorrells‚Äô process is made up of six points of entry in navigating intercultural spaces, including inquiry, framing, positioning, dialogue, reflection, and action. Inquiry, as the first step of the Intercultural Praxis Model, is an overall interest in learning about and understanding individuals with different cultural backgrounds and world-views, while challenging one's own perceptions. Framing, then, is the awareness of ‚Äúlocal and global contexts that shape intercultural interactions;‚Äù thus, the ability to shift between the micro, meso, and macro frames. Positioning is the consideration of one's place in the world compared to others, and how this position might influence both world-views and certain privileges. Dialogue is the turning point of the process during which further understanding of differences and possible tensions develops through experience and engagement with cultures outside of one's own. Next, reflection allows for one to learn through introspection the values of those differences, as well as enables action within the world ‚Äúin meaningful, effective, and responsible ways.\\" This finally leads to action, which aims to create a more conscious world by working toward social justice and peace among different cultures. As Sorrells argues, ‚ÄúIn the context of globalization, [intercultural praxis] ‚Ä¶ offers us a process of critical, reflective thinking and acting that enables us to navigate ‚Ä¶ intercultural spaces we inhabit interpersonally, communally, and globally.\\"  Interdisciplinary orientation  Cross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as cultural anthropology and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other. Cross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include anthropology, cultural studies, psychology and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by co-cultural populations, i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations. The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs. Language socialization can be broadly defined as ‚Äúan investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context‚Äù.Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer) It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant. One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication. There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations. A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.  Verbal communication  Verbal communication consists of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context. Factors that affect verbal communication: * Tone of voice * Use of descriptive words * Emphasis on certain phrases * Volume of voice The way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on. Along with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972. Example of non-verbal cues * Facial expressions * Hand gestures * Use of objects * Body movement In terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.Esposito, A. (2007). Verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours [electronic resource] : COST Action 2102 International Workshop, Vietri sul Mare, Italy, March 29‚Äì31, 2007 : revised selected and invited papers / Anna Esposito ... [et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007. Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.Scollon, R., & Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001  Nonverbal communication  Nonverbal communication refers to gestures, facial expressions, tone of voice, eye contact (or lack thereof), body language, posture, and other ways people can communicate without using language. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties. Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement‚Äîe.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries. Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication. Object language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts‚Äîe.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often. Occulesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages. Proxemics concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany. Paralanguage refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said‚Äîe.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence. Nonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.

The founder of the group was Omar Bakri Muhammad, a Syrian who previously belonged to Hizb ut-Tahrir; he was not permitted to re-enter Britain after 2005. According to The Times, the organisation has been linked to international terrorism, homophobia, and antisemitism. The group became notorious for its September 2002 conference \\"The Magnificent 19\\", praising the September 11, 2001 attacks. The network mutates periodically so as to evade the law; it operates under many different aliases. The group in its original incarnation operated openly in the United Kingdom from 14 January 1986 until the British Government announced an intention ban in August 2005. The group preemptively \\"disbanded\\" itself in 2005 to avoid this, two aliases used by the group were proscribed by the British Home Secretary under the Terrorism Act 2006; Al Ghurabaa and The Saviour Sect. Further proscriptions followed with the Terrorism Act 2000 where Islam4UK was proscribed as an Al-Muhajiroun aliashttp://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/uksi_20100034_en_1 The Proscribed Organisations (Name Changes) Order 2010 legislation.gov.uk 2010 and Muslims Against Crusades followed in 2011. More recent aliases have included Need4Khilafah and the Shariah Project, proscribed in 2014, just before prominent members, including Anjem Choudary were sent to prison (they have subsequently been released). The organisation and its activities have been condemned by larger British Muslim groups such as the Muslim Council of Britain and similar groups which represent the majority of Islam in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, Al-Muhajiroun is the most notorious of the domestic Salafi-jihadist groups and its public spokesman Anjem Choudary has significant name recognition; it is considered more radical than its initial parent organisation the Hizb ut-Tahrir, whose British-based branch does not advocate violence against the United Kingdom and thus has not been proscribed. Individual members of Al-Muhajiroun have been implicated in a number of terrorist attacks, including the murder of Lee Rigby (Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale) and the 2017 London Bridge attack (Khuram Butt). Some members, such as Zacarias Moussaoui, have been implicated in controversies surrounding Al-Qaeda. It has also operated a Lahore safe house for visiting radicals. Another member, Siddhartha Dhar, became an executioner for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Names Since they were forced to disband in 2004‚Äì2005, Al-Muhajiroun network has adopted a variety of different names to try and work around British law; each time their aliases have been subsequently proscribed under the various Terrorism Acts. Typically, the sitting Home Secretary at the time names the specific organisation as proscribed; for example in 2010, Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnston named Islam4UK in relation to the Wootton Bassett affair.bbc.co.uk: \\"Islam4UK Islamist group banned under terror laws\\", BBC, 12 January 2010 The organisation has used the following names; Al Ghurabaa (2004‚Äì2006), The Saved Sect (2005‚Äì2006), Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah (2005‚Äì2009), Islam4UK (2009‚Äì2010), Muslims Against Crusades (2010‚Äì2011) and since then Need4Khilafah, the Shariah Project and the Islamic Dawah Association.bbc.co.uk: \\"Ministers ban suspected aliases of banned extremist group\\", BBC, 26 June 2014 History =Origins in Hizb ut-Tahrir: 1983‚Äì1996= The network originated in the Middle East, as a result of the life and works of Omar Bakri Muhammad.Police raid Islamic group BBC News 30 July 2003 accessed 2 March 2016 Born in Aleppo, Syria to a wealthy Sunni family, during his youth the state was taken over by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party ‚Äì Syria Region; an organisation which promoted Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, rather than an Islamic outlook for the country. Although nominally secular, many of the ruling Ba'athists were drawn from the Alawite (Shia) minority; including Hafez al-Assad, who became President of Syria in 1971; despite Syria being a majority Sunni country. Some of the religiously inclined Syrian Sunnis, including Omar Bakri, joined the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria (up to 40,000 Muslim Brothers died in the 1982 Hama massacre, though Omar Bakri himself did not take part in the rising). Omar Bakri lived for sometime in Beirut, Lebanon and then Cairo, Egypt. He continued to join a number of Islamist organisations while studying, including joining the Hizb ut-Tahrir while in Beirut (the founder of the organisation, Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, had died in Lebanon in 1977). Omar Bakri moved to Saudi Arabia to study at the Umm al-Qura University in Mecca and the Islamic University of Madinah.Essential Fiqh, Bakri (London: The Islamic Book Company, 1996), p. 3 In the Kingdom, Hizb ut-Tahrir was a banned organisation. According to Omar Bakri's account of events, the nearest branch based in Kuwait would not allow him to create a branch in Saudi Arabia and suspended him from the organisation, despite the fact that, by 1983, he had gathered some 38 followers who endorsed creating a Saudi Arabia-based branch. Subsequently, at Jeddah, he created his own group called Al-Muhajiroun on 3 March 1983, \\"the 59th anniversary of the destruction of the Ottoman Caliphate.\\" Sadek Hamid, a scholar of Islamic politics, has claimed that this was just a front for Hizb ut-Tahrir. While living in Saudi Arabia he worked for Eastern Electric owned by Shamsan and Abdul-Aziz as-Suhaybi in Riyadh, and then Bakri moved to its Jeddah branch. Al-Mahajiroun was banned in Saudi Arabia in January 1986 and Omar Bakhri was subsequently arrested in Jeddah, but fled to the United Kingdom while released on bail. After spending some time in the United States to study, he returned to Britain where he became head of Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain.Hizb ut-Tahreer, Dr. Abdur Rahman Dimishqia, (Istanbul: Maktabah ul-Ghurabaa', 1417 AH/1997 CE) =Al-Muhajiroun in Britain: 1996‚Äì2004= Bakri's involvement in Hizb ut-Tahrir ended on 16 January 1996 when he was dismissed by the group's global leadership; following this he reinstated Al-Muhajiroun in early 1996. In the eyes of the Middle Eastern leadership of Hizb ut-Tahrir, Omar Bakri had become a liability to their organisation due to various extravagant statements he had made; justifying the assassination of Prime Minister John Major, stating that Queen Elizabeth II would convert to Islam and telling Bosniaks to reject American food aid during the Yugoslav Wars and to \\"eat Serbs\\" instead. Omar Bakri Muhammad and his group was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary entitled the Tottenham Ayatollah in 1997, in which Jon Ronson, an investigative journalist of Jewish-background followed Omar Bakri and Al-Muhajiroun around for a year. A young Anjem Choudary also featured as the group's Deputy. The documentary mentions mainstream Muslim groups (who felt that their activities were leading to a demonisation of all Muslims), Conservative MP Rupert Allason, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and even Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt criticising the group. The sitting Foreign Secretary in the Conservative Party government; Malcolm Rifkind; responded to international concerns by saying as Al-Muhajiroun had not broken any specific laws they could not be prosecuted. Omar Bakri openly discussed living on Jobseeker's Allowance and the group publicly protested in favour of the Sharia, against homosexuality and other aspects in contemporary British society that it considered to be immoral. The group claimed that they were collecting donations for groups in conflict with the State of Israel, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, but none of these groups have ever confirmed connections or if any money came to them. Yotam Feldner of the Middle East Media Research Institute, a pro-Israeli group, cites reports from Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly in November 1998, whereby Omar Bakri is alleged to have presented himself as a spokesman for Osama bin Laden's \\"International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders.\\" Finsbury Park Mosque in Islington, under Abu Hamza from 1997 until 2003, was an important centre for Al-Muhajiroun. The Mosque has since been reopened under unaffiliated authorities. During the 1990s, a number of radical Islamists who were wanted by the authorities in a number of Middle Eastern countries sought refuge in the United Kingdom, particularly London, leading some such as the French intelligence services to ridicule the situation as \\"Londonistan\\". Particularly close to Al-Muhajiroun was the Egyptian Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was the imam of Finsbury Park Mosque from 1997 until 2003 (since that time the mosque has been reopened under new authorities who are not affiliated to these tendencies). Abu Hamza had previously been an adviser to the Algerian Armed Islamic Group and had his own group called \\"Supporters of Shariah\\" which held joint protests with Al-Muhajiroun. Abu Qatada; who was associated with the Jordanian group Jaysh Mohammad and would later write sympathetically about the activities of Osama bin Laden; spoke at a Al- Muhajiroun meeting in November 1999 to raise funds for mujahideen fighters in Chechnya (as part of the Second Chechen War). Contacts were also maintained between Omar Bakri's group and other London exiles who spoke at Al-Muhajiroun gatherings; Yassir al-Sirri of Vanguards of Conquest and Mohammad al-Massari of Hizb ut-Tahrir.Al-Muhajiroun The portal for Britain‚Äôs suicide terrorists In the first two years of its new existence, the group did not advocate violence against the United Kingdom; Omar Bakri claimed in London-newspaper Asharq Al- Awsat, this was because he had a \\"covenant of peace\\" with the British government when they granted him asylum (though while still part of Hizb ut- Tahrir, Omar Bakri had earlier made comments in 1991 about a potential assassination of Prime Minister John Major, during the Gulf War). In the early days of New Labour, Home Secretary Jack Straw even appointed Al-Muhajiroun activist Makbool Javaid (brother-in-law of future Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan) to a newly formed Race Relations Forum. This situation changed in September 1998, as seven members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, including Hani al-Sibai, Sayyed Ajami and Sayyed Ahmed Abdel-Maqssuod, were arrested by the Metropolitan Police's Special Branch as part of Operation Challenge for alleged violations of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989. This was in the aftermath of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, a joint operation by Egyptian Islamic Jihad and Al-Qaeda (the two would merge in 2001), killing 224 people. The \\"Londonistan\\" situation, as it was known, had long being criticised by some of the leading Arab world governments such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and others, who regarded the groups as a threat to their national security also. After the arrests, Omar Bakri described Britain in Al-Ahram Weekly as \\"the spearhead of blasphemy that seeks to overthrow Muslims and the Islamic caliphate\\" and claimed that the seven men had been \\"lulled and betrayed into believing they could seek sanctuary in Britain from their corrupt regimes\\", claiming that Britain was motivated by a desire for \\"future economic favours\\" from the likes of Saudi Arabia. Six months after the arrests, Al-Muhajiroun and others staged a demonstration in front of 10 Downing Street to protest the continued incarceration of the seven men and they, including al-Sibai were eventually released.al-Sharq al-Awsat, \\"Islamic fundamentalist groups planning 12 March Downing St. Protest\\", 5 March 1999 Tony Blair, who was the Labour Party's Prime Minister at the time of the arrests, two decades later in 2017 accused al-Sibai of having radicalised members of the so-called \\"Beatles\\" group of ISIS militants, including \\"Jihadi John\\" (Mohammed Emwazi) and El Shafee Elsheikh. In 1998, the so-called \\"Aden Ten\\" (including eight British citizens) were arrested, while plotting attacks in Yemen. Omar Bakri boasted of connections, but the men were more directly inspired by Abu Hamza and his idea of Yemen as a starting point for an \\"Islamic Revolution.\\" Two years later in 2000, the first British-born suicide bomber Mohammed Bilal Ahmed of Birmingham, blew himself up at an Indian Army barracks in Jammu and Kashmir, killing nine people. Omar Bakri described Ahmed as a student of his. Domestically, on university campuses, Britain's National Union of Students banned Al-Muhajiroun in March 2001 after complaints were made about literature promoted by the group (particularly pertaining to Jews) and the advertisement of militant camps; Manchester University and the University of Birmingham were flashpoints for this.UK Islamic Group, Banned from Campus, Claims Misrepresentation CNS News Mike Wendling  21 September 2001 On an international level, closer attention was placed on Islamist groups following the September 11, 2001 attacks carried out by Al-Qaeda against the United States and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan which followed to overthrow the Taliban-government which was hosting Al-Qaeda (the United Kingdom under Blair's leadership joined as part of the ISAF). In the immediate aftermath of the start of the War in Afghanistan, Al-Muhajiroun spokesman Abdul Rahman Saleem (born Rahman Yahyaei) made statements proclaiming that terrorist attacks against government targets in Britain and even killing the Prime Minister would be legitimate acts. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Al-Muhajiroun mostly focused on what they claimed was the injustice of the subsequent invasion of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and often held meetings where the flag of the Taliban; a white flag with the shahada in black; was displayed. According to a report Hope not Hate, a self-described anti-fascist group closely linked to the British Labour Party, Omar Bakri bragged of connections between Al-Muhajiroun and the so-called \\"Tipton Three\\" (Ruhal Ahmed, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul), who were arrested in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Richard Reid the so-called \\"Shoe Bomber\\" during the failed 2001 shoe bomb attempt was radicalised at the AM-linked Finsbury Park Mosque. Aftab Manzoor, Afzal Munir and Mohamed Omar who died in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and the Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had AM- connections. Indeed, Al-Muhajiroun maintained a safehouse in Lahore for visiting radicals fighting for the Taliban. The most explicit connection between AM and the 9/11 attacks itself was Zacarias Moussaoui who was radicalised by the group in Brixton during the 1990s; Moussaoui pled guilty to conspiring to carry out the attacks, but was in prison in Minnesota at the time that they were carried out (he was subsequently incarcerated at ADX Florence). On 11 September 2002, Abu Hamza along with Al-Muhajiroun held a conference which came to be known as the \\"Magnificent 19\\" meeting (a term referring to the hijackers). Promoted as the launching of the \\"Islamic Council of Britain\\" (a name chosen deliberately to cause public confusion with the mainstream Muslim Council of Britain), supposedly to advocate for sharia law, the conference at Finsbury Park Mosque was entitled \\"September the 11th 2001: A Towering Day in History\\" and posters, showing an image of planes crashing into the World Trade Center were put up in Stepney, Blackburn and Birmingham. Omar Bakri said that attendees \\"look at September 11 like a battle, as a great achievement by the mujahideen against the evil superpower. I never praised September 11 after it happened but now I can see why they did it\\" and described Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda as \\"sincere [and] devoted people who stood firm against the invasion of a Muslim country.\\" Anjem Choudary, Omar Bakri's deputy and a spokesman for Al-Muhajiroun also attended. =\\"Disbandment\\", early aliases: 2004‚Äì2009= The \\"UK Poison Cell\\", which Al- Muhajiroun associate Bourgass was convicted for, was mentioned by Colin Powell in his presentation to the United Nations, endorsing the Iraq War. In early 2002, the Metropolitan Police made a number of arrests in regards to the Wood Green ricin plot, an alleged Islamist bioterrorism plot using the poison ricin (derived from seeds of the castor oil plant) by immigrants of Algerian-origin against the London Underground. Later the same month, during a raid on a flat in Crumpsall, north Manchester, DC Stephen Oake was murdered with a kitchen knife by Kamel Bourgass, an illegal immigrant from Algeria. Bourgass also stabbed three other members of Greater Manchester Police. He was wanted in connection to the Wood Green ricin plot, but was not immediately recognised. Bourgass had attended meetings of Al-Muhajiroun leading up to the incident and in the aftermath, six days later Finsbury Park Mosque was raided. The nature of the plot itself was controversial, no purified ricin was found, though notes and castor oil seeds were and most of the people arrested were eventually released. The only person ultimately convicted in court in 2005 in relation to the ricin plot was Bourgass, this was largely due to having notes in his possession on how to make ricin, cyanide and botulinum. Nevertheless, Colin Powell in his February 2003 presentation to the United Nations, arguing for commissioning the Iraq War based on alleged connections between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, made reference to a \\"UK Poison Cell\\" as part of an international network. Two brothers from Manchester, Adeel Shahid and Sajeel Shahid opened a branch of Al-Muhajiroun in Pakistan and ran a \\"safehouse\\" in Lahore for Islamists from the West (including the United Kingdom) to back the Taliban and Al-Qaeda against ISAF forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. One of the more notable individuals whom Omar Bakri and Sajeel Shahid enabled to travel to Pakistan was Mohammed Junaid Babar, who intended to go to Peshawar, but ended up in Lahore. While in Pakistan, Mohammed Junaid Babar came into contact with Mohammad Sidique Khan who would later plan the 7 July 2005 London bombings. These activities of the organisation in Pakistan were controversial to the government there, due to Islamists hostility to sitting President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf. A speaker at one of the same meetings as Sajeel Shahid was former Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, who had previously been involved in a coup against the government of Pakistan. Back in Britain, things came to a head for Al-Muhajiroun in March 2004, with the launching of Operation Crevice by the Metropolitan Police. A number of the men arrested and later convicted (Omar Khyam, Salahuddin Amin, Jawad Akbar, Anthony Garcia and Waheed Mahmood) had associations with Al-Muhajiroun; 1300 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertiliser was also recovered and the men, mostly of Pakistani-origin, were accused of planning bombing attacks on shopping centres, night clubs and gas works in Britain. Mohammed Junaid Babar testified as a witness against his former associates. Al Muhajiroun disbanded on 13 October 2004telegraph.co.uk: \\"Muslims in police will rise up, Bakri insists\\", 21 January 2007 to avoid proscription. However, it was believed that The Saviour Sect was to all intents and purposes Al Muhajiroun operating under a new name. Shortly after the 7 July 2005 London bombings Tony Blair announced the group would be banned as part of a series of measures against condoning or glorifying terrorism. Just days after the 7 July 2005 London bombings the Oxford-based Malaysian jurist, Shaykh Muhammad Afifi al-Akiti, issued his landmark fatwa against suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians, titled Defending the Transgressed, by Censuring the Reckless against the Killing of Civilians, which was written in response to this controversial \\"Magnificent 19\\" statement made by Al-Muhajiroun.Defending the Transgressed (2005), p. 17. Home Secretary Charles Clarke banned Omar Bakri Muhammad from the United Kingdom on 12 August 2005 on the grounds that his presence was \\"not conducive to the public good.\\"Islamists Down Under Assyrian International News Agency 2006-04-24Extremist Islamist groups to be banned under new terror laws Guardian Online  2010 January 11'Preacher of hate' is banned from Britain Times Online Two other offshoot organisations, The Saviour Sect and Al- Ghurabaa had previously been banned for the 'glorification' of terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2006. =Islam4UK and Wootton Bassett: 2009‚Äì2010= Anjem Choudary. The group was then relaunched in 2009 under the alias \\"Islam4UK\\", described itself as having \\"been established by sincere Muslims as a platform to propagate the supreme Islamic ideology within the United Kingdom as a divine alternative to man-made law\\" to \\"convince the British public about the superiority of Islam, thereby changing public opinion in favour of Islam in order to transfer the authority and power to the Muslims in order to implement the Sharia (in Britain)\\".Islam4UK, \\"About Us\\" It was led by Anjem Choudary. A demonstration it made against returning British soldiers in Luton gained media attention and led to the formation of the English Defence League (EDL). On 16 October 2009, members of the organisation protested against the visit to Britain by Dutch MP Geert Wilders. They carried banners with slogans such as \\"Shariah is the solution, freedom go to hell\\" and \\"Geert Wilders deserves Islamic punishment\\".Mirror.co.uk, \\"Protesters greet Dutch far-right MP\\" In January 2010 the group gained widespread media attention by announcing plans to hold a protest march through Wootton Bassett; an English town where unofficial public mourning takes place for corteges of armed forces personnel killed on active service, as they make their way from RAF Lyneham to Oxford. Reports that the group planned to carry empty coffins to \\"represent the thousands of Muslims who have died\\" were denied by the group, although the empty coffins had been proposed by Choudary himself. Choudary said that the event would be peaceful, and that it was not timed to coincide with any mourning processions. The announcement was condemned by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who said that plans for the march were \\"disgusting\\" and that \\"to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be completely inappropriate\\". The Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, indicated he would agree to any request from the Wiltshire Police or local government to ban the march under Section 13 of the Public Order Act 1986. Choudary said he chose Wootton Bassett to attract maximum attention and, he asserted, 500 members of Islam4UK would carry 'symbolic coffins' in memory of the Muslim civilians 'murdered by merciless' coalition forces. The Muslim Council of Britain stated that it \\"condemns the call by...Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett\\", and continues, \\"Like other Britons, Muslims are not opposed to Britain‚Äôs Armed Forces.\\" The Wiltshire Islamic Cultural Centre stated \\"We, along with all other Muslim community groups in Wiltshire and the surrounding area, including Bath Islamic Society and Swindon Thamesdown Islamic Association, unreservedly condemn this march,\\" adding, \\"Therefore we are putting the record straight and letting the media and general public know that the vast majority of Muslims have nothing to do with this group\\", and asking that Wiltshire Police ban the march. They stated that they, along with Call to Islam Centre and Masjid Al- Ghurabah, would counter-demonstrate against \\"Islam4UK/Al-Muhajiroon\\". On 10 January 2010 Islam4UK said it was cancelling its planned march in Wootton Bassett; however, the police had not actually received a request for permission for the march. Islam4UK was listed as an alias of Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect, already proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2004, by an order on 14 January 2010. In announcing the proscription, the then British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said: \\"It is already proscribed under two other names ‚Äì Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect\\".http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/uksi_20100034_en_1The Proscribed Organisations (Name Changes) Order 2010.

In the January 2010 order and a November 2011 order, the names Al Muhajiroun, Call to Submission, Islamic Path, London School of Sharia and Muslims Against Crusades were also listed as aliases. In June 2014, Need4Khilafah, the Shariah Project and the Islamic Dawah Association were added to the list. Note that the order is not needed to establish an alias as identical to another name of a proscribed organization, it is enough that the two are to all intents and purposes the same, and that the individual prosecuted has performed a proscribed act. Islam4UK issued a statement saying, \\"Today's ban is another nail in the coffin of capitalism and another sign of the revival of Islam and Muslims.\\" They restated their goal: \\"Therefore, we will one day liberate our land from occupation and implement the Shariah not just in Muslim countries but also right here in Great Britain. This is something that we believe in, live by and hope that in our lifetime we will witness\\". In a further statement, issued on the same day via their website, they stated that \\"Islam4UK has been contacted by authorities to (force) shut down its operations, we stress this domain name will no longer be used by us, but the struggle for Khilafah (aka \\"the Caliphate\\") will continue regardless of what the disbelievers plot against the Muslims.

Deborah Orr has commented in The Guardian that the ban \\"erodes democratic rights with the intention of defending them\\". =Muslims Against Crusades: 2010‚Äì2011= The network re-emerged as Muslims Against Crusades (abbreviated MAC), notionally under Abu Assadullah in 2010, featuring members of Islam4UK after their banning such as boxer Anthony Small and Anjem Choudary. Muslims Against Crusades maintained that Muslims are not \\"obliged to obey the law of the land in whatever country they reside\\". In 2011 the group proposed that Muslims should set up independent emirates in select cities in the UK, operating under sharia (Islamic law) entirely outside British law. The group suggested the towns of Bradford, Dewsbury, and Tower Hamlets in the East End of London as the possible first test beds for these entities. The group has often clashed with the English Defence League. Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group from midnight on 11 November 2011, making membership or support of the group a criminal offence. The group was denounced by the Muslim Council of Britain, who described MAC as \\"a tiny, and utterly deplorable, extremist group\\". Many former MAC activists are currently active in Islamist groups known as 'Millatu Ibrahim' and the 'Tawheed Movement.' During Remembrance Day 2010, Al-Muhajroun acting under Muslims Against Crusades, courted controversy by burning poppies during the two-minute silence. MAC engaged in a number of incidents including protests outside the Royal Albert Hall and in Kensington on 11 November 2010, when two large plastic poppies were burned during the Remembrance Day silence. A 2010 Remembrance Day ceremony in London was disrupted by members of the organization, who were protesting against British Army actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. They burnt large poppies and chanted \\"British soldiers burn in hell\\" during the two-minute silence. Two of the men were arrested and charged for threatening behavior. One was convicted and fined ¬£50.\\"Man guilty of burning poppies at Armistice Day protest\\". BBC News. 7 March 2011. The same group planned to hold another protest in 2011 named Hell for Heroes, declaring that soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve to go to hell. Daily Mirror The group was banned by the Home Secretary the day before the planned protest. Throughout 2010 and 2011 there were various protests against the imprisonment of Muslims, with calls for their release; and calls for a withdrawal of non- Muslim forces from Muslim countries. There was a protest against pastor Terry Jones when he burnt a Quran (the holy book of Islam) in Florida, US on 20 March 2011. They applied to the police to stage a demonstration in London to disrupt the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011, but this was not allowed. They later cancelled their protest due to a \\"possible danger to life\\" On 2 May 2011 Osama Bin Laden, who had led the Islamist al-Qaeda organization responsible for violent attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, was killed in Pakistan by US forces. On 7 May hundreds of UK Muslims and MAC members held a rally and Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer) for him outside the US embassy in London. When protesters tried to storm the embassy there were clashes with police. Anjem Choudary, who organised the protest, warned of an attack similar to the 7 July 2005 London bombings in response to Bin Laden's death. On 30 July around 50 members of MAC and Waltham Forest Muslims marched for two hours from Leyton tube station to Walthamstow town square calling for democracy to be replaced by sharia law and chanted slogans such as 'democracy‚Äîhypocrisy', 'Sharia for UK' and 'Secularism go to hell'.WALTHAM FOREST: Extremists march through borough, Guardian Series, 30 July 2011 In August, members of Muslims Against Crusades held a demonstration denouncing the Shia denomination and \\"anti-Islamic\\" Shia regimes of Syria and Iran. To mark the tenth anniversary of 11 September attacks, around 100 men linked to the group protested outside the US embassy in London, burning US flags and chanting through megaphones. The protest could be heard by mourners in 11 September Memorial Garden nearby, where a minute's silence was being observed to mark the first aeroplane hitting the World Trade Centre in New York City. On 10 November 2011 British Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group after it planned to repeat the poppy-burning demonstration; membership of Muslims Against Crusades became illegal at midnight. On 2 December 2011 twenty people were arrested on suspicion of being members of a banned group, and two for obstruction and violent disorder at a demonstration outside the US embassy in London; the police did not confirm a report that the protesters were members of MAC. The group was ridiculed on the television program Have I Got News For You, with Ian Hislop saying \\"aren't they a couple hundred years late, these Muslims Against Crusades?\\"Have I Got News for You, series 41, episode 3 =Need4Khilafah and recent: 2011‚Äìpresent= In June 2014, the UK government banned three more groups it suspected of being aliases for the extremist organisation al-Muhajiroun: * Need4Khilafah * the Shariah Project * the Islamic Dawah Association Ideology Al-Muhajiroun's proclaimed aims are to establish public awareness about Islam, to influence public opinion in favour of the sharia, to convince members of society that Islam is inherently political and a viable ideological alternative, to unite Muslims on a global scale in the threats facing the Ummah and to resume the Islamic way of life by re-establishing the Islamic Caliphate. Members have carried out numerous murders and terrorist attacks. Their general worldview; with a heavy focus on a pan-Islamist-orientated worldwide caliphate is derived directly from its parent organisation Hizb al-Tahrir (founded by Taqiuddin al- Nabhani) as espoused by Omar Bakri Muhammad. The organisation is commonly described as Islamist and is sometimes classified as Salafist, however, some Salafists (who follow the line of Rabee al-Madkhali and other Salafists mainstream in the Arab Gulf states), consider Al-Muhajiroun and other modern \\"jihadist\\" groups which focus on politically motivated terrorism (particularly indiscriminate attacks against civilians) as modern day Kharajites, whose ideological line derives ultimately from the Muslim Brotherhood and Sayyid Qutb (supposedly influenced by non-Islamic \\"Leninist\\" ideas, these individuals, in their view \\"appropriated\\" the Salafi name for means of credibility within Islamic circles), rather than Ibn Taymiyyah. Terrorism =Statements= Aside from declaring the 9/11 hijackers \\"the Magnificent 19\\", controversial statements made by al-Muhajiroun include one warning the British government that it was \\"sitting on a box of dynamite and have only themselves to blame if after attacking the Islamic movements and the Islamic scholars, it all blows up in their face\\". In 2004 BBC Newsnight quoted one Al-Muhajiroun leader, Abu Ibrahim, as saying, > When they speak about 11 September, when the two planes magnificently run > through those buildings, OK and people turn around and say, 'hang on a > second, that is barbaric.

One former associate said Adebolajo that \\"locked himself in this room with this bloke for a few hours and when he came out he was a Muslim convert.

After Roman rule, the city was ruled by the Visigoths and Merovingian and Carolingian Franks. Capital of the County of Toulouse during the Middle Ages, today it is the capital of the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es region.  Before 118 BC: pre-Roman times  Archaeological evidence dates human settlement in Toulouse to the 8th century BC. Its location was advantageous; the Garonne River bends westward toward the Atlantic Ocean, and can be crossed easily. People settled on the hills overlooking the river, south of present downtown Toulouse. Just north of the hills is a large plain suitable for agriculture, and the site was a center for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The historical name of the city, Tolosa (Œ§ŒøŒª·ø∂œÉœÉŒ± in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), researchers agree that it was probably Aquitanian (an ancestor of the Basque language), its meaning is unknown. Toulouse's name has remained almost unchanged through the centuries (rare for a French city), despite Celtic, Roman and Germanic invasions. The first inhabitants were apparently the Aquitani, of whom little is known. Later came Iberians from the south, who (like the Aquitani) were non-Indo-Europeans. During the third century BC the Volcae Tectosages (a Gallic tribe from Belgium or southern Germany) arrived, the first Indo-Europeans in the region. They settled in Tolosa, intermarrying with the local people, and their Gaulish language became predominant. By 200 BC, Tolosa is attested on coins as the capital of the Volcae Tectosages (which Julius Caesar called Tolosates‚Äîsingular Tolosas‚Äîin his Commentarii de Bello Gallico). According to archaeologists, Tolosa was one of the wealthiest and most important cities in Gaul during the pre-Roman era. Gold and silver mines were nearby, and offerings to its shrines and temples accumulated wealth in the city. 118 BC‚ÄìAD 418: Roman period Vomitorium of the Toulouse amphitheatre The Romans began their conquest of southern Gaul (later known as the Provincia) in 125 BC. In 118 BC they founded the colony of Narbo Martius (Narbonne, the Mediterranean city nearest to inland Toulouse) and made contact with the Tolosates, noted for their wealth and the position of their capital for trade with the Atlantic. Tolosa allied with the Romans, who established a fort on the plain north of the city (a key position near the border of independent Aquitania) but otherwise left Tolosa semi-independent. In 109 BC the Germanic Cimbri tribe descended the Rh√¥ne Valley, invaded the Provincia and defeated the Romans, whose power was shaken along the recently conquered Mediterranean coast. The Tolosates rebelled against Rome, killing the Roman garrison, before Rome recovered and defeated the invaders. In 106 BC, Quintus Servilius Caepio was sent to reconquer and punish Tolosa. With the aid of Tolosates who remained loyal to Rome, he captured the city and the wealth of its temples and shrines. Tolosa was then incorporated into the Roman Provincia (Provincia Romana, the common name for the province of Transalpine Gaul with its capital at Narbo Martius). Although Tolosa was an important military garrison at the western border of the Roman empire, the city remained a backwater in the Provincia and people still lived in the old Celtic city in the hills. No Roman colony was established, and few soldiers settled in the area. After the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, Tolosa did not participate in the uprisings against Rome during the Gallic wars and southern France would be the most Romanized part of France after the decline of the Roman Empire. Caesar established his camp on the Tolosa plain in 52 BC, conquering western Aquitania. With the conquest of Aquitania and Gaul, Tolosa was no longer a military outpost. Capitalizing on its position for trade between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (both now under Roman control), the city grew rapidly. The most important event in the city's history was the decision to relocate north of the hills. A typical Roman city, with straight streets, was founded on the plain on the beginning bank of the river between the end of Augustus' reign and the beginning of Tiberius' (about 10‚Äì30 AD). The population was forced to relocate to the new city (also named Tolosa), and the old settlement was abandoned. Walls were built around the new city, probably at the initiative of Emperor Augustus (who wanted to create a major city at the junction of the newly built Via Aquitania and the Garonne); such walls, unnecessary during the Pax Romana, were built as an imperial favor to indicate a city's status. Until the fall of Rome, the new Tolosa was a civitas of the province of Gallia Narbonensis (with its capital Narbo Martius‚ÄîNarbonne‚Äîthe new name of the old provincia). With imperial favor and thriving trade, Tolosa became a major city in the Roman Empire. During the civil war following Nero's death, Tolosa native M. Antonius Primus led the armies of Vespasian into Italy, entered Rome in 69 AD and established the Flavian dynasty. Emperor Domitian, son of Vespasian and Primus' friend, granted Tolosa the honorific status of Roman colony. Another sign of imperial favor was Domitian's bestowal of the title of Palladia on the city in reference to Pallas Athena, goddess of arts and knowledge. Palladia Tolosa was a major Roman city, with aqueducts, circus and theaters, thermae, a forum and an extensive sewage system. Protected by its walls and its distance from the Rhine, it escaped unscathed from the third-century invasions. With much of Gaul destroyed, Toulouse was the fourth-largest city in the western half of the Roman Empire after Rome, Treves and Arles. Around that time, Christianity entered the city; the Christian community expanded under Saint Saturnin (locally known as Saint Sernin), the first bishop of Toulouse, who was martyred in Toulouse about 250. In 313 the Edict of Milan established religious freedom in the empire, ending persecution of the Christians, and in 403 the Saint-Sernin basilica opened as a shrine for relics of Saint Saturnin. On December 31, 406, the Rhine frontier was breached by tribes seeking to escape starvation during a harsh winter. In 407, Toulouse was besieged by the Vandals. Under its bishop, Saint Exuperius, the city resisted; the Vandals lifted the siege, moving into Spain and settling in North Africa. \\"The provinces of Aquitaine and of the Novempopulana (Gascony), of Lyon and of Narbonne are, with the exception of a few cities, one universal scene of desolation. And those which the sword spares without, famine ravages within. I cannot speak without tears of Toulouse which has been kept from failing hitherto by the merits of its reverend bishop Exuperius\\", wrote Jerome to a Roman widow in 409 (Letters cxxiii.16). In 413 (three years after they sacked Rome), the Visigoths under King Ataulf captured Toulouse; under pressure from Roman forces, they soon withdrew south of the Pyrenees. After the murder of Ataulf, his successor Wallia resolved to make peace with Rome. In exchange for peace, in 418 Emperor Honorius gave the Visigoths Aquitania and Toulouse (in Gallia Narbonensis, at the border of Aquitania). The Visigoths chose Palladia Tolosa as their capital, ending Roman rule of the city. 418‚Äì508: Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse Kingdom of the Visigoths by 500 The Visigothic kings of Toulouse, one of the foederati (allies) of the Roman Empire in the West and limited to Aquitania and Toulouse, soon began encroaching on neighboring territories. As Roman allies the Visigoths helped defeat Germanic invaders in Spain (notably the Suebi), taking advantage of their position to expand their territory south of the Pyrenees. They tried to conquer the Mediterranean coast of the province of Gallia Narbonensis, but were opposed by Rome. In 439 the Roman general Litorius defeated the Visigoths at Narbonne, driving them back to Toulouse. Although he besieged the city, he was defeated and taken prisoner. Avitus, the praetorian prefect of Gaul with influence on King Theodoric I of the Visigoths, was then sent to Toulouse and concluded a peace. In 451, threatened by an invasion of the Huns in Gaul, he negotiated a treaty between Rome and the Visigoths and they defeated the Huns. In 455 Avitus, magister militum (senior military officer of the Empire) on a diplomatic mission to King Theodoric II of the Visigoths, was proclaimed the new Roman emperor in Toulouse by his Visigothic friends amid news that the Vandals had sacked Rome and Emperor Petronius Maximus had been murdered. Avitus' reign in Rome was brief, and he was defeated by his enemies in 456. This antagonized the Visigoths, who warred with the new Roman leaders, and a weaker Rome gave way. The Narbonne region was conquered by the Visigoths in 462. King Euric (466‚Äì484), an enemy of Rome, extended the Visigothic territory in Gaul and Spain. In 475 he dissolved the treaty with Rome, proclaiming independence a year before the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Toulouse was now the capital of an expanding Gothic kingdom; by the end of the fifth century, the kingdom of Toulouse extended from the Loire Valley in the north to the Strait of Gibraltar in the south and from the Rh√¥ne in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west (the largest territory controlled from Toulouse). Battle between Clovis and the Visigoths Unlike most cities in western Europe, Toulouse remained prosperous during the Migration Period. Although the Visigoths professed Arianism (a non-Trinitarian form of Christianity) and lived apart from their Gallo-Roman subjects, they were generally well accepted for bringing protection and prosperity. Behind its first-century walls, the city encompassed the same area; most western European cities were hastily enclosing small portions of their imperial area. The treasure which the Visigoths seized in Rome in 410 (including that from the Temple in Jerusalem) was reportedly stored in Toulouse at the time. The Visigoths blended Roman and Gothic cultures, preserving Roman law in the 506 Breviary of Alaric (applying to the Visigoths and the local Roman population). The Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse was reportedly more Romanized and its state structure more elaborate than the Frankish kingdom north of the Loire Valley. Under Clovis the Franks converted to Catholicism, receiving support from bishops opposing the Visigoths' Arianism and marching south to the northern borders of the Visigothic kingdom. War followed, and the Visigothic king Alaric II was defeated by Clovis at the Battle of Vouill√© in 507. The Franks moved south, conquered Aquitania and captured Toulouse in 508. The Visigoths withdrew to Iberia, moving their capital to Toledo. Toulouse became part of Aquitaine, a smaller city in the Frankish kingdom.  508‚Äì768: Merovingian Franks and the duchy of Aquitaine  After the Frankish conquest, Toulouse began a period of decline and anarchy. Poor weather, plagues, demographic collapse and the decline of education and culture were common in the Frankish lands during the sixth and seventh centuries. Following Clovis' death in 511, Aquitaine and the rest of the kingdom were divided between his sons (the Merovingian dynasty). The Merovingian kings fought each other for control of the Frankish realm. Aquitaine was loosely controlled by Frankish kings, who delegated dukes to control the region in their name. In 680, the Duchy of Vasconia (founded 602) and Aquitaine merged under the first independent duke of Aquitaine: Felix, a Roman patrician from Toulouse. The Merovingian monarchy was weakened, and an independent local dynasty of dukes emerged in Aquitaine. Unrecognized by the Merovingians, they ruled as kings in Aquitaine (including the Basque-speaking area of Gascony south of the Garonne) with their capital Toulouse. Charles Martel's campaigns in Aquitaine, Septimania and Provence (735-742) During the early eighth century the Arabs appeared in the region from the Mediterranean coast of Spain, capturing Narbonne from the last Visigoths in 719. Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, wali (governor) of al-Andalus (Muslim Spain), mustered a strong army from North Africa, Syria and Yemen to conquer Aquitaine. Moving west from Narbonne, he besieged Toulouse. After three months, as the city was about to surrender, Duke Odo of Aquitaine (also known as Eudes)‚Äîwho had left the city to find help‚Äîreturned with an army and defeated the Arabs in the Battle of Toulouse on June 9, 721. Charles Martel refused to help, wishing to take advantage of the situation to recover Aquitaine, and Odo led an army of Aquitanians and Franks to fight the Arabs. The Battle of Toulouse was a crushing defeat for the Arabs; the army scattered, most of the soldiers were killed, al-Samh died of his wounds and the remainder of the Arab troops (under Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi) fled back to Narbonne. It is noted by Arab historians as the major check of Arab westward expansion. Before 730 Odo allied with the Muslim ruler of Catalonia, Uthman ibn Naissa (also known as Munuza). The greatest threat to Duke Odo was his Frankish neighbor in the north. Odo married his daughter to Munuza and Arab raids in Aquitaine temporarily ended, enabling him to focus on the northern threat. In 731 Munuza rebelled against the new wali of al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi. Abd al- Rahman defeated him, and to punish Odo for his alliance he launched a raid on Aquitaine. Remembering the Battle of Toulouse, he crossed the Pyrenees west the city and defeated Odo's army in Bordeaux. With Bordeaux captured, the Arabs moved north towards the sacred Frankish abbey of Tours. Odo requested Frankish help; Charles Martel, leader of the Franks, mustered an army and met the Arabs near Poitiers. On 25 October 732, at the Battle of Poitiers, the Arabs were defeated and Abd al-Rahman died on the field. The scholars of Charlemagne, grandson of Charles Martel, extensively chronicled the battle. After the Battle of Poitiers, Odo was obligated to pay homage to Charles Martel and recognize Frankish authority. The Franks were busy in Burgundy and did not move further south, leaving Odo independent until his death in 735. He was succeeded by his son, Duke Hunald I of Aquitaine (also known as Hunold and Hunaud). Hunald refused to recognize Charles Martel, who sent his troops south and captured Bordeaux in 736. Hunald was forced to accept Frankish authority, and Martel withdrew his troops from Aquitaine to attack Arab holdings on the Mediterranean coast near Narbonne. In 741 Charles Martel died and was succeeded by his son, Pippin the Short (P√©pin le Bref). Hunald again rebelled against Frankish authority the following year; after his 745 defeat, he retired to a monastery. He was succeeded by his son, Waifer of Aquitaine (also known as Waifre and Gaifier). Pippin, busy at home and sharing power with his brother, left Waifer in possession of Aquitaine and became sole ruler of the Frankish realm in 747. In 751 he deposed the last Merovingian king and was elected king of the Franks with the support of the pope, founding the Carolingian dynasty. In 752, Pippin resumed the conquest of Arab territories on the Mediterranean coast where his father had failed. Facing local resistance, including intervention by Duke Waifer, in 759 he captured Narbonne and ended Arab rule north of the Pyrenees. Aquitaine was now surrounded by the Frankish kingdom, and in 760 Pippin began its conquest. It took the Franks eight years to subdue Aquitaine, Toulouse and Gascony; in 768, the last pockets of resistance crumbled as Duke Waifer was betrayed and murdered under mysterious circumstances. Although Aquitaine was destroyed after eight years of scorched-earth tactics by Pippin and Waifer, the region would recover under Charlemagne.  768‚Äì877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine  Toulouse, Aquitaine and Gascony were again part of the Frankish kingdom. After his victory, Pippin the Short died in 768 and was succeeded by his sons Charlemagne and Carloman. At Pippin's death, Hunald (son of Duke Waifer) staged an insurrection against Frankish power in Aquitaine. Charlemagne intervened, defeating him. In 771 Carloman died, leaving Charlemagne sole ruler of the Frankish realm. In 778, Charlemagne led his army into Spain against the Arabs. On his way back, in Roncesvalles, Charlemagne's rear guard was attacked in the pass by Basque warriors. Realizing that the local populations were not entirely loyal to the Franks, he reorganized the region's administration; direct Frankish government was instituted, and Frankish counts (deputies of the Frankish king) were appointed in cities such as Toulouse. In 781 Charlemagne established the Kingdom of Aquitaine, comprising Aquitaine, Gascony and the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to N√Æmes (known as Gothia), and gave the crown of Aquitaine to his three-year-old son Louis. Similar kingdoms were established in Bavaria and Lombardy to ensure the loyalty of local populations. Crowns were also given to Charlemagne's other sons, and Aquitaine was known for its independence and wealth. Charlemagne saw that he could not trust the local nobility of Vasconia, appointing Frankish counts and creating counties (such as Fezensac) which could fight regional dukes such as Lupus. Oversight of this Basque frontier seems to have been given to Chorson, count (or duke) of Toulouse. In 787 (or 789) Chorson was captured by Odalric the Basque (probably Lupus' son), who forced him into an agreement. Charlemagne replaced him with Count William in 790. Charlemagne's reign saw the recovery of western Europe from the preceding dark age. Toulouse was a major Carolingian military stronghold against Muslim Spain, with military campaigns launched from the city nearly every year of Charlemagne's reign. In 801, Barcelona and a large part of Catalonia were conquered. With the northern areas of Aragon and Navarre in the Pyrenees, the region became the southern (Spanish March) of the Frankish empire. In 814, Charlemagne died. His only surviving son was Louis, king of Aquitaine, who became Emperor Louis the Pious. The kingdom of Aquitaine was transferred to Pippin, Louis' second son. Gothia was detached from Aquitaine and administered directly by the emperor, recreating the former duchy of Aquitaine. Louis had three sons, and in 817 he arranged an allocation of shares in their future inheritance. Pippin was confirmed king of Aquitaine, Louis the German was made king in Bavaria and eldest son Lothar became co-emperor (with future authority over his brothers). In 823 Charles the Bald, Louis the Pious' son with his second wife, was born and she wished to place her son in the line of succession. Strife between his three older sons and Louis and his new wife led to the gradual collapse of the Frankish empire. In 838 Pippin I of Aquitaine died, and Louis the Pious and his wife installed Charles the Bald as king of Aquitaine. At the 839 Assembly of Worms, the empire was re-divided. Charles the Bald received the western part of the empire, Lothar the central and eastern part and Louis the German Bavaria. Pippin II of Aquitaine, son of Pippin I who was recognized as king by the Aquitanians (but not the Basques, whose Vasconia had seceded from Aquitaine), and Louis the German opposed the partitions. Louis the Pious died in 840, Lothar claimed the empire and war broke out. Originally allied with his nephew Pippin II, Louis the German allied with his half-brother Charles the Bald and they defeated Lothar. In August 843, they signed the Treaty of Verdun. The empire was divided into three parts. Charles the Bald received the western part, Francia Occidentalis (Western Frankland, soon called France); Louis the German the eastern part, Francia Orientalis (Eastern Frankland, soon the German Holy Roman Empire), and Lothar received the central part (soon to be conquered and divided between his brothers). Family strife left the empire weak and undefended, and the Vikings took advantage of the situation. After the Treaty of Verdun, Charles the Bald moved south to defeat Pippin II and add Aquitaine to his territory. He conquered Gothia, and in 844 besieged Toulouse before withdrawing from the city. That year the Vikings entered the Garonne River, took Bordeaux and sailed as far as Toulouse, plundering and killing throughout the valley. They withdrew from Toulouse, without attacking the city. In 845 Charles the Bald signed a treaty with Pippin II of Aquitaine, recognizing Pippin as king of Aquitaine in exchange for Pippin's relinquishing of northern Aquitaine (the County of Poitiers) to Charles. The Aquitanians, now dissatisfied with Pippin, asked Charles to topple him in 848. The following year Charles received Toulouse from Fr√©delon, the count of Toulouse recently appointed by Pippin, and Charles confirmed Fr√©delon as count of Toulouse. Aquitaine soon submitted to Charles; in 852 Pippin was imprisoned by the Basques and handed over to Charles (who placed him in a monastery). In 852 Fr√©delon of Toulouse died, and Charles appointed Fr√©delon's brother Raymond the new count. This began the dynasty of the counts of Toulouse, who were descendants of Count Raymond I of Toulouse. In 855, following the example of his grandfather Charlemagne, Charles the Bald recreated the kingdom of Aquitaine (without Gothia) and gave the crown to his son Charles the Child. Pippin II of Aquitaine escaped from the monastery in 854, and unsuccessfully attempted to foment an insurrection in Aquitaine. He appealed to the Vikings for help and in 864, at the head of a Viking army, unsuccessfully besieged Toulouse. The Vikings left to plunder other areas of Aquitaine and Pippin II was captured and again placed in a monastery by his uncle, where he soon died. In 866, Charles the Child died; Charles the Bald made his other son, Louis the Stammerer, the new king of Aquitaine. By then, the central state in the kingdom of France was losing its authority. Charles was unsuccessful at containing the Vikings and local populations relied on their counts, who became the chief authorities. As their power increased, they established local dynasties. Wars began between the central authorities and the counts and between counts, which weakened defenses against the Vikings. Western Europe, France in particular, entered a new dark age which would be more disastrous than that of the sixth and seventh centuries. Charles the Bald signed the 877 Capitulary of Quierzy, allowing counts to be succeeded by their sons, before his death four months later; this formed the basis of feudalism in western Europe. He was succeeded as king of France by his son, Louis the Stammerer, king of Aquitaine. Louis did not choose any of his sons as the new king of Aquitaine, putting an end to the kingdom. He died in 879 and was succeeded by his two sons, Louis III and Carloman. Louis III inherited northwest France, and Carloman inherited Burgundy and Aquitaine. However, from 870 to 890 central power was so weak that the counts in southern France were autonomous and Paris would not reassert its authority over the south of France for four centuries.  877‚Äì10th century Toulouse in the early Middle Ages By the end of the ninth century Toulouse was the capital of the county of Toulouse, and was ruled by the independent dynasty founded by Fr√©delon. The counts of Toulouse were challenged by those of Auvergne, who ruled the northeastern part of former Aquitaine and claimed Toulouse. The counts of Toulouse survived; although the county was a small part of the former Aquitaine, at the death of Count William the Pious of Auvergne in 918 it acquired Gothia. This doubled its territory, reuniting Toulouse with the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to N√Æmes. The county of Toulouse took shape from the city in the west to the Rh√¥ne in the east, an entity which would survive until the French Revolution as the province of Languedoc. Toulouse would never again be part of Aquitaine, whose capital would become Poitiers and then Bordeaux. William the Pious was the first to recreate the title of Duke of Aquitaine for himself during the 890s, and the count of Poitiers inherited the title in 927. In 932 King Rudolph of France, fighting the count of Poitiers, conferred the title of Duke of Aquitaine to new ally Count Raymond III Pons of Toulouse. The French throne had become a nearly empty title. After Rudolph's death, a faction crowned the English-bred Carolingian prince Louis IV from Overseas. Raymond III Pons belonged to the opposing faction, and when he died in 950 Louis IV bestowed the title of Duke of Aquitaine on Louis IV ally Count William III Towhead of Poitiers. The title of Duke of Aquitaine would be held by the family of the counts of Poitiers, whose power base at Poitou was in northwestern Aquitaine. At the death of Carolingian king of France Louis V in 987 the Robertian faction had its chief, Hugh Capet, elected to the French throne; This ended the Carolingian dynasty. Hugh Capet founded the Capetian dynasty, which would rule France for the next eight centuries. The counts of Toulouse extended their domain to the Mediterranean coast, but their rule was short-lived. During the 10th century civilization, the arts and education had declined; a rebirth of culture and order during the reign of Charlemagne was smothered by Viking invasions, augmented by poor weather and plagues which contributed to population loss. Large areas of western Europe returned to wilderness, and cities were depopulated. Churches were abandoned or plundered; Christianity lost much of its moral authority, although Roman culture survived in scattered monasteries. This contrasted with the flourishing emirate of C√≥rdoba in Spain and the Byzantine Empire. Authority decentralized, falling from counts to viscounts to thousands of local feudal lords. By the end of the century, France was governed by thousands of local rulers who controlled one town or one castle and a few surrounding villages. Between 900 and 980 the counts of Toulouse gradually lost control to local dynastic rulers, and by 1000 ruled only a few scattered estates; the city was ruled by a viscount, independent of the counts. Invasions had also resumed. Emir of C√≥rdoba Abd al-Rahman III reunited Muslim Spain and brought the emirate to its zenith, transforming it into the caliphate of C√≥rdoba in 929. During the 920s, he launched an offensive against the Christian kingdoms in northern Spain. In 920 one of Abd al-Rahman's armies crossed the Pyrenees, reaching Toulouse without capturing the city. Four years later, the Magyars launched a westward expedition and reached Toulouse before their defeat by Count Raymond III Pons. By the end of the 10th century, the Carolingian wars and subsequent invasions had left the county in disarray. Land was left uncultivated, and many farms were abandoned. Toulouse's proximity to Muslim Spain gave it a flow of knowledge and culture from the schools and printing houses of C√≥rdoba, and it had retained more of the Roman legacy than northern France.  11th century Saint-√âtienne Cathedral At the beginning of the millennium, the church was co-opted by the Toulouse administration; the Saint-Sernin church, the Daurade basilica and the Saint-√âtienne cathedral were not maintained properly, and the Cluniac Reforms began. Bishop Isarn, aided by Pope Gregory VII, gave the Daurade Basilica to the Cluniac abbots in 1077. In Saint-Sernin he was opposed by Raimond Gayrard, a provost who had built a hospital for the poor and wanted to build a basilica. Supported by Count Guilhem IV, Gayrard received permission from Pope Urban II to dedicate the basilica in 1096. During this period Toulouse developed more efficient agricultural methods; the suburbs of Saint-Michel and Saint-Cyprien were built and Saint-Sernin and Saint-Pierre des Cuisines developed. The Daurade bridge, connecting Saint-Cyprien to the city, was built in 1181. 12th century The end of the 11th century marked the departure of count Raymond IV for the Crusades. Wars of succession followed, and Toulouse was besieged several times. In 1119 the city's population proclaimed Alphonse Jourdain count, and Jourdain reduced their taxes in gratitude. At his death, an administration of eight capitulaires was created. Under the direction of the count, they regulated commerce and enforced the law. The Capitouls' first acts date to 1152. In 1176 the chapitre had 12 members, each representing a district of Toulouse. The consuls opposed Count Raimond V; the city's population was divided, and in 1189 (after 10 years of fighting) the count submitted to the town council. Construction of the Capitole de Toulouse began in 1190. With 24 members, the Capitouls gave themselves the rights of law enforcement, commerce and taxation. The Capitouls gave Toulouse relative independence for nearly 600 years, until the French Revolution.  13th century Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse Catharism was a Christian movement espousing the separation of the material and the spiritual, partially inspired by the Bogomils of Bulgaria. Accused of heresy, the Cathars had a large following in the south of France; during the 12th century. Simon de Montfort tried to exterminate them. In Toulouse, the orthodox White Brotherhood pursued the heretical Black Brotherhood. The abbot of Foulques, who was in debt to the heretics, encouraged the Albigensian Crusade. The consuls, unwilling to encourage the city's division, defied the Pope and refused to identify the heretics. Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, an excommunicated Catholic, sympathised with the heretics because of the massacre at B√©ziers. Although Simon de Montfort's first siege of Toulouse in 1211 was unsuccessful, two years later he defeated the city's army. With many hostages, he entered the city in 1216 and appointed himself as count. De Montfort was killed by a stone at the Siege of Toulouse in 1218. Until the final siege, the \\"whites\\" were opposed by the city's populace and Louis VII relented in 1219. Raymond VI, recognizing his support from the population (which helped him preserve his interests), gave his last prerogatives to the Capitouls. 13th to 14th century Couvent des Jacobins de Toulouse The 1229 Treaty of Paris introduced the University of Toulouse, which aimed to teach theology and Aristotelian philosophy. Copied from the Parisian model, its curriculum was intended to combat heresy. The Dominican monastic order was founded, with its home in the Couvent des Jacobins de Toulouse. A nearly four-century inquisition (with suspected persons driven into exile or to conversion) began, centred in the city. Convicted of heresy, Count Raimond VII died in 1249 without an heir; the county passed to the King of France, and the Capitouls' power weakened. In 1321, the Jews of Toulouse were victims of a massacre during the Shepherds' Crusade, during which homes in the Jewish Quarter were ransacked and those who refused to be baptized were killed. In 1323, the Consistori del Gay Saber was established in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours. Toulouse was the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years, and the Consistori existed until 1484. The city grew richer, active in the trade of Bordeaux wine, cereals and textiles with England. In addition to the inquisition, plague, fire, flood and the Hundred Years' War decimated Toulouse. Despite immigration the city's population declined by 10,000 in 70 years, and Toulouse had a population of 22,000 in 1405. 15th to 16th century Civitas Tholosa, Nicolas Bertrand, 1515 The 15th century began with the creation of a parlement by Charles VII. Promising exemption from taxes, the king reinforced his influence and defied the Capitouls. Many food shortages occurred at this time. The roads were unreliable, and Toulouse experienced a major fire in 1463; buildings between the current rue Alsace- Lorraine and the Garonne were destroyed. The city's population increased, resulting in a housing shortage. Beginning in 1463, trade in blue dye (woad) flourished. The dye, known at the time as \\"pastel\\", triggered a period of great prosperity. Toulouse used its new wealth to build the homes and public buildings that are today the core of the old city. The city's prosperity was short-lived; woad was eclipsed by indigo from India, which produced a darker, more-colorfast blue. In the mid-16th century, the University of Toulouse had nearly 10,000 students. It was a centre of humanistic ferment, as the inquisition continued burning people at the stake. During the 1562 Riots of Toulouse, battles between Huguenots and Catholics resulted in over 3,000 deaths and the arson of 200 homes in the Saint-Georges quarter.  17th century  Tavernier's 1631 plan of the city When Henry IV acceded to the throne, disorder ended in Toulouse. The parlement recognized the King of France, the edict of Nantes was accepted in 1600 and the Capitouls lost their remaining influence they had. A threat more serious than the Fronde reached Toulouse in 1629 and 1652: plague. For the first time, the city and the local parlement cooperated to assist those affected by the epidemic. Most of the clergy and the wealthy left the city, but doctors were required to stay. Starvation led the remaining Capitouls to prevent the butchers and bakers from leaving. La Grave Hospital accommodated those affected by the epidemic, quarantining them. The Pr√© des Sept Deniers also accepted many patients under hazardous conditions. Before closing its gates, the city attracted the poor with a medical infrastructure offering more hope than the countryside. Pont- Neuf de Toulouse In 1654, when the second epidemic ended, the city was devastated. However, during plague-free periods two major projects were completed: the Pont-Neuf in 1632 and the Canal du Midi in 1682. Famine occurred in 1693.  18th century Front of the Capitole Louis de Mondran, inspired by his stay in Paris, was the new city planner. Principal achievements of this period were the Grand Rond, the Cours Dillon, and the facade of the Capitole. In 1770, the Cardinal of Brienne laid the first stone of the channel named for him. The channel, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and the Canal du Midi to the Canal Lateral √† la Garonne, was finished six years later. Their confluence is known as Ponts-Jumeaux. Economic inequality increased, with work for local architects and sculptors. The Reynerie was the summer residence of the husband of the Comtesse du Barry. At the end of the century, the Blue Penitents worshiped at the Saint-J√©rome church. The local parlement condemned the Protestants, exercising its power in the trial and execution of Jean Calas. Toulouse's population supported the parlement when it felt threatened by the monarchy, and the eight Capitouls were now chosen by the parlement.  19th century  Toulouse and its faubourgs in 1815 Downtown Toulouse and the Garonne in 1877 Grand Cafe de la Comedie at Lafayette in 1905 The French Revolution changed Toulouse's role and its political and social structure. The city marked the Parisian movement with looting. Five months later, when the Ancien R√©gime was abolished, parlement and the Capitouls received little popular support. Toulouse's regional influence was reduced to the department of Haute-Garonne. Clergy were required to observe the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, imposed by the National Constituent Assembly. A new archbishop was named, over the objections of Lom√©nie de Brienne. The Capitouls were abolished on December 14, 1789; Joseph de Rigaud was Toulouse's first mayor, elected on February 28, 1790. In 1793, during the Paris Commune, Toulouse refused to join the Provence and Aquitaine federalists in Paris. The prospect of war against Austria and internal resistance initiated the Reign of Terror. In 1799 the fortified city resisted attack of British and Spanish royalist armies in the first battle of Toulouse, and Napoleon visited the city in 1808. In 1814, during the battle of Toulouse, the British army entered the city (which had been abandoned by the imperial army). It was the last battle of the Empire, since Napoleon had abdicated eight days earlier; French commander Jean-de-Dieu Soult had not been informed. Wellington's army was welcomed by royalists, preparing Toulouse for the restoration of Louis XVIII. 20th century 21st century Furled flags of France, the European Union and the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es on the Toulouse Capitole after Mohammed Merah's shootings in the city The AZF chemical plant in Toulouse exploded on September 21, 2001. The explosion, which destroyed the plant‚Äî from the city centre‚Äîalso damaged houses (including more than 20,000 flats), schools, churches, monuments and shops. Twenty-nine people died, and several thousand were injured. The explosion originated in a building containing ammonium nitrate. In March 2012 local Islamic extremist Mohammed Merah opened fire at a Jewish school in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. One of the children, an eight-year-old girl, was shot in the head at point-blank range and a 17-year-old boy was critically wounded. President Nicolas Sarkozy called it an \\"obvious\\" antisemitic attack: \\"I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side.\\" The Israeli Prime Minister condemned the \\"despicable anti-Semitic\\" murders. After a 32-hour siege and standoff with the police outside his house followed by a raid, Merah jumped off a balcony and was shot in the head and killed. Merah had told police during the standoff that he intended to continue attacking, and loved death as the police loved life. He claimed a connection to al-Qaeda.

They are often found in abundance on public beaches. The teeth shown here were collected in Castle Hayne, North Carolina, and are from the Eocene and Cretaceous divisions. Fossil collecting (sometimes, in a non-scientific sense, fossil hunting) is the collection of fossils for scientific study, hobby, or profit. Fossil collecting, as practiced by amateurs, is the predecessor of modern paleontology and many still collect fossils and study fossils as amateurs. Professionals and amateurs alike collect fossils for their scientific value. A commercial trade in fossils has also long existed, with some of this being practised illegally. Process =Locating fossils= Rock type Fossils are generally found in sedimentary rock with differentiated strata representing a succession of deposited material. The occurrence of fossil bearing material depends on environmental factors before and after the time of preservation. After death, the first preserving factor is a rapid burial in water bodies or terrestrial sediment which would help in preserving the specimen. These rocks types are usually termed clastic rock, and are further subdivided into fine, medium and coarse grained material. While fossils can be found in all grain types, more detailed specimens are found in the fine grained material. A second type of burial is the non-clastic rock, form where the rock is made up of the precipitation of compacted fossil material, types of rock include limestone and coal. The third fossil bearing material is the evaporates, which precipitate out of concentrated dissolved salts to form nodular deposits, examples include rock salt and phosphate concentrations. The evaporates are usually associated with gastropod, algae, vertebrate, and trace fossils. Fossils are not to be found in areas of igneous rock (except in some beds between lava flows). In rocks which have undergone metamorphism, fossils are generally so distorted that they are difficult to recognize or have been destroyed completely. Preservation After burial various factors are at work to endanger the current fossil's preserved state. Chemical alteration would change the mineral composition of the fossil, but generally not its appearance, lithification would distort its appearance, the fossil itself may be fully or partially dissolved leaving only a fossil mold. Exposure College students collecting fossils as part of their invertebrate paleontology course. This is a roadside outcrop of Ordovician limestones and shales in southeastern Indiana. Areas where sedimentary rocks are being eroded include exposed mountainous areas, river banks and beds, wave washed sea cliffs, and engineering features like quarries and road cuts. Coal mining operations often yield excellent fossil plants, but the best ones are to be found not in the coal itself but in the associated sedimentary rock deposits called coal measures. Wave-washed sea cliffs and foreshore exposures are often good places to search for fossils, but always be aware of the state of the tides in the area. Never take chances by climbing high cliffs of crumbling rock or clay (many have died attempting it). Dried up natural lake beds and caves in the form of pitfall traps frequently also have high concentrations of fossils (e.g., Cuddie Springs and Naracoorte Caves in Australia). Generally in appearance, a fossil will be either a different colour to the surrounding rock, because of the different mineral content, will have a defining shape and texture or a combination of both. A fossil can also be extracted from its geological environment, having similar characteristics in colour naturally embed from the sedimentary formation (surrounding rock) it was found within. =Collecting techniques= The techniques used to collect fossils vary depending on the sediment or rock in which the fossils are to be found. For collecting in rock a geological hammer, a variety of cold chisels and a mallet are used to split and break rocks to reveal fossils. Since the rock is deposited in layers, these layers may be split apart to reveal fossils. For soft sediments and unconsolidated deposits, such as sands, silts, and clays, a spade, flat-bladed trowel, and stiff brushes are used. Sieves in a variety of mesh sizes are used to separate fossils from sands and gravels. Sieving is a rougher technique for collecting fossils and can destroy fragile ones. Sometimes, water is run through a sieve to help remove silt and sand. This technique is called wet sieving Fossils tend to be very fragile and are generally not extracted entirely from the surrounding rock (the matrix) in the field. Cloth, cotton, small boxes and aluminum foil are frequently used to protect fossils being transported. Occasionally, large fragile specimens may need to be protected and supported using a jacket of plaster before their removal from the rock. If a fossil is to be left in situ, a cast may be produced, using plaster of paris or latex. While not preserving every detail, such a cast is inexpensive, easier to transport, causes less damage to the environment, and leaves the fossil in place for others. Fossilized tracks are frequently documented with casts. Subtle fossils which are preserved solely as impressions in sandy layers, such as the Ediacaran fossils, are also usually documented by means of a cast, which shows detail more clearly than the rock itself. =Preparation and cleaning= Sometimes, for smaller fossils, a stiff brush may simply be used to dust off and clean the fossil. For larger fossils, a chisel can be used to remove large bits of dirt, however, you run the risk of damaging the fossil. Running water can cause some types of fossils to either dislodge from the rock, or even crumble and break apart, for they are very fragile. Dental tools are sometimes used to remove small amounts of rock from the fossil. =Documentation= A knowledge of the precise location a fossil is essential if the fossil is to have any scientific value. Details of the parent rock strata, the location of the find, and other fossil material associated with the find help scientists to place the fossil in context, in terms of the time, location and situation in which the organism lived. Data logs, photographs, and sketchs may accompany detailed field notes to assist in the locating of a fossiliferous outcrop. Individual fossils are ideally cataloged with a locality number and a unique specimen number. This allows a collection to be easily searched and specimens located. Catologing of collections is almost universal in large institutions like museums. Collecting ethics To collect fossils, there are various legal realities that must be observed. Permission should be sought before collection begins on private land. Hammering the rocks in national parks and other areas of natural beauty is often discouraged and in most cases is illegal. The first expressly worded fossil-collecting code was published from the museum-home of pioneering geologist Hugh Miller at Cromarty, on the Highland east coast of Scotland, 11 April 2008. It was introduced by Michael Russell, Minister for Environment, Scotland, as part of celebrations honouring the bicentennial of the founding of the Geological Society of London. The code supplements an existing draft drawn up by English Nature. The code advises fossil collectors to seek permission from landowners, to collect responsibly, record details, seek advice on finding an unusual fossil and label the specimens and care for them. Its principles establish a framework of advice on best practices in the collection, identification, conservation and storage of fossil specimens. The non-binding code of ethics for this field was drawn up by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) following many months of consultation with fossil collectors, landowners, palaeontological researchers, and staff of Scotland's museums. =Fossil trade= Tarbosaurus and Saurolophus skeletons that were smuggled to the US, and subsequently returned to Mongolia, at Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs Fossil trading is the practice of buying and selling fossils. This is illegal when it comes to stolen fossils, and some important scientific specimens are sold to collectors, rather than given or obtained by museums and institutes of study. Much focus has been put on the illegal fossil dealing in China, where many specimens have been stolen. The trade is lucrative, and many celebrities collect fossils. The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP), an international association of professional and amateur vertebrate paleontologists, believes that scientifically important fossils‚Äîespecially but not exclusively those found on public lands‚Äîshould be held in perpetuity in the public trust, preferably in a museum or research institution, where they can benefit the scientific community as a whole as well as future generations. In the United States, Paleontological Resources Preservation Act. S. 546 and H. R. 2416 were introduced in the US Congress with SVP's full support. Many commercial fossil collectors and dealers believe that such policies are a breach of their rights. The argument has also been put forth that there are too few professional paleontologists to collect and preserve fossils currently exposed to the elements, and that it is therefore essential that private citizens be allowed to collect them for the sake of their preservation. Eric Scott, the Curator of Paleontology for the San Bernardino County Museum, argues that 1) private citizens and amateur (not for profit) collectors can and do participate frequently in the permitted recovery and preservation of significant vertebrate fossils, and 2) preservation of significant fossils does not require or mandate sale of those fossils. According to the ethics by- law of SVP, \\"The barter, sale, or purchase of scientifically significant vertebrate fossils is not condoned, unless it brings them into or keeps them within a public trust.\\" Some fossil trade is not for collecting but due to the use of certain fossils in traditional medicine mainly in East Asia but also in Europe and other places. Societies and clubs Many include fossil collectors. Lapidary clubs also include fossil collectors. In addition, paleontological societies and fossil clubs exist. There is some overlap between fossil collecting, mineral collecting, and amateur geology.

The first truggies were built for racing in the SCORE and BITD off-road desert racing series, held in Mexico, California, Nevada and Arizona. History Desert off-road racing began in the 1960s in Baja California and expanded over the next 30 years to include dozens of races and several sanctioning organizations. These organizations created a class structure so that while many types of vehicles could race, direct competition could be segmented into groups of similar vehicles. These classes evolved over time, and included classes for near-stock vehicles, as well as \\"open\\" classes that permitted extremely unique custom- built vehicles. One of the most popular and fastest classes in the 1990s was the 'Open Buggy' or 'Unlimited' class, which permitted maximum leeway in designing a vehicle. Most buggies of the era remained loosely based on the architecture of the original VW Beetle automobile, with a rear engine, an independent rear transaxle suspension, and relatively shorter wheelbase. The \\"open\\" or \\"unlimited\\" buggy classes became the home to extremely high performance vehicles. These \\"Class 1 unlimited\\" buggies soon did away with the entire production Volkswagen chassis and sheet metal, and instead used a full tube chassis. In almost all cases they continued to use the rear-engine / transaxle architecture of the VW, replacing the iconic Volkswagen's air cooled 4-cylinder boxer engine with larger and more powerful engines from a variety of manufacturers, especially the related Porsche motors. Transaxle strength was often a limiting factor of these designs, while their greatest attributes included their light weight, extreme wheel travel, strength and overall custom built suitability to the task of racing at high speeds on harsh desert roads. Another groups of classes that had increasing popularity throughout the 1990s were the various truck based classes, for both mini and full-sized trucks. These truck classes were popular as they reflected more closely the vehicles bought by average American and Mexican consumers for use off-road, as they were based on modified production trucks of the era. The fastest truck classes evolved over time from one with limited modifications to a more open class rules, that permitted massive changes to many aspects of the vehicle, but still generally required using the stock frame and some of the body from a production vehicle. These high-end trucks were both very fast and very reliable. Their greatest attributes included extremely large and powerful front-mounted V8 engines, larger wheels and tires to absorb rough terrain, extremely rugged rear truck axles, and increasingly long travel suspension. Truggy racing the Baja 1000 In 1994 SCORE decided to run the Parker 400 off- road race over two days. Day one would see the new class of Trophy Trucks run on the course, and day two would see all other classes race over the same course. Jim Smith, owner of Ultra Custom Wheels entered his Mike Smith built Trophy Truck and also entered a Class One car into the race. However the Class One car, was in fact his Trophy Truck without its body, but with its interior aluminium panels painted black. Jim and his crew called it a truggy and the name took hold. In 1995 the team Terrible Herbst Motorsports decided to build an unlimited Class 1 buggy that used the basic front engine, rear solid axle architecture of a truck. This vehicle, which was designed and fabricated by Mike Smith Fabrication. it was built like an unlimited buggy, with a full custom triangulated tubular chrome-moly chassis, but with the truck-like layout of big American V-8 motor in front of the driver, and a very strong truck-style rear axle and large 37\\" Trophy truck sized wheels and tires on all corners. The combination in many ways combined the best characteristics of each of the two donor types: the lower weight, higher strength chassis, and extremely large suspension travel of the buggies, with the massive horsepower and stronger rear end design of the top trucks. The Terrible Herbst Truggy was given the name \\"El Tiberon\\" and \\"The Landshark\\", in part due to the paint scheme originally applied to the all-fiberglass custom body of the vehicle. It dominated class one for many years after its introduction, winning back-to- back SCORE Class 1 titles in 1997 and 1998, as well as the overall (all classes) points championship in 1998. It continued to be the most dominant vehicle in the sport for nearly a decade, winning first and second place repeatedly in both class and overall categories in both the SCORE and the BITD series. As a result of this domination the truggy format became popular with other builders and the term became the generic term from a specially built off-road vehicle that uses truck architecture (front engine, solid rear axle) but unlimited buggy style construction (tube chassis, no production parts retained). The format also became popular with the newer disciplines of closed-course stadium off-road racing, and extreme rock-crawling, where 4-wheel drive versions were created.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed October 3, 2011 tributary of the Merrimack River in eastern Massachusetts in the United States. The river drains a small rural and suburban region northwest of Boston. One of the most famous small rivers in U.S. history, it was the scene of an important early battle of the American Revolutionary War and was the subject of a famous 19th-century book by Henry David Thoreau. Description and early history The river begins in Middlesex County, formed by the confluence of the Sudbury and Assabet rivers at Egg Rock, near the Concord town center. It flows generally north, from eastern Concord (along the northwestern edge of the Boston metropolitan area), joining the Merrimack River from the south on the eastern side of Lowell. It is a gently flowing stream with little variation in topography along most of its route. Its drainage basin stretches into Worcester County and includes 36 towns within Massachusetts. Native Americans called it the Musketaquid or \\"grass-grown\\" river, because its sluggish waters abound in aquatic or semi- aquatic vegetation and its banks are fringed with wild grasses and sedges which stretch for miles along both sides of this placid stream. This creates a good environment for a variety of fish, including bass, shad, and alewife (river herring), pickerel, carp, and American eel. Native Americans wove sticks in intricate designs to trap Alewives and other migrating fish at the mouths of rivers throughout this region. By 1635, settlers from England began to arrive, and they gave the river its present name. On April 19, 1775, the Old North Bridge over the river in the town of Concord was famously the scene of the Battle of Concord (on the same day when the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired at nearby Lexington). The current version of the bridge (a reproduction) is preserved by the National Park Service. Henry David Thoreau wrote his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, in 1849 while living at nearby Walden Pond. His book recounted a seven-day boat trip on the rivers with his brother John, who had since died. Thoreau recounted his exploration of the natural beauty of the river, and his accompanied thoughts on such eternal themes as truth, poetry, travel, and friendship. Despite the growth of the suburbs in the vicinity of the river, it remains a popular canoeing destination today. The last mile of the river in Lowell is serious class 3+/4 whitewater. Dams cause fish population to decrease Dams were built along the Concord River to increase crop production and also to provide a source of power for operating mills. By the 19th century, the native population of shad and alewife became extinct, because the dams prevented the mature fish from returning upstream to spawn. Alewife and other anadromous fish are migratory. They hatch in fresh water, make their way to the sea to grow, then return as adults to fresh water to spawn, usually near where they had hatched. This instinct is imprinted within the fish when it is born. So, when the route upstream became blocked, the cycle was broken. The Faulkner Dam in North Billerica is just one of many blockages that caused the alewife population to collapse on the Concord River. At this point, water was diverted north to Lowell and south to Charlestown to run the Middlesex Canal. Effects of pollution During the 19th century, the Concord River was near the heart of the US Industrial Revolution. Textile, paper, tanning, and mining industries all emerged during this period. Industrial wastes were dumped into the river, along with untreated sewage and other organic waste. Industrial development within the watershed peaked in the 1920s. The early 1960s saw an increase in the number of chemical and metal firms, many supporting the electronics industry within the Boston metropolitan area. By the 1960s, the Merrimack River was considered one of the top ten most polluted waterways in America. The Concord River empties into the Merrimack River. The passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 signaled the beginning of US efforts to improve the quality of its waterways. The act imposed stricter controls on point source discharges into rivers and other navigable waters. This eventually led to the installation of three wastewater treatment plants on the banks of the Concord River: one in Concord and two in Billerica. These plants have helped to prevent subsequent damage to the river ecosystem when they were able to operate within federally mandated limits. Pollutants such as heavy metals and PCBs remain trapped in the sediment. Throughout much of the Sudbury River and downstream into the Concord River, fish consumption is banned due to mercury-laden sediments from the Nyanza Superfund site and other sources. Perchlorate was detected in the Concord River in August 2004. Initially, it was believed that explosives used in road and building construction were the source of this pollutant. However, an investigation by the town of Billerica eventually determined that the source was a local company that produced surgical and medical materials. The company was using 220 gallons per month of perchloric acid in a bleaching process, and rinse water was being discharged into the sewage system. After the company was identified, it voluntarily shut down until ion exchange equipment could be installed in accordance with environmental guidelines. In May 2007, Billerica was the subject of legal action and forced to pay a $250,000 penalty for discharging pollutants into the Concord River. The action was brought by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) because the town of Billerica exceeded allowable effluent limits for phosphorus, fecal coliform bacteria, pH, and ammonia nitrogen. The town was also charged with failing to submit discharge monitoring reports, failing to comply with monitoring requirements, and failing to submit infiltration and inflow reporting. According to the EPA, Billerica's discharges of phosphorus created an overabundance of nutrients, which damaged the river by stimulating excessive aquatic plant growth. Diadromous fish recovery effort In May 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Massachusetts Riverways Program, and volunteers from the Sudbury Valley Trustees (SVT) released 7,000 adult alewife (river herring) into the Concord River. They were transferred from the Nemasket River so that they could lay their eggs and spawn upstream. This imprinted the young alewives with the Concord as their new home river. The experiment did not succeed, as too few fish returned to the base of the first dam on the Concord River. A feasibility study published in 2016 is again exploring steps necessary for returning diadromous fish to the Concord River, and farther upstream, to the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers. Anadromous describes species that live in salt water but lay eggs in fresh water - such as alewives and shad; diadromous is a larger grouping which includes species that mature in fresh water but return to salt water to lay eggs - such as eels.

This duck was similar in size to the red-breasted merganser. The adult male had a dark reddish-brown head, crest and neck, with bluish black mantle and tail and slate grey wings. The female was slightly smaller with a shorter crest. Illustration from 1909 Drawing of the head This bird was first collected when a French expedition led by the explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville on the ships L'Astrolabe and La Zelee visited the Auckland Islands in 1840. Its decline was caused by a combination of hunting and predation by introduced mammals. The bird was not flightless, but rather hard to flush; it preferred to hide between rocks when pursued. The last sighting was of a pair shot on January 9, 1902. It was not found in a 1909 search, and a thorough 1972/1973 exploration of possible habitat concluded that it was long extinct (Williams & Weller, 1974). Subsequent fossil discoveries suggest that this merganser was previously resident in the South Island, and on Stewart Island/Rakiura in New Zealand. Fossils of a subspecies or closely related species have also been found on the Chatham Islands. There exists a short remark mentioning \\"a merganser\\" found on Campbell Island in McCormick (1842), but this may just as well refer to the semi-marine Campbell teal which is otherwise missing in his notes: he only mentions the Pacific black duck (\\"a New Zealand species of duck\\").

The organization is an information sharing and analysis effort serving the interests, and combining the knowledge base of, a wide range of private sector and government members. InfraGard is an association of individuals that facilitates information sharing and intelligence between businesses, academic institutions, state and local law enforcement agencies, and other participants dedicated to prevent hostile acts against the United States. InfraGard's mutual nondisclosure agreements among its members (individuals) and the FBI promotes trusted discussions of vulnerabilities and solutions that companies and individuals may be hesitant to place in the public domain and provide access to additional threat information from the FBI. History InfraGard began in the Cleveland, Ohio, Field Office in 1996, and has since expanded to become a national-level program, with InfraGard coordinators in every FBI field office. Originally, it was a local effort to gain support from the information technology industry and academia for the FBI's investigative efforts in the cyber arena, but it has since expanded to a much wider range of activities surrounding the nation's critical infrastructure. The program expanded to other FBI Field Offices, and in 1998 the FBI assigned national program responsibility for InfraGard to the former National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) directed by RADM James B. Plehal and to the FBI's Cyber Division in 2003. Since 2003, InfraGard Alliances and the FBI said that they have developed a TRUST-based public-private sector partnership to ensure reliability and integrity of information exchanged about various terrorism, intelligence, criminal, and security matters. It supports FBI priorities in the areas of counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence, and cybercrime. Purpose InfraGard is focused on protecting the 16 critical infrastructures outlined by Presidential Directive 21: Critical Infrastructure Security & Resilience by sharing threat information, assisting the FBI in finding and prosecuting those who attack critical infrastructure through physical or cyber means, provide training for active shooter scenarios, cyber defense, and any other threats against the nation. The organization is committed to providing the tools and resources needed by those who own and operate the nation's critical infrastructure to protect their enterprises and maintain the services necessary for a safe and prosperous nation. Information sharing InfraGard chapters also participate to assure that the critical infrastructure owners and operators‚Äîestimated at 85% private sector‚Äîare engaged and represented in local and regional planning efforts. Working on all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, the organization provides resources and information not only on prevention, but also on building resilience and response capabilities. Training InfraGard chapters around the nation also provide cyber and physical security training sessions that focus on the latest threats as identified by the FBI. Sessions include threat briefings, technical sessions on cyber and physical attack vectors, response training, and other resources to help CISOs and CSOs protect their enterprise. InfraGard approaches threats to critical infrastructure from both a tactical and strategic level, addressing the needs of those on the front lines of security as well as those decision makers tasked with assessing their enterprise's vulnerabilities and allocating resources to protect it. The information sharing between the organization and government has been criticized by those protecting civil liberties, concerned the membership would be surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI. The group has also been the subject of hacking attacks intended to embarrass the FBI. Local chapters regularly meet to discuss the latest threats or listen to talks from subject matter experts on security issues, with membership open to U.S. citizens at no cost. As of July, 2012, the organization reported membership at over 54,677 (including FBI).  Critical infrastructure  InfraGard focuses on the development, management and protection of critical infrastructure. InfraGard has a nationwide focus group that reviews threats that could disrupt critical infrastructure nationwide for a month or more named the electromagnetic pulse special interest group (EMP SIG). This is an all-hazards approach that looks at manmade and natural electromagnetic pulse (EMP), cyber attack, coordinated physical attack, pandemics or insider threats and mitigating actions that could minimize such threats. Mitigation strategies include hardening and prevention strategies in addition to the development of local infrastructure that could make local communities more robust and sustainable. (See EMP SIG press release and guidance document. See also the website of the association of universities involved in public policy, the Policy Studies Organization, who produces the technology policy conference called the Dupont Summit in which the InfraGard National EMP SIG brought public and private sector leaders to discuss these emerging threat issues: http://www.ipsonet.org/conferences/the-dupont- summit/dupont-summit-2012/infragard-emp-sig ) Civil liberties Partnerships between government agencies and private organizations has its critics. Concerned about civil liberties, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that there \\"is evidence that InfraGard may be closer to a corporate TIPS program, turning private-sector corporations ‚Äî some of which may be in a position to observe the activities of millions of individual customers ‚Äî into surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI\\". Concluding that \\"any program that institutionalizes close, secretive ties between such organizations raises serious questions about the scope of its activities, now and in the future.\\" While others describing Infragard state \\"the architecture of the Internet‚Äîand the many possible methods of attack‚Äî requires governments, corporations, and private parties to work together to protect network security and head off threats before they occur.\\" Responding to the ACLU criticism, Chairwoman Kathleen Kiernan of the InfraGard National Members Alliance (INMA) denies that InfraGard is anything but beneficial to all Americans stating \\"It's not an elitist group in any way, shape or form,\\" she says. \\"We're out there trying to protect everybody. Any U.S. citizen on the planet is eligible to apply to InfraGard.\\" LulzSec attacks In 2011, LulzSec claimed responsibility for attacking chapter websites managed by local members in Connecticut and Atlanta, in order to embarrass the FBI with \\"simple hacks\\". The group leaked some of InfraGard member e-mails and a database of local users. The group defaced the website posting the following message, \\"LET IT FLOW YOU STUPID FBI BATTLESHIPS\\", accompanied with a video.

After its launch in 1981, it became the basis for all Chrysler-developed 4-cylinder engines until the Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 & 2.4 engine family was released in 1994. 2.2 The first version of this engine family was a normally aspirated unit. Developed under the leadership of Chief Engineer ‚Äì Engine Design and Development Willem Weertman and head of performance tuning Charles \\"Pete\\" Hagenbuch, who had worked on most of Chrysler's V-8 engines and the Chrysler Slant-6 engine, it was introduced in the 1981 Dodge Aries, Dodge Omni, Plymouth Horizon and Plymouth Reliant, and was produced until 2000. The 2.2 has an undersquare bore and stroke, which gives it a displacement of . It is a siamesed engine: there are no coolant passages between cylinders. The bore spacing is , limiting the potential for increased bore diameter. All 2.2 engines have cast iron blocks, use a timing belt, and are non-interference engines. The earliest version used a two-barrel carburetor, but fuel injection was introduced in 1984 on both turbocharged and normally aspirated models (it is used on all 2.5 liter engines). The fuel injection was standard on some higher end (Chrysler E-Class/Chrysler New Yorker/Dodge 600 and the Dodge Daytona/Chrysler Laser). In 1985 it became optional on the lower end models (Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant), eventually replacing the carbureted variant on all the models. The initial carbureted 2.2 initially produced , but the output was increased to and . Later versions were fuel-injected and produced to and , and a High-Output version for the Dodge Charger produced and . Four series of turbocharged 2.2 and 2.5 liter engines were produced, normally referred to as Turbo I, Turbo II, Turbo III, and Turbo IV. The primary difference between these engines was the use of an intercooler (in all except Turbo I). The Turbo III, ironically developed after the Turbo IV, pioneered returnless fuel injection, and was coupled to high-performance, four-valve-per-cylinder heads, bringing from the 2.2 liter engine. The Turbo IV pioneered the use of variable nozzle technology to minimize lag. The 2.2 was made at Chrysler's Trenton Engine plant in Trenton, Michigan. In 1995 Chrysler sold much of the machining equipment as well as the license to the design, to First Auto Works of China, after negotiations which had begun in the mid-eighties. The Trenton plant largely switched to the new Chrysler 3.3 engine production, while FAW continues to build the 2.2, which they used in their version of the Audi 100. * 1983‚Äì1984 Chrysler E-Class * 1983‚Äì1986 Chrysler Executive * 1984‚Äì1986 Chrysler Laser * 1982‚Äì1990 Chrysler LeBaron (fuel-injected after 1985) * 1985‚Äì1988 Chrysler LeBaron GTS * 1981‚Äì1982 Dodge 024 * 1982‚Äì1983 Dodge 400 * 1983‚Äì1988 Dodge 600 (fuel-injected after 1984) * 1981‚Äì1989 Dodge Aries (fuel-injected after 1985) * 1984‚Äì1987 Dodge Caravan * 1983‚Äì1987 Dodge Charger * 1987‚Äì1988 Dodge Dakota * 1984‚Äì1990 Dodge Daytona * 1981‚Äì1990 Dodge Omni (fuel-injected after 1987) * 1985‚Äì1989 Dodge Lancer * 1982‚Äì1984 Dodge Rampage * 1987‚Äì1994 Dodge Shadow * 1985‚Äì1988 Plymouth Caravelle * 1981‚Äì1990 Plymouth Horizon (fuel-injected after 1987) * 1981‚Äì1989 Plymouth Reliant (fuel-injected after 1985) * 1983 Plymouth Scamp (Dodge Rampage twin) * 1987‚Äì1994 Plymouth Sundance * 1981‚Äì1982 Plymouth TC3 * 1983‚Äì1987 Plymouth Turismo * 1984‚Äì1987 Plymouth Voyager =High Output= The 1983 and 1984 Dodge Shelby Charger was more of a handling package, but the regular 2.2 L engine was modified somewhat. This High Output 2.2 used a revised camshaft to boost output to and , and the block was decked to increase the compression ratio. These modifications allowed the Shelby Charger to hit in 5.5 seconds and cover the quarter mile (402 m) in under 16 seconds. The 1985 Dodge Charger Shelby used the 2.2 Turbo I engine instead, so this high output 2.2 was made an option on regular Dodge Chargers that year.

This Turbo II designation was first used in the 1986 Shelby GLH-S and the 1987 Shelby Charger GLH-S. Shelby Automobiles modified a stock Turbo I engine by swapping several pre-production pieces from the Turbo II inline-four engine. These changes included an intercooler and other changes to produce 175 hp (130 kW) and a flat 175 ft¬∑lbf (237 N¬∑m) torque curve. Not included were any of the durability changes to the short block (forged crank, full floating pin, stouter connecting rods, etc.) of the 1987 Chrysler Turbo II engine that was produced by the factory the following year. Shelby installed the factory produced Turbo II in his Shelby Lancer and Shelby CSX. Chrysler's strengthened version of this engine, with a forged crankshaft and connecting rods, was used in the Shelby Z package of the 1987‚Äì1989 Dodge Daytona and other cars. Output of the production Turbo II was and with of boost when mated to the stronger A520 5-speed manual transaxle. A similar, one-piece version of the special two-piece intake manifold used on the Turbo II, minus the air charge temperature sensor, was added to the Turbo I for 1988. The next year, the new common block was introduced; it was used for all subsequent versions of the 2.2 and 2.5, including the 2.2 L Turbo II, which then continued unchanged through 1990. * 1986 Shelby GLH-S (Omni) * 1987 Shelby Charger Turbo * 1987 Shelby GLHS (Charger) * 1985‚Äì1993 Consulier GTP * 1987‚Äì1989 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z * 1987‚Äì1988 Shelby CSX * 1987 Shelby Lancer * 1988‚Äì1989 Dodge Lancer Shelby * 1988‚Äì1989 Chrysler LeBaron GTS hatchback * 1987‚Äì1989 Chrysler LeBaron coupe / convertible GTC * 1989 Dodge Daytona C/S =Turbo III= The Turbo III used a Lotus-made DOHC 16-valve head.

This version was related to the Turbo II but used a special 16-valve head ‚Äî not the same as that used in the Turbo III ‚Äî pistons, connecting rods, intake manifold, crankshaft and other components. No parts are interchangeable with other versions of the engine. The 2.2 TC engine was an international effort: The cylinder head was cast in England by Cosworth and finished in Italy by Maserati using a cam over bucket design. The pistons are forged and came from Mahle in Germany, and a Japanese turbocharger was sourced from IHI. The camshafts were designed by Florida-based Crane but were constructed by Maserati in Modena. The rods are forged Casar units and use a unique rod bearing size. The crankshaft is also forged and weighs 53 pounds. Only 501 Chrysler TCs were produced with the DOHC 16-valve head. This engine shares essentially only the front and rear main seals, oil pan seal, intermediate shaft and bearings, main bearings (only, rod bearings are unique), and distributor with any other Chrysler 2.2/2.5. This head was also used in IMSA racing, but not in turbocharged form. 2.5 In 1986, Chrysler increased the displacement of the engine to and added counterrotating balance shafts to smooth out the vibrations and harsh harmonics normally produced by long-stroke 4-cylinder engines. The increased displacement came from a raised deck and longer stroke, making the 2.5 engine even more undersquare and tuned for low-end torque rather than high-RPM power. This engine replaced the Mitsubishi 2.6 engine Chrysler had been using. In normally aspirated form, the 2.5 produced and . In 1989 there was a redesign of the 2.5 to permit both it and the 2.2 to use a common cylinder block. The crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons are completely different in the common-block 2.5 compared to the previous 2.5. This engine competed with Ford Motor Company's HSC engine, which was increased from 2.3 L to 2.5 L for use in the 1986 to 1991 Taurus. The Chrysler 2.5 was retired in 1995. * 1986‚Äì1993 Chrysler LeBaron * 1986‚Äì1987 Chrysler New Yorker * 1986‚Äì1988 Dodge 600 * 1986‚Äì1989 Dodge Aries * 1987¬Ω‚Äì1995 Dodge Caravan * 1989‚Äì1995 Dodge Dakota * 1986‚Äì1993 Dodge Daytona * 1988‚Äì1993 Dodge Dynasty * 1986‚Äì1989 Dodge Lancer * 1987‚Äì1994 Dodge Shadow * 1989‚Äì1995 Dodge Spirit * 1989‚Äì1995 Plymouth Acclaim * 1986‚Äì1988 Plymouth Caravelle * 1986‚Äì1989 Plymouth Reliant * 1987‚Äì1994 Plymouth Sundance * 1987¬Ω‚Äì1995 Plymouth Voyager =Turbo I= The 2.5 engine was offered in a Turbo I form starting in 1989.

This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler's US- market Lean Burn emission control systems of the late 1970s. This configuration was discontinued in favour of electronic fuel injection for the 1991 model year, when exhaust emission regulations took force in Mexico. =FFV= From 1993 to 1995, a multipoint fuel injected non-turbo version of the 2.5 engine was installed in flexible-fuel Dodge Spirits and Plymouth Acclaims. This engine and its fuel supply and computerized management system were specially modified to run on fuel containing up to 85% Methanol. Most of the MPFI system was common with the Mexican-market 2.5 MPFI engine. Modifications included upgraded seal and gasket materials, chrome piston rings, stainless-steel fuel system components, sion fuel injectors internally plated with nickel, and fuel composition sensors. MPFI From 1991 to 1995 in the Mexican market, multipoint fuel injected, non-turbo version of the 2.2 and 2.5 were installed in many Chrysler Corporation vehicles. This version of the 2.5 was rated at , and in most cases lacked the balance shafts used in all other versions of the 2.5. The MPFI system gave better driveability, performance and fuel economy, and cleaner emissions, but was nevertheless not used elsewhere than the Mexican domestic market and Chrysler de Mexico's export markets. MPFI 2.5 L MPFI engine installed in 1994 Mexican Chrysler Spirit Engine computers Various kinds of Engine Control Units were used with the 2.2 and 2.5 engines. From 1984‚Äì1987, the ECU was divided into the Logic Module (LM), which was inside the passenger cabin, and the Power Module located near the battery on the left front fender. The LM used a Motorola 6803U4 processor operating at 1 MHz, with 256 bytes of RAM and either two 8K EPROMs or one 16K EPROM. From 1988‚Äì1989, a SMEC (Single Module Engine Controller) was used. This was a complete redesign of the older system, using modern CAD for board design, and higher density SMD components. The processor was a 68HC11 operating at 2 MHz with 256 bytes of RAM and a 32K EPROM. Functionally, the SMEC was the combination of the earlier Logic and Power modules into one unit. Starting in 1990, a more advanced SBEC (Single Board Engine Controller) was used, which integrated the earlier two board computer into a single board.

Background The Indian Campaign Medal was established by War Department General Orders 12 in 1907. It was created at the same time as the Civil War Campaign Medal. The initial ribbon was all red; however, two black stripes were added in December 1917 because of the similarity to a ribbon used by the French for the French Legion of Honor. Campaign streamers of the same design as the service ribbon are authorised for display by units receiving campaign credit participation for Indian Wars as early as 1790. The inscriptions for streamers displayed on the organizational flag will be as indicated in the unit's lineage and honors. The inscriptions for the 14 streamers displayed on the Army flag are listed in AR 840-10 and AR 600-8-22. Eligible campaigns The Code of Federal Regulations declares service in the following campaigns as requirements for award of the Indian Campaign Medal: #Southern Oregon, Idaho, northern California, and Nevada between 1865 and 1868. # Against the Comanches and confederate tribes in Kansas, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Indian Territory between 1867 and 1875. #Modoc War between 1872 and 1873. #Against the Apaches in Arizona in 1873. #Against the Northern Cheyennes and Sioux between 1876 and 1877. #Nez Perce War in 1877. #Bannock War in 1878. #Against the Northern Cheyennes between 1878 and 1879. #Against the Sheep-Eaters, Piutes, and Bannocks between June and October, 1879. #Against the Utes in Colorado and Utah between September 1879 and November 1880. #Against the Apaches in Arizona and New Mexico between 1885 and 1886. #Against the Sioux in South Dakota between November 1890 and January 1891. #Against hostile Indians in any other action in which United States troops were killed or wounded between 1865 and 1891. Appearance The Code of Federal Regulations describes the medal as follows: > The medal of bronze is 11‚ÅÑ4 inches in diameter. On the obverse is a mounted > Indian facing sinister, wearing a war bonnet, and carrying a spear in his > right hand. Above the horseman are the words ‚Äò‚ÄòIndian Wars,‚Äô‚Äô and below, on > either side of a buffalo skull, the circle is completed by arrowheads, > conventionally arranged. On the reverse is a trophy, composed of an eagle > perched on a cannon supported by crossed flags, rifles, an Indian shield, > spear, and quiver of arrows, a Cuban machete, and a Sulu kriss. Below the > trophy are the words ‚Äò‚ÄòFor Service.‚Äô‚Äô The whole is surrounded by a circle > composed of the words ‚Äò‚ÄòUnited States Army‚Äô‚Äô in the upper half and thirteen > stars in the lower half. The medal is suspended by a ring from a silk moire > ribbon 13‚ÅÑ8inches in length and 13‚ÅÑ8 inches in width composed of a red > stripe (1‚ÅÑ4 inch), black stripe (3‚ÅÑ16 inch), red band (1‚ÅÑ2inch), black > stripe (3‚ÅÑ16 inch), and red stripe (1‚ÅÑ4 inch). The Indian Campaign Medal was issued as a one-time decoration only and there were no devices or service stars authorized for those who had participated in multiple actions. The only attachment authorized to the medal was the silver citation star, awarded for meritorious or heroic conduct. The silver citation star was the predecessor of the Silver Star and was awarded to eleven soldiers between 1865 and 1891. As originally issued, the medal had a solid red ribbon. In 1917 two black stripes were added to the ribbon. The reason for this change is that the ribbon of the Indian Campaign Medal was easily confused with the ribbon of the French Legion of Honor which also had a solid red ribbon.

These engines were loosely based on their predecessors, the Chrysler 2.2 & 2.5 engine, sharing the same bore. The DOHC head was developed by Chrysler with input from the Chrysler-Lamborghini team that developed the Chrysler/Lamborghini Formula 1 V12 engine in the early 1990s. Beginning in 2005, these engines were phased out in favor of the new World engine built by the Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance joint-venture. The 2.0 and 2.4 variants were built at Saltillo Engine in Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico. The 1.8 and 2.0 was also built at Trenton Engine in Trenton, Michigan, United States. 1.8 The EBD is a 1.8 L (1796 cc/109.6 cid), under-bored variant of the 2.0 L engine. This engine features a square bore and stroke with a 10.0:1 compression ratio. This engine was built at the Trenton Engine Plant for use in export market (non-US) Chrysler Neons. It produces at 5750 rpm and at 4950 rpm and meets Euro III emission standards. Applications: * 1997‚Äì1999 Chrysler Neon 2.0 The 2.0 L (1,996 cc/121.8 cid) version of the engine was the first offered. Production began in 1994 in Trenton, MI, and it was used in many Chrysler Corporation vehicles. It is available in both SOHC and DOHC 16-valve versions (4 valves per cylinder). The engine features a cast iron block, and pistons with shallow crowns to save weight. The block uses a bedplate featuring a perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons are attached to fracture-split forged, powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft on the front of the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002 and up engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the water pump housing cast partially into the engine block itself. 1995 model year engines had three features that set them apart from later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft profile that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. 2002 and earlier engines featured a one-piece cast nodular iron crankshaft with counterweights present on either side of each crank pin. A crankshaft tone wheel was present between number 1 and number 2 connecting rod pins, and was machined such that a Hall-effect magnetic pickup mounted to the engine block could read the crankshaft's position as it rotates. 2003 and later engines switched to a two-piece crankshaft. The tone wheel was re-engineered to attach to the crankshaft using three bolts, had a tone pattern substantially different from previous engines, and was moved to the rear of the crankshaft. For this reason, these engines are generally not interchangeable between the 2002 (and prior) and 2003 (and newer) model years. Up to late 1999, this engine type suffered from oil leaks between the block and cylinder head. Chrysler Corporation used several different designs of composite material head gaskets in an attempt to solve this problem. In 1998, a thicker, multi-layer steel head gasket was introduced that eliminated this oil leak. ;General Specifications *Cylinder Configuration: In-line 4 *Number of Valves: 16 (4 per cylinder) *Fuel Delivery: Sequential multi-port fuel injection *Bore x Stroke: *Displacement: *Redline: 6500 rpm *Rev Limiter: 6750 rpm =A588= The A588 is the SOHC version found in most post 2001 Chrysler products. The ECB SOHC version, found in earlier models, is identical except for the crank trigger wheel. When equipped with the newer crank wheel for the new NGC engine computer, the A588 version cannot be directly transplanted into a vehicle originally equipped with the earlier style engine using an SBEC (Single Board Engine Controller). Output is SAE at 5600 rpm with of torque at 4600 rpm. It has an aluminum SOHC cylinder head. It uses a reinforced plastic intake manifold (although a few of the 1995 and 1996 engines received an aluminum intake manifold due to a shortage of the plastic parts). They were painted black, but it's easy to see the casting marks and prints on the manifold. The aluminum version is prized among enthusiasts as it's easy to port and polish for improved airflow characteristics.

Chief differences between this version and the A588 include a cast aluminum SOHC cylinder head that more easily passes exhaust gases than the base engine, a camshaft that is optimized for higher engine speeds, a factory welded exhaust short-tube header instead of a cast exhaust manifold, and a two-piece intake manifold. This manifold features unequal- length intake runners that are switched by an electric actuator that controls butterfly-type valves in the shorter intake runners. The longer runners are always open, and provide a mild supercharging effect due to their length between 3000 rpm and 4800 rpm. The shorter runners, open from 4800 rpm to redline at wide-open throttle, also provide a tuned resonance effect due to their length. The shorter runners are also opened at wide-open throttle below 3000 rpm to provide an intake path to each cylinder that is as free-flowing as possible. Applications: * Dodge Neon R/T (2001‚Äì2004)U.S (1998-2004)Canada * Dodge Neon ACR (2001‚Äì2002)U.S (1998-2002)Canada Specifications: *Compression Ratio: 9.8:1 *Camshaft Configuration: SOHC *Power: @ 6500 rpm *Torque: @ 4800 rpm *Rev-Limiter: 6750 rpm =ECC= The DOHC ECC 2.0 produces SAE at 6500 rpm with of torque at 4800 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder head. It uses Sequential fuel injection, has 4 valves per cylinder with roller rocker arms and features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and an aluminum intake manifold. The version used in the PT Cruiser (non-US) and Dodge Neon features a cylinder head with the intake ports facing the front of the vehicle, like the SOHC A588. The 420A used in the Dodge-designed chassis, such as the Dodge Avenger and Mitsubishi Eclipse, have intake ports facing the rear of the vehicle. Most other specifications are identical, however, and even some head components (such as the valve cover) are compatible.

The code for this engine was EDZ. As with some other engines of various architecture used in Jeeps, EDZs used in the Liberty carried Chrysler's PowerTech name. The first 2.4L turbocharged engine was the EDZ turbo (variant of regular EDZ engine and developed by Chrysler's Mexican division), used on the Mexican Dodge Stratus R/T & Cirrus since 1996 to 2000. EDZ 2.4L DOHC turbocharged engine used in a Mexican Stratus R/T & Cirrus (1996-2000) The SRT-4 performance variant utilized a 2.4L Turbo. The turbocharged EDV/EDT is similar to the regular EDZ. Output is SAE at 5300 rpm with of torque at 2200-4400 rpm. This engine, code A855, has a cast iron partially open deck block and split crankcase. It uses an 8.1:1 compression ratio with Mahle cast eutectic aluminum alloy pistons, forged connecting rods with cracked caps and threaded-in rod bolts, and a cast high-hardness steel crankshaft. The cylinder head is cast aluminum, with the cylinder heads being a 48-degree pent-roof design with a partial cloverleaf between the intake valves. The valves are actuated by hydraulically adjusted rocker arms with roller cam followers. The SRT-4, PT Cruiser Turbo, Cirrus LXi [M√©xico only] and Stratus R/T [M√©xico only] use the same engine block and heads. EDV 2.4L DOHC Turbocharged engine used in a Mexicans Stratus R/T & Cirrus (2001-2006) The intake manifold, reverse-rotation turbocharger, jet oil coolers, oil pump, manual transmission, special ecu tuning, intercooler size, and weight are the only differences between those cars. The cast-aluminum 8-row Valeo intercooler is mounted in the front, and the reverse-rotation Mitsubishi TD04LR-16Gk turbocharger has a turbine inlet. The turbocharger compressor housing features a built-in bypass valve, and the turbo housing is cast into the exhaust manifold with a loop-around flow pattern. The stock SRT-4 has a maximum boost level of . But, varies boost level based on knock sensor readings. Higher octane fuel results in less knock and higher boost levels.

Usually pictured holding a staff in each hand, with fanged teeth and splayed and clawed feet, his other characteristics are unknown, although he is often pictured with snakes in his headdress or clothes. He is known as Viracocha in the Incan religion. The oldest known depiction of the Staff God was found in 2003 on some broken gourd fragments in a burial site in the Pativilca River Valley (Norte Chico region) and carbon dated to 2250 BCE. This makes it the oldest image of a god to be found in the Americas. There are scholars who maintain that the Wari-Tiwanaku Staff God is the forerunner of the Incan principal gods, Sun, Moon, and Thunder. As the chief deity, it was considered the creator god and served as the primary religious icon of the entire Peruvian Andes, particularly during the Early Horizon (900-200 B.C.) and beyond. The worship of this deity spread to the Central Andes during the Middle Horizon (600-1000 A.D.) This is supported by excavated Middle Horizon artifacts that resembled the Staff-God.  Representations and iconography  The staff god was a basic iconography shared by the cultures of pre-Columbian Peru, particularly those occupying the northern coast and the southern highlands. This is seen in the stylistic uniformity of the icons and representations, which suggested widespread adherence. There were varying depictions of the Staff-God among these Andean cultures. However, it was often portrayed as a deity in apotheosis, with hands always holding instruments of power. For instance, an artifact found at Chavin de Huantar showed the deity holding a Spondylus and Strombus shells, which were female and male symbols, respectively. This representation indicated how the Staff-God wielded authority to maintain social harmony and the Andean ideal of gender complementarity. Another Early Horizon sculpted stone, the Raimondi Stele, is perhaps the most popular representation and depicted the Staff-God as a sky or lightning god plunging down to earth. Representations of the southern highland staff god did not only carry motifs but were also presented with accompanying consorts in the form of deities painted on textiles used to decorate temple walls or ceramic vessels. The Staff God has one of the most important iconographical elements in central Andean archaeology and this is prominent in both portable and fixed art using different media such as stone, textile, and ceramic. A form of the staff god, for example, takes a central role in the Sun Gate of the Tiwanaku culture, a single-stone monolith. Tunics and ceramics from both the Tiwanaku and Wari cultures of the Middle Horizon period showcase a similar god. Another example is the giant offering jars found at Qunchupata. They were painted with the Staff-God's image, one that bears resemblance to the god's depiction at the back of the Tiwanako's Ponce Monolith.

Tritec Motors Ltda In 1997, Chrysler Corporation and Rover Group (then a subsidiary of BMW) formed a joint venture called Tritec Motors to design a new small straight-4 engine. The new company built a factory in Campo Largo of Curitiba, Brazil specifically to manufacture the new engine. The Tritec name stands for the union of the three countries involved: Germany, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. When BMW broke up the remains of Rover Group in 2000, BMW kept the stake in Tritec Motors as the engine was in use in the Mini range which BMW had retained. In 2007 BMW sold its 50% stake to DaimlerChrysler and cancelled its contract for the Tritec engine. BMW entered into a new joint venture with PSA Peugeot Citroen to develop the Prince engine which is used in the second generation Mini cars. The factory had a capacity of 400,000 engines a year, and in 2006 production was around 200,000 engines. Production ceased in June 2007 following the ending of the joint venture. In March 2008 Fiat Powertrain Technologies bought the plant and licenses to produce Tritec engines at a cost of ‚Ç¨83 million, and in 2010 subsequently launched its own E.torQ engine.

The band, fronted by Dangers (the only permanent member), has proven versatile over the years, experimenting with techno, dubstep, drum and bass, IDM, industrial, dub and jazz fusion while touring the world and influencing major acts such as Nine Inch Nails, the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy. Some of the band's earlier work has been credited with influencing the rise of the trip hop, big beat, and drum and bass genres. History =Early years= Dangers and Stephens had formed the English pop group Perennial Divide in 1986 with Paul Freeguard and released the first few Meat Beat Manifesto singles as a side project. They left Perennial Divide in 1988 to record a full Meat Beat album. The tapes of what would have been the debut MBM album were claimed to have been destroyed in a studio fire before it could be released (detailed in a publicity statement). The former founder of Sweat Box Records (Rob Deacon) said that the fire never happened. Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview. The pair then recorded the LP Storm The Studio, which got them pigeonholed as an industrial act because Sweat Box Records sold the rights to the LP to Wax Trax Records for release in the United States. In response, they released 99%, which was more techno-influenced, in May 1990. In August they released Armed Audio Warfare, which was an effort to re-create the lost tracks of the would-be d√©but album. The band's live show was conceived as an intense audio-visual experience, with dancers, led by choreographer Marcus Adams, in costumes and sets designed by artist Craig Morrison and video clips accompanying live instruments, sequenced electronic instruments, and live DJing. In the United States, they opened for Nine Inch Nails on their debut national tour in 1990. In 1991, they performed at The Limelight in Manhattan. Despite his contributions being nonmusical in nature, Adams was credited as a full band member and appeared in many of the band's record sleeves and promo photos until the release of Satyricon in 1992. Adams also appeared in several of MBM's early videos, such as \\"Strapdown\\" and \\"Psyche-Out\\". 1992's Satyricon continued to show Meat Beat adopting a more mainstream electronic sound, crediting influences of such newly popular dance bands as Orbital, The Shamen, and The Orb, all of whom had either remixed or been remixed by MBM. The album produced the hits \\"Mindstream\\" and \\"Circles\\". \\"Original Control (Version 2)\\", renamed \\"I Am Electro\\" in later compilations, is the best-known track from the album, featuring samples of recordings from the 1939 World's Fair exhibit Elektro The Robot, and was the opening song in MBM's 2005‚Äì2006 tour. =Nothing Records years, 1994‚Äì1998= In 1993 Dangers relocated from England to San Francisco, resulting in Stephens' departure from the band. At this time, Nothing Records was founded as an imprint of Interscope with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands to capitalize on the recent success of Nine Inch Nails. Nothing, helmed by Trent Reznor, signed Meat Beat Manifesto and in 1996 the double album Subliminal Sandwich was released. While this album represented MBM's major-label debut, it failed to achieve the critical and commercial successes of previous releases. The album is notable for the last appearance of Jonny Stephens who contributed guitar on the track Asbestos Lead Asbestos. After Subliminal Sandwich, Dangers put together an album called Original Fire that collected various studio rarities, B-sides, and fan favorites from the early years of MBM, in addition to some new remixes of the material. Also in 1996, the group contributed to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1997 Dangers recruited drummer Lynn Farmer and multi-instrumentalist John Wilson (MBM member 1995‚Äì1998, former Supreme Love Gods) to record and release Actual Sounds + Voices in 1998, which found the group's earlier flirtations with jazz fusion featured more prominently; the record included appearances by saxophonist Bennie Maupin. The album yielded the single \\"Prime Audio Soup\\" which was featured in the film The Matrix. While Jon Wilson left the band prior to the 1998‚Äì1999 tour, Farmer remains with the band as of Spring 2007. Wilson was replaced by former Consolidated programmer Mark Pistel, who also remains a contributing member. During these years, Dangers contributed a pair of remixes to high-profile Nine Inch Nails releases Closer to God and The Perfect Drug. After the release of Actual Sounds + Voices, Meat Beat Manifesto was let go by Nothing Records and once more appeared on independent labels. =RUOK?, 2000‚Äì2004= In 2000, Dangers released a 12\\" MBM EP of four new songs called Eccentric Objects which demonstrated a shift in Dangers' output towards simpler song structure and less sonically-dense layering. This evolution in form was full realized two years later, in 2002, with the release of Meat Beat Manifesto's seventh full-length album, RUOK?. This album prominently featured Dangers' newly acquired EMS Synthi 100, as well as guest contributions from turntablist Z-Trip and The Orb's Alex Paterson. In 2003 MBM released a remix album for Storm The Studio, followed by ...In Dub, a remix album of RUOK?. =At the Center, 2005‚Äì2007= At the Center was released on 29 May 2005. A part of independent label Thirsty Ear's Blue Series, the album is a collaboration between Jack Dangers and jazz musicians Peter Gordon (flute), Dave King (drums), and Craig Taborn (keyboards). While Dangers had, in the past, flirted with jazz instrumentation and sampling on a handful of Meat Beat Manifesto tracks, At the Center was a marked variation of the expected MBM sound and was more of a one-off experiment than a whole new direction for the band. The album has been well received by many critics, with one reviewer calling it \\"one of the best albums of the year in any genre.\\" An EP of outtakes, live tracks and a remix titled Off-Centre was released shortly after. From 2005 through 2006, MBM launched a worldwide tour, their first since 1999, making use of video sampling technology that allowed the band to trigger video clips in real-time, on two large screens positioned stage front, while the band performed either side-stage or behind the screens, out of the audience's view; instead, live video footage of the band performing was displayed onscreen alongside the pre-assembled clips. Many of the video clips used were the sources of samples previously used in various MBM tracks, such as footage of Elektro the Robot and clips from films such as Head and Dark Star. Dangers and crew performed a wide variety of hits and fan favorites from the entire back catalog, though relatively little of the new jazz fusion material from At the Center was played. In 2006, Meat Beat Manifesto's \\"Suicide\\" was released on the Underworld: Evolution soundtrack and is the only MBM track to date to prominently feature a guitar. In May 2007 Dangers released a double CD titled Archive Things 1982-88 / Purged. The first disc contained many early Meat Beat Manifesto experimentations, including demos of what would later become seminal MBM tracks such as \\"I Got the Fear\\". The second disc was an instrumental version of the Perennial Divide album, Purge. =Autoimmune and Answers Come in Dreams, 2008‚Äì2010= MBM's ninth studio album, Autoimmune, was released on 7 April 2008 in Europe via Planet Mu Records and on 8 April 2008 in the US and Canada via Metropolis Records., with each territory's issue featuring a different track listing. The album featured the first vocals by Dangers himself since 1998's Actual Sounds + Voices, as well as collaborations with DJ Z-Trip, MC Azeem, and Kenneth James Gibson. Autoimmune album credits, discogs.com, Retrieved 16 July 2015 The album has been described as a return to an older, harder MBM sound and as a dubstep album, though Dangers has stated that he prefers not to fall into any specific genre or category with his work. The lead single, \\"Guns And Lovers\\" was released as a digital single via iTunes on 18 March 2008, while the track \\"Lonely Soldier\\" was released as a single via bleep.com. Meat Beat Manifesto once more toured to support the new album with the same stage setup as the 2005‚Äì2006 tour. Meat Beat Manifesto released Answers Come in Dreams in late 2010, once more via Metropolis Records in the US and via Hydrogen Dukebox in the UK. Answers Come in Dreams continued to reference dubstep as had its predecessor Autoimmune, but overall was a darker, denser album, at times descending into beatless ambient noise passages reminiscent of the experimental second disc of 1996's Subliminal Sandwich. =Impossible Star and Opaque Couch√©, 2011-present= After the release of Answers Come in Dreams, Meat Beat Manifesto entered a period of limited activity lasting several years. Between 2011 and 2016, a small handful of EPs were released, and MBM only performed live sporadically. They appeared at the Cold Waves V festival in Chicago in 2016, the first live Meat Beat Manifesto show in five years. The following September they performed at Cold Waves LA. In January 2018 Meat Beat Manifesto released their eleventh studio album Impossible Star on the label Flexidisc. First single \\"We Are Surrounded\\" was premiered online by Igloo Magazine on 24 October 2017. The album has been called a \\"proverbial return to form\\" after the dalliances with dubstep on Autoimmune and Answers Come in Dreams. MBM also contributed an original track to the Cold Waves VII benefit compilation later that year, and a limited U.S. tour took place in the fall. Opaque Couch√©, Meat Beat Manifesto's twelfth album, was released on 10 May 2019 via Flexidisc. The track \\"Pin Drop\\" was released as a video single on YouTube on 6 March, with \\"No Design\\" following on 1 April. Considered a companion album to Impossible Star, Opaque Couch√© was named after \\"the world's ugliest color\\". MBM debuted a brand new song and video and contributed a pre- recorded performance set to the Cold Waves 2020 \\"Lost Weekend\\"; the entire festival was streamed on Twitch due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The new song also appeared on the corresponding Cold Waves 2020 compilation. Discography Meat Beat Manifesto have released a number of albums and singles, and participated in remixes and compilation albums. =Studio albums= *1989 Storm the Studio *1990 Armed Audio Warfare *1990 99% *1992 Satyricon *1996 Subliminal Sandwich *1998 Actual Sounds + Voices *2002 RUOK? *2005 At The Center *2008 Autoimmune *2010 Answers Come in Dreams *2018 Impossible Star *2019 Opaque Couch√© =Remix albums= *2003 Storm The Studio RMXS *2004 ...In Dub =Compilation albums= *1997 Original Fire *2007 Archive Things 1982-88 Selected remixes * Atomic Babies \\"Cetch Da' Monkey\\" * Boom Boom Satellites \\"4 a Moment of Silence\\" * Banco De Gaia \\"How Much Reality Can You Take\\" * Bush \\"Insect Kin\\" * Consolidated \\"Butyric Acid\\" * David Bowie \\"Pallas Athena\\" * Deepsky \\"Stargazer\\" * Depeche Mode \\"Rush\\" * D.H.S. \\"House of God\\" * Empirion \\"Narcotic Influence\\" * Nine Inch Nails \\"Closer (Deviation)\\" * Nine Inch Nails \\"The Perfect Drug\\" * Scorn \\"Silver Rain Fell\\" * Solypsis \\"Perpetually Out Of Control\\" * The Shamen \\"Ebeneezer Goode\\", \\"Hyperreal\\" * The Young Gods \\"Kissing the Sun\\" * Tower of Power \\"What Is Hip\\" * Twilight Circus Dub Sound System \\"Highway\\" * Silver Apples \\"Lovefingers\\" References External links *Official website *Tapelab - more MBM/Jack Dangers material incl. unreleased and demo downloads *Vintage Synth Explorer Analog Artist Feature - MBM kit list and further info, incl. streaming clips *Brainwashed.com page *Interview 1992 - Industrial strength zine Category:English electronic music groups Category:English techno music groups Category:British industrial music groups Category:Intelligent dance musicians Category:Nothing Records artists Category:Ableton Live users Category:Musical groups established in 1987 Category:Trip hop groups Category:Alternative hip hop groups Category:English hip hop groups Category:Wax Trax!

Though it was introduced during the \\"Recreation Fee Demonstration Program\\" (Fee-Demo) which ended on November 21, 2004, the Forest Service continues to administer the program, nearly unchanged, under the Federal Lands and Recreation Enhancement Act. This act, derisively dubbed by some as the \\"Recreation Access Tax\\" (RAT), was passed in December 2004 as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill. * Angeles National Forest * Cleveland National Forest * Los Padres National Forest * San Bernardino National Forest It is the local element of the controversial national Recreational Fee Demonstration Program system that imposes fees on the public to use public lands. The Legislative Counsel of California has determined that the National Forest Service may not cite cars for parking on state highways within national forests unless there is evidence that the occupants have used the forest for recreational purposes (for example, the occupants have been observed entering the forest). The National Forest Service invites those who feel they have been cited unjustly to write to an address on the citation to appeal. This determination was made after a large number of incidents occurred where property owners were cited for parking on their own property, in communities completely contained in the San Bernardino National Forest. Passes may be purchased for annual or day use online or from visitor centers and local merchants. Currently, the fee for a day pass is $5, and the fee for an annual pass $30. A second vehicle pass is also available for $5 with the purchase of an annual pass. Violators usually receive a \\"Notice of Noncompliance\\" and may clear the notice by purchasing a pass after the violation, paying online, or sending in a check or money order to the address in the envelope provided. Punishment of noncompliant individuals has been rare. In theory, use of the forests for non-recreational, First Amendment purposes does not require an Adventure Pass. In addition, using the restroom, stretching, or taking a picture is not a violation. After passage of the Recreational Enhancement Act in 2004, Adventure Passes are now only required at designated High Impact Recreational Areas. However, in fact most areas that previously required a parking pass still require one. To avoid a fine, a wise hiker will telephone a Forest Service office or check the maps of High Impact Recreational Areas online of the individual forests to determine in advance his or her permit needs, since adequate signage pertaining to the need for an Adventure Pass is not yet common. Although supposedly many areas do not require the pass, most of these locations are less convenient to populated areas and can be accessed only from areas that do require a pass.  Controversy  The continued collection of fees for use of the National Forest Lands remains controversial since the 9th circuit court of appeals ruled in February 2012 in the case Adams v. National Forest Service, that \\"The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (\\"REA\\")\\", the authority under which the fee structure was enacted, \\"prohibits the United States Forest Service from charging fees \\"[s]olely for parking\\". In spite of this clear prohibition, what many consider to be \\"parking only\\" fees are still required at numerous locations in the San Bernardino and Angeles National Forests as well as other National Forest Locations. The ruling stated that while fees are allowed in certain instances, the \\"fee\\" sites must conform to the following requirements as listed below: * (A) that provides significant opportunities for outdoor recreation; * (B) that has substantial Federal investments; * (C) where fees can be efficiently collected; and * (D) that contains all of the following amenities: * (i) Designated developed parking. * (ii) A permanent toilet facility. * (iii) A permanent trash receptacle. * (iv) Interpretive sign, exhibit, or kiosk. * (v) Picnic tables. * (vi) Security services. The Forest Service \\"maintains that the latter part of ¬ß 6802(d)(1)(A), which prohibits fees \\"solely for . . . picnicking along roads or trailsides,\\" clearly permits fees for road or trailside picnics that take place within a larger area (delineated by the Forest Service) if that larger area offers amenities\\". The Court rejected such an interpretation of the REA statute stating: \\"Because this reading is so illogical, we will consider another interpretation of the agency's position. Perhaps the Forest Service is really saying that a fee is \\"[s]olely for parking\\" when imposed in a location where a visitor has no option to do something else, whether or not that \\"something else\\" is an amenity required by the statute.\\" The Court further went on to illustrate: \\"Consider what would happen if a restaurant-goer inspected his bill and noticed an unexpected charge. If told that the fee was for ten bottles of wine that the patron's group neither ordered nor drank, the patron would rightly be outraged. He would not find much solace in a waiter's explanation that the wine cellar contained ten bottles, which the patron could have ordered if he wished.\\" The Court clarified the motive behind such reasoning: \\"By ignoring the plain text, the Forest Service arrives at an interpretation that would enable an end-run around the clear statutory restrictions. If the REA gave the agency complete discretion to dictate a fee's so-called purpose, then the agency could entirely evade the prohibition on parking fees by simply declaring that its fees are \\"for\\" something else too. At any of the places where subsection (f) contemplates recreation fees, it is possible for a visitor to do something more than park a car‚Äîtake photos of a volcano, make a cell phone call, chew a piece of gum‚Äîand a visitor must use a facility or service to be subject to a subsection (g) fee. Therefore, the agency could simply say that its parking fee is also \\"for\\" those other activities. Because the REA has a plain meaning that does not lead to an absurd result, we have no need to afford deference to the agency's competing, nonsensical interpretation.\\" The court then concluded: \\"...the REA unambiguously prohibits the Forest Service from charging fees... for recreational visitors who park a car, then camp at undeveloped sites, picnic along roads or trailsides, or hike through the area without using the facilities and services.\\" In spite of this ruling the fees continue to be collected.

It is known as The Lady of the Lakes. It was built in 1870 in Victorian style, originally as a boarding house, and overlooks Lake Rosseau. It was built by Thomas Aitken after he converted his home (which he bought in 1860 after moving from Scotland) and remained in family hands after his death in 1919 until 1981 when it was acquired by an investment group.https://sideroadsofmuskoka.wordpress.com/fall/secrets-of-windermere/ The then-127-year-old Windermere House burned to the ground during the filming of The Long Kiss Goodnight in February 1996. Some suspect that the production equipment lights were to blame for the fire, others say it was a short circuit, but neither explanation was proven and it remains unsolved to this day. The Windermere House was rebuilt and restored to its original glory in spring 1997. The boat house and marina were also rebuilt. The House includes several restaurants and a pub which survived the fire and is a popular dining destination for both people in town or tourists who stop in during the summer months. Behind the house is an 18-hole golf course which is also popular during the summer months. There is also an outdoor pool, tennis court, playground, church, marina, and a beach at which families can swim and play. The Cottages at Windermere House were introduced in 2009 and represent the newest and most luxurious fractional ownership resort in Ontario. The first phase of the projects features 12 lakefront cottages in an exclusive and private enclave.

The town has about 3,000 inhabitants. It is the capital of a commune in Gosty≈Ñ County. History Old arcaded house at the Market Square Poniec dates back to the 10th century, when it was part of the emerging Polish state. The oldest known mention comes from 1108. It was granted town rights before 1309. Crafts, especially clothmaking, developed and the town prospered until the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1655‚Äì1660. The Battle of Poniec occurred nearby on 28 October 1704 during the Great Northern War. Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary After the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793 it was annexed by Prussia. Regained by Poles in 1807, it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia. The local population was subjected to harsh Germanisation policies, however local Poles established various organizations, including a local branch of the \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Polish Gymnastic Society. Many inhabitants took part in the Greater Poland uprising (1918‚Äì19), after which Poniec was reintegrated with Poland in 1919, shortly after it regained independence. During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, German troops entered the town on 6 September 1939. The Polish population was subjected to arrests, executions and expulsions. In the following months, many residents were imprisoned in the town hall. On 21 October 1939 the Germans carried out a public execution of local Poles.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939.

First Polish families were expelled in December 1939. Many inhabitants were taken to forced labour or murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The town was captured by the Soviets in January 1945 and afterwards restored to Poland.

Soon after starting the race, his ship began taking on water and he wrote it would probably sink in heavy seas. He secretly abandoned the race while reporting false positions, in an attempt to appear to complete a circumnavigation without actually doing so. His ship's log books, found after his disappearance, suggest that the stress he was under, and an associated psychological deterioration, possibly led to his suicide. Crowhurst's convoluted, and ultimately tragic participation in the race has exerted a fascination over subsequent generations of commentators and artists and has inspired a number of books, stage plays, and films, among the latter a factual 2006 documentary Deep Water, and the films Crowhurst (2017) and The Mercy (2018), in which his part is played by the actors Justin Salinger and Colin Firth, respectively. His innovative but ill-prepared boat, the \\"Teignmouth Electron\\", ended its days as a dive boat in the Caribbean, and its decaying remains can still be found in the dunes above a beach in the Cayman Islands. Early life Crowhurst was born in 1932 in Ghaziabad, British India. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father worked in the Indian railways. During her pregnancy, his mother had longed for a daughter, and Crowhurst was dressed as a girl until the age of seven. After India gained its independence, his family moved back to England. The family's retirement savings were invested in an Indian sporting goods factory, which later burned down during rioting after the Partition of India. Crowhurst's father died in 1948. Due to family financial problems, he was forced to leave school early and started a five-year apprenticeship at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airfield. In 1953 he received a Royal Air Force commission as a pilot, but was asked to leave in 1954 for reasons that remain unclear, and was subsequently commissioned into the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 1956. After leaving the Army in the same year owing to a disciplinary incident, Crowhurst eventually moved to Bridgwater, where he started a business called Electron Utilisation. He was active in his local community as a member of the Liberal Party and was elected to Bridgwater Borough Council. =Business ventures= Crowhurst, a weekend sailor, designed and built a radio direction finder called the Navicator, a handheld device that allowed the user to take bearings on marine and aviation radio beacons. While he did have some success selling his navigational equipment, his business began to fail. In an effort to gain publicity, he started trying to gain sponsors to enter the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. His main sponsor was English entrepreneur Stanley Best, who had invested heavily in Crowhurst's failing business. Once committed to the race, Crowhurst mortgaged both his business and home against Best's continued financial support, placing himself in a grave financial situation. The Golden Globe Race The route of the Golden Globe Race The Golden Globe Race was inspired by Francis Chichester's successful single-handed round-the-world voyage, stopping in Sydney. The considerable publicity his achievement garnered led a number of sailors to plan the next logical step ‚Äì a non-stop, single-handed, round-the-world sail. The Sunday Times had sponsored Chichester, with highly profitable results, and was interested in being involved with the first non-stop circumnavigation, but it had the problem of not knowing which sailor to sponsor. The solution was to promote the Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world race, open to all comers, with automatic entry. That was in contrast to other races of the time, for which entrants were required to demonstrate their single-handed sailing ability prior to entry.A Voyage for Madmen, by Peter Nichols; page 17. Harper Collins, 2001. Entrants were required to start between 1 June and 31 October 1968, to pass through the Southern Ocean in summer.A Voyage for Madmen, page 30. The prizes offered were the Golden Globe trophy for the first single-handed circumnavigation, and a ¬£5,000 cash prize for the fastest. This was a considerable sum then, equivalent to almost ¬£80,000 in 2019. The other contestants were Robin Knox-Johnston, Nigel Tetley, Bernard Moitessier, Chay Blyth, John Ridgway, William King, Alex Carozzo and Lo√Øck Fougeron. \\"Tahiti\\" Bill Howell, a noted multihull sailor and competitor in the 1964 and 1968 OSTAR races, originally signed up as an entrant but did not actually race. Crowhurst hired Rodney Hallworth, a crime reporter for the Daily Mail and then the Daily Express, as his public relations officer. =Crowhurst's boat and preparations= The boat Crowhurst built for the trip, Teignmouth Electron, was a modified trimaran designed by Californian Arthur Piver.Tomalin and Hall, The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst\\" At the time, this was an unproven type of boat for a voyage of such length. Trimarans have the potential to sail much more quickly than monohulled sailboats, but early designs in particular could be very slow if overloaded, and had considerable difficulty sailing close to the wind. Trimarans are popular with many sailors for their stability, but if capsized (for example by a rogue wave), they are virtually impossible to right, though crews have lived for months with a boat in the inverted position and ultimately survived. To improve the safety of the boat, Crowhurst had planned to add an inflatable buoyancy bag on the top of the mast to prevent capsizing; the bag would be activated by water sensors on the hull designed to detect an impending capsize. This innovation would hold the mast horizontal on the surface of the water, and a clever arrangement of pumps would allow him to flood the uppermost outer hull, which would (in conjunction with wave action) pull the boat upright. His scheme was to prove these devices by sailing round the world with them, then go into business manufacturing the system. However, Crowhurst had a very short time in which to build and equip his boat while securing financing and sponsors for the race. In the end, all of his safety devices were left uncompleted; he planned to complete them while under way. Also, many of his spares and supplies were left behind in the confusion of the final preparations. To top all this, Crowhurst had never sailed on a trimaran before taking delivery of his boat several weeks before the beginning of the race. On October 13, experienced sailor Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden, volunteered to accompany Crowhurst on his last leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst had fallen into the water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard Teignmouth Electron, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the rubber dinghy. Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor before the start of the race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose. Eden said, \\"We had to keep leaning over the counter to do up the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business. I told Crowhurst he should get the fixings welded if he wanted it to survive a longer trip!\\" Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was \\"certainly nippy.\\" Eden reported that Crowhurst's sailing techniques were good, \\"But I felt his navigation was a mite slapdash. I prefer, even in the Channel, to know exactly where I am. He didn't take too much bother with it, merely jotting down figures on a few sheets of paper from time to time.\\" After struggling against westerlies and having to tack out into the Channel twice, they arrived at 2.30 pm on 15 October, where an enthusiastic BBC film crew started filming Eden in the belief he was Crowhurst. There were 16 days to get ready before the race's deadline on 31 October. =Departure and deception= Crowhurst left from Teignmouth, Devon, on the last day permitted by the rules: 31 October 1968. He encountered immediate problems with his boat, his equipment, and his lack of open-ocean sailing skills and experience. In the first few weeks he was making less than half of his planned speed. According to his logs, he gave himself only 50/50 odds of surviving the ocean assuming that he was able to complete some of the boat's safety features before reaching the dangerous Southern Ocean. Crowhurst was thus faced with the choice of either quitting the race and facing financial ruin and humiliation or continuing to an almost certain death in his unseaworthy, disappointing boat. Over the course of November and December 1968, the hopelessness of his situation pushed him into an elaborate deception. He shut down his radio with a plan to loiter in the South Atlantic for several months while the other boats sailed the Southern Ocean, falsify his navigation logs, then slip back in for the return leg to England. As last- place finisher, he assumed his false logs would not receive the same scrutiny as those of the winner. The approximate positions of the racers on 19 January 1969, including Crowhurst's claimed, assumed and actual positions. Since leaving, Crowhurst had been deliberately ambiguous in his radio reports of his location. Starting on 6 December 1968, he continued reporting vague but false positions; rather than continuing to the Southern Ocean, he sailed erratically in the southern Atlantic Ocean and stopped once in South America to make repairs to his boat, in violation of the rules. A great deal of the voyage was spent in radio silence, while his supposed position was inferred by extrapolation based on his earlier reports. By early December, based on his false reports, he was being cheered worldwide as the likely winner of the fastest circumnavigation prize, though Francis Chichester privately expressed doubts about the plausibility of Crowhurst's progress.Eakin, pp. 167-168. After rounding the tip of South America in early February, Moitessier had made a dramatic decision in March to drop out of the race and to sail on towards Tahiti. On 22 April 1969, Robin Knox-Johnston was the first to complete the race, leaving Crowhurst supposedly in the running against Tetley for second to finish, and possibly still able to beat Knox-Johnston's time, due to his later starting date. In reality, Tetley was far in the lead, having long ago passed within of Crowhurst's hiding place; but believing himself to be running neck- and neck with Crowhurst, Tetley pushed his failing boat, also a Piver trimaran, to the breaking point, and had to abandon ship on 30 May. The pressure on Crowhurst had therefore increased, since he now looked certain to win the \\"elapsed time\\" race. If he appeared to have completed the fastest circumnavigation, his log books would be closely examined by experienced sailors, including the experienced and sceptical Chichester, and the deception would probably be exposed. It is also likely that he felt guilty about undermining Tetley's genuine circumnavigation so near its completion. He had by this time begun to make his way back as if he had rounded Cape Horn. Crowhurst ended radio transmissions on June 29. The last logbook entry is dated 1 July. Teignmouth Electron was found adrift, unoccupied, on July 10. = Mental condition and final philosophical writings = Crowhurst's behaviour as recorded in his logs indicates a complex and troubled psychological state. His commitment to fabricating the voyage reports seems incomplete and self-defeating, as he reported unrealistically fast progress that was sure to arouse suspicion. By contrast, he spent many hours painstakingly constructing false log entries, often more difficult to complete than real entries due to the celestial navigation research required. The last several weeks of his log entries, once he was facing the real possibility of winning the prize, showed increasing irrationality. His biographers, Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall, believe that faced with a choice between two impossible situations‚Äîeither admit his fraud and then face public shame and likely financial ruin, or return home to a fraudulent hero's reception, and then have to live with the guilt and possible subsequent unmasking‚ÄîCrowhurst descended into a \\"classical paranoia\\", a \\"psychotic disorder in which deluded ideas are built into a complex, intricate structure\\";Tomalin & Hall (2016 edition), p. 230 others, including practising clinical psychologist Geoff Powter, who included a chapter devoted to Crowhurst in his book \\"Strange and Dangerous Dreams: The Fine Line Between Adventure and Madness\\", have postulated that Crowhurst may have suffered from undiagnosed bipolar disorder, which, accentuated by his eventual psychologically fraught situation, could account for his apparent alternation between \\"manic\\" and \\"depressed\\" episodes as evident from the later entries in his logbooks.Geoff Powter, 2006: Strange and Dangerous Dreams: The Fine Line Between Adventure and Madness. The Mountaineers Books, Seattle, 245 pp. On 24 June, he began to document these thoughts in a new set of writings in his second logbook, entitled \\"Philosophy\\".Tomalin & Hall, chapters 18-20 Although rambling and incoherent at times, he was attempting to set down, for the benefit of mankind, a \\"revelation\\" or new understanding that he believed he had discovered regarding the relationship between man and the universe. Life, as experienced by man, was a \\"game\\", overseen by \\"cosmic beings\\", apparently God (or several gods) and the Devil, who set the rules by which \\"the game\\" was played. However man could, by an effort of will, become one such \\"second generation cosmic being\\" himself, and thereby withdraw from \\"the game\\" on his own terms if he so wished, and enter a world of \\"abstract intelligence\\" (the realm of gods) in which he would have no need for his body, or any of the other trappings of daily life. At one point he wrote that this \\"revelation\\" made him happy: whereas at other points his writings documenting mental arguments‚Äîwith himself, with Albert Einstein, or with God‚Äîreveal a tortured soul on the brink of self destruction. While suicide is not explicitly mentioned as an escape route, Tomalin and Hall believe that Crowhurst (whether or not he was admitting it to himself) was groping towards this eventuality with phrases such as \\"The quick are quick, and the dead are dead. That is the judgement of God. I could not have endured the terrible anguish and meaningless waiting, in fact.\\", as well as \\"Man is forced to certain conclusions by virtue of his mistakes.\\" He continued his writings for a week, eventually amounting to more than 25,000 words.Tomalin & Hall (2016 edition), p. 203 At 10 a.m. on 1 July (by his own reckoning, since in his meditations he had omitted to wind his chronometer and had to subsequently re-start it), Crowhurst commenced what Tomalin and Hall believed to be his \\"final confession\\", also incorporating (in their view) a count of hours, minutes and seconds towards the time at which he had decided that he would end \\"the game\\" by committing suicide. His observations over the next 80 minutes are generally cryptic and/or incomplete, but include hints such as: It is unclear from the spacing whether \\"11 20 40\\" was the time of his last entry, or whether it runs on from the preceding wording as his intended time for his ultimate action. Likewise, while the phrase \\"IT IS THE MERCY\\" is obscure, most commentators have accepted that it signifies his relief that, at last, he is leaving an unbearable situation.Michael Bender, 2013: \\"Yachting and madness.\\" Journal for Maritime Research 15 (1): 83-93. doi:10.1080/21533369.2013.783161Christian Lynn: Diving into the Depths of ‚ÄòThe Mercy‚Äô ‚Äì James Marsh (The VH Interview). Vulturehound (vulturehound.co.uk), 30 May 2018. Tomalin and Hall conjecture that included in his last writings (not all reproduced above) were sentences that cover Crowhurst's internal debate over whether or not to leave the evidence of his actual, rather than faked, journey for posterity to see, and that he decided that the former was the better course; in the event, it was the \\"true\\" logbook that was left behind, and the \\"fake\\" one (if it ever existed) disappeared, along with the vessel's chronometer (its case was found empty), and Crowhurst himself. The disappearance of the vessel's chronometer (clock), apparently following Crowhurst's final diary entry, remains unexplained. = Disappearance and presumed death = Crowhurst's last log entry was on 1 July 1969; it is assumed that he then either fell or jumped overboard and drowned. The state of the boat gave no indication that it had been overrun by a rogue wave, or that any accident had occurred which might have caused Crowhurst to fall overboard. From his apparent state of mind as indicated by his most recent logbook entries and philosophical statements, it seems likely that he deliberately decided to take his own life, possibly in an effort to become a \\"second generation cosmic being\\" according to his own delusion (and thereupon have no further need for his earthly body), although the possibility that he met with some sort of accident, intending to return to continue writing in his logbook, cannot be completely dismissed. Three log books (two navigational logs and a radio log) and a large mass of other papers were left on his boat to communicate his philosophical ideas and to reveal his actual navigational course during the voyage. The boat was found with the mizzen sail up. Although his biographers, Tomalin and Hall, discounted the possibility that some sort of food poisoning contributed to his mental deterioration, they acknowledged that there is insufficient evidence to rule it, or several other hypotheses, out. They also acknowledged that other hypotheses could be constructed, involving further deception‚Äîsuch as that Crowhurst had perhaps faked his own death, and somehow survived‚Äîbut that these were extremely unlikely. Clare Crowhurst, Donald's widow, strongly disputed the theory put forward by Tomalin and Hall regarding the circumstances of her husband's deception and demise, accusing them of mixing fiction with fact. In a letter to The Times published on July 10, 1970, she contended that there was no evidence that her husband had intended to write a fake logbook (none was in fact found), that his death could equally have been as the result of misadventure (such as an accident while climbing the mast, which a logbook entry showed that he intended to do before June 30), and also that Tomalin believed that \\"all heroes are neurotics, and starting off with this theory, he has sought to prove it by the history of Donald from the earliest age until his death\\".The Times, letters to the editor, July 10, 1970: Profile of Donald Crowhurst: his widow's protest. Nevertheless, later commentators have agreed with Tomalin and Hall's general conclusions, that Crowhurst's long sojourn alone at sea, coupled with his being placed in an impossible dilemma, led to his eventual psychological breakdown and resulting probable suicide.Glin Bennet, 1974: \\"Psychological breakdown at sea: hazards of singlehanded ocean sailing.\\" British Journal of Medical Psychology 47: 189-210. doi:10.1111/j.2044-8341.1974.tb02284.xJames Lill, 1978: \\"The language of adventure\\". The Georgia Review, 32(4): 844-856. Aftermath =After the race= Part of one of the bows of the trimaran Teignmouth Electron. When photographed in March 2011, little identifiable as a boat remained of the wreck above a beach on Cayman Brac. Showing the name Teignmouth and part of the hole where a souvenir hunter has removed Electron. Teignmouth Electron was found adrift and abandoned on 10 July 1969 by the RMV Picardy, at latitude 33 degrees 11 minutes North and longitude 40 degrees 26 minutes West. News of Crowhurst's disappearance led to an air and sea search in the vicinity of the boat and its last estimated course. Examination of his recovered logbooks and papers revealed the attempt at deception, his mental breakdown and eventual presumed suicide. This was reported in the press at the end of July, creating a media sensation. Prior to the deception being revealed, Robin Knox-Johnston donated his ¬£5,000 winnings for fastest circumnavigation to Donald Crowhurst's widow and children. Nigel Tetley was awarded a consolation prize and built a new trimaran. Teignmouth council considered a proposal to exhibit the boat, charging visitors 2/6d per head, with profits to go to Crowhurst's wife and four children.The Straits Times, 15 July 1969, Page 3 Teignmouth Electron was later taken to Jamaica and was sold several times, being re-purposed and re-fitted, first as a cruise boat in Montego Bay and later as a dive boat in the Cayman Islands, before being hauled out following a minor incident in 1983 but later damaged by a hurricane and never repaired. The boat still lies decaying on the southwest shore of Cayman Brac.Cayman Net News, 17 June 2005: Brac's land wreck makes it to TV fame =Reputation and historic re-appraisal= Had Crowhurst finished the race, his fake coordinates would undoubtedly have been exposed and he would have been treated as a hoaxer on a grand scale, in addition to being in probable financial ruin. From his surviving logbooks it is unclear whether his eventual presumed suicide was to avoid having to confront such a situation and/or to seek an \\"honourable\\" exit without disrespecting his family, or whether his final metaphysical ramblings - which could also be interpreted as a mental instability - led to his abandoning the world and his body in search of a more spiritual objective. Either way, near contemporary accounts of his actions were not particularly sympathetic; the 1970 book \\"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst\\" by two Sunday Times journalists is described as \\"largely unflattering\\" in a recent account.Simon Parkin: Colin Firth on Donald Crowhurst, the sailor lost at sea in a boat made in Norfolk (Eastern Daily Press, 08 February 2018) Over the intervening decades, however, history has been somewhat more kind to Crowhurst and his actions, viewing him as more of a well intentioned but tragic figure, who became caught up in a situation initially of his own making but which he could ultimately not control; in the same article, \\"The Mercy\\" (movie) director James Marsh says: \\"He made a pretty good go at sailing round the world - he stayed out in the ocean for the best part of seven months so all in all, he achieved much more than people ever thought he could, he just didn't achieve what his objective was. It was a case of over-reach, it was hubris and that is what caused the tragedy of his demise.\\" Actor Colin Firth, who played Crowhurst in \\"The Mercy\\", had this to say: Rachel Weisz, who plays Crowhurst's wife Clare in the same movie, says: Focusing more on Crowhurst's apparent mental state after 243 days alone at sea, Jonathan Rabin writes: Despite the slightly deprecating tone noted by others in Tomalin and Hall's comprehensive account, perhaps a fair assessment can still be accorded to Crowhurst via these two journalists, who wrote in 1970: In popular culture =Movies and documentaries= * Donald Crowhurst ‚Äì Sponsored for Heroism (1970) a BBC TV Film written and narrated by Paul Foot and directed by Colin Thomas * Horse Latitudes was a 1975 television movie about Crowhurst (called Philip Stockton in the film).Horse Latitudes IMDb.

Blodig was the first to successfully climb all Alpine peaks of over 4000 meters, completing his final summit around 1911.Rawlinson, A. K. The Climbers Club Journal, 1957, pp. 108-10. He wrote about these climbs in his book Die Viertausender der Alpen (The Four-Thousanders of the Alps), first published in 1923. Mountaineering Life Born in Vienna, Blodig spent his early years in Graz, climbing Mount Triglav while still in his teens. At the age of twenty he climbed Monte Rosa, guided by Christian Ranggetiner, and by twenty-three he had made non-guided ascents of the Dufourspitze, Zumsteinspitze, and Weisshorn. Between 1890 and 1911 he succeeded in climbing the remaining peaks to achieve all those summits that were at that time listed as being over 4,000 m in height. These achievements included first ascents of the Brouillard Ridge on Mont Blanc as well as the first traverse of the Rochefort Ridge. Among his alpine climbing partners were Ludwig Purtscheller and the Alpine artist Edward Theodore Compton.Helmut Dumler and Willi P. Burkhardt, The High Mountains of the Alps, London: Diadem, 1994. Around 1911 Blodig was part of a regular mountaineering meeting at Pen-y-Pass in Wales, among whom was George Mallory. Blodig observed Mallory expertly tackling a crux pitch of a very difficult ice chimney. Even though all the climbing friends present were impressed by Mallory's skill as a climber, Blodig later observed rather prophetically about Mallory that: \\"that young man will not be alive for long!\\" In 1932, and at the age of 73, Blodig undertook solo ascents of the Aiguille du Jardin and the Grande Rocheuse in order to achieve summits that had subsequently been added to the recognised list of 4,000 m peaks since his 1911 achievement.

Francis (January 24, 1919 ‚Äì January 15, 1973) was an American actor, writer, producer and director. He was best known for his film trilogy consisting of The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961), The Skydivers (1963) and Red Zone Cuba (1966), all three of which were filmed in the general vicinity of Santa Clarita, California. Hallmarks of Francis' films include preoccupation with light aircraft and parachuting, coffee or cigarettes serving as props or centers of conversation and vigilante-style gunning down of suspects without trial at the films' conclusions. Francis and his films have gained a cult status as a result of their appearances on the comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000, where they became infamous for their poor production values, repetitive plot devices, meandering and incomprehensible storylines, and stilted acting. Some critics have characterized Francis as being the worst director of all-time, even suggesting that he may surpass Ed Wood in terms of ineptitude.https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/12/coleman-francis-the- real-worst-director-in-film-hi.html Early life Francis in 1937. Francis was born in Greer County, Oklahoma in 1919. He was the son of William F. Francis and Scytha Estes. During the Great Depression, he moved to Texas. Career In the 1940s, Francis headed for Hollywood to start an acting career. He played minor parts in several films from the late 1940s to early 1970s, often without credit, including Blondie's Reward, Scarlet Angel, The Girl in White, This Island Earth, She Couldn't Say No, Twilight for the Gods, P. J. and Motorpsycho. 1958 brought his first credited role, Stakeout on Dope Street, where he played a detective. His last work in the film industry was in 1970, when he played a drunk in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. In 1959, Francis formed a partnership with Anthony \\"Tony\\" Cardoza, a welder by trade, and together they created three films: The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961), The Skydivers (1963) and Red Zone Cuba (1966). Francis wrote and directed the films, while Cardoza handled production duties. Personal life Francis married Barbara Francis, and while the two had divorced prior to the filming of The Beast of Yucca Flats, she was cast as Lois Radcliffe in Beast and appeared as the wife of a spectator (played by Coleman) in its follow-up, The Skydivers. They had two sons, Alan and Ronald, who appeared as Art and Randy Radcliffe in The Beast of Yucca Flats and the spectator's sons in The Skydivers. Death Francis died in California on January 15, 1973 at the age of 53. Though arteriosclerosis is listed as the official cause of death, Cardoza says Francis' body was found in the back of a station wagon at the Vine Street Ranch Market with \\"a plastic bag over his head and a tube going into his mouth or around his throat\\". Francis is interred at the Columbarium of Remembrance in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Legacy After fading into obscurity for decades, Francis' three directed films gained cult status after being featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the mid-1990s.

The title was created by King William I of the Netherlands for Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington as a victory title in recognition of defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Duke of Wellington and all his descendants along male line belong to Dutch and Belgian nobility, in which all the descendant dukes carry the title of \\"Prince of Waterloo\\" with the style \\"Serene Highness\\" (). The rest of his family retain the Dutch honorific Jonkheer or Jonkvrouw. Common law is that nobility and accompanying titles inherit along male line. Estate of the Prince In addition to this title, the Dutch king also granted Wellington of land and a yearly donation of 20,000 guilders. To this day the Dukes of Wellington retain the title Prince of Waterloo,Cash Talk - TIME and enjoy an annual income of around ¬£100,000 from the longstanding tenants occupying the land. Owing to the establishment of the separate Kingdom of Belgium in 1831, the title (being Dutch) and the land (located in Belgium) became separated. After the Belgian independence the donation was by the Treaty of London included in the public debt to be assumed by the new Kingdom of Belgium. The land held by the Prince of Waterloo has recently (2001) come under pressure from retired Belgian senator Jean-Emile Humblet.The Mediadrome - News - Waterloo Rents In 1817, the government in what is now Belgium struck a deal to pay the duke ¬£1,600 a year in return for the proceeds of sales of timber which the duke wanted to clear from the forested land. Until 1988, successive dukes enjoyed this annual payment, but the then Prince of Waterloo, Valerian Wellesley, 8th Duke of Wellington, agreed to forgo the payment in exchange for outright ownership of of the to which he has rights. But some Belgian taxpayers, led by Humblet, say the deal does not reflect the value of the land and draw attention to the wider issues surrounding the original agreement, contending that Belgium was effectively coerced into accepting the terms of the original agreement, because it could not afford to offend Britain.Battle lines drawn at WaterlooBattle over legacy of Waterloo Also, in 2009 a Member of Parliament from Vlaams Belang questioned the Minister of Finance, Didier Reynders about the grant. Reynders replied that this grant is part of the international obligations of Belgium under the Treaty of London and that he had no intention of reneging on the obligation, as all the Dukes have faithfully fulfilled their obligations.Bulletin of the Chamber of Representatives 22 June 2009, p97 (in Dutch and French) List of Princes of Waterloo (1815‚Äìpresent) * Arthur Wellesley, 1st Prince of Waterloo (1769‚Äì1852) from 1815 * Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Prince of Waterloo (1807‚Äì1884) from 1852 * Henry Wellesley, 3rd Prince of Waterloo (1846‚Äì1900) from 1884 * Arthur Wellesley, 4th Prince of Waterloo (1849‚Äì1934) from 1900 * Arthur (Charlie) Wellesley, 5th Prince of Waterloo (1876‚Äì1941) from 1934 * Henry (Morney) Wellesley, 6th Prince of Waterloo (1912‚Äì1943) from 1941 * Gerald (Gerry) Wellesley, 7th Prince of Waterloo (1885‚Äì1972) from 1943 * Arthur Valerian Wellesley, 8th Prince of Waterloo (1915-2014) from 1972 * Arthur Charles Wellesley, 9th Prince of Waterloo (b. 1945) from 2014 The heir apparent is the present holder's son Jonkheer Arthur Gerald Wellesley (b. 1978).

Its range includes Europe south of 62¬∞N, Russia eastwards to the Urals, Asia Minor, Iraq, Iran, North Africa and the Canary Islands. The larvae feed on grasses. Description There is marked sexual dimorphism in this species. The upperside of the male is uniformly light brown with a black ocellus centered white at the apex of the forewing, while the female has a tawny patch more or less extended around this ocella. The underside forewing is ochre- colored bordered with dark beige with the same ocelli at the apex in the male, while the hindwing is greyish to brown with a more or less orange band in the female. The males are also much more active and range far about, while females fly less and often may not move away from the area where they grew up. Description in Seitz Above dark brown: the apical ocellus minutely centred with white, being in the male bordered with dull dark yellow, and standing in the female in an ochre-yellow half band, which becomes narrower behind and does not reach the hindmargin. The upperside of the live male has often a splendid metallic gloss and bears a broad scent-patch below the cell. Underside of hindwing in the male dark brown, with a hardly perceptible middle band, in the female grey-brown, with a broad, pale, proximallv golden-brown- bordered curved band. In several forms throughout Europe Apart from the forms characterized by the disappearance of ocelli or the appearance of accessory there are firstly the albinos which have received in which the blackish ground-colour is replaced by dirty white, while the reddish yellow halfband has remained as such. In others the reddish yellow halfband on the forewing of the female is pale to ivory-white. Specimens have been described in which the band of the male is very prominent on a silky dust-grey upperside. Aberration cinerea has a bluish gloss on the dark upperside; the hindwing is strongly dentate, tinged with pink on the underside, and bears two eye-dots In hot summers one not seldom meets with specimens in which the reddish yellow colour has increased, this colour being represented by a yellowish red dusting on the apical area in the male and in the female by a yellowish red area in the disc of the hindwing.[Subspecies] hispulla Hbn. (47b) from Southern Europe, has these characteristics in a still more pronounced degree, and is, besides, generally broader-winged than the nymotypical jurtina ‚Äî fortunata Alph. (47 c) is a yet paler form. The live male has in its apical area a magnificent golden gloss on a deep black ground, in the female the ground-colour above is reduced by the extension of the reddish yellow. Moreover, the form is much larger and the basal area of the hindwing is so darkened below that the light discal band contrasts vividly.Seitz. A. in Seitz, A. ed. Band 1: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Tagfalter, 1909, 379 Seiten, mit 89 kolorierten Tafeln (3470 Figuren) A variable number of smaller eyespots are usually found on the hindwing undersides. These may number up to twelve per butterfly, with up to six on each wing, but sometimes none. The factors that govern polymorphism in this trait are not resolved, although a number of theories have been proposed (Stevens 2005). On the other hand, the evolutionary significance of the upperwing eyespots is more obvious: The more active males have a markedly more cryptic upperside pattern, whereas the females have more opportunity to present their eyespots in a sudden display of colors and patterns that presumably startle predators so the butterfly has a better chance of escaping. Some specimens are bi-pupilled. File:ButterflyOnFlower.jpgManiola jurtina female on buttercup flower.

Most problematic is the cryptic species complex of Maniola (Maniola telmessia, Maniola nurag, Maniola chia, Maniola halicarnassus and Maniola cypricola). Plate 85 Description of egg, larva and pupa The egg, laid on a blade of grass as shown (Plate 85), is upright and ribbed; the top is flattened, with an impressed ring thereon. Color, whitish green inclining to brownish yellow as it matures, and marked with purplish brown. The caterpillar is bright green, clothed with short whitish hairs; there is a darker line down the back, and a diffused white stripe on each side above the reddish spiracles; the anal points are white. Head rather darker green, hairy. The chrysalis is pale green, marked with brownish on the wing covers, the thorax is spotted with blackish, and the points on the body are brownish. Suspended, and with the old skin attached. (South, 1906). Food plants Recorded larval food plants include rough meadow grass (Poa trivialis), smooth meadow grass (Poa pratensis), Festuca species, bents (Agrostis species), and cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), downy oat-grass and Helictotrichon pubescens. Less specific records of Poa, Bromus, Festuca, Milium, Brachypodium, Lolium, Avena, Alopecurus and Anthoxanthum. Adults feed on nectar from a wide spectrum of plants including Centaurea, Cirsium, Leontodon, Erica, Rubus, Heracleum, Eupatorium, (sensu lato) Origanum, Senecio, Scabiosa, Succisa, Ligustrum and Filipendula. Flight time The meadow brown is univoltine (one generation per year) and adults emerge over a long period (spring, summer and autumn). Some individuals have a short larval development time and produce late adults. This is genetically controlled. Habitat Because of the vast distribution habitats are hard to define but broadly are forest edge, forest-steppe and meadow steppe habitats up to 2,000 m above sea level, cultivated lands (meadow, forest plantations, parks and orchards).

He was also an early inspiration for both the New Left movement and Eurocommunism in their attempt to find a \\"Third way\\" to democratic socialism. Life Bauer was born in Vienna. Having studied at the University of Vienna, he finished his PhD in Law in 1906 and published his first book, Die Sozialdemokratie und die Nationalit√§tenfrage, in 1907. Although he was politically active during his studies, his gradual rise in the Social Democratic Party of Austria began after he had finished his doctoral studies. He founded Der Kampf, the theoretical journal of the party in 1907 and between 1907 and 1914 he was secretary of the party. As one of Austria's leading \\"left\\" socialists,Bourne, J.M. Who's Who In World War One. New York: Taylor and Francis e-library, 2002. p 17. (Accessed via Google Books 2/21/11.) Bauer was able to establish himself as a likely successor to Viktor Adler as party leader. Bauer served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was captured on the Eastern Front in the early months of the First World War. He spent three years as a prisoner of war in Russia, returning to Austria in 1917. After Viktor Adler's death in 1918, Bauer became leader of the Austrian Social Democratic Party. From November 1918 to July 1919 the Austrian Social Democrats formed a coalition government with the Christian Social Party and Otto Bauer was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Despite his Marxist socialism, he had pan-Germanic and nationalist ideas (he negotiated with the Weimar government an eventual accession of Austria into Germany by March 1919 during the German Revolution)AUSTRIA WILL JOIN GERMANY SPEEDILY - Teutonic Union Will Be Proclaimed as Soon as Details Are Completed.

When Engelbert Dollfuss, with the assistance of elements of the Christian Social Party and the Heimwehr, installed an authoritarian, corporatist dictatorship in 1933, the activities of the Austrian Social Democrats were severely curtailed. Following the Social Democrats' failed uprising in February, 1934, Otto Bauer was forced into exile. He continued to organize the Austrian Social Democrats' resistance, first from Br√ºnn (Brno), Czechoslovakia, and later from Brussels, Belgium, and finally Paris. He continued his literary and theoretical work until his death. Bauer died of heart failure in Paris on 4 July 1938, aged 56, just four months after Austria had become part of the Nazi Third Reich. His sister, Ida Bauer, was a patient of Sigmund Freud, who published a famous case study about her using the pseudonym Dora.

Systems were installed in the FAA's 20 en route Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), beginning in the late 1960s. The IBM 9020A, for example, was based on the 360/50 and the 9020D used two out of three or four 360/65 processors for flight and radar data processing with two out of three 360/50 processors providing input/output capability. A maximum configuration CCC/DCC complex contained 12 IBM S/360 mainframes. Not all FAA ARTCCs (Air Route Traffic Control Centers), of which there were 20 (plus one in the UK), had the maximum configuration. This schematic shows the maximum configuration, with the mainframe boxes highlighted in blue. There were three operational variants of the 9020 system: 9020A CCC (Central Computer Complex); 9020D CCC; and 9020E DCC (Display Channel Complex). All the 9020A CCCs were attached to a non-IBM display complex, while the 9020D CCCs could be attached to either a non-IBM display complex or to the IBM 9020E DCC. The 9020A and 9020D CCCs carried out flight and radar data processing but needed an attached display complex to provide a plan view display to the air traffic controllers. Each ARTCC had a System Maintenance Monitor Console (SMMC) that brought together the status indications of the installed 9020 system(s) as well as related components, such as environmental systems and communications links. A maximum configuration CCC/DCC complex contained 12 IBM S/360 mainframes. Not all FAA ARTCCs, of which there were 20 (plus one in the UK), had the maximum configuration. Longevity and follow-on systems The 9020As and 9020Ds were in service in North America until 1989 when they were finally replaced by IBM 3083 BX1 mainframes as part of the FAA's HOST Computer System (HCS) upgrade. The 3083s in turn were replaced with IBM 9672 RA4 parallel processing servers during the FAA's Host and Oceanic Computer System Replacement (HOCSR) completed in 1999. One reason for the 1999 upgrade was concern, probably unfounded, that the IBM 3083's microcode would not operate properly in the year 2000. At least during the first phase of the upgrade, the 9672s were running the FAA's original assembly language code in System/360 emulation mode. Because of the failure of the FAA's Advanced Automation System (AAS) project, the 9020E Display Channel Complexes lasted well into the 1990s. NATS in the UK had a 9020D system in service running NAS from 1974 to 1989, at which time NAS was rehosted on to an IBM 4381 system. This system was known as the Host Computer System (HCS), and it retained the System/360 technology Peripheral Adapter Modules (PAMs) from the 9020D. The three PAMs (IBM 7289s) were switched off for the last time 27 November 1997 when their replacement (SPRINT) came into service.

Paul Liam Pritchard (born 1967) was one of the leading British climbers of the 1980s and 1990s. Pritchard was born in Bolton, and started climbing at the age of 16 in his native Lancashire. Within a year had started to repeat some of the hardest routes in the county, as well as beginning his own additions. He made many ascents of outstanding problems in the Wilton Quarries, Anglezarke and Hoghton as well as playing a pivotal role in the early development of both Craig y Longridge and Thorn Crag and engaging in extensive exploration of Malham Cove. In 1986 he moved to Llanberis in North Wales, climbing extensively on the slate of the Llanberis quarries and on the sea cliffs at Gogarth, situated between North Stack and South Stack, near Holyhead. He gained a reputation for climbing hard and very poorly protected routes such as Super Calabrese (E8 6b) at Gogarth, still considered one of the most serious routes in the UK. In 1990, he began mountaineering, and subsequently climbed many difficult mountain routes around the world. This also included multiple attempts on the then unclimbed Shark's Fin on Meru Peak, in the Indian Himalayan Region. He won the 1997 Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature for his book Deep Play. On Friday 13 February 1998, Pritchard's life changed drastically when he was struck in the head by a falling boulder while attempting an ascent of the Totem Pole, a slender sea stack off the coast of Tasmania. He was rendered semiconscious, bleeding, and nearly helpless. Over the next hours a heroic rescue was effected by his partner, Celia Bull. Paul Pritchard and the Totem Pole (audio file). BBC Witness. Broadcast February 3, 2019. Retrieved February 3, 2019. He was left suffering from hemiplegia, a condition that robbed him of feeling and movement in his right side and which caused his speech and memory to suffer. Pritchard has continued to lead a challenging life even after the catastrophic injury. He has climbed Kilimanjaro, ridden a recumbent trike through Tibet to Mount Everest and took the lead rock climbing again. In 2016 Paul finally climbed the Totem Pole, 18 years after his accident In 2017 Pritchard, and 4 other people with disabilities, accomplished the first journey under human power between Australia‚Äôs extremities of altitude. On the Lowest To Highest Expedition the team members cycled from Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre (-15m) to Kosciuszko -Targangil (2228m), a distance of 2152km. Pritchard has written three books: *Deep Play (1997) is about his early climbing experiences *Totem Pole (1999) about his accident and his recovery from it *The Longest Climb (2005) continues his story of recovery He won the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature for each of the first two of these.

Since the concert hall is in the shape of a tetrahedron, it has no straight angles and, as a result, no standing waves can occur. Acoustic waves can never amplify one another in phase and are reflected by the walls under ever changing angles. The hall is exclusively used for contemporary and experimental music, such as electronic music and computer music and holds approximately 65 concerts a year, primarily by the Logos Foundation. In 2012 they were host for the ISCM World Music Days . The concert hall was built in 1990 by Godfried-Willem Raes and the Logos workgroup using steel, concrete and plate-metal.

The General Assembly was created by the first state constitution adopted in 1818. The State Senate has 59 members while the House has 118 members, each elected from single-member districts. A Senate district is formed by combining two adjacent House districts. The current General Assembly is Illinois's 101st. The General Assembly meets in the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Its session laws are generally adopted by majority vote in both houses, and upon gaining the assent of the Governor of Illinois. They are published in the official Laws of Illinois. History The Illinois General Assembly was created by the first state constitution adopted in 1818. Initially, the state did not have organized political parties, but the Democratic and Whig parties began to form in the 1830s. Future U.S. President Abraham Lincoln successfully campaigned as a member of the Whig Party to serve in the General Assembly in 1834.White, Jr., Ronald C. (2009). A. Lincoln: A Biography. Random House, Inc. , p. 59. He served four successive terms 1834‚Äì42 in the Illinois House of Representatives, supporting expanded suffrage and economic development. The Illinois Republican Party was organized at a conference held in Major's Hall in Bloomington, Illinois on May 29, 1856. Its founding members came from the former Whig Party in Illinois after its members joined with several powerful local political factions including, notably, the Independent Democrat movement of Chicago that helped elect James Hutchinson Woodworth as mayor in 1848. During the election of 1860 in which Lincoln was elected president, Illinois also elected a Republican governor and legislature, but the trials of war helped return the state legislature to the Democrats in 1861.VandeCreek, Drew E. Politics in Illinois and the Union During the Civil War (accessed May 27, 2013) The Democratic-led legislature investigated the state's war expenditures and the treatment of Illinois troops, but with little political gain. They also worked to frame a new state constitution nicknamed the \\"Copperhead constitution\\", which would have given Southern Illinois increased representation and included provisions to discourage banking and the circulation of paper currency. Voters rejected each of the constitution's provisions, except the bans on black settlement, voting and office holding. The Democratic Party came to represent skepticism in the war effort, until Illinois' Democratic leader Stephen A. Douglas changed his stance and pledged his full support to Lincoln. The Democratic Party swept the 1862 election. They passed resolutions denouncing the federal government's conduct of the war and urging an immediate armistice and peace convention in the Illinois House of Representatives, leading the Republican governor to suspend the legislature for the first time in the state's history. In 1864, Republicans swept the state legislature and at the time of Lincoln's assassination, Illinois stood as a solidly Republican state. In 1877, John W. E. Thomas was the first African American elected to the legislature. In 1922, Lottie Holman O'Neill was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, becoming the first woman to serve in the Illinois General Assembly. From 1870 to 1980, the state was divided into 51 legislative districts, each of which elected one senator and three representatives. The representatives were elected by cumulative voting, in which a voter had three votes that could be distributed to either one, two, or three candidates. This system was abolished with the Cutback Amendment in 1980. Since then, the House has been elected from 118 single-member districts formed by dividing the 59 Senate districts in half. Each senator is \\"associated\\" with two representatives. Future U.S. President Barack Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, serving there until 2004 when he was elected to the United States Senate. Terms of members Members of the House of Representatives are elected to a two-year term without term limits. Members of the Illinois Senate serve two four-year terms and one two-year term each decade. This ensures that Senate elections reflect changes made when the General Assembly is redistricted following each United States Census. To prevent complete turnovers in membership (except after an intervening Census), not all Senators are elected simultaneously. The term cycles for the Senate are staggered, with the placement of the two-year term varying from one district to another. Each district's terms are defined as 2-4-4, 4-2-4, or 4-4-2. Like House members, Senators are elected without term limits. Officers The officers of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even number year. Representatives of the House elect from its membership a Speaker and Speaker pro tempore, drawn from the majority party in the chamber. The Illinois Secretary of State convenes and supervises the opening House session and leadership vote. State senators elect from the chamber a President of the Senate, convened and under the supervision of the governor. Since the adoption of the current Illinois Constitution in 1970, the Lieutenant Governor of Illinois does not serve in any legislative capacity as Senate President, and has had its office's powers transferred to other capacities. The Illinois Auditor General is a legislative officer appointed by the General Assembly that reviews all state spending for legality. Sessions and qualifications Title page of the 1912 Laws of Illinois The General Assembly's first official working day is the second Monday of January each year, with the Secretary of State convening the House, and the governor convening the Senate.Constitution of the State of Illinois, ARTICLE IV, THE LEGISLATURE (accessed May 27, 2013) In order to serve as a member in either chamber of the General Assembly, a person must be a U.S. citizen, at least 21 years of age, and for the two years preceding his election or appointment a resident of the district which they represent. In the general election following a redistricting, a candidate for any chamber of the General Assembly may be elected from any district which contains a part of the district in which he or she resided at the time of the redistricting and reelected if a resident of the new district he represents for 18 months prior to reelection. =Restrictions= Members of the General Assembly may not hold other public offices or receive appointments by the governor, and their salaries may not be increased during their tenure. Veto powers The General Assembly has the power to override gubernatorial vetoes through a three-fifths majority vote in each chamber. The governor has different types of veto like a full veto and a reduction veto. If the governor decides that the bill needs changes, he will ask for an amendatory veto.

The city proper had 34,772 inhabitants in 2001.UMA POPULA√á√ÉO QUE SE URBANIZA, Uma avalia√ß√£o recente - Cidades, 2004 Nuno Pires Soares, Instituto Geogr√°fico Portugu√™s (Geographic Institute of Portugal) The municipality population in 2011 was 51,797,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 555.60 km¬≤. It is located in the Beiras e Serra da Estrela subregion and Beiras and Serra da Estrela Intermunicipal Community. The municipal holiday is October 20. Sometimes referred to as town of wool and snow, Covilh√£ is one of the main urban centres of the historical Beira Interior region. The proximity of the mountains offers dramatic scenery and a great environment for those fond of hiking, camping, mountain climbing and skiing. History and landmarks Santa Maria Church in Covilh√£. In the 1940s the fa√ßade was covered with tiles (azulejos). Its history dates back to the days when it was a pre-historical settlement, a shelter for Lusitanian shepherds, and a Roman fortress known as Cava Juliana or Silia Herm√≠nia. The region of Beira Interior, where the city of Covilh√£ is located, is rich in historical places. Due to its strategic potential, its mountains were used to build castles for both attack and defence purposes. Covilh√£ was granted foral in 1186 by king Sancho I of Portugal, who also built the castle walls. The old quarters of the city have narrow cobblestone streets; pedestrians are challenged permanently by the ups and downs of most of the streets in the city. A school-factory was built by Fernando de Meneses, 2nd Count of Ericeira, in 1681. On November 1, 1755, Covilh√£ was shaken by the forces of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake that destroyed part of Covilh√£'s castle walls and its large towers. A Royal Textile Factory, was established in the city by the Marquis of Pombal in 1763, and Covilh√£ was granted city status on 20 October 1870 by king Lu√≠s I of Portugal. Along the two streams that cross the city there are still remains of the old textile factories, which bear witness to the unquestionable importance of this industry for Covilh√£'s economy, once known as the \\"Portuguese Manchester\\". During the first half of the 19th century, the municipality of Covilh√£ had about 22,000 inhabitants, and in 1930 it nearly reached 50,000 inhabitants. During the 1960s, Covilh√£'s municipality surpassed 70,000 inhabitants, but the Portuguese Colonial War (1961‚Äì1974) and the generalized emigration phenomena of the 1960s to 1980s Portuguese society, its geographical location in the mountainous interior of central Portugal, increasing mechanization and the stagnation of its textile industrial sector, caused a period of decline of its population to nearly 50,000 in the 1990s. A state-run university, UBI - Universidade da Beira Interior, was founded in 1979. The city is still expanding, mainly to the flat part of the valley called Cova da Beira, where some important infrastructures such as the central hospital and the highway are located. Geography Torre, the highest point of Mainland Portugal, viewed from Penhas da Sa√∫de Covilh√£ is located in the Centro region, Cova da Beira subregion, in central Portugal; 300 km (186 mi) Northeast of Lisbon, Portugal's capital; 100 km (62 mi) East of Coimbra, the regional administrative centre; and at the bottom of the highest Portuguese mountain range, Serra da Estrela. The city of Castelo Branco is located 50 km (31 mi) to the south of Covilh√£ and the neighbouring town of Fund√£o, the largest locality in the vicinities of Covilh√£, is 20 km (12.4 mi) also to the south. The city of Covilh√£ towers between 450 and 800 metres (1,476 and 2,624 feet) above the sea level, thus the mountain landscape is ever present. The larger municipality has 555.6 km¬≤ (214.5 sq mi) of territory and includes several localities distributed across 31 civil parishes. In the municipality of Covilh√£ but outside the urban area, Penhas da Sa√∫de is one of its highest points.

The existence of the University of Beira Interior, with its degree of aeronautical engineering, as well as the local aerodrome contributed for the final decision from Aleia to develop an aerospace industry in the town.Covilh√£: Aleia vai montar avi√£o at√© agora vendido em kit e jactos portugueses em 2011 , 14th April 2008 There is a large shopping centre in Covilh√£, Serra Shopping,http://www.serrashopping.com and besides a wide variety of shops, it has hypermarket, four cinemas and many restaurants. Hypermarkets and supermarkets located in the lower part of the town include Continente (inside Serra Shopping), Intermarch√©, Pingo Doce and Lidl. The Public Market (Mercado Municipal) is another option and an opportunity to buy fresh produce directly from the producers. This town was recently chosen by the biggest telecommunications company in Portugal Portugal Telecom to there build and install one of the biggest Data Centres of Europe, with the capacity to store 30 petabytes of information. The building, opened in September 2013 has a floor area the size of thirteen football pitches. Covilh√£ is considered now the biggest town in terms of Development and new technologies. Events and recreation A view of Covilh√£ with the University of Beira Interior main library in the foreground The City Hall of Covilh√£ used to be responsible for the cultural programming of one of the movie theatres of the town which has a wide variety of activities throughout the year. Such Movie Theater is now closed. There are also various theatre companies: Teatrubi, ASTA, Teatro das Beiras and Quarta Parede that stage theatre and multimedia productions throughout the year. A theatre festival is organised by a local theatre company, Teatro das Beiras, in November. The city hosts several choirs and orchestras, like the well-known university choir and the EPABI orchestra, which is based in the building near the public garden (location has now changed to the lower parts of the city), as well as the Orquestra da Banda Filarm√≥nica.

Sporting Clube da Covilh√£, a sports club founded in 1923 in Covilh√£, is the most important sporting organization in the city. Its football (soccer) team now plays in the secondary national divisions, but in the past played in the top division. It is one of the few clubs of Portugal's interior to have played in the top division of Portuguese football. The football team plays in the Complexo Desportivo da Covilh√£, a multi-use stadium able to hold 6,125 people (all-seated). Transport The nearest airports are located in Lisbon and Porto. From these two cities, Covilh√£ can be very easily reached both by train and coach. The railway and coach stations of Covilh√£ are within a walking distance from one to the other (10 minutes walk). It is also possible to reach Covilh√£ directly by coach from abroad. Partial view of Covilh√£'s core centre with the mountains in the background Covilh√£ is located, less than 300 km from Lisbon and Porto, the two biggest cities in Portugal and just 400 km from the Spanish capital, Madrid. Several national and international bus routes pass Covilh√£, so it is easy and practical to reach almost all destinations. To reach Lisbon it takes 3.5h - 4h of journey, by bus or by train. The bus station is situated in the lower part of the city; and the railway station is near, no more than 10 minutes walking. The railway company is CP - Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses and offers various types of services. Inter City (Intercidades) train is recommended to reach Covilh√£. There are also car rental companies in the city. From Covilh√£ northwards to Guarda trains were operated by diesel motorcars. This scenic stretch of mountainous rural line provides the strategic last leg of the Beira Baixa Railway linking it to Guarda via Belmonte. However, in recent years it has been closed for modernisation and electrification. The partially completed works, originally due for completion in 2011, are sadly still on hold as of 2014 due to serious funding issues associated with the economy. This inconveniently cuts off otherwise direct rail options to destinations north of Covilh√£. A bus network ‚Äì Covibus ‚Äì covers all the urban area as well as the outskirts of the city making it easy to travel both within and outside the city limits, although the time between buses is big (not less than 1 hour). Several bus lines serve university buildings. Cabs are also an option. They are painted cream (mostly black these days) and sometimes have a roof-light to identify them. In town they use taximeters, but once outside urban boundaries the service is charged per km.

Students named this statue \\"Bud the Bird,\\" and over the years it was hidden and relocated on campus by different student groups. This first Bud would later be donated during World War II as scrap metal by college president, Alfred C. Nielsen, to support the war effort. The first Bud was replaced by Bud Jr., a 33-inch 200-pound replica. Sometime in the late 1940s, Bud Jr. was buried on the west end of campus, not to be unearthed again until over 50 years later in 1994 when maintenance crews were digging for fiber optic cables. Over the years multiple Buds have been created, hidden and lost as students have competed for the honor of finding and hiding the statue. The Rock ‚ÄúThe Rock,‚Äù located in front of the Humphrey Center is one of the most prominent traditions of Grand View. When re-sodding the lawn of what was then Old Main (now Humphrey Center), students in the 1900s placed the rock on the lawn directly in front of Old Main's entrance. The only significant change made to the landmark was in 1915 when it was moved to make room for a new sidewalk to the entrance. Students traditionally paint the rock in the darkness of the night whenever students feel the urge to express themselves. \\"In times of celebration, sorrow, or protest, The Rock is deemed a medium of the students,\\" a former Grand View student handbook stated. The rock is often used to announce campus events, and on at least one occasion, has been used to propose marriage. Notable alumni * B. J.

It was a launch game for the DS and the system's first Mario game. Super Mario 64 DS is a remake of the 1996 Nintendo 64 game Super Mario 64, with new graphics, characters, collectibles, a multiplayer mode, and several extra minigames. As with the original, the plot centers on rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser. Unlike the original, Yoshi is the original protagonist, with Mario, Luigi, and Wario as unlockable characters. It also acts as somewhat of a sequel. Nintendo revealed Super Mario 64 DS as a multiplayer demonstration at E3 2004, and released it in November 2004. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its single- player mode and the changes made from the original game. However, they criticized its multiplayer mode and lack of analog controls. The game is the tenth bestselling Nintendo DS game, with over 11.06 million copies sold by 2018. Super Mario 64 DS was rereleased on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016. Plot The game begins with Mario receiving a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. Mario arrives at Peach's castle, along with Luigi and Wario. The trio disappear as they enter the castle, and Lakitu, the game's camera operator, informs Yoshi of the disappearance. Yoshi explores Peach's castle to find Mario, Luigi, Wario and Peach. Scattered throughout the castle are paintings and secret walls, which act as portals to other worlds where Bowser and his minions guard the Power Stars. After recovering most of the power stars and defeating Bowser's minions, Yoshi acquires keys that access other areas of the castle, where he finds Mario and his friends captured. Yoshi defeats Goomboss and frees Mario as they continue searching the castle to find more Power Stars. Mario defeats King Boo and frees Luigi who uses \\"invisibility power\\" to get Wario's key. Luigi defeats Chief Chilly and frees Wario using the key. Mario and his friends tackle three obstacle courses, with each ensuing a battle with Bowser. After defeating him twice, they received a key that opens more levels of the castle. After collecting 80 power stars, Mario and his friends reach the highest area of the castle, where they ensue a final battle against Bowser. Eventually, after Bowser's defeat, Mario and his friends return to Peach's castle, where they free Peach from a stained-glass window above the entrance. As a reward for saving Peach, she kisses Mario on the nose and goes to bake the cake she had promised. The game ends when Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi and Wario wave goodbye to the player as Lakitu films and flies away. A photo with Peach's cake appears. Gameplay Top: Yoshi after using the power flower item to breathe fire. Bottom: Overhead map of the \\"Cool, Cool Mountain\\" level displaying the location of the character and special hats. Super Mario 64 DS is a 3D platformer in which the player controls four different characters through numerous levels to collect 150 Power Stars, 30 more than the original game. Each character is essential to fully complete the game. Each level is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are inhabited with enemies that attack the characters as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask for help. The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As the player collects stars, more areas of the castle become accessible. Power-ups in Super Mario 64 DS take the form of special hats resembling those worn by Mario, Luigi, and Wario (all voiced by Charles Martinet), and are available in some levels. Acquiring one such hat will change the player's character into the corresponding character. The hats fall off if the character is hit, but can be reacquired. Yoshi (voiced by Kazumi Totaka) is able to start a level wearing the hat of any of the available characters. Another power-up item, the \\"Power Flower\\", provides each character with a different ability: Mario is able to float, similar to Super Mario Worlds balloon item; Luigi becomes invisible and transparent, similar to the invisible hat in the Nintendo 64 version; Wario becomes coated by metal, which makes him temporarily invincible to enemy attacks and sink underwater, similar to the metal hat in the original version; and Yoshi is able to breathe fire. Each ability is necessary to complete specific areas in the game. Other items include the \\"Mushroom\\", which increases the character's size and strength, and the Feather, that only Mario can get, and which allows the character to fly in the same fashion as in Super Mario 64. However, in multiplayer VS. Mode, other characters can get wings, in Yoshi's case, he grows wings out of his body like in Super Mario World. The game uses both of the system's screens to offer new options. The top screen displays the normal gameplay, while the bottom touchscreen can function as an overhead map and touch controls. The overhead map displays the current course the player traverses and displays item locations. The touch controls include virtual buttons, which rotate the top screen's camera angle, and directional character controls, which can operate with either the DS stylus or the player's thumb using the DS wrist strap. In addition to the single-player adventure, the game includes 36 minigames and a multiplayer mode. Minigames are made accessible by catching rabbits in the main game. All minigames use the touchscreen to play and are based on different themes: racing, card games, puzzles, and so forth. The multiplayer mode uses the wireless DS Download Play where up to four players compete against each other using Green, Red, Blue and Yellow Yoshi (voiced by Kazumi Totaka)‚Äîcharacter hats appear in the stage allowing players to transform into either Mario, Luigi, or Wario. Wario can stun opponents by picking them up, swinging them, and throwing them.  Development  Comparison of the graphics from Super Mario 64 DS (left) with those from the original Nintendo 64 version. Super Mario 64 DS was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It is a remake of the Nintendo 64 launch game Super Mario 64, with the game's 3D engine mirroring many visual effects used in the original game. Graphical changes include the lack of texture filtering, and updated versions of the character models which represented their updated designs. Kenta Nagata provided the music for the game, while the voice actors from Super Mario 64 returned as well and this time, Kazumi Totaka joined the cast, playing the role of Yoshi.  Release and promotion  Originally titled \\"Super Mario 64 √ó4\\", the game was first shown as a multiplayer demonstration at the 2004 E3 before the Nintendo DS was released.

The demonstration was a more complete version of the game than the E3 version‚Äîthe game's development was 90% complete at this time‚Äîand highlighted the multiple characters in the single-player mode and included minigames; the multiplayer mode, however, was not present. Prior to the conference, the appearance of the box art on GameStop's product page caused speculation the game would be a launch game. Nintendo confirmed the rumor by announcing at the conference that the game would be a launch game of the Nintendo DS in North America and Japan. As the game's release approached, the release schedule of launch games altered; many games were delayed, while others were announced to be released a few days before the Nintendo DS. Super Mario 64 DS was the only game scheduled to be released with the system. Super Mario 64 DS was first released in North America for the Nintendo DS on November 21, 2004 as a launch game for the system. On June 5, 2011, the game was repackaged in a red-colored case (along with New Super Mario Bros., Mario Kart DS, Mario Party DS, Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story and Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!) in tandem with a price drop of $99 for the DS.

Upon its release, IGN labeled it as an \\"Editor's Choice\\" and awarded it \\"Game of the Month\\" for the Nintendo DS, citing the game as a \\"great achievement\\" of the system's capability. In 2005, the game won a Golden Joystick Award for best handheld game of year. Prior to the game's release, Craig Harris of IGN reviewed the early demonstration. He commented on the accurate recreation of the original graphics, and stated that the small Nintendo DS screen helps hide any visual flaws. Harris criticized the game's controls calling them a little \\"sluggish\\" and \\"clumsy\\". Though he praised the graphics and new gameplay additions, Harris expressed disappointment that the Mario launch game for the new system was a remake instead of a full game. IGN's Anoop Gantayat anticipated the game would be a big hit among American video game enthusiasts. In Japan, Famitsu ranked Super Mario 64 DS the 29th most wanted game. Reviewers praised the game's accurate recreation of the Nintendo 64 game, additional features, and upgrades. Phil Theobald of GameSpy lauded Super Mario 64 DS, calling it \\"fantastic\\" and complimenting the new features: minigames, use of a second screen, and extra stars. He also commented that the gameplay of the original game holds up ten years after its original release. Harris said the original feel of Super Mario 64 is retained, while the new challenges and features build upon it in a way that added to the game's longevity. He complimented the graphics and audio, and considered the game a good demonstration of the Nintendo DS's capabilities. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot also complimented the graphics, specifically the higher polygon count and smooth frame rate. He called Super Mario 64 DS a \\"great update of a classic game\\", and felt the changes and additional features offered a new experience to fans of the original. In contrast, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish felt the game did not offer enough new content to warrant a purchase. He praised the inclusion of extra characters, calling them a \\"nice twist\\", but concluded his review by calling the game a \\"poorly-conceived port\\" that should be played on the original system. Other criticism focused on the game's controls and multiplayer mode. Theobald felt the lack of an analog stick made the controls more difficult than the original game and required a short period of adjustment. He further stated that the digital pad and touchscreen's virtual analog control were \\"tricky\\" and required practice. Harris echoed similar comments and noted the touchscreen does not provide physical feedback like an analog stick. He added the game was never intended to be played without proper analog controls. Gerstmann referred to the multiplayer mode as \\"uneventful\\" and considered it lacking longevity, but commented that it was a good extra that demonstrated the system's wireless multiplayer capabilities. Theobald agreed it was a nice addition, but considered it a \\"diversion\\" that players would tire of quickly.

The aim of the Minimum Funding Requirement was to set a minimum amount of assets that a defined benefit pension scheme should hold in order to fund its promised benefits. If a scheme did not hold sufficient assets, the pension scheme was required to achieve the minimum level within a given time scale. For a scheme with less than 90% of the assets required, the scheme had to pay the shortfall below 90% within three years. Where the scheme was between 90% and 100%, the period was ten years. Although legislation set out the broad requirements of the Minimum Funding Requirement, the details of the methods and assumptions to use were specified in Guidance Note 27, issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. After the introduction of the Minimum Funding Requirement, there were several modifications to the assumptions to cope with perceived weaknesses in the original basis. However, the level of assets required by the MFR never proved sufficient to provide the benefits promised by the scheme which the MFR was supposed to fund. The Pensions Act 2004 abolished the MFR and introduced a new scheme funding objective hoped to adapt more flexibly to individual schemes' circumstances but at the same time protecting members' benefits.

The Russian expansion into Siberia began with the conquest of the Khanate of Sibir in 1582. By 1639 they reached the Pacific 65 miles southeast of the mouth of the Ulya River. East of the Yenisei River there was little land fit for agriculture, except Dauria, the land between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River which was nominally controlled by China. Poyarkov was sent to explore this land. In 1640 he was in Yakutsk as pismenyy golova (roughly, in charge of records and correspondence). In June 1643, Poyarkov with 133 men started out from Yakutsk. They were sent by the voevoda of Yakutsk, Peter Golovin. Having no idea of the proper route, Poyarkov traveled up the rivers Lena, Aldan, Uchur, Gonam. Delayed by 64 portages, it was early winter before he reached the Stanovoy watershed. Leaving 49 men to overwinter, he pushed south over the mountains in December to reach the upper Zeya River in Daur country, where he found a land of farmers with domestic animals, proper houses and Chinese trade goods who paid tribute to the Manchus who were just starting their conquest of China. He built a winter fort near the mouth of the Umelkan river. To extract supplies from the natives, he employed excessive brutality, thereby provoking their hostility and making supplies harder to get. His men survived on a diet of pine bark, stolen food, stray forest animals and native captives whom they cannibalized.W Bruce Lincoln, 'The Conquest of a Continent',page 65, citing Akheograficheskaya Kommissia,'Dopolneniia k Aktam Istoricheskim', St Petersburg 1846-72, III, document 12, pp. 52-60 By the spring of 1644 only forty of his men were left alive. Joined now by the overwintering party, they pushed down the Zeya to the Amur. Their reputation having preceded them, they had to fight their way down the Amur through numerous ambushes. By fall they reached the Gilyak country at the mouth of the Amur. With so many enemies behind him, Poyarkov thought it unwise to return by the same route. That winter they built boats and the next spring worked their way up the Sea of Okhotsk coast to the Ulia River and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by Ivan Moskvitin six years earlier. The next spring, they followed Moskvitin's route along the Maya River back to Yakutsk, arriving almost exactly three years after they left. Like so many Russian explorers and colonists in Siberia, Poyarkov received no reward. His brutal treatment of Siberian natives had made enemies even among his own men. The voevoda of Yakutsk sent him to Moscow for trial and an unknown fate. Whatever the authorities thought of Poyarkov himself, they were happy with the information he supplied. The next Russian expedition to the Amur was led by Yerofei Khabarov in 1650. See also Russian-Manchu border conflicts. References  Sources  * W.

Nautiloids flourished during the early Paleozoic era, where they constituted the main predatory animals, and developed an extraordinary diversity of shell shapes and forms. Some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known, but only a handful of species survive to the present day. Taxonomic relationships Nautiloids are among the group of animals known as cephalopods, an advanced class of mollusks which also includes ammonoids, belemnites and modern coleoids such as octopus and squid. Other mollusks include gastropods, scaphopods and bivalves. Traditionally, the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a four-fold division (by Bather, 1888), into the Orthoceratoids, nautiloids, ammonoids, and coleoids. This article is about nautiloids in that broad sense, sometimes called Nautiloidea sensu lato. Cladistically speaking, nautiloids are a paraphyletic assemblage united by shared primitive (plesiomorphic) features not found in derived cephalopods. In other words, they are a grade group that is thought to have given rise to Orthoceratoids, ammonoids and coleoids, and are defined by the exclusion of those descendent groups. Both ammonoids and coleoids have traditionally been assumed to have descended from bactritids, which in turn arose from straight- shelled Orthoceratoids. The ammonoids (a group which includes the ammonites and the goniatites) are extinct cousins of the nautiloids that evolved early in the Devonian period, some 400 million years ago. Some workers apply the name Nautiloidea to a more exclusive group, called Nautiloidea sensu stricto. This taxon consists only of those orders that are clearly related to the modern nautilus. The membership assigned varies somewhat from author to author, but usually includes Tarphycerida, Oncocerida, and Nautilida. Characteristics The subclass nautiloidea, in the broad original sense, is distinguished by two main characteristics‚Äîsimple concave septa, concave in the forward direction, that produce generally simple sutures, and a siphuncle in which the septal necks point to the rear (i.e. is retrosiphonate, throughout the ontogeny of the animal). The septa between the chambers (camerae) of the phragmocone (the chambered part of the shell) are formed during growth spurts of the animal. At that time the rear of the mantle secretes a new septum adding another chamber while the more forward part adds onto the shell. The body of the animal, its viscera, continues to occupy the last chamber of the shell ‚Äì the living chamber. The septa are perforated by the siphuncle, which runs through each of the internal chambers of the shell. Surrounding the fleshy tube of the siphuncle are structures made of aragonite (a polymorph of calcium carbonate ‚Äì which during fossilisation is often recrystallized to calcite, a more stable form of calcium carbonate [CaCO3]): septal necks and connecting rings. Some of the earlier nautiloids deposited calcium carbonate in the empty chambers (called cameral deposits) or within the siphuncle (endosiphuncular deposits), a process which may have been connected with controlling buoyancy. The nature of the siphuncle and its position within the shell are important in classifying nautiloids and can help distinguish them from ammonoids (the siphuncle is on the shell periphery in most ammonoids whereas it runs through the center of the chambers in most nautiloids). Sutures (or suture lines) are visible as a series of narrow wavy lines on the surface of the shell, and they appear where each septum contacts the wall of the outer shell. The sutures of the nautiloids are simple in shape, being either straight or slightly curved. This is different from the \\"zigzag\\" sutures of the goniatites and the highly complex sutures of the ammonites. Modern nautiloids Nautilus belauensis Much of what is known about the extinct nautiloids is based on what we know about modern nautiluses, such as the chambered nautilus, which is found in the southwest Pacific Ocean from Samoa to the Philippines, and in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia. It is not usually found in waters less than 100 meters (328 feet) deep and may be found as far down as . Nautili are free swimming animals that possess a head with two simple lens-free eyes and arms (or tentacles). They have a smooth shell over a large body chamber, which is divided into subchambers filled with an inert gas (similar to the composition of atmospheric air, but with more nitrogen and less oxygen) making the animal neutrally buoyant in the water. As many as 90 tentacles are arranged in two circles around the mouth. The animal is predatory, and has jaws which are horny and beak-like, allowing it to feed on crustaceans. Empty nautilus shells may drift a considerable distance and have been reported from Japan, India and Africa. Undoubtedy the same applies to the shells of fossil nautiloids, the gas inside the shell keeping it buoyant for some time after the animal's death, allowing the empty shell to be carried some distance from where the animal lived before finally sinking to the seafloor. Nautili propel themselves by jet propulsion, expelling water from an elongated funnel called the hyponome, which can be pointed in different directions to control their movement. Unlike the belemnites and other cephalopods, modern nautili do not have an ink sac, and there is no evidence to suggest that the extinct forms possessed one either. Furthermore, unlike the extinct ammonoids, the modern nautilus lacks an aptychus, or any sort of plate for closing its shell. With one exception, no such plate has been found in any of the extinct nautiloids either. The coloration of the shell of the modern nautilus is quite prominent, and, although somewhat rarely, the shell coloration has been known to be preserved in fossil nautiloids. They often show color patterns only on the dorsal side, suggesting that the living animals swam horizontally. Fossil record Fossil nautiloid Trilacinoceras from the Ordovician of China. Fossil orthoconic nautiloid from the Ordovician of Kentucky; an internal mold showing siphuncle and half-filled camerae, both encrusted. Cross-section of an Orthoceras nautiloid from the Siluro-Devonian of Erfoud, Morocco. Nautiloids are often found as fossils in early Palaeozoic rocks (less so in more recent strata). The shells of fossil nautiloids may be either straight (i.e., orthoconic as in Orthoceras and Rayonnoceras), curved (as in Cyrtoceras) coiled (as in Cenoceras), or rarely a helical coil (as in Lorieroceras). Some species' shells‚Äîespecially in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic‚Äîare ornamented with spines and ribs, but most have a smooth shell. The shells are formed of aragonite, although the cameral deposits may consist of primary calcite. The rocks of the Ordovician period in the Baltic coast and parts of the United States contain a variety of nautiloid fossils, and specimens such as Discitoceras and Rayonnoceras may be found in the limestones of the Carboniferous period in Ireland. The marine rocks of the Jurassic period in Britain often yield specimens of Cenoceras, and nautiloids such as Eutrephoceras are also found in the Pierre Shale formation of the Cretaceous period in the north-central United States. Specimens of the Ordovician nautiloid Endoceras have been recorded measuring up to in length, and Cameroceras is (somewhat doubtfully) estimated to have reached . These large nautiloids must have been formidable predators of other marine animals at the time they lived. In some localities, such as Scandinavia and Morocco, the fossils of orthoconic nautiloids accumulated in such large numbers that they form limestones composed of nonspecific assemblages known as cephalopod beds, cephalopod limestones, nautiloid limestones, or Orthoceras limestones in the geological literature. Although the term Orthoceras now only refers to a Baltic coast Ordovician genus, in prior times it was employed as a general name given to all straight-shelled nautiloids that lived from the Ordovician to the Triassic periods (but were most common in the early Paleozoic era). Evolutionary history Nautiloids are first known from the late Cambrian Fengshan Formation of northeastern China, where they seem to have been quite diverse (at the time this was a warm shallow sea rich in marine life). However, although four orders have been proposed from the 131 species named, there is no certainty that all of these are valid, and indeed it is likely that these taxa are seriously oversplit. Life reconstruction of Cyrtoceras sp Gyronaedyceras eryx, an oncocerid from the Middle Devonian of Wisconsin Acleistoceras whitfieldi, an oncocerid from the Middle Devonian of Wisconsin Most of these early forms died out, but a single family, the Ellesmeroceratidae, survived to the early Ordovician, where it ultimately gave rise to all subsequent cephalopods. In the Early and Middle Ordovician the nautiloids underwent an evolutionary radiation. Some eight new orders appeared at this time, covering a great diversity of shell types and structure, and ecological lifestyles. Nautiloids remained at the height of their range of adaptations and variety of forms throughout the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods, with various straight, curved and coiled shell forms coexisting at the same time. Several of the early orders became extinct over that interval, but others rose to prominence. Nautiloids began to decline in the Devonian, perhaps due to competition with their descendants and relatives the Ammonoids and Coleoids, with only the Nautilida holding their own (and indeed increasing in diversity). Their shells became increasingly tightly coiled, while both numbers and variety of non-nautilid species continued to decrease throughout the Carboniferous and Permian. The massive extinctions at the end of the Permian were less damaging to nautiloids than to other taxa and a few groups survived into the early Mesozoic, including pseudorthocerids, bactritids, nautilids and possibly orthocerids. The last straight-shelled forms were long thought to have disappeared at the end of the Triassic, but a possible orthocerid has been found in Cretaceous rocks. Apart from this exception, only a single nautiloid suborder, the Nautilina, continued throughout the Mesozoic, where they co-existed quite happily with their more specialised ammonoid cousins. Most of these forms differed only slightly from the modern nautilus. They had a brief resurgence in the early Tertiary (perhaps filling the niches vacated by the ammonoids in the end Cretaceous extinction), and maintained a worldwide distribution up until the middle of the Cenozoic Era. With the global cooling of the Miocene and Pliocene, their geographic distribution shrank and these hardy and long-lived animals declined in diversity again. Today there are only six living species, all belonging to two genera, Nautilus (the pearly nautilus), and Allonautilus. Classification Classifications vary and a subject to change as new information is found and in accordance with the perspective of various workers. The taxonomy of the Taxo Box is one such scheme, Teichert's 1988 classification is another, that of Teichert et al. 1964 in the Treatise Part K, still another. Wade (1988) divided the subclass Nautiloidea into 6 superorders, combining orders that are phylogenetically related. They are: *Plectronoceratoidea = Plectronocerida, Protactinocerida, Yanhecerida, and Ellesmerocerida. *Endoceratoidea = Endocerida *Orthoceratoidea = Orthocerida, Ascocerida, and Pseudorthocerida (the Orthoceratoidea of Kr√∂ger 1007) *Nautilitoidea = Tarphycerida, Oncocerida, and Nautilida. *Actinoceratoidea = Actinocerida *Discosoritoidea = Discosorida Three of them are established as equivalent places to put Endocerida, Actinocerida, and Discosorida. Three unite related orders that share a common ancestor and form a branch of the nautiloid taxonomic tree; Plectronoceratoidea, which consists mostly of small Cambrian forms that include the ancestors of subsequent stocks; Orthoceratoidea, which unites different primarily orthoconic orders of which one is the source for Bacritida and Ammonoidea; and Nautilitoidea, which includes the first coiled cephalopods, Tarphycerida, as well as Nautilida, which includes the recent Nautilus. Another order, Bactritida, which is derived from Orthocerida, is sometimes included with Nautiloidea, sometimes with Ammonoidea, and sometimes placed in a subclass of its own, Bactritoidea. Recently some workers in the field have come to recognize Dissidocerida as a distinct order, along with Pseudorthocerida, both previously included in Orthocerida as subtaxa. Another interpretation (Engeser, 1997-1998) suggests that nautiloids, and indeed cephalopods in general, fall into two main groups, Palcephalopoda (including all the nautiloids except Orthocerida and Ascocerida) and Neocephalopoda (the rest of the cephalopods). However, a more recent phylogenetic study by Lindgren et al. (2004) supports the monophyly of cephalopods, with Nautiloidea being a sister group to Coleoidea.

He was a master in depicting oriental rugs, silk and brocade and introduced an international style to the Northern Netherlands. Life According to Arnold Houbraken's 17th-century biographical study of Dutch painters he was born in Heidelberg or Prague.Gasper Netscher biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature His father Johann Netscher was a sculptor from Stuttgart.Liedtke, W. (2007) Dutch Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 517. The elder Netscher married Elizabet Vetter, the daughter of a mayor in Heidelberg, against her father's wishes. He died in Poland http://www.humrichfineart.com/netscher.html when Caspar was two years of age. It has been suggested that Caspar may have been the son of a Rotterdam painter.Wayne E. Franits, p. 107. Dutch Seventeenth- Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution, Yale University Press, 2004 When Heidelberg was attacked during the civil war, Caspar's mother fled with four children to an estate outside the city. When the castle was laid under siege, the people there suffered from hunger and Caspar's two older brothers died. Caspar's mother fled in the night, carrying the young Caspar in her arms and with her young daughter on foot, staying at almshouses for widows and orphans. They travelled in this way to Arnhem, where they finally found safe quarter. In Arnhem Caspar was adopted by a rich physician named A. Tullekens. At first he was destined for the profession of his patron, but owing to his great aptitude for painting he was placed under a local artist named Hendrick Coster, and through the acquaintance of Wynant Everwyn in 1654, who had family connections to Tullekens, he became a student of Ter Borch in Deventer. He was Ter Borch's most gifted pupil, probably worked as an assistant as well and he appears several times as a model on Ter Borch's paintings. The Lace Maker by Caspar Netscher (1662), oil on canvas, 33 x 27 cm. Wallace Collection, London When he came of age, he first worked for the Dutch \\"keelbeulen\\" (Houbraken called art dealers \\"cutthroats\\") until he had enough money to make a grand tour. In 1658 he set out for Italy to complete his education, booking passage on a ship to Bordeaux with letters of introduction from Tullekens for his cousin Neny there. From Bordeaux he planned to proceed overland to Italy. However, while in Bordeaux he met the mathematician and fountain designer Godijn, and married his daughter Margaretha Godijn on 25 November 1659, which halted his progress to Rome. In Bordeaux he toiled hard to earn a livelihood by painting small cabinet pictures which are now highly valued on account of their exquisite finish. Fearing the persecutions of Protestants, after his son was born he moved back North to The Hague in 1662, and turned his attention to portrait-painting. In this branch of his art was more successful. In 1668 he joined the Schutterij and Cosimo III de' Medici, traveling through the Netherlands bought four paintings.Liedtke, W. (2007) Dutch Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 518. It is likely that Netscher knew the painters Frans van Mieris, Sr. (1635?-1681) and Gerard Dou, but it is certain that he knew the painter Gerrit de Hooch from The Hague as his wife gave her name to Gerrit's new born daughter Margarita in 1676, the event being witnessed by Caspar as well as his wife.Hoogsteder & Hoogsteder, Haagse Schilders in de Gouden Eeuw, 1998, p. 316 He was patronized by William III, and his earnings soon enabled him to gratify his own taste by depicting musical and conversational pieces. It was in these that Netscher's genius was fully displayed. The choice of these subjects, and the habit of introducing female figures, dressed in glossy satins, were imitated from Ter Borch; they possess easy yet delicate pencilling, brilliant and correct colouring, and pleasing light and shade; but frequently their refinement passes into weakness. The painter was gaining both fame and wealth when he began to suffer from gout and took to his bed, where he continued to paint lying down and died prematurely in 1684, in The Hague. His sons Constantyn (1668‚Äì1722), and Theodorus (1661‚Äì1732), were also painters after their father's style, who Houbraken meant to include in his 4th volume of painters. He was also the father of Anthonie Netscher who emigrated to Batavia. According to the RKD, his registered pupils in the Confrerie Pictura besides his three sons were Johannes van den Brande, Otto Brandt, Olivier van Deuren, Jacob van der Does the younger, Van Hardenbroeck, Dani√´l Haringh, Mouritz van der Linden, J. Spick, Jan Tilius and Aleida Wolfsen. Gallery Image:Caspar Netscher 001.jpgThe Medaillon File:Caspar Netscher.

Early life Guthrie was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, the son of Dr Thomas Guthrie (a grandson of the Scottish preacher Thomas Guthrie) and Norah Power. His mother Norah was the daughter of Sir William James Tyrone Power, Commissary-General-in-chief of the British Army from 1863 to 1869 and Martha, daughter of Dr. John Moorhead of Annaghmakerrig House and his Philadelphia-born wife, Susan (n√©e Allibone) Humphreys. His great-grandfather was Irish actor Tyrone Power and was a second cousin of famed film actor Tyrone Power. Guthrie's sister, Susan Margaret, married his close university friend, fellow Anglo-Irishman Hubert Butler. Tyrone Guthrie received a degree in history at Oxford University, where he was active in student theatre, and worked for a season at the newly established Oxford Playhouse. Career In 1924 Guthrie joined the BBC as a broadcaster and began to produce plays for radio. This led to a year directing for the stage with the Scottish National Players, before returning to the BBC to become one of the first writers to create plays designed for radio performance. From 1929‚Äì33, he directed at various theatres, including the Cambridge Festival Theatre in 1929 and a production of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author at the Westminster Theatre in 1932. During 1933‚Äì34, and again from 1936‚Äì45, he was director of the Shakespeare Repertory Company.Robert Tanitch, London Stage in the 20th Century, Haus (2007); While in Montreal, Guthrie produced the Romance of Canada series of radio plays for recalling epic moments in Canadian history. The series was broadcast on the Canadian National Railway radio network. Hubert Butler translated the text for Guthrie's 1934 production of Anton Chekhov's Cherry Orchard, for perhaps its first English- language production. In the 1940s Guthrie began to direct operas, to critical acclaim, including a realistic Carmen at Sadler's Wells and the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He also returned to Scotland where, with James Bridie in 1948, he staged the first modern adaptation, by Robert Kemp, of Sir David Lyndsay's grand-scale medieval comedy Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis for the Second Edinburgh International Festival; a landmark event in the modern revival of Scottish theatre. Staged in the city's General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Mound, specially adapted for the occasion, it was here that Guthrie's hallmark thrust stage first proved its full worth. =Stratford Festival of Canada= In 1952, he was invited to help launch the Stratford Festival of Canada. Intrigued with the idea of starting a Shakespeare theatre in a remote Canadian location, he enlisted Tanya Moiseiwitsch to further develop his thrust stage design, successfully improvised in Edinburgh, and actors Alec Guinness and Irene Worth to star in the inaugural production of Richard III. All performances in the first seasons took place in a large tent on the banks of the Avon River. He remained as Artistic Director for three seasons, and his work at Stratford had a strong influence in the development of Canadian theatre.The Stratford Festival: The First 50 Years -- Arts and Entertainment -- CBC Archives Guthrie produced Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore in 1960 and The Pirates of Penzance in 1961, which were televised in Canada and also brought to the Phoenix Theatre in New York and on tour in the US. In 1962, as soon as the Gilbert and Sullivan copyrights expired, he brought these productions to Britain; they soon played at Her Majesty's Theatre and were broadcast by the BBC. They were among the first Savoy opera productions in Britain not authorized by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.Berger, Leon. \\"Obituary: Marion Studholme\\", Gilbert and Sullivan News, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society (London), Vol. V, No. 10, Spring 2016, p. 19 =Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota= In 1963, he founded the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, designed by Ralph Rapson. He published a small invitation in 1959 in the drama page of The New York Times soliciting communities' interest and involvement in a resident theater. From that beginning, Twin Cities was chosen and the Guthrie Theater was established, with construction being completed in 1963. Guthrie served as Artistic Director until 1966, and continued to direct at the theater he founded until 1969, two years before his death. =Legacy= In the prologue to his biography, James Forsyth wrote, \\"Anti-Broadway, anti-West End, anti everything implied in the term 'Legitimate Theatre', he ended up with a legitimate claim to the title of 'most important, British-born theatre director of his time.James Forsyth/Hamish Hamilton. Tyrone Guthrie: The Authorized Biography, London (1976); Sir Peter Hall wrote, \\"Among the great originators in British Theatre...Guthrie was a towering figure in every sense. He blazed a trail for the subsidised theatre of the sixties. He showed how to run a company and administer a theatre. And he was a brilliant and at times great director...\\"Peter Hall's Diaries: The Story of a Dramatic Battle (1983) Harper & Row. Guthrie wrote two major books about the creation of effective drama: Theatre Prospect (1932)Tyrone Guthrie (132) Theatre Prospect, Wishart & Co., London and A Life in the Theatre (1959).Tyrone Guthrie (1959), A Life in the Theatre, McGraw-Hill, Columbus, Ohio. Guthrie's autobiography, A Life in the Theatre, was adapted into a stage play, Guthrie on Guthrie by Margaret Dale. It was produced at the Stratford Festival in 1989, and again at the Glenn Gould Studio in 1998 for recording as an audiobook. Both productions featured Colin Fox as Guthrie. =Queen's University Belfast= He was Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast (1963‚Äì70). On 15 September 2010 a blue plaque in his memory was unveiled at the BBC in Belfast by the Ulster History Circle. Personal life In 1931, Guthrie married Judith Bretherton, who survived him by only a year. He was knighted in 1961, and died a decade later at his home, Annaghmakerrig, in Newbliss, County Monaghan, Ireland, aged 70, from a severe heart attack. His body was buried in the graveyard of Aghabog Church of Ireland, in Newbliss.Obituary, Tyrone Guthrie, Palm Beach Post, May 16, 1971 Bibliography    See also * Guthrie Theater production history References External links  * *Directing a Play: A Lecture by Tyrone Guthrie - Delivered at the West Side YMCA, NYC (Smithsonian Folkways) *Interview with Stratford Festival costumer Cynthia MacLennan on working with Guthrie (Theatre Museum Canada) Category:1900 births Category:1971 deaths Category:BBC people Category:Chancellors of Queen's University Belfast Category:Disease-related deaths in Ireland Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:English people of Irish descent Category:English theatre directors Category:Knights Bachelor Category:People from Royal Tunbridge Wells Category:Power family Category:Stratford Festival Category:Tony Award winners Category:20th-century poets Category:Canadian artistic directors ","title":"Tyrone Guthrie"},{"id":"861690","text":"The location of the withers on a horse The withers is the ridge between the shoulder blades of an animal, typically a quadruped. In many species, it is the tallest point of the body. In horses and dogs, it is the standard place to measure the animal's height. In contrast, cattle are often measured to the top of the hips. Horses The withers in horses are formed by the dorsal spinal processes of roughly the 3rd through 11th thoracic vertebrae, which are unusually long in this area. Most horses have 18 thoracic vertebrae. The processes at the withers can be more than long. Since they do not move relative to the ground as the horse's head does, the withers are used as the measuring point for the height of a horse. Horses are sometimes measured in hands - one hand is . Horse heights are extremely variable, from small pony breeds to large draft breeds. The height at the withers of an average thoroughbred is , and ponies are up to . =Conformational issues= The withers of the horse are considered in evaluating conformation. Generally, a horse should have well-defined withers, as they are considered an important attachment point for the muscles of the torso. Withers of medium height are preferred, as high withers make it difficult to fit a saddle and are often associated with a narrow chest, and low withers (known as \\"mutton withers\\") do not provide a ridge to help keep the saddle in place. More importantly, the dorsal spinal processes provide an attachment for the muscles that support the shoulder and neck. Horses do not have a clavicle, so the shoulder can freely rotate backwards. If the vertebrae of the withers are long front-to-back, the shoulder is more free to move backwards. This allows for an increase of stride length. thus increasing the horse's speed. It is also important in jumping, as the shoulder must rotate back for the horse to make his forearm more parallel to the ground, which will then raise the animal's knees upward and get the lower legs out of the way. Therefore, the withers have a direct impact on one of the most important points of conformation: the shoulder. Dogs In dogs, the height of the withers is often used to determine the dog's jump height in various dog sports. It is also often a determining factor in whether the dog conforms to the show-quality standards for its breed.

He was played by Ronnie Barker. In the pilot episode Fletcher claims to Mr Barrowclough that he was sentenced for stealing a lorry which then crashed through garden walls and a tool-shed when its brakes failed. This turns out a shaggy dog story leading up to the punchline \\"I asked for six other fences to be taken into consideration\\". In other episodes it is stated that he was sentenced for breaking and entering and that he is a career burglar. His tactics range from the practical (stealing pills from the prison doctor and eggs from the prison farmyard), to the symbolic (finding new and imaginative ways to stick two fingers up at Mackay and get away with it). In return, Mackay's frenzied, neurotic attempts to catch Fletch out, when fruitful, give the warder a level of smugness and satisfaction that is only accentuated by his charge's hostility and skulking. Fletch is also surprised when this spell in prison finds him taking on the role of the father figure. It is left to him to help Warren when he needs a letter read or written, and to oversee new, younger inmates such as McClaren and Godber. Fletch is also manipulative, and can play upon the sympathies and weaknesses of people like the liberal warden, Mr Barrowclough, and the ineffectual prison governor to acquire more pleasant employment, accommodation or special privileges. Fletcher was born, in his words, \\"two-two-thirty-two\\" - 2 February 1932. He is a native of Muswell Hill. His elder daughter Ingrid was conceived in Highgate Cemetery, shortly before his marriage to Isobel at the age of 19. He also has a younger daughter Marion and a son Raymond. Fletcher did his post-war National Service in the early 1950s, including service in the Malayan Emergency. He joined the Royal Army Service Corps or RASC, which he refers to in army slang as \\"Run Away, Someone's Coming\\". He was \\"King of the Teds\\" in Muswell Hill, circa 1955, and retains fond memories of Gloria, a seamstress with whom he had an affair at that time, and who used to tighten his trousers for him. Upon release from prison Fletch decided to give up his criminal career. In the follow-up series, Going Straight, he took a job as a hotel night-porter, but found himself often tempted back into crime, although he resisted. His wife, Isobel, had left him, leaving him in sole charge of Raymond. When last seen, in the mockumentary Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher, Fletch was landlord of a pub in Muswell Hill, alongside his second wife, Gloria (an old flame briefly mentioned in Porridge). In 2009, the character was revived in a stage production, penned by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and is played by Shaun Williamson. In the 2016 revival of the show, also titled Porridge, it is revealed that Fletcher died circa 2011. Personality and traits For a man of his age and poor education, Fletch speaks with confidence and a large vocabulary on a wide range of topics including politics, race relations, the justice system and society in general, and appears to possess a considerable degree of natural intellect. Although he is a tolerant man (he is friends with McClaren, a black man, and Lukewarm, a homosexual), he is often cynical about the world, and is generally pessimistic. For the most part his attitude never goes beyond simple complaining and playful teasing of Mr. Mackay, although Fletch occasionally shows a darker side which reflects his true mental state, usually when he is talking about his past. The large amount of time he has spent in prison has left him feeling that he has wasted his life. In the final episode of Going Straight, he is convinced not to go back to crime after walking into a pet shop and seeing the animals in cages, reminding him of his time in prison. He struggles to adapt to life on the outside after his spell in Slade prison, and his frayed nerves have resulted in a quick temper, shown by how quick he is to shout at his daughter Ingrid. He is also something of a drinker - on one occasion, after sneaking away from an outdoor trip, he goes straight to a pub and drinks several pints of beer, one of which he downs in one. In Going Straight, he consumes several pints of beer and a few whisky chasers just on the train from Carlisle to London. He mentions that an average day in Muswell Hill involved visiting four different pubs for a 'swift half'. He is upset that his wife Isobel has left him, and struggles to cope with the responsibility of holding his family together. Fletch is a Tottenham Hotspur supporter; in one episode Fletch tells an inmate that while on compassionate leave he had \\"a sing song at the pub, a Sunday roast and watched Spurs win at home\\". In the first episode of Going Straight he collects his personal possessions upon his release from the prison -- one of which includes a Tottenham Hotspur key chain. However, in the movie version, this affiliation is contradicted when Fletcher states that he is a lifetime Leyton Orient supporter. This contradiction may have been needed for a laugh line in the movie script since Fletcher was trying in the story line to avoid coaching the prison football team, and was suggesting he'd faced a lifetime of fan disappointment: that could not really be said of a Tottenham supporter in 1979 (when the movie was released), but could credibly be said about Leyton, which had spent the preceding several decades languishing in the 2nd- and 3rd-tiers of English football.

This is one of the largest sports clubs of Portugal. The Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra - O.A.F. (its autonomous professional football club) is one of its better known sports clubs across Portugal due to a regular presence on the Portuguese Football Championship and the popularity of football in the country. In rugby (Portuguese Rugby Union Championship), volleyball (Portuguese Volleyball Championship) and basketball (Portuguese Basketball League (LCB)) competitions, AAC is also represented at the highest level, as well as in several olympic disciplines.

All the students of UC are entitled to vote for the AAC board. Since the late nineties inside the AAC structure have been created several local student unions, representing courses, departments or sometimes faculties. Known as ‚ÄúN√∫cleos‚Äù (Portuguese for nucleus), these semi-independent unions have their own elected internal organs. All of them represent a major role in the AAC political, cultural, sportive and social life. In 2008 the AAC comprehended 25 of such unions, of which NEFLUC (Students union of the Faculty of Letters) is the biggest, representing nearly 3000 students. Students in robes (for the first week of the class year), University of Coimbra The main building of the Coimbra's Academic Association was inaugurated in 1961 and holds the offices of many sports clubs (sec√ß√µes desportivas) and arts sections (sec√ß√µes culturais). There are also rehearsal halls, a medical centre, academic services, extensive indoor gardens, a theatre-cinema with approximately 1,000 seats (Teatro Acad√©mico de Gil Vicente), and a caf√©‚Äìrestaurant where many students meet up and enjoy a wide selection of foods. AAC is the umbrella organization for a number of autonomous entities, the organismos aut√≥nomos. Some of its better known former members include Salgado Zenha, Manuel Alegre, Ant√≥nio de Almeida Santos, Miguel Torga, Ant√≥nio Nobre, Verg√≠lio Ferreira, Zeca Afonso, and Adriano Correia de Oliveira. In addition, the AAC is the organizing and regulating body of the typical student Praxe (Praxis) of the University of Coimbra (UC), a rich tradition of rituals and festivities organized by UC's students, for the students. =Sports sections= A view of the southern top of the University Stadium and Sports Complex of the University of Coimbra near the Mondego river.

Such as the above-mentioned Orfeon Acad√©mico de Coimbra (1880), which today represents the city of Coimbra and the university during its world tours. The same applies to the main football team of the AAC, the Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra - O.A.F., usually known as \\"Acad√©mica\\" or \\"Briosa\\". This team is amongst the top Portuguese football leagues and was created in 1876. It is a professional football club, established by the AAC and also part of the AAC as an independent club. The AAC football club was the first ever winner of the Portuguese Football Cup, in 1939. Among the autonomous organisations of AAC there are also some well reputed theatre groups with a vast curriculum of acclaimed performances and playing a critical part in the city's cultural life. AAC autonomous organisations include: *Choral music: OAC - Orfeon Acad√©mico de Coimbra and CMUC - Coro Misto da Universidade de Coimbra *Folk music and Ethnography: Grupo de Etnografia e Folclore da Academia de Coimbra *Professional football team: Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra - O.A.F. *Music: Tuna Acad√©mica da Universidade de Coimbra *Plastic arts: C√≠rculo de Artes Pl√°sticas de Coimbra *Theatre: TEUC - Teatro dos Estudantes da Universidade de Coimbra and CITAC - C√≠rculo de Inicia√ß√£o Teatral da Academia de Coimbra Events The AAC is also responsible for the organization of the Queima das Fitas, one of the biggest student festivals in Europe and a great event in the city. The Festa das Latas, a smaller-scale event is the freshman's week of the University of Coimbra, also organised by the AAC. The AAC is the official body of the traditional Praxe, a sort of students' rite of passage, created by students of the University of Coimbra, which has a code of conduct, the C√≥digo da Praxe), a book published within the students' union. The Symbol The tower of the University of Coimbra Before the current logo, the AAC used to be represented by a black cape to reflect the university's traditional students' uniform. The AAC logo was created by Francisco Pimentel in 1927 by an order of the AAC Main board. The logo of AAC has a stylized drawing of the University Tower. The Tower of Coimbra's University is the city's ¬´ex-libris¬ª with its iconic bell. The tower's bell is known amongst the students as the cabra (she-goat). The tower is of Baroque style by the school of the German-born architect Ludovice who built it between 1728 and 1733. It is almost 34 metres high, and has a narrow and circular staircase which leads to a belvedere with remarkable views over the university, the historical part of the city centre and the river Mondego. AAC uniqueness University of Coimbra's AAC is the biggest organization of its kind in Europe. AAC has a long history and unmatched reputation in student sports, cultural activities, and political activism. With a long history of struggle against unpopular state policies, forming notable politicians and intellectuals along the way, it also harbours a very dynamic associative life. Other similar students' unions in the country, such as Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica da Universidade de Aveiro (University of Aveiro), Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica da Universidade da Beira Interior (University of Beira Interior), Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica da Universidade do Minho (Minho University), or Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica da Universidade do Algarve (University of the Algarve), are smaller students' unions by number of associates because its universities have a smaller number of students or because the universities' student's aren't automatically members of the union, with a membership fee being required. In other places in Portugal, there are many independent faculty, institute and school organizations of students from many mother- institutions (universities or polytechnical institutes) that are not representative of the whole mother-institution, being this fragmentation the reason for their smaller size, importance, and strength. There are also federations of students' unions comprising public and private, university and polytechnic independent and not related institutions from a city, like FAP - Federa√ß√£o Acad√©mica do Porto (from Porto) which is the largest students organization in the country, that do not represent a single university or polytechnic, but many independent federated students' unions from institutions of the most diverse kind.

James McClure was born and raised in South Africa and educated in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, at Scottsville School (1947‚Äì51), Cowan House (1952‚Äì54), and Maritzburg College (1955‚Äì58). He worked first as a commercial photographer with Tom Sharpe, who later wrote a series of celebrated comic novels, and then as a teacher of English and art at Cowan House in 1959‚Äì63, before becoming a crime reporter and photographer for the Natal Witness in his home town of Pietermaritzburg. His journalistic career saw him headhunted first by the Natal Mercury and then by the Natal Daily News. After the birth of his first son, he moved to Britain with his family in 1965, where he joined the Scottish Daily Mail as a sub-editor. From there, he moved to the Oxford Mail and then to the Oxford Times. His first crime novel, The Steam Pig, won the CWA Gold Dagger in 1971. He resigned as deputy editor in 1974 to write full-time. He added to his series of police procedurals based on his experiences in South Africa, featuring the detective partnership of Afrikaner Lieutenant Tromp Kramer and Bantu Detective Sergeant Mickey Zondi. McClure also wrote a spy novel set in Southern Africa ‚Äì Rogue Eagle ‚Äì which won the 1976 CWA Silver Dagger, a number of short stories, and two large non- fiction works that won wide acclaim: Spike Island: Portrait of a Police Division (Liverpool) and Copworld: Inside an American Police Force (San Diego). After publishing 14 books, he returned to the bottom rung of \\"The Oxford Times\\" in 1986, as his police books had made him aware of how much he had missed working with others ‚Äì his intention being to write in his spare time. What proved his most popular Kramer and Zondi novel then followed, The Song Dog, but journalism soon became all consuming. He became editor in 1994 and three years later The Oxford Times won the Weekly Newspaper of the Year award, beating all comers from across the United Kingdom. He was promoted to editor of the Oxford Mail in 2000, and spent the next three years on a variety of objectives to enhance the quality and revenue of the county's daily paper. That done, he decided it was time to again step down, and retired to return to writing. He was working on a novel set in Oxford and had just started his own blog when he came down with a respiratory illness and died on 17 June 2006. He lived in Wallingford, Oxfordshire.

It specializes in clothing and outdoor recreation equipment. Company history Company founder Leon Leonwood Bean (1872-1967) L.L.Bean store in Yonkers, New York L.L.Bean boot sculpture outside flagship store in Freeport, Maine L.L.Bean was founded in 1912 by its namesake, hunter and fisherman Leon Leonwood Bean, in Freeport, Maine. The company began as a one-room operation selling a single product, the Maine Hunting Shoe (also known as duck boots). Bean had developed a waterproof boot, which is a combination of lightweight leather uppers and rubber bottoms, that he sold to hunters. He obtained a list of nonresident Maine hunting license holders, prepared a descriptive mail order circular, set up a shop in his brother's basement in Freeport and started a nationwide mail-order business. By 1912, he was selling the Bean Boot, or Maine Hunting Shoe, through a four-page mail-order catalog, and the boot remains a staple of the company's outdoor image. Defects in the initial design led to 90 percent of the original production run being returned: Bean honored his money-back guarantee, corrected the design, and continued selling them. The L.L.Bean retail store campus in Freeport, Maine, is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Leon L. Bean died on February 5, 1967, in Pompano Beach, Florida. He is buried in Freeport's Webster Cemetery.Rogak, Lisa (2004), Stones and Bones of New England: A guide to unusual, historic, and otherwise notable cemeteries, Globe Pequat The company passed into the directorship of Bean's grandson, Leon Gorman, from that time until 2001, when Gorman decided to take the position of Chairman, leaving the position of CEO to Christopher McCormick, the first non-family member to assume the title. On May 19, 2013, Shawn Gorman, 47, a great-grandson of the company's founder, was elected L.L.Bean's chairman. The company announced a US$125,000 donation to a new scholarship fund upon Leon Gorman's death in 2015, representing about 2.5 years of tuition at his alma mater, Bowdoin College. Stephen Smith was named CEO in November 2015, the first time in the company's 103-year history that a CEO had been hired from outside the company. Product line The company sells a variety of hiking, weather, and other utility boots, along with other outdoor equipment such as firearms, backpacks, and tents, and produces a full line of clothing, which is now its mainstay. L.L.Bean sources its products from the US and across the globe. As of 2016, its Brunswick, Maine, factory employed more than 450 people who made the company's products by hand, such as the Maine Hunting Shoe, L.L.Bean Boot, Boat and Totes, dog beds, leather goods, and backpacks. In 2000, L.L.Bean partnered Japanese automaker Subaru, making L.L.Bean the official outfitter of Subaru, spawning the L.L.Bean edition Subaru Outback and Subaru Forester for the US market. The L.L.Bean trim levels were top-spec versions, with all available options included as standard equipment. This relationship with Subaru ended June 28, 2008. In 2010, L.L.Bean created a contemporary sub-brand called L.L.Bean Signature. The Signature line is a modern interpretation of L.L.Bean's previous products with modern fits. Retail stores L.L.Bean store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at Ross Park Mall Along with a number of retail and outlet stores, the company maintains its flagship store on Main Street in Freeport, Maine. This branch, originally opened in 1917, has been open 24 hours a day since 1951, with the exception of two Sundays in 1962 when Maine changed its blue laws; a town vote later reinstated the store's open-door policy. The flagship has closed to honor the death of US President John F. Kennedy in 1963, as well as the deaths of founder Leon Bean in 1967 and his grandson Leon Gorman in 2015. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, all L.L.Bean stores are closed indefinitely starting on March 17, 2020 at midnight, marking it the fifth time in the company's history that the flagship has closed, and the first time ever for more than 24 hours. L.L.Bean, for its part, has invested heavily in activities for both visitors and residents in Freeport, including their Outdoor Discovery Schools, Christmas light displays, and their Summer Concert Series, which has attracted artists such as Grace Potter, Lake Street Dive, Edwin McCain, Great Big Sea, Buckwheat Zydeco, and Rockapella. L.L.Bean opened its first outlet store in North Conway, New Hampshire, in 1988. The company operates 30 retail stores and 10 factory outlets in the US, and 25 retail stores in Japan, in addition to its catalog and online sales operations. The L.L.Bean Bootmobile travels the United States and serves as a mobile store during its college tour with a limited selection of products. Rockapella performs at the L.L.Bean Summer Concert Series, July 2003. In March 2018, L.L.Bean opened their first urban location in Boston's Seaport District. The store will be the model for further expansion in urban areas and carry a selection of merchandise selected to fit the surrounding community. In November 2019, it was announced that L.L.Bean will be launching in the UK. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, L.L.Bean announced it would temporarily close all its U.S. retail stores, including the flagship store in Freeport, Maine, until March 29, 2020, or as permitted by local authorities. =Returns policy= From its founding, L.L.Bean had an unlimited return policy, which allowed customers to return items with which they were dissatisfied at any time, even without a purchase receipt. On February 9, 2018, the company announced it would be limiting returns to within one year of purchase, and only with a receipt or other proof of purchase. L.L.Bean said that some customers had been abusing the policy by returning items that had been purchased from yard sales and third parties or used the policy as a lifetime replacement program for items with normal wear and tear. L.L.Bean has also stated it reserves the right to deny returns to those who regularly return items. Political controversy In January 2017, there was a call from a group of political activists to boycott L.L.Bean after it was disclosed that Linda Bean, one of the descendants of founder Leon Leonwood Bean who sits on the board of directors, had donated US$60,000 to a political action committee that supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. There were assertions that the contribution may be illegal. Trump posted on Twitter, in support of Linda Bean after calls for the boycott, \\"Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean.\\" The company said it had not donated to Trump, nor have any of the other directors or any of the 50 other Bean heirs. It was unclear if the publicity hurt business, since sales were flat prior and for a second straight year in 2016. Outdoor Discovery Schools L.L.Bean has education programs connected to many of its retail outlets to support the outdoor interests of its customers. Customers can sign up to participate in a number of outdoor activities; all equipment and instruction are provided. Activities include archery, clay shooting, fly casting, and sea kayaking. More advanced classes are conducted as well, and must be reserved in advance. Snowshoeing and cross country skiing are available December to March. All other retail stores offer fly casting and kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding.Walk On Adventures at LLBean.com In popular culture L.L.Bean Bootmobile in Freeport, Maine, July 7, 2012 * Netflix Show Luke Cage references the company's return policy in Season 1, Episode 3.

The theory proposed that because this primal language had close phonemic resemblances to Turkish, all other languages can essentially be traced back to Turkic roots. According to the theory, the Central Asian worshippers, who wanted to salute the omnipotence of the sun and its life-giving qualities, had done so by transforming their meaningless blabbering into a coherent set of ritual utterings, and language was born, hence the name. Origins Influences on the theory included: * the ideas of the French historian Hilaire de Barenton, expressed in \\"L'Origine des Langues, des Religions et des Peuples\\", that all languages originated from hieroglyphs and cuneiform used by Sumerians * a paper of the Austrian linguist Hermann F.

He influenced fellow Dutch painters Gabriel Metsu, Gerrit Dou, Eglon van der Neer and Johannes Vermeer. According to Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., Ter Borch \\"established a new framework for subject matter, taking people into the sanctum of the home\\", showing the figures' uncertainties and expertly hinting at their inner lives. His influence as a painter, however, was later surpassed by Vermeer. Biography Gerard ter Borch was born in December 1617 in Zwolle in the province of Overijssel in the Dutch Republic. He received an excellent education from his father Gerard ter Borch the Elder, also an artist, and developed his talent very early. The inscription on a study of a head proves that Ter Borch was at Amsterdam in 1632, where he studied possibly under Willem Cornelisz Duyster or Pieter Codde. Duyster's influence can be traced in a picture bearing the date 1638, in the Ionides Bequest (Victoria and Albert Museum). In 1634 he studied under Pieter de Molijn in Haarlem. A record of this Haarlem period is the Consultation (1635) at the Berlin Gallery. The Ratification of the Spanish- Dutch Treaty of M√ºnster, 15 May 1648 (1648) in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam In 1635 he was in London, and subsequently he travelled in Germany, France, Spain and Italy. His sister Gesina also became a painter. It is certain that he was in Rome in 1641, when he painted the small portraits on copper of Jan Six, A Young Lady (Six Collection, Amsterdam) and the portrait of a Gentlemen (DMK Collection Nuermberg). In 1648 he was at M√ºnster during the meeting of the congress which ratified the treaty of peace between the Spaniards and the Dutch, and executed his celebrated little picture, painted upon copper, of the assembled plenipotentiaries‚Äîa work which, along with the a portrait of a Man Standing, now represents the master in the national collection in London. The picture was bought by the marquess of Hertford at the Demidoff sale for 1280, and presented to the National Gallery by Sir Richard Wallace, at the suggestion of his secretary, Sir John Murray Scott. His sister Gesina modelled for his painting Sitting Young Woman ( 1650) At this time Ter Borch was invited to visit Madrid, where he received employment and the honour of knighthood from Philip IV, but, in consequence of an intrigue, it is said, he was obliged to return to the Netherlands. He seems to have resided for a time in Haarlem; but he finally settled in Deventer, where he became a member of the town council, as which he appears in the portrait now in the gallery of the Hague. He died at Deventer in 1681. Works Ter Borch is a significant painter of genre subjects. He is known for his rendering of texture in draperies, for example in The Letter and in The Gallant Conversation, engraved by Johann Georg Wille.Philadelphia Museum of Art page. Ter Borch's works are comparatively rare; about eighty have been catalogued. Six of these are at the Hermitage, six at the Berlin Museum, five at the Louvre, four at the Dresden Museum, three at the Getty Center, and two at the Wallace Collection. A pair of portraits were located at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C., highlighted in 2010 by Blake Gopnik. The artist's painting The Suitor's Visit, c. 1658, oil on canvas, 80 x 75 cm (31¬Ω √ó 29 9/16 in.) in the Andrew W.

A Member of Parliament (MP) from 1907 to 1910, he is most notable for his sensational by-election victory at Colne Valley in 1907, and for his unexplained disappearance in 1920. Early years Albert Victor Grayson was born in Liverpool, the seventh son of William Grayson, a Yorkshire carpenter, and Elizabeth Craig, who was Scottish.Mystery of Left's maverick Nally, Michael. The Observer (1901- 2003) [London (UK)] 30 Aug 1981: 4. He became an apprentice engineer in Bootle. Grayson joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and toured the country giving lectures, becoming a well-known orator despite having a stammer. In 1907 he stood as an ILP candidate in the 1907 Colne Valley by-election, having been nominated by the Colne Valley Labour League; he won a sensational, albeit narrow, victory. Grayson was paid an allowance by the ILP but refused to sign the Labour Party constitution. Grayson was subject to an amusing assessment by Winston Churchill in 1908: \\"The Socialism of the Christian era was based on the idea that, 'All mine is yours,' but the Socialism of Mr Grayson is based on the idea that 'All yours is mine.'\\" Writing of Grayson in an article on British radical politics in Pravda, Vladimir Lenin noted that Grayson was \\"a very fiery socialist, but one not strong in principles and given to phrase- mongering.\\"V.I. Lenin, \\"British Socialist Party Conference,\\" Pravda, No. 109, 14 May 1913. Reprinted in V.I. Lenin: Collected Works, Vol. 19. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1963. Page 93. Grayson rarely attended the House of Commons and began to develop a drinking problem. After losing his seat in the January 1910 general election, and failing even to retain his deposit when standing for Kennington, he continued his lecture tours but suffered a mental breakdown in 1913. Grayson later alienated many of his left-wing colleagues by backing Britain's entry into World War I and turning his oratorical skills to recruiting soldiers. He served briefly in the New Zealand Army and was wounded. After the war, Grayson attempted to resurrect his political career. Honours scandal In 1918 Sir Basil Thomson, head of the Special Branch, asked Maundy Gregory to spy on Grayson, suspecting him of working as an agent for the new communist government in Russia or for the Irish Republican Army. Grayson discovered that Gregory was spying on him and, with the help of some important friends, found out that Prime Minister David Lloyd George was using Gregory to sell political honours. At a public meeting in Liverpool, Grayson accused Lloyd George of selling honours for between ¬£10,000 and ¬£40,000. He declared: \\"This sale of honours is a national scandal. It can be traced right down to 10 Downing Street, and to a monocled dandy with offices in Whitehall. I know this man, and one day I will name him.\\" Grayson's \\"monocled dandy\\" remark let Gregory know that he was in danger of being exposed. At the beginning of September 1920, Grayson was beaten up in the Strand. This was probably an attempt to frighten him, but he continued threatening to name the man behind the corrupt system. Disappearance By 1920 Grayson was living in an expensive suite of rooms in Piccadilly, although he earned only a modest income from occasional pieces of journalism. Biographer David Clark believes that, having alienated both the socialists and the trade unions, Grayson had entered into blackmail in order to fund his lavish lifestyle. On 28 September 1920, Grayson was out drinking with friends when he received a telephone message. He told his friends that he had to go to the Queen's Hotel in Leicester Square and would be back shortly. He did not return. Journalist Donald McCormick claims that artist George Flemwell had been painting a picture of the Thames when he saw Grayson entering a house (Number 6, The Island, Thames Ditton) on the river bank on 28 September 1920. Flemwell knew Grayson, having painted his portrait before the war, but did not realise the significance at the time because Grayson was not reported missing until several months later. An investigation carried out in the 1960s revealed that the house that Grayson entered was owned by Gregory. Research by Andrew Cook, however, suggests that McCormick may have fabricated the story. It has been speculated that Grayson was murdered to prevent his revealing evidence of corruption. However, a comprehensive biography by David G. Clark suggests his possible survival into the 1950s under a pseudonym. Clark believes Grayson was bribed in order to keep quiet about the honours scandal, and was told to forge a new identity. Clark also argued that Grayson was bisexual, a claim repeated elsewhere.

Telkom is a semi-privatised, 39% state-owned enterprise. History of telecommunications in South Africa The first use of telecommunication in South Africa happened in April 1860 was a single line telegraph connecting Cape Town and Simonstown. In 1879, the first undersea links were introduced, first connecting Durban and Europe. In the 1960s, South Africa was connected to 72 nations and total outgoing annual international calls numbered over 28,800. In 1994, South Africa launched its mobile operations, underwritten by Telkom in partnership with Vodafone. This subsidiary grew to be Vodacom, which Telkom sold in late 2008 in preference for its own 3G network (established as 8ta, but now Telkom Mobile). Vodacom has a subscriber base of more than 45M, with an average revenue per user of more than R60 across both rural and urban subscribers. Vodacom, together with the other operators, have come under criticism in late 2009 by government and the public for high interconnect charges. In 2005, the Department of Communications redefined the Electronics Communications Act, which consolidated and redefined the landscape of telecommunications licensing in South Africa (both mobile and fixed). The Independent Communications Authority (ICASA) currently licenses more than 400 independent operators with the Electronic Communications Network License (with the ability to self-provision) as well as issuing Electronic Communications Service Licenses for service deployment over infrastructure in the retail domain. Nowadays, Telkom faces competition from the second Fixed Network Operator Licensee, Neotel, as well as the three mobile operators, Vodacom, MTN, and Cell-C. Telkom group structure Telkom Group Head Office, as seen from Church Square, Pretoria - City Centre (Direction: NNW) Telkom SA is structured under Group CEO, Brian Armstrong. The retail division, including Telkom Business, Telkom Mobile, Consumer Marketing, Cloud, and IT Operations are run by Group Chief Operating Officer, Brite Devassy, and its Wholesale and Networks division (OpenServe) is under Zoltan Miklos. Cybernest focuses on Telkom's newly deployed DCO infrastructure in Cape Town, Pretoria, and Johannesburg, as well as services thereupon, including data hosting, LAN and application management, and managing IT infrastructure for corporate and large business customers. Telkom acquired Business Connexion in August 2015 for approximately ZAR 2.6 billion with the strategic intent of obtaining a significant presence in the Information Technology (IT) market in South Africa. This was the second attempt at the acquisition by Telkom and was subject to a number of prescribed conditions set out by the competition authorities i.e. one of which was to ensure minimal impact on staff retrenchments. The integration of the two organisations enabled a new and compelling value proposition to be offered to private and public business customers in the domestic market. Jeffrey Hedberg was appointed acting group chief executive officer on 7 July 2010 following Reuben September's resignation. Jeffrey was the CEO of Cell C from 2006 to 2009. However, on 13 January 2011, TechCentral reported that Hedberg would quit Telkom by the end of March 2011, citing that he felt that he would not be given the mandate he needed to fix Telkom commercially and operationally In 2013, allegations of corruption in terms of poor procurement practice, nepotism and mismanagement were unveiled. Telkom market position and ownership Telkom was managed by US-based SBC Communications (now AT&T; Inc.) from 1997 to 2004. SBC has since sold its interest in the company, after reducing operational expenditure (reducing staff resources, etc.) and increasing revenue by increased product prices, thereby increasing the share- price for greater ROI. The company is currently the market leader in the broadband space, with more than 500,000 customers on 2-40 Mbit/s DSL; it dominates the managed services market and has more than 250 corporate customers on its order book. Telkom SA operates 4.5M fixed access lines, bases on its 2008 annual report. Products and services =Telkom ADSL= Telkom provides ADSL retail services via their ISP Telkom Internet to consumer and business customers, and through Telkom Wholesale to other licensed operators. Most ISPs in South Africa, such as Afrihost, utilise Telkom's copper infrastructure for reselling ADSL services. Telkom provides ADSL with POTS. According to Telkom's figures, 92% of exchanges have been upgraded to support ADSL. Telkom is currently the largest provider of fixed-line broadband in the country, with 412 190 subscribers according to the 2008 annual report. Telkom ADSL is billed as an add-on service to a POTS voice line. A PPPoE account, which can be provided by most Internet Service Providers (ISPs), must be purchased separately to the ADSL connection for internet access. ISPs are divided into two categories, those who purchase IPConnect from Telkom and those who resell PPPoE accounts from IPConnect ISPs or Telkom themselves. IPConnect is a Telkom bit-stream access product allowing ISPs to route internet bandwidth from their ADSL subscribers over their own bandwidth. Originally, three connection rate ranges are offered (associated with different connection fees) which are \\"Fast\\" (1024/384 kbit/s), \\"Faster\\" (up to 2048/512 kbit/s), \\"Fastest\\" up to 10240/1002 kbit/s (ADSL2+)) of bandwidth for downstream/upstream respectively existed. The actual speed obtained can vary depending on line conditions. These connection rate ranges have since changed, with the minimum speed currently being 2048/512 kbit/s and mid-range 5120/512 kbit/s. Telkom have released a 10 Mbit ADSL 2+ service for a limited amount of \\"Fastest\\" users on 15 August 2010. From 18 October 2011, Telkom Internet launched business offerings, and has subsequently increased value with speed upgrades and improved prioritisation for business users, as well as converting products to include soft-capping (unlimited browsing). Telkom Internet offers business and residential SoftCap packages (as of 1 February 2012). As of 24 August 2012, \\"Faster\\" (1024 kbit/s) users started reporting speed upgrades to 2 Mbit/s (2048 kbit/s) on their ADSL Lines. As of 2 September 2012, Telkom have begun the process of trialing 40Mbit/s VDSL and FTTx. =Telkom 3G= Telkom had offered 3G products available since 2008. The coverage was initially limited to a small part of the country. Telkom entered the South African Cellular market under the brand 8ta. The public launch of the network took place on 14 October 2010 and products have been available since 18 October 2010, supporting both GSM and 3G services. Local subsidiaries Telkom Group Limited includes South African subsidiaries, Trudon (previously TDS Directory Operations) and Swiftnet, trading as FastNet. Trudon is the largest directory publisher in South Africa providing white and yellow pages directory services and electronic white pages. Swiftnet operates under the name FastNet.http://www.fastnet.co.za FastNet operates the company's Internet of Things portfolio, as well as offering point of sale and wireless connectivity options to financial, retail, agribusiness, and property management sectors. Competition Recent legislation passed by the South African government have lowered many restrictions on companies wishing to provide telecommunication access in the Republic. Competitors to the land-line monopoly have flourished, with special note given to providers of wireless broadband, who provide greater geographical penetration, by means of the technology used, than Telkom. Examples of these providers include Sentech, an extension of the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation, and WBS Co., a black owned enterprise. On 31 August 2006, Neotel (Second Network Operator) announced the launch of its services as the second national operator, initially offering wholesale international services, with plans to expand to business & residential customers within months. Neotel plans to initially use CDMA-2000 wireless technology for the last mile infrastructure due to the government and ICASA's (the regulator) inability and unwillingness to unbundle the local-loop, leading some to suggest that it's not much more than a cellular operator instead of the much needed competitor to Telkom. The three mobile telephone networks in South Africa, listed in terms of numbers of subscribers, are Vodacom (currently 65% owned by the United Kingdom's Vodafone, but until November 2008 jointly with Telkom SA), MTN and Cell C. There are several service providers, such as Virgin Mobile and Nashua Mobile, which subscribers can use to access the networks. There are approximately six times as many cellphone subscribers than land line subscribers in South Africa (30 million versus 5 million), and since these networks route their calls over their own network, GSM providers have taken a large chunk of Telkom's business, one reason for this is that many see Telkom as being an inept corporation, only interested in making money, failing to consider the customer. This is a fine example of a monopoly that would, in true free market environments, soon fail. Another promising technology is Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which may decrease the number of calls made over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) in the near future. Telkom's international calling rates are already far undercut by VoIP providers. Pan African operations Telkom (BCX) Hartebeesthoek Satellite Earth Station Telkom operates in 38 countries in Africa, from regional hubs in Nigeria and Kenya via an integrated service provider strategy . It is expanding its service portfolio across managed voice, managed data, IT services & applications, and diversifying into new revenue growth opportunities in adjacent markets. Recent acquisitions of Kenyan ISP Africa Online, and Nigerian mobile operator Multi- Links gives Telkom strategic hubs to expand data and voice services into Africa. Africa Online (AFOL) is a Pan African Internet Service Provider operating in eight countries with the 9th country through a joint-venture with Verizon South Africa. Multi-Links is a private telecommunications operator (as of 2009 a wholly owned Telkom subsidiary) with a Unified Access License allowing fixed, mobile, data, long-distance and international telecommunications services focused primarily on corporate clients in Nigeria. Via Africa Online, Telkom intends leveraging its international capacity to deploy satellite based Internet access. Through Multi-Links, Telkom is introducing converged fixed and mobile services to the Nigerian market. Criticisms =User Complaints= Telkom experiences a high volume of complaints on a daily basis (one of the highest in South Africa). Many customers in South Africa are dissatisfied with the level of service delivery. Many users indicate that if a new subscriber is looking for a service that they should turn to alternative sources as Telkom cannot deliver on their promises. FTTH is now available from several select service provides and will cut Telkom's last mile completely out of the connectivity loop. =Monopoly and state ownership= High cost of Internet access is a major point of consumer frustration in South Africa. Telkom's monopoly, backed by government investment, over fixed line provision and international access is often pointed out as the primary reason for the high costs of telecommunications. The continuing monopoly of Telkom in South Africa's communications industry, and government's large stake in the company, have been perceived by the public, consumers, and the private sector as not being in the public's best interests. The South African telecommunications regulator ICASA is overburdened and restricted in its capabilities as handed down by the Department of Communications. Telkom has a monopoly of all international calls originating within South Africa excluding VoIP, and of traffic over the SAT3 cable that provides most of South Africa's international bandwidth. The indecision over the second network operator Neotel, to Telkom's advantage, is also not considered to be in the public interest. Telkom has also attracted attention for improperly conducting itself in a contract dispute with Telcordia on account of non-delivery of an integrated FlowThru solution, resulting in a decision from the Supreme Court of Appeal against its favor in which the judge described Telkom's legal team as conducting \\"verbal manipulation\\". On 19 January 2007, a full-page advertisement was taken out in The Mail and Guardian, a national South African newspaper. Money for the ad was donated by dissatisfied South African individuals and businesses. The page was used as a public outcry, detailing some of the things Telkom has done, in hopes of bringing more attention to the current situation in South Africa's telecoms industry. The effort was organised by the Telecoms Action Group, TAG. =ADSL capping= Perhaps one of the biggest criticisms of Telkom was its introduction of a monthly traffic limit or \\"cap\\". According to Telkom, this was a measure instituted in order for the South African network not to become \\"congested\\" with an overflow of information. However, the general feeling in the South African ADSL community is that monthly traffic limits were strategically put in place by Telkom in order to obtain the maximum amount of money from ADSL users. This is mainly because Telkom offers extra bandwidth to users for a price. If the limit is exceeded during the course of the month, the ADSL connection is capped, denying international access to the web, while allowing access to local websites, until the end of the month. The user can purchase extra GBs after he/she is capped however. The typical monthly traffic limits can be used up in less than a day, even on low-speed lines. =Shaping= Another major criticism of Telkom was its institution of port prioritization or \\"shaping\\". This also was a measure introduced by Telkom in order for networks throughout South Africa not to become congested with too much information. However, port prioritization was an idea conceived mainly to benefit businesses in which employees all shared the same internet connection. Employees who used \\"bandwidth hogging\\" applications such as peer-to-peer (P2P) applications and network-intense online games often slowed down the network dramatically, preventing users who wished to browse web pages or check their mail to do so in a short space of time. Port prioritization solves this problem as it prioritizes certain ports for certain applications. It works according to a protocol which includes all ports and applications generally used in conjunction with them. These ports are sorted into a list of sorts. At the top of the list appear web browsing and email. These ports and the applications which use them receive the most bandwidth from the network. At the very bottom of the list are peer to peer applications, online games and virtual private networking (VPN). These receive very little if not no bandwidth from the network. Being unable to establish international VPN connections on the standard package has a detrimental effect on international freelancers who must pay for the much more expensive 'unshaped' service. Although it is the ideal solution for large companies, there is no choice in the shaping matter. Personal connections to the internet also get shaped. This has caused an uproar in the South African P2P and online gaming community as one has to pay over exorbitant prices (roughly two times more) to get their connections \\"unshaped.\\" =Fine= In June 2013, Telkom accepted a R200 million fine to settle complaints that it used its dominant market position to block competition from other network providers.

For background see Russian-Manchu border conflicts. The major Russian city of Khabarovsk, as well as the small town and railway station Yerofey Pavlovich (located on the Trans- Siberian railroad in Amur Oblast) bear his name. A native of the Veliky Ustyug area in the northern European Russia, Khabarov was a manager for the Stroganovs at the saltworks in Solvychegodsk. In 1625, Khabarov sailed from Tobolsk to Mangazeya. Three years later, he left the town with his expedition and reached the Kheta River (eastern part of Taimyr). In 1630, Khabarov took part in a voyage from Mangazeya to Tobolsk. In 1632--1641, he reached the Lena River and founded a farming settlement with saltworks along the Lena at the mouths of the Kuta and Kirenga Rivers. Now his descendants live in Stavropol. First Expedition 1649‚Äì50 In 1649 he became the second Russian to explore the Amur after Vassili Poyarkov (1643‚Äì1646). Poyarkov's route up the Aldan River was too difficult to be practical. At some point Khabarov attempted to reach the Amur via the Vitim River.Basil Dymytryshyn, 'Russia's Conquest of Siberia', 1985, volume one, document 75 In 1647 a hunter returned to Yakutsk from the Olyokma River and reported that this might lead to the Amur. In the spring of 1649 Khabarov set off at his own expense up the Olyokma River, then its branch, the Tungur and portaged to the Shilka River. Reaching the upper Amur (Dauria) in early 1650, he found the country nearly deserted, the cossacks' reputation having preceded them. Having pioneered a good route, he returned to Yakutsk in May, 1650 and gave his report. He praised the land, warned of the danger of Chinese intervention and suggested a larger expedition with professional soldiers. Second Expedition 1650‚Äì53 Given the time delays in communicating with Moscow, the Yakutsk Voivode Frantsbekov decided to act on his own and sent Khabarov back south with a larger force. The voivode also gave Khabarov letters from His Majesty Czar Alexis to the Daurian Prince Lavkai of Albazin and \\"Prince Bogdoi\\" () asking those potentates to submit to the Russian Czar, and threatening to send a 6,000-strong army if they don't obey. –ì—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ç–∞, –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏–∑ –Ø–∫—É—Ç—Å–∫–∞, –¥–ª—è –≤—Ä—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –µ—è, —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –•–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞, –ö–Ω—è–∑—é –ë–æ–≥–¥–æ—é, –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–∞–≥–æ –≤–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –•–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞ —Å –ê–º—É—Ä–∞, –≤ 1650 –≥. (A letter issued in Yakutsk to be handed by Khabarov to Prince Bogdoi, after Khabarov's first return from the Amur, in 1650) Dymytryshyn, document 77 Frantsbekov assumed that this Prince Bogdoy was another Siberian chieftain. He was, in fact, the Emperor of China. Khabarov crossed the mountains in the fall of 1650 and this time was met with armed resistance. He built winter quarters at Albazin at the northernmost point of the Amur. After receiving reinforcements in June 1651 he set off down the Amur. By September they reached the mouth of the Sungari. By 29 September they reached Achansk near present-day Khabarovsk and decided to winter there. On 8 October they were attacked by about 1,000 local people, who, being defeated, appealed to their Manchu overlords. On March 24, 1652, a force of 2,000 Manchus and Koreans armed with artillery arrived from Ninguta and attacked Achansk. Khabarov somehow managed to defeat them. (The Manchu general, Haise, was later executed for his incompetence) Not knowing how many more Chinese were in the area, on 22 April he withdrew up the Amur. At one point he encountered another force of 6,000 Chinese, but was able to slip around them under cover of fog and darkness.Lincoln, page 70, Further upstream he met a force of 117 cossacks who had been sent as reinforcements. He learned from a captive that a new Manchu army was being gathered on the Sungari. On August 1 he reached the mouth of the Zeya. Here 136 of his men mutinied leaving only 212 loyal. (Since Khabarov mentions the mutiny immediately after mentioning the question of where to build winter quarters, it may have been connected with the question of whether it was wise to remain on the Zeya and await a possible Manchu attack.) From the Zeya he sent a report Dymytryshyn, document 81, to the Yakutsk Voevode matter-of-factly describing the burning of villages, slaughter of natives and the torture of prisoners. From this point the English sources become unclear. They apparently wintered at the Zeya. In the fall of 1653, 150 reinforcements under Dimitry Zinoviev appeared. As a nobleman, Zinoviev demanded full command. When Khabarov refused, he was arrested. Unable to gain the support of Khabarov's men and having no adequate way to deal with the Manchus, Zinoviev and part of the force withdrew from the Amur. Onufriy Stepanov was left in charge of those who remained. Khabarov was deprived of his rank and property and was sent on a fifteen-month journey to Moscow to be tried. After a year's delay he was acquitted. He was given a minor noble rank (Syn boyarsky of Ilimsk) on the condition that he return to Siberia. He reappears again in the records in 1658 when the Siberian Office ordered that he be placed in irons if he refused to guide a new expedition to the Amur. After that he disappears from the records. Khabarov charted the Amur river in his \\"Draft of the Amur river\\" ().

Rockefeller Estate, is a 40-room historic house museum in Pocantico Hills, a hamlet in the town of Mount Pleasant, New York. The house was built for oil tycoon, and Rockefeller family patriarch John D. Rockefeller. Conceived largely by his son, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and enriched by the art collection of the third-generation scion, Governor of New York, and Vice President of the United States, Nelson Rockefeller, it was home to four generations of the family. The house is a National Historic Landmark owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and tours are given by Historic Hudson Valley. Kykuit, derived from the Dutch word Kijkuit meaning \\"lookout\\", is situated on the highest point in Pocantico Hills, overlooking the Hudson River at Tappan Zee. Located near Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, it has a view of the New York City skyline 25 miles to the south. History John D. Rockefeller purchased land in the area as early as 1893 after his brother William had moved into a 204-room mansion, Rockwood Hall, in the area. When Rockefeller and his son chose Pocantico Hills as their residence, he quietly purchased multiple homes and properties in the area, and used the houses for himself, his family, staff, or to rent out. Rockefeller and his wife Laura Spelman Rockefeller moved into one of these houses, the Parsons-Wentworth House, in 1893. The couple would spend winter weekends and parts of each summer and fall there, sharing the upstairs rooms with their adult children and in-laws, pending construction of the manor house. The house burned down on September 17, 1902, and the Kent House became their temporary residence until rebuilding could occur. The New York Times described that Rockefeller was never satisfied with the destroyed house's electric wiring, which was installed before certain safety measures were developed. He had ordered workers to line the wires in piping, work which was to commence the day after the fire. The loss was estimated at $40,000. Kykuit was designed originally as a steep-roofed three-story stone mansion by the architects Chester Holmes Aldrich and William Adams Delano. Aldrich was a distant relative of the younger Rockefeller's wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, who was involved as artistic consultant and in the interior design of the mansion. The initial eclectic structure took six years to complete. Before being occupied it was substantially rebuilt in its present four-story Classical Revival Georgian form. Completed in 1913, it has two basement levels filled with interconnecting passageways and service tunnels. The home's interiors were designed by Ogden Codman, Jr., and feature collections of Chinese and European ceramics, fine furnishings and 20th-century art. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and In 1979, its occupant, Nelson Rockefeller, bequeathed upon his death his one-third interest in the estate to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. As a result, Kykuit is open to the public for toursNew York Times, 2003: The Estate Next Door conducted by Historic Hudson Valley. The imposing structure, of local stone topped with the Rockefeller emblem, is located centrally in a inner compound (referred to as \\"the Park\\") within the larger Rockefeller family estate. This gated compound is guarded at all times. Save family residences, the rest of the estate (known as the open space) is open to the public for recreational purposes, as it always has been.  Gardens  Southwestern exposure of Kykuit One of several gardens Kykuit's tea house Initially, landscaping of the grounds was given to the company of Frederick Law Olmsted, who had designed Manhattan's Central Park. Rockefeller Senior was unhappy with this work however and assumed control of the design himself, transplanting whole mature trees, designing lookouts and the several scenic winding roads. In 1906, the further design of Kykuit's grounds was undertaken by the architect William Welles Bosworth, who designed the surrounding terraces and gardens with fountains, pavilions and classical sculpture. These gardens in the Beaux-Arts style are considered Bosworth's best work in the United States, looking out over very fine views of the Hudson River. His original gardens still exist, with plantings carefully replaced over time, although his entrance forecourt was extended in 1913. The terraced gardens include a Morning Garden, Grand Staircase, Japanese Garden, Italian Garden, Japanese-style brook, Japanese Tea-house, large Oceanus fountain, Temple of Aphrodite, loggia, and semicircular rose garden. Nelson transformed previously empty basement passages beneath the mansion that lead to a grotto into a major private art gallery containing paintings by Picasso, Chagall and Warhol, the latter two having visited the estate. Between 1935 and the late 1970s more than 120 works of abstract, avant garde and modern sculpture were added to the gardens grounds from Nelson's collection, including works by Picasso ('Bathers'), Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Karel Appel ('Mouse on Table'), Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti, Georg Kolbe ('Ruf der Erde'), Gaston Lachaise, Aristide Maillol, Henry Moore, Louise Nevelson, Isamu Noguchi ('Black Sun'), and David Smith. Kykuit was renovated and modernized in 1995 by New Haven architect Herbert S. Newman and Partners. Included were major infrastructure changes enabling the estate to accommodate group tours of the first floor and art gallery, as well as a reconfiguration of third and fourth floor staff quarters into guest suites. Public tours The inner park area was opened to restricted conducted tours of the mansion and immediate surrounds in 1994, but remains occupied and controlled by the family by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which leased the area from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1991 and serves as steward of what is referred to as \\"the historic area\\". Public tours are conducted by Historic Hudson Valley, an organization established in 1951 by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. \\"to celebrate the region's history, architecture, landscape, and material culture, advancing its importance and thereby assuring its preservation.\\" Shuttle vans run from a visitor center located at the Philipsburg Manor House on Route 9 in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Pocantico, the family estate View from Kykuit's entryway The dining room The music hall The estate, known as Pocantico or Pocantico Hills, occupies an area of . During much of the 20th century, the estate featured a resident workforce of security guards, gardeners, and laborers, and had its own farming, cattle, and food supplies. It has a nine-hole, reversible golf course, and at one time had 75 houses and 70 private roads, most designed by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. and his son. A longstanding witticism about the estate quips: \\"It's what God would have built, if only He had the money\\". In 1901, John D. Rockefeller, Sr. hired golf course architect Willie Dunn, the designer of Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, to build a golf course on the grounds. In late 1946, two of Junior's sons, John D. Rockefeller III and Laurance Rockefeller, each offered their respective residences, Rockwood Hall and Fieldwood Farm, as headquarters for the then newly formed United Nations. Family patriarch Junior vetoed the proposals as the sites were too isolated from Manhattan. He tasked his second son, Nelson, to buy a site along the East River, subsequently donated for the construction of the UN Headquarters. Among guests hosted by Nelson and his brother David have been Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan, and their wives. Other notable visitors have included UN President Kofi Annan, President of the Republic of South Africa Nelson Mandela, Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, King Hussein of Jordan, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, and Lord Mountbatten of Burma of the United Kingdom.Prominent visitors to the estate, including Chagall and Warhol -- Roberts, op.cit. (p.34). At present, 10 or so Rockefeller families live within the estate, in the central compound and beyond. Much land has been donated over the decades to New York State, including the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, and is open to the public for horseback riding, biking, and jogging. Bill Clinton, who lives just north of the estate, in Chappaqua, has taken regular runs in the State Park. =Residences= Within the park: *\\"Hawes House\\", home of Nelson Rockefeller *\\"Kent House\\", home of Laurance Rockefeller Outside the park: *\\"Abeyton Lodge\\", home of John D.

It is three times the size of the Kykuit mansion. It still houses an impressive collection of horse-drawn carriages, and an equally noteworthy collection of 12 family-owned vintage cars for public viewing, graphically illustrating the development of automotive design from the early to the mid- twentieth century.Coach Barn and vehicles illustrating auto design - Ibid., (p.98) In 1994, with funding from David Rockefeller and brother Laurance, its lower floor was converted by the New Haven architects Herbert S. Newman and Partners into a modern, fully equipped meeting facility for the Fund's conferences, with limited overnight accommodation on the upper floor. The facilities, furthering the projects and objectives of the RBF through conferences, seminars, workshops and retreats for RBF staff, are also available to both domestic and foreign nonprofit organizations, including annual gatherings of all the major foundation presidents and UN Security Council officials, among numerous other dignitaries.Pocantico Conferences and the Coach Barn - Ibid., (pp.13-14, 47-48); See also the Rockefeller Brothers Fund official website list of Conferences in External Links. *The \\"Playhouse\\", the family seat. In the park, this is the location, since 1994, of the regular semi-annual family meetings, in June and December. :A rambling French Norman two-story structure completed by Junior during 1927, this structure is also three times the size of the Kykuit mansion. Standing alongside the nine-hole, reversible golf course, an outdoor swimming pool and two tennis courts, it contains an indoor swimming pool and tennis court, fully equipped basketball gym, squash court, billiard room and full-size bowling alley. It also has dining and living rooms, and a huge reception room resembling an English baronial hall. *The Orangerie, housing citrus plants, this is modeled after the original at the Palace of Versailles *Breuer Guest House, a modern house that was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, then disassembled, shipped to, and reassembled at the estate. *Underground Bomb Shelter, the location of cabinet papers and private telephone transcripts delivered to the estate during 1973 - and kept there for an unknown period of time - by the then Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger.Kissinger's cabinet documents delivered to the estate - see Walter Isaacson, Kissinger: A Biography, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1992, (updated, 2005) (pp.231-32); Seymour Hersh, The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House, New York: Summit, 1983 (pp.112, 316, 479). *The Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture, outside the park, this was opened by David Rockefeller and Peggy Dulany during 2004 Stone Barns Official Site and was established in memory of Rockefeller's wife, Peggy. It is a not-for-profit agricultural and educational facility on of farmland, in the middle of the family-donated Rockefeller State Park Preserve, allied to the family-funded Pocantico Central School. It sells organic local produce, meat and eggs to the nearby public for-profit restaurant, Blue Hill, as well as to local businesses in the Pocantico Hills area. *The Rockefeller Archive Center, a voluminous three-story underground bunker built below the foundations of the Hillcrest mansion of Martha Baird Rockefeller, situated just outside the Park area. This is an impressively equipped repository of 150-plus years of Rockefeller papers, memorabilia and other outside organizations' collections. It is staffed by ten full-time archivists who patrol forty-foot-long shelves on rails, and it contains, for researchers, the publicly restricted and expurgated family history.The vetted and expurgated family archives available to researchers in the underground bunker - see Cary Reich, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds to Conquer, 1908-1958, New York: Doubleday, 1996. (pp.774-75) Additionally, family members have had a profound effect on the hamlet of Pocantico Hills, which is situated in the open space of the estate completely surrounded by family-owned land. The Union Church of Pocantico Hills, now owned by Historic Hudson Valley, was built by the Rockefeller family, which commissioned stained-glass windows by Matisse (an abstract rose window, memorializing Abby Aldrich), and Chagall (the remainder of the windows, emphasizing Biblical prophets and some New Testament themes, and memorializing various members of the family and others). They also helped finance the construction of the local Pocantico Hills School.

After leaving school he studied for some years under Louis Cabat, the landscape painter. Fromentin was one of the earliest pictorial interpreters of Algeria, having been able, while quite young, to visit the land and people that suggested the subjects of most of his works, and to store his memory as well as his portfolio with the picturesque and characteristic details of North African life. In 1849, he was awarded a medal of the second class. In 1852, he paid a second visit to Algeria, accompanying an archaeological mission, and then completed that minute study of the scenery of the country and of the habits of its people which enabled him to give to his after-work the realistic accuracy that comes from intimate knowledge. His books include ' (\\"The Masters of Past Time\\", 1876), an influential appreciation of Early Netherlandish painting and the Northern Baroque of the Old Masters of Belgium and Holland, Dominique and A Summer in the Sahara. In ' he deals with the complexity of paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt and others, their style and the artists' emotions at the time of creating their masterpieces. He is also one of the first \\"art critics\\" to approach the subject of The Old Masters from a personal point of view - being a painter himself. He also puts the work in a social, political and economic context, as the Dutch Golden Age painting develops shortly after Holland won its independence. The book developed from articles for journals. Meyer Schapiro has written an essay on Fromentin, \\"Eugene Fromentin as Critic\\".Eugene Fromentin as Critic - Meyer Schapiro, Theory and Philosophy of Art: Style, Artist and Society, Selected Papers, George Braziller, New York, 1994.

Among his more important works are: * ' √† Constantine (1849) * ' (1853) * ' (1859) * ' (1859) * ' (1859) * ' (1861) * ' (1863) * ' (1863) * ' (now at Luxembourg) (1863) * ' (1865) * ' (1867) * ' (1868) * ' (1869) * Le Nil (1875) * ' (1875) Chasse au h√©ron Fromentin Mus√©e Cond√©.jpgHunting heron, Algeria, 1865 Eug√®ne Fromentin 001.jpgArabs, 1871 Eug√®ne Fromentin - Marokkaanse ruiters aan de voet van de Chiffrarots.jpgMoroccan Horsemen at the Foot of the Chiffra Cliffs Eug√®ne Fromentin 002.jpgUn Souvenir d'Esneh, 1876 Fromentin, who maintained that \\"art is the expression of the invisible by means of the visible\\", was much influenced in style by Eug√®ne Delacroix. His works are distinguished by striking composition, great dexterity of handling and brilliancy of colour. In them is given with great truth and refinement the unconscious grandeur of barbarian and animal attitudes and gestures. His later works, however, show signs of an exhausted vein and of an exhausted spirit, accompanied or caused by physical enfeeblement. But it must be observed that Fromentin's paintings show only one side of a genius that was perhaps even more felicitously expressed in literature, though with less profusion. Dominique, first published in the Revue des deux mondes in 1862, and dedicated to George Sand, is remarkable among the fiction of the century for delicate and imaginative observation and for emotional earnestness. Fromentin's other literary works are Visites artistiques (1852); Simples P√®lerinages (1856); Un √©t√© dans le Sahara (1857); Une ann√©e dans le Sahel (1858). In 1876 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Academy. He died suddenly at La Rochelle on August 27, 1876.

Overview Harkness method is in use at many American boarding schools and colleges and encourages classes to be held in a discursive manner. The style is related to the Socratic method. Developed at Phillips Exeter Academy, the method's name comes from the oil magnate and philanthropist Edward Harkness, who presented the school with a monetary gift in 1930. It has been adopted in numerous schools, where small class-size makes it effective, but it remains impractical for larger classes. There are also downsides for students who are not good in taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom. Harkness described its use as follows: :What I have in mind is [a classroom] where [students] could sit around a table with a teacher who would talk with them and instruct them by a sort of tutorial or conference method, where [each student] would feel encouraged to speak up. This would be a real revolution in methods.Christophe G. Courchesne, \\"'A Suggestion of a Fundamental Nature': Imagining a Legal Education of Solely Electives Taught as Discussions\\", Rutgers Law Record 29, no. 21 (2005): 26. Harkness practices can vary, most notably between humanities subjects such as English and history and technical subjects such as math and physics. There are general principles and goals, however, that go along with that method regardless of subject matter. The main goal is to encourage students to develop strong listening and critical thinking skills. Depending on style, the teacher may interact very little, interjecting only to guide the discussion. = Whole Group Discussion Method = The Whole Group Discussion Technique follows the Harkness Method. It involves interaction throughout the class instead of the teacher simply delivering a lecture while students listen passively. Many teachers today prefer this approach because of heightened communication between the mentor and students. There are advantages and disadvantages in using this method. Auditory learners find this style more interesting. They are able to keep information completely since sounds reinforce the information. This process includes use of musical notes, memorization of lists, voice recordings, and chants for memorizing history terms. Teachers are able to check what students retain through questioning. Students can concentrate on their lessons and feel more at ease in asking questions during discussions. However, the Whole Group Discussion approach calls for effective classroom management by teachers. Otherwise, it may be difficult for them to implement ground rules for students. There are also downsides for students who are not good at taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom. There are strategies in effective implementation of Whole Group Discussions. The Think-Pair-Share is commonly used for lower elementary pupils to persuade the children in acquiring listening and speaking skills. Philosophical Chairs is another strategy wherein teachers read sentences or topics with only two likely responses. It is either agree or disagree. Each group of students defends the position it adopted. Fishbowl is one of the most popular classroom discussion techniques. A group of two up to four students sit facing one another at the center of the classroom. The other students sit around their peers. Those at the middle discuss the selected subject matter or question while the others take notes related to the dialogue. The other strategies include Concentric Circles Strategy, Gallery Walk, Pyramid Strategy, and Carousel Walk. References External links *'Edward S. Harkness, 1874-1940', Richard F.

The IBM 1132 line printer was the normal printer for the IBM 1130 computer system. It printed 120 character lines at 80 lines per minute. The character set consisted of numbers, upper-case letters and some special characters. The 1965-introduced 1132 was built around a stripped down IBM 407 printing mechanism.The 407 was introduced 1949 The 407 was IBM's top-of-the-line accounting machine from the 1950s. The 1130 had 120 power transistors, each wired to the print magnet for one printer column. The magnet released a lever that engaged a cam with a spinning clutch shaft. The engaged cam then made one revolution, pushing its print wheel toward the ribbon and paper, thereby printing one character. As the set of 120 print wheels spun, the 1130 received an interrupt as each of the possible 48 characters was about to move into position. The printing driver software had to quickly output a 120 bit vector designating which transistors were to fire so as to drive the print wheel against the ribbon and paper. This put a big performance burden on the CPU, but resulted in an inexpensive (for the time) printer. Sometimes a printer output line transistor would fail, resulting in a blank print position. If you knew your way around inside the 1130, it was possible to swap circuit cards so as to move the bad print position to near the right end of the printed line. This kept the 1130 usable until the repair person showed up. The 1132 came in two models with the following characteristics:Model 1 @ 80 Lines/minute, Model 2 @ 40 LPM: * Standard 48-character-set typewheels with A..Z, 0..9 and the symbols \`. , + - * / = ( ) ' $ &\`. * Model 1 prints up to 80 alphameric or 110 numeric lines per minute and can be attached to 1131 CPU Models 1, 2, 3, and 5. * Model 2 prints up to 40 alphameric or 55 numeric lines per minute and may be attached only to the 1131 CPU Model 4. * Standard 120 print-line positions spaced 10 characters per inch. * Operator selection of vertical line spacing, 6 or 8 lines per inch. * Forms skipping under program control through automatic, paper-tape-controlled carriage. * Printer operation under stored- program control through automatic interrupt system. * Direct connection to the 1131 Central Processing Unit by means of the 1132 Printer Attachment and an Expansion Adapter.

He took the name \\"Geronimo,\\" after a prominent Apache chief and leader of resistance to US domination, and \\"Ji- Jaga,\\" after a Central African tribe. In 1971, his wife Saundra was killed when she was 8 months pregnant and her body was left in a ditch. The murder was attributed at the time to a BPP schism between supporters of Huey Newton and those of Eldridge Cleaver; Pratt and his wife belonged to the Cleaver faction.

Another FBI memo, dated five months later, noted that the Bureau was constantly considering counterintelligence measures designed to neutralize Pratt \\"as an effective (Panther) functionary.\\" Murder charges In 1968, Caroline Olsen, a 27-year- old elementary school teacher, was murdered by gunshot during a robbery on a Santa Monica tennis court. Olsen's husband, Kenneth, who was also shot but survived, identified Pratt as the killer in an eyewitness line-up. Julius Butler, a police informant and infiltrator inside the Black Panther Party, testified that Pratt had confessed to him and discussed the murder with him on several occasions. In 1970, Pratt was arrested and charged with murder and kidnapping. His attorney, Johnnie Cochran, argued that the charges should be dropped. He claimed that Pratt had been 350 miles away on the night of the murder. Pratt was convicted in 1972.

Attorney Stuart Hanlon, who had helped represent him in his first trial, and William Paparian worked on the appeals that resulted in Pratt's conviction being vacated. In an interview with Reuters he recalled being held in solitary confinement in a cell near cult leader Charles Manson, with only ants to keep him company. Murder conviction vacated The conviction was vacated on June 10, 1997, on the grounds that the prosecution had concealed evidence that might have influenced the jury's verdict. Police wiretaps showed that he was present at a Black Panther meeting in Oakland, 400 miles away from the murder in L.A. at the time of the murder. The prosecution had not disclosed the extent to which a key witness against Pratt, Julius Butler, was an informant to the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department. The state appealed the decision, but an appeals court in 1999 ruled this fact to be \\"'favorable' to the defendant, 'suppressed' by a law enforcement agency, and 'material' to the jury's decision to convict;\\" it upheld the decision to vacate the conviction, freeing him.In re Pratt, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 260 (Cal.App. 2 Dist.1999)\\" Retrieved July 22, 2014 On July 24, 1997, Pratt returned to his hometown of Morgan City, Louisiana, to see his aged mother, Eunice.

He won a share of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Haldan Keffer Hartline and Ragnar Granit.  Research  Wald plotted the absorbance of rod pigment (black curve), then later the absorbance of cone pigments (red, green, and blue curves) As a postdoctoral researcher, Wald discovered that vitamin A was a component of the retina. His further experiments showed that when the pigment rhodopsin was exposed to light, it yielded the protein opsin and a compound containing vitamin A. This suggested that vitamin A was essential in retinal function. In the 1950s, Wald and his colleagues used chemical methods to extract pigments from the retina. Then, using a spectrophotometer, they were able to measure the light absorbance of the pigments. Since the absorbance of light by retina pigments corresponds to the wavelengths that best activate photoreceptor cells, this experiment showed the wavelengths that the eye could best detect. However, since rod cells make up most of the retina, what Wald and his colleagues were specifically measuring was the absorbance of rhodopsin, the main photopigment in rods. Later, with a technique called microspectrophotometry, he was able to measure the absorbance directly from cells, rather than from an extract of the pigments. This allowed Wald to determine the absorbance of pigments in the cone cells (Goldstein, 2001).  Biography  George Wald with wife Ruth Hubbard in 1967 George Wald was born in New York City, the son of Ernestine (Rosenmann) and Isaac Wald, Jewish immigrant parents. He was a member of the first graduating class of the Brooklyn Technical High School in New York in 1923. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from New York University in 1927 and his PhD in zoology from Columbia University in 1932. After graduating, he received a travel grant from the US National Research Council. Wald used this grant to work in Germany with Otto Heinrich Warburg where he identified vitamin A in the retina. Wald then went on to work in Zurich, Switzerland with the discoverer of vitamin A, Paul Karrer. Wald then worked briefly with Otto Fritz Meyerhof in Heidelberg, Germany, but left Europe for the University of Chicago in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power and life in Europe became more dangerous for Jews. In 1934, Wald went to Harvard University where he became an instructor, then a professor. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1950 and in 1967 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries in vision. In 1966 he was awarded the Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA and in 1967 the Paul Karrer Gold Medal of the University of Zurich. life on other planets in Who's Out There? (1973). Wald spoke out on many political and social issues and his fame as a Nobel laureate brought national and international attention to his views. He was a pacifist and vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and the nuclear arms race. Speaking at MIT in 1969 Wald bemoaned that \\"Our government has become preoccupied with death, with the business of killing and being killed.\\"Norman Solomon (September 6, 2010) A Speech for Endless War. zcommunications.org In 1980, Wald served as part of Ramsey Clark's delegation to Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. With a small number of other Nobel laureates, he was invited in 1986 to fly to Moscow to advise Mikhail Gorbachev on a number of environmental questions. While there, he questioned Gorbachev about the arrest, detention and exile of Yelena Bonner and her husband, fellow Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov (Peace prize, 1975). Wald reported that Gorbachev said he knew nothing about it. Bonner and Sakharov were released shortly thereafter, in December 1986. A member of the Circumcision resource center in Boston, he was one of the first scientists committed against circumcision but his article \\"Circumcision\\", rejected by the New York Times in 1975, was published in 2012 only by an English magazine (http://churchandstate.org.uk/2012/12/what-jewish-nobelist-george-wald-had-to- say-about-circumcision/). Wald died in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was married twice: in 1931 to Frances Kingsley (1906-1980) and in 1958 to the biochemist Ruth Hubbard. He had two sons with Kingsley‚ÄîMichael and David; he and Hubbard had a son‚Äîthe award-winning musicologist and musician Elijah Wald‚Äîand a daughter, Deborah, a prominent family law attorney.

Early in his career he painted in a Neoclassical style close to that of his teacher Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, but in his later works he was strongly influenced by the Romantic style of Eug√®ne Delacroix. He was a prolific draftsman, and made a suite of prints to illustrate Shakespeare's Othello. Life and work The Toilette of Esther, 1841, oil on canvas, 45.5 x 35.5 cm, Paris, Louvre Chass√©riau was born in El Lim√≥n, Saman√°, in the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic).Gu√©gan et al. 2002, p. 163. His father Beno√Æt Chass√©riau was a French adventurer who had arrived in Santo Domingo in 1802 to take an administrative position in what was until 1808 a French colony.Gu√©gan et al. 2002, pp. 58, 163. Theodore's mother, Maria Magdalena Couret de la Blagni√©re, was the daughter of a mulatto landowner born in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). In December 1820 the family left Santo Domingo for Paris, where the young Chass√©riau soon showed precocious drawing skill. He was accepted into the studio of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres in 1830, at the age of eleven, and became the favorite pupil of the great classicist, who regarded him as his truest disciple.Gu√©gan et al. 2002, p. 168. (An account that may be apocryphal has Ingres declaring \\"Come, gentlemen, come see, this child will be the Napoleon of painting.\\")Gu√©gan et al. 2002, pp. 60, 168. After Ingres left Paris in 1834 to become director of the French Academy in Rome, Chass√©riau fell under the influence of Eug√®ne Delacroix, whose brand of painterly colorism was anathema to Ingres. Chass√©riau's art has often been characterized as an attempt to reconcile the classicism of Ingres with the romanticism of Delacroix.Rosenblum 1989, p. 32. He first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1836, and was awarded a third-place medal in the category of history painting.Gu√©gan et al. 2002, p. 170. In 1840 Chass√©riau travelled to Rome and met with Ingres, whose bitterness at the direction his student's work was taking led to a decisive break. While in Italy, Chass√©riau made landscape sketches and studied Renaissance frescoes.Rosenthal. V√©nus marine dite V√©nus Anadyom√®ne, 1838, Paris, Louvre Androm√®de attach√©e au rocher par les N√©r√©ides, 1840, Paris, Louvre Macbeth and Banquo Meeting the Witches on the Heath, 1855. An example of one of Chass√©riau's many works inspired by Shakespeare The Two Sisters, 1843, Paris, Louvre Portrait of Reverend Father Henri-Dominique Lacordaire, 1840, Paris, Louvre Portrait d'Alexis de Tocqueville, 1850 Among the chief works of his early maturity are Susanna and the Elders and Venus Anadyomene (both 1839), Diana Surprised by Actaeon (1840), Andromeda Chained to the Rock by the Nereids (1840), and The Toilette of Esther (1841), all of which reveal a very personal ideal in depicting the female nude.Gu√©gan et al. 2002, p. 53. Chass√©riau's major religious paintings from these years, Christ on the Mount of Olives (a subject he treated in 1840 and again in 1844) and The Descent from the Cross (1842), received mixed reviews from the critics; among the artist's champions was Th√©ophile Gautier. In 1843, Chass√©riau painted murals depicting the life of Saint Mary of Egypt in the Church of Saint-Merri in Paris, the first of several commissions he received to decorate public buildings in Paris. Portraits from this period include the Portrait of the Reverend Father Dominique Lacordaire, of the Order of the Predicant Friars (1840), and The Two Sisters (1843), which depicts Chass√©riau's sisters Ad√®le and Aline. Throughout his life he was a prolific draftsman; his many portrait drawings executed with a finely pointed graphite pencil are close in style to those of Ingres.Prat 1989, p. 5. He also created a body of 29 prints, including a group of eighteen etchings of subjects from Shakespeare's Othello in 1844.Fisher 1979, p. 13. He exhibited the colossal portrait Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort in the Salon of 1845, where it received equivocal reviews. In 1846, Chass√©riau made his first trip to Algeria. From sketches made on this and subsequent trips he painted such subjects as Arab Chiefs Visiting Their Vassals and Jewish Women on a Balcony (both 1849, now in the Louvre). A major late work, The Tepidarium (1853, in the Mus√©e d'Orsay), depicts a large group of women drying themselves after bathing, in an architectural setting inspired by the artist's trip in 1840 to Pompeii. His most monumental work was his decoration of the grand staircase of the Cour des Comptes, commissioned by the state in 1844 and completed in 1848. He followed the example of Delacroix in executing this work in oil on plaster, rather than in fresco. This work was heavily damaged in May 1871 by a fire set during the Commune, and only fragments could be recovered; these are preserved in the Louvre. After a period of ill health, exacerbated by his exhausting work on commissions for murals to decorate the Churches of Saint-Roch and Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, Chass√©riau died at the age of 37 in Paris, on October 8, 1856. He is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery. Legacy His work had a significant impact on the style of Puvis de Chavannes and Gustave Moreau, and‚Äîthrough those artists' influence‚Äîreverberations in the work of Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse.Gu√©gan et al. 2002, p. 287. There is in Paris a Society for the painter: Association des Amis de Th√©odore Chass√©riau. Works of Chass√©riau are in the Mus√©e du Louvre where a room is dedicated to him, in the Mus√©e d'Orsay, and in the Mus√©e de Versailles. Collections in the United States holding works by Th√©odore Chass√©riau include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, the National Gallery of Art of Washington, D.C., the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of the Art Rhode Island School of Design, The J.

He also served as the 33rd Mayor of Winnipeg on two occasions. Background Queen was born at Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1882, the son of John Queen and Jane Todd, both natives of Scotland. A cooper by trade, he arrived in Canada in 1906 with his younger brother William, moving into a rooming house at 259 Dorothy St., a stone's throw from the massive Canadian Pacific Railway yards where many working-class Scottish and English immigrants were then employed.See Census of the Prairie Provinces, 1906, for Winnipeg Sub-district 5D, p. 71, lines 11-12. He operated a horse-drawn delivery wagon for a laundry. On June 25, 1908,See Manitoba Vital Statistics website. Queen married Katherine Ross, who had herself emigrated from Scotland in 1907. By 1911 the family, which by then included a son John and a daughter Gloria (later Gloria Queen-Hughes, a prominent feminist and mayoral candidate), were living in the working-class neighbourhood of Weston.See Census of Canada, 1911 , for Winnipeg Enumeration District 69, p. 31, lines 41-45. Political activism Queen soon became involved in the radical politics of Winnipeg. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Canada in 1908, as the group was breaking away from the more doctrinaire Socialist Party of Canada. Queen's own variety of socialism was undogmatic, and was strongly influenced by the reform liberalism of John Stuart Mill. City council Queen was elected to the Winnipeg City Council in 1916, and served on this body representing Ward Five until 1919. In this capacity, he argued for a more progressive tax system, and defended the rights of returning soldiers. He had intended to run for federal office in 1917, but stood aside in the interest of labour unity. Queen was a leading figure in the Winnipeg General Strike, and received a one-year jail sentence for \\"seditious conspiracy\\" in 1920. This did not hurt his popularity among the city's workers, and he was elected to the Manitoba Legislature in 1920 and later served as mayor of Winnipeg.Edmonton Bulletin, April 28, Dec. 4, 1920 Elected to provincial legislature In June 1920 while still serving his prison term he was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the ten-member district of Winnipeg. After taking his seat in 1921, he supported a motion to allow \\"peaceful picketing\\" within the province; this motion was defeated. The SDPC ceased to exist in 1920. Queen was re-elected in 1922 as an \\"Independent Workers\\" candidate, and subsequently joined the Independent Labour Party. When Fred Dixon resigned in 1923, Queen became the ILP's parliamentary leader. Canada's labour movement experienced several setbacks in the late 1920s, and the ILP was not an especially strong electoral force during Queen's time as leader. Only three party members were elected in 1927, all from Winnipeg‚ÄîQueen, William Ivens and Seymour Farmer. The party fared slightly better in 1932, winning four seats in Winnipeg (electing Ivens, Farmer, Hyman and Queen) and taking St. Boniface from veteran Conservative MLA Joseph Bernier. The party made little headway beyond urban areas, however, and remained a relatively small opposition group to the Progressive government of John Bracken. Mayor After failed attempts in 1932 and 1933, Queen was elected mayor of Winnipeg in 1934 (defeating John McKerchar, the candidate of the city's business interests). Queen again campaigned in favour of progressive taxation, and spoke out against a proposed tax reduction for various businesses within the city. Following his election, he passed a tax reform bill that provided for a significant increase in the city's revenues. Queen served as mayor from 1935 to 1936, and again from 1937 to 1942. He did not endorse many explicitly socialist policies during his period in office, instead favouring more general programs of civic improvement. Queen's housing reforms were upheld as a model for the rest of the nation, and he held leading positions in the Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities. Later political career Queen continued to serve in the provincial legislature during his tenure as mayor, though he turned over the leadership of the party to Seymour Farmer in 1935. Along with the rest of the ILP caucus, he became affiliated with the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in 1933. His defeat in the provincial election of 1941 seems to have been unexpected. Queen was also defeated as Winnipeg's mayor in 1942, and lost another bid in 1944. Strong opposition from Winnipeg's Communists was undoubtedly a contributing factor in both cases. He died at home in Winnipeg on July 15, 1946.

The Stanley family later gained the title Earl of Derby and remained prominent in English history into modern times. He married a wealthy heiress, Isabel Lathom, which, combined with his own great abilities, allowed him to rise above the usual status of a younger son. Origins He was the second son of Sir William Stanley of Stourton (son of Sir John de Stanley and Emma Lathom of Lathom, Lancashire.John Stanley, Dictionary of National Biography) by his wife Alice Massey of Timperley, Cheshire. Sir William Stanley was Master-Forester of the Forest of Wirral and was notorious for his repressive activities. Marriage and children Arms of Lathom of Lathom: Or, on a chief indented azure three plates. Quartered by Stanley, Earls of Derby In 1385 he married Isabel Lathom, daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Lathom of Lathom in Lancashire, a great landowner in south-west Lancashire and a great-great-great-grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. The marriage took place despite the opposition of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and gave Stanley great wealth he could never have hoped for as the younger son. By his wife, he had four sons and two daughters, including: *Sir John Stanley (died 1437), eldest son and heir; *Henry Stanley; *Thomas Stanley; *Ralph Stanley Crest of Lathom Heraldic crest of Lathom: An eagle wings extended or preying on a child proper swaddled gules in a cradle laced or,Montague-Smith, P.W.

An ancient myth (\\"the Stanley Legend\\"), of several varieties, is attached to the image depicted, one given by Thomas Stanley (died circa 1568), Bishop of Sodor and Man being that the \\"Lord of Lathom\\" was issueless and aged \\"fowerscore\\" adopted an infant \\"swaddled and clad in a mantle of redd,\\" which an eagle brought unhurt to her nest in Terlestowe wood, and which he named Oskell, and made heir of Lathom, where he became the father of Isabel Stanley, stolen away in the first instance by her knight, and afterwards forgiven by Sir Oskell\\". Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica, \\"On the Stanley Legend and Family of Lathom\\" The Stanley crest is today memorialised in the name of several English public houses displaying the sign of \\"The Eagle and Child\\", often situated within manors once held by the Stanley family. Career =Declared an outlaw= Both John Stanley and his elder brother, William Stanley (who succeeded their father as Master-Forester), were involved in criminal cases which charged them with a forced entry in 1369 and with the murder of Thomas Clotton in 1376. Conviction for the murder of Clotton resulted in Stanley being declared an outlaw. However, he was already distinguishing himself in military service in the French wars, and he was pardoned in 1378 at the insistence of his commander, Sir Thomas Trivet. =Justiciar of Ireland= The year 1386 saw his first appointment in Ireland as deputy to Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland. This occurred because of the insurrection created by the friction between Sir Philip de Courtenay, the English Lieutenant of Ireland, and his appointed governor James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond. Stanley led an expedition to Ireland on behalf of de Vere and King Richard II to quell it. He was accompanied by Bishop Alexander de Balscot of Meath and Sir Robert Crull.Rolls of 9 Richard II ‚Äì Part II. Membrane 1, cont. 18 June 1386 Westminister {as before Membrane 6, 163 Butler joined them upon their arrival in Ireland.

CIRCLE A Calendar of Irish Chancery Letters c. 1244‚Äì1509: http://chancery.tcd.ie/document/patent/10-richard-ii/34 In 1389 Richard II appointed him Justiciar of Ireland, a post he held until 1391. He was heavily involved in Richard's first expedition to Ireland in 1394‚Äì1395. Throughout the 1390s he was involved in placating possible rebellion in Cheshire. Between 1396 and 1398 he served as Captain of Roxburgh Castle. He took part in Richard II's expedition to Ireland in 1399. However, on his return to England, Stanley, who had long proved adept at political manoeuvring, turned his back on Richard and submitted to King Henry IV, the first of the House of Lancaster. =Under the Lancastrians= Stanley's fortunes were equally good under the Lancastrians. He was granted lordships in the Welsh Marches, and served a term as Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1403 he was made Steward of the Household of Henry, Prince of Wales, (later Henry V). Unlike many of the Cheshire gentry, he took the side of the king in the rebellion of the Percys. He was wounded in the throat at the Battle of Shrewsbury. In 1405 he was granted the tenure of the Isle of Man, which had been confiscated from the rebellious Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. In this period he also became Steward of the Household to King Henry IV, and was appointed by him a Knight of the Garter. In 1413 King Henry V of England sent him to serve once more as Lieutenant of Ireland. Death and burial In 1414 he died at Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, after being satirised by the O'Higgins' of Meath for despoiling the lands and raiding the cows of Niall O'Higgins. He lasted but five weeks, according to the Four Masters, before succumbing \\"to the virulence of the lampoons\\". His body was returned to his home at Lathom and was buried at Burscough Priory near Ormskirk, about 3 miles south-west of Lathom. This was deemed in some quarters the second such \\"Poet's Miracle\\" performed by the O'Higgins. Offices During his career Stanley held the following offices:- * Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1386 and 1388. * Justiciary Ireland between 1389 and 1391. * Justice of Chester in 1394 * Controller of the Royal Household in 1399 * Lieutenant of Ireland between 1399 and 1401 * Steward of the Household to the Prince of Wales circa 1403, later King Henry V * Surveyor of the Forests of Macclesfield, Mare and Mondrem, Cheshire in 1403 * Governor of the City and County of Cheshire in 1403 * He was invested as a Knight, Order of the Garter (K.G.) circa 1405 * Steward of Macclesfield in 1406 He was granted the Isle, Castle, Peel and Lordship of Mann, by King Henry IV of England * Sovereign Lord of the Isle of Man in 1406 * Constable of Windsor Castle in 1409 * Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (second term) from 1413 until his death in 1414. Poet It has been suggested that Stanley was the as-yet unidentified \\"Gawain Poet\\".

Filmation was the production company for the series. The show premiered in 1972William Henry Cosby, \\"An Integration of the Visual Media Via \\"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\\" into the Elementary School Curriculum as a Teaching Aid and Vehicle to Achieve Increased Learning\\" (January 1, 1976).

Paper AAI7706369. http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations/AAI7706369 and ran until 1985 (with new episodes being produced sporadically during that time frame). The show, based on Cosby's remembrances of his childhood gang, focused on Fat Albert (known for his catchphrase \\"Hey hey hey!\\"), and his friends.CD liner notes: Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records The show features an educational lesson in each episode, emphasized by Cosby's live- action segments. In addition, at the end of the early episodes, the gang typically joins in their North Philadelphia junkyard to play a song on their cobbled-together instruments, summarizing the show's lesson. Origins and history The character Fat Albert first appeared in Bill Cosby's stand-up comedy routine \\"Buck Buck,\\" as recorded on his 1967 album Revenge.Cosby's character in the TV series _I Spy_, Scottie, when asked his name responded \\"Fat Albert!\\" while being interrogated. [\\"The Trouble with Temple\\", Season 2, 1967] The stories were based upon Cosby's tales about growing up in inner city North Philadelphia.Military.com. Transition Profiles -- Bill Cosby. Accessed 20 November 2008. In 1969, Cosby and veteran animator Ken Mundie brought Fat Albert to animation in a prime-time special entitled Hey, Hey, Hey, It's Fat Albert. The special, which aired on NBC, was a hybrid of live action and animation. The music for the special was written and performed by jazz pianist/keyboardist Herbie Hancock in 1969, and was released on the Warner Bros. album Fat Albert Rotunda. For the animated portion of the special, it was necessary to develop the actual appearance of each of the Fat Albert Gang's characters. For this, Ken Mundie relied on animator Amby Paliwoda, a former Disney artist. Paliwoda not only created all the Gang's characters, but painted a \\"group portrait\\" which was eventually shown on the front page of TV Guide magazine shortly before the showing of the special. The producers wanted NBC to bring Fat Albert to Saturday mornings, but the network programming managers rejected because the series was too educational. Bill Cosby and a new production company, Filmation Associates, then took the property to CBS. The Fat Albert gang's character images were primarily created by the artist Randy Hollar with the assistance of one-time Disney animator Michelle McKinney, under the direction of Ken Brown. Retitled Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, the series premiered on September 9, 1972, on CBS. Production lasted for 12 years, though production of the series was not continuous. It also spent another season in first-run syndication (1984‚Äì85). Three prime-time holiday specials (Halloween, Christmas, and Easter) featuring the characters were also produced. Like most Saturday morning cartoons of the era, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids contained an adult laugh track, which was eliminated during the final season. The series was rerun on NBC Saturday mornings and on the USA Network in 1989. On January 15, 2013, Bill Cosby posted the following on his Facebook page: \\"I'm telling you there are people at work who, I think, will make Fat Albert happen again. And it will be loved by all generations to come\\", hinting that the series might be brought back once again. No further word has been given yet, and given Cosby's known reputation now, it is likely nothing ever will.Bill Cosby's Facebook page Characters =The Cosby Kids= * Fat Albert Robertson (voiced by Bill Cosby; singing by Michael Gray) is based on Cosby's childhood friend Albert Robertson. The main character in the series, he is usually the conscience of the Junkyard Gang. Though very obese, he is athletic and enjoys playing sports. He always wears a red shirt and blue pants. Civic-minded and wise beyond his years, Fat Albert works hard to maintain integrity in the gang and with others, and is the lead singer as well as bagpipe-accordion (made from a funnel, radiator and an airbag) player in the Junkyard Band and on occasion, plays the bedspring. * James \\"Mushmouth\\" Mush (voiced by Bill Cosby) is a slack-jawed simpleton with big lips. He always wears a red knit hat with a blue scarf and always speaks in virtual Ubbi Dubbi, tantamount to an overdose of novocaine in the mouth, which Cosby would later use in the \\"Dentist\\" monologue from his 1983 film, Himself. He plays a homemade bass guitar in the Junkyard Band. * \\"Dumb\\" Donald Parker (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is a lanky, dimwitted fellow. He is Rudy's best friend. He always wears a green long-sleeved jersey three sizes too big, and a pink stocking knit cap covering his entire face except his eyes and mouth. In the Junkyard Band, he plays a trombone made out of plumbers' pipe and a morning glory horn from an old phonograph. In the Fat Albert film and while in the real world, Donald takes off his cap and learns that he has a handsome face. * William \\"Bill\\" Cosby (voiced by Bill Cosby) is a character based on Cosby himself and is the host of the series. Like the others, Bill is a good athlete and enjoys playing sports. However, he spends most of his time trying, often unsuccessfully, to keep his little brother Russell out of trouble. Like Fat Albert, Bill is often a voice of reason in the gang, although at times a little more stubborn. In the Junkyard Band, he plays homemade drums made from a discarded foot-pedal trash can using spoons for sticks. * Russell Cosby (voiced by Jan Crawford) is Bill's younger brother (based on his real-life brother‚Äîwhom he often talked about in his routines) and the smallest and youngest of the Junkyard Gang. He always wears a heavy blue jacket, a yellow scarf, red boots, and a dark blue Ushanka winter hat regardless of the weather. Russell has a penchant for making snide remarks and blunt observations (much to his older brother's consternation). Russell frequently criticizes Rudy, reserving his most withering insults for when Rudy is being especially cocky. His catchphrase is \\"no class.\\" He plays the xylophone in the Junkyard Band (made out of empty cans and a discarded coat rack). * Weird Harold Simmons (voiced by Gerald Edwards) is a tall, skinny, beady-eyed kid who is the tallest one of the Junkyard Gang and always wears a gold dress blazer, a brown sock on one foot and a red sock on the other, and is clumsy. In the Junkyard Band, he plays a harp made from bedsprings, and on occasion plays a \\"dressmaker dummy\\" in the percussion section. In the film adaptation, he is called \\"Old Weird Harold\\", as he was in Cosby's stand-up routines. * Rudy Davis (voiced by Eric Suter) is a sharp-dressed, smooth talking, cocky huckster whose smart-aleck attitude frequently gets him into trouble. He is Dumb Donald's best friend. Rudy's cocky attitude and dismissive demeanor are often the catalyst for a typical plot's conflict. But inside he has a good heart and usually learns lessons from his mistakes. In the Junkyard Band, he plays a makeshift banjo, whose parts include a broomstick handle and sewing- thread spool to hold the strings. However, when shown playing apart from the others, Rudy plays an electric guitar (personalized with a big \\"R\\"). He always wears an orange flat cap, a fuchsia vest, a pink turtleneck, purple bell- bottom jeans, and boots. Rudy's personality in the Fat Albert movie is much different as he is portrayed as a kind and chivalrous gentleman who falls in love with the female lead Doris (Kyla Pratt). * Bucky Miller (voiced by Jan Crawford), as his name indicates, has a large overbite. He is a quick and flexible athlete. Bucky plays a stovepipe organ in the Junkyard Band. =Others= * Miss Berry is the kids' first teacher and mentor. She is later replaced by Mrs. Breyfogle. In later seasons, the kids went to a different school where their teacher and mentor was Miss Wucher. All three characters were voiced by Jay Scheimer, wife of executive producer Lou Scheimer. * Mudfoot Brown (voiced by Bill Cosby) is a wise old man and unemployed vagrant who gives advice to the gang, often using reverse psychology to get his point across. He has a talent for telling tall tales (he makes a minor appearance in the film adaptation, at the beginning and end of the film, voiced by Earl Billings‚Äîhowever, he is never referred to by name in the film). * The Brown Hornet (voiced by Bill Cosby) is the title character of a show about an African-American superhero whose cartoons were watched regularly by the gang. He is a parody of the Green Hornet. ** Stinger (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is the Brown Hornet's beefy sidekick whose gruff exterior masks a soft heart. ** Tweeterbell (voiced by Erika Scheimer) is a female robot assistant to the Brown Hornet and Stinger. * Cluck ‚Äì A duck that followed the gang regularly in early episodes, but stopped appearing after season 1. (3 episodes) * Legal Eagle (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is another show-within-a-show, involving a crime-fighting cartoon eagle. ** Moe and Gabby (voiced by Jan Crawford & Gerald Edwards) Two lazy, klutzy squirrel underlings that work with Legal Eagle as police officers. * Margene (voiced by Erika Scheimer) classmate/ good friend of Fat Albert's. In one episode she and Albert ran for co-president of the Student Council and beat out two other candidates, both of whom were running on platforms of racism. A straight-A student, Margene occasionally got in with the wrong people but always managed to rebound; in a different episode she got hooked on drugs, and in another she got innocently involved in a violent cult. * 3 River Blockbusters ‚Äì The Junkyard Gang's main rival when it comes to competing in sports such as baseball and football. The Blockbusters stole the championship in a competition called \\"buck buck\\" in the episode \\"Moving\\". One of them was voiced by Gerald Edwards, who voiced Weird Harold, and one of them was voiced by Eric Suter, who voiced Rudy. They make an appearance in the film adaptation featuring totally different members and the leader, dubbed as Crips, voiced by Catero Colbert credited as Lead Teen. * Pee Wee is a small boy who looks up to Fat Albert and the gang. While being small in stature, his best athletic skill is kicking a football at a long distance. When the bigger kids could not get anything out of a small van, Pee Wee is there to retrieve it. Lou Scheimer, Erika Scheimer, Keith Allen, Lane Vaux, Pepe Brown, Dementra McHenry, Eric Suter, and Gerald Edwards provided additional voices. Episodes Educational lessons and songs Fat Albert was honored and noted for its educational content, which included Cosby earning a Doctorate in Education. In every show's opening Cosby would playfully warn: During each episode, Fat Albert and his friends (aka The Junkyard Gang), dealt with an issue or problem commonly faced by children, ranging from stage fright, first loves, medical operations, and personal hygiene to more serious themes (though toned down for younger children) including vandalism, stealing, racism, rape, smoking, being scammed by con artists, sexually transmitted diseases, child abuse, kidnapping, drug use, gun violence and death. At the end of most episodes (with some exceptions in the case of particularly serious themes), the gang would sing a song about the theme of the day. This sequence, similar to those seen in other Filmation shows including The Archie Show, has often been parodied. The musical sequence was dropped during the Brown Hornet/Legal Eagle years. The series would enjoy one of the longest runs in the history of the Saturday morning cartoons. Revamps and renames In 1979, the show was re-titled The New Fat Albert Show and featured a new segment titled \\"The Brown Hornet\\" detailing the adventures of a black crime fighter in outer space whose design resembled a caricature of Bill Cosby, who also performed vocal talents on the character. In 1984, the show was syndicated and renamed The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. The lack of network restrictions allowed the producer to delve into more mature subject matter. A notable episode (\\"Busted\\") featured the kids having an inadvertent brush with the law and given a Scared Straight!-style tour of an occupied maximum security prison; it even contained utterances (by the jail's inmates) of the words \\"damn\\" and \\"bastard\\" (Cosby had appeared in the beginning of the episode advising viewers that those words would be used as part of the story's dialogue to realistically depict jail life). Another notable episode, \\"Gang Wars\\", featured a child being shot and killed. Another segment was added: \\"Legal Eagle\\", a crime-fighting eagle with a pair of bumbling police deputy squirrels. Production of new episodes ceased in 1985. Theme song The theme song, \\"Gonna Have a Good Time\\", was composed by Ricky Sheldon and Edward Fournier, and performed by Michael Gray (vocals), Kim Carnes (background vocals) and Edward Fournier (background vocals). A cover of the show's theme song, performed by Dig, is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. The song's chorus (\\"Na-na-na, gonna have a good time!\\") was also sampled for Fatboy Slim's 1998 hit single \\"Praise You\\". Reception Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids was named the 82nd best animated series by IGN. Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids received an Emmy nomination in 1974. Production of the final season of the series overlapped with the start of production of Bill Cosby's live-action sitcom, The Cosby Show, which began airing on NBC in fall 1984. In 1993, TV Guide magazine named Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids is the best cartoon series of the 1970s in its issue celebrating 40 years of television. In 2002, Fat Albert was placed at number 12 on TV Guide's list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time. Availability =Syndication= As of 2013, Fat Albert was seen Saturday mornings on Retro Television Network (RTV), TheCoolTV, and weekdays and weekends on Bounce TV, both of which are digital networks. It was also be seen weekdays on the now- defunct Sky Angel services Angel Two and Kids & Teens TV, as well as World Harvest Television. Fat Albert was also available streaming online from HallmarkSpiritClips.com. As of July 2015, Fat Albert was no longer on Bounce TV's lineup. Bounce TV had previously pulled the comedy series Cosby from their lineup in the wake of the Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations, but it is unclear if the cancellation of the Fat Albert episodes was related to these allegations. However, several months after returning reruns of The Cosby Show in December 2016, Bounce TV quietly re-added Fat Albert to its schedule in March 2017, until it was eventually removed from the schedule again in late April 2018. =Home video= During the mid-1980s, Thorn EMI Video released several volumes of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids on VHS as part of their \\"Children's Matinee\\" line of animated programs, with each cassette typically containing three episodes. Additional volumes were released later in the decade by Video Treasures, including the three holiday specials. In 2004, UrbanWorks Entertainment acquired the rights to the series, subsequently releasing several Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids DVDs including a two-volume collection featuring 24 episodes, as well as all specials to coincide with the theatrical release of the feature film adaptation. Volume 1 contains two DVDs with episodes 1‚Äì12 (airdates 9/9‚Äì11/25/1972), along with a CD containing the opening theme, the closing theme, and 12 songs from each of the 12 episodes shown in vol. 1 Volume 2 contains two discs with episodes 13‚Äì24 (airdates 12/2/1972‚Äì9/13/1975), along with a CD containing the opening theme, the closing theme, and 12 songs from each of the 12 episodes shown in vol. 2. In addition, UrbanWorks Entertainment released a Greatest Hits four-disc DVD box set, containing 20 uncut episodes in their original broadcast presentation and original airdate order, as well as a five-best episodes set via Ventura Distribution. In 2008, Classic Media acquired the rights to the series and stated at the time that they intended to release the entire series on DVD. Unfortunately, this never happened as they only re-released The Fat Albert Halloween Special and The Fat Albert Easter Special on DVD via distribution partner Genius Products. On April 6, 2012, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series (under license from Classic Media) and planned to release a complete series box set on DVD. The DVD set was released on June 25, 2013. On September 4, 2012, Classic Media re-released all three holiday specials together in one collection entitled The Hey Hey Hey Holiday Collection on DVD in Region 1. Other media Gold Key Comics did a comic book adaptation of Fat Albert, which ran for 29 issues, from 1974 to 1979.https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fat-albert/4050-29840/ Film adaptation In 2004, 20th Century Fox released a film adaptation of the series titled Fat Albert. The film stars Kenan Thompson as Fat Albert, Kyla Pratt, and Bill Cosby. The film acts as a sequel to the series where Fat Albert and the boys journey into the real world after jumping out of a television in order to help a lonely girl named Doris (Kyla Pratt) with her social anxiety. The boys enjoy being in the real world but after a meeting with their creator, Bill Cosby, Fat Albert is informed that if he and the others do not return to the television world immediately, they will turn into celluloid dust.

As of 2008, one creation is extinct and two of the creations are extant. The extant titles have been merged since 1755. The Bacon Baronetcy, of Redgrave in the County of Suffolk, is the premier baronetcy in the Baronetage of England, which was created on 22 May 1611 for Nicholas Bacon, Member of Parliament for Beverley and Suffolk, and the eldest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, a prominent Elizabethan politician. The philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon was his half-brother. Bacon was the first person to be created a baronet. As the baronetcy is the oldest extant English baronetcy, the holder is considered the Premier Baronet of England. Bacon's second son Butts Bacon was created a baronet, of Mildenhall, in his own right in 1627 (see below). Bacon was succeeded by his eldest son, Edmund, the second Baronet. He represented Eye and Norfolk in the House of Commons. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Robert, the third Baronet. On his death, the title passed to his grandson, Edmund, the fourth Baronet. He served as High Sheriff of Suffolk from 1665 to 1666. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his first cousin, Robert, the fifth Baronet. He was the son of Butts Bacon, younger son of the fourth Baronet. When he died, the title passed to his son, Edmund, the sixth Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Thetford and Norfolk. He had no sons and on his death in 1755, the line of the second Baronet failed. The late Baronet was succeeded by his third cousin once removed, Sir Richard Bacon, 8th Baronet, of Mildenhall, great-great-grandson of the aforementioned Sir Butts Bacon, 1st Baronet, of Mildenhall, second son of the first Baronet of Redgrave. He died without surviving issue and was succeeded by his nephew, Edmund, the eighth/ninth Baronet. He was the son of the fourth Baronet of Mildenhall by his second wife Mary Castell. His elder son, Edmund, the ninth/tenth Baronet, died without surviving male issue in 1864. He was succeeded by his nephew, Henry, the tenth/eleventh Baronet. He was the son of Nicholas Bacon, younger son of the eighth/ninth Baronet. Bacon was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1867. His elder son, Hickman, the eleventh/twelfth Baronet, was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1887 and a justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant of the county. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, Nicholas, the twelfth/thirteenth Baronet. He was High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1895, a justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county and Chairman of the Lindsey County Council. He was succeeded by his only son, Edmund, the thirteenth/fourteenth Baronet. He was a soldier, businessman, public servant and Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk. In 1970 he was made a Knight of the Garter. As of 2014 the titles are held by his only son, the fourteenth/fifteenth Baronet, who succeeded in 1982. The Bacon Baronetcy, of Mildenhall in the County of Suffolk, was created in the Baronetage of England on 29 July 1627 for Butts Bacon, second son of the first Baronet of the 1611 creation. His great-grandson (the title having descended from father to son), Edmund, the fourth Baronet, represented Orford in Parliament. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Edmund, the fifth Baronet. He was Member of Parliament for Thetford. His only son, Edmund, the sixth Baronet, died unmarried at an early age in 1750. He was succeeded by his uncle, Henry, the seventh Baronet. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the eighth Baronet. In 1755 he succeeded his third cousin once removed as eighth Baronet of Redgrave. For further history of the titles, see above. The Bacon Baronetcy, of Gillingham in the County of Norfolk, was created in the Baronetage of England on 7 February 1662 for Nicholas Bacon. He was the son of Nicholas Bacon, fourth son of the first Baronet of the 1611 creation and brother of the first Baronet of the 1627 creation. His two sons, the second and third Baronets, both succeeded in the title. They both died young and the title became extinct on the latter's death in 1685. Redgrave Manor, the former family seat in Suffolk, was bought by the elder Sir Nicholas Bacon from Henry VIII in 1542 and substantially restored between 1545 and 1554. It was the seat of the Bacon family until debts forced the fifth Baronet, Sir Robert Bacon, to sell the estate in 1702 to Sir John Holt.

He worked as a civil servant for various international organizations, such as the International Labour Organization. He became a Swiss citizen in 1919.\\"Cohen, Albert from Jewish Writers of the Twentieth Century\\", Further references, related titles, by David Coward. Bookrags 18 June 2010, 11:58 Biography Abraham Albert Cohen () was born in Corfu, Greece, in 1895, to Greek Jewish parents. Albert's parents, who owned a soap factory, moved to Marseille, France, when he was a child. Albert Cohen discusses this period in his novel Le Livre de ma m√®re (The Book of my Mother). He studied at a private Catholic school. In 1904, he started high school at Lyc√©e Thiers, where he met and started a lifelong friendship with Marcel Pagnol, and graduated in 1913. In 1914, he left Marseille for Geneva, Switzerland, and enrolled in Law school. He graduated from Law School in 1917 and enrolled in Literature School in 1917, where he remained until 1919. In 1919, he became a Swiss citizen. That same year he married Elisabeth Brocher, who in 1921 gave birth to their daughter, Myriam. In 1924, his wife died of cancer. In 1925, Albert Cohen became director of Revue Juive (The Jewish Review), a periodical whose writers included Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. From 1926 to 1931, he served as a civil servant in Geneva. In 1933, he married his second wife, Marianne Goss. During the German occupation, in 1940, Cohen fled to Bordeaux, then to London. The Jewish Agency for Palestine then made him responsible for establishing contacts with exiled governments. On January 10, 1943, Cohen's mother died in Marseille. That same year, he met his future third wife, Bella Berkowich. In 1944, he became an attorney for the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees. In 1947, Cohen returned to Geneva. In 1957, he turned down the post of Israeli Ambassador in order to pursue his literary career. He died in Geneva at the age of 86 and is buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Veyrier, near Geneva. Cohen's literature Through four different books, Cohen's fiction can be considered as one long autobiographical fiction. It is the story of the radiant Solal ‚Äì Cohen's double ‚Äì a handsome and successful civil servant of the League of Nations whose charismatic identity is a constant struggle between his Jewish roots and his social status. His masterpiece, Belle du Seigneur, originally included the novel that was later published as Les Valeureux. Belle du Seigneur is called \\"the book of love\\", and tells Solal's passionate, cruel yet realistic love affair with Ariane Deume ‚Äì a married non- Jewish woman.

He was a member of the Terra Nova expedition and is acclaimed for his 1922 account of this expedition, The Worst Journey in the World.  Early life  Born in Bedford, as Apsley George Benet Cherry, the eldest child of Apsley Cherry of Denford Park and his wife, Evelyn Edith (n√©e Sharpin), daughter of Henry Wilson Sharpin of Bedford. He was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford where he read classics and modern history. While at Oxford, he rowed in the 1908 Christ Church crew which won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The Cherry-Garrard family with Apsley on the right His surname was changed to Cherry-Garrard by the terms of his great-aunt's will, through which his father inherited the Lamer Park estate near Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire. Apsley inherited the estate on his father's death in 1907. Cherry-Garrard had always been enamoured by the stories of his father's achievements in India and China where he had fought with merit for the British Army, and felt that he must live up to his father's example. In September 1907, Edward Adrian Wilson met with Robert Falcon Scott at Reginald Smith's home in Cortachy, to discuss another Antarctic expedition; Smith's young cousin Apsley Cherry-Garrard happened to visit and decided to volunteer.  Antarctica  At the age of 24, 'Cherry' was one of the youngest members of the Terra Nova expedition. This was Scott's second and last expedition to Antarctica. Cherry's application to join the expedition was initially rejected as Scott was looking for scientists, but he made a second application along with a promise of towards the cost of the expedition. Rejected a second time, he made the donation regardless. Struck by this gesture, and at the same time persuaded by Edward Adrian Wilson, Scott agreed to take Cherry-Garrard as assistant zoologist. The expedition arrived in the Antarctic on 4 January 1911. During the remainder of the southern summer, from January to March, Cherry-Garrard helped lay depots of fuel and food on the intended route of the party which would attempt to reach the South Pole. = Winter journey = Cherry-Garrard the hut at Cape Evans, 30 August 1911 With Wilson and Henry Robertson Bowers, Cherry-Garrard made a trip to Cape Crozier on Ross Island in July 1911 during the austral winter in order to secure an unhatched emperor penguin egg to hopefully help scientists prove the evolutionary link between all birds and their reptile predecessors by analysis of the embryo. Cherry-Garrard suffered from a high degree of myopia, seeing little without the spectacles that he could not wear while sledging. In almost total darkness, and with temperatures ranging from , they man-hauled their sledge from Scott's base at Cape Evans to the far side of Ross Island. The party had two sledges, but the poor surface of the ice due to the extremely low temperatures meant that they could not drag both sledges as intended during parts of the outward journey. They were thus forced to relay, moving one sledge a certain distance before returning for the other. This highly inefficient means of travelling‚Äîwalking for every one advanced‚Äîmeant at times they could only travel a couple of miles each day. Frozen and exhausted, they reached their destination in 19 days and built an improvised rock wall igloo with canvas roof on the slopes of Mount Terror just a few miles from the penguin colony at Cape Crozier. They managed to collect three penguin eggs intact before a force eleven blizzard struck on 22 July, ripping their tent away and carrying it off in the wind. The igloo roof lasted one more day before it too was ripped away by the wind, leaving the men in their sleeping bags under a thickening drift of snow, singing songs and hymns above the sounds of the storm to keep their spirits up. When the winds subsided on 24 July, by great fortune they found their tent lodged in a hollow drift at the bottom of a steep slope half a mile away. Cherry-Garrard suffered such cold that he shattered most of his teeth due to chattering in the frigid temperatures. Desperately exhausted by the cold and lack of sleep, they left anything they didn't need behind and began their return journey. Only progressing a mile and a half some days, they eventually arrived back at Cape Evans shortly before midnight on 1 August. Cherry-Garrard later referred to this as the 'worst journey in the world' at the suggestion of his neighbour George Bernard Shaw, and gave this title to his book recounting the fate of the 1910‚Äì1913 expedition. = Polar journey = On 1 November 1911, Cherry- Garrard set off to accompany the team that would make the attempt on the South Pole, along with three supporting parties of men, dogs and horses. At the foot of the Beardmore Glacier, the horses were shot and their flesh cached for food, while the dog teams turned back for base. At the top of the Beardmore Glacier, on 22 December, Cherry-Garrard was in the second supporting party to be sent home, arriving back at base on 26 January 1912. = One Ton Depot = Bowers, Wilson and Cherry-Garrard Scott had left orders for dog-driver Meares and surgeon Edward L. Atkinson to take the dog teams south in early February 1912 to meet Scott's party on 1 March at latitude 82¬∞ or 82¬∞30‚Ä≤S, and to assist his return journey. As Cecil Meares was not available for work, Atkinson had to attend to a medical emergency, and George Simpson was busy, the fateful choice fell on Cherry-Garrard. Belatedly, on 26 February 1912, Cherry-Garrard and dog handler Dimitri Gerov set off southwards and soon reached One Ton Depot on 3 March, and deposited additional food. They waited there seven days hoping to meet the South Pole team. Cherry-Garrard and Dimitri then turned back on 10 March. Scott's party was at that time only , i.e. three dog marches south of One Ton Depot. Scott and his companions eventually reached a point south of One Ton Depot, where they starved to death. Cherry-Garrard later wrote that \\"the primary object of this journey with the dog team[s] was to hurry Scott and his companions home\\" but they \\"were never meant to be a relief journey\\". He justified his decision to wait for a week and then turn back, stating that the poor weather, with daytime temperatures as low as , made further southward travel impossible, and the lack of dog food meant he would have had to kill dogs for food, against Atkinson's orders. They returned to base on 16 March empty-handed, immediately causing anxiety about Scott's fate. Two days later, Cherry-Garrard fainted and became an invalid for the following days. Atkinson set forth to fetch Scott, but on 30 March was forced to turn back in the face of low temperatures, and concluded that Scott's party had perished. = Search journey = Cherry- Garrard was eventually appointed record keeper and continued zoological work. The scientific work continued through the winter and it was not until October 1912 that a team led by Atkinson and including Cherry-Garrard was able to head south to ascertain the fate of the South Pole team. On 12 November, the bodies of Scott, Wilson and Bowers were found in their tent, along with their diaries and records, and geological specimens they had hauled back from the mountains of the interior. Cherry-Garrard was deeply affected, particularly by the deaths of Wilson and Bowers, with whom he had made the journey to Cape Crozier.  Later life  Cherry-Garrard's grave at St Helen's Church, Wheathampstead Not long after his return to civilization in February 1913, Cherry-Garrard accompanied Edward Atkinson on his journey to China to assist Atkinson with his investigation on a type of parasitic flatworm that was causing schistosomiasis among British seamen. At the start of the Great War, Cherry-Garrard, along with the help of his mother and sisters, converted Lamer, his family estate, into a field hospital for wounded soldiers returning from the front. Cherry-Garrard journeyed to Belgium in August 1914 with Major Edwin Richardson, a dog trainer who used dogs to sniff out wounded soldiers and founded the British War Dog School, to assist on the front with a pack of bloodhounds. Cherry-Garrard volunteered for this opportunity, in part due to his experience with handling dogs in Antarctica. After this opportunity was cut short, Cherry-Garrard returned to England and was eventually commissioned in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and commanded a squadron of armoured cars in Flanders. Invalided out in 1916, he suffered from clinical depression as well as ulcerative colitis which had developed shortly after returning from Antarctica. His lifespan preceded the description and diagnosis of what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. Although his psychological condition was never cured, the explorer was able to treat himself to some extent by writing down his experiences, although he spent many years bed-ridden due to his afflictions. He required repeated dental treatment because of the damage done to his teeth by the extreme cold. He many times revisited the question of what possible alternative choices and actions might have saved the South Pole team ‚Äî most notably in his 1922 book The Worst Journey in the World. On 6 September 1939, Cherry-Garrard married Angela Katherine Turner (1916‚Äì2005), whom he had met during a Norwegian cruise in 1937. They had no children. After the Second World War, ill health and taxes forced him to sell his family estate and move to a flat in London, where he died in Piccadilly on 18 May 1959. He is buried in the north-west corner of the churchyard of St Helen's Church, Wheathampstead.  Writings  The three emperor penguin eggs collected at Cape Crozier In 1922, encouraged by his friend George Bernard Shaw, Cherry-Garrard wrote The Worst Journey in the World. Over 80 years later this book is still in print and is often cited as a classic of travel literature, having been acclaimed as the greatest true adventure story ever written. It was published as Penguin Books' 100th publication. More recently however, Roland Huntford has dismissed the Worst Journey as \\"an immature but persuasive, highly charged apologia\\". Cherry-Garrard contributed an essay in remembrance of T. E. Lawrence in the first edition of a volume edited by Lawrence's brother, A. W. Lawrence, T. E. Lawrence, by His Friends. Subsequent abridged editions omit his article. Cherry-Garrard hypothesises in this essay that Lawrence undertook extraordinary acts out of a sense of inferiority and cowardice and a need to prove himself. He suggests, too, that Lawrence's writings‚Äîas well as Cherry's own‚Äîwere therapeutic and helped in dealing with the nervous breakdown of the events they recount.  Legacy  The igloo on Cape Crozier was discovered by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1957‚Äì1958. Only of the stone walls remained standing. Relics were removed and placed in museums in New Zealand. The three penguin eggs brought back from Cape Crozier are now in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London.

It involves weighting down the victim, who may be dead or alive, with concrete and throwing them into water in the hope the body will never be found. In the US, the term has become tongue-in- cheek for a threat of death by criminals. While a common trope in fiction, only one real-life case has ever been authenticated. Cement shoes involve first binding, incapacitating or killing the victim and then placing each foot into a bucket or box, which is then filled with wet concrete (a mixture of cement powder, water and sand), or even simply cement powder and water. Typically in movies and novels the victim is still alive as they watch the concrete harden, heightening the torture and drama. After the concrete sets, the victim is thrown into a body of water such as a river, lake or the ocean.  Real-life incidents  Despite being a theme in Hollywood movies like Lady in Cement and books like E. L. Doctorow's Billy Bathgate, whether such a cumbersome and time-consuming method of execution was practical remained in question. Cement takes many hours or even days to fully harden and, until 2016, there was never a documented case‚Äîalthough crime historian Thomas Reppetto said there have probably been real-life examples that have never been found. In May 2016, the first and only documented case of \\"cement shoes\\" was reported. The body of Brooklyn gang member Peter Martinez, aged 28, better known on the streets as Petey Crack, washed up near Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn. His head was wrapped in duct tape, the immediate cause of his death. His feet and shins were encased in concrete set inside a five-gallon bucket. His body floated to the shore due to air in the concrete because it was not given enough time to dry before being thrown into the ocean. Concrete has been used as a weight to dispose of a body. In 1941, the body of Philadelphia racketeer Johnnie Goodman was found by crab fisherman in a New Jersey creek, weighed down with an block of concrete. On August 24, 1964, the body of Ernest Rupolo, aged 52, a trigger man who informed on Vito Genovese in 1944, was found in Jamaica Bay, New York, with concrete blocks tied to his legs. It is also speculated that bootlegger Rocco Perri was murdered by being fitted with cement shoes and thrown into Hamilton Harbour in 1944.

The programme ran for three series, and included two Christmas specials and a feature film of the same name (in the United States, the film was released under the title Doing Time). The sitcom focuses on two prison inmates, Norman Stanley Fletcher (played by Barker) and Lennie Godber (played by Beckinsale), who are serving time at the fictional HMP Slade in Cumberland. Several characters from Porridge reappear in the sequel series Going Straight (1978) and in the 2003 spoof documentary Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher. The 2016 sequel series of Porridge has different cast of characters, although Nigel Norman Fletcher in the 2016 series is the grandson of Norman Stanley Fletcher in the original series. Mr Barrowclough Henry Barrowclough is a prison officer, portrayed by Brian Wilde. Unlike Mr Mackay, whose harsh and confrontational methods he disapproves of (though he dare not make this known to Mr Mackay), Barrowclough is a timid, sympathetic man who firmly believes that the role of prison is to rehabilitate rather than punish. He does not share Mackay's tough military background, having done his National Service in Royal Air Force stores in the comfortable surroundings of Singapore. Mr Barrowclough does not seem to be cut out for the life of a prison warder, and he says in the movie version whilst in conversation with a new officer that Slade prison is a miserable place and that the only reason he stays is that it's either this or being at home with the wife. Fletcher and the other prisoners constantly abuse his leniency to acquire more pleasant jobs, cells or special privileges. They also know how to forge his signature. However, despite this, the prisoners do hold a great deal of fondness for Barrowclough. At one point, in an attempt to raise his prestige due to the vicious nature of Mr. Wainwright, the (temporary) replacement of Mackay, they stage a riot, refusing to stop for even the harshest of threats, including Wainwright himself. But when, on Fletch's suggestion, Barrowclough is called into the hall, they fall silent as he nervously enters, and do not hesitate in obeying his rather timid requests, such as 'now, why don't you all put those things down...' and 'in the meantime, why don't we all file back to our cells in a nice, orderly fashion...?' However nervous his job makes Mr Barrowclough, it is nothing compared to the fear he has of his oft-mentioned but never seen wife, Alice. It is partly because of Fletcher's advice on dealing with his wife that Barrowclough is especially lenient when dealing with his requests and misdemeanours. Fletcher once described him as looking like 'Arthur Askey on stilts'. Ingrid Fletcher Ingrid Rita Godber (n√©e Fletcher) was played by Patricia Brake. Ingrid is Fletch's eldest child (allegedly conceived against Karl Marx's tomb). She often visited her father in Slade Prison, oblivious to her appeal to the other inmates, much to her father's despair. It was on one of these trips that she met Fletch's cell-mate Godber. Upon Godber's release the two met up, and by the time Fletch was released, three years later, the two were engaged. They were married in the final episode of Going Straight and are seen to be still married 25 years later in the spoof documentary, Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher, with one son. Norman Stanley Fletcher Norman Stanley Fletcher was played by Ronnie Barker. Known as 'Fletch', he is the main character in the series and shares a cell with Lennie Godber. A habitual criminal from north London, Fletch has previously served several terms of imprisonment. Lennie Godber Richard Beckinsale as Godber in Porridge Leonard Arthur \\"Lennie\\" Godber was played by Richard Beckinsale. Godber is from Birmingham, supports Aston Villa, has an O Level in geography, and studies for a history O Level while in prison. Before he was arrested he shared a flat with his girlfriend Denise in nearby Smethwick. In an effort to get her a gift, Godber broke into a neighbour's flat. He was caught, and it was for this that he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Denise later broke up with Godber through a Dear John letter. Godber often came into conflict with the ever suspicious Mr Mackay, who appeared to find it very hard to believe that Lennie was not up to something. Even when he was, MacKay found it very hard to pin anything on him, thanks to Godber's penchant for dramatics, and occasionally to the cover-up efforts of Fletch and the sympathetic Mr. Barrowclough. Godber works in the prison kitchen where he has ample opportunities to steal valuable commodities such as butter and pineapple chunks that Fletcher is fond of. Godber also briefly took up a career as a boxer in the prison, although this was short-lived when he became involved in match fixing. Godber appears in all but four episodes of Porridge. He is absent from the pilot (Prisoner and Escort) series 1 episodes Ways and Means and Men Without Women, and series 2's No Peace for the Wicked In the sequel Going Straight, Godber is engaged to Fletcher's daughter Ingrid, having met her whilst she was on a prison visit. In the 2003 mockumentary Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher, they are still married, and have a son. Harry Grout Harry Grout as portrayed by Peter Vaughan \\"Genial\\" Harry Grout, also referred to as 'Grouty', is feared by all prisoners. His schemes include running a drugs ring funded by the doctor's office and fixing boxing matches. If crossed, Grouty has little hesitation in setting one of his various heavies on those who displease him. Grouty also arranges things such as prison breaks, as seen in the Christmas special \\"No Way Out,\\" in which the major plot involves his trying to arrange a breakout plan, with much help from an unwilling Fletcher. Eventually, Fletcher reveals the tunnel that was dug to Mr. Mackay but ends up landing himself in the prison infirmary. After Mackay offers him a bottle of whisky in exchange for information, Fletcher tells him that they disposed of the soil from the tunnel by burying it in a second one. In the 2003 mockumentary Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher, it is revealed that after being released from prison Grouty continued running his \\"business empire\\" (although he insisted it was now straight, and no-one could prove otherwise), and also became a \\"celebrity criminal\\", in a similar manner to Frankie Fraser and The Krays. He died of a heart attack, but just before he died, he told Fletcher where his stash was hidden. Fletcher is seen laying a memorial wreath at his funeral which simply says \\"Nerk\\". Cyril Heslop Cyril Heslop was played by Brian Glover. Heslop is prominent in Season 1 of the show and was briefly Fletcher's cellmate. He was also one of the three new arrivals, along with Fletcher and Godber, into Slade Prison in the first episode of the series, having been given three years for breaking and entering. Heslop is quite dim and slow-witted, once being described by Mr. Mackay as \\"thick as two short planks.\\" This is also demonstrated in the fact that he is always several minutes behind every conversation, such as laughing at jokes made some time earlier or making remarks to or asking questions about a subject that was talked about many minutes ago, when the conversation has moved on. Heslop is also known among the prison inmates for his interesting anecdotes, many of which relate to events which took place \\"at the wife's sister's in Sidcup\\", which he launches into at random moments, with every inmate present ending their conversation to listen to him. It is mentioned in his first appearance his birthday was on 1 April which is considered by Fletcher to be quite fitting for him. Lukewarm Lukewarm was played by Christopher Biggins. Lukewarm is a rotund young man with a calm and personable demeanour, who originates from the Midlands (though during the series, and in Going Straight he is said to be from Middlesbrough). The circumstances that brought him to be in prison are unknown although in one episode ‚Äì the Porridge Christmas Special, \\"No Way Out\\" ‚Äì he successfully relieved Mr Barrowclough of his watch, in a manner strongly suggestive of a skilled pickpocket. He is openly gay, and his partner Trevor is a watch repairer from Southport; Trevor appears in the episode \\"Men Without Women\\". Lukewarm shared a cell with the elderly Blanco, over whom he would fuss a lot, especially when Blanco was due to face the parole board. Blanco did concede that, for all his fussing, Lukewarm did keep the cell nice and clean. Lukewarm is often seen knitting. Although he is a trusted friend and confidant of Fletcher's, he seldom becomes directly involved in his schemes, preferring instead to spend his association time observing the latest goings-on whilst busying himself with his latest knitting projects. He works in the kitchens alongside Godber and is an enthusiastic if notoriously untalented cook (although it was said that he did make good pasties). Lukewarm was released three months prior to Fletcher in Going Straight. Fletcher mentions to McLaren that he received a letter from Lukewarm, stating his case is coming up after he was accused of stealing a woman's handbag, which he claimed was his own. In the mockumentary \\"Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher\\", his real name is revealed as being Timothy Underwood, although in Just Desserts he appears to be addressed by a warder as Lewis. It is stated that he is now married to Trevor and living in Denmark. Jim McLaren Jim \\"Jock\\" McLaren is played by Tony Osoba. McLaren, who claims to have been adopted, is a black man from Greenock, Scotland. This led to a string of racist abuse when he first arrived at Slade Prison. Fletcher, in reference to his Scottish upbringing, frequently calls him \\"Jock\\". Upon arrival, he was an angry young man, and it was left up to Fletcher to calm him down and to curb the abuse he received. A keen football player, he was soon turning out every Saturday afternoon for the inter-wing football matches. He supports Greenock Morton. Along with Godber and Warren, McLaren is a regular conspirator with Fletcher. He is the last of their circle to be released, and Fletcher is seen bidding him farewell in the first episode of Going Straight. In \\"Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher\\", McLaren is a member of the Scottish Parliament. Mr Mackay Mr Mackay (born 23 April 1923) is played by Fulton Mackay. Mackay is a tough prison warder whose constant obsession in life is to catch Fletcher out. Mackay has the authority to make decisions affecting the entire wing, such as banning Christmas celebrations in the episode No Way Out, so is presumably the wing Custodial Manager. Fletch's sly tactics in misdeeds ranging from fixing boxing matches, stealing pills from the prison doctor and eggs from the prison farmyard right through to finding new and imaginative ways to stick two fingers up at Mackay and get away with it, were specially designed to get up Mackay's nose. In return, Mackay's frenzied attempts to catch Fletch out, when fruitful, gave Mackay a level of smugness and satisfaction which was only accentuated by Fletch's hostility and skulking. Born into a poor family, Mackay went on to be a drill sergeant (though in Going Straight this is changed to Warrant Officer Class 2) in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and ran a boarding house in Peebles with his wife, Marie, before joining the prison service. Mackay's temper is agitated by the constant suspicion he has of Fletcher, and his despair at the leniency of his other polar opposite in the series ‚Äì his optimistic, mild-mannered, kind-hearted colleague Mr Barrowclough. Mackay's homeland of Scotland serves as a constant source of entertainment for Fletcher, who is always on the lookout for an opportunity to antagonise Mackay. In one episode Mackay asks Fletcher whether he felt he was working class. Fletcher responds 'I did, until I visited Glasgow. Now I think I'm middle class.' Mackay appears in the first episode of Going Straight, where it is revealed he has left Slade Prison after reaching the compulsory retirement age for prison officers. =Medals= During the series Mackay regularly wore his army service ribbons on his uniform. During the run of the series he wore the General Service Medal 1918‚Äì1962, the Korea Medal, and the UN Korea Medal. For the film this was inexplicably expanded to an additional row containing the 1939‚Äì1945 Star, the Defence Medal, the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945, and lastly the Jubilee Medal, 1977, which was awarded on the 25th anniversary of Elizabeth II's rule. 100x30px 100x30px 100x30px 100x30px 100x30px 100x30px 100x30px Harris Harris is a prisoner played by Ronald Lacey. A middle-aged Teddy Boy with a fish face and ginger hair, Harris ‚Äì much like \\"Horrible\\" Ives ‚Äì is loathed by warders and prisoners alike. His sly manner, cowardice, and utter lack of integrity ‚Äì accompanied by an insistently oleaginous manner ‚Äì irritates even the easy-going Lukewarm and emollient Mr Barrowclough. Harris is a thief (an activity taboo inside prison) and a cheat, and bullies anyone whom he deems to be weaker than he is. However, he in turn is dominated by all those above him, such as Harry Grout, Mr Mackay and Fletcher. He was arrested when an attempt to mug an old lady went wrong, when it became evident that she had a brick in her handbag. The old lady succeeded in pinning Harris down until the police arrived. With the arrival of Judge Rawley at Slade, Harris is relegated to the job of mucking out and feeding the pigs. Later, he, McLaren and another inmate attack Judge Rawley, but are stopped by Fletcher. Harris is then accused of stealing Judge Rawley's watch, and Fletcher decides to hold a kangaroo court with Rawley as the judge, Fletcher as the prosecutor and Warren as the defence counsel. However, because Fletcher insisted on a proper enquiry, Rawley has no option but to clear Harris. Harris returns Rawley's watch, but with the mechanism missing. \\"Horrible\\" Ives Bernard \\"Horrible\\" Ives is a prisoner serving time in Slade for committing fraud. He was played by Ken Jones. Ives is a creep, a cheat and a snitch, universally loathed by the other inmates of Slade Prison. He originated from Liverpool. Almost all his spoken sentences begin with the words \\"'ere listen\\". Fletcher once commented \\"Ives is such a loser that if Elizabeth Taylor had triplets, he'd have been the one in the middle, on the bottle.\\" Ives is interviewed in the 2003 mockumentary Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher. While most of the ex-prisoners interviewed are shown to have gone straight, Ives is shown collecting for a fake charity. Blanco Webb Blanco Webb is played by David Jason. An elderly inmate, Blanco first appears in the episode No Peace for the Wicked where he helps Fletcher steal some Jaffa Cakes. He features heavily in the episode Happy Release where he and Fletch are in adjacent beds in the prison hospital, Fletch having broken his foot and Blanco having been diagnosed with a \\"tired heart\\". Also in the hospital is Norris (played by Colin Farrell) ‚Äì considered \\"scum\\" even by the other inmates ‚Äì who had managed to con Blanco out of his only possessions: an antique silver snuff box, a Japanese wireless, and a musical box that played Waltzing Matilda when opened. Fletch manages to reacquire Blanco's possessions with Godber's help, and manages to get Norris, newly released, re-arrested after only one day by tricking him into trying to dig for \\"treasure\\" underneath Leeds United's Elland Road pitch. Throughout his lengthy prison sentence Blanco continued to profess his innocence, and when parole was granted (in the episode Pardon Me) he refused, preferring the prospect of dying in prison to that of admitting guilt. When he is finally granted a pardon, Fletch warns him not to seek revenge on the person who really killed his wife. Blanco's response is an oft- repeated comedy moment: \\"No. I know 'im wot did it. It were the wife's lover. But don't worry, I shan't go round searching for him, 'e died years ago. That I do know. It were me that killed him!\\". This however conflicts with the episode No Peace for the Wicked where it is strongly implied that he was jailed for an armed robbery on wages van. Fletcher states that Blanco has two years left of his sentence to serve but, given there is a mandatory life sentence for murder in the UK, Blanco would be highly unlikely to know when he would be released on licence that far in advance.

She studied at the Council of Arts & Manufactures and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, with Charles Maillard and Maurice Feliz, and later with Edwin Holgate at the Art Association of Montreal. She won many notable prizes for her work, which has been exhibited in institutions in the United States, Italy, and Canada. She is known for her portrait sculptures, and for revitalizing the traditions of liturgical art. Daoust was also one of the original members of the organization Le Retable d‚ÄôArt Sacre, a group that helped transform the state of Roman Catholic churches in French Canada. Daoust died in Montreal in 2004 at the age of 102. Life and education Daoust was born on May 24, 1902 in Montreal, Quebec the eldest of seven children. From an early age she began drawing, sketching, painting and also sculpting clay figurines. The figurines caught the eye of the Sisters of St. Anne, who encouraged her to enroll at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts de Qu√©bec. In 1915, she began studying at the Conseil des arts et manufactures with Joseph Franch√®re, Joseph Saint-Charles and John Young Johnstone. In 1923, Daoust enrolled in the √âcole des beaux arts, which had just recently opened. In 1927, she graduated with a specialized teaching degree in drawing. In 1929, Daoust won the Lord Willingdon Competition,the first-place prize in an inter-provincial competition for sculpture and in the same year received a scholarship to study in France from the province of Qu√©bec She studied in France with Henri Charlier. She returned home in 1930, teaching drawing, anatomy, modeling, and sculpting at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Qu√©bec City until 1943. Daoust then moved back to Montreal to be a professor of wood and stone sculpting at the Montreal School of Fine Arts (1943‚Äì1968). After her death in 2004, she was buried in the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.  Work  Edouard Mont Petit (1967) by Sylvia Daoust Fr√®re Marie-Victorin (1951) by Sylvia Daoust The majority of Daoust's works are religious in content and form. They have been described as a combination of the formal characteristics of modernism with the austerity of sculpture of the Middle Ages. While she did extensive work in the classroom, 1948 marked the beginning her career in modernist art alongside fellow artist and peer, Paul-√âmile Borduas. During the early 1940s movement of sacred art, she became acquainted with Dom Bello, the architect of Saint Benedict Abbey in Saint-Benoit-du-Lac, Qu√©bec. She put aside her pursuit of modernist art and delved into scared art. Dom Bellot was in charge of Saint Joseph‚Äôs Oratory and she worked with his guidance there and in collaboration with Henri Charlier. Her transition into sacred art was marked by the production of approximately thirty wooden statues to which she added colour accents and experimented with different materials such as aluminum and leather. She participated in over twenty exhibits and collectives, although much of her work was not displayed in art galleries. Daoust was one of the original founding members of Le Retable d‚ÄôArt Sacre, an organization that advocated and promoted the standards of religious art within the Roman Catholic churches in Qu√©bec. She continued to sculpt into her 90s, and her last works were for the chapel of the Holy Cross Fathers in Montreal.  Collections and awards  Daoust's works are in the collection of the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec, and the National Gallery of Canada, among others. Her public sculptures include the bronze of Nicolas Viel adorning the fa√ßade of the Quebec Legislature (National Assembly), Mary Queen of the World at Montreal's Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral and a statue of √âdouard Montpetit at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. In 1942, she won the first prize for Our Lady of Montreal, in the competition held on the occasion of the Third Centenary of the Founding Nationale de St. Jean Baptiste. In 1951, she was named to the Royal Canadian Academy of Art and in 1961 she was awarded the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada‚Äôs Allied Arts Award. In 1975, Daoust won the Philippe H√©bert Prize by the St. Jean Baptiste Society. In 1976, she was made a member of the Order of Canada and honoured in 1987 as a chevalier of the Ordre national du Qu√©bec.

Development and production The series' co-creator Douglas Ross thought that summer camp would be the \\"perfect setting for a reality-based program geared for 9 to 12-year-olds.\\" Ross, a former camper himself, pitched the idea to the Disney Channel and the then head of programming and production Rich Ross. He was given the green light to create the series without a pilot episode. The location, Camp Waziyatah, was decided a few months before the 1997 camp season started. The producers conducted about 100 phone interviews and 60 home visits before selecting 27 campers. Four camp counselors were chosen from both the camp's existing group and 350 members of the public in response to an open call on the Internet. The first season was filmed for 56 days straight by three film crews. The boys' and girls' cabins had all male and all female crews, led by directors Donald Bull and Laura Zucco respectively. On July 15, 1999, Disney ordered a second season; it premiered on March 5, 2000. In June 2000, production began on a third season which was announced on July 12; it began airing on June 3, 2001.

This complex is known as a centre of research with a broad range of clinical services and medical specialties. It is a branch of the larger Centro Hospitalar e Universit√°rio de Coimbra, a rebranded merged institution created during the eruption of the European sovereign debt crisis and the Portuguese economic and financial crisis in 2012. History Col√©gio de S√£o Jer√≥nimo, today an ancient building in the oldest campus of the University of Coimbra (the monumental and touristic P√≥lo I), was the former building of the Coimbra University Hospitals until the 1980s. Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra - main entrance. In its early days, it used to function in two separated buildings which can be traced back to the 16th century. Part belonged to the College of St. Jerome begun in the 1560s. In 1836 it was handed over to the University of Coimbra, and twelve years later several hospital departments were transferred there. From then on it was known as the Hospital of St. Jerome. Several features bear witness to its history: the gateway built in the middle of the 18th century, which used to serve as the main entrance to the hospital and the great staircase built soon afterwards, remarkable not only for the elegance of its lines but also for the tiles that make up the side panel containing a variety of scenes set in a Rococo moulding. The second building is the Royal College of Arts, which belonged to the Society of Jesus and was begun in 1568. The Coimbra High School was installed in this building in 1836 but in 1853 some hospital departments were transferred here. From 1870 onwards it was entirely given over to the Hospital. In the late 1980s, these two old buildings were abandoned by the HUC services and are now patrimony of the University of Coimbra. Nowadays the main centre of HUC operates in its own building, inaugurated in 1987 in Celas area of Coimbra. There are many other buildings of this Hospital, dispersed around a large area in Coimbra, forming a huge Medical Centre. In 2012, due to the European sovereign debt crisis and the Portuguese economic and financial crisis, the government merged the Coimbra University Hospitals with the Centro Hospitalar de Coimbra (C.H.C.) in order to reduce costs, fight overcapacity and unnecessary redundancy and create economic synergies for the state run hospitals operating in Coimbra. The rebranded merged institution was then renamed C.H.U.C. - Centro Hospitalar Universit√°rio de Coimbra.

The show became the International Air Tattoo in 1976, and recognition of its unique status was granted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996, when the current Royal International Air Tattoo title was adopted. * The show took place at Fairford every two years until it became an annual show from 1993. Due to redevelopment work at RAF Fairford the show was held at RAF Cottesmore, Rutland in 2000 and 2001. * Guinness World Records have recognised RIAT 2003 as the world's largest ever military airshow, with 535 aircraft in attendance. * In 2014 224 aircraft from 32 air arms were on display.

The show is a showcase for the world's military, and has become an important precursor to the Farnborough Airshow, which takes place a week after RIAT, every 'even' year. It allows the military aerospace industry to display and present its products outside the commercial pressures of the Farnborough show. =2008 cancellation= RIAT 2008 following cancellation The 2008 airshow was to feature two themes, the 90th Anniversary of the Royal Air Force and Global Engagement and was scheduled to be held on 12‚Äì13 July.

On 11 July, the day before the air show opened to the public, Queen Elizabeth II presented, in poor weather conditions, new colours to the RAF and RAF Regiment in front of selected guests and VIPs. A week of heavy rainfall made the already-waterlogged car parks and parts of the airfield unusable.

He fell out with his father in 579, then revolted the following year. During his rebellion, he converted from Arianism to Chalcedonian Christianity. Hermenegild was defeated in 584 and exiled.

Liuvigild made his sons co-regents. In 579 he married Ingund, daughter of the Frankish King Sigebert I of Austrasia who was a Chalcedonian Christian. Her mother was the Visigoth princess Brunhilda of Austrasia. The twelve-year-old Ingund was pressured by Hermenegild's stepmother Goiswintha to abjure her beliefs, but she stayed firm in her faith.Gregory of Tours translated by Lewis Thorpe, History of the Franks (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974,) page 302 Liuvigild sent Hermenegild to the south to govern on his behalf. There he came under the influence of Leander of Seville, older brother of Isidore of Seville. Hermenegild was converted to Chalcedonian Christianity. His family demanded that he return to Arianism, but he refused. Around this time, he led a revolt against Liuvigild.

However, Liuvigild forced them to capitulate once again in 583. Hermenegild fled to Seville and when that fell to a siege in 584 went to C√≥rdoba. After Liuvigild paid 30,000 pieces of gold, the Byzantines withdrew, taking Ingund and her son with them. Hermenegild sought sanctuary in a church. Liuvigild would not violate the sanctuary. He sent Reccared inside to speak with Hermenegild and to offer peace. This was accepted and peace was made for some time. Imprisonment and death Goiswintha, however, brought about another alienation within the family. Hermenegild was imprisoned in Tarragona or Toledo. During his captivity in the tower of Seville, an Arian bishop was sent to Hermenegild for Easter but he would not accept the Eucharist from him.\\"Lives of the Saints: For Every Day of the Year\\" edited by Rev.

It premiered on Cartoon Network on July 19, 2003, and its first two seasons also aired on Kids' WB. Initially, only four seasons were planned, but the popularity of the series led to Cartoon Network ordering a fifth season. The final half-hour episode of the show, \\"Things Change\\", aired on January 16, 2006; it was later followed by a TV movie, Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo, that premiered on September 15, 2006, serving as the series finale. Teen Titans became one of Cartoon Network's well liked series, renowned for its character development and serious themes though the humor received criticism. During its run, the series was nominated for three Annie Awards and one Motion Picture Sound Editors Award. Spin-off media included comics, DVD releases, video games, music albums, and collectible toys. Reruns have aired on Cartoon Network's retro animation sister channel Boomerang until June 1, 2014. In 2013, the show spawned a spin-off, titled Teen Titans Go!, which received a theatrical film released on July 27, 2018, titled Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. Premise Cyborg, Robin, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Raven Teen Titans is based primarily on stories by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez from the 1980s, featuring characters, storylines, and concepts introduced during the run, and incorporating a similar group of members. The five main members of the eponymous team in the series are Robin (Scott Menville), the intelligent and capable leader of the Teen Titans; Starfire (Hynden Walch), a quirky, curious alien princess from the planet Tamaran; Cyborg (Khary Payton), a half- human/half-robot who is known for his strength and technological prowess; Raven (Tara Strong), a stoic girl from the parallel world Azarath who draws upon dark energy and psionic abilities; and Beast Boy (Greg Cipes), a good- natured joker who can transform into various animals. They are situated in Titans Tower, a large T-shaped building featuring living quarters, a command center, and a variety of training facilities, on an island just offshore from the West Coast metropolis of Jump City. The team deals with all manner of criminal activity and threats to the city, while dealing with their own struggles with adolescence, their mutual friendships, and their limitations. The first season focuses on the Teen Titans' introduction to the mysterious supervillain Slade (Ron Perlman), who seeks to turn Robin into his apprentice. The second season is an adaption of \\"The Judas Contract\\" storyline where new hero Terra (Ashley Johnson) joins the team while secretly plotting against them with Slade. The third season depicts Cyborg's conflict with the evil organization H.I.V.E. and their leader Brother Blood (John DiMaggio), prompting Cyborg to form the superhero team Titans East with Aqualad (Wil Wheaton), Speedy (Mike Erwin), Bumblebee (T'Keyah Crystal Keym√°h), and M√°s y Menos (Freddy Rodriguez). In the fourth season, Raven finds herself unwillingly involved in a plot that threatens the existence of the world when her demon father Trigon (Kevin Michael Richardson) seeks to enslave the Earth. For the fifth season, the Teen Titans join forces with numerous other heroes to combat the Brotherhood of Evil, Beast Boy's longtime adversaries, and their army of villains. Cast and characters =Main cast= * Scott Menville as Robin * Hynden Walch as Starfire * Khary Payton as Cyborg * Tara Strong as Raven * Greg Cipes as Beast Boy =Secret identities= Unlike most other superhero television series, the Teen Titans characters maintain their superhero identities at all times, with any hints at the concept of an alter ego or secret identity rarely explored. The secret identity of Robin, an alias assumed by multiple characters in the comics, is never explicitly revealed in the series. However, several hints are provided to suggest he is Dick Grayson, the original Robin and founding member of the Teen Titans. These include Robin's alternate dimensional counterpart Larry in the episode \\"Fractured\\" being named Nosyarg Kcid (\\"Dick Grayson\\" spelled backwards), Robin's future counterpart in the episode \\"How Long Is Forever?\\" having taken on the identity of Nightwing (Grayson's second superhero alias), his relationship with Starfire, and a glimpse into Robin's consciousness by Raven in the episode \\"Haunted\\" showing the memory of two acrobats falling from a trapeze (the death of Grayson's acrobat parents being the catalyst for him becoming Robin). Further connections to the Batman mythos include two references in the episode \\"The Apprentice, Pt. II\\", when Robin responds to a suggestion by the villain Slade that he \\"might be like a father to [him]\\" with \\"I already have a father\\" (which transitions to a shot of flying bats) and a fight scene on the rooftop of a building labeled Wayne Enterprises. The Teen Titans Go! episode ‚ÄúPermanent Record‚Äù would later satirize the mystery of Robin‚Äôs identity by explicitly giving his name as ‚ÄúRobin v.3: Tim Drake‚Äù (the third Robin), with the names of Dick Grayson and Jason Todd (the second Robin) being written over. Subsequent episodes, however, establish him as Grayson through vague flashbacks to his boyhood at Haley Circus. The policy of not mentioning the main characters' secret identities has been broken for all but Raven. For Beast Boy, at the end of the Season 5 premiere, the Doom Patrol members referred to him by his real name, Garfield (though the Titans still continue to call him Beast Boy); and in \\"Go!\\", the Titans asked him about his mask and he stated it hides his true identity, though Raven pointed out that his green skin makes him instantly recognizable regardless of his clothing. For Starfire, her real name Princess Koriand'r was used when the Teen Titans visited Tamaran in \\"Betrothed.\\" And for Cyborg, when he goes undercover at H.I.V.E. Academy in \\"Deception,\\" he takes on the alias \\"Stone\\" as a reference to his comic counterpart's real name, Victor Stone. Later seasons of Teen Titans Go! have, though infrequently, referred to Cyborg as Victor Stone and Beast Boy as Garfield Logan. Episodes Production =Soundtrack= The series is known for featuring both an English and Japanese version of its title theme song, created by Andy Sturmer and performed by the Japanese band Puffy AmiYumi. The title theme used in the regions where the show was broadcast varied; some would play only one version, while Japan - and the English language video editions - would use both, according to the respective episode's plot theme: The English lyrics for more serious stories, the Japanese version for more comedic tones. The first season episode \\"Mad Mod\\" also featured another song by Puffy AmiYumi, \\"K2G\\". In the feature-length movie Trouble in Tokyo, a literal translation of the Japanese song, whose actual lyrics differ greatly from its English counterpart, is performed for comedic effect. =Cancellation= In mid-November 2005, TitansTower.com reported that prospects for a sixth season were looking extremely unlikely, and fans were urged to express their support for the show to Cartoon Network. Several days after this initial posting, word came that Cartoon Network had officially terminated the show. According to Wil Wheaton, the actor who provided the voice of Aqualad, the series was terminated by new Warner Bros. Feature Animation executives who made the decision not to renew the series based on its sixth season pitch. interview transcript Wheaton's story was contradicted by series story editor Rob Hoegee, who stated that the decision came from Cartoon Network, not WB, and that the crew was informed during the writing phase of season five, that there are no plans for a sixth season. The show's producer David Slack indicated that he was given different reasons for the show's cancellation; either the ratings dropped after \\"scary\\" season 4 or Mattel wanted the show dead because Bandai had the show's toy deal. Cartoon Network announced that Mattel had become its \\"master toy licensee\\" in 2006. After the last episode, Warner Bros. Animation announced a feature film titled Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo. The film premiered at San Diego Comic-Con International and was shown on Cartoon Network first on September 15, 2006, aired on Kids' WB on September 16, 2006, and finally released on DVD on February 6, 2007. =Crossover with Teen Titans Go!= A mid-credits scene from Teen Titans Go! To the Movies featured the 2003 Titans' return, in which Robin states they've \\"found a way back\\". In early 2019, Warner Bros. announced that a crossover featuring the Titans from both shows, titled Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans, was in development. On June 26, 2019, IGN released the official trailer on YouTube. The film premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2019. This was followed by a digital release on September 24, 2019 and a DVD and Blu-ray release on October 15, 2019.‚ÄòTeen Titans‚Äô Talent Reflects on OG, New Series Movie Matchup - Media Play News The events of the film take place during the fifth season of Teen Titans Go!. Legacy The series was revisited as a series of shorts in 2012 for the DC Nation programming block on Cartoon Network. Dubbed New Teen Titans, the shorts began airing on September 11, 2012. The shorts featured the Titans in chibi form, with the principal cast members of the original series returning. Teen Titans Go! was announced as a spin-off, with many voices the same, but not significantly related in terms of story to both the Teen Titans series, and the New Teen Titans shorts. The series premiered on April 23, 2013. Menville, Payton, Strong, Cipes, and Walch reprised their respective character roles as Robin, Cyborg, Raven, Beast Boy, Starfire and Blackfire in DC Super Hero Girls. Payton reprised his role as Cyborg in Lego DC Comics: Batman Be- Leaguered, Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League, Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League ‚Äì Attack of the Legion of Doom, Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League ‚Äì Cosmic Clash, Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League ‚Äì Gotham City Breakout along with Cipes, Walch, and Menville (although he played the Damian Wayne Robin), Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash, and Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Aquaman: Rage of Atlantis. He has also reprised his role as Cyborg on Justice League Action. Several character details from Teen Titans, like Raven's standard incantation Azarath Metrion Zinthos and Beast Boy's super-werewolf form from the episode \\"The Beast Within\\", were incorporated into the animated movie Justice League vs. Teen Titans. =Impact on DC continuity= Teen Titans has never been established to be a part of the larger DC animated universe or The Batman animated series. Series producer Bruce Timm stated the series would not cross over with Justice League Unlimited. Despite this the series was alluded to in Static Shock, which is part of the DCAU like Justice League Unlimited, where Static asked Batman where Robin was to which Batman responded, \\"With the Titans...You'll meet them some day.\\" The character Speedy, who first appeared in the episode \\"Winner Take All\\", later appeared in Justice League Unlimited with the same costume design and voice actor (Mike Erwin) as the Teen Titans incarnation (though he is older in appearance). Kid Flash was voiced by Michael Rosenbaum in his appearances in the show, who was the same actor who voiced the Flash in Justice League Unlimited. The follow-up series, Teen Titans Go!, has featured several appearances by Batman, but they have all been non-speaking appearances. Both Batman and Alfred Pennyworth appear in DC Nation's New Teen Titans \\"Red X Unmasked\\". In the season 2 episode of Teen Titans Go!, \\"Let's Get Serious\\", Aqualad (voiced by Khary Payton), Superboy, and Miss Martian of the Young Justice team appear. Much like X-Men: Evolution and Batman: The Animated Series, the series has affected the comics that initially inspired it, including: Beast Boy adopting the series' purple and black outfit during DC's \\"52\\" storyline and later appearing with the pointed ears and fanged teeth originated by the series, future Cyborg having the same armor pattern of his animated counterpart in the Titans Tomorrow storyline, Raven adapting her animated counterpart's costume design in the \\"One Year Later\\" storyline, the characters M√°s Y Menos making appearances in 52 and the Final Crisis limited series,Final Crisis #1. DC Comics. the character Joto was renamed \\"Hotspot\\" during 52 to match his cartoon counterpart,Teen Titans #38. DC Comics. and the villain Cinderblock appearing in a fight with the comic incarnation of the Titans.Titans (vol. 2) #17. DC Comics. In other media =Comics= DC Comics published a comic book series based on Teen Titans named Teen Titans Go!. The series was written by J. Torres and Todd Nauck, Larry Stucker was the regular illustrator. The series focuses on Robin, Raven, Starfire, Beast Boy, and Cyborg who are the main cast members of the television series. While the comic's stories stand independently, its issues were done so as not to contradict events established in the animated series' episodes. Often, Teen Titans Go! also referenced episodes of the show, as well as expanding on parts of the series. =Toys= Bandai released a line of action figures based on the Teen Titans animated series. The line included 1.5 inch \\"Comic Book Hero\\" mini figures, 3.5 inch action figures (including \\"Teen Titans Launch Tower Playset\\", \\"Teen Titans Command Center\\", \\"Battling Machines\\", \\"T-Vehicles\\", \\"T-Sub Deluxe Vehicles\\"), 5 inch action figures, 6.5 inch plush Super-D Toys, and 10 inch figures. Amongst the characters included in the line were the main members of the Teen Titans, Titans East, and various allies and villains. Reception =Critical reception= The series has received very positive reviews. Early into the series' run, Executive Producer and Cartoon Network Vice President Sam Register responded to criticism regarding the style of the show with a statement slightly contradicting Murakami's statement about wanting Robin to \\"be cool\\" with his metal-tipped boots: However, while the series' creators initially stated that younger children were the intended audience for the series, Teen Titans Go! writer J. Torres notes that the progression and deeper themes of the show widened the appeal to a much broader audience: In 2009, Teen Titans was named the 83rd best animated series by IGN. =Awards and nominations= ;2005 Annie Awards * Outstanding Storyboarding in an Animated Television Production (Nominated) ;2004 Annie Awards * Outstanding Music in an Animated Television Production (Nominated) * Outstanding Storyboarding in an Animated Television Production (Nominated) ;2004 Motion Picture Sound Editors Awards: * Best Sound Editing in Television Animation (Nominated) See also * Justice League (TV series) * Justice League Unlimited * Young Justice (TV series) References External links * Official DC Comics Site  David Slack Interviews: Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, Season 4, Season 5 Category:2000s American animated television series Category:2003 American television series debuts Category:2006 American television series endings Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated drama television series Category:American children's animated science fantasy television series Category:American children's animated space adventure television series Category:American children's animated superhero television series Category:Animated television series about robots Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Animated television shows based on DC Comics Category:Anime-influenced Western animated television series Category:Cartoon Network original programming Category:Cyborgs in television Category:English-language television shows Category:Teen animated television series Category:Teen superhero television shows Category:Television series about alien visitations Category:Television series about demons Category:Television series about shapeshifting Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

It is named after Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Herzl's tomb lies at the top of the hill. Yad Vashem, which commemorates the Holocaust, lies to the west of Mt. Herzl. Israel's war dead are also buried there. Mount Herzl is 834 meters above sea level. History In 1934, Zionist leader Menahem Ussishkin organized the re-interment of Leon Pinsker in Nicanor Cave on Mount Scopus in an attempt to build a pantheon for the great leaders of the Jewish nation. Ussishkin was buried there himself in 1941. When Mount Scopus became an enclave, cut off from Jerusalem, the implementation of this plan was no longer feasible. For Israel's early leaders, burials were all about location During summer 1949, Theodor Herzl's remains were reinterred on a hill in West Jerusalem which faced the Mount of Olives from a distance and renamed in his honour, Mount Herzl. In November 1949, soldiers who fell during the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war in the Jerusalem area were buried on the north slope of the hill. Apart from Theodor Herzl, Mt. Herzl is the burial place of five of Israel's prime ministers: Levi Eshkol, Golda Meir, Yitzhak Shamir, Yitzhak Rabin (who is buried beside his wife Leah) and Shimon Peres. Israeli presidents are also buried on Mt. Herzl, as are other prominent Jewish and Zionist leaders. Mt. Herzl is the venue for many commemorative events and national celebrations. The military section was designed and landscaped by two Hungarian-born architects, Asher Hiram and Haim Giladi. Theodor Herzl's grave Herzl's grave on the north side of Mount Herzl plaza In 1903, Theodor Herzl wrote in his will: > I wish to be buried in a metal coffin next to my father, and to remain there > until the Jewish people will transfer my remains to Eretz Israel. The > coffins of my father, my sister Pauline, and of my close relatives who will > have died until then will also be transferred there. When Herzl died a year later, he was interred in Vienna. Forty-five years later, Herzl's remains were brought to Israel and re-interred in Jerusalem. The location of the burial site was selected by a special state commission in the top of a hill in Jerusalem. He was buried on 17 August 1949. A temporary stone marked his grave for several years until the site was developed into a national cemetery. Sixty-three entries were submitted in the competition for the design of his new tombstone. The winner was Joseph Klarwein's design, consisting of an unadorned black granite stone inscribed with the name Herzl.Landscape and Ideology: Reinterment of Renowned Jews in the Land of Israel, Doron Bar The area around his tomb was expanded into the plaza where the first Independence Day ceremony was held in 1950. Despite Herzl's wishes, his daughter Pauline and son Hans were not originally buried beside him. Their remains were moved to Mt. Herzl in 2006. A third daughter was murdered in the Holocaust and her place of burial is unknown. The small Stephen Norman Park, located between the Herzl Museum and the Herzl Educational Center, is dedicated to the memory of Herzl's only grandson, who took his own life in the United States in 1946 after learning about the fate of his family during the Holocaust and being confronted with Jewish misery in the Displaced Persons camps, and was reinterred on Mt. Herzl in December 2007. Herzl's parents and sister are also buried at Mount Herzl. Yitzhak and Leah Rabin's graves in the National Leaders section National Civil Cemetery Israel's main cemetery for the leaders of the country and people who sacrificed their lives for the country is located on the southern slope of Mt. Herzl, established there in 1952 when Ben Gurion decided to bury the finance minister in Helkat Gedolei Ha'Uma, close to Herzl's grave. The design of the cemetery area was continued over the following years when other famous people from the Zionist movement were brought to be buried there. =Great Leaders of the Nation= The Great Leaders of the Nation's Plot or Memorial Park holds the graves of several Prime Ministers, Presidents, Knesset speakers and other chosen national leaders of the State of Israel. It forms a separate section of the Mount Herzl cemetery from that of the leaders of the Zionist Organization (after 1960: World Zionist Organization), which is situated nearby. The Hebrew name Helkat Gedolei Ha'Uma () is used in common parlance either in a narrower meaning, for the State of Israel leaders' section, or in a wider one, which includes pre- state Zionist leaders. Buried there are Presidents Zalman Shazar and Chaim Herzog, Shimon Peres and Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol, Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and his wife Leah Rabin. Other notable graves are those of the first speaker of the Knesset, Yosef Sprinzak and his wife Hanna, the first Minister of Finance, Eliezer Kaplan, and Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek. Despite the national significance of the cemetery, some Israeli leaders were buried elsewhere, most notably Chaim Weizmann (buried at Weizmann House), David Ben- Gurion (buried at Midreshet Ben-Gurion) and Menachem Begin (buried at Mount of Olives). Deciding who should be buried on Mt. Herzl has sometimes been controversial. For example, the decision to bury Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who died in 1940, on Mt. Herzl, was fiercely opposed by many Labour Party stalwarts, who claimed that Jabotinsky was an ultra-right nationalist undeserving of such an honour. Only in 1964 did Prime Minister Levi Eshkol decide in favor of burying him there, in the interest of promoting national reconciliation and setting aside political grievances. Soldiers awarded with the Medal of Valor may also be buried at Mount Herzl. To the north of Herzl's grave is a plot reserved for the leaders of the (World) Zionist Organization, among them David Wolffsohn, Nahum Sokolow, Simcha Dinitz, and Arieh Dulzin. In the same section are the graves and cenotaphs of close relatives of Theodor Herzl. The grave of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his family is in a separate plot southwest of Herzl's grave. =Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial= Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial The Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial is the main memorial for all victims of terrorism in Israel from 1851 until today. The memorial was opened in 1997, and every year a ceremony is held on the plaza, in memory of the victims of terror. The memorial is located in the National Civil Cemetery next to Helkat Gedolei Ha'Uma. =Other memorials= * Olei Hagardom plot: Jewish underground fighters executed for their activities * Common grave of the 204 illegal immigrants who went down with the Salvador in December 1940Corry Guttstadt, Turkey, the Jews, and the Holocaust, p. 113.

Herzl military cemetery, 2010 The main Israel Defense Forces cemetery is located on the northern slope of Mt. Herzl. It was established in November 1949, when soldiers who fell in the Jerusalem area were buried here. In 1949, the government decided to turn the site into the main cemetery for IDF members who have fallen in the line of duty. The Israel Police cemetery, for police officers who have fallen in the line of duty, is also located there. There are specific areas or monuments for following categories of fallen fighters, * National Memorial Hall For Israel's Fallen * Garden of the Missing in Action (burial places are unknown) * Memorial for the Jewish soldiers in the Red Army in World War II * Memorial for the Jewish soldiers in the Polish Army in World War II * Memorial for the volunteers of the Yishuv (Jewish community in Palestine) in World War II * Memorial for the 140 Jewish Palestinian soldiers who went down with the British ship SS Erinpura in 1943 during World War II * Memorial for the 23 (in Hebrew numerals: Kaf-Gimel) Palmach sea commandoes who disappeared during Operation Boatswain under British command in 1941 * Common grave of the Nabi Daniel Convoy of 27 March 1948 (15 dead) * Monument for the fallen fighters of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem (surrendered on 28 May 1948) * Memorial for the 69 sailors who went down with the Dakar submarine in 1968 and whose bodies were never recovered * Common grave of the defenders of Neve Yaakov who fell in 1948 * Common grave of the fighters fallen in the Battles of Latrun of 1948 * Common grave of the Radar Hill fighters * Common grave of the defenders of Kfar Etzion who fell in 1948 * Common grave of the Convoy of 35 of January 1948 * Memorial for the Jewish Parachutists of Mandate Palestine killed in Europe in World War II * Operation Kadesh (1956) plot * Operation Peace for Galilee (First Lebanon War, 1982) plot * Soldiers who fell since 1990 * Six-Day War, one of several plots * Yom Kippur War, one of several plots All soldiers, regardless of rank or unit, are buried side by side. The gravestones are plain and unadorned, only recording name, rank, parents' names, and place and date of birth and death. =Christian, Muslim, and Druze soldiers= The military cemetery also honours the memory of Israel's fallen Christian, Muslim, and Druze soldiers who have served in the Israeli security forces. There are several soldiers listed from Daliyat al-Karmel, Usifiyah, Tuba-Zangariyye, and other Arab and Druze towns and villages on this Israeli government memorial site. According to this site, these soldiers have a stone marker representing them at Mount Herzl. =Garden of the Missing in Action= The Garden of the Missing in Action is a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Memorial and Memory Garden for soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces and those who fought for the pre-state Land of Israel whose resting places are unknown from 1914 until today. The garden was established on 29 February 2004 in a ceremony attended by army chiefs, the Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, and members of the Jerusalem Municipality at the National Military and Police cemetery. The garden also contains memorials to those lost aboard the submarine INS Dakar and the 23 Who Went Down at Sea. An annual memorial service for the Missing Soldiers of Israel takes place in the garden's main plaza on Seventh of Adar day. The garden includes \\"empty graves\\" and stone monuments to the memory of missing soldiers. At the entrance to the garden, there is a small plaza where memorial ceremonies to the missing are held. On the north side of the plaza there is a memorial to the missing sailors of the INS Dakar submarine, which sank in the Mediterranean sea. On the north side of the plaza is a memorial wall bearing the names of all missing soldiers and fighters from 1914 until today. On the top of the wall there is a waterfall.

It is designed in the shape of a torch rising some 18 meters and an eternal flame burns there all year long. A candle for each soldier is lit twice a year ‚Äî once on the anniversary of the soldier's death, and on Memorial Day. The cost of the project was NIS40 million.  Gardens  Above the Herzl Museum and the main plaza is the Nations Garden, where trees have been planted by visiting presidents and heads of state. There are two small observation decks looking out over Jerusalem. A menorah sculpture stands opposite the main plaza entrance. Situated between the Herzl Museum and the Stella and Alexander Margulies Education Center, the Stephen Norman Garden is named for Herzl's grandson, Stephen Norman. He was the only member of Herzl's family to visit Palestine or to be a Zionist. It is a place for groups and students to gather to hear about Mount Herzl. On one wall of the garden, a quote from Norman, in 1945, is inscribed: \\"You will be amazed at the Jewish youth in Palestine...they have the look of freedom.\\" Museums and study centers =Herzl Museum= Entrance to Herzl museum Herzl Museum, an interactive museum on the at the main entrance to Mt. Herzl, offers a glimpse into the life of Theodor Herzl, the man behind the dream of a Jewish homeland. =Yad Vashem= Yad Vashem is in the western region of Mount Herzl on the Mount of Remembrance in Jerusalem, 804 meters above sea level and adjacent to the Jerusalem Forest. Yad Vashem is complex containing two types of sites - memorial museums and monuments, and a research institute. Memorial sites include the Holocaust History Museum and the Museum of Holocaust Art; indoor memorials such as the Children's Memorial and the Hall of Remembrance; outdoor commemorative sites such as the Valley of the Communities, the Cattle Car memorial and various sculptures; and a synagogue. The Holocaust research facilities are grouped around a research institute and include archives, a library, publishing house and an educational center, The International School for Holocaust Studies. Yad Vashem honours non-Jews who saved Jews during the Holocaust, at great personal risk, as the \\"Righteous among the Nations\\". The Memorial Path, leading from the entrance of Yad Vashem up to the Mount Herzl national cemetery, was established in 2003 and includes plaques that mark important events from the beginning of Zionism until the creation of the state of Israel. =Zionism study center= In 2010, work began on a Zionism Studies Center next to the Herzl museum, with the opening scheduled for 2013. Archaeology Mitspe Karem () is an archaeological park located in the Jerusalem Forest on the west side of the Mount of Remembrance, near the Yad Vashem museum. There are finds from various periods, including the Early Bronze Age, Iron Age, possibly Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine period.

One of the new requirements placed upon all clergy was the necessity of an oath of loyalty to the state before all foreign influences such as the Pope. This created a schism within the French clergy, with those taking the oath known as juring priests, and those refusing the oath known as non-juring or refractory priests.  Background  In the centuries preceding the French Revolution, the Church had functioned as an autonomous entity within French borders. It controlled roughly 10% of all French land, levied mandatory tithes upon the populace, and collected revenues from its estates, all of which contributed to the Church‚Äôs total income which it was not obliged to disclose to the state.William Doyle, Origins of the French Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 66. Under the ancien regime, France was divided into three Estates, and the clergy occupied the First Estate, with the aristocracy comprising the Second Estate, and the commoners the Third Estate. As one of the first two privileged Estates, the Church was exempt from all taxation, although every five years the Assembly of the Clergy met and arranged a don gratuit (free gift) to be given to the King on behalf of the Church.William Doyle, Origins of the French Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 67. Over the course of the 18th century, France fell into deeper and deeper financial crisis. On multiple occasions, the state attempted to revoke the Church‚Äôs tax-free status in order to tap into its significant financial resources, with official declarations calling for formal surveys of the Church‚Äôs wealth and subsequent taxations being levied in 1749 and 1780. Both were successfully rebuffed by the Church, whose infrastructure, organization, man-power, and influence were unrivaled in France.William Doyle, Origins of the French Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 67. Nonetheless, these events show that a desire to check the power and privileges of the Church was gaining momentum before the Revolution erupted.  During the French Revolution  In an attempt to find a peaceful resolution to mounting popular unrest and calls for reform, King Louis XVI first convened the Assembly of Notables in 1787 and then revived the Estates-General in 1789. During the 1787 Assembly, clerical representatives strongly opposed any reforms directed towards the Church,William Doyle, Origins of the French Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 93. but by the meeting of the Estates-General, internal divisions began to form. Bishops and other ‚Äòhigh clergy‚Äô (who were often of noble stock) allied strongly with the Second Estate in the preservation of official privileges. However, many parish priests and other ‚Äòlow clergy‚Äô sided with the Third Estate, representing their own class and the class of their flocks.David P. Jordan, The King's Trial: Louis XVI vs. The French Revolution (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 23. Things began to change quickly in 1789. On August 4, the newly assembled National Assembly drafted the ‚ÄòDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,‚Äô and over the next year completely dismantled French society and rebuilt it from the ground up. Part of this included nationalizing all Church lands and transferring ownership to the state.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 29-30. By June 1790 the Assembly had officially abolished the nobility, and on July 12 passed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. = Civil Constitution of the Clergy = This new legislation dismantled and restructured the Church along the same lines it had the rest of society. Bishoprics were realigned to correspond with the eighty-three departments France had been divided into, while all additional bishoprics were abolished.\\"Civil Constitution of the Clergy,\\" Title I, Article II All clergy were forbidden from recognizing the authority of any Church officials beholden to a foreign power, and this included the Pope, whose position they were allowed to acknowledge, but not his authority.\\"Civil Constitution of the Clergy,\\" Title I, Article IV New bishops were forbidden from seeking confirmation from the Pope, but were allowed to write him to inform him of their position and reassert a unity of faith.\\"Civil Constitution of the Clergy,\\" Title II, Article XIX The most contentions aspects of the constitution, however, involved how new bishops would be appointed to office and the duties required of them. The Church was now essentially completely incorporated as a branch of government, and bishops were to be elected by popular vote.\\"Civil Constitution of the Clergy,\\" Title II, Article II This was received with outrage by many clergy, as it not only completely up-ended the top-down appointment system of the Church, but would then allow Protestants, Jews, and atheists to directly influence Church matters.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 31. What would cause the greatest problems though, was Article XXI of Title II. This required bishops to take an oath before municipal officials asserting their loyalty to the nation of France before all other things, or their office would be declared vacant.\\"Civil Constitution of the Clergy,\\" Title II, Article XXI Sentiments between the Church and the Revolution began to sour much faster after this. While reform had been the only stated goal by revolutionaries before, anti-religious rhetoric calling for the abolishment of the Church as a whole began to gain prominence. Fabre d‚ÄôEglantine described the Church‚Äôs singular purpose as being to ‚Äúsubjugate the human species and enslave it under their dominion.‚Äù In October 1790, the National Convention banned priests, monks, nuns, and any who had previously occupied such positions from teaching in schools, and many members of the Convention began calling for a ‚Äúreligion of patriotism‚Äù to supplant Catholic Christianity entirely.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 240. In November, the oath described in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was drafted, and by the end of the year the Assembly proclaimed executive authority to enforce said oath.David P. Jordan, The King's Trial: Louis XVI vs. The French Revolution (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 23. = Refractory Clergy = The oath of loyalty created a massive schism within the clergy. Many lower clergy had supported revolutionary calls for reform, even reform within the Church, but this was beyond the pale. Thousands of priests, monks, and nuns now had to choose between refusing the oath and risking arrest and punishment, or taking the oath and risking their salvation. In March 1791, the Pope forced the issue by issuing a papal bull officially condemning the Revolution's actions towards the Church and leveling excommunication upon any clergy who took the oath.David P. Jordan, The King's Trial: Louis XVI vs. The French Revolution (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 23. The clergy was then split into juring priests (those who took the oath) and non-juring or refractory priests (those who refused). Both factions could face persecution, as communities with strong revolutionary sentiments would beat, stone, or even kill non-juring priests, while in more religiously traditional communities juring priests could face similar assaults.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 31. This controversy was the first major issue to divide the popular masses on revolutionary reforms. Never had royalists or other counter-revolutionaries had popular constituencies, but there were many who believed the state had no right to meddle in the affairs of God to this degree and were loyal to their local priests. Also, sectors of France that had long-standing conflict with Protestant communities refused to support anything that threatened Catholic supremacy.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 32. Many clergy previously supportive of the Revolution were driven into opposition, and thousands of clergy hid or fled the country entirely.David P. Jordan, The King's Trial: Louis XVI vs. The French Revolution (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 23-24. = Impact = While there were organized efforts to hunt down refractory priests and organized protests of religious ceremonies, many revolutionary leaders began to see all this as detrimental to the movement. Some were vehemently ethically opposed, such as Maximilien Robespierre, who argued that atheism was a dangerous product of aristocratic decadence, and believed that a moral society should at least acknowledge the provenance of a Supreme Being. Others had more practical objections, knowing that deep-seated religious beliefs would not be eliminated quickly, and that mobilizing popular support for the Revolution was of top importance. Dividing and alienating the masses over religious issues was unhelpful.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 241. Throughout all this, Louis XVI was appalled. Louis was a deeply devout man, and while he was required to give public approval to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, he rejected it in private. On Palm Sunday in April 1791, he took communion from a non-juring priest.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 32. While friends, advisors, and even his wife had been strongly urging him to flee the country, Louis had resisted these suggestions. The attack on the clergy was potentially the tipping point that eventually led to the King‚Äôs doomed flight to Varennes in June 1791.David P. Jordan, The King's Trial: Louis XVI vs. The French Revolution (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 24.

It has been introduced to New Zealand, where it is sometimes known as the Avondale spider as they are commonly found in the suburb of Avondale, Auckland. This was the species used in the beginning of the 2002 movie Spider-Man, a part in Australian movie Napoleon and widely in Arachnophobia, and all films depict them as having a deadly venomous bite, but they are generally considered harmless to humans in real-life. It was first described by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1837. Behavior frameless Highly unusual among spiders, the flat huntsman spider is a social species, even sharing prey. They are often found under loose bark (their flat shape is an adaptation for this) in colonies up to 300, but they are highly aggressive and commonly cannibalistic toward members from other colonies. They hunt their food rather than spin webs for it. They are timid towards humans and bites are infrequent, and when they occur, symptoms are usually very minor. Distribution Avondale Spider Sculpture in Avondale, Auckland The species is found all over Australia, including Tasmania. It was introduced to New Zealand in 1924. Its range in New Zealand expanded slowly out of Avondale, a suburb of Auckland, hence the alternative New Zealand common name. There is a sculpture in the Avondale shopping centre celebrating the spider. Appearance and genetics Male D. cancerides have a body length of , while females are larger, with a body length of . The body is light brown and covered in dense, fine hairs. The legs are also hairy, and can have a span of over .

Refractories are inorganic, nonmetallic, porous, and heterogeneous. They are typically composed of oxides of the following materials: silicon, aluminium, magnesium, calcium, and zirconium. ASTM C71 defines refractories as \\"...non- metallic materials having those chemical and physical properties that make them applicable for structures, or as components of systems, that are exposed to environments above .\\"ASTM Volume 15.01 Refractories; Activated Carbon, Advanced Ceramics Refractory materials are used in furnaces, kilns, incinerators, and reactors. Refractories are also used to make crucibles and moulds for casting glass and metals and for surfacing flame deflector systems for rocket launch structures.Refractory Materials for Flame Deflector Protection System Corrosion Control: Similar Industries and/or Launch Facilities Survey - January 2009 - NASA Today, the iron- and steel-industry and metal casting sectors use approximately 70% of all refractories produced. Refractory materials Refractory materials must be chemically and physically stable at high temperatures. Depending on the operating environment, they must be resistant to thermal shock, be chemically inert, and/or have specific ranges of thermal conductivity and of the coefficient of thermal expansion. The oxides of aluminium (alumina), silicon (silica) and magnesium (magnesia) are the most important materials used in the manufacturing of refractories. Another oxide usually found in refractories is the oxide of calcium (lime). Fire clays are also widely used in the manufacture of refractories. Refractories must be chosen according to the conditions they face. Some applications require special refractory materials. Zirconia is used when the material must withstand extremely high temperatures. Silicon carbide and carbon (graphite) are two other refractory materials used in some very severe temperature conditions, but they cannot be used in contact with oxygen, as they would oxidize and burn. Binary compounds such as tungsten carbide or boron nitride can be very refractory. Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known, with a melting point of 3890 ¬∞C.Hafnium, Los Alamos National Laboratory The ternary compound tantalum hafnium carbide has one of the highest melting points of all known compounds (4215 ¬∞C).  Uses  Refractory materials are useful for the following functions: # Serving as a thermal barrier between a hot medium and the wall of a containing vessel # Withstanding physical stresses and preventing erosion of vessel walls due to the hot medium # Protecting against corrosion # Providing thermal insulation Refractories have multiple useful applications. In the metallurgy industry, refractories are used for lining furnaces, kilns, reactors, and other vessels which hold and transport hot mediums such as metal and slag. Refractories have other high temperature applications such as fired heaters, hydrogen reformers, ammonia primary and secondary reformers, cracking furnaces, utility boilers, catalytic cracking units, air heaters, and sulfur furnaces. Classification of refractory materials Refractories are classified in multiple ways, based on: # Chemical composition # Method of manufacture # Fusion temperature # Refractoriness # Thermal conductivity =Based on chemical composition= Acidic refractories Acidic refractories are generally impervious to acidic materials but easily attacked by basic materials, and are thus used with acidic slag in acidic environments. They include substances such as silica, alumina, and fire clay brick refractories. Notable reagents that can attack both alumina and silica are hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, and fluorinated gases (e.g. HF, F2). At high temperatures, acidic refractories may also react with limes and basic oxides. * Silica refractories are refractories containing more than 93% silicon oxide (SiO2). They are acidic, have high resistance to thermal shock, flux and slag resistance, and high spalling resistance. Silica bricks are often used in the iron and steel industry as furnace materials. An important property of silica brick is its ability to maintain hardness under high loads until its fusion point. * Zirconia refractories are refractories primarily composed of zirconium oxide (ZrO2). They are often used for glass furnaces because they have low thermal conductivity, are not easily wetted by molten glass and have low reactivity with molten glass. These refractories are also useful for applications in high temperature construction materials. * Aluminosilicate refractories mainly consist of alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2). Aluminosilicate refractories can be semiacidic, fireclay composite, or high alumina content composite. Basic refractories Basic refractories are used in areas where slags and atmosphere are basic. They are stable to alkaline materials but can react to acids. The main raw materials belong to the RO group, of which magnesia (MgO) is a common example. Other examples include dolomite and chrome- magnesia. For the first half of the twentieth century, the steel making process used artificial periclase (roasted magnesite) as a furnace lining material. * Magnesite refractories are composed of ‚â• 85% magnesium oxide (MgO). They have high slag resistance to lime and iron-rich slags, strong abrasion and corrosion resistance, and high refractoriness under load, and are typically used in metallurgical furnaces. * Dolomite refractories mainly consist of calcium magnesium carbonate. Typically, dolomite refractories are used in converter and refining furnaces. * Magnesia-chrome refractories mainly consist of magnesium oxide (MgO) and chromium oxide (Cr2O3). These refractories have high refractoriness and have a high tolerance for corrosive environments. Neutral refractories These are used in areas where slags and atmosphere are either acidic or basic and are chemically stable to both acids and bases. The main raw materials belong to, but are not confined to, the R2O3 group. Common examples of these materials are alumina (Al2O3), chromia (Cr2O3) and carbon. * Carbon graphite refractories mainly consist of carbon. These refractories are often used in highly reducing environments, and their properties of high refractoriness allow them excellent thermal stability and resistance to slags. * Chromite refractories are composed of sintered magnesia and chromia. They have constant volume at high temperatures, high refractoriness, and high resistance to slags. * Alumina refractories are composed of ‚â• 50% alumina (Al2O3). =Based on method of manufacture= #Dry press process #Fused cast #Hand molded #Formed (normal, fired or chemically bonded) #Un-formed (monolithic-plastic, ramming and gunning mass, castables, mortars, dry vibrating cements.) #Un-formed dry refractories. Shaped These have standard size and shapes. These may be further divided into standard shapes and special shapes. Standard shapes have dimension that are conformed by most refractory manufacturers and are generally applicable to kilns or furnaces of the same types. Standard shapes are usually bricks that have a standard dimension of 9 inches (23011464 mm) and this dimension is called a \\"one brick equivalent\\". \\"Brick equivalents\\" are used in estimating how many refractory bricks it takes to make an installation into an industrial furnace. There are ranges of standard shapes of different sizes manufactured to produce walls, roofs, arches, tubes and circular apertures etc. Special shapes are specifically made for specific locations within furnaces and for particular kilns or furnaces. Special shapes are usually less dense and therefore less hard wearing than standard shapes. Unshaped (monolithic refractories) These are without definite form and are only given shape upon application. These types are better known as monolithic refractories. The common examples are plastic masses, Ramming masses, castables, gunning masses, fettling mix, mortars etc. Dry vibration linings often used in Induction furnace linings are also monolithic, and sold and transported as a dry powder, usually with a magnesia/alumina composition with additions of other chemicals for altering specific properties. They are also finding more applications in blast furnace linings, although this use is still rare. =Based on fusion temperature= Refractory materials are classified into three types based on fusion temperature (melting point). *Normal refractories have a fusion temperature of 1580 ~ 1780 ¬∞C (e.g. Fire clay) *High refractories have a fusion temperature of 1780 ~ 2000 ¬∞C (e.g. Chromite) *Super refractories have a fusion temperature of > 2000 ¬∞C (e.g. Zirconia) =Based on refractoriness= Refractoriness is the property of a refractory's multiphase to reach a specific softening degree at high temperature without load, and is measured with a pyrometric cone equivalent (PCE) test. Refractories are classified as: * Super duty: PCE value of 33‚Äì38 * High duty: PCE value of 30‚Äì33 * Intermediate duty: PCE value of 28‚Äì30 * Low duty: PCE value of 19‚Äì28 =Based on thermal conductivity= Refractories may be classified by thermal conductivity as either conducting, nonconducting, or insulating. Examples of conducting refractories are SiC and ZrC, whereas examples of nonconducting refractories are silica and alumina. Insulating refractories include calcium silicate materials, kaolin, and zirconia. Insulating refractories are used to reduce the rate of heat loss through furnace walls. These refractories have low thermal conductivity due to a high degree of porosity, with a desired porous structure of small, uniform pores evenly distributed throughout the refractory brick in order to minimize thermal conductivity. Insulating refractories can be further classified into four types: # Heat-resistant insulating materials with application temperatures ‚â§ 1100 ¬∫C # Refractory insulating materials with application temperatures ‚â§ 1400 ¬∫C # High refractory insulating materials with application temperatures ‚â§ 1700 ¬∫C # Ultra-high refractory insulating materials with application temperatures ‚â§ 2000 ¬∫C  Refractory anchorage  All refractories require anchorage systems such as wire formed anchors, formed metal (for example, hexmetal) or ceramic tiles to support the refractory linings. The anchorage used for refractories on roofs and vertical walls are more critical as they must remain able to support the weight of refractories even at the elevated temperatures and operating conditions. The commonly used anchorages have circular or rectangular cross- sections. Circular cross-sections are used for low thickness refractory and they support less weight per unit area; whereas the rectangular cross-section is used for high thickness refractory and can support higher weight of refractory per unit area. The number of anchors depends on operating conditions and the refractory materials. The choice of an anchor's material, shape, quantity, and size has significant impact on the useful life of the refractory.

Originating from ethnic Lao people, it is also eaten throughout Southeast Asia. Locally known in Thailand as som tam (, ), in Laos as tam som (), or the more specific name tam maak hoong (, ), in Cambodia as bok l'hong (, ), and in Vietnam as g·ªèi ƒëu ƒë·ªß. Som tam, the Thai variation, was listed at number 46 on World's 50 most delicious foods compiled by CNN Go in 2011 and 2018. History The green papaya salad was adapted from an ethnic Lao dish known as tam som (literally \\"pounding [of] sour [ingredients]\\"), which used local fruits and vegetables such as green (unripe) mango or cucumbers as the main ingredient, seasoned to a primarily sour flavour. Following the Columbian Exchange, non-native crops such as tomato, papaya, corn, pineapple and chili peppers were introduced to Southeast Asia probably through the various sea ports of modern-day Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam via the PhilippinesOrillaneda, B. (2018). Maritime Trade in the Philippines During the 15th Century CE. [online] Journals.openedition.org. Available at: https://journals.openedition.org/moussons/3529 Accessed 19 Nov. 2018 and Malacca. Through trades with the Portuguese and other Europeans cultivation of non-native crops and ingredients quickly spread throughout Southeast Asia. Thailand being one of the entry points where the Europeans have traded and where the papaya was introduced to mainland Southeast Asia have led historian Sujit Wongthes, to speculate wrongly that the variant of tam som using papaya as the main ingredient probably originated in the communities of ethnic Chinese‚ÄìLao settlers living in the Chao Phraya plains of what is now Central Thailand‚Äîwhere it became known as som tam‚Äîduring the early Rattanakosin period (late 18th to early 19th centuries). The new dish, along with the papaya, then spread to today's Northeast Thailand (Isan) following the construction of the Northeastern railway line during the turn of the 19th‚Äì20th centuries, and became more popular after the opening of Mittraphap Road in 1957 helped bring new papaya cultivars into the region. The dish has since become widely adopted by the ethnic Lao people of both Isan and Laos. Likewise, the hot flavour also spread to Isan and Laos from Central Thailand, which had been introduced to chilli peppers first. However, earliest historical records show that by mid-1500s, the Europeans were already exploring and trading with mainland Southeast Asia reaching as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Laos. Some of the more notable Europeans who had travelled as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang or wrote extensively about their experiences were Fern√£o Mendes Pinto (1542-1545),Mendes Pinto, F. and Catz, R.

Print According to cultural anthropologist Penny Van Esterik, during the 50s and 60s, green papaya salad was rarely known among the Central Thais and could only be found where there are small gatherings of Lao or Northeasterners: > In the 1950s and 1960s glutinous rice, roast chicken, larb, somtam (papaya > salad), and other Lao favorites were available in Bangkok only around the > boxing stadium where northeastern boxers and fans gathered to eat and drink > before and after boxing matches.

With the opening of the Mittraphap Road and the northeastern railway connecting central Thailand to her northern provinces not only brought jobs and development to the region. It also created a gateway for one of Thailand's biggest inter-regional migration during the economic boom of the 1980s as demands for labour increased. It was estimated that between 1980-1990 approximately 1.1 million northeasterners had moved from the Northeast to central Thailand and Bangkok.Phongpaichit, Pasuk and Chris Baker. Thailand's boom. St Leonards: AlIen & Unwin; 1 996. This, in turn, helped popularize and create an unprecedented demand for Lao food outside of Laos and the Northeast.Kislenko, Arne. Culture and Customs of Laos. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2009. 117. Print. Van Esterik also noted that, \\"[i]n attempting to include northeastern food in a standardized national cuisine, middle-class Bangkok selected and modified the taste of a few dishes‚Äîgrilled chicken, somtam, larb‚Äîby reducing the chili peppers and increasing the sugar, and ignored other dishes such as fermented fish and insects.\\".Van Esterik, Penny (1992): From Marco Polo to McDonald's: Thai cuisine in transition, Food and Foodways: Explorations in the History and Culture of Human Nourishment, 5:2, 177-193 According professor Sirijit Sunantahttp://www.lc.mahidol.ac.th/en/People/Details.php?PERSONNELID=2551009 these dishes were then represented as \\"Thai food\\" when presented to the world.Sunanta, Sirijit. 2005. The globalization of Thai cuisine. Paper presented at the Canadian Council for Southeast Asian Studies Conference, York University, 14‚Äì16 October, in Toronto, Canada Preparation Unripe papaya is sliced into thin strips during preparation The dish combines the five main tastes of the local cuisine: sour lime, hot chili, salty, savory fish sauce, and sweetness added by palm sugar. The ingredients are mixed and pounded in a mortar. As the name tam som suggests, sourness is a dominant taste; however, the more specific Lao name tam maak hoong literally means \\"pounded papaya\\". In Khmer, the name bok l'hong also means \\"pounded papaya\\". In Thai, the name som tam is simply a reversal of the Lao name. However, other pounded salads in Thailand are consistent with the Lao naming convention in which the word tam (\\"pounded\\") is listed first. Despite the use of papaya, which one may think of as sweet, this salad is actually savory. When not yet ripe, papaya does not have a tangy flavor. The texture is crisp and firm, sometimes to the point of crunchiness. It is this that allows the fruit to withstand being beaten in the mortar. In Laos, green papaya salad is one of the traditional staples of the Lao. Pounded salads in Laos all fall under the parent category of tam som, which may or may not contain green papaya, however, when no specific type of tam som is mentioned, it is generally understood to refer to green papaya salad. For absolute clarity, however, the name tam maak hoong may be used, since this name means \\"pounded papaya\\". In Thailand, it is customary that a customer ask the preparer to make the dish suited to his or her tastes. To specifically refer to the original style of papaya salad as prepared in Laos or Isan, it is known as or som tam Lao or simply as tam Lao, and the dish as prepared in central Thailand may be referred to as som tam Thai. Traditionally, the local variety of green papaya salad in the streets of Bangkok is very hot due to the addition of a fistful of chopped hot bird's eye chili. However, with its rising popularity among tourists, it is now often served not as spicy as it used to be in the past. =Additional ingredients= Street vendor from Isan pounding green papaya salad in Bangkok Green papaya salad, grilled chicken and sticky rice is a popular combination in Laos and Thailand Together with the papaya, some or most of the following secondary items are added and pounded in the mortar with the pestle: *Asparagus beans *Brined \\"rice field crabs\\". These belong to the freshwater crab genera Sayamia, Chulathelphusa, and Esanthelphusa (previously classified as part of the genus Somanniathelphusa), which all belong to the Gecarcinucid crab subfamily Parathelphusinae.Ponchunchoovong, Samorn (2006).

It can also be eaten with fresh rice noodles (Lao: sen khao poon / Thai: khanom chin) or simply as a snack by itself with, for instance, crispy pork rinds. The dish is often accompanied by raw vegetables such as water spinach and white cabbage wedges on the side to mitigate the spiciness of the dish. Variations Green papaya salad is an innovation of the Lao people.Lee, Jonathan H. X., and Kathleen M. Nadeau. \\"Laotian Americans: Foods and Foodways.\\" Encyclopedia of Asian American folklore and folklife. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2011. 733. Print Variations of the dish are found throughout Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and as well as in the West, where it is more commonly known by its Thai name. A non-spicy green papaya salad version also exists in Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand, which is much sweeter; it often contains crushed peanuts, and is less likely to have padaek or brined crab. Dried brine shrimp are used in this Central Thai version. There are also versions that make use of unripe mangoes, apples, cucumbers, carrots, and other firm vegetables or unripe fruit. Besides using varieties of fruits or vegetables as the main ingredient a popular option is to use vermicelli rice noodle wherein the dish is known as tam sua. Instead of papaya, other ingredients can be used as the main ingredient. Popular variations in Laos and Thailand include: *Tam maak taeng / Tam taengkwa, with cucumber, usually the small variety *Tam maak muang / Tam mamuang, with green and unripe mango *Tam maak kuai / Tam kluai, with banana, while still green and unripe *Tam krathon, with santol, while still hard and unripe *Tam hua pli, with banana flower *Tam mayom, with Malay gooseberry *Tam som o, with pomelo *Tam mu yo, with mu yo sausage *Tam phonlamai ruam, with mixed fruit *Khao man som tam, with coconut rice Gallery File:Som tam thai.JPGSom tam Thai, which contains peanuts, is the Central Thai variant that became famous internationally File:Som tam pu.jpgSom tam pu, a green papaya salad with brined rice paddy crabs File:Tam phonla mai ruam.jpgTam phonlamai ruam: a variation of the dish with mixed fruit File:Somtam huapli832.jpgTam hua pli: a variation with banana flower File:Tam mu yo.jpgTam mu yo: a variation with mu yo sausage File:Tam mamuang pla haeng thot.jpgTam mamuang pla haeng thot: a variation with green mango and dried anchovies File:Tam maphrao on sen mi krop 02.jpgTam maphrao on sen mi krop: a variation with soft coconut meat and deep-fried rice noodle See also * List of fruit dishes *List of salads *Thai salads *Atchara * Tourism in Thailand References Further reading * Cummings, Joe.

Moldovan parliamentary election, 2005 At the 2005 parliamentary elections, on 6 March 2005, the party was part of the Democratic Moldova Electoral Bloc with the Democratic Party of Moldova (PDM) and Social Liberal Party (PSL), which won 28.4% of the popular vote and 34 out of 101 seats. After the elections the bloc fell apart in three parliamentary groups of the constituent parties, so the Alliance formed a separate group with 23 deputies until the 2009 elections, when they won fewer seats. Moldovan parliamentary election, 2009 At the April 2009 parliamentary elections, the Our Moldova Alliance won 11 seats. With the other opposition parties, it participated in the successful blocking of the election of a presidential candidate from the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) during the May‚ÄìJune 2009 presidential election, which led to new elections. At the July 2009 parliamentarty election, the Our Moldova Alliance lost 4 seats, receiving a total of 7 seats. However, other opposition parties gained enough seats for a majority and the PCRM was defeated. In August 2009, the party became a political force within the Alliance For European Integration.

Specifically, it is used for schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, tapeworm infections, cysticercosis, hydatid disease, and other fluke infections. It should not be used for worm infections of the eye. It is taken by mouth. Side effects may include poor coordination, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and allergic reactions. While it may be used during pregnancy, it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Praziquantel is in the anthelmintic class of medications. It works partly by affecting the function of the worm's sucker. Praziquantel was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Praziquantel is used to treat diseases caused by infection with several types of internal/gastrointestinal, and external parasites, including: * Hydatid disease caused by infection of various organs with larval stages of tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus * Cysticercosis caused by infection of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium (though it has been judged less effective than albendazole in treatment of neurocysticercosis) * In dogs and cats, whose gastrointestinal tracts are infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with pyrantel embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. Praziquantel is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis. * Schistosomiasis caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma: As of 2005, praziquantel is the primary treatment for human schistosomiasis, for which it is usually effective in a single dose. * Clonorchiasis brought on by the Chinese liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis * Paragonimiasis caused by infection with lung flukes, mostly of the species Paragonimus westermani * Fasciolopsiasis caused by intestinal fluke Fasciolopsis buski Side effects The majority of side effects develop due to the release of the contents of the parasites as they are killed and the consequent host immune reaction. The heavier the parasite burden, the heavier and more frequent the side effects normally are. * Central nervous system (CNS): Frequently occurring side effects are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, and vertigo have also been seen. Almost all patients with cerebral cysticercosis experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and meningism). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. All patients with cerebral cysticercosis are strongly recommended to be hospitalized during treatment. * Gastrointestinal tract: About 90% of all patients have abdominal pain or cramps with or without nausea and vomiting. Diarrhea may develop and may be severe with colic. Sweating, fever, and sometimes bloody stools may occur together with diarrhea. * Liver: Asymptomatic and transient increases of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are noted frequently (up to 27%). No case of symptomatic liver damage has been seen so far. * Sensitivity reactions: Urticaria, rash, pruritus and eosinophilia in white blood cell counts * Other locations/body as a whole: Lower back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, various cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension =Pregnancy= The WHO states praziquantel is safe during pregnancy. Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. Praziquantel is effective in reducing schistosomiasis during pregnancy. Another trial found that treatment with praziquantel did not increase the rates of low birthweight, fetal death, or congenital anomalies. Drug interactions The antibiotic rifampicin decreases plasma concentrations of praziquantel. Carbamazepine and phenytoin are reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Chloroquine also reduces its bioavailability. The drug cimetidine heightens praziquantel bioavailability. Mechanism of action The drug's mode of action is not exactly known at present, but experimental evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites' muscle, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites. Another hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action is that it interferes with adenosine uptake in worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the schistosome, as the Taenia and the Echinococcus (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize purines, such as adenosine, de novo. Bayer's Animal Health Division website states, \\"Praziquantel is active against cestodes (tapeworms). Praziquantel is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the bile. Upon entering the digestive tract from the bile, cestocidal activity is exhibited. Following exposure to praziquantel, the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the scolices (plural of \\"scolex\\"), are very rarely passed after administration of praziquantel. In many instances, only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms will be seen in the stool. The majority of tapeworms are digested and are not found in the feces.\\"http://bayer.naccvp.com/view_label.php Praziquantel is administered as a racemate, but only the (R)-enantiomer is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an amine obtained from praziquantel. Pharmacokinetics Praziquantel is well absorbed (about 80%) from the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, only a relatively small amount enters systemic circulation. Praziquantel has a serum half-life of 0.8 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal renal and liver function. Metabolites have a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. In patients with significantly impaired liver function (Child-Pugh score B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. Praziquantel and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. Praziquantel is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 pathway via CYP3A4. Agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 such as phenytoin, rifampin, and azole antifungals will affect the metabolism of praziquantel. Praziquantel has a particularly dramatic effect on patients with schistosomiasis. Studies of those treated have shown that within six months of receiving a dose of praziquantel, up to 90% of the damage done to internal organs due to schistosomiasis infection can be reversed. History Praziquantel was developed in the laboratories for parasitological research of Bayer AG and Merck KGaA in Germany (Elberfeld and Darmstadt) in the mid-1970s.

Leech made his first appearance in Uncanny X-Men as a Morlock, a group of mutants whose deformities force them to live in the sewers under Manhattan. He is usually depicted as being around twelve years old (his exact age is unrevealed). He speaks in broken English and refers to himself in the third person. Publication history Leech first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #179 (March 1984), and was created by Chris Claremont. Leech appeared as part of the \\"Morlocks\\" entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #9. Fictional character biography Leech in his original depiction with a more elongated skull. Art by John Romita, Jr. & Dan Green. The green-skinned Leech was orphaned as a toddler. His parents left him to die when his mutations became apparent. He was found by the Morlock Caliban and taken to a human-looking mutant woman named Annalee who raised him and several other young mutant orphans as her children. He made friends with X-Factor's ward named Artie Maddicks and had a few brief encounters with the X-Men. During the Mutant Massacre story arc, Mister Sinister rallies his henchmen, the Marauders, to infiltrate the sewers and massacre all the Morlocks living there in an effort to rid the world of \\"genetically impure\\" mutants. While many Morlocks are killed, Leech and Caliban survive, rescued by Power Pack and the X-Terminators (X-Factor in their role of mutant hunters). Leech joins Artie in the care of X-Factor until they could be enrolled in St. Simons, a private school that willingly accepts mutant children. Soon after they began attending this school, Leech and Artie are captured by mutant-hunting demons. Leech's technologically enhancing mutant friend, Taki Matsuya and an ad-hoc team of mutants, calling themselves the X-Terminators, join with the New Mutants in battling the demonic threat. They adventure through much of New York, witnessing much, such as innocent men being eaten, before the threat is contained.X-Terminators #1‚Äì4 (October 1988‚ÄìJanuary 1999) Leech, Artie, and Taki return to St. Simons, though they do not stay out of trouble. Taki's crush on a teacher leads to uncovering a plot by mutant-hating humans to kidnap and kill as many mutants as possible. The young trio disobey orders and literally fly off. After much violence, the kidnapping plans are discovered and the conspirators arrested.X-Force Annual #1 (1991) A nearby resident, Ida Fassbender, discovers the trio's technologically assisted jaunts, and her paranoia endangers their lives. She resolves the problem and unofficially becomes the boys' grandmother. Leech is comforted by Ida's resemblance to Annalee.New Mutants Annual #7 (1991) Another kidnapping plan works successfully and Artie and Leech are taken by the murderous mutant terrorists Gene Nation. This group was composed of second- generation Morlocks, the descendants of those who survived the massacre in the tunnels. They were born and raised in an alternate dimension with a faster flow of time than this one, called The Hill. They sought revenge for those who wronged their forebears. Gene Nation led a campaign to hunt down and kill as many humans as possible, since it was the humans' unwillingness to accept them that forced their parents into the tunnels in which they were massacred. Leech and Artie wanted no part of this, but were trapped until they were rescued by Generation X. They were thereafter made junior members.Generation X #5-7 =Generation X= Leech and Artie continued to live in the Massachusetts Academy under the care of Emma Frost and Sean Cassidy. They are later joined by Franklin Richards, who stays at the school while suffering from the loss of his family. Their friendship has unexpected benefits, as Leech is able to control Franklin's powers when they, aggravated by his grief, go out of control. The three visit the farm belonging to Hank McCoy's parents. Back at the Academy, they encounter Howard the Duck and other allies and as a group, are attacked by Black Tom Cassidy. Howard risks his life to save them all, then they are taken away by the Man-Thing. Leech and the rest have several adventures as the team called the Daydreamers.Daydreamers #1-3 (1997) When Richards' family, who had previously been exiled to an alternate universe (see Heroes Reborn), return, the group was disbanded. Leech and Artie go back to the academy and take on more active roles. Soon after, the school became bankrupt, and Emma and Sean were forced to open the school to human students. In order to keep Artie and Leech from being isolated, Emma gave them both an image inducer in the form of watches. The boys were quick to abuse this new technology, and were quickly set straight by Emma. Soon after, the school became exposed as a home for mutants, and Artie, Leech, and Penance were all sent away to protect them from any possible dangers that might arrive. =Weapon X= At some point, Leech is captured by the revived Weapon X program and was used by the Weapon X program to keep imprisoned mutants under control. When the program was about to be discovered, those responsible attempted to erase all information surrounding it by killing the prisoners. Leech survives and is one of the estimated 198 mutants who retained their powers after M-Day and moves to an encampment in the Xavier Institute.X-Men: The 198 #2 When an exploding supervillain causes the general public to turn on superheroes,Civil War #1‚Äì7 Domino, Shatterstar, and Caliban break out the 198 and take them to a bunker in the middle of the desert. They are sealed inside with nuclear weapons that are activated for self-detonation, but they are eventually freed from the bunker.X-Men: Civil War #1‚Äì4 Leech accompanies Caliban down to the old Morlock tunnels where they are attacked by an extremist group of Morlocks led by Masque, who after knocking out Caliban, kidnaps Leech because he needs Leech's powers. He is then rescued by the X-Men and Skids.Uncanny X-Men #487‚Äì491 Leech and Artie Maddicks were invited to Franklin Richards's birthday, and as a gift, Franklin invited them to live with the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #574 The two are now in a special class with intelligent moloids, Alex Power (Zero-G) of the Power Pack and other gifted kids.Fantastic Four #578 It is later revealed that Leech's cancelling powers were the reason that Reed Richards wanted him to be with Franklin.Fantastic Four #587 Leech later joins Reed's new Future Foundation superhero team. Powers and abilities Leech can dampen or completely suppress, neutralize, and negate for an undetermined amount of time the powers and abilities of any superpowered beings within 50 feet of him. His dampening ability in the beginning was involuntary and uncontrollable, but now his ability appears to be under his conscious control. Leech explained to Johnny Dee he could consciously bring his dampening field in close, so that persons are not dampened unless they touch him.X-Men: The 198 Leech has also been shown to dampen abilities that are non-mutant in origin at times, like the Fantastic Four, Hazmat of the Avengers Academy,Avengers Academy, #10 and during Marvel's Mutant Massacre crossover event, Leech negated the powers of the superhero team Power Pack, whose abilities were bestowed on them by an extraterrestrial.Power Pack, vol. 1 #12 & #27 In X-men the Animated Series, Leech was shown to possess telekinesis when he stole fruits from a fruit stand and moved humans that were in his way when trying to escape. When his ability has been targeted at mutants with super strength, at times his victims have become temporarily thin and frail. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= Leech is among the featured Morlocks that are survivors of Mister Sinister's experiments. =Ultimate Marvel= Leech was introduced to the Ultimate Marvel Universe in Ultimate X-Men #82 as a member of the Morlocks. He was never shown using his powers, so it is unclear as to whether or not they are the same. He looks similar, but more like an old man than a child. He was shot and killed by Sinister in issue #90.Ultimate X-Men #90 In other media =Television= * Leech appears in a few episodes of the X-Men Animated Series, voiced by John Stocker. In addition to his power-dampening ability, he displays telekinesis. His most notable appearance was in the Christmas episode \\"Have Yourself a Morlock Little Christmas\\" where he needed a blood transfusion from Wolverine, temporarily granting him Wolverine's healing ability in order to fight off a disease. * Leech appears in the X-Men: Evolution episode titled \\"Uprising\\" voiced by Danny McKinnon. In this series, his name was Dorian Leach, and he appeared fairly human with brown hair, only with pale, slightly greenish skin. His mutant ability releases an omni-directional pulse over an area at least the size of a city block. In addition to suppressing mutant abilities, it also nullifies all forms of energy, much like an electromagnetic pulse. The lasting effects are temporary, mostly fading after only one minute. In the episode, Leach's mother attempts to protect her son from being persecuted as a mutant, but is ultimately unsuccessful after a run-in with Spyke convinces him the boy is a mutant despite his mother's insistence otherwise. Following Leach's first use of his power to protect Spyke, Professor X approaches his mother with an offer for Leach to join his school when she feels that he is ready. He has a non-speaking role in the season finale, when Rogue absorbs his power/ability-neutralizing ability as part of a plan by Wolverine to beat Apocalypse. Her use of the ability in the fight demonstrates that it can be used to restore mutant abilities as well as negate them, as well as being able to direct the pulse as the ability's possessor sees fit. =Film= Kitty Pryde rescuing Leech as seen in X-Men: The Last Stand. * Leech appears in X-Men: The Last Stand, played by Cameron Bright. Leech (named Jimmy in the film, and code named Leech on a file handed to Beast) is a child, however, unlike the comics, he speaks normal English and has no outward physical mutations, but he does have an absence of hair. His power automatically cancels the mutation of any mutant that comes within an area of only a few feet around him, even including reversing physical mutations such as Hank McCoy's blue fur: when Hank reaches out to shake Jimmy's hand, his own hand loses its furry blue appearance; the mutation returns once he pulls it away. Leech plays a pivotal role in the film as the source of a newly-created \\"cure\\" for the mutant X-Gene, the cure being a sort of retroviral gene therapy using Leech's DNA, that permanently cancels the mutation of any mutant. Magneto plans to kill Leech, who is being kept at the cure-producing facility, set up in Alcatraz, thus destroying the cure's source (as at that point, they were still working on finding a way to synthesize the cure artificially) and effectively preserving the mutant species. Magneto and his newly expanded Brotherhood of Mutants attack the facility, which is defended by federal troops before they are joined by the X-Men. During the X-Men's fight against the Brotherhood, Juggernaut is sent in to kill Jimmy and Kitty Pryde races to save Jimmy from him. She reaches Leech before Juggernaut (who is also a mutant in the film), and defeats him by using Leech's nullification power against him, taunting him into charging right at them, and then moving them both out of his way as he comes close enough for his power to be canceled, causing him to knock himself out against a wall. Kitty and Jimmy then escape the building through the holes that Juggernaut smashed on his way in. Later, Jimmy is seen evacuating Alcatraz Island with the help of Pryde, and they receive further help from Bobby Drake. At the end of the film, Jimmy is seen as a member of the Xavier Institute with a full head of hair and is received by the new leader, Storm.

The show was based on the novel House Party (1954) by Patrick Dennis. It was ABC's attempt to turn female stand-up comic Phyllis Diller into a sitcom comedian very much in the style of Lucille Ball. The program starred Diller as Phyllis Pruitt, and featured Gypsy Rose Lee and Richard Deacon in supporting roles with Diller feeling the series was an inverted version of The Beverly Hillbillies. The show's producers originally sought comic actress Beatrice Lillie in the Diller role.The Curtain Will Rise Soon for 34 New Television Programs, published August 28, 1966, in the Reading Eagle, page 27; via Google News Archive Exteriors of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina were used as the locale. In 2002, TV Guide ranked it number 20 on its TV Guide's 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time list. Premise The Pruitts, a supposedly incredibly wealthy family living on Long Island in the Hamptons, have been approached by the Internal Revenue Service about overdue taxes. An audit revealed that the Pruitts were in fact broke. Rather than reveal this fact publicly and cause the economic depression which would presumably result, an improbably charitable IRS allowed them to continue living in their mansion and maintaining the pretensions of great wealth, which was difficult given their reduced circumstances. By mid-season, in order to raise more money, Phyllis Pruitt had opened the mansion to boarders, attracting a \\"nutty\\" collection of tenants as well, a group that included Paul Lynde as her hopeless brother, John Astin as her brother-in-law, and Marty Ingels as a handyman. In the premiere episode, Phyllis Pruitt unsuccessfully tries to roast a turkey in a front-loading washing machine.100 Favorite Moments in Television at scrubbles.net Development and history The show was created by executive producer David Levy, who also served in the same capacity on the ABC television series The Addams Family from 1964 to 1966. When ABC canceled that show in the spring of 1966, a few Addams Family alumni were recruited for the Diller series. Vic Mizzy, who composed the finger- snapping theme song to The Addams Family, composed the musical theme for Diller's show as well. According to Television magazine, The Pruitts of Southampton finished 77th among the 91 shows rated during the 1966‚Äì1967 season. It began the season airing on Tuesdays, opposite The Red Skelton Hour on CBS, which finished second in the ratings. On January 13, 1967, with the episode \\"Little Miss Fixit\\", the program changed its title to The Phyllis Diller Show. John Astin, who played Gomez Addams on The Addams Family, joined the cast the same month, and the show began airing on Fridays. In addition, the series marked a reunion for Astin and Marty Ingels who had starred in the 1962-1963 ABC-TV sitcom, I'm Dickens, He's Fenster. In the fall of 1968, NBC signed Diller to a weekly variety series hoping that the comedian would have the same kind of success that Carol Burnett had achieved for the rival network CBS. The program, entitled The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show, did poorly in ratings and was canceled after three months.

Farmer was born in Cardiff, Wales, the son of Seymour Farmer and Bessie Alexander Sander, and was educated there. He moved to Canada in 1900 and worked as a railway clerk. In 1910, he was Fred Dixon's campaign manager in the latter's unsuccessful bid for election to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. He became an accountant for the International Grain Company in 1913, and retained this position until 1927. Farmer married Lydia Gwendoline Ashton. Along with Dixon, Farmer opposed conscription during the First World War. During the Conscription Crisis of 1917, he was nominated by the Anti- Conscription League to contest the federal riding of Winnipeg Centre in the 1917 federal election; he resigned in favour of another labour candidate, however. Farmer supported the Winnipeg General Strike, and ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1919 and 1920. In December 1920, he was one of the founding members of Manitoba's Independent Labour Party. He considered running for the federal riding of Winnipeg Centre in the 1921 election, but withdrew in favour of J.S. Woodsworth. Farmer was elected mayor of Winnipeg in 1922 and 1923, although he could not command majority support from the city's councillors on either occasion. He was defeated by Ralph Webb in 1924, though he subsequently served as a councillor in 1928 and 1929, and again in the 1930s. Farmer was also elected to the provincial legislature for Winnipeg in the 1922 election, along with fellow ILP members Fred Dixon, John Queen and William Ivens. He was re-elected in the 1927 and 1932 elections, and replaced Queen as party leader in 1935. Farmer's early years as party leader were marked by conflict between the ILP and the newly formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. In 1933, the ILP agreed to affiliate with the CCF and support the latter party's skeletal network in the province. By 1936, the CCF had grown into a more powerful organization, and many ILP members were concerned about their autonomy. There were ideological differences between the two groups: the ILP was exclusively a labour party, whereas the CCF wanted to reach out to farmers as well. For the provincial election of 1936, the party campaigned under the \\"ILP-CCF\\" banner and increased their standing to seven seats. After the election, a group of disgruntled ILP members forced a temporarily disaffiliation from the CCF. Pressure from David Lewis and J.S. Woodsworth brought the two parties back in alignment, but their relationship remained tenuous. At the start of World War II, Farmer approved of J.S. Woodsworth's pacifist stance in the House of Commons of Canada and endorsed the CCF's call to conscript \\"wealth rather than men\\" for the war effort. Most in the ILP supported an all-out war effort, however, which further exacerbated tensions between the groups. The ILP finally dissolved in 1943, after its internal operations were taken over by CCF loyalists. Throughout the 1930s, Manitoba Premier John Bracken had attempted to bring the province's opposition parties into a \\"non-partisan\\" coalition government. Bracken's Progressives absorbed the provincial Liberals in 1932, but the other parties turned down his requests on two separate occasions. With the start of the war, however, \\"non- party\\" government became a more viable option. The Conservatives and Social Credit joined the government in 1940; despite opposition from David Lewis, Farmer was able to convince the CCF to do the same. Farmer argued (somewhat dubiously) that Bracken was willing to adopt labour-friendly policies, and that the CCF would benefit more from joining government than from being the sole group in opposition. He also argued that an all-party government would defer the next provincial election for a year, and allow the CCF more time to organize. Lewis eventually resigned himself to the alliance, and the CCF entered Manitoba's government in late 1940. Farmer became the first Single-Tax politician in Canada to receive a cabinet portfolio, being sworn in as Minister of Labour on 4 November. By any measurement, the CCF's tenure in government was a disaster for the party. While the Conservatives were fully integrated into the management of the province, Social Credit and the CCF were marginalized. Bracken forced Farmer's labour legislation to face free votes in the legislature; these soon took the form of party votes, with the CCF invariably on the losing side. The Manitoba CCF was demoralized in the election of 1941. Keeping an earlier pledge, it only contested ten ridings, and fell from seven to three members. Support for the CCF rose nationally throughout 1942, and there was a growing desire among many in the Manitoba party to leave the coalition. Farmer resigned from cabinet in December 1942, and the CCF formally left the government the following year. Farmer continued as party leader through the election of 1945. This campaign was a disappointment to the party‚Äîalthough it received more votes than the governing Liberal-Progressives (35% to 33%), it won only ten seats in the legislature. Farmer resigned as party leader in June 1947, and was replaced the following year by E.A. Hansford. Farmer did not contest the election of 1949. He died on January 16, 1951.

The concept of a link between creativity and mental illness has been extensively discussed and studied by psychologists and other researchers for centuries. Parallels can be drawn to connect creativity to major mental disorders including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, OCD and ADHD. For example, studies have demonstrated correlations between creative occupations and people living with mental illness. There are cases that support the idea that mental illness can aid in creativity, but it is also generally agreed that mental illness does not have to be present for creativity to exist.  History  It has been proposed that there is a particular link between creativity and mental illness (e.g. bipolar disorder, whereas major depressive disorder appears to be significantly more common among playwrights, novelists, biographers, and artists).Goodwin, F. and Jamison, K. R., Manic Depressive Illness, Oxford University Press (Oxford, 1990), p. 353. Association between mental illness and creativity first appeared in literature in the 1970s, but the idea of a link between \\"madness\\" and \\"genius\\" is much older, dating back at least to the time of Aristotle. In order to comprehend how the connection between ‚Äúmadness‚Äù and ‚Äúgenius‚Äù correlate, it is important to first understand that there are different types of geniuses: literary geniuses, creative geniuses, scholarly geniuses, and ‚Äúall around‚Äù geniuses. Since there are many different categories, this means that individuals can completely excel in one subject and know an average, or below average, amount of information about others.Kaufman, James C. \\"Two.\\" Creativity and Mental Illness. United Kingdom: Cambridge U House, 2014. 31‚Äì38. Print. The Ancient Greeks believed that creativity came from the gods, in particular the Muses (the mythical personifications of the arts and sciences, the nine daughters of Zeus). In the Aristotelian tradition, conversely, genius was viewed from a physiological standpoint, and it was believed that the same human quality was perhaps responsible for both extraordinary achievement and melancholy. Romantic writers had similar ideals, with Lord Byron having pleasantly expressed, \\"We of the craft are all crazy. Some are affected by gaiety, others by melancholy, but all are more or less touched\\". Individuals with mental illness are said to display a capacity to see the world in a novel and original way; literally, to see things that others cannot.Andreasen, N.C. (2011), \\"A journey into chaos: Creativity and the unconscious\\", Mens Sana Monographs, 9:1, p 42‚Äì53. Retrieved 2011-03-27  Studies  For many years, the creative arts have been used in therapy for those recovering from mental illness or addiction. Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesized that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity. Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). In Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament, Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo. A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives. A study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder. However, as a broader group, those in the creative professions (defined as \\"scientific and artistic occupations\\") were no more likely to experience psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports. Research in this area is usually constrained to cross-section data-sets. One of the few exceptions is an economic study of the well-being and creative output of three famous music composers over their entire lifetime. The emotional indicators are obtained from letters written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Liszt, and the results indicate that negative emotions had a causal impact on the creative production of the artists studied. Psychological stress has also been found to impede spontaneous creativity.The science of creativity A 2005 study at the Stanford University School of Medicine measured creativity by showing children figures of varying complexity and symmetry and asking whether they like or dislike them. The study showed for the first time that a sample of children who either have or are at high risk for bipolar disorder tend to dislike simple or symmetric symbols more. Children with bipolar parents who were not bipolar themselves also scored higher dislike scores.  Mood and creativity  Mood- creativity research reveals that people are most creative when they are in a positive mood and that mental illnesses such as depression or schizophrenia actually decrease creativity. People who have worked in the arts throughout history have dealt with poverty, persecution, social alienation, psychological trauma, substance abuse, high stressArnold M. Ludwig (1995) The Price of Greatness: Resolving the Creativity and Madness Controversy and other such environmental factors which are associated with developing and perhaps causing mental illness. It is thus likely that when creativity itself is associated with positive moods, happiness, and mental health, pursuing a career in the arts may bring problems with stressful environment and income. Other factors such as the centuries-old stereotype of the suffering of a \\"mad artist\\" help to fuel the link by putting expectations on how an artist should act, or possibly making the field more attractive to those with mental illness. Additionally, where specific areas of the brain are less developed than others by nature or external influence, the spatial capacity to expand another increases beyond \\"the norm\\" allowing enhanced growth and development.  Bipolar disorder  Bipolar disorder is one of the main mental disorders said to inspire creativity, as the manic episodes are typically characterised by prolonged and elevated periods of energy. In her book Touched with Fire, American clinical psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison wrote that 38% of writers and poets had been treated for a type of mood disorder, and virtually all creative writers and artists (89%) had experienced \\"intense, highly productive, and creative episodes\\". These were characterised by \\"pronounced increases in enthusiasm, energy, self-confidence, speed of mental association, fluency of thought and elevated mood\\". Although mania is characterized by reckless and possibly self-destructive behavior, in milder forms, the energy and free-flowing thinking of mania can fuel creativity. There is a range of types of bipolar disorder. Individuals with Bipolar I Disorder experience severe episodes of mania and depression with periods of wellness between episodes. The severity of the manic episodes can mean that the person is seriously disabled and unable to express the heightened perceptions and flight of thoughts and ideas in a practical way. Individuals with Bipolar II Disorder experience milder periods of hypomania during which the flight of ideas, faster thought processes and ability to take in more information can be converted to art, poetry or design.Parker, G., (ed.) \\"Bipolar II Disorder: modeling, measuring and managing\\", Cambridge University Press (Cambridge,2005). Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh is widely theorised to have suffered from bipolar disorder. Other notable creative people with bipolar disorder include Carrie Fisher, Demi Lovato, Kanye West, Stephen Fry (who suffers from cyclothymia, a milder and more chronic form of bipolar), Mariah Carey, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ronald Braunstein, and Patty Duke.  Schizophrenia  People with schizophrenia live with positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms (psychotic behaviors that are not present in healthy people) include hallucinations, delusions, and thought and movement disorders. Negative symptoms (abnormal functioning of emotions and behavior) include \\"flat affect\\", anhedonia, reserved. Cognitive symptoms include problems with \\"executive functioning\\", attention, and memory. One artist known for his schizophrenia was the Frenchman Antonin Artaud, founder of the Theatre of Cruelty movement. In Madness and Modernism (1992), clinical psychologist Louis A. Sass noted that many common traits of schizophrenia ‚Äì especially fragmentation, defiance of authority, and multiple viewpoints ‚Äì happen to also be defining features of modern art.  Arguments that support link  In a 2002 conversation with Christopher Langan, educational psychologist Arthur Jensen stated that the relationship between creativity and mental disorder \\"has been well researched and is proven to be a fact\\", writing that schizothymic characteristics are somewhat more frequent in philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists than in the general population. In a 2015 study, Iceland scientists found that people in creative professions are 25% more likely to have gene variants that increase the risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, with deCODE Genetics co-founder K√°ri Stef√°nsson saying, \\"Often, when people are creating something new, they end up straddling between sanity and insanity. I think these results support the concept of the mad genius.\\" = Bipolar disorder = Many famous historical figures gifted with creative talents may have been affected by bipolar disorder. Ludwig van Beethoven, Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Isaac Newton, Judy Garland, Jaco Pastorius and Robert Schumann are some people whose lives have been researched to discover signs of mood disorder.Goodnick, P.J. (ed.) Mania: clinical and research perspectives. American Psychiatric Press, Washington, 1998. In many instances, creativity and mania - the overwhelming highs that bipolar individuals often experience - share some common traits, such as a tendency for \\"thinking outside the box,\\" flights of ideas, the speeding up of thoughts and heightened perception of visual, auditory and somatic stimuli. It has been found that the brains of creative people are more open to environmental stimuli due to smaller amounts of latent inhibition, an individual's unconscious capacity to ignore unimportant stimuli. While the absence of this ability is associated with psychosis, it has also been found to contribute to original thinking. = Emotions = Many people with bipolar disorder may feel powerful emotions during both depressive and manic phases, potentially aiding in creativity.Are Genius and Madness Related? Contemporary Answers to an Ancient Question  Psychiatric Times Because (hypo)mania decreases social inhibition, performers are often daring and bold. As a consequence, creators commonly exhibit characteristics often associated with mental illness. The frequency and intensity of these symptoms appear to vary according to the magnitude and domain of creative achievement. At the same time, these symptoms are not equivalent to the full-blown psychopathology of a clinical manic episode which, by definition, entails significant impairment. = Posthumous diagnosis = Some creative people have been posthumously diagnosed as experiencing bipolar or unipolar disorder based on biographies, letters, correspondence, contemporaneous accounts, or other anecdotal material, most notably in Kay Redfield Jamison's book Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament. Touched with Fire presents the argument that bipolar disorder, and affective disorders more generally,Jamison, K. R., Touched with Fire, Free Press (New York, 1993), pp 82 ff. may be found in a disproportionate number of people in creative professions such as actors, artists, comedians, musicians, authors, performers and poets. Scholars have also speculated that the visual artist Michelangelo lived with depression. In the book Famous Depressives: Ten Historical Sketches, MJ Van Lieburg argues that elements of depression are prominent in some of Michelangelo's sculptures and poetry. Van Lieburg also draws additional support from Michelangelo's letters to his father in which he states: \\"I lead a miserable existence and reck not of life nor honour - that is of this world; I live wearied by stupendous labours and beset by a thousand anxieties. And thus I lived for some fifteen years now and never an hour's happiness have I had.\\" = Positive correlation = Several recent clinical studies have also suggested that there is a positive correlation between creativity and bipolar disorder, although the relationship between the two is unclear. Temperament may be an intervening variable. Ambition has also been identified as being linked to creative output in people across the bipolar spectrum. = Mental illness and divergent thinking = In 2017, associate professor of psychiatry Gail Saltz stated that the increased production of divergent thoughts in people with mild-to-moderate mental illnesses leads to greater creative capacities. Saltz argued that the \\"wavering attention and day-dreamy state\\" of ADHD, for example, \\"is also a source of highly original thinking. [...] CEOs of companies such as Ikea and Jetblue have ADHD. Their creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, high energy levels, and disinhibited manner could all be a positive result of their negative affliction.\\" Mania has also been credited with aiding in creativity because \\"when speed of thinking increases, word associations form more freely, as do flight of ideas, because the manic mind is less inclined to filtering details that, in a normal state, would be dismissed as irrelevant.\\"  Arguments against a link  Albert Rothenberg of Psychology Today noted that the \\"list of mentally ill creators who were successful [...] is dwarfed by the very large number of highly creative people both in modern times and throughout history without evidence of disorder\\", which includes figures such as William Shakespeare, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Jane Austen. Rothenberg reported that when interviewing 45 science Nobel laureates for the book Flight from Wonder he had found no evidence of mental illness in any of them, and also stated, \\"The problem is that the criteria for being creative is never anything very creative. Belonging to an artistic society, or working in art or literature, does not prove a person is creative. But the fact is that many people who have mental illness do try to work in jobs that have to do with art and literature, not because they are good at it, but because they're attracted to it. And that can skew the data.\\"  Notable individuals  * Joanne Greenberg's novel I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1964) is an autobiographical account of her teenage years in Chestnut Lodge working with Dr. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann. At the time she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, although two psychiatrists who examined Greenberg's self-description in the book in 1981 concluded that she did not have schizophrenia, but had extreme depression and somatization disorder. The narrative constantly puts difference between the protagonist's mental illness and her artistic ability. Greenberg is adamant that her creative skills flourished in spite of, not because of, her condition.\\"I wrote [I Never Promised You a Rose Garden] as a way of describing mental illness without the romanticisation [sic] that it underwent in the sixties and seventies when people were taking LSD to simulate what they thought was a liberating experience. During those days, people often confused creativity with insanity. There is no creativity in madness; madness is the opposite of creativity, although people may be creative in spite of being mentally ill.\\" This statement from Greenberg originally appeared on the page for Rose Garden at amazon.com and has been quoted in many places including Asylum: A Mid-Century Madhouse and Its Lessons About Our Mentally Ill Today, by Enoch Callaway, M.D. (Praeger, 2007), p. 82. * Brian Wilson (born 1942), founder of the American rock band the Beach Boys, suffers from schizoaffective disorder. In 2002, after undergoing treatment, he spoke of how medication affects his creativity, explaining: \\"I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I think I need the demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't seem to find a melody.\\" * Daniel Johnston (1961-2019) was an outsider musician sometimes celebrated as \\"the Brian Wilson of lo-fi\\". His music is often attributed to his psychological issues. In a press release issued by his manager, it was requested that reporters refrain from describing Johnston as a \\"genius\\" due to the musician's emotional instabilities. The Guardians David McNamee argued that \\"it's almost taboo to say anything critical about Johnston. This is incredibly patronising. For one thing, it makes any honest evaluation of his work impossible.\\" * Terry A. Davis (1969‚Äì2018) was a computer programmer who created and designed an entire operating system, TempleOS, alongside full 2D and 3D graphics libraries, a programming language (HolyC) and a compiler all by himself. Although his remarks were often incomprehensible or abrasive, he was known to be exceptionally lucid if the topic of discussion was computers. He refused medication for his schizophrenia because he believed it limited his creativity. In 2017, the OS was shown as a part of an outsider art exhibition in Bourgogne, France. * Kanye West (born 1977) is an American rapper, singer record producer, and fashion designer who suffers from bipolar disorder. The creativity in his art and his outspoken views on different topics are sometimes attributed in part to him suffering from bipolar disorder. West has said this on his bipolar disorder, \\"I can just tell you what I'm feeling at the time, and I feel a heightened connection with the universe when I'm ramping up. It is a health issue. This ‚Äî it's like a sprained brain, like having a sprained ankle. And if someone has a sprained ankle, you're not going to push on him more. With us, once our brain gets to a point of spraining, people do everything to make it worse.\\"  See also  *Savant syndrome *Tortured artist  References   External links  * The 'Sylvia Plath' effect by Deborah Smith Bailey from American Psychological Association * The Myth of the Mentally Ill Creative blog entry about creativity and mental illness by a professor of psychology and creativity scientist Keith Sawyer * A journey into chaos: Creativity and the unconscious by Nancy C Andreasen, Mens Sana Monographs, 2011, 9(1), p 42‚Äì53.

Publishers Weekly listed The Dark Half as the second best-selling book of 1989 behind Tom Clancy's Clear and Present Danger. The novel was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 1993. Stephen King wrote several books under a pseudonym, Richard Bachman, during the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the Bachman novels were darker and more cynical in nature, featuring a far more visceral sense of horror than the psychological, gothic style common in many of King's most famous works. When King was identified as Bachman, he wrote The Dark Half ‚Äì about an author with a sinister parasitic twin ‚Äì in response to his outing. The book's central villain, George Stark, was named in honor of Richard Stark, the pen name of writer Donald E. Westlake under which he wrote some of his darkest, most violent books. King telephoned Westlake personally to ask permission. King's own \\"Richard Bachman\\" pseudonym was also partly named for Stark: King had been reading a Richard Stark novel at the time he chose the pen name. Plot summary Thad Beaumont is an author and recovering alcoholic who lives in the town of Ludlow, Maine. Thad's own books ‚Äì cerebral literary fiction ‚Äì are not very successful. However, under the pen name \\"George Stark\\", he writes highly successful crime novels about a violent killer named Alexis Machine. When Thad's authorship of Stark's novels becomes public knowledge, Thad and his wife, Elizabeth, decide to stage a mock burial for his alter ego at the local cemetery, which is featured in a People magazine article. Stark's epitaph says it all: \\"Not A Very Nice Guy.\\" Stark, however, emerges from the mock grave as a physical entity, complete with the personality traits that Thad exhibited while writing as Stark, such as drinking heavily and smoking Pall Mall cigarettes. He then goes on a killing spree, gruesomely murdering everyone he perceives as responsible for his \\"death\\" ‚Äì Thad's editor, agent, and the People interviewer, among others. Thad, meanwhile, is plagued by surreal nightmares. Stark's murders are investigated by Alan Pangborn, the sheriff of the neighboring town of Castle Rock, who finds Thad's voice and fingerprints at the crime scenes. This evidence, and Thad's unwillingness to answer his questions, causes Pangborn to believe that Thad ‚Äì despite having alibis ‚Äì is responsible for the murders. Later, it's discovered that Stark has the same fingerprints as Thad, a clue to the twinship he and Thad share. Thad eventually discovers that both he and Stark share a mental bond, and begins to find notes from Stark written in his own handwriting. The notes tell Thad what activity Stark has been engaging in. Observing his son and daughter, Thad notes that twins share a unique bond. They can feel each other's pain and at times appear to read the other's mind. Using this as a key to his own situation, he begins to discover the even deeper meaning behind himself and Stark. Pangborn eventually learns that Thad had an unborn twin brother who was absorbed into Thad in utero and later removed from his brain when the author was a child. He had suffered from severe headaches and it was originally thought to be a tumor causing them. The neurosurgeon who removed it found the following inside: part of a nostril, some fingernails, some teeth, and a malformed human eye. This leads to questions about the true nature of Stark, whether he is a malevolent spirit with its own existence, or Thad himself, manifesting an alternate personality. Thad eventually destroys Stark, but the book ends on an unhappy note with Thad's wife having serious doubts about the future of their relationship: she is appalled that Thad not only created Stark (if unintentionally), but that a part of him liked Stark. Adaptations The novel was adapted as a film, The Dark Half, by George A. Romero in 1990, and was released in 1993. It was filmed in part at Washington and Jefferson College and other locations in southwestern Pennsylvania. It starred Timothy Hutton as Thad/Stark, Michael Rooker as Alan Pangborn, and featured Julie Harris as an eccentric colleague of Thad's who provides some vital information about the supernatural. An adventure video game adaptation was released for DOS in 1992. It was developed by Symtus and published by Capstone Software. In December 2019, it was announced that MGM would develop a film adaptation of the novel, with Alex Ross Perry set to write and direct.

Aurea was an Italian automobile manufactured in Turin from 1921 to 1930. History Aurea built sidevalve and overhead valve four-cylinder cars with engines that started at 1460 cc in the S.V. version engine, but later were increased to 1479 cc in both S.V. and O.H.V. engine configurations. Only the \\"S\\" type MONZA factory racing version contained the OHV type engine. The cars were well-made, but fairly heavy. Regular production of Aureas stopped around 1926, but the company produced a few more cars from existing parts and maintained parts supply under for the vehicles under Ceirano's new ownership and management from late 1926 onwards.Post last Aurea vehicle assembly, the same factory was used to manufacture Ceirano commercial vehicles, particularly trucks. Cars Three model series of the Aurea were produced: # Series 400 model - 1920 to 1922 production; No \\"S\\" versions, 5 passenger body styles; 1460cc engine, rear wheel brakes only, wooden artillery type wheels. # Series 500 model - 1923 to mid-1925, \\"S\\" type OHV introduced as top line model - 4 wheel brakes and wire wheels; all other passenger models have 2 wheel brakes and wooden artillery wheels and are rear wheel brake only. # Series 600 model - mid-1925 to late 1926 - Body style changes to increase width of passenger compartment; radiator badge contains abbreviation \\"FATA\\" re: Fascist era of production (early Aurea's do not contain this). \\"S\\" OHV version still in production. FATA is \\"Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili\\". Wire wheels on Aurea are \\"clinker\\" or \\"B.E.\\" type rims of French Michelin origin at 18 inches diameter and are identical to that of the FIAT 509 model (some FIAT's have \\"Dunlop\\" brand as similar). Brake front end type is very similar to that of the \\"Amilcar\\". All Aurea front I beam axles contain a casting of the Aurea radiator badge insignia at front centre (between I beam top and bottom web). Aurea radiators are German Silver construction and contain a rare French \\"Gallay\\" core identical to that of the Silver Ghost Rolls Royce; The radiator cap is bakelite and brass and identical to that of early 20s vintage FIAT cars (501,503,505,509 & 510 models). Aurea Factory site is located in Turin close to FIAT. The factory survived from 1926 to World War II under Ceirano management producing Aurea spares and Ceirano Commercial vehicles (not cars). The factory was bombed and destroyed around 1941 according to Italian Historians. Of those examples surviving: Series 400 - 1 remnant vehicle in Australia, NSW; One ex Australian vehicle now being driven in UK. Series 500 - 1 only low mileage original vehicle located in Northern Italy. Series 600 - 1 only example, running and complete with Australian (Wagga based) body, in Melbourne Australia. It is believed a second and original British bodied Aurea survives in England, but has not been seen or heard of for at 25 years (per this year 2008 comment). 6 vehicles are confirmed as arriving in Australia at Parammatta Agency (confirmed by son of ex Aurea garage mechanic from that establishment, located in Parramatta Road) - At least two OHV versions; 1 off discarded car burnt out in bushfire blaze in the early 1970s S.W. of Sydney; remanats of second OHV car found at Dandenong, Melbourne in the late 1950s, same vehicle's engine found at Ballarat Victoria in the early 1980s; 1 only Series 600 arrived, bodied at coachbuilder Wagga Wagga N.S.W in 1926, moved to Harrietville VIC. in 1929 and survived there until the late 1950s and known as the \\"Roarer Farter\\" after radiator badge wording \\"Aurea FATA\\"; This vehicle resided at Bright VIC. until the early 1990s; At least 2 series 400 arrived, one residing at Hawthorn Melbourne for many years before residing in Ballarat VIC during the late 1970s through 1980s; At least one Series 500 (standard car)arrived in Australia, it was raced by the Parammatta Aurea Mechanic (in standard form) in the first, and several successive Warrick Farm (Sydney)raceway events. Only two Australian new-sales agencies were known - 1 at Parramatta Rd. Parramatta Sydney and 1 in Wagga Wagga, N.S.W. No known agencies existed in Melbourne or any other Australian State. Aureas were only exported ex Italy to England, Austria and Australia. Italian vehicles received Italian made bodies; Australian bound vehicles were exported via England and contain either a British made body or Australian made body. All Aurea have a typical \\"gable\\" type bonnet and scuttle arrangement similar to the late 1920s FIAT and all Ceirano, Lancia and other Italian makes of that period. The Aurea 1460 and 1490 cc S.V. engine is similar to that of a FIAT 501 design, but is unique. Aurea engine and drivetrain components can only be identified by a cast oval containing the word \\"Aurea\\" at top centre of gearbox bellhousing, as per Ceirano vehicle arrangement. Aurea use American 6 Volt Westinghouse starting and generating systems. generator is mounted in gearbox and similar to the Metallurgique car arrangement. Aurea vehicles contain Veglia instruments from the Veglia family of Bologna Italy; later versions contain O.S. instruments as a variation of the Veglia standard type. Amp gauge is American Westinghouse and oil gauge is \\"Aurea\\" insignia marked. All Aurea vehicles are right hand drive formation, as this was law in Italy before that countries road laws changed; hence they were suitable for British and Colonial use. Series 400 Aureas contain a 3 speed gearbox; Series 500 and 600 vehicles contain a 4 speed gearbox with a central mounted gear change gate and a reverse \\"block - out\\" button located in centre of gear knob. Top speed of the later 500 and 600 series models in standard production form is @ 40 miles per hour. The OHV \\"S\\" versions typically have two-seater aluminium bodies and an extra 15 to 20 mile per hour top speed and much better stopping capability. The steering box of Aurea are virtually identical to the FIAT 501 model but do not contain the characteristic FIAT throttle arrangement. Aurea vehicles have a throttle knob located longitudinally parallel to the steering column rod and protrude through toe board plate. Aurea contain a \\"carden-shaft\\" rear end similar to FIAT design. Cooling systems are of the thermosyphon type with no water pump. The carburettor is of the sidedraft type SOLEX design and are a rarer 28 mm SOLEX throat diameter. Four cold-start priming caps reside in-head for winter starting. Battery location is underfloor for non-Italian vehicles and running board mounted (in-box) otherwise. Magneto is the Marelli brand, located on vehicles passenger side and reverse rotation to that of FIAT 501. Interior body trim on all vehicles is of a very high standard for the vehicles market segment; In-general the vehicles were aimed at the middle-car market and appealed aesthetically with \\"higher than average\\" upholstery quality and internal fitting appointments. The steering wheel of an Aurea is exactly that of the Lancia Lambda and is moulded in \\"Shellanite\\" (Shell brand bakelite). English and Australian passenger compartment body styling resembles that of the English \\"Clyno\\" car, but is approximately the same dimensions as the larger FIAT 501 vehicle. Series 400 and 600 Aurea vehicles contain single bulb headlight arrangements similar in style to that of German \\"Bosch\\" brand shape, and contain the cast word \\"Aurea\\" at the top front of the headlights cast aluminium bezel. Series 600 vehicles contain a rarer twin bulb headlight, similar to Bosch Lancia Lambda style, but are of the Italian \\"Carello\\" brand and are all-brass with a unique Carello headlight glass. The taillight assembly is a cylindrical type and similar, but not the same as FIAT vehicles. British taillights are rectangular and \\"jeweled\\", being similar to that of the English \\"Clyno\\" Car. Competition An original OHV Aurea factory team racing car survives located in Sicily - This vehicle has MONZA factory racing origin. These vehicles raced at MONZA competitively for 1 or 2 years reliably but unsuccessfully in their vehicle class.

It broadcasts a full-time country music format (with classic country and Americana leanings, the latter of which is branded as \\"Route 650\\") at 650 kHz and is known primarily as the home of The Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest running radio program.Gevinson, Alan. \\"Broadcasting Longevity.\\" Teachinghistory.org, accessed 8 October 2011. The station's clear channel signal can reach much of North America and nearby countries, especially late at night. It is one of two clear-channel stations in North America, along with CFZM in Toronto, that still primarily broadcast music; as recently as 2020, the station was live and locally originated during the overnight hours, but the overnight host position was eliminated in February 2020. Nicknamed \\"The Air Castle of the South,\\" it shares its callsign with WSM-FM, also in Nashville, and formerly with television Channel 4, now WSMV. Heritage WSM's transmitter facility and Blaw-Knox tower, located just south of Nashville along Interstate 65 in Brentwood, Tennessee Founded by the National Life and Accident Insurance Company, WSM first signed on October 5, 1925.\\"WSM ‚Äì Since 1925\\", WSM. Retrieved August 26, 2018.Havighurst, Craig. Air Castle of the South: WSM and the Making of Music City (University of Illinois Press, 2011). It is primarily associated with the popularization of country music through its weekly Saturday night program, the Grand Ole Opry, the longest-running radio program in history. The Opry began as the WSM Barn Dance on November 28, 1925, with Uncle Jimmy Thompson as the first performer.History of the Opry, Grand Ole Opry. Retrieved August 26, 2018. On December 10, 1927, the program's host, \\"Judge\\" George D. Hay, referred to the programming as being \\"Grand Ole Opry\\" in contrast to the preceding grand opera program on NBC.Phillips, Stephen W. (2016). Opryland USA. Arcadia Publishing. p. 13. Retrieved August 26, 2018. In 1932, WSM boosted its power to 50,000 watts, becoming Tennessee's first clear-channel station. In addition to its vast nighttime coverage area, the station boasts one of the largest daytime coverage areas in the country. It provides at least grade B coverage as far southeast as Chattanooga, as far northwest as Evansville, Indiana, as far west as Jackson, Tennessee and as far south as Huntsville, Alabama. At night, it can be heard in much of the eastern and central United States. The station traditionally played country music in the nighttime hours, when listeners from around the United States would tune in. During daytime hours, the station broadcast long-form radio, including both local and NBC network programs, in addition to music. After television became popular (thus largely eliminating the audience for full-length radio programs), WSM adopted a \\"MOR\\" (middle of the road) music format during the daytime hours, and continued to play country music at night. It was not until 1980 that WSM adopted the 24-hour country music format of today. WSM is credited with helping shape Nashville into a recording industry capital. Because of WSM's wide reach, musical acts from all across the eastern United States came to Nashville in the early decades of the station's existence, in hopes of getting to perform on WSM. Over time, as more acts and recording companies came to Nashville, the city became known as the center of the country music industry. Disc jockey David Cobb is credited with first referring to Nashville as \\"Music City USA\\", a designation that has since been adopted as the city's official nickname by the local tourism board. In 1996, the station was named Radio Station of the Year at the International Bluegrass Music Awards.\\"Bluegrass Rumblings and Awards\\".

It is located near the I-65 exit 71 interchange with Concord Road (State Highway 253). When the 878-foot tower was built in 1932, it was the tallest antenna in North America. Its height was reduced to 808 feet (246 m) in 1939 when it was discovered that the taller tower was causing self- cancellation in the \\"fringe\\" areas of reception of the station (it is now known that 195 electrical degrees, about 810 feet, is the optimum height for a Class A station on that frequency). For a period during World War II it was designated to provide transmissions to submarines in the event that ship-to- shore communications were lost. It is now one of the oldest operating broadcast towers in the United States.WSM tower gets 'historic' status, The Tennessean, April 14, 2011 As a tribute to the station's centrality in country music history, the diamond antenna design was incorporated into the new Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum's design in 2001. The tower is listed as a National Engineering Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 2011. Former sister stations In 1939, WSM began operating an experimental high-frequency, high-fidelity AM \\"Apex\\" station, W4XA, on 26,150 kHz.\\"Formal Opening\\" (advertisement), Nashville Tennessean, April 9, 1939, page A-5. The \\"4\\" in W4XA's call sign indicated that it was located in the 4th radio district, while the \\"X\\" reflected its operation as an experimental station. This was replaced in 1941 by a commercial FM station, initially with the call sign W47NV and operating on 44.7 MHz. This was reported to be first commercial FM to be fully licensed; although a few FM stations had begun broadcasting earlier, they were operating under experimental or \\"Special Temporary Authorizations\\" and had not yet been granted operating licenses.\\"FCC Authorization For 53 Commercial FM Outlets Given\\", Broadcasting, August 18, 1941, page 54. The initial policy for commercial FM station call signs included an initial \\"W\\" for stations located east of the Mississippi River, followed by the last two digits of a station's frequency assignment, \\"47\\" in this case, and closing with a one or two character city identifier, which for Nashville stations was \\"NV\\".\\"Really the First\\", Broadcasting, March 24, 1941, page 39. In 1943 the call sign was changed to WSM-FM, however the station was shut down in 1951, although its antenna is still mounted atop the Blaw Knox tower at Brentwood. Seventeen years later the current incarnation of WSM-FM was established after a National Life subsidiary purchased WLWM and renamed it WSM-FM in 1968. This WSM-FM (95.5 MHz) was WSM's sister until 2008, when Cumulus Media, the full owner of WSM-FM since 2003, ended its joint sales agreement with the AM (see below). Despite having the same base call sign, the two stations are no longer related; incidentally, both the current WSM-FM on 95.5 MHz and the current occupant of the 103.3 frequency vacated by the original WSM-FM, WKDF, are now sister stations, with each broadcasting variants of the Nash FM format. Ownership and facilities For most of its history, WSM was owned by the Nashville-based National Life and Accident Insurance Company, along with WSM- TV, and the Grand Ole Opry. The stations' call letters derived from the company's motto, We Shield Millions. Studios were first located in the NL&AI; building on Seventh Avenue and Union Street in downtown Nashville; this was the original home of the Opry, until 1934. The studios remained until the mid-1960s, when NL&AI; began carrying out plans to build a new headquarters building downtown and construct new studios for WSM-TV in west Nashville (the TV station had been located near Belmont College). Upon construction of the new headquarters, NL&AI; chose to relocate WSM radio to the TV station's building, and the station, joined in 1968 by its new FM sister, broadcast from that location, on Knob Road, from 1966 to 1983. In 1974, NL&AI; reorganized itself as a holding company, NLT Corporation, with the WSM stations as one of the major subsidiaries. In 1981, the American General Corporation (now part of the American International Group) bought NLT. At one time, American General was the parent company of the Life and Casualty Insurance Company based in Nashville, former owner of WSM-TV rival WLAC-TV (now WTVF), and WLAC AM and FM, but divested the broadcast properties in 1975, long before the NLT merger. American General was not interested in NLT's non-insurance operations, and sold Opryland Hotel, Opryland USA, The Grand Ole Opry, WSM-FM, and WSM, to Gaylord Entertainment Company. WSM-TV was sold to Gillett Broadcasting and is now WSMV. However, there was still considerable overlap between the stations' on-air personnel for some years after the ownership change. Gaylord would add The Nashville Network (later the National Network and Spike TV), now the Paramount Network, to those holdings soon after those acquisitions, disposing of the television property, in part to pay the expenses of starting the nascent cable network. It would also move the WSM radio stations to new facilities at the Opryland Hotel, departing their shared building on Knob Road, which still houses WSMV today. WSM broadcast in the C-QUAM format of AM stereo, which could be heard over several states at night, from 1982 until 2000. WSM's \\"fishbowl\\" studio inside the Gaylord Opryland hotel WSM currently operates out of the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, and visitors to the hotel may look into the studio 24 hours a day, provided the curtains are open, which they usually are. Following the devastating 2010 Tennessee flood that inundated Gaylord Opryland and the Grand Ole Opry House, the station broadcast from a makeshift studio at its transmitter site for six months, while the Grand Ole Opry rotated between several performance sites, until the buildings at the Opryland complex were repaired. WSM's administrative offices next door to the Grand Ole Opry House were completely destroyed by the flood and later demolished, resulting in the loss of several priceless documents from the station's history. In 2001, management had sought to capitalize on the success of sister station WWTN's sports trappings by converting WSM to an all-sports format. Word was leaked to other media resulting in protests, including longtime Opry personalities and country music singers, outside the station's studios. Management eventually made the decision to keep the station's classic country format. In recent years, the operations have been reorganized again. In 2003, WSM-FM and WWTN, sister stations to WSM, were sold to Cumulus Media. Cumulus intended to purchase WSM as well, but Gaylord decided to maintain ownership at the eleventh hour. Through a five-year joint sales agreement, however, Gaylord paid Cumulus a fee to operate WSM's sales department and provide news updates for the station. Gaylord Entertainment continued to control WSM and operate all other departments, including programming, engineering, and promotions. The agreement ended in 2008, at which point all control of the station reverted to Gaylord. In 2012, Gaylord Entertainment Company was renamed Ryman Hospitality Properties. Reception outside the Nashville area From 2002 until 2006, the station was a choice on Sirius Satellite Radio, which carried a full-time simulcast of WSM's signal, except during NASCAR races. Briefly in 2006, the channel converted to \\"WSM Entertainment\\", a separate satellite radio feed that carried the same classic country music format as the AM signal. About a year after the channel was eliminated, then-rival XM Satellite Radio announced the carriage of the Grand Ole Opry on Nashville! channel 11 beginning in October 2007, as well as the Eddie Stubbs Show on America channel 10 beginning in November 2007. After the merger between Sirius and XM, the Grand Ole Opry broadcasts were moved to the service's The Roadhouse channel, which is heard on both Sirius and XM. WSM continues to reach a worldwide audience, through both its powerful 50,000-watt clear channel AM signal and via its Internet simulcast. WSM is a Primary Entry Point (PEP) for the Emergency Alert System (EAS). Internet channels =Route 650= In 2017, WSM launched Route 650, a full-time Americana music streaming station available via its website, mobile app and services like TuneIn. =Opry Nashville Radio= In 2018, WSM launched Opry Nashville Radio, a full-time streaming station billed as being \\"based on the Grand Ole Opry and Nashville lifestyle\\" and focusing mainly on contemporary country music. During December, this channel flips to all Christmas music. Miscellany Country and bluegrass legend John Hartford parodied the distinctive style of WSM DJs on the album Aereo-Plain, humorously changing the station's call letters to the phrase \\"Dorothy S. Ma'am.\\" Famous station personnel =Alumni= *Ralph Emery served as the overnight host of WSM from the late 1950s until the early 1970s. Because of his time slot, listeners all over the U.S. could hear Emery spin country music records. This and The Grand Ole Opry solidified WSM's central role in the history of country music. In the 1980s, Emery gained further national fame as the host of Nashville Now! on The Nashville Network; before then, he hosted syndicated radio and television country music interview shows, and a long-running, highly rated morning show on WSMV-TV. *Pat Sajak (host of Wheel of Fortune) served as the afternoon DJ on WSM during the mid-1970s.Dorman, Lee (2009). Nashville Broadcasting. Arcadia Publishing. p. 125. Retrieved August 26, 2018. During that time, he also worked as a weekend weathercaster and substitute talk show host on WSM-TV. *Larry Munson was a sportscaster for the Nashville Vols, Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball and Vanderbilt Commodores football in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as working for WSM-TV. He was later renowned for his long tenure as the legendary voice of Georgia Bulldogs football. *Grant Turner (born Jesse Granderson Turner) was known as the \\"dean of the Opry announcers\\" and had a nearly 50-year association with the station, also announcing country music programs in the early morning hours. His show was so popular that NL&AI; used its title, Opryland USA, as the name for the theme park built in 1972. *Teddy Bart, another Nashville broadcaster of long tenure, began as a singer on shows like Waking Crew and parlayed his skills into hosting that show, an afternoon drive-time program with Munson (above) in the early 1960s and Nashville's first-ever call-in talk show, which ran from 1969 to 1981. He also hosted WSM-TV's Noon Show in the 1970s and anchored WKRN-TV's newscast briefly in the early 1980s before launching the group-discussion radio talk show Roundtable on WLAC in 1985, a show that ran for 20 years on several different stations. *Keith Bilbrey moved to Nashville in 1974 to begin working for WSM, first as a substitute announcer for WSM-FM and then as a full-time disc jockey on WSM's FM and AM stations. Throughout his career, Bilbrey worked every single time slot at WSM and became an iconic voice in the modern history of the station and was truly a fan favorite. In 1982, Bilbrey began announcing on The Grand Ole Opry. When The Nashville Network (TNN) began televising a 30-minute portion of the show in 1985, the young announcer became the first host of Grand Ole Opry Live. Bilbrey hosted Opry Live, along with the Opry warm-up show, Backstage Live, until TNN stopped airing the show in 2000. He also hosted the Opry warm-up show on WSM. His 35-year career at the station ended in 2009. *Ernest Tubb hosted a Midnite Jamboree from his record shop following each episode of the Opry from 1947 until his death.

Liberal Party of 1881 The first Liberal Party of Japan was formed on October 18, 1881, by Itagaki Taisuke and other members of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement (League for the Establishment of a National Assembly) to agitate for the establishment of a national assembly, with a membership based on the ideals of liberal democracy under a constitutional monarchy. It attracted a wide following of former samurai who were discontent because they were no longer an elite class and no longer received stipends from the government. The Jiy≈´t≈ç also aimed for suffrage for samurai and an elected assembly in each prefecture. Itagaki was party president, with Nakajima Nobuyuki as vice- president. Other notable members included Got≈ç Sh≈çjir≈ç, Baba Tatsui, Tetch≈ç Suehiro, Ueki Emori, and Nakae Ch≈çmin. The Meiji government viewed the growth of the Jiy≈´t≈ç with misgivings, suspecting it of harboring tendencies towards republicanism. The party was also made vulnerable due to peasant uprisings in rural areas led or inspired by local Jiy≈´t≈ç members. The Jiy≈´t≈ç voted to dissolve itself on October 29, 1884, on the eve of the Chichibu Incident. In 1887, Got≈ç Shojir≈ç regrouped some members of the former Jiy≈´t≈ç into a proto- party called the Daid≈ç Danketsu Movement. This group split into two groups (Daid≈ç Club led by K≈çno Hironaka and Daid≈ç Ky≈çwakai led by ≈åi Kentar≈ç and Nakae Ch≈çmin ) in March 1889. In 1890, they were merged by Itagaki Taisuke to form the Constitutional Liberal Party, which was later renamed the Liberal Party. Some politicians who supported Got≈ç didn't join this party and formed National Liberal Party.

He also wrote fiction under the name \\"George Goodman\\". Background, education, and career Goodman was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Alexander Mark Goodman and Viona Cremer Goodman. He attended Harvard College, graduating magna cum laude, and served as an editor of The Harvard Crimson. Goodman won a Rhodes Scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read for the B. Litt. His first novel, The Bubble Makers, published simultaneously in the UK and the United States, was written during this period. In 1954, before the Special Forces became the Green Berets, he joined the US Army Special Forces in the Intelligence group known as Psywar (psychological warfare). In 1961, Goodman married American actress Sally Brophy. They eventually had two children before her death in 2007. His personal style of presenting economic facts and data has been described as that of \\"a witty, urbane dinner guest, a droll observer of human affairs\\", rather than a stodgy economics. Goodman pioneered a style of financial writing that made the language and concepts of Wall Street more understandable and accessible to the typical investor. Goodman's first non-fiction book, The Money Game (1968), was a number one bestseller for over a year and earned him the 1969 Gerald Loeb Special Book Award. In Paper Money (1981), he memorably introduced the catchphrase \\"Assume a can opener\\" to mock the tendency of economists to make unjustified assumptions and asked \\"Why are the economists almost always wrong?\\" During a stint in Hollywood, he wrote screen plays, including that for The Wheeler Dealers, starring James Garner and Lee Remick, adapted from his novel of the same title. He was a member of the Editorial Board of The New York Times, an editor of Esquire Magazine, a writer for Fortune magazine, and a founding member of New York magazine where he worked with such writers as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, and Gloria Steinem. In 1984, Goodman came to television as the creator, anchor and editor-in-chief of Adam Smith's Money World. Running on the Public Broadcasting Service in the US, it became the most honored program in its field, winning eight Emmy nominations and five Emmy Awards, as well as the Overseas Press Club Award. The documentary specials won gold medals at the Houston International Film Festival and the Flagstaff Film Festival. The show used cartoon characters and reports from the field to explain and simplify complex financial subjects to its audience. Airing in over forty countries, it was also the first American business news show broadcast in the Soviet Union, airing weekly with a Russian soundtrack. Recent work Beginning in 1998 Goodman traveled the globe each year doing specials on countries and regions with fast-growing or emerging economies such as China, Russia, the Pacific Rim, Latin America, India, and Israel. Goodman has also conducted interviews with leaders in both the fields of business and politics‚Äîranging from Warren Buffett to Mikhail Gorbachev. Beginning March 10, 2008, Goodman appeared along with two other personal finance advisers in the \\"Dollars and Sense\\" television advertising campaign for the Hyundai Motor Company. Death Goodman's son Mark announced his father died at the age of 83 on January 3, 2014, at the University of Miami Hospital after a long battle with the bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis.

In that role, he advocated the Northern Alliance, closer ties with Frederick the Great of Prussia and the establishment of an advisory privy council. His staunch opposition to the partitions of Poland led to his being replaced by the more compliant Prince Bezborodko. Catherine appointed many men to the Senate who were related to Panin's powerful family.John P. LeDonne, \\"Appointments to the Russian Senate, 1762-1769\\" Cahiers du Monde Russe et Sovietique (1975) 16#1 pp 27-56. K. D. Bugrov, \\"Nikita Panin and Catherine II: Conceptual aspect of political relations.\\" RUDN Journal of Russian History 4 (2010): 38-52. Early life and career Nikita Ivanovich Panin was born at Gda≈Ñsk, Poland, to the Russian commandant of P√§rnu, the Estonian city where he would spend most of his childhood. In 1740, he entered the Russian army, and was rumored to be one of the favorites of Empress Elizabeth. In 1747, he was accredited to Copenhagen as Russian minister, but a few months later was transferred to Stockholm, where for the next 12 years he played a conspicuous part as the chief opponent of the French party. During his residence in Sweden, Panin, who certainly had a strong speculative bent, is said to have conceived a fondness for constitutional forms of government. Politically, he was a pupil of Aleksei Bestuzhev; consequently, when in the middle 1750s, Russia suddenly turned francophile instead of francophobe, Panin's position became extremely difficult. However, he found a friend in Bestuzhev's supplanter, Mikhail Vorontsov, and when in 1760 he was unexpectedly appointed the governor of the little grand duke Paul, his influence was assured. Catherine's reign Portrait by Fyodor Rokotov,1760s Panin supported Catherine when she overthrew her husband, Tsar Peter III, and declared herself empress in 1762, but his jealousy of Catherine's lovers caused him to constantly try to sleep with her. Also, his jealousy of the influence which Grigory Orlov and his brothers seemed likely to obtain over the new empress predisposed him to favor the proclamation of his ward the grand duke Paul as emperor, with Catherine as regent only. To circumscribe the influence of the ruling favorites, he next suggested the formation of a cabinet council of six or eight ministers, through whom all the business of the state was to be transacted, but Catherine, suspecting in the skillfully presented novelty a subtle attempt to limit her power, rejected it after some hesitation. Nevertheless, Panin continued to be indispensable. His influence partly was because he was the governor of Paul, who was greatly attached to him, partly to the peculiar circumstances in which Catherine had mounted the throne, and partly to his knowledge of foreign affairs. Although acting as minister of foreign affairs, he was never made chancellor. Panin was the inventor of the famous Northern Accord, which aimed at opposing a combination of Russia, Prussia, Poland, Sweden, and perhaps Great Britain, against the Bourbon-Habsburg League. Such an attempt to bind together nations with such different aims and characters was doomed to failure. Great Britain, for instance, could never be persuaded it was as much in her interests as in the interests of Russia to subsidize the anti-French party in Sweden. Yet, the idea of the Northern Accord, though never quite realized, had important political consequences and influenced the policy of Russia for many years. It explains, too, Panin's strange tenderness towards Poland. For a long time, he could not endure the thought of destroying her, because he regarded her as an indispensable member of his accord, wherein she was to replace Austria, which circumstances had temporarily detached from the Russian alliance. All of the diplomatic questions concerning Russia from 1762 to 1783 are intimately associated with the name of Panin. His influence began to wane only when the impossibility of realizing the Northern Accord, his pet scheme over which Russia had fruitlessly sacrificed millions of rubles, became evident. Decline Panin's tombstone in the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, by Ivan Martos and Giacomo Quarenghi After 1772, when Gustav III upset Panin's plans in Sweden, Panin pursued a policy of the Russo-Prussian alliance. As to Poland, his views differed widely from the views of both Frederick and Catherine. He firmly guaranteed the integrity of Polish territory, after placing Stanislaus II on the throne, so Poland, undivided and as strong as circumstances would permit, might be drawn wholly within the orbit of Russia. He did not foresee, though, the complications which were likely to arise from Russia's interference in the domestic affairs of Poland. Thus, the Confederation of Bar, and the ensuing Russo-Turkish War, took him completely by surprise and considerably weakened his position. He was forced to acquiesce in the first partition of Poland, and when Russia came off third-best, Grigori Orlov declared in the council that the minister who had signed such a partition treaty was worthy of death. Panin further incensed Catherine by meddling with the marriage arrangements of the grand duke Paul and by advocating a closer alliance with Prussia, whereas the empress was beginning to incline more and more towards Austria. Nevertheless, even after Paul's second marriage, Panin maintained all his old influence over his pupil, who, like himself, was now a warm admirer of the king of Prussia. Traditional tales exist from this period of an actual conspiracy of Panin and Paul against the empress. As the Austrian influence increased, Panin found a fresh enemy in Joseph II, and the efforts of the old statesman to prevent a matrimonial alliance between the Russian and Austrian courts catalyzed Catherine into getting rid of a counsellor of whom, for some mysterious reason, she was secretly afraid. The circumstances of his disgrace are complicated and obscure. The final rupture seems to have arisen on the question of the declaration of the armed neutrality of the North, but it is known that Grigori Potemkin and the English ambassador, James Harris (afterwards 1st earl of Malmesbury), had both been working against him some time before that. In May 1781, Panin was dismissed. He died two years later in the spring of 1783. Personal qualities Panin was one of the most learned, accomplished, and courteous Russians of his day. Catherine called him her encyclopaedia. The Earl of Buckinghamshire declared him to be the most amiable negotiator he had ever met. He was also of a most humane disposition and a friend of liberal institutions. As to his honesty and kindness of heart there were never two opinions. By nature a sybarite, he took care to have the best cook in the capital, and women had for him an irresistible attraction, though he never married.

His family said that he had won a coveted scholarship from General Motors to study with Harley Earl, which arrived only after he had already been ordained. He maintained his interest in automotive design, however, which he combined with a belief that there was much which could be done to make current automobiles safer. Conceived, invented and built by Juliano, the Aurora was an long fibreglass-bodied car that was two years on the drawing board and required three years to build. The high quality of the workmanship was \\"astounding\\", particularly in the fibreglass body and the plastic windows. At a retail price of $12,000.00, it would have been priced just under the most costly car in the U.S., the $13,000.00 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. The body, said to be dent, rust, and corrosion proof, was specifically designed for long distance highway travel. The vehicle had a tinted, transparent, plastic \\"astrodome\\" roof with adjustable interior metal shades. Dashboard controlled hydraulic jacks mounted in the frame assisted in tire changing. The spare tire, located under the front end, was mounted on a platform which would lower the tire to the ground without manual contact. The vehicle had many car safety-related features, novel at the time, some now routine. These features included seatbelts, a roll cage, a padded instrument panel, side-impact bars, and a collapsible steering column. The placement of the spare tire under the front end served to absorb impacts. The most innovative safety feature, which has not been incorporated into other cars, was the ability to swivel the seats to face rearwards should a collision seem imminent. The Aurora is mainly remembered for its appearance, however, and is often cited in lists of the ugliest cars ever, frequently as the single ugliest car. This assessment is largely due to two factors, in addition to the general overwrought \\"swoopiness\\" of the car typical of the \\"futuristic\\" styling of the time: the gaping front end and the bulbous windshield, both dictated by safety considerations. The bulging windshield was designed to eliminate impact with occupants' heads, in the era prior to air bags, while the scoop-like front end served as a large, foam filled bumper, designed to scoop up not only air, but also pedestrians without injury. The prototype had a fiberglass body over a largely wooden structure built on the salvaged chassis of a 1953 Buick, which was not adequately tested before the scheduled public unveiling in 1957 and broke down 15 times on the way to the press conference, requiring towing to 7 different garages; mainly due to clogging of the fuel system, which had sat unused for the previous four years. After the inauspicious beginning of arriving hours late for its own unveiling, the car did not inspire the public due to its appearance, lack of performance, and high price, and there were no advance orders. The company's finances were called into question; Juliano stated that that had been instigated by General Motors, and compared himself to Preston Tucker. He was investigated by the IRS, accused by the Catholic Church of misappropriating parishioners' donations, and forced to leave the Order of the Holy Ghost. But in fact, he himself had gone deeply into personal debt financing the company, and eventually declared bankruptcy, forfeiting the prototype to a repair shop as collateral for unpaid repair bills. It passed through several hands before finally being abandoned behind a Cheshire auto body shop in 1967. Juliano died of a brain hemorrhage in 1989. In 1993, the car was discovered by British car enthusiast Andy Saunders of Poole, Dorset, in a sketch in a book about dream cars; \\"It was so ugly it was unreal. I said straightaway, 'I've got to own that.'\\" After several years of searching, he eventually tracked the car down by the name of the garage in the background of a photograph of the car, purchased it sight unseen for $1,500, and had it shipped to Britain for another $2,000. The fiberglass and wood structure of the car proved to have deteriorated terribly from exposure, as well as the interior and plastic windshield. Restoration was further complicated by a lack of adequate documentation or even photographs of the car, the absence of the late Father Juliano to assist as a consultant, and the lack of replacement parts for a prototype vehicle. However, restoration was completed in early 2005, and the car was unveiled to a newly re-astounded public at the Goodwood Festival of Speed and is now on display in the Beaulieu Motor Museum.

The name refers to the seeds of the sycamore tree, Acer pseudoplatanus, which fall with a rotating motion. It has the distinction of being the first British helicopter to receive a certificate of airworthiness, as well as being the first British-designed helicopter to be introduced by and to serve with the Royal Air Force (RAF). Typically capable of seating up to three passengers, the type was often used as a transport for both passengers and cargo alike. In RAF service, the Sycamore was normally used in the search and rescue and casualty evacuation roles. The type proved the value of rotorcraft to easily traverse inhospitable or otherwise inaccessible terrain; the Sycamore made valuable contributions to British military activities during the Malayan Emergency, the Cyprus Emergency, and the Aden Emergency, in addition to other operations. In addition to its British military service, various models of the Sycamore were produced and operated by a number of users, including overseas military operations and civil customers. Civilian operations typically involved transportation, mountain rescue, and aerial survey work. In 1959, production of the Sycamore ended after 180 rotorcraft had been completed. Development During the Second World War, new methods of aircraft propulsion were devised and experimented with; in particular, breakthroughs in rotary aircraft, such as gyrocopters and helicopters, were making such aircraft more practical.\\"Bristol 171 Sycamore.\\" BAE Systems, Retrieved: 20 January 2017. In 1944, Bristol established a specialised helicopter division shortly after the Allied invasion of Europe, when engineers from the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment (AFEE) at Beaulieu became available. The AFEE had been conducting its own work on the development of rotorcraft designs under the noted helicopter pioneer Raoul Hafner; however, the successful use of Horsa and Hamilcar gliders during Operation Overlord had led to helicopter development being recognised as a priority. Hafner, whose company had been acquired by Bristol was promptly appointed by the company as the head of Bristol's new helicopter division.Myall, Eric. Sycamore Seeds: Background and Development of the Bristol Type 171. Air Enthusiast, #77, September/October 1998. pp. 14‚Äì19.\\"Aircraft of the Month: Bristol Sycamore.\\" Tangmere Military Aviation Museum, Retrieved: 2 January 2017. In June 1944, work commenced on the development on a four-seat helicopter intended for both civil and military use; it was out of this programme that the Sycamore would emerge. During development, particular emphasis was assigned to the producing the necessary level of endurance of the rotorcraft's mechanical components. On 25 July 1947, the first prototype, VL958, which was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior (there being no suitable engine in the Bristol range), performed the type's maiden flight. In mid-1948, the third prototype, which had been built to the improved Sycamore Mk.2 standard, was completed; this model had been fitted with a Alvis Leonides engine, the Leonides engine would become the standard powerplant for all subsequent Sycamore production. On 25 April 1949, a certificate of airworthiness was granted for the Sycamore, the first such to be granted to a British helicopter. During the flight test programme, Bristol's key development pilots for the Type 171 included Charles \\"Sox\\" Hosegood and Col. Robert \\"Bob\\" Smith. In 1951, a Bristol-owned Sycamore Mk.2 was used during a series of deck landing trials performed on board the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Triumph.\\"Bristol Aircraft Company.\\" The Helicopter Museum, Retrieved: 2 January 2017. An improved model of the helicopter, designated as the Sycamore Mk.3, was rapidly developed; it featured an increased capacity for five occupants, a wider fuselage and a shortened nose. A total of 23 Sycamore Mk.3s were produced, 15 of these were principally used for joint evaluation purposes by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Army Air Corps (AAC), and British European Airways (BEA). Versions of the Sycamore up to and including the Mk.3A retained the standard two-seat cockpit layout, placing the pilot in the left-hand seat and the co-pilot in the right. However, on the main production model, designated as the Sycamore Mk.4, this seating arrangement had been switched to the standard American practice of positioning the pilot's seat on the right. There were also a number of other developments that had featured upon the earlier versions, such as a four-door design, which had been standardised upon the Sycamore Mk.4. This version entered RAF service, receiving the military designation of HR14. Civil versions were not marketed under the Sycamore name, they were instead known simply as the Bristol Type 171. By May 1958, over 150 Sycamores had been manufactured and four units per month were being built.Flight International 1958, p. 369. Design A sectioned Sycamore main gearbox, displayed in the Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany The Bristol Sycamore is one of the first production helicopters to be developed. Each Sycamore was manufactured with all of the necessary fixed fittings to enable it to be quickly adapted between configurations to perform any of six major roles: search and rescue, air ambulance, passenger transport, freight transport, aerial crane and dual instruction; it was also used for other specialised roles. The Sycamore is capable of seating four-to-five occupants, dependent upon model, within the main cabin; it was typically outfitted with a total of three folding canvas seats along with a single rotating seat besides the pilot. In addition to the main cabin, it also has a separate luggage compartment. A specialised air ambulance model of the Sycamore was developed during the early 1950s. In this configuration, up to two patients were internally-stowed on stretchers stacked one over the other in the cabin; this was contrary to the conventional arrangement of the era of using externally-mounted \\"pods\\" in which to carry patients instead. To provide the extra width necessary to accommodate this arrangement, detachable Perspex blisters are fitted on each side of the cabin. The stretcher racks could be folded into the sides of the cabin, providing room for up to three sitting casualties instead; a purpose-built electrical point is also provided for powering electric blankets. Adjacent to the pilot is a swivelling seat intended for a medical attendant.\\"New Ambulance Helicopter.\\" Flight International, 3 August 1951. p. 151. The blades of the three-bladed main rotor are attached to the rotor head via a lightweight and strong interleaving steel plates while tie-rods absorb direct centrifugal force under tension. The blade levers are connected via ball joints to the arms of a control spider, the cone of which being actuated up and down by the collective pitch lever in order to change to pitch of all of the blades; an irreversible mechanism is present to prevent blade loads being transferred back to the control stick. The blades are supported when still or at slow rotational speeds by droop stops, which serve to keep a level of clearance between the blades and the fuselage even under high wind conditions; these stops are withdrawn above 100 RPM so that full freedom of movement for effective flight is possible.Flight International 1958, pp. 369‚Äì370. The Sycamore is powered by a single Alvis Leonides piston engine, capable of outputting 550 hp.Flight International 1958, p. 370. The engine is mounted on below and to the rear of the main rotor on a flexible mounting in order to reduce vibrations. It is isolated within a fireproof casing, the compartment is also fitted with fire extinguishing equipment that conformed with the relevant regulations of the era. Cooling is achieved via air drawn through a forward-set grill, actively cooling the gearbox prior to passing through the engine cowling and exiting the fuselage. Control of the engine is linked to the collective pitch lever, power being automatically controlled by the rotor pitch setting being commanded; fine adjustment of engine power is achieved via twisting actions on the pitch handle lever. The Sycamore had a relatively high rotor speed for the era, which was claimed to deliver increased smoothness during flight and provide for a safety advantage in the event of engine failure. Operational history A West German air force Sycamore Mk.14 at the 1958 Farnborough Air Show From 1952 to 1955 the Sycamore was used for various trials by the Air Sea Warfare Development Unithttps://www.helis.com/database/sqd/328/ which was stationed at RAF St. Mawgan. In April 1953, the Sycamore HR14 entered service with 275 Squadron of the RAF and went on to serve with nine squadrons in total. Various marks of Sycamore served with the RAF; they would primarily be used as air ambulances (Sycamore HC.10), for Army communications (Sycamore HC.11) and for search and rescue operations (Sycamore HR.12 through the Sycamore HR.14). In 1953, No. 275 Squadron, equipped with Sycamores, became the RAF's first helicopter search and rescue squadron in Great Britain. The type was used by the Royal Air Force Central Flying School for pilot training purposes. The Sycamore was heavily used during the Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960), typically deploying Army foot patrols into the jungle. Numerous Sycamores were transferred to the Far East Air Force to participate in the conflict; however, the type was involved in a number of crashes in the region which had occurred as a result of tail or main rotor blade problems.\\"For Jungle Rescue.\\" Flight International, 13 February 1953. p. 87. In response, a series of blade trials were conducted prior to a modified blade design being adopted and Sycamore operations in the theatre being resumed. Following the end of most combat operations in August 1960, Sycamores remained in the region, including a detachment in Brunei, to support British forces stationed there to deter further aggression by Malayan communist guerrillas. Sycamore of 103 Squadron RAF in Cyprus, 1961 The type also saw combat service with the RAF during the Cyprus Emergency and the Aden Emergency, in addition to other operations. In December 1971, the last of the RAF's Sycamores were officially retired; this had been due to critical parts having reached the end of their fatigue life. However 32 Squadron continued to operate two Sycamores until August 1972. A total of 50 Sycamores were delivered to the German Federal Government. Three helicopters were produced for the Belgian Government for use in the Belgian Congo; it had been picked due to the type's good capabilities in tropical environments, as proven during its combat use in Malaysia.\\"Belgian Sycamores.\\" Flight International, 2 April 1954. p. 392. The Sycamore also has the distinction of being the second helicopter type to be used by the Australian Defence Force; a total of 10 were delivered to the Royal Australian Navy. The Sycamore was also used in a variety of civilian roles. A single example was used during the construction of the M1 motorway between London and Leeds; the type provided support in various roles, including to perform aerial surveying, communication across various sites, the carriage of both personnel and equipment, and the mitigation of flooding on the project.\\"A Highway and a Helicopter.\\" Flight International, 8 August 1958. p. 204.

Fundamental concept Among the earliest hulls were simple logs, but these were generally unstable and tended to roll over easily. Hollowing out the logs into a dugout canoe doesn't help much unless the hollow section penetrates below the log's center of buoyancy, then a load carried low in the cavity actually stabilizes the craft. Adding weight or ballast to the bottom of the hull or as low as possible within the hull adds stability. Naval architects place the center of gravity substantially below the center of buoyancy; in most cases this can only be achieved by adding weight or ballast. The use of stones and other weights as ballast can be traced back to the Romans, Phoenicians and Vikings. Modern ships carry tons of ballast in order to maintain their stability; even heavily laden cargo ships use ballast to optimize the distribution of weight. Uses This is the most prevalent form of waterborne vessel. Variations *Keels - Most sailing ships and larger sailboats have deep keels containing ballast which adds horizontal stabilility. *Displacement hulls - Monohull boats frequently ride deeply in the water, this is known as a displacement hull. *Planing hulls - Hulls that ride on top of the water are called planing hulls, because when they reach speed, the hulls are substantially lifted above the water; this is known as planing (to plane).

Vehicles featured a conventional chassis layout and a choice of five bodies, locally made under the motto 'Made in Australia, by Australians, for Australia'. Most models were fitted with Rutenber Straight-6 engines and Grand Lees or Muncie gearboxes; some, however, had imported OHV Ansted engines instead. Before 1919 the factory was at the Sydney Harbour side suburb of Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales, it then moved to Ashfield until 1924. The company was forced to shut down production after some 500 cars were built; this was due mainly to high local construction costs. The final few cars were made by the Harkness and Hillier hire car company in Sydney. Sixteen Australian Sixes survive, one in the Powerhouse Museum automobile collection in Sydney, one in the York Motor Museum, York, Western Australia, this is one of the first six built without a chassis number in the first factory. The term Australian Six (or \\"Big Aussie six\\" etc.) is sometimes used to refer to Australian-built large family cars such as the Ford Falcon, Holden Commodore/Toyota Lexcen, Toyota Avalon/Aurion, the Mitsubishi Magna/380, the Chrysler Valiant & the Leyland P76, which often have six-cylinder engines as standard. In 1984 the car was honoured on a postage stamp, part of a series of five depicting early Australian automobiles, issued by Australia Post .

Taylor was born in Meadow Lea, Manitoba, the son of William Taylor and Marietta Jane Plummer, and was educated in Winnipeg. He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1900 and worked as a barrister. He served as mayor of Portage la Prairie from 1912 to 1915. Taylor married Mabel Agnes Dykeman in 1901. He was named King's Counsel in 1913. In the provincial election of 1915, he ran as a Conservative candidate in the Portage la Prairie constituency and was defeated. Taylor resigned as mayor later in 1915 to enlist for service in the First World War. Already a captain in the 99th Manitoba Rangers, he was quickly promoted to Major and served in France with the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles from 1916 to 1918. On returning, he became President of the Army and Navy Veterans in Canada (Dominion Association). Taylor sought the leadership of provincial Conservatives in 1919, but was defeated by Richard G. Willis. He was elected for Portage la Prairie in the provincial election of 1920, and was chosen as party leader in a second attempt on April 5, 1922, defeating John Thomas Haig. The Manitoba Conservatives had governed the province from 1900 to 1915, but were in a weak position when Taylor became the party's leader. The scandals of the Roblin government had led to a catastrophic defeat in 1915, with the Conservatives winning only won five of 47 seats. They increased their total to seven in 1920, but were in danger of becoming marginalized by the rise of the United Farmers of Manitoba and Labour. Taylor's first campaign as party leader was not particularly successful. The UFM swept the countryside in the 1922 campaign, with Labour and the Liberals dominating Winnipeg. Taylor faced a strong challenge from Liberal cabinet minister Charles Duncan McPherson in Portage la Prairie, winning by only 131 votes out of 2743 cast. Subsequently, Taylor brought the party back to a more viable position. By now a lieutenant colonel, Taylor brought the Conservatives back to 15 seats and official opposition status in the election of 1927. Leading up to the 1932 election, his party was regarded as having a real chance to form government. This did not occur, however. The federal Liberals were concerned about a Conservative victory in the province, and convinced their provincial affiliate to form an alliance with the governing Progressives (as the UFM government had renamed itself). The combined resources of these parties weakened the Conservative position. Taylor was also damaged by the unpopularity of Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bennett. Taylor's own plan to redistribute land to the poor was criticized by many as ineffective. The Conservatives won only 10 seats in the 1932 election. Taylor resigned the party leadership in April 1933, after being appointed a judge in the Manitoba Court of King's Bench. He was succeeded in the Portage la Prairie riding by Toby Sexsmith. He died at home in Winnipeg and was buried in Portage la Prairie.

L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church.

Age of Faith. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972 Arian Goths In the 4th century, the bishop Wulfila (c 310 - 383) invented a script for the Gothic language, translated the Bible into Gothic, and converted the Goths to Arian Christianity.Herwig Wolfram, History of the Goths, (University of California Press, 1988), 75. When the Visigoths traveled west, they encountered Latin Christians, for whom Arianism was anathema. The Visigoths held to their Arian beliefs and refused to join the Catholic Church. Attempts to Unify Prior to the Council in Toledo, King Reccared had convened informal assemblies of bishops to resolve the religious schism in his kingdom. At the second assembly both Arian and Catholic bishops presented their arguments, while Reccared pointed out that no Arian bishop had ever performed a healing miracle. The last assembly consisted of only Catholic bishops, where upon Reccared accepted the Catholic faith.Rachel L. Stocking, Bishops, Councils, and Consensus in the Visigothic Kingdom, 589-633, (The University of Michigan Press, 2000), 60-61. Bishop Leander and King Reccared The Council was organized by Bishop Leander of Seville, who had worked tirelessly to convert the Arian Visigothic kings and had succeeded with Reccared. Abbot Eutropius had the chief day-to- day management of the council, according to the chronicler John of Biclaro. In the king's name, Leander brought together bishops and nobles in May of 589. However, King Reccared and Bishop Leander were only able to persuade eight Arian bishops to attend the council. Council proceedings =Opening= The Council opened on May 4, with three days of prayer and fasting. Then, the public confession of King Reccared was read aloud by a notary. Its theological precision defining Trinitarian and Arian tenets, establishing Reccared's newly achieved orthodoxy, and its extensive quotation from scripture revealed that it was in fact ghostwritten for the king, doubtless by Leander. =Declarations= In it, Reccared declared that God had inspired him to lead the Goths back to the true faith, from which they had been led astray by false teachers. (In fact they had been Christianized by the Arian Ulfilas, but Leander's theme was reconciliation.) He declared that not only the Goths but the Suebi, who by the fault of others had been led into heresy, had been brought back to the faith. These nations he dedicated to God by the hands of the bishops, whom he called on to complete the work. He then anathematized Arius and his doctrine, and declared his acceptance of the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, Chalcedon and pronounced an anathema on all who returned to Arianism after being received into the Church by the chrism, or the laying on of hands; then followed the creeds of Nicaea and Constantinople and the definition of Chalcedon, and the tome concluded with the signatures of Reccared and Baddo his queen. This confession was received with a general acclamation. One of the Catholic bishops then called on the assembled bishops, clergy, and Gothic nobles to declare publicly their renunciation of Arianism and their acceptance of Catholicism. They replied that although they had done so already when they had gone over with the king to the Church, they would comply. =Anathemas= Then followed 23 anathemas directed against Arius and his doctrines, succeeded by the creeds of Nicaea and Constantinople and the definition of Chalcedon, the whole being subscribed by 8 Arian bishops with their clergy, and by all the Gothic nobles. The bishops were Ugnas of Barcelona, Ubiligisclus of Valencia, Murila of Palencia, Sunnila of Viseu, Gardingus of Tuy, Bechila of Lugo, Argiovitus of Oporto, and Froisclus of Tortosa. The names of the eight are Germanic in origin. Four come from sees within the former kingdom of the Suebi, probably showing that Leovigild, after his conquest, had displaced the Catholic bishops by Arians. =Canons= Reccared then instructed the council with his licence to draw up any requisite canons, particularly one directing the creed to be recited at Communion, so that henceforward no one could plead ignorance as an excuse for misbelief. Then followed 23 canons with a confirmatory edict of the king. *The 1st confirmed the decrees of previous councils of the Catholic Church and synodical letters of the popes; *the 2nd directed the recitation of the creed of Constantinople at Holy Communion, with the addition of the Filioque clause: Credo in Spiritum Sanctum qui ex patre filioque procedit (\\"I believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father and Son\\") which was never accepted in the Christian East and led to drawn-out controversy; *the 5th forbade the converted Arian bishops, priests, and deacons to live with their wives; *the 7th directed that the Scriptures should be read at a bishop's table during meals; *the 9th transferred Arian churches to the bishops of their dioceses; *the 13th forbade clerics to proceed against other clerics before lay tribunals; *the 14th forbade Jews to have Christian wives, concubines, or slaves, ordered the children of such unions to be baptized, and disqualified Jews from any office in which they might have to punish Christians. Christian slaves whom they had circumcised, or made to share in their rites, were ipso facto freed; *the 21st forbade civil authorities to lay burdens on clerics or the slaves of the church or clergy; *the 22nd forbade wailing at funerals; *the 23rd forbade celebrating the eves of Saint's days with dances and songs, characterized as \\"indecent\\". The canons were subscribed first by the king, then by 5 of the 6 metropolitans, of whom Masona signed first; 62 bishops signed in person, 6 by proxy. All those of Tarraconensis and Septimania appeared personally or by proxy; in other provinces several were missing. =Closing= The proceedings closed with a triumphant homily by Leander on the conversion of the Goths, preserved by his brother Isidore as Homilia de triumpho ecclesiae ob conversionem Gothorum a homily upon the \\"triumph of the Church and the conversion of the Goths.\\" Effects of the council The proscriptions against Jews were soon followed by required conversions, which led to a wholesale flight of Jews from Visigothic Spain to Ceuta and technically Visigothic nearby territories in North Africa. There, a community of exiles and malcontents formed, that were later to provide useful alliance and information at the time of the Moorish invasion in 711. The filioque clause spread through the Latin-literate West but not through the Greek- speaking East. The Franks adopted it, but its use caused controversy in the 9th century. Its use spread to Rome soon after 1000, and it contributed to the Great Schism (1054) between the Eastern Orthodox and Catholics. Sources *Thompson, E. A. (1969) The Goths in Spain.

Emission patterns of the localizer and glide slope signals. An instrument landing system localizer, or simply localizer (LOC), is a system of horizontal guidance in the instrument landing system, which is used to guide aircraft along the axis of the runway. ;See also:  Principle of operation In aviation, a localizer is the lateral component of the instrument landing system (ILS) for the runway centerline when combined with the vertical glide slope, not to be confused with a locator, although both are parts of aviation navigation systems. A localizer (like a glideslope) works as a cooperation between the transmitting airport runway and the receiving cockpit instruments. An older aircraft without an ILS receiver cannot take advantage of any ILS facilities at any runway, and much more importantly, the most modern aircraft have no use of their ILS instruments at runways which lack ILS facilities. In parts of Africa and Asia large airports may lack any kind of transmitting ILS system. Some runways have ILS only in one direction, this can however still be used (with a lower precision) known as back beam or \\"Back Course\\" which is not associated with a glide slope.  Carrier frequency pairings for localizer and glide slope  Two signals are transmitted on one of 40 ILS channels. One is modulated at 90 Hz, the other at 150 Hz. These are transmitted from co-located antennas. Each antenna transmits a narrow beam. Localizer (LOC) and glide slope (G/S) carrier frequencies are paired so that the navigation radio automatically tunes the G/S frequency which corresponds to the selected LOC frequency. The LOC signal is in the 110 MHz range while the G/S signal is in the 330 MHz range. LOC carrier frequencies range between 108.10 MHz and 111.95 MHz (with the 100 kHz first decimal digit always odd, so 108.10, 108.15, 108.30, etc., are LOC frequencies and are not used for any other purpose). See Instrument Landing System (ILS) Frequencies on even-numbered TACAN channels from 18X to 56Y. Localizer in cockpit Attitude Indicator, or perhaps more commonly known as the artificial horizon. The localizer is shown on the scale below the attitude gauge, and is in this case looking almost as a small white \\"^\\" sign. Both the indicator and its scale are small The localizer indicator is (on most aircraft manufactured from the late 1950s) shown below the Attitude Indicator, but is still a part of this instrument together with the glideslope indicator and the cross in the center of the instrument which is called Flight Director. The glideslope scale is located to the right of the attitude sphere. On aircraft which have a mechanical gyro compass are both the localizer and glideslope indicated as a vertical and a horizontal arrow in the compass as well. But they are essentially read in the same way. On some aircraft is only the glideslope indicated on two main instruments, and the oldest version of ILS-instruments was an instrument of its own used instead. This used two dangling bars, fixed in the middle of the top (localizer indicator) and in the middle of the left side (glideslope indicator), and if the aircraft was located on the intended glidepath, the dangling bars formed a cross. This is, in theory, however, more difficult to learn‚Äîbut even for pilots experienced with using such indicators, it added another instrument they needed to focus on. With the indicators added to the artificial horizon (and to the compass), the pilot can theoretically watch the attitude simultaneously with the localizer and glideslope. In modern cockpits, the localizer is seen as a colored dot (usually in the shape of a diamond) at the bottom of the artificial horizon gauge. It does not appear during cruise, but comes up during the descent and approach to the selected runway, provided that the navigation radio is set to the ILS frequency of that specific runway. If the transmitted localizer beam, which usually, but not always, is directed in the heading of the runway extension. (exceptions exist, for instance, in Innsbruck, Austria and in Macao, China) If the aircraft is located on this line, the localizer dot will appear in the middle of the scale. But if the aircraft is located a little left of the beam, the marker will appear to the right on the localizer gauge scale in cockpit. The pilot then knows he or she must adjust the heading towards the dot. In older cockpits, the localizer scale below the artificial horizon is rather short. But in older style cockpit instrumentation, the localizer also appears as an arrow in the gyro compass below the artificial horizon. The top and bottom of this arrow \\"is one unit\\", which shows current heading. But the middle part of this arrow is moving independently of the aircraft's heading. The middle of that arrow could be described as being \\"stand alone\\", and moves to the left if the aircraft is located to the right of localizer beam and to the right if the aircraft is located to the left of the localizer beam. When the arrow is \\"united\\" to a straight line, then the aircraft is following the localizer beam. (This second \\"arrow-indicator\\" is omitted in modern cockpits, but the main compass is still located below the artificial horizon) At previously mentioned exceptions of runways, where the ILS beam is not leading all the way to the runway, the runway needs to be visible before the final approach begins. The very first generation of localizer gauges had a different cockpit interface, and were not included in the artificial horizon nor any compass, but at a gauge of its own. The localizer was then represented as a dangling stick hanging from a fixed point at the top of a separate gauge, and the glideslope was represented by a similar, but horizontal, dangling stick, fixed at one of the sides of the gauge. When the aircraft was located exactly at the ILS-beam (or glidepath) the two sticks formed a cross. This interface resembles the flight director, which also forms a cross, but on the artificial horizon. This older ILS instrumentation system was omitted around the same time as jet airliners like Boeing 707 and DC 8 were introduced. The expression \\"Catch the localizer\\" refers to runway approaches with the autopilot engaged. The angle between the aircraft heading and localizer beam should be less than 30 degrees, and the indicated airspeed at least below 250 knots (for jet airliners), then by pushing a button marked \\"APP\\" or \\"ILS\\", then the autopilot presumably will turn and then follow the localizer. The autopilot will then also automatically descend according to the glideslope. Normal procedure is to capture the localizer first and then follow the glideslope as well. If the angle is too large or the airspeed too high, capturing the localizer may be unsuccessful. Modern aircraft can land \\"themselves\\", provided the runway ILS is of sufficient standard (class III C) and the cross wind component is low. Autolandings are mostly done in foggy weather. The cockpit ILS indicators are not to be confused with the flight director, which also places vertical and horizontal lines on the artificial horizon. A flight director only shows how the autopilot would fly. If the localizer dot (or arrow) indicate runway is to be found to the left, but the flight director suggests a right turn, and the runway isn't visible, then the pilot in command is having difficulties. Some runways have ILS beams intended for use in one direction only. However, as the localizer beam by its nature also goes backwards, it can still be of some use. This is called back beam. It's of help during the approach, but the use of back beam localizer gives less precision compared to normal use. Localizer at runways When the glideslope is unserviceable, the localizer element can often be conducted as a separate non-precision approach, abbreviated to 'LOC'. A standalone instrument approach installation without an associated glidepath carries the abbreviation 'LLZ'. In some cases, a course projected by localizer is at an angle to the runway (usually due to obstructions near the airport). It is then referred to as a localizer type directional aid (LDA). The localizer system is placed about 1,000 feet from the far end of the approached runway. Usable volume extends to 18 NM for a path up to 10¬∞ either side of runway centerline. At an angle of 35¬∞ either side of runway centerline, the useful volume extends up to 10 NM. Horizontal accuracy increases as distance between the aircraft and localizer decreases. Localizer approach specific weather minimums are found on approach plates.

A quirky sketch comedy series that included some educational content amid its zany humour, the show's cast included Billy Van, Fishka Rais, Guy Big, Mitch Markowitz, Vincent Price, and Julius Sumner Miller. Van played most of the characters on the show. All 130 episodes were made in a nine-month span starting in 1971; the scenes with Price and Miller were all filmed within one summer. In 2018, the production company Headspinner announced that it had acquired licensing and merchandising rights to the series, and was exploring the possibility of creating a new reboot.\\"'The Hilarious House of Frightenstein' Is Coming Back\\".

Origins The production started with Riff Markowitz envisioning the concept and then inviting a room full of creative friends to a spaghetti and champagne 'brainstorming' dinner party in his double suite at the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto. Markowitz directed the brainstorming session while his assistant Roger John Greco made notes of everything said. CHCH had broadcast two other Markowitz shows: The Randy Dandy Show for children, starring Rafael Markowitz as Randy Dandy; and The Ed Allen Show, an exercise program. CHCH approved the production of Frightenstein to take advantage of the station's new ability to reach into the Toronto market for advertising money. Randy Dandy's soda pop venture was later taken up by the Count when he promoted Dracola from the castle to raise money for his Brucie project. Sid Biby led the station at this time. The Hilarious House of Frightenstein was one of the most ambitious shows attempted by Canadian producers during this era. Markowitz later began production of an animated cartoon version of the show with animator Al Guest that never got on the air. Horror icon Vincent Price starred in introductions for the show's various segments.\\"More horrors from Price\\". The Globe and Mail, June 26, 1971. Price, who was attracted to the project because he wanted to do something for kids, filmed all of his nearly 400 segments in four days for a fee of $13,000. Julius Sumner Miller, an American scientist and TV personality, appeared in every episode; although he put on a \\"mad scientist\\" persona, his segments featured straightforward science lessons and experiments. On Canadian television stations, the show generally aired as a children's show in an after-school or weekend morning time slot. In the United States, however, many stations aired it in a late night slot aimed primarily at college students. In an interview with film critic Richard Crouse on CFRB in the 2010s, Markowitz's brother Mitch Markowitz ‚Äî also an associate producer and bit-part performer on the show ‚Äî acknowledged that while he and his brother always recognized the show had kid appeal because of the zany monster characters and lowbrow humour, it was always intended to also appeal to a young adult audience of alternative comedy fans.\\"Mitch Markowitz on the Hilarious House of Frightenstein\\". RichardCrouse.ca, October 26, 2013. In some American markets, the show drew higher ratings than The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson among that demographic. Theme song The opening and closing credits were accompanied by a musical composition played entirely on a Moog synthesizer and written by Harry Breuer, Gary Carol, Jean Jacques Perrey and Pat Prilly. Its title is \\"March of the Martians\\". The original recording can be found on an out-of- print Pickwick vinyl album called The Happy Moog. Characters 250px Although each episode was nominally structured around the basic narrative premise of Count Frightenstein's efforts to revive Brucie J. Monster, a Frankenstein-like monster, only some sketches (including the first sketch of each episode) directly addressed the premise itself, while most sketches depicted unrelated goings-on around the castle. Only the two main characters appeared in the \\"plot\\" sketches, although they could also appear in other sketches as well, while the supplementary characters generally only appeared in their own standalone sketches and were not part of the core \\"plot\\" sketches. =Main= *Count Frightenstein (Van), the main character, was the 13th son of Count Dracula. Exiled to Castle Frightenstein in Frankenstone for his failure to revive Brucie, the core premise of the show was that he would be allowed to return to Transylvania only when (and if) he succeeded in his quest. Count Frightenstein was also a \\"black sheep\\" vampire in other ways, including his strong preference for eating pizza rather than drinking human blood.\\"Billy Van was able to see funny side of Canadian TV ; Versatile comic dies at 68 after battle with cancer\\". Toronto Star, January 9, 2003. He also fancies himself an inventor, although his inventions generally have one of three faults: they are either dangerous, useless, or already a common household object upon which his version is not an improvement. *Igor (Fishka Rais) was Frightenstein's incompetent assistant. =Supporting= Supporting characters were played by Billy Van, except where specified. *The Wolfman - A werewolf disk jockey at radio station EECH who spun rock and roll records while doing a Wolfman Jack impression. The Wolfman's theme song was Sly and the Family Stone's \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\". The segment featured then- current hit singles by The Rolling Stones, Sly and the Family Stone, Three Dog Night or other Top 40 radio stars of the time (which were referred to as ‚Äògolden oldies‚Äô in order to avoid dating the program), with the Wolfman and Igor dancing in silhouette against a psychedelic background. For licensing reasons, the musical numbers are no longer shown on some reruns, although broadcasts on YTV in the early 2000s included the segments. *The Grammar Slammer - The Grammar Slammer was a disembodied voice who challenged Igor to correct grammatical errors, accompanied by an eight-foot purple monster named Bammer who threatened to beat up Igor if he failed. *The Professor (Julius Sumner Miller) - A professor who provided science lessons on such things as thermal expansion and the cartesian diver. *Bwana Clyde Batty - A British explorer who teaches about wild animals on Zany Zoo. His name is a spoof of animal trainer Clyde Beatty. His catchphrase is \\"ooga booga!\\" *Dr. Pet Vet - A veterinarian who teaches about domestic animals (whereas Zany Zoo was about wild fauna). He always offers the day's animal to Igor as a pet, but the Sloth in the basement invariably refuses to allow Igor to keep the animal. *Grizelda, the Ghastly Gourmet - A witch voiced as a parody of Julia Child, who provides a version of a television cooking show as she cooks suitably ghastly recipes in her cauldron. In every one of her segments, she bangs her head on the pot above her cauldron, and invariably declares the recipe a failure after it causes a small explosion. *The Librarian - An elderly curmudgeon who unsuccessfully tries to scare the viewers by reading children's stories, such as \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" and \\"Henny Penny\\", which he thinks are horror stories. He also sometimes reads fables with unpleasant endings. He eventually admits to not being any more frightened than the viewers, but considers reading important nonetheless. *The Maharishi - A Hindu guru who shares bits of mystically inscrutable wisdom (e.g. \\"It is written, that he who kicks the blind beggar, in the marketplace, during an eclipse, can only curse the camel, for its lack of discipline.\\") A large bag of flowers (dyed carnations) would then fall on top of his head afterward. *The Oracle - A mystic who reads out horoscopes in a Peter Lorre voice, invariably knocking over and breaking his crystal ball in the process. He also would often get his hand temporarily stuck inside his replacement crystal ball. He then answers questions supposedly sent in from viewers. *The Mini-Count (Guy Big) is a three-foot tall clone of the Count, who appears in brief sketches where he tells a joke. Big was originally slated to play the main role as the Count, as the original character concept was based in part on the sight gag of a diminutive Count contrasted against Igor's imposing height and weight. However, Big was not experienced enough as an actor to properly maintain Count Frightenstein's desired accent, so the role was recast to star Van while a new smaller role was written for Big. =Puppets= Puppet characters were performed by puppeteer Joe Torbay. *Harvey Wallbanger - The postmaster of Castle Frightenstein's \\"dead letter office\\", he would appear in sketches with the Count or Grizelda in which they answer letters. *Gronk - A purple sea serpent who interacts with the Count or the Wolfman. Gronk would announce his presence with a loud call of \\"Gronk!\\" Gronk's segments usually had the Count reading a book; the Count would then start explaining what the book was about, with Gronk interrupting him, usually mid-sentence, with a completely incorrect conclusion to what the Count had been reading. This would happen several times, leading to greater and greater frustration on the part of the Count. Segments with the Wolfman were generally one-line or two-line jokes. *Bammer - A large purple monster who assisted the Grammar Slammer in correcting Igor's poor grammar. =Minor or interstitial characters= *Super Hippy (Mitch Markowitz) ‚Äî A hippie in a superhero costume who appears leading in and out of commercials, sitting or flying in varying locations as he delivers some variation on \\"Don't change the channel; we'll be right back after these commercials.\\" *The Singing Soldier (Van) ‚Äî A light-operetta styled palace guard who gets a cream pie thrown in his face whenever he starts to sing \\"Indian Love Call\\" from Rose-Marie. *The Mosquito (Mitch Markowitz) - A mosquito who tells a bad joke about insects before biting a human foot. *The Gorilla (Van or Paul Schultz) - A gorilla who would walk out of the jungle and invariably try to scare whomever he was looking at.

He often tried to avoid the ping-pong balls, in one instance by holding up a parasol. Home video On October 18, 2005, Empire Pictures released a single DVD featuring a handful of half-hour U.S.-syndicated episodes. The most significant change for these episodes as broadcast (apart from the length) was the addition of a laugh track. On October 17, 2006, Alliance Atlantis Home Video in Canada released a three-disc box set of 13 full-length episodes, with restored Wolfman segments. The shows are not in chronological order, as only episodes that had thus far obtained music clearances for the Wolfman dance segments were included. The Wolfman theme, Sly & the Family Stone's \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\", had not yet been cleared, so the opening was altered with new music by the Tijuana Bibles from Toronto, and Van's voice was redubbed by another Toronto voice actor, as Van himself had died in 2003. For recent airings in Canada on the cable networks Drive-In Classics and Space, the main Frightenstein theme is also a re- recording, because of licensing restrictions by Morning Music, Ltd. Critical Mass Releasing Inc. of Toronto released the series in 2006 for broadcast on CHUM Television stations. A second set of nine episodes was released by Critical Mass in late 2008. On July 19, 2019, the entire series became available to stream on Crave in Canada. Memorable quotes * Opening Poem - Vincent Price - \\"Another lovely day begins, for ghosts and ghouls with greenish skin. So close your eyes and you will find that you've arrived in Frightenstein. Perhaps the Count will find a way to make his monster work today. For if he solves this monster-mania, he can return to Transylvania! So welcome where the sun won't shine, to the castle of Count Frightenstein!\\" (this dissolved into maniacal laughter). * National Anthem - Igor/Fishka Rais - \\"Gory, gory Transylvania! Where wolves and bats will always maim ya. The murky moors will likely claim ya, As we go stumbling through, through, through, through.\\" Sung to the tune of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\". Sung once by Igor before the Count recites the Pledge, hummed by him during the Count's Pledge, and repeated afterwards by him as a big finish (\\"Gory, gory, Transylvania! As we go stumbling...\\") usually topped off by the Count singing the last word (\\"through!\\"). * Pledge - Count/Billy Van - \\"I pledge by the sign of the three-toed sloth, that I will do my best to do my duty. To always obey the laws of the werewolf pack. And to never rest, until Brucie lives once more, and takes his rightful place in the annals of distinguished monsters, and I can once again return to that most goriest of homelands...\\" (many times the Count is showing off his heart-shaped three-toed sloth pendant (on an elastic black string around his neck) to the camera. After the first line, he lets go of it, it flies back against his throat, and the Count does a choked/injured double take before going on with the rest of the Pledge). * Closing Poem - Vincent Price - \\"The castle lights are growing dim. There's no one left but me-and him. [he nods towards Brucie behind him] When next we meet in Frankenstone...don't come alone.\\"  Legacy  The Hilarious House of Frightenstein was referenced in the first episode of the Ed the Sock program This Movie Sucks!, which is another program produced and broadcast by CHCH. In the episode the hosts refer to them being in a studio that has produced many classic television shows, and Ed comments that they have the coffee maker from The Hilarious House of Frightenstein, along with the original coffee. Comedian Mike Myers acknowledged the show as an important formative influence on his comedy in his 2016 book Mike Myers' Canada.

His best-known works include books, film and biographical plays about Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis, including Maud Lewis The Heart on the Door, and Maud Lewis - World Without Shadows. His plays include one about international singer Portia White, who was born in Nova Scotia: Portia White - First You Dream. Biography =Early life= Woolaver was born in Digby County, Nova Scotia, in 1948. He attended Acadia and Dalhousie universities in Nova Scotia, and the Sorbonne in Paris. As a child, Woolaver had seen Maud and Everett Lewis, and their tiny painted house. He noticed tourists stopping to buy paintings, but kept his distance from these local characters. However, he was later inspired to pitch an article on Maud Lewis to Chatelaine magazine. The article was accepted on the condition that Woolaver co-write it with a female author. He wrote with his mother, and the resulting article, \\"The Joyful Art of Maud Lewis,\\" published in December 1975, was purchased for $700, a sum he considered \\"a fortune\\" at the time. This enabled and encouraged him to devote time to writing. He later wrote a book and two plays about Maud Lewis. Woolaver published earlier stories in the 1970s in Canadian literary magazines, including the Wascana Review (which ceased publication in 2012) and The Fiddlehead. =Marriage and family= Woolaver lives in Halifax with his wife, Martha (Spencer) of Saskatoon. They married in 1967, and have two children, and two grandchildren. Woolaver enjoys flyfishing in the Canadian Rockies, and on the Margaree River in Cape Breton Island. Literary career Woolaver wrote the book The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis (1996), with photographs by Bob Brooks. It was awarded the Dartmouth Book Award and the Atlantic Booksellers Award. It was adapted as a film of the same name (with screenplay by Woolaver) that aired on Canadian VisionTV in 1998. The film was directed by Peter d'Entremont and produced by Triad Film Productions and the National Film Board of Canada.The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis, Triad Film Productions Woolaver's play Maud Lewis - World Without Shadows has been produced by professional and community theatres, including Neptune Theatre (Halifax), King‚Äôs Theatre of Annapolis Royal and Ship‚Äôs Company Theatre of Parrsboro in Nova Scotia, and the Blyth Festival of Ontario. It was also adapted and produced as a CBC Radio national broadcast. His play The Poor Farm, was produced at the Chester Playhouse under the direction of Christopher Heide of Mahone Bay. It was the first play in Nova Scotia to engage actors of Mi‚Äôkmaq, White, Black and Acadian heritage in the same production. It dealt with the politics of poverty and the system of provincial poor farms. Woolaver's collection of Christmas songs, The Noel Cantata, was recently produced in Norway. His young adult novel The Outlaw League (1991) was adapted for film, and he wrote the screenplay. Based in his hometown, it was shot in Restigouche, New Brunswick. It was produced in Montreal as La Gang des Hors la Loi; it won the Vancouver Reel to Real Film Festival in 2015. His play Portia White - First You Dream, about Portia White, a Nova Scotia native and Canada's first black singer to win international acclaim, has been produced by several theaters, including the Victoria Playhouse in Petrolia, Ontario. His newest novel, The Halflife of Evil, will be published by Spencer Books in June 2018. It is about Maud Lewis, the provincial Poor Farm, and the policies of imprisonment of the poor. =Maud Lewis= Woolaver is best known for his works on the life and art of Maud Lewis. He wrote a picture book of Maud‚Äôs life, The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis (1996), with photographs of Maud and her works by Bob Brooks. It has been in continuous print since being published. The cover image of Maud Lewis in the sunny corner of her tiny house has been recognized as a classic portrait, said to rank with the work of Yousuf Karsh. Maud Lewis - World Without Shadows, his play about Maud Lewis and her husband Everett Lewis, has been produced across Canada and broadcast by CBC radio. It tells of Maud‚Äôs struggle against juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and triumph as an artist, despite poverty. Canadian actor Nicola Lipman played Maud to great acclaim in the 1990s Ship‚Äôs Company Theatre and Neptune Theatre productions. His play The Return of Her Child deals with issues related to the adoption of Maud Lewis's daughter Catherine by Mamie Crosby. Woolaver's recent full biography, Maud Lewis The Heart on the Door (2016), features another Brooks' portrait of the artist, taken in 1965, in which Lewis appears frightened and fearful. This is appropriate to the darker tone of this work, as Woolaver explores many issues in her life. His account contrasts also with the portrayal of Lewis in the independent feature drama film, Maudie. =The Outlaw League / La Gang des Hors la Loi = The Outlaw League (1991) is a young adult novel, which Woolaver set in his home town of Digby, Nova Scotia. It explores the role of baseball in bringing the people of the village together. Woolaver refers to childhood friends in his book, and to former Digby baseball teams, including the Digby Ravens, the Bear River Blue Sox, and the Freeport Schooners. The novel was adapted as a 2014 film, La Gang des Hors la Loi, produced by Rock Demers of Productions La Fete, from a script by Andr√© Melan√ßon, Jean Beaudry, and Woolaver. Honours and awards *2003, Maud Lewis - World Without Shadows won the Merritt Award as Nova Scotia‚Äôs outstanding play. =Books= Woolaver wrote the following: *Maud Lewis The Heart on the Door (2016), Spencer Books, *The Poor Farm (1999), Charles Press, *with Bob Brooks, photographer.

His designs, celebrated as ground breaking, ushered in a new era of lighthouse creation. He served as president of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts (1859‚Äì60), as president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1884-86), and was a co-founder of the Scottish Meteorological Society. Life He was born at 2 Baxters PlaceEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1818 in Edinburgh, on 22 July 1818, the youngest son of engineer Robert Stevenson, and his wife (and step-sister) Jean Smith. He was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh. Thomas Stevenson was a devout and regular attendee at St. Stephen's Church in Stockbridge, at the north end of St Vincent Street, Edinburgh. He lived with his family at Baxters Place until he got married in 1848. He then got a house at 8 Howard Place.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1850 By 1855 he moved to 1 Inverleith Terrace.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1855 From at least 1860 he lived at 17 Heriot Row, a large Georgian terraced townhouse in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1860 In 1869, as a successful experiment into using the newly invented electric light for lighthouses, Stevenson had an underwater cable installed from the eastern part of Granton Harbour, and a light on the end of the Trinity Chain Pier was controlled from half a mile away by an operator on the harbour. He examined wind and wave effects, and his analysis Stevenson, T. The Design and Construction of Harbors: A Treatise on Maritime Engineering, seconded. Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh is the first quantitative discussion of wave height as a (square root) function of fetch. His paper Stevenson, T. (1880) Report on Simultaneous Observations of the Force of Wind at Different Heights above the Ground, Journal of the Scottish Meteorological Society, LI-LIV, pp.103‚Äì107 is one of the first quantitative studies of wind speeds in the planetary boundary layer. Motivated by practical applications, these are fundamental contributions. He designed the Stevenson screen as a shelter to shield meteorological instruments, and this has been widely adopted. He died at 17 Heriot Row in Edinburgh on 8 May 1887 and is buried in the Stevenson family vault in New Calton Cemetery. The vault lies midway along the eastern wall. Family He was brother of the lighthouse engineers Alan and David Stevenson, between 1854 and 1886 he designed many lighthouses, with his brother David, and then with David's son David Alan Stevenson. He married Margaret Isabella \\"Maggie\\" Balfour in 1848, daughter of Rev. Lewis Balfour. Their son was the writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who caused him much disappointment by failing to follow the engineering interests of his family. His wife's younger brother, James Melville Balfour (i.e. his brother-in-law), trained under D. & T. Stevenson and then emigrated to New Zealand, where he was first the marine engineer for Otago Province before he appointed Colonial Marine Engineer.

Sent to the Pacific Ocean to search for the CSS Alabama, Wyoming eventually came upon the shores of Japan and engaged Japanese land and sea forces. On 16 July 1863, Wyoming won the first-ever United States naval victory over Japan in the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits. Service history The ship was laid down at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in July 1858, launched on 19 January 1859, sponsored by Mary Florida Grice, and commissioned in October 1859, Commander John K. Mitchell in command. She was named for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, not the state of Wyoming which did not yet exist. =West Coast, 1859-1862= Wyoming soon sailed via Cape Horn for the Pacific and arrived off the coast of Nicaragua in April 1860. There, she relieved and operated along the Pacific coast of the United States and Central America into the spring of 1861. During that time, she participated in the search for Levant when that warship disappeared in the late autumn of 1860. The outbreak of the Civil War found Wyoming at San Francisco, California, preparing for another cruise. She was instructed to remain in the vicinity of the Golden Gate to protect mail steamers operating off the California coast, but CDR Mitchell -- a naval officer of Southern origin and persuasion -- defied his orders and took his ship to Panama instead. Mitchell's flagrant disobedience cost him his command and also resulted in his dismissal from the service. As a result, Wyoming came under the temporary command of her executive officer, Lt. Francis K. Murray, on 4 July 1861. While returning to Monterey, California, Wyoming was plagued by mishaps. First, her bottom struck a coral head off La Paz, Baja California Sur, and was pulled free only after three days aground during which she lost her false keel. She then ran short of coal and arrived at Monterey with empty bunkers. Wyoming subsequently shifted to San Francisco where, on 9 August, she received a new commanding officer, Commander David McDougal. The warship then proceeded to the coast of Lower California to protect American whaling interests against possible incursions by Confederate cruisers. After that service, she operated in South American waters into 1862. =Far East, 1862-1863= Following repairs at Mare Island, Wyoming received orders -- dated 16 June 1862 -- to proceed immediately to the Far East in search of \\"armed piratical cruisers fitted out by the rebels\\" and soon headed west, bound for the Orient. Word of the Union ship's subsequent appearance in Far Eastern waters spread fast and far. In the Sunda Strait, off Java, Captain Raphael Semmes, the commanding officer of Confederate cruiser Alabama, learned from an English brig of Wyoming's arrival in the East Indies; and a Dutch trader later confirmed this report. On 26 October, Semmes wrote confidently in his journal that \\"Wyoming is a good match for this ship,\\" and \\"I have resolved to give her battle. She is reported to be cruising under sail -- probably with banked fires -- and anchors, no doubt, under Krakatoa every night, and I hope to surprise her, the moon being near its full.\\" Although in their search for each other, Wyoming and Alabama unknowingly came close to each other, they never met; and it would be up to another Union warship, the sloop , to destroy the elusive Confederate raider. Yet, despite being unsuccessful in tracking down Confederate cruisers, Wyoming did render important service to uphold the honor of the American flag in the Far East the following year, 1863. Ordered to Philadelphia that spring -- after what had been a largely fruitless cruise -- Wyoming was in the midst of preparations to leave the East Indies when an event occurred that changed her plans. =The Battle of the Straits of Shimonoseki, 1863= On 10 May 1863, Wyoming at Yokohama, Japan. Attempts by to refloat her were unsuccessful as the tide was falling. She was refloated the next day and taken in to Yokohama. Wyoming was stationed there as a show of force, standing by to protect American lives and property during an outbreak of anti-foreign agitation in Japan. Nevertheless, that agitation continued into the early summer months, as the sonn≈ç j≈çi movement grew in strength with increasing resentment by the Japanese to the terms of the recent unequal treaties signed with the western powers. Emperor K≈çmei issued a decree setting 25 June 1863 as the date for the expulsion of all aliens from Japan. Although the Tokugawa shogunate was largely powerless to force compliance with this directive, the powerful pro-sonn≈ç j≈çi daimy≈ç of Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, the M≈çri Takachika took the decree literally and decided to attack foreign ships passing through the Straits of Shimonoseki, which the domain regarded as part of its territory. At one o'clock on the morning of 26 June, two armed vessels of Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain attacked the American merchantman Pembroke, bound for Nagasaki and Shanghai, as she lay anchored in the Strait of Shimonoseki. Pembroke suffered no casualties; got underway; and moved out of danger, escaping via Bungo Strait and continuing her voyage for Shanghai, post-haste, without making her scheduled stop at Nagasaki. Word of the incident did not reach Yokohama from Japanese sources until 10 July. That evening, mail from Shanghai brought \\"authentic information\\" confirming the Japanese report. The United States Minister in Japan, Robert H. Pruyn, sent for the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Japanese government and informed him -- in the presence of Comdr. McDougal -- of the gravity of the situation, stressing that an insult to the American flag was a serious matter. After being told by Pruyn that the United States government would demand satisfaction and expect a statement from the Japanese concerning the offense, the Japanese diplomat begged that the Americans do nothing until his government at Edo took action. After the Japanese left, McDougal told Pruyn that he had decided to proceed instantly to the Shimonoseki Strait to seize and, if necessary, to destroy, the offending vessels. The two men agreed that lack of punitive action would encourage further anti-foreign incidents. Wyoming battling in the Shimonoseki Straits. Accordingly, Wyoming prepared for sea. At 4:45 a.m. on 13 July, CDR McDougal called all hands; and the sloop got underway 15 minutes later, bound for the strait. After a two-day voyage, Wyoming arrived off the island of Himeshima on the evening of 15 July and anchored off the south side of that island. At five o'clock the following morning, Wyoming weighed anchor and steamed toward the Strait of Shimonoseki. She went to general quarters at nine, loaded her pivot guns with shell, and cleared for action. The warship entered the strait at 10:45 and beat to quarters. Soon, three signal guns boomed from the landward, alerting the Ch≈çsh≈´ coastal artillery batteries and warships of Wyoming's arrival. At about 11:15, after being fired upon from the shore batteries, Wyoming hoisted her colors and replied with her 11-inch pivot guns. Momentarily ignoring the batteries, McDougal ordered Wyoming to continue steaming toward a bark, a steamer, and a brig at anchor off the town of Shimonoseki. Meanwhile, four shore batteries took the warship under fire. Wyoming answered the Japanese cannon \\"as fast as the guns could be brought to bear\\" while shells from the shore guns passed through her rigging. Wyoming then passed between the brig and the bark on the starboard hand and the steamer on the port, steaming within a pistol shot's range. One shot from either the bark or brig struck near Wyoming's forward broadside gun, killing two men and wounding four. Elsewhere on the ship, a Marine was struck dead by a piece of shrapnel. Wyoming, in hostile territory, then grounded in uncharted waters shortly after she had made one run past the forts. The Japanese steamer, in the meantime, had slipped her cable and headed directly for Wyoming -- possibly to attempt a boarding. The American man-of-war, however, managed to work free of the mud and then unleashed her 11-inch Dahlgren guns on the enemy ship, hulling and damaging her severely. Two well-directed shots exploded her boilers and, as she began to sink, her crew abandoned the ship. Wyoming then passed the bark and the brig, firing into them steadily and methodically. Some shells were \\"overs\\" and landed in the town ashore, setting it on fire. As Comdr. McDougal wrote in his report to Gideon Welles on 23 July, \\"the punishment inflicted (upon the daimyo) and in store for him will, I trust, teach him a lesson that will not soon be forgotten.\\" After having been in combat for a little over an hour, Wyoming returned to Yokohama. She had been hulled 11 times, with considerable damage to her smokestack and rigging. Her casualties had been comparatively light: four men killed and seven wounded -- one of whom later died. Significantly, Wyoming had been the first foreign warship to take offensive action to uphold treaty rights in Japan. =Hunting the raiders, 1863-1864= However, the ship's projected return to Philadelphia did not materialize due to the supposed continued presence of Alabama in Far Eastern waters. She repaired her damages, resumed the search and sailed to the Dutch East Indies. She subsequently voyaged to Christmas Island, examining it to determine whether or not it was used as a supply base for \\"the use of rebel cruisers.\\" Finding the island uninhabited and the report of its use as a supply base unfounded, Wyoming returned to Anjer, Java, where McDougal found out, to his surprise, that Alabama had passed the Sunda Strait on 10 November -- only a day after Wyoming had sailed for Christmas Island. At noon that day, Alabama and Wyoming had been only 25 miles apart. Writing from Batavia on 22 November, McDougal later reported that Wyoming had scoured the waters of the East Indies, visiting \\"every place in this neighborhood where she (Alabama) would likely lay in case she intended to remain in this region.\\" Although acknowledging that the condition of Wyoming's boilers prevented a heavy pressure of steam from being carried, McDougal promised to make every effort in his power to find and capture Alabama. Wyoming then cruised to Singapore in search of the Confederate raider, but found nothing, and continued on to the Dutch settlement of Rhio, near Sunda Strait. She subsequently sailed north, putting into Cavite, Luzon, in the Philippine Islands, on Christmas Eve. There, through the courtesy of the Spanish Navy, Wyoming underwent much-needed boiler repairs and coaled. She then sailed for Hong Kong and Whampoa, China. Wyoming continued her search for the elusive Alabama into February 1864. She sailed to Foochow, China, to protect American interests and proceeded thence, via Hong Kong, to the East Indies. When the sloop-of-war reached Batavia, however, CDR McDougal found that there was now no alternative but to return to the United States for repairs, because the ship's boilers were in such poor condition. Accordingly, Wyoming began her long-delayed return voyage to the United States, via Anjer, the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and St. Thomas. After a voyage of almost three months, she arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 13 July 1864; having completed a circumnavigation of the globe begun when she left that port following her commissioning. The presence of CSS Florida off the East Coast, however, meant another change in plans for the weary Wyoming. Commodore Cornelius Stribling, Commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, ordered the newly arrived screw sloop to sea to search for Florida. \\"It is with regret that I send you on this service,\\" Stribling wrote McDougal, \\"After so long a cruise, and one in which you have rendered such important service, yourself, officers and crew, were entitled to a respite from active service; but the great importance of capturing the rebel privateer will, I hope, be an incentive to all under your command cheerfully to perform this service.\\" Although Wyoming required extensive repairs, she nevertheless sailed. As events proved, however, Wyoming's machinery -- so long from repairs in an American Navy Yard -- proved unequal to the strain. For five days, the ship attempted to carry out the orders given her -- contending with fresh northeast winds and a head sea -- but returned to Philadelphia on 19 July, due to a leaky boiler. She was decommissioned on 23 July for a complete overhaul. =East Indies Station, 1865-1868= Recommissioned on 11 April 1865, Comdr. John P. Bankhead in command, Wyoming proceeded to the East Indies Station, via Cape Horn, and reached Singapore on 25 September 1865, in time to participate in the search for CSS Shenandoah, a Confederate raider which remained at sea for one month after the end of the Civil War. Following service on the East Indies Station into 1866, the screw sloop-of-war was made part of the Asiatic Squadron with that unit's establishment in 1867. Sailing from Yokohama on 28 April 1867, Wyoming headed for the island of Formosa (Taiwan). On 13 June, she participated in a punitive expedition against Formosan natives who had murdered the crew of the American merchant bark Rover that had been wrecked off the coast of Formosa a short time before. During that action, she sent a landing party ashore in company with one from the sloop . Subsequently, returning to the United States having performed her last service in the Far East, Wyoming was decommissioned on 10 February 1868 and placed \\"in ordinary\\" at Boston, Massachusetts. After extensive repairs at Portsmouth Navy Yard, during 1870 and into 1871, Wyoming was recommissioned on 14 November 1871, Comdr. John L. Davis in command. =North Atlantic Station, 1872-1878= From 1872 to 1874, Wyoming operated on the North Atlantic Station. Her ports of call included Havana, Cuba; Key West, Florida.; Aspinwall, Panama; Santiago, Cuba; Kingston, Jamaica; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Key West; Hampton Roads, Va.; and New Bedford, Mass. After that tour of duty, cruising and \\"showing the flag\\" in the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico, Wyoming was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 30 April 1874 and remained laid up there for the next two years. In 1876, the Wyoming was deployed to the Potomac river in order to defend Washington DC at rumors of an invasion by Southern separatists after the controversial election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden. The veteran screw sloop-of-war became the receiving ship at Washington in 1877 and apparently served in that capacity into early the following year. Recommissioned on 20 November 1877, Wyoming left Washington, loaded articles for the Paris Exposition, and departed the East Coast of the United States on 6 April 1878, bound for France. After discharging the cargo at Le Havre, France, the ship visited Rouen, France, and Southampton, England, before she departed the latter port on 25 June and headed for the United States. She reached Norfolk on 22 August, shifted to Washington in mid-September, and to New York in early November, before she sailed on 26 November for the European Station. =European Station, 1878-1881= Wyoming reached Villefranche, France, near the port of Nice, on Christmas Eve 1878 and remained there into 1879 before getting underway for Smyrna on 24 January 1879. Wyoming remained in the Mediterranean into November 1880, touching at many of the more famous ports in that historic body of water -- and in the Black Sea -- before heading home late in 1880. Wyoming returned to the United States in early 1881, arriving at Hampton Roads on 21 May. She sailed for Beaufort, S.C., on 15 June and thence proceeded to Annapolis, Md. =Naval Academy, 1882-1892= Decommissioned on 30 October 1882 and turned over to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, Wyoming spent the next decade employed as a practice ship for midshipmen. Later taken to Norfolk, Va., she was sold at the port on 9 May 1892 to E. J. Butler, of Arlington, Massachusetts.

Life Stevenson was born in Edinburgh on 28 April 1807, the eldest son of Jean Smith and her husband (and step-brother) Robert Stevenson.http://robert-louis-stevenson.org/lighthouses/ With his father, and brothers David and Thomas, he was part of the notable family of Engineers and lighthouse builders. The writer Robert Louis Stevenson was his nephew. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh. In 1821, he attended the University of Edinburgh to study Latin, Greek and mathematics with a view to becoming a member of the clergy. However, 2 years later in 1823, he decided to pursue a career in engineering and began a four-year apprenticeship at his father's business. He continued to study part-time at the University and graduated with an MA in 1926. Between 1843 and 1853 he built 13 lighthouses in and around Scotland. Among his notable works is the Skerryvore Lighthouse. He was Engineer in Chief to the Northern Lighthouse Board from 1843 to 1853. In 1838 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being James David Forbes. In 1840 the University of Glasgow conferred on him an honorary LLB degree.

Cathkin Park is a municipal park in Glasgow, Scotland. The park is maintained by the city's parks department, and it is a public place where football is still played. The park contains the site of the second Hampden Park, previously home to the football clubs Queen's Park (from 1884‚Äì1903) and Third Lanark (from 1903‚Äì1967). The original Hampden Park is just to the west, as the course of the original Cathcart Road is now in Queen's Park Rec. Football ground The park formerly contained a football stadium, which had played host to organised football since 1884. It was originally known as Hampden Park (the second by that name, succeeding the original Hampden Park) and was rented by Queen's Park between 1884 and 1903. When Queen's Park moved to the third (and current) Hampden Park, Third Lanark took over the lease. They renamed it New Cathkin Park (as they had previously played at another stadium named Cathkin Park just to the east of Dixon Halls on the east side of the Cathcart Road (which had held two internationals; the first, on 15 March 1884, Scotland versus England, was the first all-ticket match). This is also where the first major Anglo- Scottish club competition, the British League Cup final, took place (att: 12000) in 1902, which Celtic won against Rangers 3‚Äì2 after extra time. Third Lanark's last match at Cathkin took place on 25 April 1967, when they played out a 3-3 draw against Queen of the South. Jimmy Davidson scored one goal for Queens and Brian McMurdo two, including the last ever senior football goal at the Park (the Thirds goals came from Kinnaird with two goals and McLaughlan with the other). A Glasgow Challenge Cup Final was played at Cathkin on 13 May 1967 between two Junior sides, Cambuslang Rangers and Rutherglen Glencairn (Cambuslang winning 2-0); this was the final football match played at Cathkin before Third Lanark folded later that year. The final goal to be scored at Cathkin came from Cambuslang Rangers forward Peter Coleman after 17 minutes. The stadium subsequently fell into disrepair and most of the fabric was gradually removed. The remains of the terraces from 3 sides of the ground can be seen in the park. However, a reformed Third Lanark team, which plays in the Greater Glasgow Amateur League, currently plays in the park,Third Lanark Athletic Club Greater Glasgow Amateur League as do Hampden AFC and boys team the Jimmy Johnstone Academy.

It was a subsidiary of the German Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) until 1909. Early history In 1890, Eduard Bierenz was appointed as Austrian retailer. The company sold so well that it also began manufacturing the automobiles after uniting with Eduard Fischer's engineering factory. The works were located at Wiener-Neustadt. By this subsidiary DMG became the first automotive multinational in history. Thus on August 11, 1899, the Austrian Daimler Engine Society was founded. Whilst the assembling parts stemmed from Stuttgart, in 1900 they built their first automobile which featured 2 cylinders, , and 4 seats. Soon they started producing engines for luxurious cars, trucks, buses, maritime ships, and trains. =Paul Daimler era= Austro-Daimler 4x4 four-wheel-drive Armoured Car (1904) In 1902, Paul Daimler, Gottlieb Daimler's son, took charge of the Technical Department. He developed a compact car (8 hp, 45 km/h). In 1905 he built the company's first armoured car, which had . Also, the company produced engines for both trucks and buses. However, Daimler returned to Stuttgart in 1905 to take over the research and development department, which had been vacated by Maybach. =Ferdinand Porsche era= Senior Ferdinand Porsche took Daimler's place as technical designer. Although Austro-Daimler cars were competing at races already, Porsche pioneered aerodynamic usage with two famous racecars (Mixte and Maya). Also, he designed the Merc√©d√®s-Electrique-Mixte which was manufactured from 1902 until 1907. Porsche also impelled a company reformation, at a time when the company had 800 workers. The company was renamed 'Austro-Daimler' on July 27, 1906. That same year Emil Jellinek -- who was Austrian too -- bought several Austro-Daimler licenses to found ancillary companies abroad. In 1908, the Austro-Daimler began producing Zeppelin engines. Indeed, for Porsche this was a personal interest since he liked to take Archduke Franz Ferdinand flying over Vienna. Pushing the company's development further, Porsche granted Austro-Daimler's definitive independence from DMG's ownership in 1909. In 1910, the company was renamed Oesterreichische Daimler Motoren AG (Austrian Daimler Engines AG) whose logo was the Austrian Royal double-headed eagle. In 1912 DMG sold its remaining shares. In 1911 Austro-Daimler began producing the Prinz Heinrich (in English: Prince Henry) model; this car, which featured an overhead cam 5,714-cc four-cylinder engine, quickly became famous. It could develop 95 bhp at 2,100 rpm; there was also a less potent version with side valves and a 6,900-cc engine capable of developing at only 1,200 rpm. Both designs were by Porsche. =WW I= Striking workers from Austro-Daimler assembling outside the Town Hall, Wiener Neustadt, 18 January 1918 During the First World War, the 4,500 workers of Austro-Daimler contributed in large quantities to wartime production. They played a key role in the 1918 Austro- Hungarian January Strike in which workers inspired by the Bolshevik seizure of power took strike action to oppose the war. A key factor in the strike was the halving of the flour ration. Porsche met the workers and agreed to drive to Vienna to speak to the Minister of Food. However, his plea to the workers to return to work was ignored and they marched on the Town Hall. Here they were joined by other workers from the locomotive factory, the radiator works, the aircraft factory and local ammunition plants of G. Rath and the Lichtenw√∂rther. The assembly soon numbered over 10,000 and the Stadtholder phoned the Volksern√§hrungsamt - the state organisation managing food supply. However, the minister, General Anton H√∂fer only promised to meet a delegation of the workers. The strike spread across the empire and involved over 700,000 workers. =1920‚Äì1930s= Share of the Oesterreichische Daimler Motoren AG, issued 22. September 1921 After the war, the company returned to the production of automobiles. Austro-Daimler still claimed Royal patronage via its connection with Prince Heinrich. Soon, the company began collapsing. In the first place, Austro-Daimler fused with several companies -- Skoda, Fiat, and Puch (1928). Then, it was submerged under Camillo Castiglioni's squandering management. At this time, Porsche created the 1.3-liter \\"Sascha\\" racing cars (named after their backer, Count Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowski) in the early 1920s. The smallest model the company offered was a 2,212-cc four- cylinder. However, as the economic situation worsened, Porsche abandoned the company in 1923, ridding himself of Austro-Daimler's financial difficulties. Instead, he moved to Stuttgart's DMG. Austro-Daimler ADR 8 Pullman (1932). The outstanding production car offered by Austro-Daimler during the 1930s was the ADM, which featured overhead cam six-cylinder engines of 2,540 cc, 2,650 cc, and 2,994 cc. The last-named (the ADM III) developed at 4,000 rpm and was one of the greatest automobiles of the decade. Also offered was a less luxurious sporting version, the ADR. 1931 saw Austro-Daimler introduce a 4,624-cc eight- cylinder car, a superb, highly expensive luxury vehicle. The last great car built at the Austrian works was the six-cylinder \\"Bergmeister\\", which featured an overhead cam 3,614-cc engine that could develop at 3,600 rpm; this car had a top speed of . In 1934 the company merged with Steyr Automobile, creating the Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate. However, in this same year, Austro- Daimler was dissolved. =Postwar era= In the 1970s and into the 1980s bicycles were made by Steyr-Daimler-Puch with some models bearing the Puch trademark, and more upscale models bearing the Austro-Daimler trademark. When the bicycle manufacturing aspects of the consortium were sold in 1987 to Piaggio & C. S.p.A. of Italy, the Puch trademark was conveyed however, the rights to the name Austro-Daimler were not sold. Since then no bicycles have been made bearing this trademark.

Early life and career Tupper was born on a farm in Berlin, New Hampshire. The Tupper family moved from Berlin when he was three years old. After studying at Bryant College (now Bryant University) in Providence, Rhode Island, he began a landscaping and nursery business until the Great Depression forced the business into bankruptcy. He then got a job with the DuPont chemical company. Creation of Tupperware An example of Tupperware Using black, inflexible pieces of polyethylene slag, a waste product of the oil refining process given to him by his supervisor at DuPont, Tupper purified the slag and molded it to create lightweight, non-breakable containers, cups, bowls, plates, and even gas masks that were used in World War II. He later designed liquid-proof, airtight lids, inspired by the secure seal of paint can lids. Business Tupper founded the Tupperware Plastics Company in 1938, and in 1948 the company introduced Tupper Plastics to hardware and department stores. Around 1946, he joined forces with Brownie Wise, who caught his attention after she made a lengthy phone call to his office in South Grafton, Massachusetts, during which she explained her extraordinary success selling Tupperware via home parties. Based on a marketing strategy developed by Wise and early pioneers Tom and Ann Damigella from Everett, Massachusetts, Tupperware was withdrawn from sale in retail stores in the early 1950s and Tupperware \\"parties\\" soon became popular in homes. This was the first instance of what became known as \\"party plan\\" marketing. The corporate headquarters was moved from Massachusetts to Orlando, Florida. After his falling-out with Wise, which resulted in her dismissal in 1958, Tupper sold The Tupperware Company for $16 million to Rexall. Shortly afterward, he divorced his wife, gave up his U.S. citizenship to avoid taxes, and bought an island just off the coast of Costa Rica.Tupper Philanthropy In 1969, Tupper donated 428 acres of land in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to his alma mater, Bryant College (now named Bryant University). The land was developed into the college's new campus, which opened in 1971. Death Tupper died in Costa Rica on October 5, 1983, at the age of 76. References External links * Earl S.

Upon receipt, the brokerage uses a custodian connected to the international stock exchange for selling the depositary receipts.

The party was founded as the Communist League by Saumyendranath Tagore in 1934, breaking away from the Communist Party of India (CPI). RCPI led armed uprisings after the independence of India, but later shifted to parliamentary politics. The party is active in the West Bengal and Assam. The party was represented in the West Bengal Second United Front Cabinet (1969) as well as in various state government during the Left Front rule in the state (1977‚Äì2011). In Assam the party won four Legislative Assembly seats in 1978, but its political influence has since declined. Ideology The RCPI works toward a socialist revolution, rather than a people's democratic revolution, a national democratic revolution or a new democratic revolution. The party strives to build socialism under the leadership of the proletariat with active cooperation of other exploited strata of the humanity, including peasants, working intellectuals and non- manual working sections of people. Communist League S.N. Tagore founded the Communist League on 1 August 1934.Partido de los Trabajadores Socialistas. Origenes y formacion del trotskismo en India y Ceilan Tagore was a communist leader from Bengal who had attended the 1928 Sixth Congress of the Communist International, and had stayed in Europe for seven years afterwards. He toured the continent on behalf of the League Against Imperialism. At the 1928 Communist International congress Tagore had sought to challenge the role of M.N. Roy in the organization. Tagore had turned hostile towards Stalin, possibly as in reaction to his failed bid to gain recognition from the Communist International in 1928. On his return to India in 1934 he appealed to CPI to abandon its ultra-left line. Albeit CPI would later moderate its positions after the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, Tagore broke with CPI and founded his own communist group (the Communist League). In May 1934 Tagore set up an 'initiative committee' for the founding of the new party. Other founders of the Communist League included Sudhir Dasgupta, Prabhat Sen, Ranjit Majumdar and Arun Banerjee. Tagore denounced the Popular Front line of CPI, rejecting the Congress Socialist Party. In Tagore's view the CSP represented an alliance between socialists and reactionary elements of the bourgeoise. Communist League and the peasantry After the formation of the Communist League Tagore began touring the Bengal country-side, organizing peasants to struggle for abolishing the zamindari system. In early 1938 Tagore built a peasants wing, the Bangiyo Pradeshik Kisan Sabha, separate from the CPI-led Krishak Samiti. Tagore's BPKS demanded abolition of the zamindari system without giving any compensation to landlords, free distribution of land among the cultivators and agricultural labourers, minimization of revenue demands and cancellation of debts to moneylenders. Communist League in Murshidabad Tarapada Gupta set up the Communist League branch in Murshidabad in 1936, raising the red flag for the first time in recorded history in the district. Tarapada Gupta had been released from jail in 1935, and he established contact with Tagore's group.Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies. Saumyendranath Tagore and the Peasant Movement of Murshidabad: A Study on Historical Perspectives The Communist League preceded both the CPI and the RSP in Murshidabad. The party successfully organized peasants to refuse to pay rents to landlords in the area. Gupta would later side with Tagore in the 1948 party split. Tagore in Assam RCPI was the first left organization to established itself in Assam. RCPI built a student movement in Assam. In 1937 a Radical Club was formed at Cotton College, under the cover of the and with Haren Kalita as its leader. In November 1938 Tagore visited Assam and met with a group of students and youth. His visit was organized by the Congressman Debranath Sarma. A Communist League branch was formed in the province in 1939, with several of the Cotton College students as its members. Students who became members of the Communist League included Haren Kalita, Haridas Deka, Tarunsen Deka, Upen Sarma, Ananda Chandra Das, Taracharan Majumdar, Gokul Medhi, Arabinda Ghosh, Loknath Barua, Umakanta Sarma, Bhupen Mahanta, N. Buragohain, Khagendranath Barbarua, Uma Sarma and Kamini Goswami. The students would later contest, and eventually win, the Cotton College Students Union through the Assam Provincial Students Federation. Tagore made a second visit to Assam in December 1941. This time he visited Khagen Barbarua at his village in Upper Assam and discussed building the party organization in the province. Tagore was expelled from Assam on 18 December 1941. The Assam Provincial Student Federation, which was under the influence of RCPI supported the Quit India movement. On 2 May 1940 the Krishak Banuva Panchayat was formed in Gauhati as the open front group of the party in Assam. Kedarnath Goswami was the first president of KBP, a former Congressman and labour organizer. The basic unit of KBP was the Gaon Krishak Panchayat ('Village Peasants Council'). The Assamese folk singer Bishnu Prasad Rabha joined KBP in 1945. In 1949 he became a RCPI member. As the Indian National Congress dominated the tea gardens of Assam and there was little industrial labour in the province, the Communist League instead sought to organize rice mill workers, horse cart drivers and steamboat labourers. The efforts had meagre results. Notably RCPI made no intents to build the party in the hill areas of Assam. RCPI and the World War The party was organized along Leninist lines with party cells at the bottom of the party hierarchy and the Central Committee as its leadership. In preparation of the impending World War, the party developed a three-tier leadership structure in order for the party to survive under waves of repression. The third tier was entirely clandestine, prepared to take over the party affairs after arrests of the first two tiers. The party raised the slogan \\"Not one paisa, not one man for war\\". On 4 September 1939 Tagore issued a declaration, labelling the war as an imperialist conflict and called on the Indian workers to turn the imperialist war into civil war. Tagore was arrested and jailed under the Defence of India Act immediately afterwards. With Tagore in jail, Pannalal Dasgupta became general secretary of the party. He toured Assam, Bombay, Madras and Bengal. During the Second World War, peasants influenced by the party were instructed not to sell rice for exportation. In 1941 the Third Party Conference of the Communist League of India changed its name to Communist Party of India (not to be confused with its far more well- known namesake). In March 1943 the name RCPI was adopted, in order to differentiate itself from the CPI. The party positioned itself claiming to be the sole true leftist party in the country, denouncing all other left forces as ideologically bankrupt. Overall RCPI avoided collaboration with other left- wing groups. RCPI labour organizing was done largely outside the All India Trade Union Congress. It managed to build a core of political cadres and was active building a labour movement amongst workers at the jute mills in the Beliaghata-Narkeldanga area of Calcutta. The party was often referred to as the 'Tagorites' or as the 'Ganavani group' (after the name of its publication). RCPI differed with CPI on tactical questions during the Second World War. RCPI denounced the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact as well as declaring the Soviet war with Finland as 'imperialist'. The RCPI fully supported the Quit India movement. The party sought to develop the Quit India movement into a revolutionary upheaval. Most of the known party leaders were arrested, and would remain in detention until the end of the Second World War. Through the Radical Institute, RCPI promoted dissemination of locally produced weaponry to use against British government forces in Assam. In the \\"Red Front\\", in October 1942, Saumyendranath Tagore wrote: > The conclusions that we draw from the Quit India movement are the following: > First, the utter bankruptcy of the Congress, the party of the Indian > bourgeoisie and its total inability to lead the national movement. Secondly, > the complete overthrow of non-violence as a technique of struggle. Thirdly, > the complete exposure of the National Frontists, the legal Communists, the > germ-carriers of anti-revolutionary Stalinism. Fourthly, the rapid > revolutionisation of the masses. Fifthly, the ripening of the ideological > premises for the growth of real leftism as a result of the political > development, both national and international. The national revolution in > India has definitely jumped over the hurdles of Gandhism and has scornfully > rejected the petty bourgeois Congress Socialism which is at the service of > the Indian bourgeoisie. It has thoroughly exposed the legal communist > traitors of the Stalinist and the Royist brand. Only the political line of > the Revolutionary Communist Party stands fully vindicated by the development > and march of the national revolutionary movement. In 1945 RCPI raised two key slogans in Assam, 'land to the tiller' (nangal jar mati tar) and 'one third share' (tin bhag), slogans which became very popular amongst landless peasants and agricultural labourers. KBP was able to make some inroads amongst these sectors. Some Tribal League leaders in Assam, such as Aniram Basumatari and Daben Khaklari, became RCPI members in the mid-1940s. Their presence in the party helped it to make inroads amongst the tribals in Assam. Independence and Partition As the departure of British colonial rule came closer, RCPI denounced the negotiated independence as a joint conspiracy between British imperialism and the Indian bourgeoisie. RCPI stated that Independence obtained in 1947 was a false one. Rejecting the official process for independence, RCPI began organizing panchayats (i.e. soviets) of workers and peasants in order to convene a Workers and Peasants Constituent Assembly. RCPI denounced the Partition of India as betrayal and surrender to British imperialism. There was a strong Hindu chauvinist trend within RCPI, as alleged by Charles W. Ervin. RCPI opposed the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India, which wanted to place Assam into the Muslim-majority grouping of provinces. According to Salkia, through its opposition to the Cabinet Mission grouping RCPI was able to carve out \\"a niche for itself in the mainstream politics of Assam\\". In 1946 RCPI discussed a possible merger with the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma. The RCPI delegation in the talks consisted of Sudhir Dasgupta, Tarapada Gupta, and Gour Pal. Nevertheless, the merger discussion didn't go through. RCPI refused to join the Fourth International. The BLPI discarded the RCPI line of organizing soviets as a premature move. In September 1947 RCPI and BLPI collaborated to build a United Workers Front to challenge the Congress-led trade unions.Cahiers Leon Trotsky, February 1998 In December 1947 Tagore was elected president of the All India Bank Employees Association, at its conference held in Lucknow.Syndicate Bank Employees Union (Regd). Looking Back Tagore‚ÄìDasgupta split Tagore was jailed in November 1947. Tagore was released from prison in 1948. After his release from jail Tagore argued that armed revolution was premature in India. But a sector of the party, led by Pannalal Dasgupta, insisted on turning the campaign of building panchayats into a general armed insurrection. Dasgupta assembled an All India Party Conference in Birbhum in 1948. Tagore requested to resign from the RCPI Central Committee, a request the Birbhum conference rejected. After the Birbhum conference the followers of Dasgupta began to gather arms and prepare for armed struggle. The developments inside RCPI had an echo in the CPI. Dasgupta's view that India was ripe for armed revolution coincided with the position of the new CPI leader B.T. Ranadive. After the Birbhum conference Tagore, at a public meeting in Calcutta, denounced insurrectional line of Dasgupta. Tagore's speech pushed the Dasgupta group to issue disciplinary action against him, accepting his resignation from the Central Committee. Half a year later Tagore gathered his followers for a separate Party Conference, as its 5th Party Congress, in Burdwan. Thus there were two parallel RCPIs, one led by Dasgupta and one led by Tagore. Dasgupta represented the majority group in the split. It was sometimes known as 'RCPI (Rebel Group)' or as 'RCPI (Dasgupta)'. The Tagore-led party was known as 'RCPI (Tagore)'. 26 February 1949 terrorist attacks On 26 February 1949 the Dasgupta-led RCPI initiated its armed revolt. They attacked the Dum Dum Airfield, Jessop & Company and the Dum Dum Gun and Shell Factory. At the Jessop plant equipment was stolen. Several persons were killed or injured in the attacks. At the Dum Dum Gun and Shell Factory the sentry was shot. The British manager at Jessup was thrown into a furnace, as were two other Europeans. Another European was stabbed, and later died. At Dum Dum Airfield a plane was set on fire and seven rifles stolen. The militants then moved towards Basirhat. On Jessore Road they attacked the Gouripour Police Post. At Basirhat they attacked a police station, killing two guards and stealing 26 rifles. The militants attempted to flee into East Pakistan. Eventually the group was caught as police reinforcements arrived from Calcutta. A police inspector was killed during the gun fight. Only two of the attackers managed to escape arrest. 39 RCPI cadres were arrested, including Dasgupta himself. They were held without trial for 4‚Äì5 years, and then sentenced to jail. Dasgupta himself was sentenced to imprisonment for life. After the 1949 revolt, the party cast away its line of insurrectional politics. Whilst RCPI acted from underground, no formal ban was placed on the party. Assam insurgency The Assam branch of RCPI sided with Dasgupta in the 1948 split. In the wake of Independence, RCPI and CPI initiated mass peasant unrest in Assam. In the wake of the Dum Dum-Basirhat attacks, the party decided to launch an armed movement for the independence of Assam from India. The party held a conference in Khowang, Dibrugarh, at which is decided to build a 'People's Army' as an armed mass front of the party. RCPI-led uprisings in Assam took place between 1948 and 1952.Informal Development, Services Access and Land Rights Claims ‚Äì Dynamics of Conflicts in Hill Settlements, Guwahati, CUE Working Paper 29 January 2016 Khagen Barbarua led the movement in the non-tribal areas in Upper Assam. The party raised the battle cry 'land belongs to the one who wields a plough, the jungle belongs to one who wields an axe', calling for ownership rights for sharecroppers. The Assam government placed a ban on the party, citing the pretext that RCPI organized peasants to cease payments to landlords and supported illegal felling of trees. In early 1950 RCPI killed Ganga Sarma, a local Indian National Congress leader in Assam, during a meeting. According to the government of Assam, RCPI committed 12 assassinations in the state in 1950. RCPI financed its rebellion in Assam through robberies and extortion. The government responded by cracking down on RCPI in Assam. The government responded by cracking down on RCPI in Assam. As a symbolic protest against the state violence, RCPI cadres tore down the national flag at different places in the state. In the wake of state repression against RCPI, the party lost influence amongst the sharecroppers in Assam. In the wake of state repression against RCPI, the party lost influence amongst the sharecroppers in Assam. In Assam RCPI and CPI were at loggerheads, especially around the issue of the Soviet Union (RCPI accusing CPI of being controlled by the Soviets, CPI accusing RCPI of being anti-Soviet). RCPI-CPI relations reached its lowest point in 1952. Work amongst refugees RCPI had a mass organization, the Bastuhara Kalyan Parishad, which organized relief activities in camps of refugees from East Pakistan.Anusua Basu Roy Chaudhury/Ishita Dey. Citizens, Non-Citizens, and in the Camps Lives The party also had a separate refugee women's organization, Bangiya Dal Seba Sangathan. RCPI concentrated its work amongst refugees in Nadia district.

At Goshala the RCPI cadre Arun Banerjee organized refugee youth into revolutionary politics. The party joined the United Central Refugee Council in August 1950. RCPI(Rebel) in UCRC and ULF. In October 1950 RCPI forcefully took control of 175 bighas near Gayeshpur Colony and redistributed the land amongst 350 refugee families. First General Election The party boycotted the 1951‚Äì1952 elections. In October 1952, the Assam government withdrew the ban on the RCPI. Union activism RCPI was active within the United Trade Union Congress, but opposed RSP domination of UTUC.\\"United Trade Union Congress and Others\\" RCPI in Bihar RCPI never gained any prominence in Bihar. The influence of the party solely included a few trade unions in Chhotanagpur. One union influenced by RCPI was the Hindustan Khan Mazdoor Sangh, a coal miners' union. RCPI in Bombay Krishna Desai, a textile worker from Bombay, joined RCPI in 1947. He was elected to the Bombay Municipal Corporation at numerous times as a RCPI candidate. Desai joined CPI ahead of the 1967 state assembly election. Desai had sought refugee in Calcutta, as he was on the run after his role in communal violence. The stayed with the RCPI there and when he returned to Bombay he founded a RCPI branch there. Another labour organizer of RCPI in Bombay was K.L. Bajaj, who became a RCPI member after a visit to Calcutta in the early 1950s. He joined CPI(M) in 1964 and later became vice president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.People's Democracy.

Dasgupta had evolved into a Nehru supporter. In the Indo-China war of 1962 RCPI supported the Nehru government, a move the Trotskyists opposed. As a result of the dispute over the Indo-China war, the Trotskyists broke with RCPI in 1963. Dasgupta himself parted ways with RCPI, moving towards a Gandhian position. 1967 elections Kumar served as convenor of the United Front formed ahead of the 1967 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. Anadi Das lost his assembly seat in the election. During the protests against the dismissal of the first United Front cabinet in 1967, Kumar was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act.

STATISTICAL REPORT ON GENERAL ELECTION, 1967 TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF ASSAM In the Second United Front government After the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election Kumar was named Food and Supplies Minister in the second United Front state government. The Food Minister had been given to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the coalition government, but CPI(M) opted to name Kumar as its choice for the post. The RCPI won two seats in the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. Kumar was named convenor of the United Front as well as being named Food Minister in the Second United Front Cabinet. After Kumar's entry into the West Bengal state cabinet, the two RCPI legislators, Anadi Das and M. Mokshed Ali, revolted against Kumar's leadership. In July 1969 the two legislators were expelled from RCPI, accused of \\"anti-Party and anti-UF activities\\". The expulsion provoked a split in RCPI, with Anadi Das leading his own RCPI faction. 1970s After the fall of the United Front cabinet, the RCPI joined the CPI(M)-led United Left Front. The front, which was formally constituted in May 1970, had Kumar as its convenor. In the 1971 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election RCPI won three seats; Bimalananda Mukherjee in Santipur, Sudhindranath Kumar in Howrah Central and Trilochan Mal in Hansan.

Medical uses Metyrapone can be used in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Metyrapone 30 mg/kg, maximum dose 3,000 mg, is administered at midnight usually with a snack. The plasma cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol are measured the next morning between 8:00 and 9:00 am. A plasma cortisol less than 220 nmol/l indicates adequate inhibition of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase. In patients with intact Hypothalamo- pituitary-adrenal axis, CRH and ACTH levels rise as a response to the falling cortisol levels. This results in an increase of the steroid precursors in the pathway. Therefore, if 11-deoxycortisol levels do not rise and remain less than 7 ¬µg/dl (202 nmol/l) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) rises, then it is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. If neither 11-deoxycortisol nor ACTH rise, it is highly suggestive of an impaired hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis at either the pituitary or hypothalamus. Metyrapone test may aid in verifying the cause of Cushing's syndrome. Most patients with pituitary dysfunction and/or pituitary microadenoma will increase ACTH secretion in response to metyrapone, while most ectopic ACTH- producing tumors will not. Pituitary macroadenomas do not always respond to metyrapone. Metyrapone is used for the medical control of hypercortisolism in Cushing's syndrome (ACTH dependent or independent). The aim for medical treatment is to achieve pre-operative control of hypercortisolism, or for control of residual disease persisting post-operatively (TSS, adrenalectomy). It is not for long term definitive treatment/cure, only as an adjunct (surgery is the aim for cure in most causes of Cushing's syndrome). Metyrapone hence acts by inhibiting adrenal steroidogenesis. One side effect is hirsutism (in women) because of the excess androgen precursors created. The other commonly used agent for medical treatment of Cushing's is ketoconazole (an anti-fungal agent). This does not exhibit the side effect of hirsutism. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Metyrapone blocks cortisol biosynthesis by acting as a reversible inhibitor of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase. This stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, which in turn increases plasma 11-deoxycortisol levels. Chemistry Analogues of metyrapone include aminoglutethimide, amphenone B, and mitotane. Research Metyrapone has been found in early human trials to reduce recollection of emotional memories in normal volunteers. The volunteers showed significant impairment in ability to retrieve memories with negative emotional content while not impairing memories with neutral content. This has significant implication in the study of the process of emotional healing in post traumatic stress disorder. Due to the permissive action of cortisol on glucagon, partial blockade of cortisol may reduce the effects of circulating glucagon in chronically increasing blood glucose in metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) and type 2 diabetes.

During normal operation, the computer regularly resets the watchdog timer to prevent it from elapsing, or \\"timing out\\". If, due to a hardware fault or program error, the computer fails to reset the watchdog, the timer will elapse and generate a timeout signal. The timeout signal is used to initiate corrective actions. The corrective actions typically include placing the computer system in a safe state and restoring normal system operation. Watchdog timers are commonly found in embedded systems and other computer-controlled equipment where humans cannot easily access the equipment or would be unable to react to faults in a timely manner. In such systems, the computer cannot depend on a human to invoke a reboot if it hangs; it must be self-reliant. For example, remote embedded systems such as space probes are not physically accessible to human operators; these could become permanently disabled if they were unable to autonomously recover from faults. A watchdog timer is usually employed in cases like these. Watchdog timers may also be used when running untrusted code in a sandbox, to limit the CPU time available to the code and thus prevent some types of denial-of-service attacks.\\"The Grenade Timer: Fortifying the Watchdog Timer Against Malicious Mobile Code\\" by Frank Stajano and Ross Anderson (2000). Watchdog timers are also used in operating systems where certain high priority operations are required to complete in a specific time interval. If the timer expires before the operation completes then the OS responds to the timer interrupt by recording error data and terminating the operation. A system may have both types of watchdog timer. Architecture and operation =Watchdog restart= The act of restarting a watchdog timer, commonly referred to as \\"kicking\\" the watchdog , is typically done by writing to a watchdog control port. Alternatively, in microcontrollers that have an integrated watchdog timer, the watchdog is sometimes kicked by executing a special machine language instruction or setting a specific bit in a register. An example of this is the CLRWDT (clear watchdog timer) instruction found in the instruction set of some PIC microcontrollers. In computers that are running operating systems, watchdog resets are usually invoked through a device driver. For example, in the Linux operating system, a user space program will kick the watchdog by interacting with the watchdog device driver, typically by writing a zero character to \`/dev/watchdog\`. The device driver, which serves to abstract the watchdog hardware from user space programs, is also used to configure the time-out period and start and stop the timer. =Single-stage watchdog= Watchdog timers come in many configurations, and many allow their configurations to be altered. Microcontrollers often include an integrated, on-chip watchdog. In other computers the watchdog may reside in a nearby chip that connects directly to the CPU, or it may be located on an external expansion card in the computer's chassis. The watchdog and CPU may share a common clock signal, as shown in the block diagram below, or they may have independent clock signals. alt=Block diagram of a simple, single-stage watchdog timer. The common clock is characteristic of basic watchdog microcontrollers. =Multistage watchdog= Two or more timers are sometimes cascaded to form a multistage watchdog timer, where each timer is referred to as a timer stage, or simply a stage. For example, the block diagram below shows a three-stage watchdog. In a multistage watchdog, only the first stage is kicked by the processor. Upon first stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated and the next stage in the cascade is started. As each subsequent stage times out, it triggers a corrective action and starts the next stage. Upon final stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated, but no other stage is started because the end of the cascade has been reached. Typically, single- stage watchdog timers are used to simply restart the computer, whereas multistage watchdog timers will sequentially trigger a series of corrective actions, with the final stage triggering a computer restart. alt=A three-stage electronic watchdog timer. =Time intervals= Watchdog timers may have either fixed or programmable time intervals. Some watchdog timers allow the time interval to be programmed by selecting from among a few selectable, discrete values. In others, the interval can be programmed to arbitrary values. Typically, watchdog time intervals range from ten milliseconds to a minute or more. In a multistage watchdog, each timer may have its own, unique time interval. Corrective actions A watchdog timer may initiate any of several types of corrective action, including maskable interrupt, non-maskable interrupt, processor reset, fail-safe state activation, power cycling, or combinations of these. Depending on its architecture, the type of corrective action or actions that a watchdog can trigger may be fixed or programmable. Some computers (e.g., PC compatibles) require a pulsed signal to invoke a processor reset. In such cases, the watchdog typically triggers a processor reset by activating an internal or external pulse generator, which in turn creates the required reset pulses. In embedded systems and control systems, watchdog timers are often used to activate fail-safe circuitry. When activated, the fail-safe circuitry forces all control outputs to safe states (e.g., turns off motors, heaters, and high-voltages) to prevent injuries and equipment damage while the fault persists. In a two-stage watchdog, the first timer is often used to activate fail-safe outputs and start the second timer stage; the second stage will reset the computer if the fault cannot be corrected before the timer elapses. Watchdog timers are sometimes used to trigger the recording of system state information‚Äîwhich may be useful during fault recovery‚Äîor debug information (which may be useful for determining the cause of the fault) onto a persistent medium. In such cases, a second timer‚Äîwhich is started when the first timer elapses‚Äîis typically used to reset the computer later, after allowing sufficient time for data recording to complete. This allows time for the information to be saved, but ensures that the computer will be reset even if the recording process fails. alt=Two-stage watchdog timer For example, the above diagram shows a likely configuration for a two-stage watchdog timer. During normal operation the computer regularly kicks Stage1 to prevent a timeout. If the computer fails to kick Stage1 (e.g., due to a hardware fault or programming error), Stage1 will eventually timeout. This event will start the Stage2 timer and, simultaneously, notify the computer (by means of a non-maskable interrupt) that a reset is imminent. Until Stage2 times out, the computer may attempt to record state information, debug information, or both. The computer will be reset upon Stage2 timeout. Fault detection A computer system is typically designed so that its watchdog timer will be kicked only if the computer deems the system functional. The computer determines whether the system is functional by conducting one or more fault detection tests and it will kick the watchdog only if all tests have passed. In computers that are running an operating system and multiple processes, a single, simple test may be insufficient to guarantee normal operation, as it could fail to detect a subtle fault condition and therefore allow the watchdog to be kicked even though a fault condition exists. For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon can be configured to perform tests that cover resource availability (e.g., sufficient memory and file handles, reasonable CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity, and system-specific test scripts or programs may also be run. Upon discovery of a failed test, the Linux watchdog daemon may attempt to perform a software-initiated restart, which can be preferable to a hardware reset as the file systems will be safely unmounted and fault information will be logged. However it is essential to have the insurance of the hardware timer as a software restart can fail under a number of fault conditions. In effect, this is a dual-stage watchdog with the software restart comprising the first stage and the hardware reset the second stage.

It was created in 1974 by Chip Lord, Hudson Marquez and Doug Michels, who were a part of the art group Ant Farm. The installation consists of ten Cadillacs (1949-1963) buried nose-first in the ground. Installed in 1974, the cars were either older running, used or junk cars -- together spanning the successive generations of the car line -- and the defining evolution of their tailfins. History Chip Lord and Doug Michels were architects; Marquez was an art student at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. According to Chip Lord, \\"Ant Farm was founded as an alternative architectural practice, kind of an experiment in an attempt to subvert normal corporate ways of doing architecture.\\" According to Marquez, \\"Chip and I were living in the mountains north of San Francisco, and there was a book meant for kids left in a bar near where we lived. It was called ‚ÄòThe Look of Cars,‚Äô and there was something on the rise and fall of the tail fin. I didn't have a lot to do, so I just sorta drew it up. I‚Äôve always loved the Cadillacs.\\" The group claims to have been given a list of eccentric millionaires in 1972 in San Francisco, identifying Stanley Marsh 3 of Amarillo amongst those who might be able to fund one of their projects and submitted it to him. Marsh's response began \\"It's going to take me awhile to get used to the idea of the Cadillac Ranch. I'll answer you by April Fool's Day. It's such an irrelevant and silly proposition that I want to give it all my time and attention so I can make a casual judgment of it.\\" Relocation Cadillac Ranch was originally located in a wheat field, but in 1997, the installation was quietly moved by a local contractor to a location two miles (three kilometers) to the west, to a cow pasture along Interstate 40, in order to place it farther from the limits of the growing city. Both sites belonged to the local millionaire Stanley Marsh 3, the patron of the project. Marsh was well known in the city for his longtime patronage of artistic endeavors including the Cadillac Ranch; Floating Mesa; Amarillo Ramp, a work by land artist Robert Smithson; and a series of fake traffic signs throughout the city known collectively as the Dynamite Museum.Colker, David (2014-6-17) \\"Stanley Marsh 3 dies at 76; Texas philanthropist created Cadillac Ranch\\" Los Angeles Times As of 2013, Stanley Marsh 3 did not own the Cadillac Ranch; ownership appears to have been transferred to a family trust some time before his June 2014 death. Cadillac Ranch is visible from the highway, and though located on private land, visiting it (by driving along a frontage road and entering the pasture by walking through an unlocked gate) is tacitly encouraged. In addition, writing graffiti on or otherwise spray-painting the vehicles is now encouraged, and the vehicles, which have long since lost their original colors, are wildly decorated. Ant Farm artists have encouraged this kind of public interaction with the cars. \\"If it had been sited in a remote place,\\" Chip Lord said, \\"it would be pristine today.\\" \\"And no one would have seen it,\\" Doug Michels added. \\"We wanted it to be an interactive monument, so people could express themselves.\\" The cars are periodically repainted various colors (once white for the filming of a television commercial, another time pink in honor of Stanley's wife Wendy's birthday, and again all 10 cars were painted flat black to mark the passing of Ant Farm artist Doug Michels, or simply to provide a fresh canvas for future visitors).

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970, the Wolf Prize in 1992 and the 2008 Abel Prize. Biography He received his B.A. from Yale University in 1955 and his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1959 under the supervision of Saunders Mac Lane. After spending some time on the Mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago, he moved in 1970 to the Rouse Ball Professorship in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, England, and later moved to the Mathematics Department of the University of Florida as a Graduate Research Professor. He is currently a Professor Emeritus of Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, and professor of mathematics at the University of Florida. He received the Abel Prize 2008 together with Jacques Tits. Work Thompson's doctoral thesis introduced new techniques, and included the solution of a problem in finite group theory which had stood for around sixty years, the nilpotency of Frobenius kernels. At the time, this achievement was noted in The New York Times.http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/lam/paper/html/NYTimes.html New York Times article, April 26, 1959. Thompson became a figure in the progress toward the classification of finite simple groups. In 1963, he and Walter Feit proved that all nonabelian finite simple groups are of even order (the Odd Order Paper, filling a whole issue of the Pacific Journal of Mathematics). This work was recognised by the award of the 1965 Cole Prize in Algebra of the American Mathematical Society. His N-group papers classified all finite simple groups for which the normalizer of every non-identity solvable subgroup is solvable. This included, as a by-product, the classification of all minimal finite simple groups (simple groups for which every proper subgroup is solvable). This work had some influence on later developments in the classification of finite simple groups, and was quoted in the citation by Richard Brauer for the award of Thompson's Fields Medal in 1970 (Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Nice, France, 1970). The Thompson group Th is one of the 26 sporadic finite simple groups. Thompson also made major contributions to the inverse Galois problem. He found a criterion for a finite group to be a Galois group, that in particular implies that the monster simple group is a Galois group. Awards In 1971, Thompson was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 1982, he was awarded the Senior Berwick Prize of the London Mathematical Society, and in 1988, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Oxford. Thompson was awarded the United States National Medal of Science in 2000. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society (United Kingdom), and a recipient of its Sylvester Medal in 1985. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

Sindoor is a traditional vermilion red or orange-red colored cosmetic powder from the Indian subcontinent, usually worn by married women along the part of their hair. In Hindu communities the use of sindoor indicates a woman is married and ceasing to wear it usually implies widowhood. The main component of traditional sindooram is usually cinnabar (cinnabar is mercury sulfide, a toxic mineral), turmeric and lime.Formulation and Evaluation of Herbal Sindoor Using Different Natural/Herbal Ingredients. S. Samariya, S. Dwivedi, S. Patil, D. Panigrahi, H. Joshi ‚Äì International Journal of Pharmacy Teaching & Practices 2013, Vol.4, Issue 3, 752-754 Some commercial sindoor products contain synthetic ingredients, some of which are not manufactured to proper standards and may contain lead.The Hazards of Synthetic Sindoor Application of sindoor Woman from Howrah, India with sindoor. Women applying sindoor to each other during Durga Puja festival in Kolkata, India. Sindoor is traditionally applied at the beginning or completely along the parting-line of a woman‚Äôs hair (also called mang in Hindi or simandarekha in Sanskrit) or as a dot on the forehead. Sindoor is the mark of a married woman in Hinduism. Single women wear the bindi in different colors for special occasions but do not apply sindoor in their parting of the hairline. Widows do not wear sindoor or bindis, signifying that their husband is no longer alive. The sindoor is first applied to the woman by her husband on the day of her wedding; this is called the Sindoor Daanam ceremony. After this, she applies it herself every day. A similar coloring ritual is known as pasupu kumkuma, named after another name for sindoor, kumkuma. The wiping off of the sindoor is very significant for a widow. There are many rituals associated with this practice. The most common is when a mother-in-law or older sister-in-law wipes off the sindoor when a woman becomes a widow. The widow will break her bangles and remove her bindi as well, and many will also remove their nose ring and toe rings. The parting of hair is symbolic of a river of red blood full of life. When the sindoor is removed then the river becomes barren, dry and empty. This custom is prevalent in rural areas and is followed by all castes and social ranks. The Real Significance Of ‚ÄòEk Chutki Sindoor‚Äô for Hindu Married Women The red sindoor is significant for the married woman as she is full of colour. When she becomes a widow she adopts plain white dress and removes all colour from her face including the bright red sindoor. Methods and styles of applying the sindoor vary from personal choice to regional customs. Many new brides will fill the whole hair line with sindoor, while other married women may just apply a red spot at the end of the hair line and forehead. Recently, a triangle shape on the forehead pointing towards the nose, with a diamond bindi for fashion, is being worn by younger women.How To Put Sindoor On Forehead Fashion that defies customs The Times of India- V Lakshmi -Jan 8, 2015, Hinduism Female figurines excavated at Mehrgarh, Baluchistan seem to imply application of sindoor to the parting of women's hair in Harappa culture. According to the legends, Radha the consort of Lord Krishna turned the kumkum into a flame-like design on her forehead. In the famous epic Mahabharata, Draupadi the wife of the Pandavas wipes off her sindoor in disgust and despair at the happenings in Hastinapura. Use of sindoor is frequently mentioned in the puranas Lalitha Sahasranama and Soundarya Lahari.History and Significance of Sindoor Adi Shankaracharya writes in Soundarya Lahari:http://www.sankaracharya.org/soundarya_lahari.php Soundarya Lahari translated by P. R. Ramachander Jain women apply the sindoor, mostly in the cities. Jain nuns are forbidden to apply this to their hair line or foreheads. The display of the sindoor is considered very important to indicate the married status of the groom, whereas in several local cultures, sindooram is applied on their hair partings by unmarried women. Application of sindoor is essentially a Hindu tradition. In the 19th century, Sufi leader Sharafuddin Maneri encouraged Muslim women to apply sindoor in Bangladesh. This was severely condemned by reformist movements.  Composition and as Ayurvedic Medicine There are various forms of Sindhoor mentioned in Ayurveda. Traditional sindhoor is made from natural ingredients used for facial makeup (cosmetics). Most widely used traditional Sindhoor is made from turmeric and lime juice. Other ingredients include Ghee, and slaked lime. This is also called Kumkum. Sindhoor is also made from red sandal powder, saffron etc. The coloured powders sold as substitutes are traditionally not considered Sindhoor. Toxicity concerns Boys covered with mercury-containing red vermilion chemical in a factory producing colour in Bangladesh. Traditional sindoor was made with turmeric and alum or lime, or from other herbal ingredients. Unlike red lead and vermilion, these are not poisonous. Modern material being sold as sindhoor mainly uses vermilion, an orange-red pigment, the purified and powdered form of cinnabar, which is the chief form in which mercury sulfide naturally occurs. As with other compounds of mercury, sindoor is toxic and must be handled carefully. Sometimes, red lead (lead tetroxide, also known as minium) is added to sindoor.} Red lead is toxic. In early 2008, allegations of high lead content led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to recall batches of sindoor from several manufacturers. In popular culture Priyanka Chopra with sindoor applied as a red streak, along the parting of her hair, with her husband Nick Jonas in Jodhpur, India in 2018. There are many Indian movies and dramas involving sindoor, with their themes revolving around the ritual's significance. These include Sindoor (1947), Sindooram (1976), Rakta Sindhuram (1985), Sindoor (1987), and Sindoor Tere Naam Ka (series, 2005‚Äì2007).

His formal education consisted of two years at an elementary school (possibly the school of John Whitaker, also of Allerthorpe), but he continued learning after this and he taught himself navigation and astronomy with the intention of becoming a sailor. His mother dissuaded him from that career and he became a teacher. He made such a success of being an impromptu teacher to the farmers‚Äô sons of the Pocklington district, that only a year later he was able to open a village school at Bielby. He continued to teach others by day and learn himself by night, and soon moved his school from Bielby to Skirpenbeck. At Skirpenbeck he met his future wife, who was one of his pupils, and five years his junior. Fifty years on she spoke of how her husband developed his brief rudimentary education into becoming a schoolmaster: ‚ÄúHe first learned mathematics by buying an old volume from a bookstall with a spare shilling. He also got odd sheets, and read books about geometry and mathematics, before he could buy them; for he had very little to spare‚Äù. But Cooke's interest in mathematics and science was practical as well academic. He had also retained his interest in navigation and instruments, and while at Skirpenbeck he made his own first rudimentary telescope ‚Äì grinding a lens by hand out of the bottom of a glass whisky tumbler, then mounting in into a frame that he soldered together from a piece of tin. In 1829 he moved to York and worked as a mathematics schoolmaster at the Rev. Schackley's School in Ogleforth, near York Minster. He also taught in various ladies' schools to increase his income. His marriage to Hannah was to produce seven children, five of whom were boys. Two of these Charles Frederick (1836‚Äì98) and Thomas (1839‚Äì1919) subsequently joined him in the business he founded in 1836 at number 50 (now renumbered to 18) Stonegate, close to York Minster with the assistance of a loan of ¬£100 from his wife's uncle. Cooke studied optics and became interested in making telescopes, the first of which was a refracting telescope with the base of a tumbler shaped to form its lens. This led to his friends including John Phillips encouraging him to make telescopes and other optical devices commercially. Work In 1837 he established his first optical business in a small shop at 50 Stonegate, York, and later moved to larger premises in Coney Street. He built his first telescope for William Gray. At that time, the excise tax on glass discouraged the making of refracting telescopes, which were usually imported from abroad. Cooke was thus one of the pioneers of making such telescopes in Britain. He made more instruments and built his reputation. He was not only an optician but had mechanical abilities as well, and among other things, manufactured turret clocks for church towers. He founded the firm T. Cooke & Sons. In 1855 he moved to bigger premises, the Buckingham Works at Bishophill in York, where factory methods of production were first applied to optical instruments. He exhibited at the York Exhibition in 1866 demonstrating his three-wheeled, steam-powered car which he claimed could carry 15 people at 15 mph for a distance of 40 miles. One of his finest achievements was the construction of the 25-inch 'Newall' refractor for Robert Stirling Newall; sadly, Thomas died before seeing it completed. For some years the Newall was the largest refracting telescope in the world. On Newall's death it was donated to the Cambridge Observatory and finally moved in 1959 to Mount Penteli observatory in Penteli, Greece. He made a telescope for the Royal Observatory, also Greenwich and another for Prince Albert. The firm amalgamated with Troughton & Simms (London) to become Cooke, Troughton & Simms in 1922 and this later became part of Vickers, but still run by his sons Thomas & Frederick. Thomas Cooke was succeeded by his sons, Thomas and Frederick. He is buried in York Cemetery.

He was commander-in-chief of the French Expeditionary Force sent by France in order to help the American Continental Army fight against British forces.  Military life  Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur was born in Vend√¥me, in the province of Orl√©anais, and he was schooled at the Jesuit college in Blois. After the death of his elder brother, he entered a cavalry regiment and served in Bohemia, Bavaria, and on the Rhine during the War of the Austrian Succession. By 1747, he had attained the rank of colonel. He took part in the Siege of Maastricht (1748) and became governor of Vend√¥me in 1749. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Minorca (1756) on the outbreak of the Seven Years' War and was promoted to Brigadier General of infantry. In 1758, he fought in Germany, notably in the Battle of Krefeld and the Battle of Clostercamp, receiving several wounds at Clostercamp.

Axel von Fersen the Younger served as his aide-de-camp and interpreter. The small size of the force at his disposal made him initially reluctant to lead the expedition.

The College in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (now known as Brown University) served as an encampment site for some of Rochambeau's troops, and the College Edifice was converted into a military hospital, now known as University Hall. In July 1781, the force left Rhode Island and marched across Connecticut to join Washington on the Hudson River in Mount Kisco, New York. The Odell farm served as Rochambeau's headquarters from 6 July to 18 August 1781. Washington and Rochambeau then marched their combined forces to the siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. On 22 September, they combined with the Marquis de Lafayette's troops and forced heavily outnumbered and trapped Lord Cornwallis to surrender on 19 October. The Congress of the Confederation presented Rochambeau with two cannons taken from the British in recognition of his service. He returned them to Vend√¥me, and they were requisitioned in 1792.  Return to France  Upon his return to France, Rochambeau was honored by King Louis XVI and was made governor of the province of Picardy. He supported the French Revolution of 1789, and on 28 December 1791 he and Nicolas Luckner became the last two generals created Marshal of France by Louis XVI. When the French Revolutionary Wars broke out, he commanded the Arm√©e du Nord for a time in 1792 but resigned after several reversals to the Austrians. He was arrested during the Reign of Terror in 1793‚Äì94 and narrowly escaped the guillotine. He was subsequently pensioned by Napoleon and died at Thor√©-la-Rochette during the First Empire.  Legacy  =Honors= US Postage Stamp, 1931 issue, honoring Rochambeau, George Washington, and Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse, commemorating 150th anniversary of the victory at Yorktown, 1781 President Theodore Roosevelt unveiled a statue of Rochambeau by Ferdinand Hamar as a gift from France to the United States on 24 May 1902, standing in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.. The ceremony was made the occasion of a great demonstration of friendship between the two nations. France was represented by ambassador Jules Cambon, Admiral Fournier, and General Henri Brug√®re, as well as a detachment of sailors and marines from the battleship Gaulois. Representatives of the Lafayette and Rochambeau families also attended. A Rochambeau f√™te was held simultaneously in Paris. In 1934, A.

Cooke & Sons was an English instrument-making firm, headquartered in York. It was founded by Thomas Cooke by 1837. (Not dated, no publisher given.) History The Fry 8-inch-aperture refracting telescope, manufactured by Thomas Cooke in the 1860s, at the University of London Observatory. In 1837 Cooke leased a shop at 50 Stonegate, York, with his wife running the shop and Cooke's workshop occupying the rear where he made and repaired whatever instruments were needed. He made a screw-cutting lathe for his own use. A notable instrument made at this time was a 4.5 inch equatorial refracting telescope. Cooke himself made the whole instrument including the optical elements at a time when most instrument makers specialised in making either the optical or mechanical components.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World P. 50 The 1851 census shows that Cooke employed four men and an apprentice.In 1855 Cooke exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris and won a First Class Medal for a 7.5 inch equatorial refractor.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 50-51 By 1855 Thomas Cooke had built a factory at Bishophill in York.Vickers Instruments - Borthwick Institute for Archives, The University of York In 1864 Cooke undertook his first order for surveying equipment when he built 16 theodolites to be sent to India. On arrival they were found to be very well made except that the circle division was faulty. They were returned to York and redivided. By 1870 The Survey of India used Cooke levels for the primary survey in preference to Troughton & Simms products as they considered them to be superior.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 54-58 Following the death of Cooke in 1868, the business was continued by his sons.Focus falls on Vickers Instruments (From York Press) The firm built the clock face on the Darlington clock tower. Cooke & Sons also provisded a 12 inch theodolite for the construction of the Forth Railway Bridge. Observatory domes were also made using papier-mach√© including in 1883 one for Greenwich Observatory.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 59-61 In 1892 Dennis Taylor, working to reduce chromatic aberration, invented a three element lens design incorporating a new Schott glass element. This design was called a 'photo- visual' design and used for both visual and photographic astronomy.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 66-68 Taylor became Optical Manager at the firm in 1893. Six lightweight theodolites were made for Scott's ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition of 1910-1913. Dennis Taylor modified his three element lens design for photographic purposes, patenting his work in 1905 and 1906. This 'Cooke Triplet' lens design was an improvement on most camera lenses of the time though it was in competition with the 1902 Zeiss Tessar design. In 1904 Taylor discovered that a tarnished surface layer could reduce reflections from glass surfaces. Although this effect jad been discovered by Lord Rayleigh in 1886 the use of lens coatings was not widely known. With war looming the firm began to work with Arthur Pollen on his 'Aim Correction' system for improving the accuracy of naval gunnery. Cooke & Sons supplied the optical components for the system which consisted of a gyroscopically stabilised rangefinder where successive readings of a moving target were mechanically integrated to give a prediction of range and bearing. In the event the British Admiralty for the most part chose the simpler and cheaper Dreyer predcictor.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 69-75 In 1914, a new factory was built in Bishophill. In 1915 Vickers acquired a controlling stake in the company. During World War I about half of the factory's capacity was turned over to contracts for large naval rangefinders from the main contractor, Barr & Stroud In 1922 Vickers merged it with Troughton & Simms to form Cooke, Troughton & Simms. (About the merger with Troughton & Simms.) In 1924 the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Vickers. In 1939 another factory was built on a larger site in Haxby Road and during the Second World War, the company employed 3,300 people. In 1963 the company was renamed Vickers Instruments. In 1989 the company was sold to Bio- Rad Micromeasurements, apart from the defence products, which were sold to British Aerospace. The Haxby Road site was demolished in 2008.

It was formed when Edward Troughton in his old age took on William Simms as a partner in 1826. It became a limited company in 1915Scientific Instrument Society 25th Anniversary Exhibition and in 1922 it merged with T. Cooke & Sons to form Cooke, Troughton & Simms. The firm had its origins in the instrument-making business begun in 1764 by John Troughton (1716-1788). This business was successively passed down first to nephews, John Troughton (1739-1807) and then to Edward Troughton (1756-1835). In 1826 Edward Troughton took on William Simms as partner. Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 6-7 Origins In 1756, John Troughton Senior from Corney, Cumberland, set up business in London, having completed his apprenticeship with London instrument maker Thomas Heath. In 1769, his nephew John Troughton Junior, after completing his apprenticeship with his uncle, set up in business for himself. He took over the business of Benjamin Cole in 1782, a maker of orreries at a shop in Fleet Street called \\"At the Sign of The Orrery\\". His work at that time was mostly providing a service to other craftsmen in the difficult skill of dividing circles by hand for navigation, surveying and astronomical instruments. In 1789, he took his brother Edward Troughton into partnership. The Board of Longitude was wound up in 1828, but the Board of Ordnance (now Ordnance Survey) started work on the Triangulation of Britain in 1791. This was reflected in the change in Troughton's work away from astronomical and navigational towards terrestrial surveying. William Simms completed his goldsmithing apprenticeship in 1815 and set up business as a maker of marine compasses. In about 1825, he was asked to repair and re-divide an astronomical circle made by Troughton. Having completed this work, he wrote a paper for Edward Troughton describing his new method of dividing which was more accurate than an engine and quicker than using a roller.SDUK, The Penny Cyclopedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge Vol 11 P 330 Edward Troughton took on William Simms as a partner in 1826.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 6-24 Notable Troughton instruments from this period include the Equatorial telescope at Armagh Observatory (1795), the Mural circle at Greenwich Royal Observatory (1812), and the Transit telescope at Greenwich Royal Observatory (1816). Troughton & Simms during the Industrial Revolution In 1828, George Everest returned from India and asked Simms to repair instruments used for the Survey of India. To try to make his theodolites less susceptible to field conditions Everest proposed a new pattern with a lower centre of gravity. In 1834, the Houses of Parliament burned down so a new set of national standards of length were commissioned. In 1835 George Airy became Astronomer Royal and commissioned new instruments. Large castings were contracted to Maudslay and Ransomes. Optical parts were often supplied by Dollond. From about 1830 to 1850 Britain was gripped by Railway Mania resulting in high demand for levels and theodolites. Troughton & Simms exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851.J. A. Bennett, The Divided Circle Pp. 124-124 William Simms died in 1860 and the firm took William Simms Junior and his cousin James into partnership. Optical glass technology allowed larger lenses to be made and these were sourced from French and German makers such as Guinand and Merz. In 1866, a transit and spectroscope were ordered by Harvard College Observatory and delivered in 1870. Slow delivery appears to have happened a lot and seems to have been partly due to insistence on precision but also the volume of business being undertaken.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 43 In 1860, Troughton & Simms opened a new works at Charlton. There were many requests from around the world for standard measure bars, and in 1876, they supplied the Imperial Standards Of Length gauges mounted at Trafalgar Square and the Greenwich Royal Observatory. The firm produced hundreds of astronomical instruments such as mural circles, transit circles, sextants, and other astronomical instruments for observatories around the world. Towards the end of this period other countries such as France, Germany and the United States were able to make instruments themselves so Troughton & Simms made more of their product for the British market.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 25-44 Notable instruments from this period include the Troughton & Simms Altazimuth Refractor (1847) at Greenwich Royal Observatory and the Troughton & Simms Astronomical Telescope (1880) for Tokyo Astronomical Observatory. Troughton & Simms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries By 1887, Troughton & Simms employed 200 people at their Charlton works. Military production began to be important with production of coincidence rangefinders for the British government. Among their clients were the Italian Navy, the Russian government and the Austro-Hungarian Hydrographic Department Observatory. Undated advertisements from this period include the claim that \\"in fifteen years our output of levels and theodolites alone was 23,000\\". An indication of their worldwide sales is how often instruments appear all around the world.MAAS AustraliaNational Museum of American History Troughton & Simms did not normally place serial numbers on their products, so dating them is inexact. The \\"Troughton & Simms\\" name was originally engraved in a copperplate font, which later changed to a much simpler font. In 1915 James Simms died and the business passed to his sons. They made the company into a limited liability company. After 1915, the company name found on their products is \\"Troughton & Simms Ltd\\". After the First World War, business and long-term prospects were poor, and in 1922 Troughton & Simms was bought by T. Cooke & Sons of York to become Cooke, Troughton & Simms.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 45-49 Notable instruments from this period include a typical late 6-inch theodolite for use by engineers and surveyors and a typical late surveyors level, which can be dated to before 1915 by the lack of \\"Ltd\\" after \\"Troughton & Simms\\".

In scripture =In the Gathic texts= Atar is already evident in the Gathas, the oldest texts of the compendium of the Avesta and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. At this juncture, as in the Yasna Haptanghaiti (the seven-chapter Yasna that structurally interrupts the Gathas and is linguistically as old as the Gathas themselves), atar is still‚Äîwith only one exception‚Äîan abstract concept simply an instrument, a medium, of the Creator and is not yet the divinity (yazata) of heat and light that atar was to become in the later texts. In the most ancient texts, atar is a medium, a faculty, through which judgement is passed and reflects the pre-Zoroastrian institution of ordeal by heat (Avestan: garmo-varah, heat ordeal; cf. Boyce 1996:ch. 6). Justice is administered through atar (Yasna 31.3, 34.4, 36.2, 47.2), the blazing atar (31.19, 51.9), through the heat of atar (43.4), through the blazing, shining, molten metal (ayangha Khshushta, 30.7, 32.7, 51.9). An individual who has passed the fiery test, has attained physical and spiritual strength, wisdom, truth and love with serenity (30.7). However, among all the references to atar in the oldest texts, it is only once addressed independently of Ahura Mazda. In this exception, atar is spoken of in the third person masculine singular: \\"He detects sinners by hand-grasping\\" (Yasna 34.4). Altogether, \\"there are said to have been some 30 kinds of fiery tests in all.\\" (Boyce, 2002:1) Also in the early texts, tangential to its role in establishing guilt, atar is the light of revelation through which Zoroaster is selected by Ahura Mazda, the Zarathushtra Mainyu Athra (Yasna 31.3), radiated by Ahura Mazda (43.9), bearing the conviction of \\"Good Purpose\\" (Vohu Manah, 43.4; see also Amesha Spenta), and enlightening one‚Äôs inner-self (46.7). Within this framework of the concept of divine illumination, atar radiates the \\"other lights\\" (31.7), the essence (of Ahura Mazda) from which insight and wisdom permeate the universe. So also Zoroaster's injunction to always pray in the presence of atar‚Äîeither towards the sun, or towards their own hearths‚Äîso as to better concentrate their devotions on asha, righteousness, and the virtue that should be striven for (Yasna 43.9, see also Boyce, 1975:455). =In later texts= The Gathic role of atar as the medium for detecting guilt is not directly evident in the later texts of the Avesta, but reappears in modified form as an allegory of burning and annihilating the Angra Mainyu through righteousness, \\"where Asha Vahishta is identified at times with the household fire on the hearth.\\" There, \\"identification in the realms of matter and of spirit serves only to bring more into prominence the main tenets of Zoroaster's teachings in regard to Asha\\" (Dhalla, 1938:170). A vestige of the ancient institution of ordeal by heat is nonetheless present in Vendidad 4.54‚Äì55, where speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is punishable by flogging and is detected by the consumption of \\"water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt.\\" The Zend translation/commentary on this passage translates \\"blazing\\" as having brimstone and sulphur, and notes that innocence or guilt was established by the consumption of this \\"guilt-detecting liquid\\". Similarly, in the Denkard, Adharbad Maraspand‚Äîthe Sassanid era high-priest to whom the collation of the Avesta texts is attributed‚Äîis purported to have nine measures of \\"unburning molten zinc\\" applied to his chest as proof of accuracy of the sacred texts. Seen chronologically, the transition from atar as a vehicle of judgement to Atar Yazata the divinity presiding over blazing fire is abrupt. While the older Gathic Avestan texts have heat (and thus fire) associated with harsh judgement, the Younger Avestan texts have the divinity Atar completely representing and being represented by fire itself; and associated with warmth and light and essential for growth. Asha Vahishta's association with atar is however carried forward, and they are often mentioned together (Yasna 62.3, Nyashes 5.9, etc.). So also in their roles as protectors, for \\"when the Evil Spirit assailed the creation of Good Truth, Good Thought and Fire intervened\\" (Yasht 13.77) It is in the later texts that Atar is personified as \\"the son\\" of Ahura Mazda (standard appellation, Yasna 25.7 et al.) and is addressed as \\"full of glory and full of healing remedies\\" (Nyash 5.6). In Yasna 17.11, Atar is \\"master of the house\\", recalling the role of the hearth fire in the Gathas. The same passage enumerates the \\"five kinds of fire\\": # atar berezi-savah, \\"the highly beneficent atar\\" (compare \\"oxygen\\"), qualified in Zend texts as \\"the fire that eats food but drinks no water\\", and the kind of fire that burns in an Atash-Behram, the highest grade of fire temple. # atar vohu-fryana, \\"the atar of good affection\\" (compare \\"fire\\", cognate with bhaga and friend), later qualified as \\"the fire diffusing goodness\\", and \\"the fire that consumes both water and food\\". # atar urvazishta, \\"the atar of greatest bliss\\" (compare \\"warmth), later qualified as \\"the fire of happy life\\", and \\"the fire that drinks water but eats no food\\". # atar vazishta, \\"the atar most swift\\" (compare \\"electric sparks\\"), later qualified as the fire in clouds, i.e. lightning, and as \\"the fire that neither drinks water nor eats food\\". # atar spenishta, \\"the atar most holy\\",. (compare \\"Aether\\", cognate Balto-Slavic ≈°ventas \\"holy\\") ( described in \\"Zend\\" texts as \\"the fire of prosperity\\" and as the spiritual fire burning before Ohrmuzd. The description of the fires in the Sassanid era commentaries (the Zend texts) differs slightly from those described in the Bundahishn (\\"Original Creation\\", completed in the 11th or 12th century). In the latter, the description of the first and last kind of fire is reversed. In culture and tradition Parsi-Zoroastrian Jashan ceremony (here the blessing of a home in Pune, India) =As a divinity= During the late Achaemenid era, adar‚Äîas the quintessence of the Yazata Adar‚Äîwas incorporated in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of divinities. In that position, Adar aids Asha Vahishta (Avestan, middle Persian: Ardvahisht), the Amesha Spenta responsible for the luminaries. From among the flowers associated with the Yazatas, Adar's is the marigold (calendula) (Bundahishn 27.24). The importance of the divinity Adar is evident from a dedication to the entity in the Zoroastrian calendar: Adar is one of the only five Yazatas that have a month-name dedication. Additionally, Adar is the name of the ninth day of the month in the Zoroastrian religious calendar, and the ninth month of the year of the civil Iranian calendar of 1925 (modern Persian: Azar) which has month-names derived from those used by the Zoroastrian calendar. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, Adar was the seventh of the seven creations of the material universe. It is only with Adar's assistance, who serves as the life- force, that the other six creations begin their work (Bundahishn 3.7‚Äì8; more logically explained in Zatspram 3.77‚Äì83). =The cult of fire= Although Zoroastrians revere fire in any form, the temple fire is not literally for the reverence of fire, but together with clean water (see Aban), is an agent of ritual purity. Clean, white \\"ash for the purification ceremonies [is] regarded as the basis of ritual life\\", which \\"are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple cult is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity\\" (Boyce, 1975:455). For, \\"the man who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand, with the Baresman in his hand, with milk in his hand, with the mortar for crushing the branches of the sacred Haoma in his hand, is given happiness\\" (Yasna 62.1; Nyashes 5.7) The Zoroastrian cult of fire is apparently much younger than Zoroastrianism itself and appears at approximately the same time as the shrine cult, first evident in the 4th century BCE (roughly contemporaneous with the introduction of Adar as a divinity). There is no allusion to a temple cult of fire in the Avesta proper, nor is there any old Persian language word for one. Moreover, Boyce suggests that the temple cult of fire was instituted in opposition to the image/shrine cult and \\"no actual ruins of a fire temple have been identified from before the Parthian period\\" (Boyce, 1975:454). That the cult of fire was a doctrinal modification and absent from early Zoroastrianism is still evident in the later Atash Nyash: in the oldest passages of that liturgy, it is the hearth fire that speaks to \\"all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal\\", which Boyce observes is not consistent with sanctified fire. The temple cult is an even later development: From Herodotus it is known that in the mid-5th century BCE the Zoroastrians worshipped to the open sky, ascending mounds to light their fires (The Histories, i.131). Strabo confirms this, noting that in the 6th century, the sanctuary at Zela in Cappadocia was an artificial mound, walled in, but open to the sky (Geographica XI.8.4.512). By the Parthian era (250 BCE‚Äì226 CE), Zoroastrianism had in fact two kinds of places of worship: One, apparently called bagin or ayazan, sanctuaries dedicated to a specific divinity, constructed in honor of the patron Yazata of an individual or family and included an icon or effigy of the honored. The second were the atroshan, the \\"places of burning fire\\", which as Boyce (1997:ch. 3) notes, became more and more prevalent as the iconoclastic movement gained support. Following the rise of the Sassanid dynasty, the shrines to the Yazatas continued to exist, with the statues‚Äîby law‚Äîeither being abandoned as empty sanctuaries, or being replaced by fire altars (so also the popular shrines to Meher/Mithra which retained the name Darb-e Mehr‚ÄîMithra's Gate‚Äîthat is today one of the Zoroastrian technical terms for a fire temple). Also, as Schippman observed (loc. Cit. Boyce, 1975:462), even during the Sassanid era (226‚Äì650 CE) there is no evidence that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity. \\"It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the Atash-i Vahram [literally: \\"victorious fire\\", later misunderstood to be the Fire of Bahram, see Gnoli, 2002:512] and the lesser Atash-i Adaran, or 'Fire of Fires', a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter\\" (Boyce, 1975:462; Boyce 1966:63). Apparently, it was only in the Atash-i Vahram that fire was kept continuously burning, with the Adaran fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that \\"the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (kadag, man, and xanag are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple-cult [...] to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration\\" (Boyce, 2002:9). The Indian Parsi-Zoroastrian practice of rendering the term athornan (derived from the Avestan language \\"athravan\\") as \\"fire-priest\\" in the English language is based on the mistaken assumption that the athra* prefix derives from atar (Boyce, 2002:16‚Äì17). The term athravan does not appear in the Gathas, where a priest is a zaotar, and in its oldest attested use (Yasna 42.6) the term appears to be synonymous with \\"missionary\\". In the later Yasht 13.94, Zoroaster himself is said to have been an athravan, which in this context could not be a reference to atar if a cult of fire and its associated priesthood did not yet exist in Zoroaster's time. Thus, in all probability, \\"the word athravan has a different derivation\\" (Boyce, 2002:17) Compare this however with the Sanskrit ‡§Ö‡§•‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç (atharvan), and the content of Atharva-v√©da. =In mythology and folklore= In Vendidad 1, Adar battles A≈æi DahƒÅka, the great dragon of the sky. In Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Hoshang, the grandson of the first man Gayomard, discovers fire in a rock. He recognizes it as the divine glory of Ahura Mazda, offers homage to it, and instructs his people to so as well. Also in the Shahnameh is the legend of Sevavash, who passes through \\"the unburning fire\\" as proof of his innocence. =As a royal symbol= Silver coin of Ardashir I with a fire altar on its verso. During the Sassanid era (226‚Äì650 CE), the symbol of Fire plays much the same role that the winged sun Faravahar did during the Achaemenid period (648‚Äì330 BCE). Beginning with Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid Empire, many of the kings of the dynasty issued one or more coins with a symbol of Fire on the verso, and seals and bullae with the fire symbol were common. The first silver coins of the empire have helmeted busts of Ardashir I (r. 226‚Äì241) or his father Papak on the obverse (a figure of the ruling monarch on the obverse is consistent throughout the dynasty), with a representation of a fire altar, accompanied by the legend atash i artakhshir, \\"Fire of Ardeshir\\", on the reverse. Ardashir's son, Shapur I (r. 241‚Äì272), has much the same image but adds two attendants at the fire altar. On the coins of Hormizd I (also known as Ardashir II, r. 272‚Äì273), the emperor himself tends the fire with the help of an attendant. Bahram II (276‚Äì293) also appears himself, accompanied by what may be his queen and son. Narseh (r. 293‚Äì303) also attends the fire himself, this time alone. On the coins of Shapur III (r. 283‚Äì388), a divinity appears to be emerging from the fire. The shape of the fire altar in the coins of Yazdegerd II (r. 438‚Äì457) are similar to those in present-day fire temples. The legend introduced under Ardeshir yields to a mint mark and year of issue under Peroz (r. 457‚Äì484), a feature evident in all the coins of the remaining dynasty.

A two-hour television movie, Escape from the Newsroom, was broadcast in 2002. The show is set in the newsroom of a television station which is never officially named, but is generally understood to be based on CBC's own Toronto affiliate CBLT. Inspired by American series The Larry Sanders Show\\"Why Canadians Aren‚Äôt Laughing at Latest Version of ‚ÄòThe Newsroom‚Äô\\" - The Daily Beast, July 9, 2012. and similar to such earlier series as the British Drop the Dead Donkey and the Australian Frontline, the series mined a dark vein of comedy from the political machinations and the sheer incompetence of the people involved in producing the fictional City Hour, the station's nightly newscast. History = Season 1 = The Newsroom was not originally intended to be an ongoing series. Its first season of thirteen episodes, broadcast in 1996‚Äì97, led to critical acclaim but no immediate follow-up commissioning. Following the end of The Newsroom, creator Ken Finkleman produced three different short-run series for the CBC, More Tears, Foolish Heart and Foreign Objects, all of which included George Findlay, the central character of The Newsroom, as a linking character.\\"The Six Faces of George\\". The Globe and Mail, March 4, 2011. A Findlay-like character with a different surname had also appeared in Finkleman's pre-Newsroom series Married Life. Findlay was also revived in the later HBO Canada series Good Dog and Good God. = Season 2 = As none of the subsequent series after the initial season of The Newsroom were as well received by the public or by critics as the original show, the CBC began to seek a new set of Newsroom episodes. Escape from the Newsroom, which included a fourth wall-breaking plot digression in which the characters directly addressed the idea of reviving the series, was meant partly as a sarcastic response to that request. However, Finkleman ultimately agreed to produce 13 new episodes, which were broadcast after a six-year hiatus since the initial series, in the winter of 2004. The last four episodes of the second season were shot as a mockumentary. = Season 3 = A third season of The Newsroom, consisting of six episodes, was broadcast on CBC beginning on February 14, 2005. In the United States, The Newsroom aired on PBS stations. All three seasons and Escape from the Newsroom are available on DVD. The series drew some renewed media attention in 2011, when Aaron Sorkin announced that his new 2012 series, set in the newsroom of a cable news channel and originally to be titled More As This Story Develops, would be renamed The Newsroom. Writing in Maclean's, Jaime Weinman said the choice of name was \\"a bit of a grimly amusing reminder that the U.S. TV industry doesn't take Canada very seriously ... 'The Newsroom' is often considered the greatest show Canada has ever produced, but a U.S. network feels no need to fear unflattering comparisons: assuming they‚Äôve heard of the show, they probably think most people in the States have not heard of it.\\" In an interview with The Daily Beast following the Sorkin show's premiere, Finkleman revealed that HBO did contact him for permission to reuse the title, which he granted as he had no further plans to revive his series. Characters =Main characters= Although the series had a large and variable ensemble cast, only three major characters were present throughout the show's entire run. George Findlay (series creator Ken Finkleman), the executive producer of City Hour, is a venal, petty man who cares only about his sex life, his lunch orders and his personal image within the network's bureaucracy. Although exceptionally intelligent, he is highly self-absorbed and utterly unconcerned about anything besides himself. In the third-season episode \\"One Dumb Idea\\", Karen offers her idea on a character based on Findlay for a sitcom idea he was trying to come up with, saying, \\"I think if you're gonna go for reality, or, sorry, for verisimilitude, I think your character should be deceitful and self-serving. Basically, pathologically ambitious and actually lacking in any real humanity.\\" In other words, a sociopath. Findlay apparently suffers from constipation, hinted at by his obsession with bran muffins, fibre products and doctor appointments for procedures including a colonoscopy. He constantly avoids talking to his mother (Clare Coulter) who keeps calling him at work. Telling people to tell her he is in a meeting or on vacation, he even went so far as to have an intern get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refused to talk to her he replies, \\"Talk to her? You're missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, she could talk to my mother. But because this place is so goddamn cheap, my mother has no one to talk to.\\" Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his BMW dealer, often calling him about small problems with his \\"$40,000 German car.\\" Findlay has also appeared in nearly all of Finkleman's other television series as a linking character, always working as a film or television producer. Jim Walcott (Peter Keleghan) is City Hour similarly shallow but far less intelligent anchorman. Walcott is often told by the others that he is smart, but Findlay always refers to him as an idiot when he is not around. He lives alone with his cat and has been charged with sexual harassment several times, including an incident when he offered sexual favours to an underage girl in return for a ride in a helicopter. In the final episode of the first season, \\"The Campaign\\", Walcott, along with other staff of the newsroom, go into politics. Walcott is running as a Liberal for the provincial government of Ontario. He is asked by a reporter from The Star whether he is in favour of eliminating child poverty in Canada, to which he responds confusedly, \\"this is a provincial election.\\" During a fundraising party he mishears a woman he is talking to about abortion, thinking she said, \\"the decision should be between the woman, her doctor and her dog.\\" After \\"listening to [their] polls\\", the campaign team decides it best for Walcott to be anti-abortion, and at an anti- abortion rally he falls victim to a slip of the tongue, saying, \\"I believe life begins at masturbation\\". Walcott's attempts to garner additional support include making appearances with his ex-wife and a disabled person, both of whom are represented by agents demanding more money per appearance. During a campaign speech, Walcott is shot and ends up in a coma with a bullet lodged in his brain. While watching the results of the election on the news, the campaign team celebrates its win just as Walcott dies in the hospital bed beside them. In Escape from the Newsroom, Walcott returns to his job as news anchor. His \\"death\\" was clarified as a two-year coma. Walcott offers Atom Egoyan a story idea about \\"a news anchor, who's shot in the head, is in a coma for two years, but survives with a bullet lodged in his brain, and then struggles to return to his news desk.\\" After Egoyan says to Walcott that he read about the same thing happening to Walcott, Walcott seems surprised and says, \\"yeah, there is a parallel there somewhere.\\" Karen Mitchell (Karen Hines) is a segment producer, and the news department's only real example of intelligence and professionalism. Karen seems to be the only one who takes journalistic integrity seriously, while the others try to find ways to boost ratings by glamourizing news stories with sensationalism. Karen is apt to point out the ignorant prejudices of most of the staff, as they, in turn, tease her for not being able to find a date. Findlay suspects her of being a lesbian after she is featured in a feminist magazine as one of ten women in the news who make a difference. He \\"connects the dots\\" of her different personality traits to arrive at this conclusion, including observations of her not being able to sustain a male-female relationship, the fact that she knows the editor of a women's magazine, and that she is aggressive, argumentative, sure of herself and moralistic. Karen, however, is not a lesbian, as this only illustrates Findlay's way of thinking. When offering her suggestion on characters profiles for Findlay's sitcom idea, after ridiculing Findlay she went on to describe a character based on herself that should be \\"highly intelligent and attractive in an unconventional way, with very strong legs from the years and years of yoga and running that she has had to do to keep her sanity in a toxic psychic environment that is 'the newsroom', and basically far too busy doing her job to get involved in your stupidity or, I'm sorry, your character's stupidity.\\" =Supporting characters= Each season had a different supporting cast of newswriters, reporters, producers and network bureaucrats. The 1996 season one cast included Jeremy Hotz and Mark Farrell as Findlay's two \\"yes men\\" segment producers, Tanya Allen as Audrey the intern, David Huband as Bruce the weatherguy, Julie Khaner as Findlay's boss Sidney, Nancy Beatty as Nancy, Findlay's other boss and David Gale as the entertainment reporter. Leah Pinsent appeared in Escape from the Newsroom as anchor Diane Gordon, a character she had previously played in Finkleman's More Tears. The 2004 season two cast included Matt Watts as Matt and Jody Racicot as Alex who replaced Jeremy and Mark as Findlay's \\"yes men\\" segment producers. Douglas Bell played Allen, a writer, hypochondriac and Harvard graduate who often stutters. Holly Lewis played Claire and Alberta Watson played Susan. Tom McCamus also appeared in one of the 2004 episodes as a newswriter who informed Findlay of his own terminal illness, to Findlay's lack of concern; his character died at the end of the episode. In 2005, the season three additions to the cast included Shaughnessy Bishop-Stall as Jason, who replaced Alex as segment producer, Kristin Booth as Nora and Sarah Strange as Susan Murdoch, Findlay's boss. Jeremy Hotz returned to the cast for the first episode when Findlay rehired his character and then fired him later that episode. =Guest stars= The show also included guest appearances by a number of public figures, including David Cronenberg, Rick Salutin, Bob Rae, Hugh Segal, Naomi Klein, Daniel Richler, Angelo Mosca, Linda McQuaig, Cynthia Dale and Noam Chomsky, playing themselves in interviews on the newscast. Escape from the Newsroom featured Atom Egoyan. =Production notes= The series was produced by Finkleman's long-time collaborator, Peter Meyboom. For several years they ran an independent production company together called 100 Per Cent Films. Other key creative contributors to The Newsroom were cinematographer Joan Hutton whose documentary style added an authentic feel and music composer Sid Robinovitch, an old friend of Finkleman's who wrote the mournful, jazzy closing theme. Another key collaborator was editor Allan Novak, who edited all of Finkleman's early Canadian work including Married Life, More Tears, Foolish Heart, and Foreign Objects. Novak also produced and directed a half hour behind the scenes documentary called Inside the Newsroom. CBC executives green-lighting and overseeing the project included Deborah Bernstein, Susan Morgan, Slawko Klymkiw and Phyllis Platt.

Taft. He returned to government to serve in appointed positions under both Republican and Democratic administrations, for Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was President of the Council on Foreign Relations for the latter. Background Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1858, Wickersham attended local schools and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He studied law by \\"reading\\", preparing for the bar through an apprenticeship with an established firm. After passing the bar, he set up a practice. He married Mildred Wendell. They had a son, Cornelius Wendell Wickersham, who later became a lawyer and a US Army Brigadier General. Career After several years of practice, in 1883 Wickersham entered the longtime law firm of Strong and Cadwalader in New York City. He became a partner four years later, and the firm was eventually named Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. He as appointed to the office of Attorney General of the United States from 1909 to 1913, in the administration of President William Howard Taft. In 1912 Wickersham supported the membership of US Assistant Attorney General William H. Lewis in the American Bar Association, after Southerners protested the African American's presence and the executive committee voted to oust him. Wickersham sent a letter to all 4700 members urging their support for Lewis, who refused to resign. After the election of President Woodrow Wilson in 1912, the Democrat appointed his own people to federal positions. During Wilson's first term, from 1914 to 1916, Wickersham was out of government and served as president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Soon after the United States entered World War I in 1917, Wickersham was named by President Wilson to serve on the War Trade Board to Cuba. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover appointed Wickersham to the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, better known as the \\"Wickersham Commission.\\" (It was described as the \\"Wickersham Committee\\" by William L. Marbury, Jr. in a 1935 letter seeking the support of U.S. Senator George L. P. Radcliffe for appointment of Alger Hiss to the U.S. Solicitor General's office; Hiss had served on the committee 1929-1930. ) Wickersham returned to government under Democratic President Franklin D.

Although primarily a physical burden, hyperhidrosis can deteriorate quality of life from a psychological, emotional, and social perspective. Common places to sweat can include underarms, face, neck, back, and groin. It has been called by some 'the silent handicap'. Both the words diaphoresis and hidrosis can mean either perspiration (in which sense they are synonymous with sweating) or excessive perspiration, in which case they refer to a specific, narrowly defined, clinical disorder. Classification Visual scale for the quantification of hyperidrosis Hyperhidrosis can either be generalized, or localized to specific parts of the body. Hands, feet, armpits, groin, and the facial area are among the most active regions of perspiration due to the high number of sweat glands (eccrine glands in particular) in these areas. When excessive sweating is localized (e.g. palms, soles, face, underarms, scalp) it is referred to as primary hyperhidrosis or focal hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating involving the whole body is termed generalized hyperhidrosis or secondary hyperhidrosis. It is usually the result of some other, underlying condition. Primary or focal hyperhidrosis may be further divided by the area affected, for instance, palmoplantar hyperhidrosis (symptomatic sweating of only the hands or feet) or gustatory hyperhidrosis (sweating of the face or chest a few moments after eating certain foods). Hyperhidrosis can also be classified by onset, either congenital (present at birth) or acquired (beginning later in life). Primary or focal hyperhidrosis usually starts during adolescence or even earlier and seems to be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. It must be distinguished from secondary hyperhidrosis, which can start at any point in life. Secondary hyperhidrosis may be due to a disorder of the thyroid or pituitary glands, diabetes mellitus, tumors, gout, menopause, certain drugs, or mercury poisoning. One classification scheme uses the amount of skin affected. In this scheme, excessive sweating in an area of 100 square centimeters (16 square inches) or more is differentiated from sweating that affects only a small area. Another classification scheme is based on possible causes of hyperhidrosis. Causes The cause of primary hyperhidrosis is unknown. Anxiety or excitement can exacerbate the condition for many sufferers. A common complaint of patients is they get nervous because they sweat, then sweat more because they are nervous. Other factors can play a role, including certain foods and drinks, nicotine, caffeine, and smells. Similarly, secondary (generalized) hyperhidrosis has many causes including certain types of cancer, disturbances of the endocrine system, infections, and medications. =Primary= Primary (focal) hyperhidrosis has many causes. * Idiopathic unilateral circumscribed hyperhidrosis * Reported association with: ** Blue rubber bleb nevus ** Glomus tumor ** POEMS syndrome ** Burning feet syndrome (Gopalan's) ** Trench foot ** Causalgia ** Pachydermoperiostosis ** Pretibial myxedema * Gustatory sweating associated with: ** Encephalitis ** Syringomyelia ** Diabetic neuropathies ** Herpes zoster (shingles) ** Parotitis ** Parotid abscesses ** Thoracic sympathectomy ** Auriculotemporal or Frey's syndrome * Miscellaneous ** Lacrimal sweating (due to postganglionic sympathetic deficit, often seen in Raeder's syndrome) ** Harlequin syndrome ** Emotional hyperhidrosis =Cancer= A variety of cancers have been associated with the development of secondary hyperhidrosis including lymphoma, pheochromocytoma, carcinoid tumors (resulting in carcinoid syndrome), and tumors within the thoracic cavity. =Endocrine= Certain endocrine conditions are also known to cause secondary hyperhidrosis including diabetes mellitus (especially when blood sugars are low), acromegaly, hyperpituitarism, and various forms of thyroid disease. =Medications= Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., sertraline) is a common cause of medication-induced secondary hyperhidrosis. Other medications associated with secondary hyperhidrosis include tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glyburide, insulin, anxiolytic agents, adrenergic agonists, and cholinergic agonists. =Miscellaneous= * In people with a past history of spinal cord injuries ** Autonomic dysreflexia ** Orthostatic hypotension ** Posttraumatic syringomyelia * Associated with peripheral neuropathies ** Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome) ** Congenital autonomic dysfunction with universal pain loss ** Exposure to cold, notably associated with cold-induced sweating syndrome * Associated with probable brain lesions ** Episodic with hypothermia (Hines and Bannick syndrome) ** Episodic without hypothermia ** Olfactory * Associated with systemic medical problems ** Parkinson's disease ** Fibromyalgia ** Congestive heart failure ** Anxiety ** Obesity ** Menopausal state ** Night sweats ** Compensatory ** Infantile acrodynia induced by chronic low-dose mercury exposure, leading to elevated catecholamine accumulation and resulting in a clinical picture resembling pheochromocytoma. *Febrile diseases *Vigorous exercise *A hot, humid environment Diagnosis Symmetry of excessive sweating in hyperhidrosis is most consistent with primary hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating affecting only one side of the body is more suggestive of secondary hyperhidrosis and further investigation for a neurologic cause is recommended. Treatment There are several systemic, topical, surgical and electrical treatments available for hyperhidrosis. Topical agents for hyperhidrosis therapy include formaldehyde lotion, topical anticholinergics etc. These agents reduce perspiration by denaturing keratin, in turn occluding the pores of the sweat glands. They have a short-lasting effect. Formaldehyde is classified as a probable human carcinogen as its continuous inhalation day after day, year after year, has been linked with nasal and brain cancers, and possibly leukemia. Contact sensitization is increased, especially with formalin. =Medications= Aluminium chlorohydrate is used in regular antiperspirants. However, hyperhidrosis requires solutions or gels with a much higher concentration. These antiperspirant solutions or hyperhidrosis gels are especially effective for treatment of axillary or underarm regions. Normally it takes around three to five days to see improvement. The most common side- effect is skin irritation. For severe cases of plantar and palmar hyperhidrosis, there has been some success with conservative measures such as higher strength aluminium chloride antiperspirants. Treatment algorithms for hyperhidrosis recommend topical antiperspirants as the first line of therapy for hyperhidrosis. Both the International Hyperhidrosis Society and the Canadian Hyperhidrosis Advisory Committee have published treatment guidelines for focal hyperhidrosis that are said to be evidence-based. Prescription medications called anticholinergics, often taken by mouth, are sometimes used in the treatment of both generalized and focal hyperhidrosis. Anticholinergics used for hyperhidrosis include propantheline, glycopyrronium bromide or glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, methantheline, and benzatropine. Use of these drugs can be limited, however, by side-effects, including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and visual disturbances such as mydriasis (dilation of the pupils) and cycloplegia. For people who find their hyperhidrosis is made worse by anxiety-provoking situations (public speaking, stage performances, special events such as weddings, etc.), taking an anticholinergic medicine before the event may be helpful. Several anticholinergic drugs can reduce hyperhidrosis. Oxybutynin (brand name Ditropan) is one that has shown promise, although it can have side-effects, such as drowsiness, visual symptoms and dryness of the mouth and other mucous membranes. Glycopyrrolate is another drug sometimes used. It is said to be nearly as effective as oxybutynin, but has similar side-effects. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a glycopyrronium bromide- containing disposable cloth (brand name Qbrexza) for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. For peripheral hyperhidrosis, some chronic sufferers have found relief by simply ingesting crushed ice water. Ice water helps to cool excessive body heat during its transport through the blood vessels to the extremities, effectively lowering overall body temperature to normal levels within ten to thirty minutes. =Procedures= Injections of botulinum toxin type A can be used to block neural control of sweat glands. The effect can last from 3‚Äì9 months depending on the site of injections. This use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The duration of the beneficial effect in primary palmar hyperhidrosis has been found to increase with repetition of the injections. The Botox injections tend to be painful. Various measures have been tried to minimize the pain, one of which is the application of ice. This was first demonstrated by Khalaf Bushara and colleagues as the first nonmuscular use of BTX-A in 1993. BTX-A has since been approved for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating of unknown cause), which cannot be managed by topical agents. A microwave-based device has been tried for excessive underarm perspiration and appears to show promise. Tap water iontophoresis as a treatment for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis was originally described in the 1950s. Studies showed positive results and good safety with tap water iontophoresis. One trial found it decreased sweating by about 80%. =Surgery= Sweat gland removal or destruction is one surgical option available for axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm perspiration). There are multiple methods for sweat gland removal or destruction, such as sweat gland suction, retrodermal curettage, and axillary liposuction, Vaser, or Laser Sweat Ablation. Sweat gland suction is a technique adapted for liposuction. The other main surgical option is endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS), which cuts, burns, or clamps the thoracic ganglion on the main sympathetic chain that runs alongside the spine. Clamping is intended to permit the reversal of the procedure. ETS is generally considered a \\"safe, reproducible, and effective procedure and most patients are satisfied with the results of the surgery\\". Satisfaction rates above 80% have been reported, and are higher for children. The procedure brings relief from excessive hand sweating in about 85‚Äì95% of patients. ETS may be helpful in treating axillary hyperhidrosis, facial blushing and facial sweating, but failure rates in patients with facial blushing and/or excessive facial sweating are higher and such patients may be more likely to experience unwanted side effects. ETS side-effects have been described as ranging from trivial to devastating. The most common side-effect of ETS is compensatory sweating (sweating in different areas than prior to the surgery). Major problems with compensatory sweating are seen in 20‚Äì80% of patients undergoing the surgery. Most people find the compensatory sweating to be tolerable while 1‚Äì51% claim that their quality of life decreased as a result of compensatory sweating.\\" Total body perspiration in response to heat has been reported to increase after sympathectomy. The original sweating problem may recur due to nerve regeneration, sometimes as early as 6 months after the procedure. Other possible side-effects include Horner's Syndrome (about 1%), gustatory sweating (less than 25%) and excessive dryness of the palms (sandpaper hands). Some patients have experienced cardiac sympathetic denervation, which can result in a 10% decrease in heart rate both at rest and during exercise, resulting in decreased exercise tolerance. Percutaneous sympathectomy is a minimally invasive procedure similar to the botulinum method, in which nerves are blocked by an injection of phenol. The procedure provides temporary relief in most cases. Some physicians advocate trying this more conservative procedure before resorting to surgical sympathectomy, the effects of which are usually not reversible. Prognosis Hyperhidrosis can have physiological consequences such as cold and clammy hands, dehydration, and skin infections secondary to maceration of the skin. Hyperhidrosis can also have devastating emotional effects on one‚Äôs individual life. Those with hyperhidrosis may have greater stress levels and more frequent depression. Excessive sweating or focal hyperhidrosis of the hands interferes with many routine activities, such as securely grasping objects. Some focal hyperhidrosis sufferers avoid situations where they will come into physical contact with others, such as greeting a person with a handshake. Hiding embarrassing sweat spots under the armpits limits the sufferers' arm movements and pose. In severe cases, shirts must be changed several times during the day and require additional showers both to remove sweat and control body odor issues or microbial problems such as acne, dandruff, or athlete's foot. Additionally, anxiety caused by self-consciousness to the sweating may aggravate the sweating. Excessive sweating of the feet makes it harder for patients to wear slide-on or open-toe shoes, as the feet slide around in the shoe because of sweat. Some careers present challenges for people with hyperhidrosis. For example, careers that require the use of a knife may not be safely performed by people with excessive sweating of the hands. The risk of dehydration can limit the ability of some to function in extremely hot (especially if also humid) conditions. Even the playing of musical instruments can be uncomfortable or difficult because of sweaty hands. Epidemiology It is estimated that the incidence of focal hyperhidrosis may be as high as 2.8% of the population of the United States. It affects men and women equally, and most commonly occurs among people aged 25‚Äì64 years, though some may have been affected since early childhood. About 30‚Äì50% of people have another family member afflicted, implying a genetic predisposition. In 2006, researchers at Saga University in Japan reported that primary palmar hyperhidrosis maps to gene locus 14q11.2‚Äìq13.

Cooke & Sons and Troughton & Simms. Origins Thomas Cooke set up a business in York in 1837 making astronomical telescopes. One early notable instrument was a 4.5 inch equatorial refractor which would have been exceptional at the time. In 1851 Cooke built a 7.25 inch equatorial telescope. Cooke made the optical elements himself for both these instruments. Thomas Cooke built a reputation for high quality optics and, as well as smaller instruments, supplied large instruments to observatories around the world.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World, A History of Cooke, Troughton & Simms Pp. 50-68 From the outset in 1826 and earlier Troughton ans Simms of London excelled in the high precision work of dividing circles and so provided many observatories with large transit instruments and supplied national surveys such as the Ordnance Survey, with large transit theodolites.Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 6-49 Merger In 1922 with business in a depressed state Cooke and Troughton & Simms merged with head offices at York.

R. Watts and C. F. Casella & Co. On Dartmoor a comparison was made between the products of UK companies and their European competition, especially the Wild T2 theodolite which pioneered enclosed glass circles rather than exposed brass ones. Results were depressing for the British firms. One result of this event was the Vickers CTS \\"Tavistock\\" theodolite which appeared in 1930. Anita McConnell, Instrument Makers to the World Pp. 80-82 During the Second World War 3,300 people were employed by the company.Borthwick Institute for Archives, University of York Retrieved 23 November 2013 In 1963 it became a part of the new Vickers Instruments Ltd and they ceased trading in 1988. The Vickers V.22 theodolite was produced by CTS at this time. Upon closure all buildings on the site were demolished, leaving only the concrete foundations and as of October 2018, the site is still waiting to be redeveloped. Wartime Production At the end of the Second World War, a film entitled Cooke Troughton & Simms in Wartime 1939-1945 was released which documented the manufacturing processes used to produce many of the optical instruments which were used in tanks, aeroplanes and on ships.

Unlike a lid, which encloses a container from the outside without displacing the inner volume, a bung is partially or wholly inserted inside the container to act as a seal. A bung can be defined as \\"a plug or closure used to close an opening in a drum or barrel. Called a plug when referring to a steel drum closure.\\" A glass stopper is often called a \\"ground glass joint\\" (or \\"joint taper\\"), a rubber stopper is sometimes called a \\"rubber bung\\", and a cork stopper is called simply a \\"cork\\". Bung stoppers used for wine bottles are referred to as \\"corks\\", even when made from another material. A common every-day example of a bung is the cork of a wine bottle. Bungs are used to seal the bunghole of barrels. Other bungs, particularly those used in chemical barrels, may be made of metal and be screwed into place via threading. Ground glass joint Ground glass stoppers Ground glass joint (or ground glass stoppers) are commonly used with laboratory glassware, mainly because of their nonreactivity. Some stoppers used in labs have holes in them to allow the insertion of glass or rubber tubing. This is often used when a reaction is taking place in the flask or test tube and the byproduct or result of the reaction is desired to be collected. For instance, if one were to boil water in a test tube and wanted to collect the water vapor, one could seal the test tube with a stopper with holes in it. With tubing inserted into the hole(s), when the tube is heated, water vapor will rise through the hole, make its way through the tubing, and into the collection chamber of choice. The water vapor would not be able to escape into the air, because the stopper and the tubing, if set up correctly, would be airtight. Rubber bungs Cork stoppers from wine bottles. In chemistry, bungs made of hardened rubber are frequently used in small-scale experimental set-ups involving non-corrosive gases. Some chemistry bungs may also include one or more holes so a glass tube or laboratory funnel may be inserted through the bung and into the container or another piece of apparatus. The rubber bung may be used to seal a flask because the user may require the contents to be mixed via shaking the flask or may require that the contents be kept inside the flask and prevented from leaking out. In all cases, the bung keeps the experimentation environment sealed so that liquids or gases cannot escape (or enter). For applications that place higher demands on the bung in terms of temperature and mechanical stability or solvent resistance, standardized glass stoppers and connectors are preferred. Bottle stoppers made from gutta-percha, a natural rubber that is both chemically resistant and thermoplastic, were the first product of the Gutta Percha Company, better known for making submarine telegraph cable.Haigh, Kenneth Richardson, Cableships and Submarine Cables, pp. 26-27, Adlard Coles, 1968 .

Around the standing part When a stopper knot is tied outside another knot and around the standing part it can also be called a backup knot. Tying the end around the standing part helps prevent the knot from unraveling by not allowing the end to slide back into the knot: a kind of insurance against failure of the knot.

The genus is currently thought to contain three or four distinct species, known from incomplete fossil remains, found in western-central Europe (England, Belgium, France and Germany). More complete specimens are known from a fourth, North American species, which had previously been classified in the distinct genus Diatryma. Many scientists now consider Diatryma to be so similar to the other species of Gastornis that it should also be included in that genus. A fifth species, also previously classified in its own genus, is known from China. Gastornis species were very large birds, and have traditionally been considered to be predators of small mammals. However, several lines of evidence, including the lack of hooked claws in known Gastornis footprints and studies of their beak structure have caused scientists to reinterpret these birds as herbivores that probably fed on tough plant material and seeds. History Lemoine's incorrect 1881 illustration of G. eduardsii (now G. parisiensis) Gastornis was first described in 1855 from a fragmentary skeleton. It was named after Gaston Plant√©, described as a \\"studious young man full of zeal\\", who had discovered the first fossils in Argile Plastique formation deposits at Meudon near Paris. The discovery was notable due to the large size of the specimens, and because, at the time, Gastornis represented one of the oldest known birds.Buffetaut, E., and Burrrraur, E. (1997). \\"New remains of the giant bird Gastornis from the Upper Paleocene of the eastern Paris Basin and the relationships between Gastornis and Diatryma.\\" N. Jb. Geol. Pal√¢ont. Mh., (3): 179-190. Additional bones of the first known species, G. parisiensis, were found in the mid 1860s. Somewhat more complete specimens, this time referred to the new species G. eduardsii (now considered a synonym of G. parisiensis) were found a decade later. The specimens found in the 1870s formed the basis for a widely circulated and reproduced skeletal restoration by Lemoine. The skulls of these original Gastornis fossils were unknown except for nondescript fragments, and several bones used in Lemoine's illustration turned out to be those of other animals. Thus, the European bird was long reconstructed as a sort of gigantic crane-like bird. In 1874, the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope discovered another fragmentary set of fossils in the Wasatch Formation of New Mexico. He considered them to belong to a distinct genus and species of giant ground bird, which, in 1876, he named Diatryma gigantea ( ),The biologist's handbook of pronunciations (1960) from Ancient Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ¨œÑœÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±, diatrema, meaning ‚Äúthrough a hole‚Äù, referring to the large foramina (perforations) that penetrate some of the foot bones. A single gastornithid toe bone from New Jersey was described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1894 and classified as the new genus and species Barornis regens, but in 1911 it was recognized that this, too, could be considered a junior synonym of Diatryma (and therefore later Gastornis). Additional fragmentary specimens were found in Wyoming in 1911 and assigned in 1913 to the new species Diatryma ajax (also now considered a synonym of G. gigantea). In 1916, an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Bighorn Basin (Willwood Formation) of Wyoming found the first nearly complete skull and skeleton, which was described in 1917 and gave scientists their first clear picture of the bird. Matthew, Granger, and Stein (1917) classified this nearly complete specimen as yet another new species, Diatryma steini. Life restoration of G. steini (now G. gigantea) with outdated, ratite-like plumage, 1917 After the description of Diatryma, most new European specimens were referred to this genus instead of Gastornis. However, after the initial discovery of Diatryma, it soon became clear that it and Gastornis were so similar that the former could be considered a junior synonym of the latter. In fact, this similarity was recognized as early as 1884 by Elliott Coues, but this was debated by researchers throughout the 20th century. Meaningful comparisons between Gastornis and Diatryma were made more difficult by Lemoine's incorrect skeletal illustration, the composite nature of which was not discovered until the early 1980s. Following this, several authors began to recognize a greater degree of similarity between the European and North American birds, often placing both in the same order (Gastornithiformes) or even family (Gastornithidae). This newly recognized degree of similarity caused many scientists to tentatively accept their synonymy, pending a comprehensive review of the anatomy of these birds. Consequently, the correct scientific name of the genus is Gastornis. Description Restoration and size comparison Gastornis is known from a large amount of fossil remains, but the clearest picture of the bird comes from a few nearly complete specimens of the species G. gigantea. These were generally very large birds, with huge beaks and massive skulls superficially similar to the carnivorous South American \\"terror birds\\" (phorusrhacids). The largest known species, G. gigantea could grow to the size of the largest moas, and reached about in maximum height. The skull of G. gigantea was huge compared to the body and powerfully built. The beak was extremely tall and compressed (flattened from side to side). Unlike other species of Gastornis, G. gigantea lacked characteristic grooves and pits on the underlying bone. The 'lip' of the beak was straight, without a raptorial hook as found in the predatory phorusrhacids. The nostrils were small and positioned close to the front of the eyes about midway up the skull. The vertebrae were short and massive, even in the neck. The neck was relatively short, consisting of at least 13 massive vertebrae. The torso was relatively short. The wings were vestigial, with the upper wing-bones small and highly reduced, similar in proportion to the wings of the cassowary. Classification Gastornis and its close relatives are classified together in the family Gastornithidae, and were long considered to be members of the order Gruiformes. However, the traditional concept of Gruiformes has since been shown to be an unnatural grouping. Beginning in the late 1980s with the first phylogenetic analysis of gastornithid relationships, consensus began to grow that they were close relatives of the lineage that includes waterfowl and screamers, the Anseriformes. A 2007 study showed that gastornithids were a very early- branching group of anseriformes, and formed the sister group to all other members of that lineage.Agnolin, F. (2007). \\"Brontornis burmeisteri Moreno & Mercerat, un Anseriformes (Aves) gigante del Mioceno Medio de Patagonia, Argentina.\\" Revista del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, n.s. 9, 15-25 Recognizing the apparent close relationship between gastornithids and waterfowl, some researchers classify gastornithids within the anseriform group itself. Others restrict the name Anseriformes only to the crown group formed by all modern species, and label the larger group including extinct relatives of anseriformes, like the gastornithids, with the name Anserimorphae. Gastornithids are therefore sometimes placed in their own order, Gastornithiformes.Buffetaut, E. (2002). \\"Giant ground birds at the Cretaceous- Tertiary boundary: Extinction or survival?\\" Special papers - Geological Society of America, 303-306. A simplified version of the family tree found by Agnolin et al. in 2007 is reproduced below. Reconstructed G. geiselensis skeleton Today, at least five species of Gastornis are generally accepted as valid. The type species, Gastornis parisiensis, was named and described by H√©bert in two 1855 papers. It is known from fossils found in western and central Europe, dating from the late Paleocene to the early Eocene. Other species previously considered distinct, but which are now considered synonymous with G. parisiensis, include G. edwardsii (Lemoine, 1878) and G. klaasseni (Newton, 1885). Additional European species of Gastornis are G. russeli (Martin, 1992) from the late Paleocene of Berru, France, and G. sarasini (Schaub, 1929) from the early-middle Eocene. G. geiselensis, from the middle Eocene of Messel, Germany, has been considered a synonym of G. sarasini, however, other researchers have stated that there is currently insufficient evidence to synonymize the two, and that they should be kept separate at least pending a more detailed comparison of all gastornithids. The supposed small species G. minor is considered to be a nomen dubium. Gastornis gigantea (Cope, 1876), formerly Diatryma, dates from the middle Eocene of western North America. Its junior synonyms include Barornis regens (Marsh, 1894) and Omorhamphus storchii (Sinclair, 1928). O. storchii was described based on fossils from lower Eocene rocks of Wyoming. The species was named in honor of T. C. von Storch, who found the fossils remains in Princeton 1927 Expedition. The fossil bones originally described as Omorhamphus storchii are now considered to be the remains of a juvenile Gastornis gigantea. Specimen YPM PU 13258 from lower Eocene Willwood Formation rocks of Park County, Wyoming also seems to be a juvenile ‚Äì perhaps also of G. gigantea, in which case it would be an even younger individual. Gastornis xichuanensis, from the early Eocene of Henan, China, is known only from a tibiotarsus (upper foot bone). It was originally described in 1980 as the only species in the distinct genus Zhongyuanus. However, a re-evaluation of the fossil published in 2013 concluded that the differences between this specimen and the same bone in Gastornis species were minor, and that it should be considered an asian species of Gastornis. Paleobiology =Diet= Skull and mandible of G. gigantea specimen AMNH 6169 A long-standing debate surrounding Gastornis is the interpretation of its diet. It has often been depicted as a predator of contemporary small mammals, which famously included the early horse Eohippus. However, with the size of Gastornis legs, the bird would have had to have been more agile to catch fast-moving prey than the fossils suggest it to have been. Consequently, Gastornis has been suspected to have been an ambush hunter and/or used pack hunting techniques to pursue or ambush prey; if Gastornis was a predator, it would have certainly needed some other means of hunting prey through the dense forest. Alternatively, it could have used its strong beak for eating large or strong vegetation. The skull of Gastornis is massive in comparison to those of living ratites of similar body size. Biomechanical analysis of the skull suggests that the jaw-closing musculature was enormous. The lower jaw is very deep, resulting in a lengthened moment arm of the jaw muscles. Both features strongly suggest that Gastornis could generate a powerful bite. Some scientists have proposed that the skull of Gastornis was ‚Äòoverbuilt‚Äô for a herbivorous diet and support the traditional interpretation of Gastornis as a carnivore that used its powerfully constructed beak to subdue struggling prey and crack open bones to extract marrow. Others have noted the apparent lack of predatory features in the skull, such as a prominently hooked beak, as evidence that Gastornis was a specialized herbivore (or even an omnivore) of some sort, perhaps having used its large beak to crack hard foods like nuts and seeds. Footprints attributed to gastornithids (possibly a species of Gastornis itself), described in 2012, showed that these birds lacked strongly hooked talons on the hind legs, another line of evidence suggesting that they did not have a predatory lifestyle. Recent evidence suggests that Gastornis was likely a true herbivore. Studies of the calcium isotopes in the bones of specimens of Gastornis by Thomas Tutken and colleagues showed no evidence that it had meat in its diet. The geochemical analysis further revealed that its dietary habits were similar to those of both herbivorous dinosaurs and mammals when it was compared to known fossil carnivores, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, leaving phorusrhacids as the only major carnivorous flightless birds. =Eggs= In Late Paleocene deposits of Spain and early Eocene deposits of France, shell fragments of huge eggs have turned up, namely in Provence. These were described as the ootaxon Ornitholithus and are presumably from Gastornis. While no direct association exists between Ornitholithus and Gastornis fossils, no other birds of sufficient size are known from that time and place; while the large Diogenornis and Eremopezus are known from the Eocene, the former lived in South America (still separated from North America by the Tethys Ocean then) and the latter is only known from the Late Eocene of North Africa, which also was separated by an (albeit less wide) stretch of the Tethys Ocean from Europe. Some of these fragments were complete enough to reconstruct a size of 24 by 10 cm (about 9.5 by 4 inches) with shells 2.3‚Äì2.5 mm (0.09‚Äì0.1 in) thick, roughly half again as large as an ostrich egg and very different in shape from the more rounded ratite eggs. If Remiornis is indeed correctly identified as a ratite (which is quite doubtful, however), Gastornis remains as the only known animal that could have laid these eggs. At least one species of Remiornis is known to have been smaller than Gastornis, and was initially described as Gastornis minor by Ml√≠kovsk√Ω in 2002. This would nicely match the remains of eggs a bit smaller than those of the living ostrich, which have also been found in Paleogene deposits of Provence, were it not for the fact that these eggshell fossils also date from the Eocene, but no Remiornis bones are yet known from that time. =Footprints= Skeletal restoration of G. gigantea Several sets of fossil footprints are suspected to belong to Gastornis. One set of footprints was reported from late Eocene gypsum at Montmorency and other locations of the Paris Basin in the 19th century, from 1859 onwards. Described initially by Jules Desnoyers, and later on by Alphonse Milne-Edwards, these trace fossils were celebrated among French geologists of the late 19th century. They were discussed by Charles Lyell in his Elements of Geology as an example of the incompleteness of the fossil record ‚Äì no bones had been found associated with the footprints. Unfortunately, these fine specimens, which sometimes even preserved details of the skin structure, are now lost. They were brought to the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle when Desnoyers started to work there, and the last documented record of them deals with their presence in the geology exhibition of the MNHN in 1912. The largest of these footprints, although only consisting of a single toe's impression, was 40 cm (16 in) long. The large footprints from the Paris Basin could also be divided into huge and merely large examples, much like the eggshells from southern France, which are 20 million years older. Another footprint record consists of a single imprint that still exists, though it has proven to be even more controversial. It was found in late Eocene Puget Group rocks in the Green River valley near Black Diamond, Washington. After its discovery, it raised considerable interest in the Seattle area in May‚ÄìJuly 1992, being subject of at least two longer articles in the Seattle Times. Variously declared a hoax or genuine, this apparent impression of a single bird foot measures about 27 cm wide by 32 cm long (11 by 13 in) and lacks a hallux (hind toe); it was described as the ichnotaxon Ornithoformipes controversus. Fourteen years after the initial discovery, the debate about the find's authenticity was still unresolved. The specimen is now at Western Washington University.Supposed Gastornis feathers which turned out to be plant materialThe problem with these early trace fossils is that no fossil of Gastornis has been found to be younger than about 45 million years. The enigmatic \\"Diatryma\\" cotei is known from remains almost as old as the Paris basin footprints (whose date never could be accurately determined), but in North America the fossil record of unequivocal gastornithids seems to end even earlier than in Europe. However, in 2009, a landslide near Bellingham, Washington exposed at least 18 tracks on 15 blocks in the Eocene Chuckanut Formation. The anatomy and age (about 53.7 Ma old) of the tracks suggest that the track maker was Gastornis. Although these birds have long been considered to be predators or scavengers, the absence of raptor-like claws supports earlier suggestions that they were herbivores. The Chuckanut tracks are named as the ichnotaxon Rivavipes giantess, inferred to belong to the extinct family Gastornithidae. At least 10 of the tracks are on display at Western Washington University. =Feathers= Drawing of probable Gastornis feather from the alt= The plumage of Gastornis has generally been depicted in art as a hair-like covering similar to some ratites. This has been based in part on some fibrous strands recovered from a Green River Formation deposit at Roan Creek, Colorado, which were initially believed to represent Gastornis feathers and named Diatryma filifera. Subsequent examination has shown the supposed feathers were actually not feathers at all, but plant fibers. However, a second possible Gastornis feather has since been identified, also from the Green River Formation. Unlike the filamentous plant material, this single isolated feather resembles the body feathers of flighted birds, being broad and vaned. It was tentatively identified as a possible Gastornis feather based on its size; the feather measured long and must have belonged to a gigantic bird.Grande, L. (2013). The Lost World of Fossil Lake: Snapshots from Deep Time. University of Chicago Press. Distribution Life restoration of G. gigantea, a species found in North America Gastornis fossils are known from across western Europe, the western United States, and central China. The earliest (Paleocene) fossils all come from Europe, and it is likely that the genus originated there. Europe in this epoch was an island continent, and Gastornis was the largest terrestrial tetrapod of the landmass. This offers parallels with the malagasy elephant birds, herbivorous birds that were similarly the largest land animals in the isolated landmass of Madagascar, in spite of otherwise mammalian megafauna. All other fossil remains are from the Eocene; however, it is not currently known how Gastornis dispersed out of Europe and into North America and Asia. Given the presence of Gastornis fossils in the early Eocene of western China, these birds may have spread east from Europe and crossed into North America via the Bering land bridge. Gastornis also may have spread both east and west, arriving separately in eastern Asia and in North America across the Turgai Strait. Direct landbridges with North America are also known. European Gastornis survived somewhat longer than their North American and Asian counterparts. This seems to coincide with a period of increased isolation of the continent. Extinction The extinction of Gastornis is currently unclear. Competition with mammals has often been cited as a possible factor, but Gastornis did occur in faunas dominated by mammals, and did co-exist with several megafaunal forms like pantodonts. Likewise, extreme climatic events like the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) appear to have had little impact. Nonetheless, the extended survival in Europe is thought to coincide with increased isolation of the landmass.

It is the moment when minors cease to be considered such and assume legal control over their persons, actions, and decisions, thus terminating the control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian over them. Most countries set the age of majority at 18, but some jurisdictions have a higher age and others lower. The word majority here refers to having greater years and being of full age as opposed to minority, the state of being a minor. The law in a given jurisdiction may not actually use the term \\"age of majority\\". The term typically refers to a collection of laws bestowing the status of adulthood. Those under the age of majority are referred to as minors and may be legally denied certain privileges such as voting, buying and drinking alcoholic beverages, buying tobacco or cannabis products, gambling, marrying, buying or owning firearms, owning property, entering into binding contracts, or getting full driving privileges. Age of majority should not be confused with the age of maturity, age of sexual consent, marriageable age, school-leaving age, drinking age, driving age, voting age, smoking age, gambling age, etc., which each may be independent of and set at a different age from the age of majority. Explanation Age of majority can be confused with the similar concept of the age of license, which also pertains to the threshold of adulthood but in a much broader and more abstract way. As a legal term of art, \\"license\\" means \\"permission\\", and it can implicate a legally enforceable right or privilege. Thus, an age of license is an age at which one has legal permission from government to do something. The age of majority, on the other hand, is legal recognition that one has grown into an adult. Age of majority pertains solely to the acquisition of legal control over one's person, decisions and actions, and the correlative termination of the legal authority of the parents (or guardian(s), in lieu of parent(s)) over the child's person and affairs generally. Many ages of license are correlated to the age of majority, but they are nonetheless legally distinct concepts. One need not have attained the age of majority to have permission to exercise certain rights and responsibilities. Some ages of license are actually higher than the age of majority. For example, to purchase alcoholic beverages, the age of license is 21 in all U.S. states. Another example is the voting age, which prior to the 1970s was 21 in the US, as was the age of majority in all or most states. In the Republic of Ireland the age of majority is 18, but one must be over 21 years of age to stand for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Also, in Portugal the age of majority is 18, but one must be at least 25 years of age to run for public office and 35 years of age to run for president. A child who is legally emancipated by a court of competent jurisdiction automatically attains to their maturity upon the signing of the court order. Only emancipation confers the status of maturity before a person has actually reached the age of majority. In almost all places, minors who are married are automatically emancipated. Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma. The age 18 is identified as the age of adulthood in the Jewish Talmud relative to having sound judgement to make monetary decisions as a judge. Here, the Talmud says that every judgment Josiah, the sixteenth king of Judah (c. 640‚Äì609) issued from the age of eight, when he was crowned, until the age of eighteen was reversed and he returned the money to the parties whom he judged liable, due to concern that in his youth he may not have judged the cases correctly. Other Jewish commentators have discussed whether age 13 or 18 is the age to make decisions in a Jewish Court. Civil law In many countries minors can be emancipated: depending on jurisdiction, this may happen through acts such as marriage, attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational degree or diploma, or participating in a form of military service.

It was established in November 1867 at the confluence of the Concho Rivers and on the Butterfield Overland Mail Route and Goodnight‚ÄìLoving Trail. At its height during the American Indian Wars, Fort Concho consisted of 40 buildings on of land leased by the US Army. The fort was abandoned in June 1889 and fell into civilian hands. Over the next twenty years, its buildings were used as residences or recycled for their material in the nearby town of San Angelo. Beginning in the late 1920s, a serious effort has been made to preserve and restore Fort Concho by its eponymous museum organization, founded in 1929. The property has been owned and operated by the city of San Angelo since 1935. It was named a National Historic Landmark on 4 July 1961. Fort Concho is one of the best-preserved examples of the military installations built by the US Army in the state of Texas. Over its 22-year career as a US Army base, Fort Concho housed elements of fifteen US Cavalry and Infantry regiments, most prominently the \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" of the 9th and 10th Cavalry and 24th and 25th Infantry regiments. From its establishment in 1867 until 1875, Fort Concho was the principal base of the 4th Cavalry and then of the 10th Cavalry from 1875 to 1882. From 1878 to 1881, the fort was the headquarters of the short-lived District of the Pecos, and troops stationed at Fort Concho participated in Ranald S. Mackenzie's 1872 summer campaign, the Red River War in 1874, and the Victorio Campaign of 1879‚Äì1880. Operation by the US military Western cattle trails from 1866 to 1890. The Goodnight- Loving Trail is the farthest west of these and runs through the Concho valley and Fort Concho. Conflict in the Texas region between Native American tribes and white settlers spanned over 300 years, beginning in the early 16th century with Spanish missionaries and soldiers and ending with the cessation of organized resistance to the government of the United States of America in the 1870s. In the area that is now Concho Valley, the Jumano people established a village on the North Concho River sometime before 1534, when Cabeza de Vaca stayed there. Franciscan friars established a mission there between 1629 to 1632 and were joined in the 1650s by traders from Santa Fe. In the 1690s, the Jumanos were driven out of the region by the Apache, who themselves were pushed southwest by the Comanche in the mid-18th century. With America's victory over Mexico in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in the 1830s and the 1849 discovery of gold in California, American colonists began crossing Comancheria. The native Comanche, Kiowa, and Kickapoo peoples fiercely resisted them. To protect its citizens, the United States Army's Department of Texas surveyed the frontier by 1851 and built a string of forts along principal routes of travel. In March 1852, American troops established a camp on the North Concho that was abandoned with the establishment, in October 1852, of Fort Chadbourne on a tributary of the nearby Colorado River. Patrols launched from the fort still covered the Concho valley and the Butterfield Overland Mail route, established in 1858. This phase of frontier history ended three years later with the beginning of the American Civil War. Fort Chadbourne, like other Texas forts, was abandoned by Federal troops until the surrender of the Confederacy. During this time, the frontier receded to the east and the Comanche were emboldened into increased raiding. With the establishment in 1866 of the Goodnight-Loving Trail, which followed the Middle Concho River west, there came an increased need to protect cattlemen and settlers traveling around the Concho valley. To this end, the 4th Cavalry, commanded by Major John P. Hatch, reoccupied Fort Chadbourne in May 1867. This was soon followed up by plans to establish an outpost on the Concho, where US troops and citizens would have a reliable and inexhaustible supply of water. In the summer of 1867, Hatch ordered Lieutenant Peter M. Boehm to establish a camp on the Middle Concho, south of Fort Chadbourne. Captain Michael J. Kelly and 50 troops established this camp that summer, but on the North Concho, and remained there for the duration of the summer. A committee of officers including Hatch surveyed the North and Middle Concho rivers in September 1867 and chose a plateau at the junction of the three Conchos for its grazing grounds, the abundance of nearby limestone, and inexhaustible supply of fresh water. On 28 November 1867, the 4th Cavalry's H Company departed from Fort Chadbourne for the site to establish the outpost. H Company's commander, Captain George G. Huntt, named the site \\"Camp Hatch\\", but changed it to \\"Camp Kelly\\" in January 1868 at Hatch's request to honor Kelly, who had died of typhoid fever on 13 August 1867. Fort Concho, then under construction north of Camp Kelly, received its name in March 1868 from Edward M. Stanton, Secretary of War for the United States. The land Fort Concho was built on was not bought by the US government, but leased. =Construction= Construction of Fort Concho was assigned on 10 December 1867 to Captain David W. Porter, assistant quartermaster of the Department of Texas. He brought in civilian stonemasons and carpenters to construct first temporary storehouses and then a permanent commissary in January 1868. Porter, also responsible for constructing Forts Griffin and Richardson, was replaced in March by Major George C. Cram, who built a temporary guardhouse. Construction was slow, as direction had been poor under Cram and his predecessor, who was rarely at Fort Concho. By Spring 1868, the only permanent building on-site was a sutler's store, constructed from pickets and pecan rafters. The soldiers lived in tents heated by fireplaces and sometimes stoves or in timber huts. As at other forts, they also built temporary timber frame or picket buildings lined with canvas insulation. Over 1868, Cram began a dispute with Major Ben Ficklin, the regional mail line superintendent, that resulted in Cram's having Ficklin arrested. The Postmaster General soon became involved and by August Cram was reassigned out of the Concho valley. He was replaced with Major George A. Gordon, who handed Fort Concho's construction to Captain Joseph Rendlebrock, the 4th Cavalry's quartermaster. By the end of 1868, Rendlebrock had completed the commissary, quartermaster's storehouse, and a wing of the hospital. Like Porter, Rendlebrock employed civilian masons and carpenters, mostly German immigrants from Fredericksburg. The first permanent military structures on the fort grounds, five of the officer's residences and the first regimental barracks, were completed by August 1869. As officers began moving into the completed buildings, the non-commissioned officers, baker, drum major, and chief musician continued to live in temporary housing. In October 1869, a timber frame building was put up for the post adjutant and quartermaster on the parade ground. Over 1870, two more officer's residences and another barracks were built, as well as a permanent guardhouse and stables. Hatch pushed for the completion of the fort through 1870‚Äì71, directing the building of a quartermaster's corral, a wagon shed, and a failed attempt at producing adobe bricks that earned him the moniker \\"Dobe\\". Construction was again slowed in February 1872 with the discharging of most of the civilian workforce following budget cuts to the US War Department, but by the end of the year Fort Concho consisted of four barracks, eight officers' residences, the hospital, a magazine, stone guardhouse, bakery, several storehouses, workshops, and stables. In 1875, the parade ground was cleared and a flagstaff placed in its center. In the process, the adjutant's office was moved to the headquarters building. It was replaced in short order with a stone command structure, the Headquarters building, built in 1876. Another officers' residence was built in 1877, as were the foundations for another that went unfinished for lack of funding. This building was completed in February 1879 as the schoolhouse and chapel. It was the final permanent structure completed at Fort Concho. By 1879, the fort was an eight-company installation of entirely limestone-built structures with a parade ground measuring long by wide. Construction had cost the US Army 1 million dollars by May 1877. =Base of the 4th Cavalry= Historical marker detailing the service life of Fort Concho The first act undertaken by the 4th Cavalry when establishing Fort Concho was to build a wagon road to the San Saba River to secure a supply route from Fort Mason. When not on construction details, the garrison patrolled, scouted, and escorted wagon trains on the Butterfield Overland Trail and San Antonio‚ÄìEl Paso Road and cattle herds. Encounters with hostile Native Americans were rare. On 25 February 1871, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie took command of the 4th Cavalry. He moved the regimental headquarters to Fort Richardson a month later, but kept a few companies at Fort Concho. In May 1871, the 4th Cavalry contingent left at Fort Concho participated in a campaign against the Kiowa in retaliation for the Warren Wagon Train raid with troops from Forts Griffin and Sill. Six troops of 4th Cavalry's I Company, commanded by Captain Napoleon B. McLaughlen, joined the rest of the regiment at the Little Wichita River in pursuit of the Kiowa but turned back for Fort Concho in September after the raiders escaped. Comanche and Kiowa raids increased in number over early 1873, prompting a number of expeditions that rarely saw Native Americans. A notable exception was a patrol carried out by Sergeant William Wilson from 26 to 29 March 1872. On 28 March, his patrol fought a group of Comancheros, half-Native and Hispanic traders, and captured one of their number. The captured man, Apalonio Ortiz, revealed that there was water in the Staked Plains and the location of a large Comanche settlement and base of trade for the Comancheros at Mushaway Peak. Hatch, in charge of Fort Concho while Mackenzie was in the field, reported Wilson's findings to Mackenzie and to the Departments of Texas and New Mexico. McLaughlen set out again with two companies of the 4th Cavalry and one of the 11th Infantry to verify Ortiz's information and confirmed it. His expedition, which had also mapped some of the Staked Plains, returned on 13 May. After Mackenzie and Hatch met with General Christopher C. Augur, Commander of the Department of Texas, Mackenzie and McLaughlen, commanding Companies D and I, departed from their respective installations on 17 June. Over the following months, the 4th Cavalry explored the South Plains and fought the Comanche at the Battle of the North Fork of the Red River on 29 September. As a result of the battle, the 4th Cavalry captured 124 women and children and most of the horses of the involved Comanche warriors. The following night, the Comanche stole back some of their horses and escaped, but left their women and children as prisoners. Companies D and I returned to Fort Concho on 21 October with 116 of the noncombatants, who were interned in the quartermaster's corral. They remained in captivity at the fort until the Department of Texas ordered the release of the Comanche hostages on 14 April 1873. They departed Fort Concho on 24 May under escort from the 11th Infantry and arrived safely at Fort Sill on 10 June. In March 1873, Mackenzie moved the 4th Cavalry's command from Fort Concho to Fort Clark. That year, he embarked on another campaign, this time against the Kickapoo based across the Rio Grande in Mexico. Company I and McLaughlen again joined Mackenzie in the field for his attack into Coahuila, Mexico on 18 May 1873. On 27 June 1874, more than 200 Comanche warriors attacked a group of buffalo hunters camped at Adobe Walls, beginning the Red River War. In response, Augur ordered Mackenzie and the 4th Cavalry back to Fort Concho in July. When the US Army asked for permission to follow the Comanche and their allies onto reservations, the Secretary of War granted it. By August, General Philip H. Sheridan, commanding the Military Division of the Missouri, ordered five expeditionary forces of more than 3,000 soldiers into the South Plains. The southern force, under Mackenzie, left Fort Concho on 23 August 1874 with eight companies of the 4th Cavalry, four of the 10th Infantry, and one from the 11th Infantry. Over the course of the war, Mackenzie chased the Comanche until he found their base of operations in the Palo Duro Canyon and destroyed it on 28 September. His force continued to patrol the area over the winter, preventing the Comanche from rebuilding their supplies and cementing the American victory in the Red River War. Left no other option, the Comanche returned to their reservation. =Base of the 10th Cavalry= Texas State Historical Association placard commemorating the 10th Cavalry In early 1875, the 4th Cavalry was entirely transferred out of Fort Concho to Fort Sill to watch over the Comanche and were replaced by Fort Sill's previous garrison, the 10th Cavalry, commanded by Colonel Benjamin Grierson. Grierson and his \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" arrived at Fort Concho on 17 April 1875 and established the regimental headquarters there. The 10th Cavalry took up the duties the 4th Cavalry previously held: patrolling the frontier, escorting wagons and settlers, and mounting expeditions. One of these was Captain Nicholas M. Nolan's disastrous expedition in July 1877. Four men of the 10th Cavalry's Company A died on the trip by the time it returned to Fort Concho on 31 July. Apache raids from the Mescalero and San Carlos reservations in the mid-1870s prompted the creation of the District of the Pecos in January 1878. This was placed under Grierson's command and based at Fort Concho. Over the next two years, Grierson established outposts like Grierson Spring across West Texas. In October 1879, Grierson received word that a war party of Ojo Caliente and Mescalero Apache under Chief Victorio entered the Trans-Pecos. He left Fort Concho on 23 March 1880 at the head of five companies of the 10th Cavalry and some of the 25th Infantry to disarm the Mescaleros of the Fort Stanton reservation. Grierson's soldiers fought with Apache raiders over early April, then reached Fort Stanton on 12 April. The disarmament was delayed until 16 April because of rains, and resulted in failure when the Mescalero Apache escaped with most of their arms. Grierson returned to Fort Concho on 16 May but left the 10th Cavalry's M Company at the head of the North Concho in case the Apache appeared in the area. On 17 June 1880, Nolan and a battalion of the 10th Cavalry at Fort Sill returned to Fort Concho by Grierson's order. Ten days later, Grierson sent Nolan to patrol the Guadalupe Mountains and himself set out from Fort Concho on 10 July. Grierson harried Victorio over the summer until Victorio was defeated at Rattlesnake Springs and driven into Mexico. There, Victorio's band was destroyed on 15 October 1880 by Mexican soldiers under the command of Colonel Joaqu√≠n Terrazas. The 10th Cavalry left Fort Concho for the last time in July 1882 for Fort Davis, farther to the west. =Post-Texas Indian Wars and deactivation= On 27 January 1881, the Texas Rangers fought and defeated what was left of Victorio's band in the final battle of the American Indian Wars fought in Texas. The District of the Pecos was disbanded the following month. In August 1882, the 10th Cavalry was replaced at Fort Concho by the 16th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alfred L. Hough. Ten days before Hough and the regimental headquarters arrived at the fort, a massive flood of the Concho wiped Ben Ficklin off the map and badly damaged San Angelo. As a result, the 16th Infantry spent its first week on-site rendering humanitarian aid. After recovering, San Angelo began to prosper while Fort Concho declined from poor maintenance. From 1882 until the fort's final closure, it served primarily as a base for troops awaiting transfer elsewhere in Texas. When Fort McKavett was abandoned by the US Army in June 1883, its garrison moved to Fort Concho. By the mid-1880s, the ranches that now enclosed the surrounding plains with barbed wire fencing reduced the soldiers, barred by law from cutting the wire, to patrolling roads. Many of the frontier forts, such as Forts Davis and Griffin, had either been abandoned or were awaiting deactivation. After the 16th Infantry left Fort Concho for Fort Bliss in February 1887, it was believed locally that Fort Concho would also be abandoned. In early 1888, the 8th Cavalry gathered at Fort Concho from around Texas and then left for Fort Meade, in South Dakota, in June. With their departure, only the 19th Infantry's K Company were garrisoned at Fort Concho. Later that same year, on 17 September, the Santa Fe Railroad reached San Angelo. Interested locals appealed in vain to the Federal Government to make Fort Concho a permanent installation. On 20 June 1889, the men of K Company lowered the flag over the fort for the final time and left the next morning. Relationship with San Angelo, Texas Immigrants and their wagons passing through San Angelo in 1885 Bartholomew J. DeWitt borrowed $1500 from Marcus Koenigheim, a San Antonio-based investor and used it to buy a half- section of land on the opposite side of the Concho River of Fort Concho in 1870. He divided the area into plots to build a town, which he named Saint Angela (changed to San Angelo in 1881) after his wife, Carolina Angela de la Garza. The township was not a profitable venture. When Ben Ficklin was made the seat for Tom Green County instead of San Angelo, Koenigheim asked for payment of the balance and interest of DeWitt's loan in full. When he was unable to pay, Koenigheim sued him in 1875 and was awarded the of land that constituted the town. By then, San Angelo was a collection of saloons and brothels and had a reputation befitting that. Relations between the town and Fort Concho's garrison, who called San Angelo \\"the town over the river\\", were tentative. The enlisted men often spent and money in the town, but its inhabitants treated the garrison's black soldiers with racist disdain and violence. When one of the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry was murdered on 31 January 1881, an entire company of the 16th Infantry and the slain man's comrades arrested the sheriff on 2 February and demanded the murderer. He was not given up, but the soldiers returned to the fort without incident. Two days later, and acting on rumors that the murderer had been released, the soldiers returned and attacked the Nimitz Hotel, where he was rumored to be staying. The Texas Rangers arrived to help calm the situation and did this by issuing threats to attack the fort and to shoot any soldier that crossed the Concho River in a ten-day period. Tension existed between the civilians and Fort Concho until after the 10th Cavalry left in 1882 and was replaced by the 16th Infantry. The aid rendered to locals by the fort's garrison, especially the 16th Infantry, following the flood of 1888 and fires in the vicinity eventually evaporated the lingering animosity. Fort Concho was crucial to San Angelo's early growth. The presence of its garrison attracted traders and settlers and allowed diversification of the town's economy. Some of the sutlers that supplied Fort Concho's troops were William S. Veck, one of the organizers of Tom Green County and owner of San Angelo's first bank, and James L. Millspaugh, another county commissioner who helped bring the railroad to San Angelo. When the fort was abandoned, the local economy suffered enough to cause the closing of Koenigheim's business in San Angelo. Fort Concho's chaplains were some of the first preachers and educators in the town. The medical staff, chiefly surgeon William Notson, treated not just the garrison but also civilian townsfolk and ranchers. One of Notson's civilian assistants, Samuel L.S. Smith, became San Angelo's first physician and in 1910 helped establish its first civilian hospital. =Preservation= In the last years of the 19th century, the post buildings became residences for the people of San Angelo. Enlisted Barracks 3 and 4 fell into ruin and were replaced with a series of residences while the officer's residences were preserved as private homes. However, despite a state of general disrepair, effort was still made by interested locals to preserve Fort Concho. When C.A. Broome formed the Fort Concho Realty Company in 1905 to sell off his land in San Angelo and at Fort Concho, he implored the city to buy the fort for $15,000 without success. The eastern third of the fort grounds, which had remained preserved, was given to the city by the Santa Fe Railroad Company in 1913. A decade later, the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution tried and failed to raise funds to preserve the fort. Instead, a stone and bronze plaque was placed that is still present at the fort. In 1928, Ginevra Wood Carson founded the West Texas Museum in a room of the Tom Green County Courthouse. The next year, she raised funds for and made a purchase of the Headquarters for $6000. Over 1930, she moved the museum into the building and renamed it the Fort Concho Museum. The city of San Angelo assumed partial administrative responsibility for the museum in 1935, then fully annexed the museum in 1955. Fort Concho was named a National Historic Landmark on 4 July 1961, bringing federal resources and trained professionals to Fort Concho. A three-phase plan was presented to the National Park Service in 1967 for the acquisition, preservation, and restoration of the fort site and the funding required. Restorations followed in the 1970s, culminating in a 1980 plan by an Austin-based architectural firm. By the end of the 1980s, the Fort Concho Museum complex consisted of sixteen original buildings, six reconstructed buildings, and a stabilized ruin. =Recent history= On 3 April 2008, following a call from an alleged victim of abuse by members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a polygamist Mormon sect, Texas authorities raided the YFZ Ranch. The authorities began removing children from the ranch the next day, and relocated them to Fort Concho on 5 April. The State of Texas was granted conservatorship over the children on 7 April, and seven days later moved all women accompanying children older than five years to the Foster Communications Coliseum, also in San Angelo. On 2 June, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the seizure of the children was unlawful, and the children were released from state custody. Late in 2017, the Fort Concho Museum announced its plans for 2018, funded by the city of San Angelo and private donors. These included the expansion of the visitor's center into the entirety of Barracks 1 and 2, and the reconstruction of Barracks 3 and 4 as well as their mess halls. Grounds and architecture Fort Concho was constructed from limestone quarried south of the fort, which supplied lime for the mortar mixture also used in its construction. Most of the wood used in the fort's construction was shipped from the Gulf Coast, as the native pecan and mesquite trees were unsuitable for construction. The landmark today includes most of the original fort and 23 main structures, mostly original or restored, but some reconstructions. These structures include a headquarters, officers' quarters, soldiers' barracks, and the post hospital. Regular and changing exhibits in the fields of military history, the heritage of San Angelo and West Texas in general, and the daily life of a soldier and an officer are on display.Texas Department of Transportation, Texas State Travel Guide, 2007, p. 112 The Fort Concho Museum has over 35,000 items related to the histories of Fort Concho and San Angelo in its collection. =Barracks Row= Enlisted Men's Barracks 1 and 2. Note the boarded-up sally port in the center of Barracks 2 The enlisted men's barracks were some of the first buildings erected at Fort Concho, from 1869 to 1872. Civilian laborers provided skilled labor such as carpentry while soldiers performed the construction work. Barracks 1 and 2 were built in 1869 and 1870, respectively, and each contained two cavalry companies. Both structures are unique in having sally ports in the middle of the structures to allow the soldiers to lead their horses through, rather than around, the barracks to reach the stables, located behind the buildings. Barracks 1 is currently the visitor's center while Barracks 2 is a display space housing wagons and replica artillery pieces such as a Gatling gun. The other four barracks buildings were built to house infantrymen and had an attached mess hall. Barracks 3 and 4 were completed by the end of 1872 but were demolished some time after the fort was abandoned. Barracks 5 and 6 are living history spaces and are furnished to appear as they would have during Fort Concho's military career. At the end of Barracks Row was a guardhouse, built in 1870 to replace an earlier, temporary structure. =Eastern row= Post Hospital, from the parade ground. Left is north, right is south. The commissary, started in January 1868, is the oldest building at Fort Concho and in the city of San Angelo. The headquarters building was built in 1876 by order of Colonel Grierson and served as the command building for the fort until its deactivation in 1889. From 1878 to 1881, the building was the headquarters for the District of the Pecos, which included Forts Davis, Stockton, and Griffin. In addition to the adjutant's office, which it replaced, the headquarters housed the court martial, and the 10th Cavalry's regimental headquarters. Another addition was a library of 292 books established by Chaplain Norman Badger in late 1873. By the end of 1875, the library had grown to 720 books. The headquarters building was used in various capacities in the twenty years after the US Army left Fort Concho. In 1929, Ginevra Wood Carson purchased the building and moved the West Texas Museum into the building. Four of the rooms on the ground floor, the court martial, orderly's room, adjutant's office, and regimental headquarters, have been remodeled to appear as they would have during the fort's military career. The post hospital was one of the earliest buildings at the fort, built from 1868 to 1870 according to the same plan of Fort Richardson's hospital. During Fort Concho's military operation, its hospital served both military and civilian patients but had few supplies and was unsanitary. After the fort's deactivation the hospital was used as a rooming house and for storage until it was destroyed by fire in 1911. The building was rebuilt in the mid-1980s with the aid of architectural and historical records. Presently, the hospital contains a museum about frontier medicine in its north ward, a library in the south ward, and general medical exhibits in the center. The residence of Oscar Ruffini, San Angelo's first civic architect, was moved to the far east side of the fort grounds on 14 May 1951. =Officers' Row= Officer's Quarters 3 from the northwest. The officers' quarters were built in several phases from 1869 to the mid-1870s. These buildings were assigned by rank, regardless of the size of an officer's family. In 1879, Grierson had a water pipe laid behind the Officers' Quarters leading to a pump on the parade ground for horticultural use. Officer's Quarters 1 was the residence of the fort commander from its completion in 1872, replacing Officer's Quarters 3 in that capacity. Benjamin Grierson was the commanding officer who lived there the longest, from 1875 to 1882. Grierson added the west office, kitchen, and carriage house and placed locks on every door in the building. Grierson's daughter Edith of typhoid died in the building on 9 September 1878. The Fort Concho Museum purchased the building in 1964 and it served for years as the meeting place of the Tom Green County Historical Society. Officer's Quarters 1 was renovated in 1994 and became the Concho Valley Pioneer Heritage Center. Until the completion of Officer's Quarters 1 in 1872, Officer's Quarters 3 was the home of Fort Concho's commander. This building may also have been first of the officers' residences to be completed, in 1870. Because Officer's Quarters 3 had the greatest abundance of original interior fabric, it was restored to appear as it would have in the 1870s. The schoolhouse, also functioning as a chapel, was the last permanent structure to be built at Fort Concho. The structure was begun in November 1872 as another officer's residence, but only the foundation and basement of the kitchen were completed. When funding for construction was slashed, it was decided that instead a schoolhouse and chapel would be built instead for the education of the garrison's black soldiers and religious ceremonies. Both of these had been held in various places around the fort. Chaplain Badger had requested, fruitlessly, the construction of a permanent chapel and for want of such a building built a picket and sod chapel. Badger died at the fort on 3 June 1876 and was succeeded by George W. Ward, who dedicated the chapel upon its completion on 22 February 1879. After the US Army left, the building continued functioning as a schoolhouse and, at one point, a private home. The Fort Concho Museum acquired the schoolhouse in 1946 and restored it. Since 1976, it has housed a living history event to teach local elementary schoolers about life in 1880s Texas.

Overview ≈åmi was located on the Japan Sea coast, about four hundred kilometres north-west of Tokyo. The town also had two additional neighborhoods, Oyashirazu and Ichiburi, located six kilometres and thirteen kilometres respectively further down the coast from the main part of ≈åmi. On March 19, 2005, ≈åmi, along with the town of N≈ç (also from Nishikubiki District), was merged into the expanded city of Itoigawa. Demographics The town was a classic case of rural decline now often found in modern Japan. Over a period of 30 years, the population had decreased from around 17,000 to 9,797 as of 2003, with a population density of 75.87 persons per km¬≤. The total area was 129.13 km¬≤. After graduating from high school, many young people are forced to move to major population centres for university or in search of work. This was reflected in the population, with the majority of residents aged over 35. Concurrently the number of students attending ≈åmi Junior High School fell from 568 to below 300 over a period of 20 years. ≈åmi had many well-funded facilities, including regular local bus and train services (but only a few long-distance services), an indoor heated pool, gymnasium, baseball field, several small local parks, mountain camping sites, plus a new natural history museum, library, and performance hall seating 500 people. However, there were only a few small local shops, supermarkets and restaurants, and no entertainment facilities. With the declining population many such facilities (such as the movie theatre and baseball stadium) were closed and demolished in recent years. Travel information ≈åmi ‚Äî The temple and park above ≈åmi Kindergarten are quite pretty with a good view of the town. There is also a natural history museum at Kirara ≈åmi Hall near the train station. Apart from these the only other real attractions are the nearby mountains and beach where one can go fossicking for jade washed down from Hisui Gorge in the nearby mountains. Oyashirazu ‚Äî An old village with many older houses. It is a popular beach during summer with some beer stalls, plus a \\"Sunset Station\\" (Pier Park) and shops. Ichiburi ‚Äî This is a quaint little fishing village with still many signs of old Japan. Festivals ≈åmi no take no karakai is a traditional New Years event that has been carried out since the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867). The event is performed in competition between the Eastern area of the town and the Western side. It begins with \\"Omatsutori\\" on January 7, where the two sides try to compete over kazaritake (ornamental bamboo) and two bamboos (isamitake and awasetake) tell the fortune regarding any bumper crop. The isamitake and awasetake activities, where bamboo branches are hooked and pulled, are joined in by young and old alike while the audience cheers. Although it is said that there used to be a few similar examples of this kind of New Years event in Japan, this one in ≈åmi is the only remaining one.

Introduced in 1983 on a stretched version of the Chrysler K platform, the E-Class was a less expensive, less equipped version of the similar 1983 New Yorker. History The Chrysler E-Class was targeted at those who wanted Chrysler luxury at a more affordable price than the flagship New Yorker. Due to this reason, the E-Class is the de facto replacement for the 1981 Newport, which had been Chrysler's cheaper, more basic version of the New Yorker. The E-Class was originally to be called the \\"Grand LeBaron\\",Encyclopedia of American Cars \\"Chrysler\\" p.255: \\"Chrysler Vehicles.\\" however Chrysler decided to name it \\"E-Class\\" in reference to the new E-platform. The E-Class came with a number of features and options including a cassette player, split 50/50 front bench with middle seat mounted console, woodgrain interior trim, two-tone exterior paint, power window & door locks, and air conditioning. Engines were the 2.2 L naturally aspirated I4 and the Mitsubishi 2.6 L I4. 1984 saw the debut of fuel injection on the 2.2 L engine and an optional Garrett AiResearch T-03 turbocharger. Larger, wraparound tail lights were also added for 1984. The E-Class however, was not a sales success. Sales of the more expensive New Yorker were nearly double the E-Class's sales for 1984.Encyclopedia of American Cars \\"Chrysler\\" p.279: \\"Chrysler Production Figures.\\" Its slow sales caused it to be dropped from Chrysler's lineup after only two years on the market.

It was introduced in 1982, as a 1983 model, based on the Chrysler E platform and was discontinued after the 1988 model year. It was Chrysler's answer to the GM A-body, whereas the M-body Dodge Diplomat would compete with full-size cars. It replaced the 400. (Dodge 600 coupes and convertibles were, essentially, rebadged 400s.) Like the preceding 400, it was positioned between the Aries and Diplomat. Debut The 600 was intended to be Dodge's answer to the European sedans of the day. Its numerical name and rear-end styling was designed to evoke thoughts of Mercedes-Benz models, however it fell more in line with North American contemporaries such as the Chevrolet Celebrity, Pontiac 6000 and the Ford Fairmont (the 600 actually resembled the Dodge Mirada more than any European car). It debuted as a four-door sedan, available in two trims: Base and ES (\\"Euro Sport\\"). Power was provided by Chrysler's 2.2 L 4-cylinder engine, with the Mitsubishi-built 2.6 L 4-cylinder available as an option.

This was in large part due to the addition of the former 400's coupe and convertible body styles to the 600's range (which continued to stay on the K platform). Like most midrange- to-upscale K-car derivatives, digital dashboards and the Electronic Voice Alert were options. ES Turbo Mid-way into 1984 Dodge introduced a sporty new \\"ES Turbo\\" package for convertibles. It featured Chrysler's new 2.2 L Turbocharged engine (which also became an option on sedans and coupes) and a special sport-tuned \\"ES\\" suspension. The interior came with standard leather seats, digital dashboard, and four-spoke steering wheel (redesigned in 1985). Visual exterior cues differentiate ES models from base convertibles by way of blacked-out trim (replacing much of the chrome), 15-inch \\"pizza\\" style aluminum wheels, \\"ES\\" decklid badges, Turbo fender badges, and functioning dual hood vents. Sales of the ES Turbo were initially slow, with only 1786 copies being sold for the 1984 model year. Output increased to 5621 for 1985, then eased to 4759 for 1986, after which the model was discontinued along with all 600 convertibles. Base price for the 1986 ES Turbo convertible was $14,856. Midlife changes Several changes were made to the 600 in 1985. The 600 sedan was moved to a longer wheelbase and the former base and ES trims were dropped, replaced by a new SE trim. This was due in part to the new Lancer, which would have competed directly with the 600 (the 5-speed manual transmission was no longer offered as well, in an attempt to keep competition between the Lancer and 600 to a minimum). The coupe and convertible remained relatively unchanged except for minor trim and interior changes. The only significant advancement was the replacement of the 2.2 L engine's two-barrel Holley electronic feedback carburetor by an electronic throttle-body fuel injection system. The sedan's base trim returned in 1986, while all 600s were given new, restyled front and rear fascias (the front in particular adopted the now familiar \\"crosshair\\" grille, dropping the Mirada-inspired horizontal slats). The 2.6 L engine was replaced by a modified 2.5 L version of the Chrysler 2.2 L. End of production The phase out of the 600 started in 1987 with the coupe and convertible versions being discontinued in that year. Production of the sedan ended in 1988. The 600 was replaced by the 1988 Dodge Dynasty (badged as a Chrysler in Canada, whereas the Canadian successor is the Dodge Spirit). There were negotiations to build the car in China after production ended. Hongqi imported a couple of 600s and applied a new rear end and Hongqi badging, intending to sell them as the Hongqi CA750F in China. However, Volkswagen's long-term outlook convinced the Chinese otherwise and Hongqi chose to build the Audi 100 instead, albeit fitted with a locally built version of Chrysler's 2.2-liter inline-four.

Shown here will be fastened to this recessed, non-metallic box, then a cover plate is installed. This \\"double gang\\" (two unit) installation uses non- metallic-sheathed cable and twist-on wire connectors. In electrical wiring, a light switch is a switch most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets. Portable lamps such as table lamps may have a light switch mounted on the socket, base, or in-line with the cord. Manually operated on/off switches may be substituted by dimmer switches that allow controlling the brightness of lamps as well as turning them on or off, time-controlled switches, occupancy-sensing switches, and remotely controlled switches and dimmers. Light switches are also found in flashlights, vehicles, and other devices. Wall-mounted switches Switches for lighting may be in hand-held devices, moving vehicles, and buildings. Residential and commercial buildings usually have wall-mounted light switches to control lighting within a room. Mounting height, visibility, and other design factors vary from country to country. The switch mounting boxes, or enclosures are often recessed within a finished wall. Surface mounting of enclosures is also fairly common though is seen more in commercial industrial and outbuilding settings than in residential structures. These light switch boxes (a pattress box) are designed to house and mount the switch(s), protect the wiring and contain any heat or fire. Each kind uses some form of a plastic, ceramic, or metal cover to prevent accidental contact with live terminals of the switch. Wall plates are available in different styles and colours to blend in with the style of a room, also available in weatherproof varieties for outdoors. These covers are usually quite easy to mount. History, culture, and style Two light switches in one box. The switch on the right is a dimmer switch. The switch box is covered by a decorative plate. The first light switch employing \\"quick-break technology\\" was invented by John Henry Holmes in 1884 in the Shieldfield district of Newcastle upon Tyne.Electric Light Years 1878-1899 - England's North East The \\"quick-break\\" switch overcame the problem of a switch's contacts developing electric arcing whenever the circuit was opened or closed. Arcing would cause pitting on one contact and the build-up of residue on the other, and the switch's useful life would be diminished. Holmes' invention ensured that the contacts would separate or come together very quickly, however much or little pressure was exerted by the user on the switch actuator. The action of this \\"quick break\\" mechanism meant that there was insufficient time for an arc to form, and the switch would thus have a long working life. This \\"quick break\\" technology is still in use in almost every ordinary light switch in the world today, numbering in the billions, as well as in many other forms of electric switch. The toggle light switch was invented in 1916 by William J. Newton. As a component of an electrical wiring or home wiring system, the installation of light switches is regulated by some authority concerned with safety and standards. In different countries the standard dimensions of the wall mounting hardware (boxes, plates, etc.) may differ. Since the face-plates used must cover this hardware, these standards determine the minimum sizes of all wall mounted equipment. Hence, the shape and size of the boxes and face-plates, as well as what is integrated, varies from country to country. The dimensions, mechanical designs, and even the general appearance of light switches have changed slowly over time. Switches typically remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when a portion of a house is rewired. It is not unusual to see century-old light switches still in functional use. Manufacturers introduce various new forms and styles, but for the most part decoration and fashion concerns are limited to the face-plates or wall-plates. Even the \\"modern\\" dimmer switch with knob is at least forty years old, and in even the newest construction the familiar toggle and rocker switch formats predominate. =Orientation= The direction which represents \\"on\\" also varies by country. In the US, Canada, European countries, Russia, etc., it is usual for the \\"on\\" position of a toggle switch to be \\"up\\", whereas in many other countries such as the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand (Commonwealth countries) it is \\"down\\". (In multiway switching, the correspondence between a single switch's state and whether lights are on or off depends on the state of the other switch[es] in the circuit.) Design The switches may be single or multiple, designed for indoor or outdoor use. Optional extras may include dimmer-controls, environmental protection, weather and security protection. In residential and light commercial lighting systems, the light switch directly controls the circuit feeding the lamps. In larger lighting systems, for example warehouses or outdoor lighting systems, the required current may be too high for a manual switch. In these systems light switches control lighting contactors, a relay that allows the manual light switch to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit. In the UK, putting 13 amp BS 1363 sockets on a lighting circuit is discouraged (although not outright prohibited), but 2 amp or 5 amp BS 546 outlets are often put on lighting circuits to allow control of free-standing lamps from the room's light switches. In North American site-built and mobile homes, often living rooms and bedrooms have a switched receptacle for a floor or table lamp. =Internal operation= The contacts of a switch are under their greatest stress while opening or closing. As the switch is closed, the resistance between the contacts changes from almost infinite to almost zero. At infinite resistance, no current flows and no power is dissipated. At zero resistance, there is no voltage drop and no power is dissipated. However, while the contacts change state, there is a brief instant of partial contact when resistance is neither zero nor infinite, and electrical power is converted into heat. If the heating is excessive, the contacts may be damaged, or may even weld themselves closed. A switch should be designed to make its transition as swiftly as possible. This is achieved by the initial operation of the switch lever mechanism storing potential energy, usually as mechanical stress in a spring. When sufficient mechanical energy is stored, the mechanism in the switch \\"breaks over\\", and quickly drives the contacts through the transition from open to closed, or closed to open, without further action by the switch operator. This quick-break action of the switch is essential to a long life for the switch contacts, as described in Holmes' 1884 patent. While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts. Switches are commonly rated by the current they are designed to break, under specified voltage and power factor conditions, as this is the most stringent limitation. The arc that results when the switch opens erodes the switch contacts. Therefore, any switch has a finite life, often rated at a given number of cycles of disconnection at a specified current. Operation outside of its specified operating capacity will drastically shorten the life of the switch. To combat contact corrosion, a switch is usually designed to have a \\"wipe\\" action so that the contacts are cleaned. Large switches may be designed with a supplemental replaceable contact that closes and opens before the main contact, protecting the main current-carrying contacts from wear due to arcing. The contact area of the switch is constructed of materials that resist corrosion and arcing. Many higher current switch designs rely on the separation arc to assist in dispersing contact corrosion. A switch designed for high-current high-voltage use may become unreliable if operated at very low currents and low voltages, because a non-conductive oxide layer builds up without an arc to disperse it. Two kinds of sparks may occur during switch operation. On closure, a few sparks, like those from a flint-and-steel, may appear as a tiny bit of metal is heated by friction to incandescence, melted, and thrown off. On opening, a bluish arc may occur, with a detectable \\"electrical\\" (ozone) odor. Subsequently, the contacts may be seen to be darkened and pitted. Damaged contacts have higher resistance, rendering them more vulnerable to further damage and causing a cycle in which the contacts soon may fail completely. To make a switch safe, durable, and reliable, it must be designed so that the contacts are held firmly together under positive force when the switch is closed. It should be designed so that, regardless of how the operator manipulates the actuator, the contacts always close or open quickly. In the construction of many small switches, the spring that stores the mechanical energy necessary for the snap action of the switch mechanism is made of a beryllium copper alloy that is hardened to form a spring as part of the fabrication of the contact. The same part often also forms the body of the contact itself, and is thus the current path. Abusing the switch mechanism to hold the contacts in a transition state, or severely overloading the switch, will heat and thus anneal the spring, reducing or eliminating the \\"snap action\\" of the switch, leading to slower transitions, more energy dissipated in the switch, and progressive failure. Variations on design =Push button= Vintage push-button light switches The push-button light switch has two buttons: one that closes the contacts and one that opens the contacts. Pushing the raised button opens or closes the contacts and pops out the previously depressed button so the process can be reversed. In the U.S., the buttons were commonly black; the \\"on\\" button typically had a white mother-of- pearl (real or simulated) inlay to indicate its function. By convention, the switch was customarily installed with the \\"on\\" button on top. Push-button switch reproductions are available on the market today for vintage or authentic styling. =Toggle= A toggle light switch Internal components of a toggle switch The toggle mechanism provides \\"snap-action\\" through the use of an \\"over-center\\" geometry. The design was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg. The switch actuator does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of springs and levers. Turning the actuator does not initially cause any motion of the contacts, which in fact continue to be positively held open by the force of the spring. Turning the actuator gradually stretches the spring. When the mechanism passes over the center point, the spring energy is released and the spring, rather than the actuator, drives the contacts rapidly and forcibly to the closed position with an audible \\"snapping\\" sound. This mechanism is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud snap or click. in the United States, the toggle switch mechanism was almost entirely supplanted by \\"quiet switch\\" mechanisms. \\"Quiet switch\\" mechanisms still possess a form of snap action, but it is very weak as compared to its predecessor. They are therefore equipped with larger, high-quality contacts that are capable of switching domestic loads without damage, despite the less-positive action. =Illuminated switch= A UK illuminated rocker switch in the off position Illuminated switches incorporate a small neon lamp or LED, allowing the user easily to locate the switch in the dark. Household illuminated switches were introduced in the mid-1950s. Single-pole illuminated switches derive the power to energize their in-built illuminating source (usually, a \\"neon\\" lamp) from the current passing through the lamp(s) which they control. Such switches work satisfactorily with incandescent lamps, halogen lighting, and non-electronic fluorescent fixtures, because the small current required for the switch's illuminating source is too small to produce any visible light from such devices controlled by the illuminated switch. However, if they control only compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and/or LED lamps, the small amount of current required to energize the lighting source within switch also slowly charges the internal input capacitor in the electronic ballast of the CFL or LED until the voltage across it rises to the point where it produces a brief discharge through the CFL. This cycle may repeat indefinitely, resulting in repetitive brief flashing of the lamp(s) (and the light inside the switch) while the illuminated switch is in the \\"off\\" position. =Rocker= A Leviton Decora rocker switch A European style rocker switch An alternative design to the toggle switch is the rocker switch. Large switches of this design are commonly known as \\"decorator style\\" in the United States. Switches of this design sit almost flush with the wall plate, and are activated by \\"rocking\\" a flat, broad lever, rather than pushing a short protruding actuator up or down. In Europe, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and India this type is near-universal, and toggle style switches would be considered old-fashioned. =Australian rocker switches= 3 Australian light switches and a \\"neon\\" indicator‚Äîin a 4-gang wall-plate. The lower switch is in the \\"on\\" or \\"down\\" position. Two Australian rocker switches (disassembled), together with a cutaway view, and a view of the switch connections An Australian architrave-mounted 2-gang switch plate and switches. In Australia and New Zealand, a small rocker switch is almost universally used, in the form of a switch mechanism, which is mounted from behind into a wall-plate‚Äîattaching via mounting lugs, as shown in the photo on the left. A slightly larger \\"cover plate\\", supplied with the wall-plate, or additional to it, then clips over the assembly, as an additional insulating barrier covering the deep set wall-plate mounting screws - which are \\"deep set\\" to prevent inadvertent human contact. The \\"cover plate\\" can be removed without the use of tools, such as when wall painting is required. While larger \\"decorator\\" style switches are readily available in Australia, the advantage of the smaller mechanisms is that wall-plates are available to mount from one to six individual switch mechanisms, or other correspondingly sized \\"mechanisms\\" - such as dimmers and indicator lights - in the same space as one (or two) switches of larger design could be mounted. Since the mechanisms are small, they can also be mounted into \\"architrave\\" plates, for mounting in positions where it is not possible to mount a \\"standard\\" sized wall-plate. An example is shown in the picture below on the right. All of the switch mechanisms have no exposed metal parts requiring grounding (earthing). While switches, wall-plates, and cover plates from different manufacturers tend not to be interchangeable, switch mechanisms of this type have been available in Australia since 1951.Clipsal History Timeline The keystone module system for extra-low voltage electrical jacks (patented in 1975) is somewhat similar in appearance to these modules, but the design of the keystone mountings are different, and keystone modules can be removed without a tool. (A similar system, but with bigger switches, is used in Italy.) As shown in the disassembly photo, the switch actuator pivots in two holes in the sides of the plastic switch body. An actuator bar slides in two grooves inside the actuator, pressed down by a compression spring into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the compression spring, the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts. When the actuator is moved, mechanical energy is stored in the compression spring until the actuator passes its mid-position. At that time, the common contact bar is forced in the opposite direction by the compression spring, acting via the actuator bar, thus breaking the connection with the existing contact and making connection with the other contact. The common contact bar is made of copper, with an inlay of harder contact metal on the underside. While it is free to move the required distance lengthwise, it is constrained from moving sideways by the construction of the molded plastic body. The screw terminals are hollow and allow up to at least three 1 mm (CSA) wires, twisted together, to be inserted to a depth of up to and secured with a set screw. The contact terminal set screws are installed at a slight angle to allow easier screwdriver access after the switch mechanism has been installed into a wall-plate - before fixing the wall-plate to the wall. Also shown is a \\"loop\\" connection terminal. This terminal plays no part in the action of the switch but, because there is available space, it is provided as an insulated terminal for joining other wires, if required (such as the neutral wires). Each Australian rocker switch mechanism is actually a single-pole, double- throw (SPDT) Switch, also known as a \\"two-way switch\\", and has three terminals. A switch of basically the same design is also used on Australian power outlet wall-plates. It is now extremely rare to find any other type of switch in Australian homes, although the Australian Wiring Standard AS 3112 does not forbid other types. While many variations of Australian designs and cover plates are available, some designers and renovators may import UK- and European-designed switches when they desire a particular finish. However, while standard Australian wall mounting plates have the same dimensions as those used in North America, they have different dimensions from those used in the UK or Europe. Switches (and other mechanisms) of this Australian design series are currently available in the UK (and other countries), together with wall-plates appropriate to the mounting standards of the countries concerned. For a short time, Australian rocker switches were exported to the United States in the 1960s. Although the switches had adequate ratings for usage on 120 V circuits and had advantages of compactness and distinctive appearance, they failed to establish themselves in the American market. =Tamper resistant= Tamper resistant switch Where lighting circuits must not be accidentally switched off, for example, corridor and restroom lighting controls in public buildings such as schools, a tamper-resistant switch may be installed. These require a key to operate and so discourage casual or accidental operation of the switch. =Voltage class= In North American commercial and industrial lighting installations, lighting installed on 480Y/277 V 3-phase circuits uses voltages higher than the rating of common 120 V switches. =Mercury switch= Mercury light switch from General Electric , 120 V 15 A Around the middle of the 20th century, \\"quiet\\" switches were introduced that used mercury to make the connection, avoiding the loud snap made by the spring-loaded toggle switches that were then the norm. One form of mercury light switch uses a sealed glass vial that is tipped by the toggle lever, causing a drop of liquid metallic mercury to roll from one end to the other, bridging a pair of contacts to complete the circuit. Another style of mercury light switch uses a metal wheel with an insulator separating the two halves that has a hole which allows the mercury to connect either side of the wheel in only one position. Some of these switches were also equipped with a neon lamp connected across the contacts, and thus in series with the electrical load. This caused the indicator to glow faintly when the switch was off, as an aid to finding the switch in a dark room. By the 1970s, other quiet switch designs that did not require mercury (and were thus simpler and cheaper to produce) came into widespread use, gradually replacing both conventional \\"snap\\" toggle switches and mercury-based quiet switches. =Pull-chain or pull-cord= A light switch combined with a light socket is sometimes installed in basement or utility areas of homes. The switch is operated by a pull chain or cord. It is also possible to have the cord-operated switch separate from the light socket, which is particularly common in British bathrooms. Until 2001, UK wiring regulations required that all bathroom switches were operated by pull cords. =Dimmer switch= A dimmer switch, properly called a dimmer control, contains a solid-state circuit to allow changing the brightness by reducing the average voltage applied to the lamp. =Electronic switches= RF-based remote control In principle, it is easy to design silent switches in which the mechanical contacts do not directly control the current, but simply signal a solid-state device such as a thyristor to complete the circuit. Many variations on this theme have been created and marketed. \\"Touch-plate\\" devices can be operated by touching or merely waving a hand near the switch. Touch switches have no moving parts and electronically switch the light circuit. these remain specialty items. Electronic switches provide flexibility in terms of different interfaces for their operations, such as touch plates, soft-touch controls, pressure or light sensor based control, interactive touch-screens (which are widely used in aircraft for lighting control), and others. Public buildings such as hospitals frequently save energy by using motion detector switches, also known as occupancy sensors. The occupancy sensors can also be used in residential applications such as in bathrooms, garages, and hallways. A wireless light switch provides remote control of lighting using a hand-held transmitter. While the controlling device may be a unit dedicated to this purpose, increasingly such switches may be controlled by the technology (such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) now found in smartphones. Wired remote control of lighting switches is also possible using, for example, X10 signaling over the power wires. Multiway switching Two or more light switches can be interconnected to allow control of lighting from, for example, two ends of a long hallway or landings at the upper and lower landings of a flight of stairs. Multiway switching is done using special switches that have additional contacts. Materials Old tumbler switch made up of Bakelite Earlier switches were made of porcelain in the surface-mounted version and operated as a rotary switch with a rotary mechanism. Later, more durable Bakelite and Ebonite was used. Today they are made of modern plastics, like Polycarbonate or fire resistant ABS. Some switches may also be manufactured from other plastics like polyamide, polypropylene or pvc but mainly limited to wire mounted switches (like night lamp switches) mainly due to reduced weight, and most such switches are not used in high power devices (mainly table lamps, table fans, some radios) mainly up to 2 amperes. In some cases, especially in hospitals and other public facilities, exposed parts of light switches are made of antimicrobial materials such as copper, for infection control.

The brand is owned by MTV Networks International (part of the Viacom conglomerate). It shows only pop videos and locally produced live programming in Belgium and likewise with TMF Netherlands before its closure, the British TMF aired some of MTV's and VH1's programmes like Cribs, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, Hogan Knows Best and Run's House. The channel operated until 26 October 2009 in the UK and Ireland, 1 September 2011 in the Netherlands and 1 November 2015 in Belgium. The brand is owned by Viacom International Media Networks, the international arm of Viacom. TMF Nederland Logo of TMF Nederland. TMF Nederland was launched on 1 May 1995 as the only local pop station in the Netherlands. It was founded by Lex Harding and the Arcade company. The station gradually began to get better viewer figures than MTV, so in 2002, MTV bought shares in TMF. Since 1996 headquartered in Bussum, the channel was notable for its dance music mixes. In 2005, three new channels, plus a radio station began broadcasting in the Netherlands under the TMF brand: * TMF Dance - specialised in German, British, French, Belgian and Dutch trance and house music. Formerly known as \\"TMF Party\\". * TMF NL - specialised in local Dutch music. * TMF Pure - specialised in Soul, and R&B; music. * TMF Hit Radio - Launched on 27 December 2006 and later dropped the TMF branding which soon after became 'Hit Radio' On 1 September 2011, TMF Nederland ceased broadcasting in the Netherlands entirely, and on 31 December 2011 all digital channels ceased operations. TMF Flanders TMF Flanders (TMF Vlaanderen) was the first international extension of the TMF brand, broadcast to viewers in the Belgian region of Flanders. TMF Flanders first day on air was October 3, 1998. TMF Flanders was the first Flemish-specific channel that was dedicated to video clip broadcast. VJs at the beginning included Stijn Smets, Yasmine, Inge Moerenhout and Katja Retsin. In the early few years, the broadcasts of TMF Flanders were conducted from the same Dutch studio facility that operated TMF Netherlands. Until 2010 its broadcast were entirely in Dutch with local Flemish presenters. From the start, TMF Flanders is being distributed via cable-TV (analog and/or digital) and IPTV. Founded in 1998, its headquarters were in Mechelen but moved to Lint and later (after the re-alignment of VIMN Northern Europe) to Antwerp (local office) and Stockholm (channel operations). It is the sole TMF channel that is currently still in operation, but it has dropped all its presented programs in 2012. Since 2014 Comedy Central airs on its channel after 10pm. On November 1, 2015 TMF Vlaanderen ceased broadcasting. The channel was replaced by Comedy Central Vlaanderen, ending the TMF-era. In 2007, a second channel was launched and began broadcasting under the TMF brand: * TMF Live HD - specialised in live music. On 31 July 2010, TMF Live HD ceased operations. On 1 November 2015, TMF Flanders ceased broadcasting in Belgium entirely, making Comedy Central a 24 hours channel. TMF UK & Ireland Logo of TMF Australia and TMF UK & Ireland TMF launched on 30 October 2002 as a counter against EMAP's The Hits request music channel on Freeview. The channel was also available on Sky Digital and Virgin Media. The channel, alongside its music output, showed reruns of successful MTV and VH1 shows such as Pimp My Ride, Jackass and Cribs. There was also a Noggin strand in the morning for pre-school children. On Mondays, TMF used to broadcast The Official UK Top 40 narrated by Phil Clifton, a day after it was broadcast on BBC Radio 1. The show featured videos of the singles of the previous week and charts their position in terms of record sales. On 26 October 2009, TMF UK & Ireland was replaced with the UK version of VIVA.  TMF Australia  MTV Networks Australia launched a local version of TMF as a fully integrated, multi-platform 24-hour music channel in May 2007. TMF focused on the interactive playground and along with a selection of music video clips including programming and viewer-generated content including images, videos, text-based applications and graphics. Furthering the connectivity between the platforms, TMF was the first music channel in Australia to seamlessly connect all platforms as well as simulcast to mobile 24 a day via the Optus Zoo mobile portal launched in September 2007. However, in November 2010, TMF Australia was replaced with an Australian version of MTV Hits. TMF Awards The channel organized an annual music award show, the TMF Awards, in the Netherlands and Belgium. In addition, there were the TMF Game Awards, an annual awards show for games. History In 1995 multimedia company Arcade and former DJ Lex Harding received an idea to set up a Dutch music channel. In contrast to countries like Germany (VIVA) and France (MCM), the Netherlands did not have a national music channel. Harding, at that time director of Radio 538, felt that the time was right. And so within two months by a handful of people, led by Lex, with might and worked on the launch of \\"The Music Factory\\". On May 1, 1995 at 16:00 it was so far, TMF started with a spectacular live shows which include all VJs (video jockeys) were asked for and the programming was announced. Only it is called in the very beginning still MC6. VJs VJs who were there from the beginning were: Erik de Zwart, Fabienne de Vries, Jeroen Post, Isabelle Brinkman, Michael Pilarczyk, Ruud de Wild, Sylvana Simons and Wessel van Diepen.

The term was first coined by Robert A. Heinlein's Methuselah's Children in 1958. In a fantasy context, it means that magic is hidden, whether in secret locations, such as Diagon Alley in Harry Potter, or by magical forces, such as the Mist in Percy Jackson, or a glamour placed on individuals. That is typically done to avoid some type of mass panic that would result in the destruction of the magical world by far more numerous normal people fearing the unknown. Masquerade societies may seek to hide this information from outsiders, or they may be disbelieved due to ignorance, conspiracies, or consensus reality. In horror-tinged works of fantasy, such as H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, the Buffyverse, or White Wolf Games' World of Darkness setting, the majority's ignorance of the true horrors of their world may seem like a blessing. The trope is used not only in fantasy but also in science fiction and superhero stories. A common device to keep hidden events from the masses in science fiction is the existence of aliens, such as in the Men in Black series. The secret identities of superheroes are also a type of masquerade, and the only superheroes that show their true identity are ones who can keep their family safe or have nothing to protect. The masquerade trope benefits writers by adding additional tension to the story and helps it seem more like something plausible. It also saves the author from having to \\"rewrite history\\" to explain the existence of magic.  Examples  * Masquerade society from Vampire: The Masquerade * Harry Potter series by J.K.

In organic chemistry, H√ºckel's rule estimates whether a planar ring molecule will have aromatic properties. The quantum mechanical basis for its formulation was first worked out by physical chemist Erich H√ºckel in 1931.  The succinct expression as the 4n + 2 rule has been attributed to W. v. E. Doering (1951), although several authors were using this form at around the same time. In keeping with the M√∂bius-H√ºckel concept, a cyclic ring molecule follows H√ºckel's rule when the number of its œÄ-electrons equals 4n + 2 where n is a non-negative integer, although clearcut examples are really only established for values of n = 0 up to about n = 6. H√ºckel's rule was originally based on calculations using the H√ºckel method, although it can also be justified by considering a particle in a ring system, by the LCAO method and by the Pariser‚ÄìParr‚ÄìPople method. Aromatic compounds are more stable than theoretically predicted using hydrogenation data of simple alkenes; the additional stability is due to the delocalized cloud of electrons, called resonance energy. Criteria for simple aromatics are: # the molecule must have 4n + 2 electrons in a conjugated system of p orbitals (usually on sp2-hybridized atoms, but sometimes sp-hybridized); # the molecule must be (close to) planar (p orbitals must be roughly parallel and able to interact, implicit in the requirement for conjugation); # the molecule must be cyclic (as opposed to linear); # the molecule must have a continuous ring of p atomic orbitals (there cannot be any sp3 atoms in the ring, nor do exocyclic p orbitals count). Monocyclic hydrocarbons The rule can be used to understand the stability of completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons (known as annulenes) as well as their cations and anions. The best-known example is benzene (C6H6) with a conjugated system of six œÄ electrons, which equals 4n + 2 for n = 1\\\\. The molecule undergoes substitution reactions which preserve the six œÄ electron system rather than addition reactions which would destroy it. The stability of this œÄ electron system is referred to as aromaticity. Still, in most cases, catalysts are necessary for substitution reactions to occur. The cyclopentadienyl anion () with six œÄ electrons is planar and readily generated from the unusually acidic cyclopentadiene (pKa 16), while the corresponding cation with four œÄ electrons is destabilized, being harder to generate than a typical acyclic pentadienyl cations and is thought to be antiaromatic. Similarly, the tropylium cation (), also with six œÄ electrons, is so stable compared to a typical carbocation that its salts can be crystallized from ethanol. On the other hand, in contrast to cyclopentadiene, cycloheptatriene is not particularly acidic (pKa 37) and the anion is considered nonaromatic. The cyclopropenyl cation () and the triboracyclopropenyl dianion () are considered examples of a two œÄ electron system, which are stabilized relative to the open system, despite the angle strain imposed by the 60¬∞ bond angles. Planar ring molecules with 4n œÄ electrons do not obey H√ºckel's rule, and theory predicts that they are less stable and have triplet ground states with two unpaired electrons. In practice such molecules distort from planar regular polygons. Cyclobutadiene (C4H4) with four œÄ electrons is stable only at temperatures below 35 K and is rectangular rather than square. Cyclooctatetraene (C8H8) with eight œÄ electrons has a nonplanar \\"tub\\" structure. However the dianion (cyclooctatetraenide anion), with ten œÄ electrons obeys the 4n + 2 rule for n = 2 and is planar, while the 1,4-dimethyl derivative of the dication, with six œÄ electrons, is also believed to be planar and aromatic. Cyclononatetraenide anion () is largest all-cis monocyclic annulene/annulenyl system that is planar and aromatic. These bond angles (140¬∞) differ significantly from the ideal angles of 120¬∞. Larger rings possess trans bonds to avoid the increased angle strain. However, 10 to 14-membered systems all experience considerable transannular strain. Thus, these systems are either nonaromatic or experience modest aromaticity. This changes when we get to [18]annulene, with (4√ó4) + 2 = 18 œÄ electrons, which is large enough to accommodate 6 interior hydrogens in a planar configuration (3 cis double bonds and 6 trans double bonds). Thermodynamic stabilization, NMR chemical shifts, and nearly equal bond lengths all point to considerable aromaticity for [18]annulene. Refinement H√ºckel's rule is not valid for many compounds containing more than one ring. For example, pyrene and trans-bicalicene contain 16 conjugated electrons (8 bonds), and coronene contains 24 conjugated electrons (12 bonds). Both of these polycyclic molecules are aromatic, even though they fail the 4n + 2 rule. Indeed, H√ºckel's rule can only be theoretically justified for monocyclic systems. Three-dimensional rule In 2000, Andreas Hirsch and coworkers in Erlangen, Germany, formulated a rule to determine when a fullerene would be aromatic. They found that if there were 2(n + 1)2 œÄ-electrons, then the fullerene would display aromatic properties. This follows from the fact that an aromatic fullerene must have full icosahedral (or other appropriate) symmetry, so the molecular orbitals must be entirely filled. This is possible only if there are exactly 2(n + 1)2 electrons, where n is a nonnegative integer. In particular, for example, buckminsterfullerene, with 60 œÄ-electrons, is non-aromatic, since 60 √∑ 2 = 30, which is not a perfect square.. In 2011, Jordi Poater and Miquel Sol√† expanded the rule to determine when a fullerene species would be aromatic. They found that if there were 2n2 + 2n + 1 œÄ-electrons, then the fullerene would display aromatic properties. This follows from the fact that a spherical species having a same-spin half- filled last energy level with the whole inner levels being fully filled is also aromatic..

Timotheus (; died 354 BC) was a Greek statesman and general who sought to revive Athenian imperial ambitions by making Athens dominant in a Second Athenian League. He was the son of the Athenian general, Conon. Isocrates considered that Timotheus was superior to the other commanders of his time and showed all the requisites and abilities of a good general.Isocrates. Antidosis, Section 117. Strategos From 378 BC to 356 BC, Timotheus frequently held command as \\"strategos\\" in the wars between Athens (in alliance with Thebes), and Sparta. At this time, Athens' ambition was to revive the Delian League and to regain command of the sea. In 375 BC, during the Boeotian War, Timotheus was sent with a fleet to sail round Peloponnesus by way of a demonstration of Athens' power against Sparta. He persuaded Cephallenia to side with Athens and secured the friendship of the Acarnanians and Molossians. In 373 BC Timotheus was appointed to the command of a fleet for the relief of Corcyra, then beleaguered by the Spartans. But his ships were not fully manned, and to increase their manpower he cruised in the Aegean. The delay upset the Athenians, who brought him to trial; but, thanks to the intervention of his allies - Jason, tyrant of Pherae, and Alcetas I of Epirus, King of the Molossians, both of whom went to Athens to plead his cause - he was acquitted. In way of support, Amyntas, King of Macedon, sent timber to Timeotheus' house in the Piraeus. Upon his acquittal, he went to sea with his fleet and captured Corcyra and then defeated the Spartans at sea off Alyzia (Acarnania). However, with little money to his name ‚Äì for he had used his own funds to build up the Athenian fleet ‚Äì he left Athens and took service with the king of Persia as a mercenary. Asia Minor Having returned to Athens, in 366 BC he was sent to support Ariobarzanes, satrap of Phrygia. But, finding that the satrap was in open rebellion against Persia (Revolt of the Satraps), Timotheus, in line with his instructions, abstained from helping him and rather used his army against Samos, then occupied by a Persian garrison, and took it after a ten months' siege (366 BC-365 BC). He then took Sestus, Crithote, Torone, Potidaea, Methone, Pydna and many other cities; but two attempts to capture Amphipolis failed. Court case An action was brought against him by Apollodorus, the son of the banker Pasion, for the return of money lent by his father. The speech for the plaintiff is still extant, and is attributed to Demosthenes (see also Pseudo-Demosthenes). It is interesting as it describes the manner in which Timotheus had exhausted the large fortune inherited from his father and the straits to which he was reduced by his sacrifices in the public cause. The Social War In 358 BC or 357 BC, an Athenian force, in response to a spirited appeal from Timotheus, crossed over to Euboea and expelled the Thebans in three days. In the course of the Social War Timotheus was dispatched with Iphicrates, Menestheus, son of Iphicrates, and Chares to put down the revolt. The hostile fleets sighted each other in the Hellespont; but a gale was blowing, and Iphicrates and Timotheus decided not to engage. Chares, disregarding the advice of his colleagues, lost many ships. Final years In his dispatches after the battle, Chares complained so bitterly about Iphicrates and Timotheus that the Athenians put them on their trial. The accusers were Chares and Aristophon. Iphicrates, who had fewer enemies than Timotheus, was acquitted; but Timotheus, who had always been disliked for his perceived arrogance, was condemned to pay a very heavy fine. Being unable to pay, he withdrew to Chalcis, where he died soon afterwards. The Athenians later showed their sorrow over the treatment of Timotheus by forgiving the greater part of the fine that had passed onto his son Conon to pay. Timotheus was buried in the Ceramicus and statues were erected to his memory in the Agora and the Acropolis. Reputation Timotheus inspired much jealousy among his rivals, his reputation somewhat tarnished by the record of his final years. Claudius Aelianus sums up much of the negative perception of Timotheus' generalship. Note that the Athenian general Timotheus was reckoned to be fortunate. People said fortune was responsible, and Timotheus had no part in it. They ridiculed him on the stage, and painters portrayed him asleep, with Tykhe (Fortune) hovering above his head and pulling the cities into her net. This commentary is balanced by the credible picture (presented by Isocrates) of a skilled and cautious general, magnanimous victor and low-key diplomat.

Education and career Otyrba studied history at the Institute of History and Archives in Moscow, receiving his first degree in 1984, as well as a second degree from the Institute of General History in 1990. He was appointed as a Professor in the Department of Modern History at Abkhazian State University in the same year, and through the early 1990s, served as a visiting scholar in a number of universities around the world, including Johns Hopkins University and Maryland University in the United States and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, often dealing in topics associated with the civil war in his homeland. These experiences saw Otyrba take an interest in foreign policy, and in 1996, he underwent a course in mediation and human rights monitoring in Austria. He became involved in trying to establish dialogue between the two sides, and in 1997, was appointed Deputy Foreign Minister of Abkhazia. In the same year, he became Director of the Civil Society Development Centre a non-government organization based in the city of Gagra, a position which he held for approximately a year. Otyrba continued to both work in academia and serve as Deputy Foreign Minister for several years, and when long-serving Foreign Minister Sergey Shamba resigned to run in the 2004 elections, Otyrba was a natural choice to fill in as a temporary replacement. However, the position only lasted for two months before he was replaced by Igor Akhba on 28 July 2004., and Otyrba has since returned to his prior roles. In his capacity of acting Foreign Minister, Otyrba headed the Abkhazian delegation to the meeting on repatriation of refugees held 20 July 2004 in Sochi. On 3 March 2007, Otyrba was appointed the first Commissioner for Human Rights of Abkhazia under the President of Abkhazia by Sergei Bagapsh. Following the adoption of a law constituting a new, independent, Human Rights Commissioner, the old office under the President was abolished and Otyrba was formally dismissed by Raul Khajimba on 4 May 2016.

Recolonization was launched in 1868, after the Indian raids were stopped and Fran√ßois Pioche bought the town in 1869. By the early 1870s, Pioche had grown larger, to become one of the most important silver- mining towns in Nevada. Because of the town's remoteness which had earlier allowed the Indian raids to occur, Pioche had a reputation for being one of the roughest towns in the Old West. Due mostly to confusion over the exact location of mining claims, mine owners finally resorted to hiring guards. In 1872, Tom and Ed Newland hired gunmen to takeover the very profitable mine owned by William H. Raymond and John Ely. They in turn hired four more men who during a raid in the middle of the night killed one of the guards and drove off the remainder. One of the four hired gunmen, Michael Casey, killed miner Tom Gossen after refusing to pay interest on a $100 loan. Before he died the next day, Gossen left a $5,000 reward to the man who killed Casey. Jim Leavy swore Casey had not shot Gossen in self defense, and Casey challenged Leavy to get his gun. The two men met in front of Felsenthal's store. Leavy shot Casey and then beat him to death with his pistol. Leavy in turn was wounded by David Neagle, who shot Leavy through the cheeks, leaving him permanently disfigured. It was reported that nearly 60 percent of the homicides reported in Nevada during 1871‚Äì72 took place in and around Pioche. Local lore says 72 men were killed in gunfights before the first natural death occurred in the camp. This legend is immortalized by the creation of Boot Hill, now a landmark in the city. Main Street in Pioche Pioche Town Hall Climate Pioche has a cool semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk) bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfa/Dsa) due to its high altitude and exposure to rain-bearing winds. The high elevation means summers are much cooler than in Clark County, with temperatures of reached upon only one afternoon every five years, and reached only upon 23.1 afternoons. The hottest month recorded was July 2005, with a mean maximum of , a record hot day of on July 17, and nine days above the century mark from July 11 to 19. Although summers are mostly dry with mild nights, it is not unknown for ‚ÄúArizona rains‚Äù to penetrate into Lincoln County during July and August, as happened in August 1945 when of rain fell on a total of eleven ‚Äúwet‚Äù days, and during August 1955 when seventeen days saw at least of rain. The fall season sees warm days and cold nights: the freeze-free period usually extends from May 17 to October 10, although temperatures below are very rare even during winter with an average of 1.1 mornings falling this low; the coldest temperature in Pioche has been on January 12, 1963. The coldest month has been January 1949 with a mean maximum of , although in a normal winter only 10.3 afternoons will not top freezing. During the winter, days are cool to cold ‚Äì although even in January 7.1 afternoons top ‚Äì and nights are very cold, although snowfall is extremely erratic. During the very wet and cold spell of January and February 1993, of snow fell in Pioche; however in warm dry winters like 1999/2000 almost no snow may occur. Landmarks and attractions An aerial tramway carried buckets of ore from the mines to the Godbe Mill. Pioche is known for its \\"Million Dollar Courthouse,\\" built in 1872. The original cost of $88,000 far exceeded initial estimates and was financed, and refinanced with bonds totaling nearly $1 million. Pioche currently contains the county administrative offices and has one of the oldest grade schools in the state. Next door to the courthouse sits the old Mountain View Hotel, where President Herbert Hoover is said to have stayed in 1930. Built in 1895, the hotel served the lodging needs of dignitaries visiting Pioche on court business. Although the building no longer serves as a hotel, it is an example of turn-of-the-century western architecture. There is another hotel, the Overland, which is still operating, with 14 themed rooms on the second floor over the main saloon. An aerial tramway carried buckets of ore from the mines to the Godbe Mill. The tramway ran during the 1920s and 1930s and was used for the transportation of silver and nickel ore. The abandoned tramway used cables which still stretch over parts of the town, with some original ore buckets intact. During Labor Day in September, the population swells for events including fireworks, history-based theater and mining car filling contests called \\"mucking events.\\" In December, the town holds a public Christmas tree lighting.

History  The band was formed in 1997 by original members Gunnar √ñrn Tynes and √ñrvar √û√≥reyjarson Sm√°rason, who were joined by twin sisters Gy√∞a and Krist√≠n Anna Valt√Ωsd√≥ttir. According to Krist√≠n, the band's name was not intended to mean anything. Gy√∞a left the band to return to her studies after the release of Finally We Are No One. In early 2006, Krist√≠n also left the band, although it was not officially announced until 23 November of that year. With only Tynes and Sm√°rason remaining in the group, a large group of new musicians were brought on board: guitarist/vocalist/violinist √ìl√∂f Arnalds, trumpet/keyboard player Eir√≠kur Orri √ìlafsson, vocalist/cellist Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir, percussionist Samuli Kosminen, and multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Mr. Silla. The new collective of musicians recorded their fourth album during 2006; Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy was released on 24 September 2007. M√∫m toured the East Coast of the US with German musician Volker \\"Hauschka\\" Bertelmann In November 2007. They returned in Spring 2008 with the same set list. Both tours included songs from the album, Go, Go Smear the Poison Ivy. On 27 August 2008, they announced on their official website that \\"m√∫m is quietly but surely [working on] their new album. No release date has been etched in stone, but every day will bring it closer.\\" M√∫m also released several pictures of themselves during the recording process on their MySpace page. During a 22 May 2009 concert in Burgos, Spain, M√∫m played songs from their newest album Sing Along to Songs You Don't Know. The album, recorded in Finland, Estonia, and Iceland, was released as a download through Gogoyoko on 17 August 2009, and on CD on 24 August 2009. In December 2011, M√∫m released an EP called Gle√∞ileg J√≥l (Merry Christmas in Icelandic) with traditional Icelandic Christmas songs. There are two songs plus one extra track. On 1 June 2012, M√∫m released a compilation titled Early Birds, featuring 15 tracks recorded between 1998 and 2000. On 9 February 2013, a collaboration of theirs with Kylie Minogue called \\"Whistle\\" surfaced on SoundCloud. M√∫m released their sixth album Smilewound in September, 2013 on CD, vinyl and digital download. On 7 September, it was released on cassette for Cassette Store Day. In 2019, Morr Music celebrated the 20th anniversary of m√∫m's debut album, Yesterday Was Dramatic ‚Äì Today Is OK, by rereleasing it.

In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal and the loss of their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates. Canadian Arctic Expedition =Background= Vilhjalmur Stefansson, leader of the Canadian Arctic Expedition The Canadian Arctic Expedition was the brainchild of Vilhjalmur Stefansson, a US-based, Canadian-born anthropologist of Icelandic extraction who had spent most of the years between 1906 and 1912 studying Inuit life in the remote Arctic Canada. His fieldwork had resulted in the first detailed information on the life and culture of the Copper Inuit, the so-called \\"blond Eskimos\\". Stefansson had returned home with plans for another expedition to continue his Arctic studies, and obtained promises of financial backing totalling US$45,000 (around US$750,000 in 2010) from the National Geographic Society (NGS) in Washington and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. However, he wanted to extend his plans to include geographical exploration in the Beaufort Sea, then a blank space on the world's maps.Henighan, pp. 57‚Äì58 For these expanded aims he needed more money, and approached the Canadian government for assistance.Niven, pp. 12‚Äì14 The area known as the \\"High Arctic\\" was subject to claims of sovereignty not only from Canada, but also from Norway and the United States. The Canadian government was concerned that an American-financed expedition would give the United States a legal claim to any new land discovered in the Beaufort Sea, so when the Canadian prime minister Robert Borden met Stefansson in Ottawa in February 1913 he offered to assume financial responsibility for the entire expedition. Borden's government was hopeful that the expedition would strengthen Canada's claim to sovereignty over the Arctic islands. The American sponsors agreed to withdraw, subject to an NGS condition that the Society could reclaim its rights to the expedition if Stefansson failed to depart by June 1913. This created a narrow deadline and hurried preparations for the journey north, although Stefansson maintained in his 1921 account that \\"forethought appeared to have anticipated every eventuality\\".Stefansson, p. 27 =Objectives and strategy= The Canadian government's financial involvement represented a shift in the expedition's emphasis, towards geographical exploration rather than the original purpose of ethnological and scientific studies.P√°lsson, p. 130 In a letter to the Canadian Victoria Daily Times, Stefansson set out these separate aims. The main object was to explore the \\"area of a million or so square miles that is represented by white patches on our map, lying between Alaska and the North Pole\\". The expedition also aimed to be the most comprehensive scientific study of the Arctic ever attempted. While a Northern Party searched for new lands, a mainly land-based Southern Party under zoologist Rudolph Anderson would carry out surveys and anthropological studies in the islands off the northern Canadian coast.Bartlett, pp. 4‚Äì6 The Northern Party's ship, Karluk, would proceed north from the Canadian coast until it either found land or was stopped by ice. It would explore any land it encountered; otherwise it would follow the ice edge eastward and attempt to winter at either Banks Island or Prince Patrick Island. If the ship was trapped in the ice and forced to drift, the party would study the direction of Arctic currents and carry out oceanographic research. Meanwhile, Rudolph Anderson's party was expected to continue with the anthropological studies of the \\"blond Eskimo\\", to collect varieties of Arctic flora and fauna, to carry out geological research, and to seek open- water channels in the hope of establishing new trade routes. =Organisation and personnel= Captain Robert Bartlett, who commanded Karluk's last voyage Stefansson's plan was to take the expedition to the old whaling station at Herschel Island off the Canadian Arctic coast, where the final composition of the Northern and Southern Parties would be decided and where equipment and supplies would be divided among the different strands of the venture. The haste to meet the NGS deadline led to concerns among the expedition's members about the adequacy of the provision of food, clothing and equipment.Leslie, pp. 297‚Äì98 Stefansson, who was largely absent in the hectic weeks immediately before sailing and who revealed few of his plans to his team, dismissed such concerns as \\"impertinent and disloyal\\". There were disputes between Stefansson and the scientists over the chain of command; the Canadian Geological Survey, which had provided four scientists to the expedition, wanted these men to report to them rather than to Stefansson. Southern Party leader Rudolph Anderson threatened to resign over Stefansson's claim to the publication rights of all private expedition journals.Henighan, pp. 60‚Äì61P√°lsson, p. 132 The expedition's scientific staff, with Stefansson and Bartlett. Malloch, Beuchat, McKinlay, Mamen, Mackay and Murray remained with Karluk; the others formed the Southern Party. The scientific team, made up of some of the most distinguished men in their fields, included representatives from the United States, Denmark, Norway and France, as well as from Britain and its Empire.McKinlay, pp. 10‚Äì13 Only two, however, had previous polar experience: Alistair Forbes Mackay, the expedition's medical officer, had visited Antarctica with Sir Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod expedition in 1907‚Äì09, and had been one of the party of three to discover the location of the South Magnetic Pole.Riffenburgh, p. 244 Another Nimrod veteran, the 46-year-old James Murray, was Stefansson's oceanographer. Among the younger scientists were William Laird McKinlay (1889‚Äì1983), a 24-year-old science teacher from Glasgow who was recommended by the Scottish explorer William Speirs Bruce, and Bjarne Mamen (1893‚Äì1914), a 20-year-old skiing champion from Christiania, Norway, who was taken on as a forester, despite lacking scientific experience. Stefansson had wanted American whaling skipper Christian Theodore Pedersen to captain Karluk, the ship designated for the Northern Party. When Pedersen withdrew, the captaincy was offered to 36-year-old Newfoundland-born Robert Bartlett, an experienced polar navigator who had commanded Robert Peary's ship, , on the Peary's 1906 and 1909 polar expeditions.Fleming, pp. 354‚Äì61 Bartlett did not have time, however, to select Karluk's crew, which was hurriedly assembled from around the Royal Navy Dockyard at Esquimalt in British Columbia. McKinlay later wrote of the crew that \\"one was a confirmed drug addict ... another suffered from venereal disease; and in spite of orders that no liquor was to be carried, at least two smuggled supplies on board.\\" McKinlay worried that this crew might lack the qualities and character necessary in the arduous months ahead, concerns shared by Bartlett, whose first act on arrival in Esquimalt was to fire the first officer for incompetence. In his place he appointed the 22-year-old Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Anderson.Niven, pp. 20‚Äì21 =Ships= Karluk in her days as a whaling vessel Karluk had been chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000.Niven, pp. 8‚Äì9 Stefansson was advised by Pedersen that, of four ships that were available, Karluk was \\"the soundest and best adapted for our purpose\\",Stefansson, pp. x, 47 but Bartlett had deep reservations about her fitness for prolonged Arctic service. The ship, a 29-year-old brigantine, was in length with a beam of . She had been built for the Aleutian fishing industry (karluk is the Aleut word for \\"fish\\") and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with Australian ironwood. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings, (search ship \\"Karluk\\") she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice. She did not match the expectations of Bartlett, or of many of the more experienced crew. The ship spent most of April and May 1913 undergoing repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, to act as a supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate.Jenness, pp. 8‚Äì9 In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. \\"Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island\\", McKinlay wrote.McKinlay, pp. 18‚Äì19 =Towards Herschel Island= Dog sleds prepared for the expedition, Nome, 1913 Members of Karluks scientific staff taking depth soundings during the drift in the ice, August 1913 Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The immediate destination was Nome, on the coast of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs.Niven, pp. 14‚Äì15 While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.McKinlay, pp. 15‚Äì17 At Port Clarence, just north of Nome, 28 dogs were taken on board before Karluk sailed north on 27 July. The next day she crossed the Arctic Circle, and almost immediately encountered rough weather which resulted in flooded cabins and seasickness. However, McKinlay noted that \\"whatever defects she had, Karluk was proving herself a fine sea- boat.\\"McKinlay, pp. 20‚Äì21 On 31 July they reached Point Hope, where two Inuit hunters, known as \\"Jerry\\" and \\"Jimmy\\", joined the ship. On 1 August the permanent Arctic ice pack was seen; Bartlett made several attempts to breach the ice, but each time was forced back.Niven, p. 16 On 2 August, about from Point Barrow, Karluk thrust her way into the ice but was soon trapped, and drifted slowly eastward for three days before reaching open water off Cape Smythe. Meanwhile, Stefansson had left to travel over the ice to Point Barrow. He rejoined the ship at Cape Smythe on 6 August, bringing with him Jack Hadley, a veteran trapper who required passage east. Hadley, a long-time acquaintance of Stefansson's, was entered in the ship's books as carpenter.Bartlett, p. 20Stefansson, p. 36 At Cape Smythe two more Inuit hunters, Keraluk and Kataktovik, joined the expedition, together with Keraluk's family‚Äîwife Keruk and their two young daughters Helen and Mugpi.Niven, pp. 24‚Äì27 As the voyage proceeded, Bartlett became increasingly anxious about the extent of ice in the area, and noted that the brass stemplates on the ship's bow had already been damaged.Bartlett, p. 23 Over the next few days Karluk struggled to make headway, as Bartlett took the ship northwards away from the coast, following channels of open water. The only scientific tasks of substance that could be carried out during this period were Murray's dredging operations, through which he collected many species of Arctic sea life, and the regular depth soundings.McKinlay, pp. 27 On 13 August Bartlett calculated their position as east of Point Barrow, with a similar distance to travel to Herschel Island.Bartlett, p. 26 This proved to be the ship's farthest point east, as at that position she became firmly trapped in the ice and began to move slowly westward; by 10 September Karluk had retreated nearly back towards Point Barrow.Niven, p. 49 Shortly afterwards, Stefansson informed Bartlett that all hopes for further progress that year had ended, and that Karluk would have to winter in the ice.McKinlay, p. 28 In the ice =Drifting west= Stefansson (foreground) and his party on their departure from Karluk, 20 September 1913 On 19 September, with Karluk ice- bound and largely stationary, Stefansson announced that in view of the shortage of fresh meat and the likelihood of a long sojourn in the ice, he would lead a small hunting party that would search for caribou and other game in the area of the Colville River. He would take with him the two Inuit \\"Jimmy\\" and \\"Jerry\\", the expedition secretary Burt McConnell, the photographer George Wilkins, and the anthropologist Diamond Jenness.Jenness, p. 11 Stefansson expected to be gone for about ten days; Bartlett was instructed by letter that, if the ship should move from its present position, he should \\"send a party ashore, to erect one or more beacons giving information of the ship's whereabouts.\\"Bartlett, p. 37 The next day the six men departed. On 23 September, following a blizzard, the ice floe in which Karluk was trapped began to move, and soon the ship was travelling at between a day‚Äîbut to the west, steadily further from Herschel Island and from Stefansson's party who, it soon became clear, would not be able to find their way back to the ship.Niven, pp. 54‚Äì56P√°lsson, p. 134 In an unpublished journal and later correspondence, McKinlay suggested that Stefansson's departure amounted to abandoning the ship to its fate. The expedition's historian S.E. Jenness (son of Diamond Jenness) rejects this view, pointing out that Stefansson and the hunting party members had left valuable property aboard Karluk; a possible motive for the trip, Jenness surmises, was to train the younger staff.Jenness, pp. 15‚Äì17 The anthropologist G√≠sli P√°lsson, writing of the expedition, asserts that while the anger of Bartlett and the crew is understandable, there is no evidence that Stefansson deliberately abandoned the men. It is arguable, P√°lsson says, that Stefansson acted responsibly in attempting to secure a supply of fresh meat which would counter the possibility of scurvy, should Karluk be trapped in the ice for a long time.P√°lsson, p. 167 The historian Richard Diubaldo writes \\"The evidence suggests that this was a normal hunting trip\\" and \\"... there is strong evidence to suggest he [Stefansson] wished he had never left [the ship]\\".Diubaldo, p. 82 thumb350pxalt=Section of the Arctic Ocean showing the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, with parts of the Siberian, Alaskan and Canadian coasts. Locations of Herschel, Wrangel and Herald Islands are indicated. Distinctive lines show (a) Karluk's outward voyage eastward around the northern Alaskan coast; (b) Karluk's drift westwards towards Siberia; (c) Crew marches to Wrangel and Herald Islands; (d) Bartlett's rescue journey to Alaska.  The constant snow and thick mists made it difficult for Bartlett to calculate the Karluk's position accurately, although during a brief break in the weather on 30 September they glimpsed land which they took to be Cooper Island, in the vicinity of Point Barrow where they had been at the start of August.Bartlett, p. 48 On 3 October the anxiety of crew and staff increased when, with Point Barrow just distant, the drift turned northwards, away from the land.Bartlett, p. 49 There were fears among some that Karluk would repeat the experience of the Jeannette, an American vessel that 30 years previously had drifted in the Arctic ice for months before sinking, with the subsequent loss of most of her crew.Fleming, pp. 201‚Äì29 Bartlett became aware that Murray and McKay, the two veterans of Shackleton's Nimrod expedition, were openly contemptuous of their captain's leadership. They were making plans to leave the ship at an appropriate time, and head for land on their own.Niven, pp. 61‚Äì62 As the weather grew worse Bartlett ordered supplies and equipment to be transferred onto the ice, both to lighten the ship and as a precaution should it be necessary to abandon the vessel in a hurry.Niven, pp. 70‚Äì78McKinlay, p. 44 Food supplies were augmented by seal hunts‚Äîtwo or three seals a day was the average bag, according to McKinlay‚Äîand by a single polar bear that had wandered near the ship in mid- November.McKinlay, p. 46 On 15 November Karluk reached 73¬∞N, the most northerly point of its drift, and then began moving south-west, in the general direction of the Siberian coast.Bartlett, p. 69 By mid-December the estimated position was from Wrangel Island. Despite the bleak outlook‚ÄîBartlett was privately convinced that Karluk would not survive the winter‚ÄîNiven, pp. 88‚Äì89 a determined effort was made to celebrate Christmas, with decorations, presents, a programme of sports on the ice, and a banquet.Bartlett, pp. 74‚Äì78 By then they were just north of Herald Island, a rocky outpost east of Wrangel Island; on 29 December land was visible in the distance, though whether this was Herald Island or Wrangel Island was not clear.Niven, p. 105 The sighting of land briefly raised morale, but in the New Year the ice began breaking up and forming pressure ridges. Over the next few days, wrote McKinlay, \\"the twanging, drumming, ominous ice sounds got louder and nearer.\\"McKinlay, pp. 63‚Äì65 =Sinking= Early in the morning of 10 January 1914, McKinlay records, \\"a severe shudder shook the whole ship\\" as the ice attacked the hull. Bartlett, still hoping to save his ship, gave orders to lighten her by removing all accumulated snow from the decks. He also ordered all hands to have warm clothing ready. At 6.45 in the evening a loud bang indicated that the hull had been punctured; Bartlett went immediately to the engine room and observed water pouring in through a gash long. There was no possibility that the pumps could deal with the inflow, and the captain gave the order to abandon ship.Niven, pp. 117‚Äì118 Weather conditions, says McKinlay, could hardly have been worse, but the crew and staff worked throughout the night, in pitch darkness and driving snow, to add to the quantities of rations and equipment already stored on the ice. Bartlett remained on board until the last moments, playing loud music on the ship's Victrola. At 3:15 p.m. on 11 January, Bartlett put on Chopin's Funeral March as a final salute to the ship, and stepped off. Karluk sank within minutes, her yardarms snapping off as she disappeared through the narrow hole in the ice.Bartlett, pp. 90‚Äì91 McKinlay took stock of the stranded party: 22 men, one woman, two children, 16 dogs and a cat. =Shipwreck Camp= Shipwreck camp, established on the ice after Karluks sinking Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers.See rough plan drawn by McKinlay. Bartlett, p. 98 In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\"McKinlay, pp. 68‚Äì70 Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Niven, p. 129 Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible.Niven, p. 131 Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island.Niven, pp. 133‚Äì38 A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, from their intended destination. This was the last sighting of Anderson's party; their ultimate fate was not established until ten years later, when their remains were found on Herald Island.McKinlay, pp. 72‚Äì76Niven, pp. 3‚Äì6 and 368‚Äì70The Evening Star October 14, 1924 page 4 At the time of the discovery of the remains in OCtober 1924 thee was speculation this was the remains of the Mackay party =March to Wrangel Island= Letter to Captain Bartlett signed by Alistair Forbes Mackay and his party, informing the captain of their decision to march for land independently Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.McKinlay, p. 78Niven, pp. 162‚Äì65 Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days.Bartlett, pp. 128‚Äì29 They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.Niven, p. 360 The frozen, disturbed surface of the sea around Wrangel Island Bartlett's party now consisted of eight Karluk crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the family of four and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, was one of the few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel.Leslie, p. 309 When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length. The ice surface was very broken up, making travel slow and difficult. At first the parties were able to travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties. However, recent storms had destroyed much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett's camp as his team slept.Niven, pp. 177‚Äì78 On 28 February all the parties came together in front of the first of a series of high ridges, from in height, that halted their progress. These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped and cut a pathway through the towering ridges. When McKinlay's group returned to the main party a week later, the path forward had been advanced by only three miles (5 km), but the worst of the ridges had been overcome.Leslie, pp. 310‚Äì11McKinlay, pp. 84‚Äì90 Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience. The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island. Bartlett's journey Bartlett's initial plan had been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on together to the Siberian coast. However, because three men‚ÄîMamen, Malloch and Maurer‚Äîwere injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik.Niven, p. 190 The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs),Bartlett, p. 180 and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties.Niven, pp. 196‚Äì98 After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett did his best to reassure him as they moved slowly forward.Bartlett, pp. 197‚Äì98 A group of North Siberian Chukchi, photographed in 1913 On 4 April the pair reached land near Cape Jakan, west of Cape North on the northern Siberian coast. The presence of sledge marks in the snow showed they had landed in an inhabited area.Niven, pp. 226‚Äì29 They followed these tracks for a day, before arriving at a small Chukchi village. Here, contrary to Kataktovik's fears, they were received hospitably, and given shelter and food.Leslie, p. 315 On 7 April they set out for East Cape. Bartlett had not previously experienced such relentlessly cold weather, with blizzards, hurricane-force winds, and temperatures often below . On the way they passed through several Chukchi villages, where Bartlett traded goods for necessary supplies‚Äîhe exchanged his Colt revolver for a young, strong dog.Niven, p. 230 Bartlett was touched by the kindness and generosity shown by many of those they encountered on the way, \\"typical of the true humanity of these kindly people\\". On 24 April they arrived at Emma Town, a settlement a few miles west of East Cape. Bartlett calculated that in the 37 days since leaving Wrangel Island, he and Kataktovik had travelled about , all but the last stage on foot.Niven, pp. 232‚Äì34 At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a distinguished Russian official who offered to take him to Emma Harbour on the coast, a week's journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and an attack of tonsillitis, said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), and set off with the baron.Niven, pp. 235‚Äì36 and p. 244 On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler Herman and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at St Michael, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of Karluk's fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the United States revenue cutter Bear, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.Niven, pp. 255‚Äì56 and pp. 258‚Äì59 On Wrangel Island Waring Pt., Rodgers Harbor) are indicated. The landfall from Shipwreck Camp had been on the north side of Wrangel Island, at a spot which they named \\"Icy Spit\\". Before his departure, Bartlett asked the party to set up several camps around the island, which would increase the hunting areas. The captain also felt that separation into smaller groups would assist general harmony by keeping incompatible characters apart.Niven, p. 192 He wanted all groups to reassemble at Rodgers Harbor, on the south side of the island, about the middle of July.McKinlay, p. 94 However, dissension broke out almost immediately after Bartlett's departure over the sharing of food. It had not been possible to drag all the supplies from Shipwreck Camp, and the trek had taken longer than expected; consequently there were shortages of biscuit, pemmican (a compound of dried meat, fat and sugar) and dog food. There was little prospect of augmenting supplies by hunting birds and game until the weather improved in May or June. When Hadley and the Inuit, Kuraluk, returned from a seal hunt on the ice, Hadley was widely suspected of concealing the proceeds of the hunt for his own consumption; the same pair were also accused of wasting scarce cooking oil.McKinlay, pp. 108‚Äì10 McKinlay records that the circumstances depressed morale and destroyed comradeship: \\"The misery and desperation of our situation multiplied every weakness, every quirk of personality, every flaw in character, a thousandfold.\\" Two attempts were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment.McKinlay, pp. 96‚Äì104 Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools.McKinlay, p. 105 McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.Niven, p. 203 The camp at Rodgers Harbor. Wrangel Island Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party: the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy. Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a \\"frightful smell\\", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.McKinlay, pp. 113‚Äì120 From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible.Niven, p. 300 and p. 321 The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson \\"Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported.\\"Niven, p. 289 Breddy was suspected of other thefts. On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent. The circumstances of his death, whether accident, suicide or in Hadley's view, murder (with Williamson as the chief suspect) could not be determined. Williamson later called Hadley's suspicions \\"hallucinations and absolutely untrue.\\" Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.Niven, pp. 287‚Äì88 and pp. 294‚Äì95McKinlay, pp. 135‚Äì36 Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of Dominion Day.Niven, p. 305 Later in the month the party's spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a walrus, which provided fresh meat for several days.Niven, pp. 307‚Äì08 As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the party began to prepare for another winter.Niven, pp. 327‚Äì29 Rescue The Karluk survivors after rescue, photographed with Captain Bartlett on board the rescue vessel Bear Left to right: Munro {back row}; Templeman {front row}; Williamson; Hadley; Captain Bartlett; Keruk {back row}; Mugpi {front row}; McKinlay {back row}; Kerdrillo {front row}; Williams {back row} Maurer The \\"Bear\\" and \\"Corwin\\" June 1914 The revenue cutter Bear arrived in St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, agreed to go to Wrangel Island as soon as he got permission from the United States government.Niven, pp. 264‚Äì65 It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe.Bartlett, p. 297 After receiving permission, Bear, with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue.Niven, pp. 302‚Äì03 On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing.Bartlett, p. 301 At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving Karluk the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.Bartlett, pp. 302‚Äì306 McConnell left Point Barrow for Nome aboard King and Winge, an American-registered walrus hunter, while Bear finally sailed for Wrangel Island.Niven, pp. 324‚Äì27 On 25 August Bear was stopped by ice from the island, and after failing to force a way through, Cochran had to return to Nome for more coal‚Äîa decision which, says Bartlett, gave him \\"days to try a man's soul\\".Bartlett, p. 309 Back in Nome Bartlett met Olaf Swenson, who had chartered King and Winge for the season and was about to sail for Siberia. Bartlett requested that, if possible, King and Winge stop by Wrangel Island and look for the stranded Karluk party. Bear left Nome on 4 September, a few days after Swenson's ship.Niven, pp. 333‚Äì334 King and Winge, with McConnell still aboard, reached Wrangel Island on 7 September. That morning the group at Rodgers Harbor were awakened early in the morning by the sound of a ship's whistle, and found King and Winge lying a quarter of a mile offshore. They were rapidly transferred to the ship, which then picked up the remainder of the stranded party who were camped along the coast at Waring Point. By the afternoon all 14 survivors were aboard.McKinlay, pp. 148‚Äì51 After a futile attempt to approach Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; next day she encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life.Cochran, pp. 79‚Äì86 The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.Bartlett, p. 323 Aftermath Bartlett, celebrated as a hero by press and public, was honoured for \\"outstanding bravery\\" by the Royal Geographical Society. However, he was later censured by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, and for allowing Mackay's party to leave the main group‚Äîdespite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed, absolving the captain from responsibility. Stefansson, too, was privately critical of Bartlett's conduct.Henighan, p. 62 Bartlett resumed his career at sea, and over the next 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic.Niven, pp. 357‚Äì67 During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies; he died, aged 70, in April 1946.Leslie, pp. 320‚Äì21 His account of the Karluk disaster, published in 1916, makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else; Niven records, however, that to his friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader. Kurruluk, Keruk and children, four of the survivors of the S.S. \\"Karluk\\" Stefansson's Canadian Arctic Expedition \\"Mugpi\\", the three-year-old child who with her family survived the ordeal of the Karluk voyage. In 1918 Stefansson returned after four years' absence, reporting the discovery of three new islands. He was honoured by the National Geographical Society, received tributes from polar veterans such as Peary and Adolphus Greely,McKinlay, p. 162 and was given the presidency of the Explorers Club of New York.Henigahan, p. 68 In Canada his reception was more muted; there were questions relating to the overall costs of the expedition, its poor initial organisation, and his handling of the Southern Party which, under Rudolph Anderson, completed its work independently of Stefansson.Henighan, pp. 69‚Äì74 Anderson and other members of the Southern Party later petitioned the Canadian government to investigate statements made by Stefansson in his 1921 book The Friendly Arctic, which they felt reflected poorly on their honour. The request was declined on the ground that \\"no good could come of the enquiry.\\" In his book Stefansson takes responsibility for the \\"bold\\" decision to take Karluk into the ice rather than hugging the coast on the way to Herschel Island, and accepts that he \\"chose the wrong alternative\\".Stefansson, p.48 However, McKinlay felt that the book gave an inaccurate account of the Karluk voyage and its consequences, \\"putting the blame ... on everyone but Vilhjalmur Stefansson.\\" The historian Tom Henighan believes that McKinlay's biggest complaint against his leader was that \\"Stefansson never at any time seemed able to express an appropriate sorrow over his lost men.\\"Henighan, p. 76 Stefansson, who never returned to the Arctic, died in 1962 at the age of 82.Leslie, pp. 321‚Äì22 The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party remained unknown until 1924, when an American vessel landed at Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established that this was Anderson's party. No cause of death was established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent had blown away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent. The mystery illness which affected most of the Wrangel Island party and accelerated the deaths of Malloch and Mamen was later diagnosed as a form of nephritis brought about by eating faulty pemmican. Stefansson explained this by saying that \\"our pemmican makers has failed us through supplying us with a product deficient in fat.\\"Stefansson, p. 486 Peary had emphasised that a polar explorer should \\"give his personal, constant and insistent attention\\" to the making of his pemmican; McKinlay believed that Stefansson had devoted too much time selling the idea of the expedition, and too little ensuring the quality of the food that its members would depend upon.Leslie, pp. 317‚Äì18 Of the survivors, Hadley continued working for the Canadian Arctic Expedition, becoming second officer and later master of the supply ship Polar Bear. He died of influenza, in San Francisco in 1918.Stefansson, p. 763 Hadley and McConnell wrote accounts of their experiences for Stefansson, who incorporated them in The Friendly Arctic. Chafe also wrote and published a short account. Most of the others quickly returned to relative obscurity, but in 1922, Fred Maurer was persuaded by Stefansson to join an attempt to colonise Wrangel Island. To the embarrassment of the Canadian government,Diubaldo, p. 161 Stefansson insisted on going ahead, even though Wrangel Island was indisputably part of what had then become the Soviet Union. A party of five, including Maurer, was sent to the island; only one, an Inuit woman Ada Blackjack, survived. Despite their ordeal, many of the Karluk survivors lived long lives; Williamson, who declined to speak or write of his experiences in the Arctic, lived to be 97, dying in Victoria, Canada, in 1975. McKinlay died in 1983, aged 95, having published his account of the expedition in 1976. Kuraluk, Kuruk and their daughters, Helen and Mugpi, returned to their former life at Point Barrow. The two girls, says P√°lsson, had provided \\"important sources of cheer at the darkest moments.\\"P√°lsson, p. 136 Mugpi, who later was known as Ruth Makpii Ipalook, became the very last survivor of the Karluk voyage, dying in 2008 after a full life, aged 97. Published voyage accounts Six first-hand accounts of Karluk's last voyage have been published. These include Stefansson's account which only covers the June to September 1913 period. Expedition secretary Burt McConnell wrote an account of the Wrangel Island rescue which was published in The New York Times, 15 September 1914. A version of McConnell's account appears in Stefansson's book. * 1914: Bartlett's story of the Karluk ‚Äì Robert Bartlett * 1916: The Last Voyage of the Karluk ‚Äì Robert Bartlett and Ralph Hale * 1918: The Voyage of the Karluk, and its Tragic Ending ‚Äì Ernest Chafe * 1921: The Friendly Arctic ‚Äì Vilhjalmur Stefansson * 1921: The Story of the Karluk ‚Äì John Hadley * 1976: Karluk: The great untold story of Arctic exploration ‚Äì William Laird McKinlay Notes and references =Notes= =References= Sources * (search ship \\"Karluk\\") * (search \\"Karluk\\")     (The book was republished in 1999 as The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster)  Further reading  External links * Bartlett's account of the disaster as reported to The New York Times shortly after his arrival in Alaska on 30 May 1914. * Letters sent by Stefansson from the Arctic, 1914‚Äì15. * ‚Äî Documentary, available for viewing on Hulu. * The Papers of John Munro at Dartmouth College Library Category:Shipwrecks in the Arctic Ocean Category:Arctic exploration vessels Category:Chukchi Sea Category:Alaska- related ships Karluk Karluk Category:Pre-statehood history of Alaska Category:20th century in the Arctic ","title":"Last voyage of the Karluk"},{"id":"862426","text":"RAGBRAI is an acronym and registered trademark for the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, which is a noncompetitive bicycle ride organized by The Des Moines Register. The ride goes across the state of Iowa from west to east, and draws recreational riders from across the United States and many foreign countries. First held in 1973, RAGBRAI is the largest bike-touring event in the world. Description Riders begin at a community on Iowa's western border and ride to a community on the eastern border, stopping in towns across the state. The ride is one week long, ending on the last Saturday of July each year, after beginning on the previous Sunday. The earliest possible starting date is July 19 and the latest is July 25. RAGBRAI holds an annual lottery that selects about 8,500 week-long riders. The lottery is held beginning November 15 of the previous year and until April 1. Random computer selection determines the participants. A registration form is available on the RAGBRAI website and can either be entered online or printed and mailed to the Des Moines Register. Entrants are notified of the lottery results by email on May 1. Also, passes on a first-come, first-served basis are made available for 1,500 day riders; these are limited to three per person. Additionally, Iowa bicycle clubs and charters, as well as teams and groups (many from out of state), receive a number of passes for which members apply through those organizations. Despite the official limits, unregistered riders have on many days swelled the actual number of riders to well over the registered number count. RAGBRAI is open to all kinds of people. The length of the entire week's route over RAGBRAI's first 40 years from 1973 through 2012, not including the Century Loop, averaged , with the average daily distance between host communities being . Eight \\"host communities\\" are selected each year, one each for the beginning and end points, the other six serving as overnight stops from Sunday through Friday for the bicyclists. At the beginning of the ride, participants have traditionally dipped the rear wheels of their bikes in or near the starting community. A dipping spot has always been set up in either the Missouri River or the Big Sioux River. At the end, the riders dip their front wheels in the Mississippi River. The 45th ride, RAGBRAI XLV, took place from July 23‚Äì29, 2017, beginning in Orange City, with overnight stops in Spencer, Algona, Clear Lake, Charles City, Cresco, and Waukon, before finishing in Lansing. In 2017, the \\"Mile of Silence\\", which remembers the riders who have been lost throughout the years, happened on the first day after leaving Granville. The optional 3rd Annual Gravel Loop also occurred the first day on the way to Sutherland.http://ragbrai.com/routemaps/2017-route- maps/ The 46th ride, RAGBRAI XLVI, was held from July 22‚Äì28, 2018, beginning in Onawa, with overnight stops in Denison, Jefferson, Ames, Newton, Sigourney, and Iowa City, before ending in Davenport. The 2019 (47th, RAGBRAI XLVII, July 21‚Äì27) began in Council Bluffs, with overnight stops in Atlantic, Winterset, Indianola, Centerville, Fairfield, and Burlington, ending in Keokuk. On April 20, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision was made to postpone the 48th ride, RAGBRAI XLVIII. The ride is scheduled to begin July 25, 2021, in Le Mars and end July 31 in Clinton, with stops in Storm Lake, Fort Dodge, Iowa Falls, Waterloo, Anamosa, and Maquoketa. =Overnight stops= The ride has passed through all 99 of Iowa's counties in its history. Fourteen communities have served as the starting point, while 12 have hosted the finish and 105 other communities have been overnight hosts during the week of the ride. An event known as the RAGBRAI Route Announcement Party is held the last part of January to release the names of the overnight towns. The route is fleshed out in the following weeks and is announced in the Register and on the RAGBRAI website in early March. Even after that, changes to the route have sometimes been made. History =The Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride (1973)= RAGBRAI began in 1973, when Des Moines Register feature writers John Karras and Donald Kaul decided to go on a bicycle ride across Iowa; both men were avid cyclists. Karras challenged Kaul to do the ride and write articles about what he experienced. Kaul agreed to do it, but only if Karras also did the ride. Karras then agreed to ride, as well. The newspaper's management approved of the plan. Don Benson, a public-relations director at the Register, was assigned to coordinate the event. Upon the suggestion of Ed Heins, the managing editor, the writers invited the public to accompany them. The ride was planned to start on August 26 in Sioux City and end in Davenport on August 31. The overnight stops were Storm Lake, Fort Dodge, Ames, Des Moines, and Williamsburg. The Register informed readers of the event and the planned route. The ride was informally referred to as \\"the Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride\\". Some 300 cyclists began the ride in Sioux City; 114 of them rode the entire route. A number of other people rode part of the route. Attendance was light the first year. The ride was announced with only six weeks' notice and it conflicted with the first week of school and the final weekend of the Iowa State Fair. After the ride was over, Kaul and Karras wrote numerous articles that captured the imaginations of many readers. Among those who completed the 1973 ride was 83-year-old Clarence Pickard of Indianola. He rode a used ladies Schwinn and wore a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, woolen long underwear, and a silver pith helmet. He said that the underwear blocked out the sun and kept his skin cool. The newspaper received many calls and letters from people who wanted to go on the ride, but were unable to for various reasons. Because of this public response and demand, a second ride was scheduled for August 4‚Äì10, 1974, before the Iowa State Fair. =Second year: SAGBRAI, August 4‚Äì10, 1974= The 1974 ride, known as the Second Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa (or SAGBRAI), was more carefully planned. For example, each morning, the official start time was 7:30 am; however, by Wednesday, the start time was dropped so that riders could depart at any time that was appropriate for the rider. The Iowa State Patrol was involved for the first time to control traffic safety, and arrangements were made to have medical services available for riders. For the first time, the route was driven in advance for inspection purposes. The start of the ride was in Council Bluffs, with the overnight communities of Atlantic, Guthrie Center, Camp Dodge (near Des Moines), Marshalltown, Waterloo, and Monticello, and the ride finishing in the riverfront city of Dubuque. The ride occurred in the same week as the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. The high point of the trip for many of the riders was the second overnight stop, where a sign greeted the riders outside of the designated overnight town, Guthrie Center. It read, \\"Please be kind. You outnumber us two to one.\\" About a half hour in length, SAGBRAI ‚Äì the Second Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa is a black and white documentary film about the 1974 ride. OHP Marketing Services of Webster City, Iowa, converted the 16-mm film to a digital format in 2012, and the digital format was screened in Webster City on Monday July 13, 2015. =As RAGBRAI annual event= After the second year, the ride continued to grow in popularity. Michael Gartner, then the editor of the Register, directed John Karras to include the word \\"Register\\" in the ride title; thus the RAGBRAI name, with Roman numerals following it, was adopted for RAGBRAI III in 1975 (the 2012 ride was RAGBRAI XL). RAGBRAI V, from Onawa to Lansing, was the shortest in RAGBRAI history at . Until 2014, it also had the fewest feet in vertical hill climbing. Beginning in 1978, RAGBRAI included a 100-mile century ride to offer a greater challenge. The second day of RAGBRAI IX came to be known as \\"Soggy Monday\\" and is generally regarded as the worst weather day in RAGBRAI history. To commemorate it, the Register marketed a bicycle patch. Beginning with RAGBRAI X, the dates were moved to the last full week in July, starting on Sunday and ending on Saturday. This ride was also the last for Donald Kaul as co-host; he had ridden with John Karras on the first ten rides. Chuck Offenburger, writer of the Register's \\"Iowa Boy\\" column, joined Karras as co- host in 1983. With XIV, RAGBRAI introduced a Century Loop. While the day's ride might be shorter, a loop was included on the route for cyclists who wanted to ride . This ride went from Council Bluffs to Muscatine, and the optional loop was on the day between Perry and Eldora. The loop was renamed the \\"Karras Loop\\" in 2001, in honor of John Karras. On the XXIII ride, the day from Tama-Toledo to Sigourney featured a strong south headwind, much heat and humidity, and many hills. The daycame to be known as \\"Saggy Thursday\\". After the XXV ride, which passed through Lucas County, RAGBRAI in its history had gone through all of Iowa's 99 counties. John Karras retired as co-host after the 2000 ride (XXVIII), which begin at Council Bluffs and ended at Burlington. RAGBRAI XLIII in 2015 was the first to feature an optional gravel loop. The loop was in honor of Steve Hed, a Minnesotan and wheel innovator who had died the previous November. The first gravel loop was part of the second-day ride from Storm Lake to Fort Dodge. Also, the 43rd ride was the first since the initial ride in 1973 to start in Sioux City and end in Davenport. Notable incidents =Deaths= Through the 2014 ride, 30 deaths of ride participants or volunteers officially occurred during the week of the ride, because of accidents or injuries suffered on the ride. Although the event began in 1973, the first death did not occur until RAGBRAI XII in 1984. Many of the deaths were due to heart attacks that riders suffered while resting. However, in Sheldon on the first night of the 2005 ride, a weather-related fatality occurred as Michael Thomas Burke (a native of Donnellson, Iowa and an industrial engineering graduate from the University of Iowa, who was living in New York City) died when a storm caused a tree limb to fall on him as he was sleeping in a tent. Only a few deaths resulted from injuries sustained while actually riding on bicycles. The first was in 1987, when 19-year-old John Boyle of Rockwell City fell under the wheels of a flatbed trailer. On Monday, July 30, 2007, at 12:52 pm, a Waterloo man, who was rescued from the Wapsipinicon River in Independence, subsequently died; 62-year-old Rich Droste had been participating in RAGBRAI, which made an overnight stop in Independence on Thursday. Droste was swimming in the Wapsi when he apparently got caught in the current upstream from the dam. On July 25, 2009, Donald D. Myers from Rolla, Missouri, died of injuries sustained in a crash at the bottom of the hill near Geode Lake dam at Geode State Park. On July 30, 2010, Stephen Briggs of Waverly, Iowa died after his bike clipped the tire of another bike and he was thrown from his bike. After Briggs' death, no more fatalities occurred until 2014, when on Monday, July 21, Tom Teesdale, 62, of West Branch died of a heart attack between Terril and Graettinger, and on Wednesday, July 23, George 'Frank' Brinkerhoff of Sioux City died of natural causes and was found dead in his tent Thursday morning. On Sunday, July 24, 2016, at the 2-mile marker on US Highway 34 near Glenwood, Wayne Ezell, 72, of Jacksonville, Florida, was westbound when a pickup truck driven by Robb Philippus, 34, of Glenwood, hit him from behind about 6:40 am. Ezell, who died from his injuries sustained during the accident, was a rider participating in RAGBRAI XLIV. Also, in 2016, on the Tuesday of RAGBRAI XLIV, a 60-year-old RAGBRAI rider, Clifton Kahler, had a heart attack while riding along Highway 2 between Creston and Leon and died. A plane carrying a pilot and a young Canadian woman who was making a documentary about the ride crashed during the course of the 2005 RAGBRAI. In this case, the pair suffered minor injuries. Pilot Jim Hill of Manchester, Iowa, and Amy Throop of Ottawa, Canada, were following the route on a plane near Riceville, Iowa, when the plane went down. Both Hill and Throop walked away from the accident. Throughout the ride, ultralights have flown over riders a few feet above the trees to get good shots of the riders. =Crawford County lawsuit and ban= During 2004's RAGBRAI XXXII, Kirk Ullrich was thrown from his bicycle after contacting a crack in the center of the road and died. Ullrich's widow Betty Jo Ullrich sued Crawford County and settled for $350,000. The board of supervisors for Crawford County banned RAGBRAI (and other, similar events) to avoid future liability. As of December 2008, however, Crawford County supervisors voted to rescind this ban after the RAGBRAI organizers took steps to indemnify third parties in the case of such events in the future. =2013 sinkhole along XLI route= On May 31, 2013, a large sinkhole, at least wide by deep, occurred along Iowa Highway 384 (160th Road in Guthrie County) under the asphalt at the entrance of Springbrook State Park, which is near the boat ramp at the base of Mockingbird Hill. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) contacted the Iowa Department of Transportation, which deemed the sinkhole to be unsafe. The Iowa DNR immediately evacuated the campers at Springbrook. In the spring (March, April, and May) of 2013, according to Harry Hillaker, the state of Iowa climatologist, Iowa had the wettest spring on record. The record precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, contributed to the formation of the sinkhole. On June 3, 2013, the RAGBRAI XLI route inspection preride assessed the sinkhole in considering changes to the route through Springbrook and up Mockingbird Hill, the steepest hill on any RAGBRAI route; however, no changes to the RAGBRAI XLI route were made. Food vendors During RAGBRAI, food and drink are available at nominal cost in campgrounds, churches, and restaurants, and along the route. Vendors who are officially sanctioned are identified by a sign reading, OFFICIAL RAGBRAI VENDOR. Many offer a discount to riders who have a participant wristband. Perhaps the most famed vendor in RAGBRAI history was Paul Bernhard, who along the day's route at a rural location sold corn on the cob and pork chops that were basted in melted butter and grilled over charcoal. He began selling chops at RAGBRAI in 1985 and retired after the 2008 ride, leaving the vendorship to his son, Matt. In 1996, he sold 2500 chops in his hometown of Bancroft, Iowa, when the ride passed through there. He was called Mr. Pork Chop and was known for his cry of \\"Pooooork Chooooooooooop!\\" He died at age 88. Teams and charters An example of a RAGBRAI team bus Riders come from all over the world, and many ride as clubs or teams. Dozens of organized teams go on the ride. In 2007 and 2008, Lance Armstrong organized a LIVESTRONG team of about 200 riders and participated in RAGBRAI; each rider raised $1000 or more towards fighting cancer. Teams create a social and support system that adds a noncycling dimension to RAGBRAI. While some of the teams have a well-earned reputation for hard partying and heavy drinking, most are serious bicyclists. Teams often customize old school buses and vans. The team buses serve as transportation to and from the ride, and a combination clubhouse and sleeping quarters during the ride. These buses typically sport enormous custom stereos, roof mounted, rail-equipped platforms, which serve as bicycle racks and a place to relax, and interior bathrooms. Several carry 55-gallon plastic water barrels, which become warm during the day. Attached to a gravity-fed hose, they provide teams with a spartan shower at the end of the day's ride. Teams often conform their clothing or partake in certain gimmicks to add levity to the ride and make team members easily identifiable. This can be as simple as wearing identical cycling jerseys with the team logo or various wacky traditions such as purple ‚Äútroll hair‚Äù wigs (Team Spin). Gimmicks include adorning road kill along the route with Mardi Gras beads (Team Road Kill), various drinking games, and a team who carries 5-gallon buckets on their bicycles and challenge riders to ‚ÄúGet on the Bucket‚Äù and get tackled off of it by a team member or friend to raise awareness for cancer research (Team Tacklebucket). Many teams also produce logoed team paraphernalia to distribute and trade with other teams (stickers, bracelets, or can koozies being common items). Charters are bicycle clubs and for-profit companies that provide weeklong support for riders. For a fee, charters typically transport riders to and from the ride, secure preferred camping areas, rent and sometimes pitch tents, provide some bicycle repair services, and offer additional evening social activities. Charters are a common option for riders coming from outside Iowa. 243x243px Team Gourmet, based in Chicago, is a group that currently works RAGBRAI and has done so for more than 20 years. They travel with three chefs, who prepare elaborate meals that are served at 6:00 pm. Membership in the team for RAGBRAI and the cuisine included cost around $900. Another charter from Chicago is CUBS, which stands for Chicago Urban Bicycling Society, formed in 1996 especially to ride RAGBRAI. Other charters and clubs involved with RAGBRAI XLII in 2014 include: Team Jorts, Bicycle Illinois, Shuttleguy, Brancel Charters, Bubba's Pampered Pedalers, Out of Staters, Pork Belly Ventures, Riverbend Bike Club, Quad Cities Bicycle Club, Lost & Found Adventures, Bike World, Lake Country Cyclist Ankeny, RAGBRAI In Style, Emmetsburg Bike Club, Bikes To You, Bicyclists of Iowa City, Iowa Valley Bicycle Club, North Iowa Touring Club, Melon City Bike Club, Cedar Valley Cyclists, The Pfalcons, Overland Touring Charter, Padre's Cycle Inn, and Ron Oman Charters. The Sprint Selzer Bicycle Club is among the longest-running clubs in existence, having formed at RAGBRAI III, by creating a fictional celebrity named Sprint. Media exposure RAGBRAI has had nationwide media exposure, and other rides based on RAGBRAI have been started in other areas of the country. Bil Gilbert, after riding in SAGBRAI, wrote an enthusiastic report that appeared in Sports Illustrated. Harry Smith of CBS This Morning rode part of RAGBRAI XXV in 1997 and aired a report. In addition, numerous articles about the ride have appeared over the years in The Wall Street Journal. Celebrities and athletes Ben Davidson, former professional football star player mainly with the Oakland Raiders, rode on RAGBRAI for several years, beginning in 1987. Lance Armstrong rode the Wednesday and Thursday stages in 2006, speaking to a large throng of the riders in Newton. He then completed most of the 2007 ride before leaving a couple of days early to support Team Discovery's Alberto Contador and his Tour de France victory. In 2008, Armstrong also made an appearance on the Ames, Iowa, leg of the trip. In 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018, he again participated. Ottumwa-born actor/comedian Tom Arnold has ridden a few RAGBRAIs, including XXIV in 1996. Other participants have included three-time Tour de France champ Greg LeMond, columnist Dave Barry, NASCAR drivers Matt Kenseth and Jimmie Johnson, Motocross champion Ryan Dungey, 2004 Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean and former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt.
