When he joined the NFL as an official in 1962 from the Southeastern Conference, he was given the referee position, and stayed at that spot until his retirement in 1976. He officiated Super Bowl III in 1969 and Super Bowl VII in 1973. He is also the only official in history to referee in both a Super Bowl and NCAA Final Four (1959). He retired from the NFL following the 1976 AFC Championship Game between the Oakland Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers, played December 26, 1976, to conclude a fifteen-year career in the league. Bell was given a choice of officiating the AFC Championship game or Super Bowl XI as his final NFL game by then-Director of Officiating Art McNally. When Bell chose the former, Jim Tunney was selected as the referee for his second Super Bowl. His successor as a referee, Jerry Markbreit, was the line judge on Bell's crew in 1976, Markbreit's rookie year in the NFL. Bell wore uniform number 7 throughout his NFL career. The number was not used during the 1977 and 1978 NFL seasons; fellow referee Fred Silva took the number in 1979 and wore it through his retirement in 1988. Ron Blum, who wore number 83 as a line judge from 1985 through 1992, changed to No. 7 upon his promotion to referee in 1993 and wore it through his retirement in 2007, even though he returned to his original position for his final four NFL seasons. Side judge Keith Washington currently wears No. 7. Unlike nearly all other professional football officials, Bell did not have to serve an apprenticeship at another position before becoming a referee. He was the last official to be a referee in his rookie season until Brad Allen was hired in 2014. Personal In addition to NFL officiating, Bell was an attorney in Lexington, Kentucky, and provided color commentary on Kentucky Wildcats football broadcasts on radio and television following his retirement.

History The East Carolina Railway was incorporated in Tarboro in 1898, organized and initially presided over by Henry Clark Bridgers, Sr., nephew of Robert Rufus Bridgers who was president of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad. Constructed using prison labor from Raleigh, the tracks reached Pinetops, North Carolina by July 1900, Macclesfield, North Carolina by September 1900, and in 1901 it extended all the way to Farmville. In 1908 the line was extended 12 miles to Hookerton, North Carolina but this segment was abandoned in 1933 during the Great Depression.Smith, W. Terry, \\"Farmville collector shares passion for railroads with Tarboro \\", Daily Southerner, Tarboro, North Carolina, 3 September 2010 The railroad was acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) in 1935, but continued to be locally managed by Henry Clark Bridgers until his death in 1951. The railway continued to be operated under the East Carolina Railway name until the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad abandoned the line in 1965. The last train ran on 16 November 1965. In 1960 East Carolina reported 1.1 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and no passengers on its 29-mile railroad. Operations The operating schedule as of 10 November 1903, according to the August 1904 edition of the \\"Official Guide of the Railways and Steam Navigation Lines of the United States, Porto Rico [sic], Canada, Mexico and Cuba\\" showed the departure of a train from Tarboro at 9:40 a.m. Eastern time, arriving at Farmville, 26 miles away, at 11:25 a.m. on Monday-Tuesday, and Thursday- Friday.

They were rebuilt in the Tarboro shops as gasoline-powered motor cars for passenger use, and saw about 17 years of service.

CBI-India, The Times of India  Love and marriage  Rizwanur Rahman, a middle-class man, met the 23-year-old Priyanka Todi, daughter of Ashok Todi, owner of Lux Cozi, at the graphics training school where he taught. They began an affair, which was kept secret from their families.\\"What the Todis have to say\\", The Times of India It is believed that on 18 August 2007, the two secretly married according to the Special Marriage Act to which a few close friends and colleagues of Rizwanur were witnesses. The two families were not informed about the marriage and no witnesses were declared in the case later on. After the ceremony, Priyanka went back to the Todi family, and Rizwanur continued his work at the multi- media centre. In late August, Rizwanur Rahman approached his brother and confessed to having secretly married. On 31 August, he brought Priyanka home to his family's small apartment in a working class Muslim neighbourhood. He and Priyanka signed and sent a letter to the police asking for protection from her father. Later, Priyanka would say: \\"My mind was a blank...

Rahman refused to yield. This is an unsubstantiated allegation levelled against the police force, not against Priyanka's parents, and there is nothing in official records to indicate that any such thing happened. What is on record is a meeting held at the police station on 8 September, eight days after Rahman's marriage was certified. On this occasion, the police summoned Rahman and strongly urged him to allow his wife to visit her parents for a week or so. They told him that he was liable to be arrested on various charges, including abduction and illegal confinement, if his wife remained confined inside his tiny, rundown house; also that there was a minor charge against him of stealing a cell phone and other items from the Todi mansion, He was told that the girl, Priyanka, had never spoken to her parents properly after disappearing from the house one fine day, and that the parents were totally aghast and bewildered. Rizwan was always present when Priyanka spoke to her parents, and because of his presence, the conversations were necessarily stilted and stifled, with no mutual understanding in sight. Also, Priyanka was speaking only in very brief sentences, monosyllables, yes-no answers and low voice to her parents. It was suspected that she was under pressure from Rizwan; perhaps she was scared of him and his family, perhaps she was unable to speak frankly and clearly to her parents. The police therefore strongly felt that Priyanka should return to her parental house for a week or so, during which time she could speak clearly to her parents and explain what had happened, and also convince them that she was happy. Rahman continued for a long time to resist the arguments of the police. He finally agreed to let Priyanka visit her parents, but only after he had obtained a signed document stating that she would return to him after a week. One of Priyanka's uncles, who was present at the police headquarters, signed an agreement on plain paper in front of a police witness that Priyanka would be sent back to Rahman's house after 7 days, on 15 September.\\"Doubts over suicide claim ‚Äì Top cops‚Äô role under cloud, The Telegraph, Calcutta ‚Äì 24 September 2007 After all this was done, and on the same day (08 Sept), Priyanka returned to the house of her parents.

Fallout  Even before the post-mortem results were released, the then Police Commissioner, Prasun Mukherjee, brushed aside the death of Rahman as a \\"simple case of suicide\\". He added that cases of eloping, even by adults, were unacceptable morally. So the police had always intervened in such cases in the past, and would continue to do so in the future. He made the infamous statement, \\"If the police does not interfere in these (family) matters, who will do it? PWD (Public Works Department)?\\". When pressed on the legality of his comments (the Supreme Court had previously ruled that a legal inter-religious marriage should be protected by the police), the commissioner became angry and left the conference. During primary investigations by the media, it was revealed that Mukherjee met the brother of Ashok Todi a few days after Rizwanur got married, and assured him of help from the police force to separate the couple. Mukherjee is also the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal. He won this post without contest due to an active support from the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mr. Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, and also alleged financial support from Ashok Todi. The suicide theory has been challenged by reports in the media.

Its taxonomic status is controversial.Peterson, Alan P. (Editor). 1999. Zoological Nomenclature Resource (Zoonomen). Accessed 2007-10-7. Distribution and habitat This species is locally common in areas with bushes or trees (possibly including mangroves), near water or waterlogged, in the Venezuelan coastal lowlands (below 100m) from southern Delta Amacuro to southeastern Sucre. Description The black-dotted piculet resembles other members of the genus Picumnus. Its most distinctive mark is pale pure yellow underparts with sparse black dots on the lower breast and usually on the belly and undertail coverts. In southeastern Sucre, a few have finely barred chests. Rare individuals with scaly throats and pale buffy (rather than yellow) underparts resemble the scaled piculet, which can be distinguished by its scaly lower underparts. The crown is black with narrow scarlet streaks on the forepart and conspicuous white dots on the rear part, or throughout in some females. The upperparts are light olive-brown, slightly yellowish, with dusky spots on the shoulders and back. The song is \\"2 to several extremely high, thin notes, each slightly lower than the preceding, tseeet, tseeet, tsee, etc.\\" Possibly it is also used as a contact call. Foraging birds may repeat the song a few times and then fall silent for several minutes. Behavior Birds of this species forage in pairs, often widely separated, or alone. They occasionally join mixed-species flocks. They often \\"hitch sideways along branches,\\" and they peck or drill like woodpeckers in rotting wood and at broken ends of branches. Taxonomy The taxonomy of Picumnus is controversial, and this taxon has been considered conspecific with the white-bellied piculet, conspecific with the golden-spangled piculet, and a synonym (incorrect name) of a subspecies of the scaled piculet (P. squamulatus obsoletus). Here it is considered a separate species following the Handbook of the Birds of the World, which supports this view with a summary of unpublished data from M. Lentino.

Wasserman was a librarian, and his broad vision helped the program get on its feet. He was constantly traveling and recruiting international faculty members and students. Wasserman would later write an autobiography which is available at McKeldin Library. The school's original name was the School of Library and Information Services and by 1972 it had established its location in Hornbake Library's South Wing. The school attained full accreditation from the American Library Association (it has never lost its accreditation) in 1966 and the first PhD students were in 1967. In 1991 the school had a major crisis as it was very close to being shut down. In 1993 Ann Prentice became dean of the school. During this time period the University of Maryland's Provost prompted a general review of the school and a reexamination of the goals and mission statement. The Provost wanted to promote more innovation, creation, research and services. Therefore, the school went through significant changes as the MLS curriculum was revised and the school started to morph into what it is now, an iSchool. Bruce Dearstyne took over as Interim Dean in 2001, after Prentice retired, and the transformation continued under his leadership. His signature initiative was introduction of the Master of Information Management program (MIM). In 2005, Jenny Preece became Dean. Under Preece, the MIM program has grown substantially. In the 2007 school year the MIM program had its highest student body count at 149. In addition, under Preece's directorship, a new master's program was added, Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction. In the summer of 2015, Brian Butler took over as interim dean as Jenny Preece stepped down. Keith Marzullo is the new incoming dean from the summer of 2016. =List of Deans= *Paul Wasserman: 1965-1970 *Michael Reynolds (interim): 1970 *James Liesener (interim): 1970-1971 *Margaret Chisholm: 1971-1975 *Henry Duebster (interim) *Keith Wright: 1977-1980 *Michael Reynolds (interim) *Anne MacLeod (interim) *Claude Walston: 1983-1992 *Ann Prentice: 1993-2001 *Bruce Dearstyne (interim): 2001-2005 *Charles Lowry (interim): 2005 *Jenny Preece: 2005‚Äì2015 *Brian Butler (interim): 2015-2016 *Keith Marzullo: 2016-onwards Challenges The iSchool has faced several challenges throughout its history. =Crisis of 1991= In the 1980s there was heated debate over whether Library Schools should be a part of major research-oriented universities. The University of Chicago's Graduate Library School was closed in 1989 and its closing was attributed to \\"the divorce of the School's research activities from what the profession perceived as its needs for training.\\" Shortly thereafter, in 1990, Columbia University's School of Library Service was closed. There were reports of fierce opposition from tenured faculty to sever ties to all library communities and reorient priorities to support newly emerging information communities as well as deemphasize professionally relevant education and practitioner connections.Crowley, Bill. Spanning the Theory-Practice Divide in Library & Information Science. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2005. In 1991, coupled with the economic downturn (the University had implemented furloughs as well) there was a call for the iSchool at Maryland to be shut down. It was proposed that the school became a department rather than a self-standing college. There was a public, open meeting where the issue was debated. The school was given support by Representative Steny Hoyer. In addition, past deans, faculty and alumni were on hand to counter the proposal. Former students spoke up in defense of the program, attributing their successes in public service jobs to the college's educational programs. The school was able to avoid being shut down. =Transition Phase= In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), there was a period of transition within the iSchool. There was a general realization that the field was changing and that the business model was changing. With the advent of the Web and search engines there were changes in how information was being gathered and consumed. There would be more of a demand for \\"Information Technology Professionals\\" rather than Librarians. During this time, there was a lot of funding going to the Human Computer Interaction Lab at the University and with the perceived growth of technology the lab was moved into the South wing of Hornbake Library where the iSchool was located. This move caused some tension as the iSchool's teaching library was disbanded and in its place faculty offices and research facilities were set up to accommodate the growth of the school. There was a fight to keep the iSchool's library - there were protests and petitions but none were fruitful and the library was removed from Hornbake. There was a recognized opportunity to train professionals for the corporate world and so when Dearstyne took over he helped lead the school as it introduced the new MIM program. Some faculty felt like the school was abandoning its \\"ontology\\" and abandoning libraries as an institution. There wasn't necessarily resistance to the MIM but rather to a second master's program in general. The question, \\"not will it be\\" but \\"what will it be\\" defined the debates. Despite initial concerns, the school has seen a steady rise in acceptance and interest. 2007 was a record year for the MIM program in number of students (149). In 2009 U.S. News & World Report recognized Maryland‚Äôs iSchool as one of the top information schools in the country, ranking it 10th among all public universities http://grad- schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library- information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings Community As part of a major research university the iSchool has initiated and led many programs both internally and externally that have helped serve the community. =Inside the iSchool= HCIL The Human Computer Interaction Lab, located in the South wing of Hornbake, has had ties with the community for many years. The Information Policy and Access Center (iPAC) \\"The Information Policy and Research Center (iPAC) is a research and education facility that explores social, policy, and technology aspects of information access and use across cultural institutions, government agencies, and other information-based organizations; communities; and populations. Researchers at iPAC study what policies and/or technologies lead to equitable and inclusive information access, a digitally literate population, and an informed and engaged public.\\"Centers & Research Labs.

Ethics and Values in Design Lab (EViD)  The EViD lab, led by Dr. Katie Shilton, focuses on the way that ethics and policy affect the design and use of technology. EViD is part of both CASCI and iPAC. Notable Faculty and Accomplishments *Dr. Diane Barlow helped develop a proposal in 1993 that awarded tuition to women who were part-time students. 6-8 students were chosen and their tuition remitted so they could complete the program. The initiative was part of the school's goal to help provide monetary relief to students during bad economic times. *Dr. Barlow and Dr. Prentice helped initiate a collaboration and exchange program with a Chinese Institution in Beijing. *Dr. Barlow helped expand the school's reach to Shady Grove and now the school has extended its educational reach. *During Prentice's deanship there was an increased demand for Library Media Specialists in the state of Maryland. Prince George's County, Howard County and Montgomery County entered into an agreement with the school where tuition was taken care of for a certain number of students who entered the program. In exchange these students committed to working for the county for a period of time. =Outside the iSchool= Research Support There has been research support for the iSchool from National Science Foundation, Google, IBM, Microsoft, the Library of Congress and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Kidsteam Children, ages 7‚Äì11, work with HCIL faculty/staff/students after school and over the summer to create new technologies for children. Curriculum = Bachelor of Science in Information Science = Started in 2016, the undergraduate program in Information Science is one of the most recent additions to the undergraduate majors offered at the University of Maryland in College Park. Its goal is to educate students in an interdisciplinary curriculum with aspects from computer science, business, and psychology. In the iSchool, this bachelors program is meant to focus on how \\"information, people, and technology\\" come together within the field of Information Science. Undergraduate students focused on this major will learn skills related to online website development essential to the work force. These skills include database design, web and mobile development, and data analytics. These students will also prepare for leadership and management roles while taking humanities classes and engaging in internships. https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci =MLIS= The Master of Library & Information Science Program educates students in the knowledge, skills, habits of thought and inquiry, and ethics of the library and information professions to enable them to be leaders in the state, national, and global information society. The program for the MLIS degree requires 36 credit hours of academic work to be completed with a minimum average of B within five calendar years from the first registration. In the non -thesis option, all credits are coursework. The thesis option requires 30 credits of coursework and six credits of thesis research. The usual and recommended course of study for a full-time student is approximately 18‚Äì24 months. As of 2018, the program offered seven specializations: Archives and Digital Curation, Diversity and Inclusion, Intelligence and Analytics, Legal Informatics, School Library, Youth Experience, and the Individualized Program Plan. In addition, there was a Certificate in Museum Scholarship and Material Culture, and a joint program offering the MLIS alongside a master's degree in history.. =MIM= The MIM program trains information technology professionals who know how to strategically manage information and technology and who understand the issues of information management, business management, computer science, and information systems. The MIM degree requires 36 credit hours of academic work to be completed with a minimum average of B within five calendar years from the first registration. A unique component of the MIM program is the pair of project courses taken at the end of the coursework. One of the courses involves a team project focused on solving an actual information management project at a real-world organization, and the other is an individual project. Each of these courses carry three credits, and require about 120 hours of work per student over a regular semester of three months. As of 2018, the program offered six specializations: Data Analytics, Strategic Management, User Experience, Technology Development, Individualized Program Plan, and Information Management Research. =HCIM= The Master of Science in Human- Computer Interaction degree integrates information studies, computer science, education, psychology and engineering to prepare HCI leaders of the future. Through coursework and research experiences, students in this program will develop skills in: *Fundamentals of Human-Computer Interaction *Advanced research methods *Usability analysis and testing *Social computing strategies and technologies *Technology design =Doctoral Program= Students must complete a minimum of 25 graduate credit hours while matriculated at the University of Maryland (or 28 hours if basic statistics is taken as a graduate course). Course-work will be taken in three areas of study which include: Information Studies (6 credit hours); Research Methods and Design (10 credit hours) and specialized area(s) (9 credit hours). All students have a First Year Review the first full academic year that a student takes his/her first doctoral seminar. Students prepare a portfolio that self-evaluates progress. This may include papers written for coursework or research, a presentation on a research topic and/or reviews by previous course instructors. A committee of at least three faculty members, a majority of whom must be members of the iSchool faculty, will review the work and inform the student in writing of the results. Students do not take comprehensive exams, but instead write an Integrative Paper that synthesizes and applies knowledge from broad areas of the information field. A committee of at least three faculty members, a majority of whom must be members of the iSchool faculty, approves the topic and abstract of the paper, and certifies its successful completion. The paper will typically be written after completion of coursework or equivalent experience (e.g., extensive work in a research environment) and must be completed and approved before advancement to candidacy. Students are required to successfully defend a dissertation to complete the program.

Valley City was outfitted as a gunboat and served blockade duty as well as performing surveillance duty.  Constructed at Philadelphia in 1859  Valley City‚Äîa wooden-hulled screw- steamer built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1859‚Äîwas purchased by the Union Navy at New York City on 26 July 1861; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 13 September 1861, Lt. James C. Chaplin in command.  Civil War operations  = Assigned to the Potomac Flotilla = The next day, Valley City left New York to join the Potomac Flotilla commanded by Capt. Thomas T. Craven. She arrived in the Potomac River off Occoquan Creek, Virginia, on the 17th and began patrol and reconnaissance duties. She exchanged gunfire with a Confederate battery at Freestone Point, Virginia, on 25 September. = Reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockade = Valley City was reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough in October but first put into the Baltimore Navy Yard, Maryland, for emergency repairs to her funnel. After a brief stop in Hampton Roads late in December, the repaired steamer was deployed with the blockade off Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, on 4 January 1862. Valley City remained off Hatteras Inlet for one month and then participated in the successful amphibious assault upon Roanoke Island, North Carolina, on 7 and 8 February. The victory closed supply lines to the Confederate-held Norfolk Navy Yard and was largely responsible for the evacuation of that vital naval facility three months later. Following the capture of Roanoke Island, Valley City assisted in the capture of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, on the 10th. = Gunner awarded Medal of Honor for sitting on an open barrel of gunpowder during a fire= During the attack, a shot passed through the steamer's magazine and exploded in a locker containing fireworks. When Lt. Chaplin and others went below to extinguish the fire, they found Quarter Gunner John Davis seated calmly above an open barrel of powder to keep the fire out, while passing powder to the upper deck. For his incredible valor on this occasion, Davis received the Medal of Honor. Valley City remained in the North Carolina sounds and participated in the capture of New Berne on 13 and 14 March and the subsequent clearing of the Neuse River. She returned to Baltimore, Maryland, for repairs on 2 June. = Patrol and reconnaissance duties = In September, Valley City was assigned patrol and reconnaissance duty in Virginia's York River. She was reassigned to Plymouth, North Carolina, on 25 October to protect Union troops stationed there. On the evening of 2 November, she led a reconnaissance expedition up the Roanoke River to Hamilton which she left a week later and returned to New Berne. In January 1863, the vessel returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for a new propeller and underwent further repairs and alterations at Baltimore, Maryland, before deploying off Washington, D.C., in April. Valley City fired upon Confederate positions near Blounts Creek, North Carolina, on 15 April, then left to join Lt. Charles W. Flusser's command at Plymouth on 19 April. Valley City performed routine patrol and reconnaissance duties off Plymouth through July. On the 26th, the steamer helped to protect Union forces ashore during a joint expedition up the Chowan River, North Carolina. Later, while serving as a mail steamer, the vessel collided with the U.S. transport Vidette on 21 September and suffered one fatality. Valley City sailed for Hampton Roads on 27 November and proceeded on to Baltimore for repairs and did not return to New Berne until 19 February 1864, when she resumed her now familiar patrol and reconnaissance activities. = Evacuation of Washington, N.C. = Valley City was present at the evacuation of Washington, N.C., in May and captured the schooner M. O'Neill there on 5 May. During the summer months of May through September 1864, the steamer played an important role in support of Union forces ashore and afloat in scattered operations in the Roanoke, Chowan, Pamlico, Pungo, and Scuppernong rivers of North Carolina. On 28 October, Valley City plucked Lt. William Barker Cushing from the Roanoke River after his daring, successful torpedo attack upon the Confederate ram CSS Albemarle at Plymouth and, from 29 October to 1 November, assisted in the recapture of Plymouth itself. While on an expedition up the Roanoke River on 20 December, the vessel suffered two casualties in a surprise attack by hidden Confederate shore batteries at Poplar Point, North Carolina. = End-of-war activity = Valley City remained active during the last few months of the war, rendering assistance to a Union Army expedition to Colerain, North Carolina, in January 1865, and participating in a reconnaissance patrol up the Chowan River to Winton, North Carolina, in early April. In May, , Valley City, and a picket boat captured a motley collection of small Confederate watercraft during a sweep of the Roanoke River and also dragged the bottom for sunken guns and unexploded torpedoes (mines).  Decommissioning  Early in the summer, the steamer returned north and was sold at public auction at New York City on 15 August 1865. She was redocumented for merchant service on 28 December and was lost at sea off Cape San Blas, Florida, on 30 January 1882.  Shipwreck  The shipwreck was identified in September 2009 by Michael C. Barnette and divers from the Association of Underwater Explorers.

With the entry of the United States into the war, it was quickly realized that amphibious combat operations on hostile shores would be required, and that specialized ships would be needed for the purpose. The so-called \\"attack transport\\" ship type (hull classification symbol APA) was developed to meet this need. Attack transports were converted from standard transport vessels by being upgraded with extra firepower, and outfitted with a number of smaller integral landing craft (such as LCVPs and LCMs) with which amphibious assaults could be conducted. The first attack transports began to enter service in 1942 and were built ad hoc from a host of different types. The first class to be built in substantial numbers was the Bayfield class, which began to enter service in 1943. The early vessels were converted from existing cargo or transport ships, later ones built as attack transports from the keel up. Overview Bayfield-class vessels were based on the large Type C3 passenger and cargo ship standard set by the US Maritime Commission. Originating in 1938, The C3 standard was designed to produce modern, good quality cargo and passenger ships to replace the ageing US merchant fleet, and which could also be readily converted into naval auxiliary vessels in the event of war. After the war broke out however, the need for shipping became so great that the US was forced to come up with designs that could be more quickly manufactured. Thus the C3-based Bayfield class and its predecessors were eventually outnumbered by the which was based on the simpler Victory ship design. Description A loaded Bayfield-class attack transport underway, Bayfield-class vessels were based upon the C3-S-A2 design standard. The basic design had to undergo a number of changes in order to meet the attack transport specification. =Troop accommodation= In order to accommodate the troops, two cargo holds amidships had to be converted into accommodation facilities. This was achieved by dividing each hold into three decks, and then building a number of passageways along each deck. Along both walls of each passageway, bunk-beds tiered five high were installed, and each bunk was only thirty inches wide. The troops were provided with their own galley and mess hall separate from that of the ship's crew, but they had no dining hall and used their own mess gear to eat. A sick bay and dental clinic were also provided. The troop commander had his own private cabin and office, which was fitted with a loudspeaker system from which he could directly address the men under his command. In order to keep the soldiers entertained during their long, crowded voyages, music and other entertainment could be piped to the troop compartments. =Ballast= Because a troop transport carries less weight than a cargo ship, it was also found to be useful to place concrete in the bottom of the cargo holds in order to improve the ship's comfort, safety and performance.Information for the \\"Ballast\\" and \\"Troop accommodation\\" sections comes from Maudsley, pp 75‚Äì76 (see references below). =Weaponry= Since attack transports would be conducting operations off hostile shores, they had a greater requirement for armament than ordinary transports, particularly in regards to antiaircraft defence. The Bayfield- class vessels were well outfitted in this regard. Each vessel was fitted with a pair of 5\\"/38 caliber dual purpose guns, one fore and one aft. The ships were also fitted with between two and four twin 40 mm antiaircraft mounts (early examples came with two quad 1.1\\" gun mounts instead), plus two single 40 mm mounts and eighteen 20 mm mounts as standard. As the war progressed, the 20 mm cannon were found to be less effective than the 40 mm, and the later Gilliam and Haskell classes dispensed with some of these mounts. The later classes also had only one gun instead of two. Production A total of 34 Bayfield-class vessels were produced between 1942 and 1944 ‚Äì 20 by Ingalls Shipbuilding of Pascagoula, Mississippi and the remaining 14 at the San Francisco shipyard of Western Pipe & Steel ‚Äì making the Bayfield class the second most numerous attack transport class behind the Haskell class. Service Bayfield-class vessels served in both the Atlantic and Pacific theatres of war. Some went on to see service in the Korean and Vietnam wars. Of the 388 attack transports (APA and AKA) of all types built, the last to see service with the US Navy was ,Mawdsley, page 141. a Bayfield-class vessel built by Western Pipe & Steel which was launched on 29 December 1942, first commissioned on 7 December 1943 and decommissioned in August 1970. She was finally struck from the Navy register on 1 July 1972. Footnotes References *Bayfield-class specifications, DANFS Online (See class specifications.

History 1875 marked the erection of the Batesville schoolhouse which was a two-story, four room brick building. To keep up with the increasing population there was an addition made to the schoolhouse in 1888, and in 1896 a second schoolhouse was built. As the town continued to grow it became apparent that a stand-alone high school was needed. Batesville High School was constructed in 1927 on a large plot of land donated to the Batesville school system by George M. Hillenbrand. In 1963, the Batesville schools consolidated with the schools of Hamburg, St. Mary's and Oldenburg, which marks the beginning of the Batesville Community School Corporation. With the rapid growth of the school district it again became necessary for the school corporation to build a new high school. Construction on the new high school finished in the fall of 1968, and still serves as the home to Batesville High School. Growing enrollment in the district has resulted in a $12 million addition to BHS in 2000 and another $10 million addition in 2017.

Adjacent to the school's main car and coach park, which is situated at the front of the buildings, lies the Annan public swimming baths and associated car park. History The original Annan Academy, founded in 1802, was housed in a building in the town's Port St until 1820, when the council built new school premises in Ednam St. From there it moved to further new buildings in Greenknowe in 1840, and these were later replaced by larger ones with a distinctive bell-tower in 1895, which are still in use today and house the school's library; the original building was built by George McIldowie. The latter red sandstone buildings were joined during an expansion in the 1960s by several new buildings of contemporary style and construction, enabling it to accept more pupils from a wider catchment area.

Peter became embroiled in King Henry's attempts to acquire the kingdom of Sicily, and Peter's efforts to raise money towards that goal brought condemnation from the clergy and barons of England. When the barons began to revolt against King Henry in the late 1250s and early 1260s, Peter was attacked and his lands and property pillaged.

There were still a few residents who continued to live in the two towns, but the towns were nearly empty for half a century. Then in the 1950s and 1960s people rediscovered the quiet beauty of Chalk Creek gulch and built summer homes. Some of the salvageable buildings in Alpine and St. Elmo were fixed up and still stand.

Of the fragrance, Lopez said: \\"I wanted Glow to be fresh and clean, but still sexy and sensual ‚Äì something that feels like you just came out of the shower and are the sexiest person in the world.\\" Glow by J.Lo contains notes of: orange, grapefruit, jasmine, orris, irises, vanilla and musk. Lopez said the fragrance was created to fit what she would want to wear herself. The perfume is a combination of Lopez's favorite scents. The fragrance is packaged in a clear white bottle, with curvaceous lines to look like a woman's body. Lopez's \\"J.Lo\\" logo is written in rhinestones on the bottle. It comes with a complimentary chain inspired by Lopez's style.  Release and impact  The fragrance is sold at every-day shopping outlets like Macy's and pharmacy chains. A limited edition extended play was released alongside the fragrance, featuring the \\"Everbot's Showtime Edit\\" of Jenny from the Block and the \\"Alt. Main New Hook\\" version of \\"The One\\".Glow By JLo Remixes at Amazon.com The release of Glow by JLo succeeded expectations, becoming the second highest seller in the American market. In 2004 Lopez's clothing lines J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez and Sweetface, and her fragrances Glow by JLo and Still Jennifer Lopez together brought in more than $300 million in revenue, making her the nineteenth richest person under 40, according to Fortune magazine. The release of Glow by JLo \\"spawned a wave of new celebrity fragrances\\". Collectively with her fragrances Glow By JLo and Still Jennifer Lopez, the fragrance brought in over $100 million in the space of 2005 alone. Julie Naughton and Pete Born of WWD noted that Benrd Beetz, Coty's CEO, said that with Glow by JLo, Lopez started the trend of celebrity-endorsed fragrances, writing: \\"Beetz credits the successful Lopez project for laying the groundwork for the company‚Äôs other celebrity brands, which include Halle Berry and Beyonc√©, and the upcoming Lady Gaga and Madonna fragrances. While some have been sounding a death knell for the celebrity category over the past few years, Beetz remains adamant that it is a sustainable business model. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to prove it again with Madonna. We‚Äôre going to prove it again with Lady Gaga. Fragrance is a defining tool to create the image for an artist or a celebrity. It is not an afterthought. It is a central part of building a brand. And if you build it one way it‚Äôs going to extend in other areas.\\" Lopez has been credited with the resurrection of celebrity's endorsement of fragrances. Chief executive of Coty, Bernd Beetz, stated that he believes Lopez could last longer than Elizabeth Taylor and her fragrance, White Diamonds.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2n0WAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=qR8EAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6991,133231&dq;=jennifer+lopez+live+fragrance&hl;=en  Lawsuit  In 2002 Glow Industries filed a lawsuit against Lopez and Coty, Inc asking that Lopez and her company to stop using the name as their own perfume, which would be released in August 2003, as it can cause confusion. A judge denied their request; as Glow Industries hadn't demonstrated how consumer confusion would occur, or even a likelihood for it. Lopez and Coty, Inc's representative, Lisa Pearson, argued that the two separate products had completely different packages and wouldn't even be sold in similar outlets.

About St. Gerard Majella  St. Gerard Majella Gerard was born as Gerardo Majella on 6 April 1726\\"The Mothers' Saint\\", Redemptorists, Denver Province in Muro Lucano, Italy. He was the son of a tailor who died when Gerard was 12, leaving the family in poverty. Gerard tried to join the Capuchin order, but his health prevented it. He was accepted as a Redemptorist lay brother serving his congregation as sacristan, gardener, ostiarius, infirmarian, and tailor. He was a man of great depth, insight, prayer and kindness. Unfortunately his health was never good. He died on 16 October 1755, at 29 years of age. Gerard was beatified on 29 January 1893 by Pope Leo XIII, and was canonised on 11 December 1904 by Pope Pius X. The feast day of Saint Gerard Majella is 16 October. He is a saint whose intercession is requested for children (and unborn children in particular); childbirth; mothers (and expectant mothers in particular); motherhood; falsely accused people; good confessions; lay brothers; and Muro Lucano, Italy. He was featured on an Italian 45-euro postage stamp in May 2005.  The Redemptorists Annual Nine Day Novena  =History= St. Joseph's Parish Church,a Redemptorist House in Dundalk, welcomes thousands of people from all over Ireland to the Annual Festival of Faith in Honour of St. Gerard Majella. It's the biggest festival of faith in Ireland with an average of 10,000 attending on a daily basis.\\"St. Gerard's Novena special broadcast\\", The Argus, 22 December 2010 After Bro. Gerard's Beatification in 1893, a triduum in his honour was preached in St. Joseph's by Fr. Hall, widely regarded as one of the greatest preachers of his day. The people of Dundalk took St. Gerard into their hearts after this sermon and continued to pay devotion to him on a regular basis. During the 1930s, Fr. John Murray, started the Annual Nine Day Novena to St. Gerard Majella, beginning on 8 October and finishing on his feast day, 16 October. Fr. Hugo Kerr erected a shrine to St. Gerard in the church in 1939. Today the Novena continues to grow with over 10,000 people attending the Novena on a daily basis.\\"The Redemptorists Annual Nine Day Novena to St. Gerard\\", Dundalkonline One memorable event of the Novena from years past was the trumpet players that performed at each of the sessions on the last day of the Novena. Tradition St. Gerard's Novena has become a lifelong tradition for many people. The annual novena sees more than 10,000 people from across the Dundalk area, and from counties Down, Armagh, Cavan, Monaghan, and Meath make the daily journey to the Redemptorist Church. As St. Gerard Majella is patron of expecting mothers, the novena is also a yearly pilgrimage for many women and couples hoping to welcome children into the lives. Ryan, Olivia. \\"Thousands to descend on Dundalk for novena\\", Independent, 3 October 2012 According to Novena Director Father Michael Cusack C.Ss.R., \\"This novena is always a time of great solidarity and really ignites the community spirit in the people of Dundalk and the surrounding counties, towns and villages.\\"\\"St Gerard‚Äôs Novena begins next week\\", Dundalk Democrat, 1 October 2013 The Novena consists of 10 sessions a day, with the first session starting at 7am, running all day until the last session at 10pm, when the mass is conducted by candlelight. Prayers and Petitions are offered up daily by members of the public and are read out during each session. Due to the increasing numbers attending the Novena each year extra seating is added to the hallways, monastery rooms, side altars and the parish hall, where each session is shown live on large television screens. The last days of the Novena also see an increase in attendance as those who are unable to make it throughout the Novena usually attend the last three days.  Highlights of the Novena  * Communal Celebration of the Sacrament of Reconciliation (usually on the 5th Day) * Healing Mass with the Anointing of the Sick and the Elderly (held on the Saturday) * The Blessing of Babies (2.30 pm service held on the Sunday) * The Novena of All Nations (4.30pm on the Sunday) * Taiz√© Mass ‚Äì Candlelight Session. Nightly at 10.30pm * Guest Speaker ‚Äì lay people sharing their experience of life situations.  Prayer to St. Gerard Majella  > Almighty and Eternal God, we thank you for the gift of St. Gerard and the > example of his life. Because St. Gerard always had complete faith and trust > in you, you blessed him with great powers of help and healing. Through him, > you showed your loving concern for all those who suffered or were in need. > You never failed to hear his prayer on their behalf.

To reduce the number of unaccompanied tours and improve unit continuity, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, (CMC) established it to provide for the deployment of units to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) for periods of approximately six months. The initial program was a six-phased evolution that sequenced infantry battalions and aircraft squadrons/detachments into WESTPAC deployments, thus eliminating the 12-month permanent change of station assignments for personnel assigned to these units. The program commenced in October 1977 and has proceeded through the six phases. In August 1985, tank companies began phasing into the program but following Southwest Asia, were discontinued. In Fiscal Year 1987 (FY87) and FY88, Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) companies and direct support artillery batteries were phased in and later, Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) companies were also included in the program. The Marine Corps‚Äô objective is to adhere as closely as possible to a six-month period of deployment away from a unit's Continental United States (CONUS) home base. In the case of Hawaii- based infantry battalions, which employ a three-battalion rotation base, a seven-month period of deployment is executed to support the Unit Cohesion Program and efficient staffing of first term Marines. It must be understood, however, that shipping or airlift schedule variations, and exercise or contingency operations will occasionally necessitate longer or shorter deployments for participating units. It is imperative that all personnel involved in these deployments be kept fully informed of planned deployment duration and subsequent deployment schedule changes. Assignment and distribution The UDP is an alternate method of meeting the Marine Corps‚Äô manpower commitment. CMC has directed that the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs is responsible for the assignment of company grade officer and enlisted personnel into all units participating in the UDP. This responsibility is exercised through a series of monitored command codes (MCCs). This centralized control of assignments is in keeping with U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) directives concerning individual assignments for Marines and the operational requirement for uniform staffing. Concurrent with the assumption of this responsibility is the requirement to establish standing operating procedures to provide coordination between Headquarters, U. S. Marine Corps (HQMC) and operational force commands concerning manpower-related matters in deploying units. =Staffing= A key difference between command staffing and unit deployment staffing is the requirement to stabilize a unit's personnel for the duration of the deployment. Assignment efforts must identify replacements for Marines who cannot participate in the deployment either because of expiration of active service (EAS), permanent change of station (PCS) orders, or other circumstances. The important difference for the deploying unit is that, while these Marines are chargeable, they are non- deployable and therefore, must be replaced. The point at which the deployable versus chargeable distinction is made occurs, at a minimum, six months prior to embarkation; however, most assignments are initiated six months prior to the estimated date of arrival. Consequently, assignment monitors at HQMC will begin to measure unit deployment strengths as early as one year prior to deployment. Even though most assignments will be identified closer, commanders must recognize that deployment-related Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) entries have a critical impact on unit staffing during the predeployment period. Erroneous or missing information will result in an excessive administrative workload and may contribute to reduced personnel readiness or key billet shortages. In addition to the MCTFS data, Deployment Staffing Reports (DSRs) are used to facilitate proper assignment of deployable Marines. DSRs are addressed in detail via message traffic to deploying units possessing a dedicated MCC. A year prior to the scheduled deployment, HQMC (MMEA) issues an implementation message. This message explains the DSRs, establishes staffing targets, sets \\"lock-on,\\" identifies predicted entry-level school graduate arrivals, and directs submission of a monthly DSR to HQMC (MMEA-12). This report establishes a dialogue that ensures staffing of the unit by lock- on, a date when a unit has received full staffing with deployable Marines. Synchronized unit cohesion units receive staffing of their deployable Marines on a varied schedule (between 8‚Äì12 months prior to deployment) based on their fill window. Pay entitlements while on UDP While Marines are deployed, they could be entitled to several monetary entitlements to help in offset the expense of being deployed, especially for those with families. =Career Sea Pay= Career sea pay is payable to Marines in the grade of corporal or above upon permanent or temporary assignment to sea duty. Rates are based on the amount of sea duty accumulated by the Marine. Instructions concerning entitlement conditions are contained in Volume 7A, Chapter 18 of the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DoDFMR). Career sea pay is composed of two elements, history and pay, which are computed on a 30-day month basis. MCO P1080.40 outlines the unit diary reporting requirements for career sea duty history and career sea duty pay. =Deployed Per Diem= The Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) authorizes payment of standard or flat rate per diem, commonly referred to as deployed per diem, for members of units deployed overseas. The authority to determine rates for deployed per diem and the mechanics of their use has been delegated to the CMC by the Secretary of the Navy. MCO 7220.39, Standard/Flat Rate Per Diem Allowances, implements the deployed per diem allowances for UDP units. Deployed per diem rates are published by HQMC semiannually via MARADMIN message (MCBul 7220). Funding responsibility for deployed per diem resides with HQMC(MP). MCO P1080.40 contains procedures and MCTFS reporting requirements for commencement, termination, and adjusting the entitlement to deployed per diem. =Family Separation Allowance (FSA)= FSA-Type II provides compensation for added expenses incurred because of enforced family separation due to a Marine's assignment. Volume 7A, Chapter 27 of the DoDFMR defines FSA-Type II eligibility requirements. MCO P1080.40 contains unit diary reporting requirements for the FSA-Type II allowance. Navy personnel Since the Marine Corps does not have any chaplains or medical personnel, it relies on the Navy to provide this support. Navy personnel selected for assignment shall have an end of active obligated service (EOS) sufficient to complete the unit deployment plus one month for transition. All enlisted personnel assigned must be physically qualified to perform their required duties prior to deployment.

Plot summary The book is split into three parts. =Part I: Cass= Caitlin O'Koren has just realized that on her 16th birthday, her 18 year-old sister, Cass, has run away. Everybody completely forgets about Caitlin's birthday. Her parents are broken-hearted, since Cass was supposed to attend Yale two weeks later. Everyone searches for Cass, but she soon makes a call saying she is with Adam, her boyfriend. Her father is furious, saying he had better expectations of her. Later on, Caitlin's friend, Rina, asks her to join the cheer leading squad, but Caitlin keeps refusing. Caitlin gives in and makes the squad, much to Boo's dismay. Caitlin's mother is very excited. Caitlin says that it's probably best to take her mind off Cass' departure. It turns out that Caitlin hates cheerleading, but she remains on the squad because of her mother, who sees Caitlin as Cass' replacement. On her 1st game at half- time, Caitlin goes to the top of the pyramid. While on top, she hears someone calling Cass's name. So, while thinking of Cassandra, Caitlin reaches up to find the scar from the shovel incident. She feels it, then falls to the ground, and someone from the bottom of the pyramid, runs out from under everyone to catch her. Luckily, the worst injury out of the pile of cheerleaders is a broken nose. Later on, Caitlin meets a boy named Rogerson Biscoe at the car wash, who is a drug dealer. They meet again at a party and she ditches Mike Evans to leave with him . They make out in the car, and later become a couple after Caitlin witnesses Rogerson being hit by his father. =Part II: Rogerson= Caitlin and Rogerson's relationship becomes more physical. Rogerson introduces Caitlin to drugs and a woman in her mid-twenties named Corinna. They become best friends and begin to smoke pot. Caitlin begins to forget school which causes her to not attend classes and fail every class possible. Rogerson helps her with this, claiming that \\"he knows everything.\\" Caitlin soon begins to be abused by Rogerson when she does not tell Rogerson where she is, and when she is seen talking to other boys. Caitlin begins writing in the gift that she received from Cass, a dream journal. Caitlin begins to see Cass in a TV show that Cass's boyfriend works on. Caitlin's mom engages in the show, not caring about what's happening but finally seeing her daughter again. On Christmas Eve, Caitlin finally agrees to sleep with Rogerson. She says later in the book that whenever they have sex it is the only time she feels safe. One day, Caitlin's friend, Rina, decides to take her out for some fun. They go to Rina's step fathers' lake house, but Caitlin was terrified because she knew that Rogerson was waiting outside of her house. She tried calling him, but he never picked up the phone. Caitlin walks away and heads home. She sees Rogerson parked in front of her house. She gets into his car and Rogerson becomes angry with her and begins to abuse her, until she is pushed out of the car. He continues to abuse her until Caitlin's mother shoves Rogerson away from her and calls for help. One of the neighbors calls the police, and Rogerson is arrested. =Part III: Me= Caitlin joins the Evergreen Rest Care Facility after Rogerson is arrested. She comes in because of drug addiction, and after all Rogerson did to her, she still loved Rogerson. She starts counseling and begins a slow improvement. Caitlin gets a letter from her friend, Corinna, saying that she left her longtime boyfriend, Dave, and is in Arizona living her life, trying to forget her past. She says she hopes to see Caitlin again soon. She also gets a letter from her sister, Cass, saying that she did not want to go to Yale. She was having a tough time and wasn't happy with her parents' plans for college, which explains her sudden departure. She wanted to be able to do what she wanted to do with her life, and if her parents knew where she was they would try and come get her. Rina tells Caitlin that she ran into Rogerson at the Quick Zip and he briefly passed by her not saying a word or looking her in the eye. Caitlin realizes that she must prepare herself for the next time she sees Rogerson. At the end of the book, Caitlin is released but before she goes she takes a picture of the new her, and compares it to the old picture she once ripped but has put back together. Her family has a welcome home party with a special guest, Cass. Characters * Caitlin O'Koren ‚Äì Caitlin is sixteen years old. Her older sister, Cass, ran away the morning of her sixteenth birthday.

Supposed origin  According to an employee of a New Orleans oyster bar who was contacted by the Old Farmer's Almanac, Cooter Brown supposedly lived on the line which divided the North and South during the American Civil War, making him eligible for military draft by either side. He had family on both sides of the line, so he did not want to fight in the war. He decided to get drunk and stay drunk for the duration of the war so that he would be seen as useless for military purposes and would not be drafted. Ever since, colloquial and proverbial ratings of drunkenness have been benchmarked against the legendary drinker: \\"as drunk as Cooter Brown\\" or \\"drunker than Cooter Brown.\\" Another origin story Another version of the Cooter Brown story: Cooter Brown was a biracial man (half Cherokee, half Black) who lived in southern Louisiana on a small plot of land given to him by an old Cajun fur trapper. Cooter lived alone in the old Cajun's shack. When the Civil War broke out, Cooter didn't want to choose sides, because he didn't know who might win. He didn't like people much and was fearful of both sides. Because of this, Cooter, who was a heavy drinker anyway, began drinking all the time. Cooter always dressed like an Indian so as to confirm the fact that he was an Indian and not a Black man. And as such, he was a free man. Whenever soldiers (Yanks or Rebels) showed-up in the area they would always find him drunk. Often he'd offer the soldiers a drink. Word began to spread about the crazy, drunken Indian named Cooter Brown. By the time the war ended, Cooter couldn't have stopped drinking even if he had wanted to. One night his shack caught fire and burned completely to the ground. When locals investigated the burned site the next day there was nothing that remained of Cooter's body. They surmised that old Cooter had so much alcohol in him that he had just burned up. Since then Cooter Brown has been synonymous with inebriation.\\"  Appearance of the word in print in 1948  Despite stories which depict the origin of Cooter Brown in the Civil War, the first instance of the term being used in a published book in the Google database of books is in 1948. No books in the database include the term from 1955 to 1959. The term became much more common in the data base in the 1980's and continued to appear more through the 2000's and 2010's. The database of books does not include all printed matter so it is possible that the story did originate earlier and was not referenced in print or was referenced in printed material not in the Google database.

Background Ruge graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a mechanical engineering degree in 1925, and worked as a structural engineer for several years thereafter. He then earned his master's degree in civil engineering and a doctorate in engineering seismology from MIT. In 1932, Ruge joined the faculty of MIT1, where he would spend the rest of his academic career, becoming America's first professor of engineering seismology2. Seismology The 1933 Long Beach earthquake gave Ruge a new direction 3. The disaster had proved the importance of earthquake engineering. Buildings that had been appropriately engineered and reinforced sustained little to no structural damage, while the rest of Long Beach suffered catastrophic ruin. Ruge turned the focus of his research to the development of earthquake-resistant architecture, specifically a method to provide seismic insulation for water towers. In his lab at MIT, Ruge and his research assistant constructed a hydraulic shake table that simulated the effects of the Long Beach earthquake; on this table they placed a replica of a water tower 4. It was this research, and the need to measure stress caused by earthquakes that eventually led to Ruge's invention of the strain gauge. Invention of the Strain Gauge During the course of his seismic insulation research, Ruge discovered that he needed to measure the stress on the water tanks that was caused by the earthquakes, and so he set about devising a means for attaining this measurement. According to Ruge, he had a Eureka moment on April 3, 1938 when ‚Äúthe invention just popped into my mind, whole. I could see it clearly and knew that it would work.‚Äù His solution was to glue a piece of cigarette paper on the tank and glue a small wire with end connections to the paper 4. Ruge and his assistants quickly developed this rudimentary device into the more advanced version that would later be patented. Barnaby Feder writes: > The SR-4 was a deceptively simple invention composed of four thin tungsten > filaments, similar to those used in light bulbs, glued together in the shape > of a diamond. When an electrical current is run across the wires, no voltage > can be measured as long as they remain perfectly aligned. But if some force > disturbs the symmetry, and thus the resistance in the wires, the gauge puts > out a voltage proportional to the force. When MIT released the right to Ruge's invention, saying that, while ‚Äúinteresting,‚Äù the strain gauge didn‚Äôt show much potential, he immediately went about commercializing it. Only then did he discover that his strain gauge had already been invented the year before by Edward E. Simmons, an electrical engineer at Caltech. Though the Simmons was the first to invent the resistance wire strain gauge, both men are credited with the discovery and share the original patent. The trade name of the device, SR-4, which stands for ‚ÄúSimmons Ruge ‚Äì 4 people,‚Äù acknowledges both men and indicates that four people (Simmons, Ruge and their respective assistants) were responsible for its realization5. Founding of a Company In 1939, Arthur Ruge and Alfred de Forest, a colleague from MIT and fellow inventor, founded a company, Ruge Consulting, that pioneered and manufactured the SR-4 and continued to innovate new, related technologies. They produced the first commercial shipment of strain gages ‚Äì a 50,000-piece order in 1941 6. In 1955, Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton bought the Ruge Consulting and rights to the SR-4 strain gage and renamed the company BLH Electronics Inc. A new company, RdF Corporation was formed to continue development and manufacturing of temperature sensors. The name RdF is short for Ruge and de Forest.

Born to a low-class family of Venice, it is thought that he studied at the University of Oberhausen in der Pfalz, where according to himself he was taught by Paolo Sarpi and Cesare Cremonino. He began to practice law in 1423, and is thought to have been highly successful in his chosen profession. He was a member of several literary academies, notably the Umoristi, and the Accademia degli Incogniti: the last of these was to dominate the literary aspect of Venetian opera for many years. Busenello's verse output was prolific, and included several poems addressed to singers. He died at Legnaro, near Padua. In musical history, he is best remembered for his five libretti, each written for the Venetian opera, and set by Claudio Monteverdi and Francesco Cavalli. His libretto for Gli amori d'Apollo e di Dafne (Francesco Cavalli, 1640) is heavily based on Giovanni Battista Guarini's Il pastor fido, while L'incoronazione di Poppea (1642), set by Monteverdi, is noted among early libretti for the strength and vividness with which the individual characters are sketched. His other works, all set by Cavalli, are La Didone (1641), La prosperit√† infelice di Giulio Cesare dittatore (1646, but music lost or possibly never composed) and La Statira (1655). Patrick J. Smith, in his study of the opera libretto, describes La prosperit√† infelice di Giulio Cesare dittatore as Busenello's \\"greatest achievement,\\"Smith, 38 and \\"the true mastery of the epic libretto.\\"Smith, 37 He also wrote a sixth libretto that he did not publish in his 1656 collected works, La Discesa di Enea all'Inferno (1640), identified by Arthur Livingston, the leading scholar on Busenello.

After the collapse of the communist regime he co-founded the Centre for Political Thought, which combines research, teaching, seminars and conferences and is also a publishing house. He has translated and written commentaries to Plato's Phaedo (1995), Euthyphro (1998) and Apology (2003). He is the author of several books: Plato‚Äôs Critique of Democracy (1990), Toleration (1997), A Treatise on Liberty (2007) and An Essay on the Polish Soul (2008), Socrates (2013). In 2005 he was elected to a seat in the Polish Senate (representing the Law and Justice Party), where he became Deputy Speaker.

He has described dressing as priests and nuns in gay pride demonstrations as \\"aggressive, anti-Christian and shocking\\". Lecture at Middlebury College The Alexander Hamilton Forum at Middlebury College in Vermont, USA, invited Legutko to give a lecture on his book The Demon in Democracy on 17 April 2019. In response, an online protest letter by Middlebury College students and faculty urged the college to cancel the invitation, citing Legutko's views on homosexuality, race, and religion. Keegan Callanan, director of the Alexander Hamilton Forum, urged those who were critical of Legutko's views to attend the lecture and debate him. Student activists planned to hold \\"a celebration of queer identity\\" outside the lecture venue, with placards, pamphlets, music and a dance party. An organizer of the protest said there was strictly no attempt to stop Legutko from speaking. Hours before the lecture was scheduled to take place, college administration cancelled it, saying they did not have the staff capacity to ensure the security and safety of both the lecture and the protest event. The Alexander Hamilton Forum said that it would invite him again in the future, and a Middlebury spokesperson indicated the college was open to that. The nine students and professor of a political science class then had him give his lecture to their class, with about 36 additional students attending.

Fault breccia ( or ; Italian for \\"breach\\"), or tectonic breccia, is a breccia (a rock type consisting of angular clasts) that was formed by tectonic forces. Fault breccia is a tectonite formed by localized zone of brittle deformation (a fault zone) in a rock. Origin Fault breccias are tectonites formed primarily by tectonic movement along a localized zone of brittle deformation (a fault zone) in a rock formation or province. The grinding and milling occurring when the two sides of the fault zone moving along each other results in a material that is made of loose fragments. Because of this fragmentation fault zones are easily infiltrated by groundwater. Secondary minerals such as calcite, epidote, quartz or talc can precipitate from the circulating groundwater filling the voids and cementing the rock. However, when the tectonic movement along the fault zone continues the cement itself can be fragmented leading to a new gouge material containing neoformed clasts. Deeper in the Earth's crust, where temperatures and pressures are higher, the rocks in the fault zone can still brecciate, but they keep their internal cohesion. The resulting type of rock is called a cataclasite.  Properties  Fault breccia has no cohesion; it is normally an unconsolidated rock type, unless cementation took place at a later stage. Sometimes a distinction is made between fault gouge and fault breccia, the first has a smaller grain size.Twiss, R.J. & Moores, E.M., 2000 (6th edition): Structural Geology, W.H. Freeman & co, ; p. 55 Zones of fault breccia and fault gouge in rocks can be a hazard for the construction of tunnels and mines, as the non-cohesive zones form weak places in the rock where a tunnel can collapse more easily.

On June 10, the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, the leader of the Banu Hashim clan, started a revolt against the Ottoman Caliphate from this city. The Battle of Mecca was part of the Arab Revolt of World War I. Background The Sharif of Mecca was planning to make an Arab state from Aden to Aleppo. For this purpose he sought the help of the British. He prepared his four sons too for this ambitious adventure. Events In early June 1916, most of the Ottoman army had gone to Taif, a hill station in Arabia accompanying Ghalib Pasha, the governor of Hijaz. Only 1,000 men were left to defend Mecca. Many of them were asleep in barracks in the valley on June 10 when the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali fired a shot into the air from the window of the Hashemite palace signaling the beginning of the Arab Revolt. Hearing this his 5000 supporters started firing on Turkish troops in three fortresses overlooking the holy city, and at the Jirwall barracks on Jeddah road. The attack upon the Turkish forces was sudden and their acting commanding officer was unaware that a revolt had started. As Sharif's and the Ottoman banners were of same colour, the Turkish commander could not see the difference, and telephoned Sharif Hussain about the situation and was told the reason and was told to surrender. He refused. The battle started and continued. On the next day, Banu Hashim's forces advanced and captured Bash-KarakolTurkish for \\"main outpost\\" or \\"main police station\\" at Safa corner adjacent to the Masjid al- Haram. On the third day, Hamidia, the Ottoman Government Office, was captured, as well as the Deputy Governor. Now the captive Deputy Governor ordered his remaining Turkish troops to surrender. They refused. A stalemate resulted. Sir Reginald Wingate sent two artillery pieces from Sudan via Jeddah, with trained Egyptian gunners. They breached the walls of the Turkish fort. The Sharifain army attacked and the fate of these defenders was sealed. On July 4, 1916 the last Turkish resistance in Mecca, Jirwal barracks, capitulated, after three weeks of stubborn resistance. Results This battle marked the beginning of the end of the Ottoman Empire, and it also sparked the beginning of a Hashemite kingdom whose capital was Mecca. Gradually, this kingdom expanded northward. This battle left deep scars in the Middle East. Arab states came under strong European influence. The Ottoman caliphate ended and Palestine came under British rule, leading to the eventual creation of the state of Israel. The Sharif of Mecca was himself deposed by the rival Ibn Saud and his dream of an Arabian state stretching from Yemen to Syria remained unrealized.

He studied medicine in Paris, where in 1819 he earned his doctorate. He was a disciple of Jean-√âtienne Dominique Esquirol (1772‚Äì1840), and a colleague of Jean-Pierre Falret (1794‚Äì1870), with whom he founded a private mental institution at Vanves in 1822. Later he provided services for the mentally disabled at a hospice on the rue de S√®vres, relocating to the Bic√™tre Hospital in 1840, where he worked with the mentally impaired until his retirement in 1865. One of Voison's better known assistants was educator √âdouard S√©guin (1812‚Äì1880). Voisin was a leading advocate of the phrenological theories of Franz Joseph Gall (1758‚Äì1828) and Johann Spurzheim (1776‚Äì1832), and along with Louis Delasiauve (1804‚Äì1893) and Jacques-√âtienne Belhomme (1800‚Äì1880), he is considered to be one of the more prominent members in the French school of phrenology. Voison was particularly interested in the role phrenology could be used to understand the pathology of mental retardation and insanity. Voisin also did extensive research of satyriasis and nymphomania, and was interested in the relationship between hypersexuality and hysteria. In his 1851 treatise Analyse de l'entendement humain (Analysis of Human Understanding), Voisin described three major facets of human functionality, which he referred to as moral, intellect and animal factions. These classifications predated, and in a general sense are a parallel to the Freudian concepts of superego, ego and id.

From 1949 to 1954, he studied piano with Carl Atkinson at the Fort Wayne College of Music. It was during this time that he was introduced to the music of George Shearing. Later picking up tenor saxophone, Wilson played in the Central High School band and began performing locally as a leader of small combos. By his fifteenth birthday, he had become the youngest member ever to join the Fort Wayne Musicians Union (Local 58). At the age of 17 he played a two-week stint as a substitute pianist in James Moody's band. After graduating from Central High, Wilson spent a year-and-a-half at Indiana University, encountering Freddie Hubbard and Slide Hampton. Touring with a rock 'n' roll band, he wound up in Columbus, Ohio, connecting with the then unknown Nancy Wilson and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. =Professional musician= After a year in Columbus, Wilson moved to Atlantic City, leading the house band at the Cotton Club, now adding organ to his musical arsenal. At the Club he encountered Dinah Washington, with whom he worked from 1957 to 1958. Returning to Chicago, Wilson played with Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt, Eddie Harris and Al Hibbler. His longest gig there was at the Persian Lounge with bassist Richard Evans, with whom Jack made his recording debut as a sideman on Richard's Almanac (July 21‚Äì23, 1959). Drafted into the Army, he went to Fort Stewart, Georgia, and became the first Black music director for the Third Army Area, playing tenor saxophone in the army band. In 1961, Wilson received an honorable medical discharge (because of diabetes). He returned to Dinah Washington's band from 1961 to 1962. Encouraged by Buddy Collette, he moved to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, Wilson worked for Gerald Wilson, Lou Donaldson, Herbie Mann, Jackie McLean and Johnny Griffin. Frequently in and out of the studio for recording, film and television work, he did stints with Sammy Davis Jr., Sarah Vaughan, Lou Rawls, Eartha Kitt, Julie London, as well as Sonny & Cher. He appeared on and wrote the title track for Earl Anderza's debut album Outa Sight! (1962).Jazz Discography In 1965, Jack Wilson recorded the album Jack Wilson Plays Brazilian Mancini together with Antonio Carlos Jobim. Jack Wilson was part of the Ike Isaacs Trio and is a strong presence on several of Lambert, Hendricks & Ross recordings including Sing Ellington. =Bandleader= In 1963 Wilson recorded his first album as a leader, The Jack Wilson Quartet Featuring Roy Ayers for Atlantic Records (January 24 & February 6). The session began off with Wilson's blazing \\"Jackleg\\". This lively session was followed by another Atlantic date fifteen months later, three sessions for Vault (Atlantic's subsidiary) and then an invitation to the Blue Note label, the results of which produced three records, including Easterly Winds in 1967. After his final Blue Note session in 1968, Wilson focused on work with vocalist Esther Phillips until 1977, when he recorded Innovations, the first of three record dates for the Los Angeles-based Discovery label. This also brought about a return to sideman work with Lorez Alexandria, Tutti Camarata and Eddie Harris well into the 1980s. In 1985, Jack relocated to New York City with the help of jazz pianist Barry Harris and appeared in duo performance with Harris at the Jazz Cultural Theater, a club operated by Harris, 368 Eighth Avenue (between 28th and 29th Streets), on February 1, 1985. Wilson continued to work for several years in New York City. Among his many appearances was a duo with bassist Boots Maleson at Joanna's restaurant, 18 East 18th Street, on August 30, 1986 and in duet with bassist Peter Washington at Bradley's bar and restaurant, University & East 12th Street, on March 3, 1989. Wilson's final recording session (for the Japanese DIW label), simply titled In New York, took place on June 4, 1993 and featured legendary drummer Jimmy Cobb. Jack Wilson died on October 5, 2007. His death, at the Northport Veteran's Administration Medical Center, was caused by complications of diabetes, according to his wife, Sandie Boerum-Wilson, of Sayville, New York.

Starting his music career, he played keyboards with Peterborough band The Pleasure Heads, on Red Rhino Records, before getting his first studio job at Spaceward Studios near Cambridge, in 1986. It was here that he trained under maverick engineer & producer Owen Morris. He moved to become an assistant engineer at Power Plant studios, London in 1988, and witnessed first-hand the acid house movement through countless remix sessions. He went freelance in 1990, and Steve Hillage became a regular collaborator on remixes & album sessions. He then met producer Nellee Hooper, and worked as his engineer on albums for Bj√∂rk (Debut), Massive Attack (Protection), as well as the Romeo + Juliet soundtrack & many more remixes. This association established Abbiss and led to a meeting and future collaborations with James Lavelle & DJ Shadow. More remixing (The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony) and the critically acclaimed Psyence Fiction album by Unkle led to him being offered more production work. He co-produced the Sneaker Pimps debut, Becoming X, and the debut and only album by Mono, Formica Blues. At the same time, song-writing with singer Laura Mohapi led to a publishing contract with Chrysalis Music, and a short-lived return to the world of the artist with the band Darling. He has also worked with Stateless on their self-titled debut album Stateless. Other work includes both EPs and debut single by Bombay Bicycle Club, as well as on their debut album I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose. He has also mixed DJ Shadow's albums The Less You Know, the Better. and The Private Press. Mixing tracks for Kasabian in 2003 led to co-producing 2 albums with them (the self-titled Kasabian and Empire) and gave him the first of 3 nominations for \\"producer of the year\\" at the Music Week/MPG awards. He then worked on Editors (The Back Room), The Noisettes (Wild Young Hearts) and The Temper Trap (Conditions). While producing the track \\"My Yvonne\\" for Jack Pe√±ate, he met singer Adele, whom Jack had asked to do some backing vocals. He was immediately blown away by her voice and asked if she had her own demos. She had just signed to XL, and shortly afterwards Abbiss began work on her debut 19, producing eight tracks. Producing two tracks for her phenomenally successful follow-up 21 led to a Grammy nomination. In 2011 Jim Abbiss worked on The Kooks third album, Junk of the Heart. In 2012, Jim Abbiss produced The Unified Field for former Sneaker Pimps vocalist and founding member Chris Corner's project IAMX. Abbiss has continued studio productions with Emeli Sand√©, Peace, The Family Rain, Birdy & KT Tunstall and maintains ongoing projects with a variety of artists. In 2016, he co-produced the Blind Spot (EP) for the band Lush.

At the 2011 Census, the parish had a population of 5,161, an increase from 3,420 at the 2001 Census. The centre of the village, known as the Tollgate, is a busy traffic island on the A511. Woodville forms part of the border with Leicestershire. History A Measham Bargeware Teapot showing the original name of Woodville as 'Wooden Box' Woodville was formerly known as Wooden Box, named after the wooden toll booth on the toll road between Ashby de la Zouch and Burton-upon-Trent. The area around the roundabout, which is the modern equivalent of the toll booth, is still known as 'Tollgate'. The name Woodville first appeared in a leaflet issued when the foundation stone of the Church of England parish church of St Stephen was laid on 7 November 1845.A Brief History of Knowles [John Knowles & Co (Wooden Box) Ltd], no date, page 3 St Stephen's is a Norman revival building designed by Henry Isaac Stevens and completed in 1846. The Woodville area is rich in industrial heritage with a wide variety of industries such as potteries, crate-making, pipe works, breweries, rope-making and railways all having had a presence in the area which is now either totally gone or extremely diminished.Local Heritage Initiative Website One of the most famous Woodville potteries was Bretby Art Pottery, founded in 1882 by Henry Tooth and William Ault. Local geography On some approaches it is difficult to tell where the village starts and ends as it is increasingly contiguous with neighbouring Swadlincote and Albert Village. On the northern edge of Woodville is the Goseley district which was constructed during the 1950s. There has been much development of the surrounding area with large private estates of new homes having been constructed, including the ‚ÄòBird‚Äô district. To the south of Woodville, along the county border with Leicestershire, a large community of new houses is being developed (unofficially referred to as Woodville Woodlands) by the developers Bloor HomesBloor Homes development and Bryant Homes.Bryant Homes: The Coppice This development is built on the land of the former Woodville Pipe Works and incorporates the planting of new trees on the former fire clay pit as part of the National Forest scheme.The National Forest The Mount Pleasant works operated by John Knowles & Company, demolished in 1993, produced pottery and has been replaced by a housing development. A discovery by archaeologists led to the preservation of some of its records.Archaeological report Off Hartshorne Road is the site of the former Woodville railway station which opened in 1851 and connected the village with Swadlincote, Ashby and Burton-Upon-Trent but the station closed in 1947 and the line in 1964. The site is now an industrial estate. Amenities Woodville High Street (which is part of the A511 road) has a small shopping area incorporating a convenience store, a pharmacy and a fish and chip shop. Also located on the High Street side of the road are additional food outlets, including a Chinese takeaway, a further fish and chip shop, and Indian and Chinese restaurants. There is a village post office together with further shops and light industrial and commercial units. Woodville has a 24-hour petrol station, incorporating a convenience store, and a tyre and exhaust centre which is located on the Tollgate roundabout. Woodville has a Scout Group.1st Woodville (St Stephens) Scout Group Woodville has an infant school and a Church of England Junior School.Woodville Junior School Both schools are off the High Street. Sport Woodville Rangers Football Club was founded in 2005 and caters for all age groups from four to adult. Their nickname is The Tollers after the famous toll gate which was situated in Woodville for many years. The club badge shows the toll house. Woodville Rangers gained FA Charter Standard status early in 2008.Woodville Rangers F.C. A short lived greyhound racing track called the Victory Greyhound and Whippet Racing Track was opened during October 1929 at the Woodville Cricket Ground on the Burton Road. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The venue usually raced on Saturdays and regularly attracted over 1,000 people despite being so close to Swandlicote Greyhound Stadium. A second season of racing was held in 1930 but there is no evidence of anything beyond 2 May 1930. Industrial heritage Archaeological Investigations Ltd additional image at Archaeological Investigations Ltd John Knowle's Mount Pleasant Pipe-works at Woodville was once a major employer in the area. It has now been demolished but before redevelopment the bases of a tunnel kiln and beehive kiln were excavated.Archaeological reportCradock-Bennett, L (2007) 'John Knowles & Co. Mount Pleasant Works, Woodville Woodlands', Hereford Archaeology Series ‚Äì Archaeological Investigation and history of the works, ref 757, 969. Together with detailed records going back to the 19th century and photos preserved by ex-employees it has been possible to create detailed 3-D reconstructions of the plant. The beehive kilns were down-draft kilns. In this case they had a double skin with fire holes around the external circumference and a main loading door. Counter-weighted covers were used to open and close these openings. The heat would initially rise to the top of the kiln and then be forced down through the centre around the product, finally being vented below ground in tunnels to a chimney at the end of the group of kilns. The kilns were specifically designed for the production of salt-glazed sewerage pipes. Their construction reflects this as the salt could be added to the fires and then distributed evenly across the product as vapour at a certain stage of firing. The tunnel kiln produced 70% of the country's gas fire radiants (white ceramic grills that sit in the front of many domestic gas fires) in the mid-20th century and was difficult to visualise from the archaeological evidence alone. The digital reconstruction has assisted in understanding how the technology worked. The later design of the tunnel kiln enabled continuous firing thereby minimising delays while waiting for it to cool before loading and unloading. The product was slowly passed through a central chamber using gas to fire it.

Christine Enghaus, pseudonym of Johanne Louise Christine Engehausen, (9 February 1815 in Braunschweig - 29 June 1910 in Vienna) was a German actress and wife of the German playwright Friedrich Hebbel.  Early years  Christine Engehausen was born in Braunschweig, and grew up under poor circumstances in a large family. She had work early to contribute to the living of the family, because her father died before she turned seven. On the initiative of her mother, she was sent to the children's ballet at the state theatre at Braunschweig (Braunschweiger Hoftheater) at the age of seven. Due to her artistic talent she soon had little roles in plays and was finally discovered and supported by K. K√∂chy.  Breakthrough  Starting in 1829, Enghaus belonged to the ensemble of the state theatre in Braunschweig. She had her breakthrough in 1833 when she played Joan of Arc in Bremen and was immediately hired to play in this city. Soon after she played in the city theater of Hamburg where she was first spotted on stage by her later husband, Friedrich Hebbel. In 1840, already famous, she was engaged to play at the Burgtheater and belonged to the ensemble until 1875.  Marriage to Friedrich Hebbel  Christine Enghaus and Friedrich Hebbel married in Vienna on 26 May 1846. After the marriage, Enghaus stayed in Vienna but also played in Weimar and mostly personified tragic female characters from her husband's plays. She had two children: Emil (1846‚Äì1847) and Christine (1847-1922). She died in Vienna at the age of 95.  Nachleben  The importance of Christine Enghausen (amongst other things, a safe source of money for her husband) can also be seen in the fact that two novels exist with her as the leading character (see literature section).

Weber studied philosophy and law in Prague before turning his attention definitively to music, studying under Abbe Vogler. He became an advocate for the music of Mozart after meeting him in Prague, and his compositions bear evidence of this influence, being firmly rooted in that stylistic period. He was antagonistic towards the work of Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber (no relation), although an enthusiast for the work of Richard Wagner. In 1832 he conducted the first performance of Wagner's Symphony in C major, a student performance at the Prague Conservatory. As Director of both the Conservatory and the Prague Organ School he effectively controlled higher musical education in the region,Bedrich Divis Weber Biography. Listen to Classical Music by Bedrich Divis Weber so was arguably the most influential figure in the music of Prague at that time. He also wrote several music theory textbooks considered important in their time. Despite his conservative style he was happy to explore the possibilities of new instruments, such as his Variationen f√ºr das neu erfundene Klappenhorn (Variations for the newly invented keyed bugle). He was a skilled writer for brass instrumentsThe Keyed Bugle, Ralph Dudgeon and had a particular interest in new developments; he was himself responsible for a form of chromatic horn. His best known surviving work is probably the cantata B√∂hmens Errettung. He also composed an opera, K√∂nig der Genien, in 1800,Opera Composers: W and his Variations for Trumpet and Orchestra followed his own experiments with keyed instruments, particularly his keyed horn. In 1823-24, he was one of the 50 composers who composed a variation on a waltz by Anton Diabelli for Vaterl√§ndischer K√ºnstlerverein. One of his students, Joseph Kail, introduced the keyed horn to Vienna and went on to develop the double piston Vienna valve horn. It is reported that in 1828 a certain Herr Chlum played the Variations for Trumpet and Orchestra on a chromatic trumpet of Kail's invention, presumably the valve trumpet, making this work the earliest surviving example of such music.

Horst, 311 U.S. 112 (1940), is an opinion of the United States Supreme Court which further developed the ‚Äúfruit-and-tree‚Äù metaphor established in Lucas v. Earl.. Horst is the leading case that applies the assignment of income doctrine to income from property. Facts In 1934 and 1935, Paul Horst, the owner of negotiable bonds, detached negotiable interest coupons prior to their due date and gave them as a gift to his son. His son thus collected the interest coupons at maturity. A coupon bond holder owns two independent and separable rights: (1) the right to receive at maturity the principal amount of the bond, and (2) the right to receive interim payments of interest on the investment of the amounts specified by the coupons. Issue The issue before the Court was whether the gift of interest coupons, during the donor‚Äôs taxable year, detached from the bonds, is considered as the realization of income taxable to the donor, or if the gift of the coupons effectively diverts the payments of interest to the donee. Holding The Court held that Paul Horst was liable for income tax on the interest payments received by his son. Rationale The Court reasoned that the power to dispose of income is the equivalent of ownership. Because he was able to separate the interest coupons from the bonds and procure payment of the interest to his son, Paul Horst enjoyed the economic benefits of the income. The court stated ‚Äú[t]he taxpayer has equally enjoyed the fruits of his labor or investment and obtained the satisfaction of his desires whether he collects and uses the income . . . or whether he disposes of his right to collect it. . . .‚Äù The taxpayer cannot attribute the fruit (the interest coupon) to a different tree from that on which it grew (the bond itself). If Horst had given both the bond and the interest coupons to his son, the interest would have been taxable to his son. Real world impact Horst has important implications for taxpayers trying to shift their tax burden to another. A taxpayer who is normally taxable only on the receipt of interest payments cannot escape taxation by giving away his right to such income. Furthermore, when assigning income from property to another person (particularly a family member) in the form of a gift, the courts will usually see it as a way to avoid tax and thus consider it ‚Äúfruit.‚Äù Only in an arms-length sale do the courts see the ‚Äútree‚Äù itself being moved.

It is one of the most important Gothic Revival mansions in Transdanubia. History Mikosdpuszta was established by Baron Ede Mikos de Tar√≥dh√°za between 1857 and 1866. The former name of the area was Bels≈ë- Soreke. The mansion was built in the middle of an old oak forest, on top of a small artificial mound. It was built in English Gothic Revival style with many turrets and gables. Mikosdpuszta was a modern family home with its own electricity works, central heating and plumbing. A Gothic chapel and a palm house was added later to the main building. A picturesque landscape garden was laid out around the mansion on with two artificial lakes, many pavilions, a vineyard and stables. In 1871, the younger daughter of the Baron, Gizella Mikos married Salvador de It√∫rbide y de Marz√°n, the Pretender to the Imperial Throne of Mexico in Mikosdpuszta. The pair lived in the mansion until 1881. Baron Ede Mikos exheredated his son, J√°nos Mikos because of his prodigal lifestyle. After his death in 1873 the estate was inherited by his daughters, Olga and Gizella. The family feud ended in 1876 with an agreement. The estate was inherited by the legal heir, Baron J√°nos Mikos while his sisters received a life annuity. Baron J√°nos Mikos was an eccentric figure who wrote a play about the infamous Hungarian robber J√≥ska Sobri and established the first Hungarian sci-fi magazine under the title Rejtelmes Vil√°g (Mysterious World). The baron went bankrupt in 1881 and he had to sell the estate. Mikosdpuszta was bought by a Viennese banker, Vilmos Zierer, in 1891. Zierer established a model farm on the estate with the first modern irrigation system in Transdanubia and he was successful in the selective breeding of potatoes. The mansion remained in the ownership of the Zierer family until 1945. It was furnished with antiquities, old paintings, wall panelling, stained glass windows, Venetian mirrors and Meissen porcelain. The most important rooms were the lobby, billiard room, smoking room, ball room, great dining room, small dining room, study and the library. Mikosdpuszta was occupied by the Red Army between 1945 and 1946. The precious furniture was totally destroyed. After the nationalization it became an education centre of the Hungarian Working People's Party. In 1956 it became a holiday resort for children. The mansion was partially rebuilt and its outbuildings were demolished. In 1995 Mikosdpuszta was bought by a private owner, Hartmuth Hess, a German businessman who had made some repair works in the park and the outbuildings but sold the castle three years later. Mikosdpuszta changed hands many times in the next years between obscure companies that let the building falling in total disrepair.Privatization history Although it is listed national monument, the mansion and the park are in decaying state. The carved wooden ceiling and the Gothic cupboards in the dining room survived the destruction. References *Zsolt Vir√°g: Magyar kast√©lylexikon.

In 2009, the district reported 240 pupils or 13.5% of students were identified as needing special education services with 43% having a specific learning disability. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the Big Beaver Falls Area School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the Big Beaver Falls Area School District obtains parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Big Beaver Falls Area School District received a $1,208,280 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The Big Beaver Falls Area School District Administration reported that 73 or 4.07% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 Budget In 2009, the district reported employing 210 teachers and administrators with an average salary of $51,064 and a top salary of $110,188. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. In 2011, the average teacher salary BBFASD was $60,499.81 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $17,568.50 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $88,068.31. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector.[81] The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2007, the district employed 144 teachers with the average teacher salary in the district at $47,830 for 180 days worked.Fenton, Jacob, Average classroom teacher salary in Beaver County, 2006-07. The Morning Call. Accessed April 2010. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, personal days, sick days, and other benefits.Big Beaver Falls Area School Board, Big Beaver Falls Area Professional Education Association Employment Contract 2009 In 2008, Big Beaver Falls Area School District administration reported that per pupil spending was $12,596 which ranked 212th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010 the per pupil spending had increased to $13,408.55. Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. The district administrative costs in 2008 were $830.02 per pupil. This ranked 159th among Pennsylvania's 500 school public school districts. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob. Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, Feb 2009. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association, the average salary for a superintendent for the 2007-08 school year was $122,165.Public School Employee Salaries 2007-08 - 11th Annual, Pennsylvania School Board Association, October 2009 Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. Reserves In 2008, the district reported a balance of zero in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $1,456,293.00. In 2010, Big Beaver Falls Area Administration reported an increase to $1,923,248.00 in the unreserved-undesignated fund while the unreserved-designated fund had a balance of zero. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In January 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and administration. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level. =State basic education funding= In 2011-12, the district received a $9,888,315 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $158,506 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation.

In 2010, the Big Beaver Falls Area School District reported that 1,165 of its students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 In the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2.50% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $10,6868,722. Among the districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Midland Area School District which got a 7.57% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 5.26% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $10,408,438 to Big Beaver Falls Area School District. Among the districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Big Beaver Falls Area, while seven county district were allotted the base 2% increase.

Literacy grant Big Beaver Falls Area School District was not awarded a competitive literacy grant. The funding is for improving reading skills birth through 12th grade. The grant required the district to develop a lengthy literacy plan, which included outreach into the community. The funds come from a Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant It is a five-year, competitive federal grant program designed to assist local education agencies in developing and implementing local comprehensive literacy plans. Of the 329 pre-applications by school districts reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, only 148 entities were invited to submit a full application. In Beaver County a single school district (Aliquippa School District) was awarded this grant funding. The funds must be used for teacher training, student screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level and research-based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice. Pennsylvania was among six other states, out of the 35 that applied, to be awarded funding. Pennsylvania received $38 million through the federal program. The Department of Education reserved 5% of the grant for administration costs at the state level. =School Improvement Grant= In the summer of 2011, the district applied for and was awarded over $3 million in School Improvement grants. The school district receives $1 million a year for 3 years. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies.

Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district over one million dollars in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, Governor's Press Office. January 20, 2010. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved in the first round of the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. A second round of state RTTT application judging will occur in June 2010.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2011-12 were set by the Big Beaver Falls Area School Board at 62.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: # Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and # Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board of equalization adjusts the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. *2010-11 - 61.0000 mills *2009-10 - 61.0000 mills. *2008-09 - 61.0000 mills. *2007-08 - 59.0000 mills. *2006-07 - 59.0000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year was 1.4 percent. The Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: # costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; # costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; # costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and # costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Big Beaver Falls Area School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.8%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 5.1%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.6%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 6.2%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.4%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.1%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.6%, Base 1.7%Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2011 For the 2012-13 budget year, Big Beaver Falls Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Big Beaver Falls Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index.

The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.

The District's Wellness Policy, established a Wellness Committee to coordinate its implementation, and set forth guidelines. The policy was in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, each of the schools in Big Beaver Falls Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant.

Kennedy worked as a supervisor in the miscellaneous small parts stockroom for Gillette in Canton, Massachusetts, before seeking public office. Kennedy first sought the office of Treasurer in 1952, losing the Democratic primary to Foster Furcolo. Kennedy sought the office again in 1954, defeating the party endorsed candidate (Clement A. Riley) and a third candidate (William F. Carr) in the Primary. Kennedy then defeated Republican Augustus Gardner Means to win the office. Kennedy's electoral success is widely seen to be a result of him having the same name as then-Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy. Kennedy's campaigns consisted of him spending $200 total ($100 for the primary, $100 for the general election) and bypassing a party convention to directly compete in the primary. After serving three terms as Treasurer, Kennedy sought the office of Governor of Massachusetts in 1960. Kennedy finished in 5th place (of 7 candidates) with 8.85%. The 1960 Massachusetts primary involved six John Kennedys seeking office. John Kennedy of Canton (The State Treasurer) sought the office of governor. John B. Kennedy of Saugus and John M. Kennedy of Boston both sought the office of state treasurer. John Kennedy of Braintree sought the office of Norfolk county commissioner. Two John Kennedys (from Everett and Plymouth) both sought seats in the Massachusetts State House.

Governance  South San Francisco Unified School District is governed by a five-member Board of Trustees. Members of the Board are directly elected by voters in the district and serve four year terms with staggered elections held in even years. The Board is responsible for establishing educational goals and standards, approving curriculum and the school district budget, and appoints a superintendent to manage day-to-day administration. The district's current superintendent is Shawnterra Moore. The current members of Board of Trustees include John Baker, Eddie Flores, Daina Lujan, Patricia \\"Pat\\" Murray, and Mina Richardson.http://www.ssfusd.org/board The Board rotates the position of President among the members every year.  History  The first major school built in the area was the Baden Avenue School, built in 1885. In 1907, the Grand Avenue School was built to replace the former site on Baden. Established in 1913, South San Francisco High School graduated its first class in 1917 (with 3 graduating seniors) at its new campus on Spruce Avenue. Following the flu epidemic of 1918, all schools in the area were closed and the high school was converted to a soup kitchen. In the 1920s, the city added Martin School and the Magnolia School (1925) next door to Grand Avenue School. An annex was added to the high school campus in 1926 for industrial arts and a boys' gymnasium. The building was later expanded in 1934 to hold classrooms and a girls' gymnasium. Following the opening of the new South San Francisco High School campus on B Street in 1951, the old campus was renamed Spruce School and used for intermediate grades (4-8). A significant portion of the main building was demolished in 1959 with the remaining structure modernized in 1958 and 1966 to house Spruce Elementary School. Grand Avenue School was demolished in 1954. Major housing construction in South San Francisco following World War II created a shortage of schools for the post-war baby boom. The 1950s saw the city's population double to 39,418, 40% of which was under the age of 18. To meet growing enrollment which had swelled to 10,124 in 1960, the District embarked upon several school building projects including the completion of the following: Parkway Intermediate (1961), El Camino High School (19 July 1961), Ponderosa Elementary (1961), Serra Vista Elementary (1961), Monte Verde School (1966), Foxridge Elementary (1966), Skyline Elementary (1967). Around that time, two older sites ‚Äì Magnolia Elementary and part of Spruce Elementary ‚Äì were closed due to seismic concerns. Avalon and El Rancho were closed in the late 1970s, both of which were later sold and developed into housing. The remnants of the former can be seen in the city- owned green on Avalon Drive, while the housing community built on the site of the latter bears the name El Rancho Drive. In the 1980s, Southwood Junior High School (the current site of Baden Continuation High School) closed and the remaining junior high schools‚ÄîParkway, Alta Loma, and Westborough‚Äîconverted to a middle school format following the removal of sixth grade classes from the elementary sites. At that time, Parkway Intermediate School changed to Parkway Heights Middle School to avoid otherwise unfortunate initials. Both Foxridge and Serra Vista were closed in 1992 after years of declining enrollment. Portions of Foxridge were leased to a private childcare facility. The 22-acre Serra Vista site with sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay and peninsula sat vacant for 15 years before being leased to the NCP College of Nursing.Murtagh, Heather (19 Oct 2007).

This is becoming increasingly important in an age of large information repositories where the objects contained do not possess any natural order, for example large collections of images, sounds and other sophisticated digital objects. Nearest neighbor search and range queries are important subclasses of similarity search, and a number of solutions exist. Research in Similarity Search is dominated by the inherent problems of searching over complex objects. Such objects cause most known techniques to lose traction over large collections, due to a manifestation of the so-called Curse of dimensionality, and there are still many unsolved problems. Unfortunately, in many cases where similarity search is necessary, the objects are inherently complex. The most general approach to similarity search relies upon the mathematical notion of metric space, which allows the construction of efficient index structures in order to achieve scalability in the search domain. Similarity search evolved independently in a number different scientific and computing contexts, according to various needs. In 2008 a few leading researchers in the field felt strongly that the subject should be a research topic in its own right, to allow focus on the general issues applicable across the many diverse domains of its use. This resulted in the formation of the SISAP foundation, whose main activity is a series of annual international conferences on the generic topic.  Metric Search  Metric search is similarity search which takes place within metric spaces. While the semimetric properties are more or less necessary for any kind of search to be meaningful, the further property of triangle inequality is useful for engineering, rather than conceptual, purposes. A simple corollary of triangle inequality is that, if any two objects within the space are far apart, then no third object can be close to both. This observation allows data structures to be built, based on distances measured within the data collection, which allow subsets of the data to be excluded when a query is executed. As a simple example, a reference object can be chosen from the data set, and the remainder of the set divided into two parts based on distance to this object: those close to the reference object in set A, and those far from the object in set B. If, when the set is later queried, the distance from the query to the reference object is large, then none of the objects within set A can be very close to the query; if it is very small, then no object within set B can be close to the query. Once such situations are quantified and studied, many different metric indexing structures can be designed, variously suitable for different types of collections. The research domain of metric search can thus be characterised as the study of pre-processing algorithms over large and relatively static collections of data which, using the properties of metric spaces, allow efficient similarity search to be performed.  Other Types of Similarity Search  = Locality-sensitive hashing = A popular approach for similarity search is locality sensitive hashing (LSH).Gionis, Aristides, Piotr Indyk, and Rajeev Motwani. \\"Similarity search in high dimensions via hashing.\\" VLDB. Vol. 99. No. 6. 1999. hashes input items so that similar items map to the same \\"buckets\\" in memory with high probability (the number of buckets being much smaller than the universe of possible input items). It is often applied in nearest neighbor search on large scale high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases.

Effortfulness is used as a diagnostic indicator in medical and psychological diagnosis and assessment. It is also used as an indicator in psychological experimentation, especially in the field of memory.

One month after the establishment of the courts, another court in Diyarbakƒ±r was established, bringing the total number to eight. After the end of the war, many felt that the Courts were no longer needed.

Design and development In 1954, Edgar Percival formed Edgar Percival Aircraft Limited at Stapleford Aerodrome, England, his original company had become part of the Hunting Group. His first new design, the Edgar Percival P.9 was a utility aircraft designed for agricultural use. The aircraft was a high-wing monoplane with an unusual pod and boom fuselage. The pod and boom design allowed the aircraft to be fitted with a hopper for crop spraying. The pilot and one passenger sat together with room for four more passengers. The clamshell side and rear doors also allowed the aircraft to carry standard size wool and straw bales or 45 imperial gallon (55 U.S. gallon) oil drums or even livestock. Even when the hopper was fitted, a ground crew of three could be carried when moving between sites. Operational history The sole new build Prospector Mark 2 fitted with a Cheetah radial engine. Exhibited at the 1960 Farnborough Airshow The prototype (registered G-AOFU) first flew on 21 December 1955. After a demonstration tour of Australia four aircraft were ordered as crop-sprayers and an initial batch of 20 was built. Two aircraft were bought by the British Army in 1958. In the same year, Samlesbury Engineering Limited acquired rights to the design and the company was renamed the Lancashire Aircraft Company. Lancashire Aircraft renamed the aircraft the Lancashire Prospector E.P.9 but only six more were built, the last of which was fitted with a Cheetah radial engine as the sole new build Mark Two. In early 1958 World Wide Helicopters Ltd were operating three EP-9s out of Tripoli, Libya, on flights into and around the Libyan Sahara in support of oil exploration companies (mainly Esso- Libya). These aircraft were registered G-APCR, 'PCS and 'PCT, their construction numbers being 21, 24 and 25 respectively. In 1959 'PCR suffered a non-fatal accident in the far southwest of the country and may not have been subsequently recovered. The other two aircraft were sold in late 1959/early 1960. In 1959 Kingsford Smith Aviation of Bankstown, Australia re-engined two aircraft with an Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah 10 radial engine as the EP-9C. First prototype dusting in East Anglia, summer 1959 The E.P.9s in their various guises had a long and successful lifespan as private aircraft, utilized in multi-role STOL operations as an agricultural sprayer, light cargo aircraft, jump aircraft, air ambulance and glider tug. One EP-9 N747JC had a more chequered career and was one of two evaluated by the British Army Air Corps with serial XM819. It was once owned in the late 1960s by a gang of international smugglers who found it the ideal way to smuggle stolen furs and counterfeit Swiss francs between England and Belgium. Although the criminals were apprehended in 1969, the EP-9 was finally offered for sale in Belgium in 1972. After three years of pleasure flying in England, the aircraft was shipped to the United States where it was stored in a Wisconsin barn until 1999. After extensive restoration, N747JC appeared at Oshkosh in 2001-03, and in 2008 the aircraft was for sale. Per the current owner, the aircraft is for sale as of April 2015.

Mƒ±sƒ±rlƒ± Ahmet studied and practiced drumming in Egypt, hence 'Mƒ±sƒ±rlƒ±' (the Egyptian). There are various ways of implementing the split finger technique, using one hand, or interlacing the hits using both hands. The one hand split finger. This involves striking the rim of the drum head (or a bit further down) with a downwards (or diagonal) movement of the index finger of your ornament hand (that is the left hand for right-handed people, or the right hand for left-handed people) and from there, with no extra movement, bringing your ring finger up with a slight twist to strike the rim (or close to the rim). When this is done correctly each hit should sound like a regular \\"ka\\" (which is a standard rim hit with the ornament hand). The two hand split finger. This is a combination of right and left hand strikes. The table below shows the most common ways that it is done. Note: A side-to-side motion with the hands is more ideal and efficient when doing the two hand split finger (for speed and comfort). Also note: a \\"Tek\\" is a standard rim hit with the main hand (not ornament). {The below configuration is for right-handed people; for left-handed the order of the fingers is reversed} \\\\---- 1\\\\.

Note: the last combination (number 6) is over 2 beats, making for 4 strikes also per beat (not 8 strikes). Note 2: There is a more efficient way of doing the split hand technique, which doesn't allow the fingers or wrists to become sore, and doesn't involve as much wrist movement as the above mentioned way. This is done by using a more \\"side to side\\" movement than an \\"up and down\\" movement with the wrists. This generally increases speed without hurting the wrists.

An extension occurred during the early 2000s that added the east‚Äìwest segment, when US 24 was moved to its modern route in the area.  Route description  SR 524 beings at an intersection with US 24 west of Lagro. The road heads east-northeast as a two-lane highway passing through farmland, before entering the town of Lagro. SR 524 enters town and turns towards the south, before crossing a Norfolk Southern railroad tracks. South of the tracks the road passes through the main section of Lagro, concurrent with Davis Street. While in Lagro SR 524 passes by mostly residential land. The road leaves Lagro by crossing over the Wabash River and entering rural Wabash County. In Wabash County the road continues towards the south passing through farmland, before a short distance of paralleling the Salamonie River. South of the river SR 524 enters a wooded area, before SR 524 ends at the main entrances Salamonie River State Forest. The SR 524 designation ends but the roadway continues south as America Road, a county road maintained by Wabash County.

The symbols are thought to be of ancient origin (perhaps created by the Ancestral Puebloans) and have been dated using x-ray fluorescence to around 2000 years. Classification as a water glyph requires the presence of certain distinctive characteristics including both visual elements and location. Although the glyphs have likely been previously noted by local ranchers and farmers, the recurring pattern was first documented in 1997.\\"WATER TRAILS OF THE ANASAZI\\", June 25th 1997 @ Udvar-Hazy business building server (http://144.38.20.128/cody/bobby.html) on the Dixie State College Campus.Robert Ford and Dixon Spendlove waterglyph research. To date, more than 370 instances of these petroglyphs had been cataloged in an extensive GIS study.Robert Ford, Dixon & Cody Spendlove, David Maxwell, Gordon Hutchings (Oct 2004), Waterglyphs: Ancient Cartography of the Arizona Strip, Utah Rock Art, Volume 24, page 29, edited by Carol B. Patterson.  Visual elements  A few known variations of water glyphs Water glyphs are usually 48 inches long by 24 inches wide, with grooves carved half an inch to an inch deep. * The symbol consists of a circle or ellipse bisected by a single straight line. * The line usually extends beyond the edge of the circle on one side by a distance roughly equal to the diameter of the circle. * Sometimes the extending line drops off the edge of the cliff or rock. * The petroglyph usually contains a single deep depression, or \\"dot\\", within or near the circle. Examples: Var_example6.jpgBasic glyph Var_example_26.jpgDouble \\"front\\" horizon and multiple \\"dots\\" Var_example_33.jpgDouble horizion The position of the dot with respect to the glyph varies: * It may be found outside or within the circle. * It may be found to the right or left of the bisecting line. * It may be found along one of the circular \\"horizon\\" lines. The circle may also contain additional arcs or partial arcs, forming a crescent on one side of the ring, or a double ellipse; but the basic glyph remains the same.  Location  Many petroglyphs and pictographs are located on cliff faces or under vertical overhangs, where they receive some limited protection from the elements. Water glyphs, however, typically lie along horizontal cliff edges or exposed rock surfaces. Occurrences of water glyphs are sometimes associated with the presence of Moki steps.  Theories  In consideration of the orientations of the line and circle motifs within the pictographs, the authors of this research conclude that waterglyphs are directional markers pointing toward sources of water throughout the arid Arizona Strip. Amateur archaeologists Robert Ford and Dixon Spendlove assert that the symbols were used by the ancient Pueblo peoples to mark springs or other important travel information in the desert. They assert that a high percentage of these symbols indicates line-of-sight directions to finding a natural spring, water pocket or pool, or ancient village site. They hypothesize that the symbols could be followed, from one water source to the next, across the entire Arizona Strip. Opposing theories include use of these petroglyphs as astronomical/solstice markers, sacrificial altars or writings left by early Spanish explorers.

Author: Paul R Davis Pub:Barbary Press, 2009, These caves can be found on the steep rocky slopes of the Cas Rierons uplands between Cala de Sant Vicent and the village of Sant Vicent de sa Cala. The small cave system was an important place and lay at the heart of Punic religious life more than two thousand years ago. The caves were first inhabited by Bronze Age settlers around 1600 BC and later was made into a shrine by Carthaginian colonist around 500 BC until 300 BC, The Carthaginian came here to worship their deities Reshef and Melkart, after which the caves became a shrine to the goddess Tanit. The caves were rediscovered in 1907 when a series of excavations took place, the last being in 1981. These dig uncovered hundreds of votive offerings which had been placed in the dark recesses of the caves to honour the gods of the ancient world. Many of the objects recovered from the caves can be seen in the Archaeological Museum in Dalt Vila (High Town) in Ibiza Town. On one side of the entrance to the cave there can be seen a cistern which has been cut into the rock. The water gathered here would have been used by the priests.

Author: Stephen Armstrong. Published:Corgi. =The Spanish Civil War= The house thar Raoul Villain had built in the village The bay of Cala de San Vicent has the unenviable claim to fame of being the scene of one of the first war crimes committed on the island of Ibiza. A Frenchman by the name of Raoul Villain Title: The Road to San Vicent. Author: Leif Borthen. Published: Barbury Press. had arrived in Ibiza to hide from his turbulent previous life in France. Villain had been a political assassin and had murdered the leader of the French Socialist Party, Jean Jaur√®s in a Paris caf√© in 1914. Villain was brought to trial for the crime in 1919, and despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, he was acquitted. In fear for his life following threats and intimidation from militant socialist, he fled France and arrived in Ibiza via Mexico. Villain thought that hiding up in the remote north eastern corner of Ibiza he could live anonymously and be forgotten. In 1933 the Bay of Cala de San Vicent was a very quite backwater with no development, there was not even a road into the valley. Villain decided to make his home there. Using local labour and help from Paul Ren√© Gauguin the grandson of Paul Gauguin, he built a house from concrete and had almost finished the building by August 1936. On 13 September a small detachment of soldiers arrived on the beach of Cala de San Vicent by rowing boat. Eyewitness reported that they thought that they may have been Anarchists of the FAI. These soldiers where part of a larger detachment. The Force had arrived on the island to re-secure the island following the mini-coup which had been orchestrated by the Nationalist under the command of Infantry Commander Juli Mestre. Villain had been away visiting a French lady in Santa Eul√†ria des Riu when the soldiers had arrived but had quickly returned home when he had heard of their arrival. Feeling vulnerable, he feared that the soldiers would steel his valuables which he had stashed in the unfinished house. Despite being repeatedly warned by his neighbours, not to go back down to the cove, he still went home. =Execution= The Officer and troops who arrived on the beach that day seemed very suspicious of this Frenchman, who also antagonised the officer with his explanation of why he had set a crucifix on the hill behind his house. Apart from this outward show of religious zeal, the officer was also suspicious of were Villain had been that day, and decided to confine him to his house. He was considered to be a Fascist and a spy and as such a threat to their plans to reoccupy the island. The details of what happened next are sketchy, but what is certain, Villain end with a bullet wound which eventually killed him. It is true that, that afternoon three bombers from the Italian air force had flown along the coast over Cala de Sant Vicent and bombed Ibiza town which could be heard even this far up the coast. It is thought that the troops, on hearing the attack decided to return to the capital and tried to take Villain and his valuables with them. He reacted violently to this extradition, and as a consequence was shot in the back with the bullet exiting via his throat. Unfortunately for Villain he had only been wounded. The officer in charge warned the villages that had come down to see what had happened, not to assist or disturb the mortally wounded man. ‚Äò‚ÄòVillain‚Äô‚Äô lay alone on the sand for two days before he finally died.

The editor runs on the IBM VM/CMS operating system. STET was written to explore an approach to text editing that followed the principles of Structured programming. It allows programs and documentation to be written 'top-down', with blocks of code or text kept to a limited size (usually less than a page). This was \\"a first attempt to take the structure out of the domain of languages, and into the domain of editors. In addition to conventional editing facilities, STET gives the user a third dimension: a tree structure that may be traversed using Program Function Keys much as scrolling is normally implemented\\"STET - A STructured Editing Tool Version 2, Davies, S. and Cowlishaw, M. F., IBM UK Scientific Centre, 30pp, 28th Dec 1980. Principles The editor, like many text editors, is a full-screen editor; a window into the file being edited is displayed and the lines displayed can be edited directly on-screen by insertions, deletions, or overtyping. Editing is also effected by pressing programmable action keys or by typing in commands. Commands are either 'top-line commands' (entered in a command entry area on the top line of the screen) or 'line commands' (entered in a 4-character command entry field adjacent to each displayed line of text). Top-line commands generally apply to the entire file being edited, and include the usual operations such as saving, searching, replacing, movement around the file, and so on (over 60 in all). The STET editor, showing a group of lines about to be formed into a block Line commands apply to a single line or a number of lines, and allow copying, moving, overlaying, merging, uppercasing and the like. An innovation in STET is the ability to mark a group of lines using the \`<\` line command to mark the first and last lines of a group. The group of lines can then be manipulated as a whole; they can be copied, merged, etc., and also make possible the 'structured editing commands' which provide the folding capabilities of the editor. =Structured editing commands= The structured editing facilities of STET are based on the concept that each file is represented as a collection of named blocks of lines. A block is created from an (anonymous) marked group of lines by the command (for example) '\`form commands\`'. This command creates the block with name 'COMMANDS' and replaces the group of lines with a single line with a reference to COMMANDS, identified by its first non-blank character being some special character, by default '\`)\`'. This feature makes it easy to create a structured file from a flat file. The STET editor, showing file structure map after forming the COMMANDS block The block reference concept is very similar to the idea of links in a Wikipedia file, and indeed in STET a block can also be created by putting a new reference on a line and then 'entering' that reference to edit the block. The structured editing commands also allow the user to see a map of the tree structure of the file, list the blocks alphabetically, and navigate the structure of the file. Navigation upwards and downwards or to a named block is possible, along with 'go to next block at this level' (that is, go up a level, find the next block reference at that level, and then go down a level). Other commands allow blocks to be renamed, expanded, etc., and also allow a flat file to be built from all or part of the structured file. Other The editor is written in PL/I except for the 3270 screen interface which is written in Assembler. STET was written and maintained by Mike Cowlishaw from 1976-1979 and then taken over by Steve Davies, who continued to enhance and maintain it through the 1980s. Many of the features in STET were used in later IBM text editors, including XEDIT and Lexx.LEXX - A programmable structured editor, Cowlishaw, M. F., IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol 31, No. 1, 1987, IBM Reprint order number G322-0151 Limitations All files that can be edited are limited to a maximum of 32,767 characters wide (line length) and each block is limited to a maximum of 32,767 lines. An unstructured 'flat file' is edited as a single block. A structured file is stored on disk in a special format which allows efficient loading and navigation of the blocks in the file. This allows each file to also store useful meta-information (such as statistics of action key usage, total edit time, etc.), but has the disadvantage that a flat file has to be 'built' from the structured file before (for example) it can be processed by a compiler or word-processing utility.

Gibbs is the current director of the BCM- HGSC. It occupies more than , employing over 200 staff, including eighteen faculty, and is one of three National Institutes of Health funded genome centers that were involved in the completion of the first human genome sequence in 2004. The BCM-HGSC contributed approximately 10 percent of the total project by sequencing chromosomes 3, 12 and X. The BCM-HGSC collaborated with researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Celera Genomics to sequence the first species of fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The BCM-HGSC also completed the second species of fruit fly (Drosophila pseudoobscura), the honeybee (Apis mellifera), and led an international consortium to sequence the brown Norway rat. The Human Genome Sequencing Center subsequently sequenced and annotated the genome of the cow (Bos taurus), the sea urchin, rhesus macaque, tammar wallaby, Dictyostelium discoideum, and a number of bacteria that cause serious infections (Rickettsia typhi, Enterococcus faecium, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The BCM-HGSC was a major contributor to the Mammalian Gene Collection program, to sequence all human cDNAs, as well as the International Haplotype Mapping Project (HapMap). Other research within the BCM-HGSC includes new molecular technologies for mapping and sequencing, exploration of novel chemistries for DNA tagging, development of instrumentation for DNA manipulation, building new computer programs for genomic data analysis, and studying the genes expressed in childhood leukemias, the genomic differences that lead to evolutionary changes, the role of host genetic variation in the course of infectious disease, and the molecular basis of specific genetic diseases. The sequencing for the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel was performed here. The DGRP is a collaborative effort started by Trudy Mackay to establish a common standard for Drosophila melanogaster research.

The primary vector which spreads T. parva between cattle is a tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. East Coast fever is of major economic importance to livestock farmers in Africa, killing at least one million cattle each year. The disease occurs in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Zambia. In 2003, East Coast fever was introduced to Comoros by cattle imported from Tanzania. It has been eradicated in South Africa. A more acute form of East Coast fever called corridor disease occurs when buffalo-derived T. parva is transmitted to cattle. Another form, called January disease, only occurs over the winter months in Zimbabwe due to the tick lifecycle. Native cattle are often resistant to the parasite, but not without symptoms. They are hosts to the parasite, but do not suffer as severely as foreign cattle.International Livestock Research Institute Clinical signs and diagnosis Mortality can be up to 100%, with death occurring around 18‚Äì30 days after the initial attachment of infected ticks, because the incubation required is around 10‚Äì25 days, and the parasite spreads quickly and is rather aggressive. Clinical signs include fever and enlarged lymph nodes near the tick bites. Smears and stains can also be done to check for the parasite. Schizonts (meronts, or segmentors) can be found in infected lymphocytes. Pathology includes anorexia, dyspnea, corneal opacity, nasal discharge, frothy nasal discharge, diarrhea, pulmonary edema, leukopenia, and anemia. Endemic cattle given medication sometimes recover to varying degrees, or death follows due to blocked capillaries and parasites infecting the central nervous system. Cattle in endemic areas which survive infection become carriers. For diagnosis, post mortem findings are characteristic and mainly include damage to the lymphoid and respiratory systems. Treatment and control One study using the medicinal plant Peganum harmala showed it to have a lifesaving effect on cattle infected with East Coast fever. The classical treatment with tetracyclines (1970‚Äì1990) cannot provide efficiency more than 50%. Since the early 1990s, buparvaquone is used in bovine theileriosis with remarkable results (90 to 98% recovery). Other than the buparvaquones, other chemotherapeutic options are the parvaquones, e.g. Clexon. Halofuginone lactate has also been shown to have an 80.5% efficacy against Theirelia parva parva infections. The ultimate factor that causes death is pulmonary edema. In May 2010, a vaccine to protect cattle against East Coast fever reportedly had been approved and registered by the governments of Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania. SciDev.net (7 May 2010). This consists of cryopreserved sporozoites from crushed ticks, but it is expensive and can cause disease. Control of the disease relies on control of ticks of domestic animals. This is a major concern in tropical countries with large livestock populations, especially in the endemic area. Pesticides (acaricides) are applied in dipping baths or spray races, and cattle breeds with good ability to acquire immune resistance to the vector ticks are used. History This disease was first reported in southern Africa, south of the Zambezi river, in 1902. It became known as East Coast fever after it was determined that the disease had originated in cattle imported from the East Coast of Africa.

The dispute reached the California Supreme Court in 2016. History and notable cases Heller Ehrman had its beginning in 1890 when Emanuel S. Heller opened his law practice at 124 Sansome Street, Room 30, in San Francisco, California. Heller was a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, received his law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law and passed the California Bar in 1889. In 1891, he became the primary attorney of banker Isaias W. Hellman and moved his office to the headquarters of Hellman's Nevada Bank (Heller would marry Hellman's daughter in 1899). In 1896, Francis H. Powers joined with Heller and the partnership name changed to Heller & Powers. In 1905, Sidney M. Ehrman (married to Isaias W. Hellman's other daughter Florence) and also a graduate of the Hastings, entered into partnership with Heller and Powers, forming Heller Powers & Ehrman. In 1921, Jerome White and Florence McAuliffe joined the partnership after the death of Francis Powers, establishing the firm as Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP. The firm retained this name for more than 84 years until the name was shortened in 2005.According to Carole Hicke at Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe: A Century of Service to Clients and Community, 1991. Between the years 1974 to 2007, Heller Ehrman realized an increase in business, causing the firm to branch out from the west coast with an additional 12 offices in locations ranging from London to Singapore. In 1986 the San Francisco headquarters was moved to a new skyscraper at 333 Bush Street. By 1991, the firm had 370 lawyers, over 3.5 times the number it had employed just ten years earlier. In 1993, the first advertisement ever sold on the Internet was sold on the Global Network Navigator (now America On-Line) to Heller Ehrman LLP, and in 1994, Heller Ehrman launched the first law firm website.

It was the first full-time radio station in Herkimer County.\\"200 Years Of Herkimer County\\" book, published 1991 by the Herkimer County Historical Society Broadcasting from a studio on South Second Street (in a building which still houses its transmitter), WLFH was a typical full service station offering a variety of formats, including MOR and Top 40.http://threerivershms.com/lf5.htm By the end of the 1980's, WLFH was a country music station. In 1994, WLFH became part of Bug Country, simulcasting WBUG-FM in Fort Plain and WBUG (now WVTL) in Amsterdam. The stations mostly broadcast the Real Country satellite classic country format from ABC Radio, but retained some local production. In 2000, WLFH was acquired by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) and became part of a four-station simulcast known as the \\"Sports Stars Radio Network\\", along with WRNY in Rome, WADR (now WRCK) in Remsen and WUTQ (now WUSP) in Utica. The stations carried a variety of local and syndicated sports talk programming, along with live coverage of local sporting events. The Sports Stars network also carried an affiliation with Fox Sports Radio, as was the standard for Clear Channel sports radio stations. In 2005, as part of a company-wide rebranding, television station WIXT (channel 9) in Syracuse changed its call sign to WSYR- TV, and Clear Channel chose to park the WIXT calls on WLFH to maintain control of them. In 2007, Clear Channel divested its Utica stations, including WIXT. The station, along with WRNY, was transferred to Galaxy Communications, which retained their sports format and paired the two stations with its own WTLB. WIXT remained associated with Fox Sports Radio, but the stations changed their identification from \\"Sports Stars\\" to \\"1310 The Game.\\" In 2010, Galaxy reached an affiliation deal with ESPN Radio, in which their Utica and Syracuse AM stations would join the network. The deal took effect on March 5, and WTLB/WIXT/WRNY promptly dropped Fox Sports to join ESPN. In 2016 Galaxy moved their Utica studios (WKLL, WOUR, WUMX, WTLB, WRNY and WIXT) from Washington Mills to Downtown Utica inside the new Landmarc Building (the old HSBC Location) and renamed it Galaxy Media. Inside their new location the walls on the side of the street for each studio are made entirely of glass, allowing people to see DJ's at work similar to the \\"Good Morning America\\" Studios (Galaxy has long used a similar layout for their studio in Syracuse).

Adherents of this religion have built chapels of Humanity in France and Brazil. In the United States and Europe, Comte's ideas influenced others, and contributed to the emergence of ethical societies and \\"ethical churches\\", which led to the development of Ethical culture, congregational humanist, and secular humanist organisations. Origins Comte developed the Religion of Humanity for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. The religion was developed after Comte's passionate platonic relationship with Clotilde de Vaux, whom he idealised after her death. He became convinced that feminine values embodied the triumph of sentiment and morality. In a future science- based Positivist society there should also be a religion that would have power by virtue of moral force alone.Rollin Chambliss, Social Thought: From Hammurabi to Comte, Dryden Press, New York, 1954, p.424. In 1849, he proposed a calendar reform called the \\"positivist calendar\\", in which months were named after history's greatest leaders, thinkers, and artists, and arranged in chronological order. Each day was dedicated to a thinker. Tenets According to Tony Davies, Comte's secular and positive religion was \\"a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity\\", referred to as the Nouveau Grand-√ätre Supr√™me (New Supreme Great Being). \\"This was later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the Grand F√©tish (the Earth) and the Grand Milieu (Cosmic Space)\\".Davies, Tony. Humanism, The New Critical Idiom. Drakakis, John, series editor. University of Stirling, UK. Routledge, 1997, p.28-29 In Syst√®me de politique positive (1851‚Äì1854) Comte stated that the pillars of the religion are: * altruism, leading to generosity and selfless dedication to others. * order: Comte thought that after the French Revolution, society needed restoration of order. * progress: the consequences of industrial and technical breakthroughs for human societies. In Cat√©chisme positiviste (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's seven sacraments: * Introduction; (nomination and sponsoring) * Admission; (end of education) * Destination; (choice of a career) * Marriage; * Retirement; (age 63), * Separation; (social extreme unction), * Incorporation; (absorption into history) ‚Äì 3 years after death. Liturgy and priesthood upright=1.2 The Religion of Humanity was described by Thomas Huxley as \\"Catholicism minus Christianity\\". In addition to a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth and Destiny, it had a priesthood. Priests were required to be married, because of the ennobling influence of womanhood. They would conduct services, including Positivist prayer, which was \\"a solemn out-pouring, whether in private or in public, of men's nobler feelings, inspiring them with larger and more comprehensive thoughts.\\" The purpose of the religion was to increase altruism, so that believers acted always in the best interests of humanity as a whole. The priests would be international ambassadors of altruism, teaching, arbitrating in industrial and political disputes, and directing public opinion. They should be scholars, physicians, poets and artists. Indeed all the arts, including dancing and singing should be practiced by them, like bards in ancient societies. This required long training. They began training from the age of twenty-eight, studying in positivist schools. From thirty-five to forty-two a priest served in an apprentice position as teacher and ritualist. Only at the age of forty-two could he become a full priest. They earned no money and could not hold offices outside the priesthood. In this way their influence was purely spiritual and moral. The High Priest of Humanity was to live in Paris, which would replace Rome as the centre of religion. Influence Davies argues that Comte's austere and \\"slightly dispiriting\\" philosophy of humanity ‚Äì viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by \\"positive\\" science) ‚Äì \\"was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx\\". The system was ultimately unsuccessful but, along with Darwin's On the Origin of Species, it influenced the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comte's English followers, including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to \\"vivre pour altrui\\" (\\"live for others\\", from which comes the word \\"altruism\\"). Profound criticism came from John Stuart Mill who advocated Comte but dismissed his Religion of Humanity in a move towards a differentiation between the (good) early Comte, the author of The Course in Positive Philosophy and the (problematic) late Comte, who authored the Religion of Humanity.See the central passage of Mill's Auguste Comte and Positivism: John Stuart Mill on Auguste Comte‚Äôs Religion of Humanity () While sympathising with the need for a secular religion, and appreciating Comte‚Äôs respect for ‚Äúthe Human Race, conceived as a continuous whole, including the past, the present and the future‚Äù, Mill thought that the details of Comte‚Äôs ritualism were not only illiberal but ‚Äúcould have been written by no man who had ever laughed‚Äù.Mill, in A Ryan, ‚Äò‚ÄôJ S Mill‚Äô‚Äô (London 1974) p. 234-5 The social impact of Comte's ideas is hard to fully gauge but examples can be found in history. One of Comte's devoted English followers had been Henry Beveridge. Influenced by his father's ideas, the younger William Beveridge laid the foundations for the welfare state in Britain with a major report, precipitating the creation of the National Health Service. = Brazil= Comtean Positivism was relatively popular in Brazil. In 1881 Miguel Lemos and Raimundo Teixeira Mendes organized the \\"Positivist Church of Brazil.\\" In 1897 the \\"Temple of Humanity\\" was created.Latin American Thought: Philosophical Problems and Arguments By Susana Nuccetelli: Page 184 The services at the Temple could go on for up to four hours and that, combined with a certain moral strictness, led to some decline during the Republican period.The Human Tradition in Modern Brazil By Peter M. Beattie: Pages 112‚Äì113 Nevertheless it had appeal with the military class as Benjamin Constant joined the group before breaking with it because he deemed Mendes and Lemos as too fanatical. C√¢ndido Rondon's conversion proved more solid as he remained an orthodox Positivist and a member of the faith long after the church's importance waned.Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83‚Äì84 Although declined, the church still survives in Brazil. The national flag of Brazil bears the \\"Ordem e Progresso\\" (\\"Order and Progress\\"), inspired by Comte's motto of positivism: \\"L‚Äôamour pour principe et l‚Äôordre pour base; le progr√®s pour but\\" (\\"Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal\\").Bandeiras e significados Historianet. Retrieved on 2010-10-09. .  Other examples  There are more examples of Religion of Humanity started by positivists, and there are several authors who have given the epithet to the religion they support, whatever the religion. In India Baba Faqir Chand established Manavta Mandir (Temple of Humanity) to spread his religion of humanity with scientific attitude as explained by David C. Lane in a book The Unknowing Sage. Comte influenced the thought of Victorian secularists George Holyoake (coiner of the term \\"secularism\\") and Richard Congreve.

History The Grand Union Canal was a late addition to the British canal system, being formed in 1929 by the amalgamation of a number of canal companies. This included the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, which was authorised in 1793 by an Act of Parliament, in the same year that the Grand Junction Canal from Braunston to Brentford was authorised. The Warwick and Napton Canal, authorised in 1794, provided a link from the southern end of the canal to the Oxford Canal at Napton Junction, from which it was a short distance to Braunston and the route to London. The two Warwick canals opened officially on 19 December 1799, but were probably unfinished, as no trade occurred until the following March. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was also authorised in 1793, as business men in the town wanted to ensure that the prosperity brought by the canals did not pass them by. The canal was to run from Kings Norton Junction, on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, to Stratford, passing through Kingswood. The first part of the northern section to Hockley Heath was opened in 1796, but then the scheme foundered. It was not until 1800, when another Act of Parliament was obtained, that further progress was made, and the canal opened as far at Kingswood, and the junction with the Warwick and Birmingham Canal in 1803. There was then another delay, with construction of the southern route below Kingswood not starting until 1812. The canal finally reached Stratford in 1815. Although the junction was never officially closed, it was effectively closed in the 1940s. Parts of the southern section of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal were dry, while there was little traffic on the northern section after 1939, which allowed the Great Western Railway to repair the Lifford swing bridge near Kings Norton Junction in 1942 in such a way that it could not be opened. The route from Kings Norton to Kingswood junctions was the scene of one of the first campaigns by the fledgling Inland Waterways Association, when Tom Rolt announced in 1947 that he intended to navigate along the canal. The Railway company had to jack the bridge up, to allow his boat to pass, and the event was widely reported in newspapers, gaining useful publicity. The route from the junction to Stratford was reopened in 1964 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, having been taken over and restored by the National Trust. Location The junction consists of a 250-metre linking arm with two branches at the (western) Stratford Canal end and a simple junction with the Grand Union at the eastern end. One of the branches descends through a lock to the connecting arm. The other branch is taken from the Stratford canal below another lock. The Stratford Canal (the Northern Stratford Canal) heads, via a flight of locks, towards the Worcester and Birmingham Canal at Kings Norton Junction. South of Kingswood Junction the Southern Stratford Canal descends through locks to the River Avon at Stratford-upon-Avon. The Grand Union leads north to Knowle Locks, and then Birmingham, and leads south to Hatton Locks and Warwick.

Biography He was born in Dorking, Surrey in 1938, the son of Kenneth and Sybil Hacker.Who‚Äôs Who 1975, page 1302, (A&C; Black: London) After attending Dulwich College (from 1950 to 1955, under Stanley Wilson until the end of 1953), he went on to study at the Royal Academy of Music where he won the Dove Prize and the Boise Travelling Scholarship which he used to study in Paris, Bayreuth and Vienna. In 1958 he joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra. He became a professor of the Royal Academy of Music in 1960 and went on to found the Pierrot Players in 1965 along with American pianist Stephen Pruslin and Harrison Birtwistle. In 1966, a thrombosis on his spinal column caused permanent paraplegia. For the rest of his life he used a wheelchair and drove adapted cars. In 1972, the Pierrot Players renamed themselves the Fires of London, and Hacker continued to perform with them until 1976. In 1971, he founded his own group, Matrix. He was also appointed chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts Music section and of the British section of the International Society for Contemporary Music. He was one of those credited with reviving the basset clarinet, and in 1967, he restored the original text of Mozart's Concerto and Quintet. He played them on an instrument modelled on that for which Mozart originally wrote them, the Stadler's extended basset clarinet. Hacker also founded the Music Party in 1972, an organisation set up for the authentic performance of classical music. The later establishment of the Classical Orchestra in York was also a vehicle which promoted the performances of the classics on original instruments. Hacker also branched out into conducting opera, where he led performances of works from Monteverdi's Ulisse to Birtwistle's The Io Passion. In the 1972‚Äì1973 academic year he became the Sir Robert Mayer lecturer at Leeds University. In 1976 he was appointed lecturer in music at the University of York and went on to hold a post of senior lecturer between 1984 and 1987. Hacker was awarded the OBE for his services to music in 1988. In 1994, he was a guest on Desert Island Discs. Personal life Hacker was married three times. In 1959, he married Anna Maria Sroka, with whom he had two daughters, Katy and Sophie. His second marriage, to Karen Wynne Evans in 1976, produced a son, Al Cohen. His third wife, Margaret Lee, survives him, as do his children and first two wives.

It was published in 1821 by Cauchy,. but remained relatively unknown until Hadamard rediscovered it.. Translated from the Italian by Warren Van Egmond. Hadamard's first publication of this result was in 1888;. he also included it as part of his 1892 Ph.D. thesis.. Also in Th√®ses pr√©sent√©es √† la facult√© des sciences de Paris pour obtenir le grade de docteur √®s sciences math√©matiques, Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1892. Theorem for one complex variable Consider the formal power series in one complex variable z of the form :f(z) = \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} c_{n} (z-a)^{n} where a,c_n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}. Then the radius of convergence R of ∆í at the point a is given by :\\\\frac{1}{R} = \\\\limsup_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\big(  c_{n} ^{1/n} \\\\big) where lim sup denotes the limit superior, the limit as n approaches infinity of the supremum of the sequence values after the nth position. If the sequence values are unbounded so that the lim sup is ‚àû, then the power series does not converge near a, while if the lim sup is 0 then the radius of convergence is ‚àû, meaning that the series converges on the entire plane. =Proof= Without loss of generality assume that a=0. We will show first that the power series \\\\sum c_n z^n converges for z, and then that it diverges for z>R. First suppose z. Let t=1/R not be 0 or \\\\pm\\\\infty. For any \\\\varepsilon > 0, there exists only a finite number of n such that \\\\sqrt[n]{c_n}\\\\geq t+\\\\varepsilon. Now c_n\\\\leq(t+\\\\varepsilon)^n for all but a finite number of c_n, so the series \\\\sum c_n z^n converges if z < 1/(t+\\\\varepsilon). This proves the first part. Conversely, for \\\\varepsilon > 0, c_n\\\\geq (t-\\\\varepsilon)^n for infinitely many c_n, so if z=1/(t-\\\\varepsilon) > R, we see that the series cannot converge because its nth term does not tend to 0.

Competing in four Winter Olympics, he earned his best finish of fourth in the four-man event at Albertville in 1992. Lori won the Bobsleigh Overall World Cup four-man championship in 1989-90. He won nine Crystal Globes for top three finishes in Overall World Cup final standingsworld cup historical results at fibt.com and totaled twenty two World Cup medals and fourteen Canadian Championship titles. He Lori was instrumental in establishing Canada as a world power in the sport of bobsledding. In 1987, Lori cheated death in a horrific crash in Cervinia, Italy, a track now closed due to its high rate of severe injuries, where he broke two ribs, clavicle and nose, suffered severe lacerations requiring skin grafting on his face, shoulder, hands and thigh. The following year, he recovered to qualify for his first Olympic games. In 1990, he and his team returned to Cervinia in the second to last World Cup race of the year where they set the track record, putting the team in position to win the Overall World cup, which they accomplished by winning the final race in Calgary and becoming the first non- Europeans to win the Overall World Cup in bobsleigh. Chris Lori also competed on Canada's National Track and Field Team in the decathlon event in 1980 (Jr.), 1983, 1984 and 1985, although he did not qualify for the Olympic games, before fully committing to bobsledding, which he started in October 1984. As a track and field athlete, Lori won silver medal in the pole vault at the Jr. Nationals in 1980 and a silver medal at the Canadian University championships in 1984, and was awarded \\"All Canadian\\" honours. Lori later became coach of the American bobsleigh team for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City where the USA four-man teams won Olympic silver and bronze.

It provides a full university preparatory program for children aged 3-18. The school provides a US curriculum within an international community. The school is fully accredited by the Council of International Schools and the Middle States Association Commission for Elementary and Secondary Schools. Overview ASH was founded in 1953. Its purpose was to provide an American style education to children of international cooperation and government employees. The board of trustees has eleven members who are elected by the parents. The school is accredited by the Middle States Association and by the Council of International Schools. The school has three divisions, elementary school, middle school and high school. In 1989 a new campus was built, next to the Rijksstraatweg in Wassenaar which was opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and First Lady Barbara Bush. Admissions ESL support is provided, but in the high school a reasonable knowledge of academic English is required. Children entering K-1 must turn age 4 before October 1 of that year. Class and grade level assignment is determined by looking at past records.The American School of The Hague ‚Äì Welcome to Admissions Schools = Elementary school= The Arts, Dutch, Computer, Library and PE are taught by specialists. Field trips are regular and are linked back to the curriculum. More than 50 teachers work in the Elementary School. the Elementary School Principal was Tim Messick. There is an art program called Art Masterpiece sponsored by the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) intended according to the school to make connections between great works and students' lives. Parents introduce the students to pieces of art from different time periods and different media; the students are expected to think about what they see, about techniques and they should form opinions. The elementary wing of the main ASH campus, for second to fourth grade, is located at the North East side of the school. It has its own atrium, cafeteria, library, playgrounds, gym, music and performance suites and technology labs. In the summer of 2012, the Early Childhood Center (ECC), for Elementary School children from Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 1, was built. =Middle school= Grades 5 - 8 are seen as middle school age students.The American School of The Hague ‚Äì Middle School Welcome The middle school has its own library, and shares the theater and other parts of the arts and modern languages departments with the high school. The middle school has a South, West, and a North wing. Students in middle school can choose from a variety of extra-curricular activities. There is an art club, chess club, the drama club who do a play in November/December, a talent show in the spring, there is an Honor Band, Honor Choir, a spring musical, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. The 5 core classes in middle school are Math, Science, Social Studies/Humanities, Language Arts/English, and Physical Education. Students also take additional classes, being language classes such as Spanish, French, or Dutch, and art classes such as Theater, Information Technology, Mindfulness, Design Technology, or Home Economics. =High school= Grades 9 - 12 are seen as high school age students.The American School of The Hague ‚Äì High School Welcome The high school has about 410 students. The high school has two wings of the campus, one for Math and Modern Languages, and another for all other subjects except the arts. All arts and P.E classes are located on another side of the campus. the interim high school principal was Joanne Reykdal, and the high school dean was Karla Uhlenhake. Curriculum Monument at the entrance of the school Students must have a certain number of credits to be eligible for a high school diploma at the end of year 12. Required credits are: *Four English credits, *1 credit human understanding (Ex. philosophy), *three credits Social Studies, *three credits in Mathematics, *three credits in Science, **in three different types of Science, *two credits in Modern Language, **students must reach the third level of a language, *one IT credit, *two credits in the Art Department, *1.5 P.E. credits, *Half a credit of Health Class, *3 credits in other electives, meaning anything that does not fit in the previous categories or any credit that exceeds the minimum stated above. Students can choose American High school classes, AP or IB. Extra- curricular activities =Sport= ASH offers a variety of sports for all ages. ASH offers sports for high schoolers at both Varsity and Junior Varsity level. The following sports are offered at ASH: Baseball, Basketball, Cross- Country, Swimming, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Track and Field, Volleyball. At the varsity level students participate in the International Schools Sports Tournament playing teams from Paris, London, Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich, Sigtuna and other places. There are also practice squads (intramural sports) for those students not playing on JV or Varsity teams. =JoJo Club= In late 2017, a group of students who liked the manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure created a club dedicated to this interest. The club initially embarked on what they named \\"The Holy JoJo Marathon,\\" in which they watched the first three parts of the JoJo's anime adaptation. While they did begin the fourth part, they never finished watching due to a variety of reasons, mainly the start of a new school year and the fact that the anime adaptation of JoJo part 5, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind, started airing, which made them switch to watching that instead. Ever since late 2018, the JoJo Club has expanded its interests and has watched other anime shows other than JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Welcome to the N.H.K.. The club is known throughout the school for having produced a trailer that was met with an overwhelmingly positive critical reception when shown at a school assembly. The current club leader has said more than once that a second trailer is in the works, stating that \\"now that we know people like this sort of stuff we can go all out on our next one.\\" Currently no release date nor any further info on the second trailer has been disclosed. =Model United Nations= ASH's Model United Nations team has participated The Hague International Model United Nations for almost 40 years. It brings more than 3,000 students together from 125 schools during the last week in January. Students from ASH can become delegation members, administrative staff, or an officer. =National Honor Society= The ASH National Honor Society is an exclusive group for students who are selected based on their service, character, and leadership. Students participate in projects at the school. =ASH Trade and Finance Club = The ASH Trade and Finance Club is a club that discusses investing techniques and the implementation of these techniques in the real market per se. =Other activities= The school newspaper at ASH is called The Echo, and they publish weekly at theecho.nl. Peer Support Program. Peer Support Trainees help their peers and facilitate discussion groups and learn to help Kindergarten through grade 12 students in advisory on various subjects. Students from Grade 3 to Grade 12 can choose to be a part of the Student Ambassador program at ASH. The Student Ambassador program at ASH is renowned worldwide for its ability to welcome new students, families, and staff into the community. In the high school, Student Ambassadors organise an Orientation Week in which new students and their families learn their way around the school as well as meeting new people. The Student Senate helps classmates enjoy their school year by organizing dances and by advocating for student issues. ASH dedicates one day in the spring to International Day where students and staff dress up in their national \\"costumes.\\" Elementary School rooms are decorated to portray various nations and the high school sets up booths in the cafeteria, where students may try foods and snacks from different cultures. =Performing Arts= Students can audition for the dance team in September. Every year, in December the high school musical takes place. In 2015, the musical was Footloose. In 2014, the musical was West Side Story. In 2013 the musical performed was Fiddler on the Roof. In the past musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar (2012), Pump Boys and Dinettes (2011), and Pippin (2010) have been produced. Auditions are necessary to get in. In spring there is high school play or sometimes an opera. There is a choir and band that students can join. Lastly, students can choose to participate in the Speech and Debate Tournaments where students from various International Schools meet to debate. Also in middle school every year in May they have a musical. Past musicals include \\"H.M.S. Pinafore\\" (2013), \\"Beauty and the Beast Jr.\\" (2012), \\"The Lamp of Underdal\\" (2011, written by ASH), \\"Seussical\\" (2010), The Pirates of Penzance Jr. (2009), Mulan Jr. (2008), Honk! Jr. (2007), and Guys and Dolls Jr. (2006). Most of the Musical School musicals are Jr. because they are shortened versions of full length musicals and are appropriate for middle school. There is a large annual concert at ASH for Grades 3 - 12 called Extravaganza. In Middle School and high school, one can participate in 1 or more of the music classes at ASH including Choir, Strings, and Band. There are also many opportunities for students to get involved in music not only during school, but after as well. For example, ASH has an auditioned after-school vocal ensemble called JAKK, this group performs a variety of genres from Pop to Classical to Jazz, they mainly sing A Cappella. Furthermore, ASH offers a Jazz Band which performs at various locations around Holland. An audition is required to get into the Jazz Band as well.

He had maintained a close friendship with his West Point classmate Fitzhugh Lee, and served under him as a brigadier in the Overland Campaign. He was then given command of the Valley District, where he supervised intelligence-gathering operations by Mosby's Rangers. Early and family life Born in Newport, Rhode Island on November 4, 1835 to the former Elizabeth Virginia Lindsay (1800-after 1860) and her husband, Major Mann Page Lomax (1787-1842), Lunsford Lomax was descended from the First Families of Virginia. His father was a career U.S. Army officer, specializing in artillery, who had served in New Orleans during the War of 1812, and married in 1820 during his leave in Norfolk, Virginia. He was named for his great grandfather, Lunsford Lomax (1705-1772) of \\"Portabago\\" plantation in Caroline County, who also served part-time in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1742 until 1756 representing that county before the American Revolutionary War. His grandfather Thomas Lomax (1750-1835) served on the Caroline County Committee of Safety during the Revolutionary War and later in the Virginia House of Delegates. His father died of tuberculosis in Cambridge, Massachusetts when this Lunsford Lomax was seven. He had five sisters, Ann (b. 1832), Virginia (b. 1832), Victoria (b. 1833), Julia (b. 1835) and Mary (b. 1835). His mother raised him and his sisters in Norfolk, but by 1860 the Lomax womenfolk (his sisters remaining unmarried) had moved to Washington, D.C.1850 U.S. Federal census for Norfolk, 1860 U.S. Federal census for Washington, D.C. Ward 1, both available on ancestry.com After a private education, Lomax received an \\"at-large\\" appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1856 with fellow Virginia classmate and friend Fitzhugh Lee. Lunsford Lomax married Elizabeth Winter Payne (1850-1932), like him descended from the First Families of Virginia, on February 20, 1873 in Fauquier County, Virginia, and they would have daughters Elizabeth Lindsay Lomax Wood (1874‚Äì1951) and Anne Tayloe Lomax (1887‚Äì1961).will available online at ancestry.com, as well as entry at findagrave.com no. 11016 U.S. Army career Assigned to the prestigious 2nd Cavalry regiment, Lomax fought on the frontier and served in Bleeding Kansas during the years immediately preceding the conflict. American Civil War Lomax resigned from the army in April 1861, and shortly thereafter accepted a captain's commission in Virginia state militia. Initially assigned to Joseph E. Johnston's staff as assistant adjutant general, Lomax later served as inspector general for Benjamin McCulloch. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was transferred back to the Eastern Theater. Appointed colonel of the 11th Virginia Cavalry in time for the Gettysburg campaign, Lomax was promoted to brigadier general after the battle. Lomax fought his brigade under the division command of his old classmate Fitzhugh Lee from Culpeper Courthouse through the Wilderness and around Petersburg. He was promoted to major general in August 1864 and was assigned to assist General Jubal Early in the Shenandoah Valley. After escaping capture at the Battle of Woodstock, Lomax was given command of the Valley District. When Richmond was evacuated, Lomax tried to join forces with John Echols's men at Lynchburg, Virginia, but unable to do so, Lomax finally surrendered with Joe Johnston in North Carolina. Lesser known is Lomax's role in the formation of the partisan units that fought in Northern Virginia during the latter part of the War. In a statement made to Caroline Harper Long shortly before his death, published in the Baltimore Sun in 1920 by Beth Rhoades, entitled \\"Gray Ghost of the Confederacy,\\" John Mosby writes: > General Lomax was with McCulloch in West Tennessee and after McCulloch was > killed he was with Van Dorn. In the Fall of 1862 he was ordered to Richmond > on a special mission. He was then detailed back to Van Dorn just before > Christmas. He was a Lt.

Part of the opacity that surrounds Lomax's military career rests with him being the commanding officer of Mosby and the other partisan units in the Valley that brought information to General Lee and others. In fact, Mosby told Caroline Harper, an acquaintance who had been raised in the same aristocratic circles of Old Virginia, the illegitimate daughter of a prominent politician, that he had not felt he could even give the interview until Lomax's death, in order to protect him, for they were the closest of friends, both during and after the war. Postwar years After Appomattox, Lomax farmed in Caroline and Fauquier counties for over 20 years. He was appointed president of the Virginia Agriculture and Mechanical College in 1886, serving until resigning in 1891. He continued contact with Jubal Early, and months after the death of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, vehemently objected to his daughter Winnie's proposed marriage to Alfred Wilkinson, a New Yorker whose father had been an abolitionist. Lomax later became a clerk in the War Department assembling and editing the Official Records of the war and was for a time commissioner of Gettysburg National Park. Death and legacy Lomax's grave in the Warrenton Cemetery Marshall Messenger, 28 May 1913 Lomax died May 28, 1913 and was buried in Warrenton, Virginia.

On November 8, 2019 he was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. He is the creator and host of the Weekend Top30 Countdown and the Remix Top30 Countdown heard in over 150 cities in the United States and throughout the world on Premiere Radio Networks and the American Forces Network. He can also be heard live weekday afternoons on WKTU in New York City. On October 5, 2018 iHeartMedia announced a new long-term agreement with Hamilton. Robert Pittman (media executive), Chairman and CEO of iHeartMedia, Inc stated ‚ÄúHollywood Hamilton is one of the most loved, respected and recognized voices and names in radio, his unparalleled ability to connect with both listeners and music's biggest artists is a true representation of what makes radio the most powerful medium in the U.S. Early life Hamilton was born and raised in both Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada. Both his parents were in show business; his father, Al, was the entertainment director for major Nevada hotels and casinos, and also a comedian who performed in those establishments. Hamilton's mother, April Ames, was a singer for Harry James, Sam Donahue, Buddy Rich, and others during the \\"big band\\" era. She made appearances on Johnny Carson and George Gobel television shows. Later, during the 1970s, she performed on the Nevada casino circuit with her own band, April Ames and The Dames. Hamilton got the nickname \\"Hollywood\\" when he was nine years old. Sitting backstage watching his father's Las Vegas show while wearing a suit and bow tie, one of his father's showgirls passed by, stopped, and called him \\"Little Hollywood\\". Broadcasting career While still in high school Hamilton landed his first job in commercial radio after gaining recognition from an illegal pirate radio station, broadcasting from a walk-in closet in his parents' home in Reno, Nevada. After weeks of complaints from local commercial radio stations the Federal Communications Commission issued a formal cease and desist. It wasn't until then, that Hamilton's parents even knew of such an operation. In 1990 actor Christian Slater studied the role of playing a DJ for the motion picture Pump Up the Volume under the tutelage of then friend Hamilton. Because Sean Hamilton's start in radio was very similar to the storyline in the movie, Christian's Mother Mary Jo Slater had personally asked Sean if he'd work with Christian on and off the air while working at KIISFM in Los Angeles. Z100 New York, KIISFM Los Angeles & KBIG/MYFM Los Angeles After spending only a year broadcasting in his hometown, Hamilton decided to hit the road hoping to achieve the big time one day. After three years of traveling and working for a couple small market radio stations like KLAV in Las Vegas and KIDD in Monterey, he ended up in a small town in central New Jersey called Long Branch at a station called WWZY Y-107. In 1983 while broadcasting one night, his big break came when a then famous radio executive Scott Shannon was flying commercially over Long Branch and heard Sean on the air. Upon Shannon's arrival at his destination Sean was immediately offered a job to be part of creating and premiering what is now the largest and most influential radio station in the world today, New York's WHTZ/Z100. At just 20 years old and only four years after building his small pirate radio station in Reno, Nevada, he was now on the air at Z100 in New York City. After Z100s premiere on August 2, 1983 with its legendary campaign \\"Worst to First\\", the station went #1 in the ratings in just 74 days. Hamilton flying with the United States Blue Angels in 1997.During those four years working in New York he helped launch and introduce such new artists as Madonna, Duran Duran, U2, Cyndi Lauper and Prince, just to name a few. Hamilton remained at Z100 from 1983-87. In 1987, Hamilton was asked to head out west to join Rick Dees and 102.7 KIIS-FM. During his seven years at KIISFM he headed up a very popular concert series called ‚ÄúRad Pack.‚Äù This was a concert series where many of the biggest music and teen celebrities at the time would come together to raise money for the newly found D.A.R.E. foundation (Drug Abuse Resistance Education). The attention of this series caught the eye of then President George H.W. Bush where Hamilton was asked to join the President for several youth anti-drug appearances. Working with President George H.W. Bush at a youth anti-drug rally in 1991. During the late eighties through the mid-nineties while at KIIS-FM, Hamilton made many other notable high-profile appearances such as participating in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race Grand Prix of Long Beach and being part of the Los Angeles Air Show where he trained and flew with the United States Navy Blue Angels. Hamilton remained at KIIS-FM from 1987-94. In 1995 he was on KGGI in Riverside.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Other-Documments/LA-Radio-Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1995-07-08.pdf In April 2009, Clear Channel hand picked Hamilton to become the new afternoon drive host on KBIG-FM, known as 104.3 MYfm in Los Angeles. He was Clear Channel's only \\"music\\" radio personality to have an afternoon show broadcasting simultaneously in both New York and Los Angeles, Monday through Friday. Although Hamilton was live on WKTU on the east coast, his show was prerecorded three hours prior to airing at three PM on the west coast. This method of pre- recording a broadcast shift is called \\"tracking\\" and has been much criticized within the industry. In January 2011 Hamilton resigned his west coast \\"tracking\\" duties for MYfm. Lovelines In 1979, while working on his first commercial radio station, KCBN in Reno Nevada, Hamilton created the popular radio show called Lovelines. In 1983 shortly after being hired at Z100 in New York Hamilton resurrected the show and called it \\"Hollywood Hamilton's Midnight Lovelines\\", which offered medical and relationship advice to listeners, often with the assistance of guests, including actors and members of popular bands. After the show became a huge hit in New York Hamilton signed the rights over to the Westwood One Radio Network for an undisclosed financial amount, stopped hosting it and moved to Los Angeles to work for KIIS-FM. The name was then changed from \\"Lovelines\\" to \\"Loveline\\" and Hamilton's creation was quickly imitated on radio stations throughout America. KROQ and Dr. Drew Pinsky in Los Angeles gained the most notoriety where MTV Networks noticed it and produced A TV version of ‚ÄúLoveline‚Äù that ran on MTV from 1996 to 2000. Disney's \\"Hangin' With Hollywood\\" Mickey Mouse and Hamilton in 1992. From 1989 to 1992, every Sunday night, Hamilton produced and was the host of a live satellite radio show from Disneyland in Southern California. The four-hour show was called \\"Hangin' with Hollywood\\" and featured interviews with music, television and motion picture celebrities on the Tomorrowland main stage. This live radio show quickly became a Disney attraction for tourists who could watch celebrities being interviewed and participate by being \\"guest DJs\\", introducing the music on the air. However, because of Disney's strict rules and regulations regarding their image, the show came to an end in the winter of 1992. Hamilton remains an honorary citizen of Disneyland, an accolade that Mickey and friends personally presented to him on his birthday, March 25, 1989. WKTU New York City  In 1996, Clear Channel convinced Hamilton to relocate back to New York City to host a show for their WKTU evening slot. Hamilton brought a sidekick/comedian along by the name of Goumba Johnny, their chemistry earned them top ratings consistently for two years. Because of their overwhelming success, in September 2006 Clear Channel decided to promote the duo to WKTU's afternoon drive. In December 2010, with the departure of sidekick Goumba Johnny, Hamilton started hosting the afternoon drive-time show solo. Since then his show became not only the highest rated afternoon show in the New York metro area but currently also holds the highest rated share for all radio stations in New York.

Controversy  In March 1999 Hamilton was fired from WKTU after setting up the husband of a woman employed by him to win a station contest. Hamilton was guilty of \\"overzealousness in loyalty\\", David Katz, Hamilton's agent released at the time. \\"Sean was attempting to reward a employee who had done a lot for him and the station. This wasn't for personal gain, and he wasn't trying to cover anything up. He asked the station about it both before and after he did it\\". Hamilton was immediately suspended following the event and returned to WKTU in August 2006 where he remains employed today.

According to an April 1993 review of the book by Fred Magdoff, rural ghettos are often \\"omitted from most people's conception of poverty.\\" Generally, \\"rural poverty is less visually dramatic than urban poverty--poorly insulated mobile homes and weather-beaten single family houses look almost quaint compared to urban tenements.\\" Magdoff goes on to point out the reality of poverty in rural areas does not fit a common conception of idyllic farms. Some of the trends driving the rural ghetto phenomenon: * A speculation-driven bubble in land prices. * A push by agricultural officials to have farmers produce as much grain as possible, the \\"fencerow to fencerow\\" mandate. * The bank crisis, partially caused by banks pushing too-easy-to-get credit on both farm and non-farm businesses. * The decline in the number of non-farm jobs and the increase of low-paying service-sector jobs. * The opening of large malls on the outskirts of towns. * Reagan-era reduction in farm aid to states, cities and towns when aid was most needed. In contrast to urban areas and inner city neighborhoods, most of the \\"rural ghettos\\" are mostly white, though a large number of predominantly black towns in the Southern U.S. fit this particular profile. Jackson County, Kentucky in the Appalachia region was featured on an April 2009 segment on ABC news program 20/20 about rural poverty. https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=6845770 Also to note, many Indian Reservations, home to Native Americans such as Pine Ridge and Standing Rock, South Dakota, and Hispanic-majority farm towns known as colonias (see also barrio), most notably in South Texas and Central California, are referred to as \\"rural ghettos.\\" Often these areas are isolated geographically from main economic centers.

It lies about west of Devizes and northeast of the county town of Trowbridge. The parish includes the sub-village of Seend Cleeve and the hamlets of Inmarsh, Martinslade, Seend Head, Sells Green and The Stocks (the latter being contiguous with Seend Cleeve). Seend village is on a hilltop more than above sea level. The hill is bordered to the west and south by Semington Brook, a tributary of the River Avon, and to the east by Summerham Brook, which is a tributary of Semington Brook. The village's High Street is the A361 Trowbridge-Devizes road; the A365 links the A361 with Melksham and passes through Sells Green. Toponym The village name has had earlier forms, notably in the 17th century: Seene (1602‚Äî1635), Scene (1650), Seend Vulgo (1670) and Seen (1675). The name is from Old English \\"sende\\" meaning a sandy place.http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Wiltshire/Seend Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 does not mention a manor of Seend. In the 11th century Seend may have been part of the royal manor of Melksham. The earliest known record of the tenancy of the manor of Seend dates from 1190 when it was held by Wigan of Cherburgh. Wigan's descendants held the manor until 1297 when John of Cherburgh granted it to Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester. After Hugh was hanged in 1326, Seend was granted to Queen Isabella as part of her dower. In 1331 Seend manor was granted to Edward de Bohun, twin brother of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton. William and Edward were two of the younger sons of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford. Edward had died by 1337, when the Crown granted Seend manor to Hugh le Despencer, Baron le Despencer, subject to the life interest of Edward's widow Margaret. In 1341 Margaret died and livery of seisin was granted to Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford. After Humphrey's death in 1361, Seend was held successively by Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford until his death in 1373 and the 7th earl's widow until her death in 1419. In 1421 Seend Manor was granted to Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Stafford. In 1431 the countess placed the manor in trust for her nephew Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester. The Duke died heirless in 1447 and by 1461 Seend had passed to John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, a son of Anne of Gloucester's remarriage to William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu. John Bourchier's grandson John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners inherited Seend in 1447 and mortgaged it in 1506. The second Baron died in 1533 and his executors sold Seend manor to William Sharington of Lacock in 1539. William left Seend to his brother Henry in 1553, who left it to his daughter Grace and son-in-law Sir Anthony Mildmay in 1581. Mildmay died in 1617 and Grace in 1620, leaving Seend to their daughter Mary and son-in-law Francis Fane, who was created 1st Earl of Westmorland in 1624. Seend remained in the family until Charles Fane, 3rd Earl of Westmorland sold it to Sir Richard Blake in 1668. Sir Richard died in 1683 and his widow Elizabeth married Edward Hearst. They mortgaged Seend in 1690. After their deaths, Seend passed to Elizabeth and Sir Richard's daughter Mary, who was married to a Robert Dormer. Robert and Mary left Seend to their daughter Elizabeth and her husband John Fortescue Aland, who in 1746 was created Baron Fortescue of Credan in the Peerage of Ireland. The last known record of the manor dates from 1723. Parish church Seend was a chapelry of the ecclesiastical parish of Melksham by the latter part of the 13th century, when Hugh of Trowbridge had succeeded Ingram as capellano parochiali (\\"parish chaplain\\"). Seend had its own churchwardens from 1663, raised its own poor rate from 1734 but was not made a separate ecclesiastical parish until 1873. The Church of England parish church of the Holy Cross is built of rubble stone faced with ashlar. The oldest part may be the low west tower, which predates the late-15th-century Perpendicular Gothic nave. The Perpendicular Gothic north aisle is also late 15th century, paid for by the clothier John Stokes (died 1498). There are memorial brasses to Stokes and his wife in the north aisle. Over the chancel arch are traces of either a carved rood or a wall painting of the Crucifixion. Holy Cross has a west gallery that was built early in the 18th century. It bears two dates: 1706 and 1726. The chancel was rebuilt in 1876 to designs by the architect A. J. Style. The stone pulpit of 1884 is by Nathaniel Hitch. The font is Perpendicular Gothic; it was dug up and restored to the church in 1939. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1962. By 1553 the tower had three bells; it now has a ring of six. Four of the bells, including the treble, were cast in 1636 by Roger I Purdue of Bristol. The fifth bell was cast in 1793 by Robert and James Wells of Aldbourne. In 1880 Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the present tenor bell and recast one of Purdue's 1636 bells. In 1912 W. & J. Taylor of Loughborough recast Purdue's treble bell. Chapel There were both Quaker believers and Presbyterian ministers in the Seend area by about 1648. In 1672 Benjamin Rutty of Seend was licensed to be a Presbyterian teacher and to use his house for that purpose. By 1717 Seend had a congregation of 52 Presbyterians, to whom a minister from Devizes preached once a month. In 1749 John Wesley preached at Seend. Thereafter, non-conformist Christians in Seend seem to have become part of the Methodist movement. Construction of Seend Methodist Chapel began in 1774 and was completed in 1775; it was opened by John Wesley. The chapel was registered for marriages in 1854. The building is red brick with ashlar stone quoins and lancet windows in an Early English style grouped in pairs and triplets. It has been a Grade 2 listed building since 1981. As of 2016 the chapel is still in use. Secular buildings Weavers Cottages, Seend Seend Manor House was built in 1768 for the Awdry family. The house has two storeys, five bays, and an Ionic porch, and in 1962 was designated as Grade II* listed. Seend House, west of the parish church and also Grade II* listed, was built in the early 19th century. It is an ashlar- faced building of three storeys and six bays, with a porch of paired Tuscan columns. Two lodges are each fronted with four Tuscan columns. Hill Farm house in the High Street dates from the 15th century and has partly original timber framing including a cruck. It has brick nogging and a stone slate roof. Also on the High Street, Dial House has its origins in the 15th century with its ashlar chimney breast, but the rest is 18th-century red-brick facings. Moiety Manor is a 16th-century timber-framed and painted-brick farmhouse in Spout Lane. Seend Green House, near the east end of the village, was in existence before the end of the 17th century. It is a plain, ashlar-faced building of three storeys and seven bays. Its porch at the side with pairs of Tuscan columns was added slightly later. Economic history Farmland near Seend In 1666 the antiquarian John Aubrey observed an iron ore field at Seend and in 1684 he noted that Seend had a chalybeate well that attracted \\"much company\\". The ore field was evidently the source of the iron oxide in the chalybeate waters. A chalybeate spring at Seend was discovered or rediscovered in 1813. In 1815 a saline spring was discovered and a spa company was founded, which built a pump room and houses for visitors. The Spa prospered until 1822. The Kennet and Avon Canal was built between 1794 and 1810. It passes about north of Seend village and even closer to Seend Cleeve. The Great Western Railway opened the Devizes Branch Line in 1857, passing about north of Seend village, and in 1858 station was built to serve the area. was opened in 1909 at Sells Green, close to the north bank of the canal; the name was chosen because freight was expected to come from the horticultural area around Bromham. The line and stations were closed in 1966. The opening of the railway encouraged quarrying of the iron ore field, which began in the middle of the 19th century and continued intermittently for the next century or so. 77,984 tons of brown haematite were quarried between 1855 and 1861 and a further 86,443 tons between 1871 and 1874. Quarrying was renewed during the Second World War and was still continuing in 1950. Seend Ironstone Quarry and Road Cutting is now a Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. School Seend Church School was built by Thomas Bruges in 1832 and opened the following year. In 1859 a report criticised the schoolmaster and schoolmistress as uncertificated and the building as damp and unsatisfactory. In 1869 a Government grant paid for a new school building and by 1872 the school was receiving regular Government funding. Attendance grew from 77 in 1872 to 132 in 1893 and 108 children and 56 infants in 1910. Thereafter attendance declined to 68 children and 32 infants in 1938. There were 114 children of all ages in 1950. It is now Seend Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School.Seend CE VA Primary School Amenities The parish has three public houses: the Brewery Inn at Seend Cleeve, the Barge Inn at the canalside below Seend Cleeve, and the Three Magpies at Sells Green. In media The church parish (comprising Seend, Bulkington and Poulshot) was the subject of a television documentary series A Country Parish, shown in 2003 on BBC2.

It includes all the descendants of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln. There are ten known descendants of Lincoln. The family line is believed to have been extinct since its last undisputed descendant, Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, died on December 24, 1985, without any children. The Lincoln family does have other surviving relatives who share common ancestors with the former president. Three examples include actor George Clooney (related to Lincoln's birth mother Nancy Hanks Lincoln); LGBT activist Konrad Juengling, who descended from Lincoln's great- grandfather John Lincoln; and actor Ben Miller, who after doing research found a genealogical link to the Lincolns. Roots in England Samuel‚Äôs father Edward Lincoln was born about 1575 and remained in Hingham, Norfolk, England. He died on February 11, 1640 and was buried in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church. Edward was the only son of Richard Lincoln (buried 1620) and Elizabeth Remching. After the death of his wife, Richard married three more times. History =First generation= Samuel Lincoln House, built in Hingham, Massachusetts, by his grandson on land Samuel purchased in 1649 The Lincoln family arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1637, when Samuel Lincoln (1622‚Äì1690), the son of Edward Lincoln, sailed on the ship John & Dorothy from Great Yarmouth. He is considered as the patriarch of the Lincoln family in the United States.Waldo Lincoln, History of the Lincoln Family: An Account of the Descendants of Samuel Lincoln of Hingham, Massachusetts, 1637‚Äì1920 (1923) ; John George Nicolay, John Hay, Abraham Lincoln: A History (1890) p. 2. =Seventh generation= Lincoln and family. Abraham Lincoln (1809‚Äì1865) was a statesman and lawyer who became the 16th president of the United States from 1861 to 1865. He was born in a one-room log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks. He married Mary Ann Todd and had four children: Robert, Edward, Willie, and Tad.Donald, Lincoln, p. 84. =Tenth generation= Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith (1904‚Äì1985) was a gentleman farmer and great-grandson of Abraham Lincoln.

One child, called the leader or 'it', takes an object such as a button and goes around the circle, with their hands in everybody else's hands one by one. In one person's hands they drop the button, though they continue to put their hands in the others' so that no one knows where the button is except for the giver and receiver. The leader, or all the children in the circle, says \\"Button, button, who's got the button?\\" and then each child in the circle guesses. The child guessing replies with their choice, e.g. \\"Billy has the button!\\" Once the child with the button is finally guessed, that child is the one to distribute the button and start a new round. Alternate versions =Version 2= A second similar version has the child who is \\"it\\" stand in the center of the circle. The button is then passed behind the backs of the children in the circle, stopping at random. \\"It\\" tries to guess where the button is and once the button is found takes his or her place in the circle. Whoever had the button then becomes the new \\"it\\" and play begins again. =Version 3= A slight variation on the first two versions has \\"it\\" ask questions (like in the game Twenty Questions) to determine who has the button. =Version 4= Another version is usually played by several children with one adult. The game's origin is unknown, but it existed before 1900. The children start by sitting on the bottom stair of a staircase. The adult holds out both fists, one holding a button. The adult asks, \\"Button, button, who's got the button?\\" Whoever guesses correctly advances one step. The first one to reach the top step wins the game. If the staircase is not wide enough, the children can be divided up into teams. =Version 5= Buttony - a Murray Family Tradition, North East England, since the 1800s Two teams sit either side of a long table, with a \\"Team Captain\\" in the centre of each side. The button starts with the team captain of the active team, and the whole of the active team puts their hands under the table, towards the team captain. The team captain then puts the button into someone else's hand (or alternatively may choose to keep it). The button can exchange hands a couple of times, or may stay with the person the team captain chose. In the meantime, the other team chant \\"Button, Button, who's got the Button, 1, 2, 3\\". As the number 3 is counted, the active team put their hands onto the table in front of them, with their hands apart, and fists clenched (with the backs of their hands facing upwards). The opposing team then get one guess each to try guess who has the button, and in which hand (in theory a 50% chance). If they find the button, they get one point, and they become the active team. If they don't find the button, the person who has the button is revealed, the active team gets a point, and they stay the active team for another round. The team with the most points at the end of the game (either a set number of rounds, or when everyone agrees to finish), wins. Often there was a prize of an apple each, or a piece of chocolate each for the winners (which was often shared with the other team anyway).

Founded in 1988, Organic Valley is the nation‚Äôs largest farmer-owned organic cooperative and one of the world's largest organic consumer brands. Organic Valley markets products such as milk, cheese, eggs, soy, protein shakes, butter, yogurt, organic snack items, and more. Under the Organic Prairie brand, the cooperative markets organic beef, pork, chicken, and turkey products. With 1,800 farmer-owners across the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, Organic Valley markets its products in all 50 states and exports to 25 countries. Cooperative history Organic Valley's global headquarters, also known as \\"the modern barn\\" in Wisconsin with solar trackers in La Farge, Wisconsin Organic Valley was founded in 1988 under the name 'CROPP (Coulee Region Organic Produce Pool) Cooperative. What began as a group of Wisconsin family farms selling their produce soon expanded into the production and local distribution of vegetables, and dairy products. The brand name \\"Organic Valley\\" was soon adopted, and the abbreviation \\"CROPP\\" was adjusted to Cooperative Regions of Organic Producer Pools. The original CROPP farms were located throughout southwest Wisconsin, primarily in the Kickapoo River Basin area near the cooperative's headquarters which was built in 2004. Organic Valley comprises nearly 2,000 farmer-owners located in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom that specialize in sustainable, organic agriculture practices. Organic Valley has become the world's largest independent Cooperative of organic family farmers and one of the nation's largest producers and distributors of organic produce, dairy, soy, and eggs. It also markets its line of beef, pork, turkey, and chicken products under the Organic Prairie brand. Products are marketed in all 50 states, Canada, China, Japan, and 22 other countries. The United States is divided into three selling markets: the Western, Central, and Eastern Divisions. Each division is managed by sales staff, producers, and distributors directly associated with the cooperative. Organic Valley produces six regional milks that are produced, processed and distributed in New England, Northeast, Heartland, Rocky Mountain, California, and the Pacific Northwest. In 2009, Organic Valley launched a partnership with Stonyfield Farm and HP Hood agreeing to license the Stonyfield fluid milk brand, and manage sales and distribution. The deal also invited the farmers supplying that milk into the cooperative starting January 1, 2010.http://www.organicvalley.coop/newsroom/about-organic-valley/ In March 2016, construction was completed on a second 200,000 square foot office building on the Cashton campus in order to accommodate continued growth of the organization. The building is large enough to accommodate roughly half of the cooperative's total employees. Organic Valley's original headquarter building remains in La Farge, approximately twenty minutes east. Ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics, Organic Valley announced its sponsorship of Team USA cyclist Kristin Armstrong, one of the most decorated women cyclists in the world.http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/Whats-New/MilkPEP-Sponsors-Team-USA- and-Taps-Organic-Valley-to-Create-Special-Packaging/ The cooperative also created new packaging for its white milk half-gallons and Good to Go single- serves featuring the Milk Life Team USA logo. Organic Valley purchased Farmers Cooperative Creamery in McMinnville, Oregon 2016. It merges 72 co-op members in Oregon and Washington. In March 2017, Organic Valley announced the creation of Organic Valley Fresh, a 50:50 joint venture with Dean Foods to expand the brand's presence by leveraging Dean Foods' extensive distribution network. Later that year, the organization opened a new 23,000 square foot CALF (Conversion & Labeling Facility) building on the Cashton campus to accommodate growth of producing, cutting, packing, and labeling products. In 2019, total annual sales for Organic Valley reached an estimated $1.1 billion. However, milk supply and demand issues along with shifting consumer taste resulted in year-over-year profitability losses for the organization nearing $30 million in the latest 2019 earnings. Restructuring also led to a mixture of nearly 100 layoffs and retirements including the departure of 14 farmer-members.  Management  George Siemon, one of the founding farmers of CROPP, was the CEO of Organic Valley for more than 30 years.http://www.organicvalley.coop/about- us/our-cooperative/our-leaders/c-e-i-e-i-o/ Once a member of the National Organic Standards Board,Martin, Andrew. \\"How to Add Oomph to ‚ÄòOrganic‚Äô\\".

The new document, issued from Clinton's temporary headquarters at the Philipsburg Manor House in Westchester County, New York, proclaimed all slaves in the newly established United States belonging to American Patriots free, regardless of their willingness to fight for the British Crown. It further promised protection, freedom and land to any slaves who left their master. The move was one of desperation on the part of the British, who realized that the Revolution was not going in their favor. In a way it was too successful: so many slaves escaped (over 5,000 from Georgia alone), that Clinton ordered many to return to their masters. Following the war, about 3,000 former slaves were relocated to Nova Scotia, where they were known as Black Loyalists. Many continued on to Sierra Leone, where they established Freetown, its capital.

An ecoregion is defined by the WWF as a \\"large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities\\". There are terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecoregions. Ecoregions classified into biomes or major habitat types. Indonesia straddles two of the Earth's biogeographical realms, large-scale divisions of the Earth's surface based on the historic and evolutionary distribution patterns of plants and animals. Realms are subdivided into bioregions (and marine realms into provinces), which are in turn made up of multiple ecoregions. The Indomalayan realm extends across the western half of the archipelago, and the eastern half is in the Australasian realm. The Wallace Line, which runs between Borneo and Sulawesi, Bali and Lombok, is the dividing line. The portion of Indonesia west of the Wallace Line is known as the Sundaland bioregion, which also includes Malaysia and Brunei. When sea levels fell during the ice ages, the shallow Sunda Shelf was exposed, linking the Islands of Sundaland to the Asian continent. Sundaland has many large mammals of Asian origin, including rhinoceros, Asian Elephant, and apes. East of the Wallace Line lies the Wallacea bioregion, made up of islands that were never linked to a continent, but were instead pushed up by the Australian continent's northward movement. Wallacea is a transitional region between Asia and Australia. It has a flora of mostly Indomalayan origin, with elements from Australasia, with a reptile and bird fauna of mainly Australian origin and no large mammal fauna. The Aru Islands and the Indonesian portion of New Guinea are connected by the shallow Sahul Shelf to the Australian continent, and were connected by land during the ice ages. New Guinea has a flora of chiefly Asian origin with many Australasian elements, and a fauna similar to that of Australia.

Entrance to the cemetery The New Donskoy Cemetery (–ù–æ–≤–æ–µ –î–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –∫–ª–∞–¥–±–∏—â–µ) is a 20th-century necropolis sprawling to the south from the Donskoy Monastery in the south-west of Central Moscow. It has been closed for new burials since the 1980s.  History  The cemetery outside the monastery walls was established in 1910, when there was no more place for new burials inside the medieval monastery. The speaker of the first Russian parliament, Sergey Muromtsev, was among the first notables to be interred there. Maria Gartung, the daughter of Alexander Pushkin who served for Leo Tolstoy as a model for Anna Karenina, was buried in 1919.http://mosritual.ru/mesta-zahoronenija/donskoe-kladbische After the Russian Revolution, scores of Soviet soldiers killed during the Battle of Moscow and people executed by NKVD were secretly buried at the Donskoy Cemetery. It is believed that the mass graves from the era contain the remains of Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Pyotr Krasnov, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Isaac Babel, and other victims of Stalin's regime. The remains of painter Valentin Serov, composer Sergei Taneyev, and poet Vladimir Mayakovsky were exhumed and transferred to the more prestigious Novodevichy Cemetery. In 1927 the former church of St. Seraphim was rebuilt to become the first crematorium in Moscow. Most of the mortal remains buried at the New Donskoy Cemetery are therefore interred in urns. The church featured extended vaults which seemed suitable to accommodate the technical equipment for the cremation of bodies. The new crematorium was opened in October 1927 and most of the individuals buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis were cremated here. Until the mid-1970s the Donskoy crematorium remained the only one of its kind in Moscow. \\"Common Grave Number 1\\" \\"Common Grave Number 1\\" at Donskoye Cemetery In 1930, Bolshevik authorities dug a large pit in the east portion of the cemetery to act as a common grave for the cremated ashes of executed political prisoners from Joseph Stalin's Great Purge; the site was intentionally chosen for its isolation from normal burial sites due to its \\"shameful\\" history as Eastern Orthodox consecrated ground during the Tsarist era, which the Soviets had revoked as part of their general persecution of religion in the USSR. The ashes of numerous executed prisoners, both common and high-ranking‚Äîincluding notorious figures such as Nikolai Yezhov, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Grigory Kulik, Pavel Alexandrovich Alexandrov etc. ‚Äî were unceremoniously dumped here until the grave was filled and closed in 1942. The pit currently bears two markers, one erected during the Soviet era and simply reading \\"Common Grave Number One: Unclaimed Ashes from 1930-42.\\" while the other was erected after 1989 and reads \\"Here lie the remains of the innocent victims of political repressions in 1930-42 who were shot.

Fyn is a 59-kDa member of the Src family of kinases typically associated with T-cell and neuronal signaling in development and normal cell physiology. Disruptions in these signaling pathways often have implications in the formation of a variety of cancers. By definition as a proto-oncogene, Fyn codes for proteins that help regulate cell growth. Changes in its DNA sequence transform it into an oncogene that leads to the formation of a different protein with implications for normal cell regulation. Fyn is a member of the protein- tyrosine kinase oncogene family. It encodes a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the control of cell growth. The protein associates with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and interacts with the fyn-binding protein. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms exist.  History  Fyn is a member of the Src- family of kinases (SFK), the first proto-oncogene to be identified. The discovery of the Src-family in 1976 led to the Nobel prize for medicine in 1989 for J.M Bishop and E.M. Varmus. Fyn was first identified in 1986 as Syn or Slk through probes derived from v-yes and v-fgr. A common feature of SFKs is that they are commonly upregulated in cancers. Fyn is functionally distinct from its family members in that it interacts with FAK and paxillin (PXN) in the regulation of cell morphology and motility.  Function  Fyn is a protein, present in the signaling pathway of integrins, which activates ras. Fyn is a tyrosine-specific phospho-transferase that is a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases. (This family also includes Abl, Src, focal adhesion kinase and Janus kinase.) Fyn is located downstream of several cell surface receptors, commonly associated with neuronal development and T-cell signaling. When fyn is activated it causes downstream activation of molecular signals that drive processes crucial to growth and motility of cells. Fyn is primarily localized to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates tyrosine residues on key targets involved in a variety of different signaling pathways. Tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins by Fyn serves to either regulate target protein activity, and/or to generate a binding site on the target protein that recruits other signaling molecules. Fyn also is a tumor suppressor. When this normal biology is compromised, the altered Fyn becomes involved in the neoplastic transformation of normal cells to cancerous ones following the pathway from pre-invasive, to invasive, and ultimately metastasis. Role in signaling pathways An understanding of the role of fyn in normal biology is crucial to the understanding of its role in cancer, as cancer is the dysregulation of these normal pathways. Knowing which pathways involve Fyn will provide key insight for the development of potential pharmacologic agents to attenuate this uncontrolled signaling. At least three tools have been useful in discerning a requirement for Fyn function in a particular signaling system: * cells derived from Fyn-/- mice (as well as cells derived from Fyn, Src, Yes, Fyn triple knockout mice (SYF)); * a kinase-inactive, dominant negative mutant form of Fyn (K299M); * pharmacologic inhibitors of Src family kinases, such as PP2; note that PP2 also inhibits other tyrosine protein kinases such as Abl, PDGFR and c-Kit. Using these tools, a requirement for Fyn has been shown for the following signaling pathways: T and B cell receptor signaling, integrin-mediated signaling, growth factor and cytokine receptor signaling, platelet activation, ion channel function, cell adhesion, axon guidance, fertilization, entry into mitosis, and differentiation of natural killer cells, oligodendrocytes and keratinocytes. Fyn also has an important role to play in TLR-mediated immune responses from T cells.  Interactions  FYN has been shown to interact with: * ADD2, * BCAR1, * C-Raf, * CBLC, * CD36, * CD44, * CDH1, * CHRNA7, * CTNND1, * CBL, * CSF1R, * DLG4, * Dystroglycan, * EPHA8, * FYB, * FASLG, * GNB2L1, * GRIN2A, * ITK, * Janus kinase 2, * KHDRBS1, * Lck, * LKB1, * Nephrin, * PAG1, * PIK3R2, * PRKCQ, * PTK2B, * PTK2, * PTPRT * UNC119, * RICS, * SH2D1A, * SKAP1, * Syk, * TNK2, * TRPC6, * Tau protein, * TrkB, * TYK2, * TUBA3C, *WAS, and * ZAP-70,  Role in cancer biology  The Src family of kinases is commonly associated with its role in ‚Äúinvasion and tumor progression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and development of metastasis,‚Äù all hallmarks of cancer progression. Fyn‚Äôs normal function in cellular growth and proliferation has the potential to be exploited in the progression and metastasis of cancer cells. Overexpression of Fyn has been found to drive morphologic transformation in normal cells and increase ‚Äúanchorage-independent growth and prominent morphologic changes.‚Äù Fyn overexpression has been studied in relation to the following cancers: prostate cancer, glioblastoma multiform, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, pancreatic cancer, chronic melogenic leukemia, and melanoma. This overexpression triggers a promotion of ‚Äúanti-apoptotic activity of Akt‚Äù in prostate cancer, meaning that these cells have gained the ability to avoid the normal cell death pathways (a common hallmark of cancer). Additionally, in glioblastoma multiform, Src and Fyn have been found to be ‚Äúeffectors of oncogenic EGFR signaling‚Äù which has led to tumor invasion and cancer cell survival. Fyn‚Äôs normal role in cell migration and adhesion enables it to utilize the normal cell biology of integrin and FAK for cancer growth. Normal integrin is a cell surface receptor that interacts with the extracellular matrix to send signals influencing cell shape and motility. Normal FAK is a tyrosine kinase that gets recruited to focal adhesion sites and plays a key role in directed cell movement. These normal pathways plan a key role in ‚Äúmediation of Fyn transmitted cellular events impacting shape and motility.‚Äù A compromised version of this pathway would enable cancer cells to change shape and motility, increasing the possibility for advanced invasion and metastasis. Additional pathways under investigation regarding Fyn‚Äôs role in cancer progression include: the Rac and Rho family of GTPases, Ras, Erk, and MAPK. Because of this, Fyn has been a common target for anti-cancer therapeutic research. The inhibition of Fyn (like other SFKs) results in decreased cell growth. Furthermore, ‚Äúexpression of kinase-dead-Fyn (KD-Fyn), a specific competitor of endogenous Fyn,‚Äù was found to reduce the size of primary tumors in mice. Specifically targeting the unique identifying properties of Fyn as well as inhibiting FAK and PXN has the potential to create a very effective molecularly targeted combination cancer therapy. Fyn inhibitors are also being explored as potential therapies for Alzheimer's Disease.

It was printed in three parts. This work is regarded as one of the best written novels in India. First Part It describes the naive Parvateesam running away from home in Mogalthur, a small town that he calls a \\"famous historical city\\" in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, to become a barrister. The novel depicts the troubles he faced in dealing with other languages, and the naive way he behaves with people from the outside world. It ends with his reaching the shores of England. With the struggle for independence barely beginning in south India, Parvateesam decides to leave for England because of the way he is taunted by his teacher and friends; he thinks becoming a barrister is the only way to redeem himself. He runs away from home without much money. He knows no language other than Telugu and believes that once he reaches Madras (now Chennai, the capital city of then Madras State) he can take a ship to England. He knows nothing of the hardships of this journey. Second Part The second part begins with him reaching the shores of England. After spending a few days in London, he travels to Edinburgh in Scotland on the advice of a recent acquaintance to study at university there. He finds some students from India, who help him settle down and mingle with the local population. With the help of a tutor, he studies to pass the entrance exam to the University of Edinburgh. While making a fool of himself in several social situations, he learns the new culture and is impressed by the educational system. He dates a Scottish girl, a novel experience for him, coming from a totally traditional and conservative culture. He mingles as well with the local population as with the migrant Indian community. He learns to play golf well. He describes the situation in Scotland during the First World War. Even as war is raging, he finishes his studies to qualify as a Barrister-at-Law and returns to India. He is happy to return to his homeland. Third Part The third part begins with him reaching the shores of Bombay. Having grown accustomed to western culture over three years, he is baffled by the bureaucracy and lethargy of the Indian populace. He makes his way to his native village, much to the relief of his parents. Much to his embarrassment, he is feted by his high school and the local Bar association for having returned from a foreign land with an advanced education. He is stigmatized for having helped a married woman get into a bullock cart by holding her hand. He forgets for a moment that he is back in his traditional and conservative village where no form of physical contact is allowed between the opposite sexes. He gets married and starts to practice law in the Madras High Court, under the tutelage of a senior advocate. Gradually he comes into contact with freedom fighters, who are followers of Mahatma Gandhi. He also gets vexed with law practice. He participates in the freedom movement and goes to prison several times.

A plaque was installed in 2020 to memorialize Thurber, whose lynching took place on the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway (later becoming the Great Northern Railway) bridge over the Red River between Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota. Thurber was accused of raping two white women, one the wife of a railroad worker and the other described as a \\"Norwegian servant girl.\\" According to one of the illustrated North Dakota Mysteries and Oddities books, at least one of Thurber's accusers may have recanted her story. Accounts The lynching was described in the Daily Herald (which is now the Grand Forks Herald) in articles that are quite shocking to modern readers. For example, at one point the headline writer used poetry, as follows: Quiet and Peace Entirely Restored and with an Investigation no One will be Bored Public Opinion Carefully Sifted and Every One Rejoices that the Negro was lifted No Investigation Required and None Need Fear for Themselves in the Trouble being mired Thurber, the Negro Rapest [sic] Fell off the Bridge and was Hurt while Mr. Thomas COVERED HIM UP WITH RED RIVER DIRT. Racial expletives were used in headlines. According to the historical accounts that exist, a mob of citizens broke down the doors of the jail to abduct Thurber before any trial could take place. Some law enforcement members fought to prevent Thurber from being removed from the jail, but were reportedly overpowered. Rival mobs put two nooses on Thurber's neck and engaged in a tug-of-war there in the street. Thurber may have already been dead when he was lynched from the middle of a railroad bridge over the Red River. Burial A description of Thurber's burial comes from the Daily Herald. > \\"Mr O.M.

He is best known for the 1924 comedy novel, Barrister Parvateesam. Sastry has written many plays, short stories and essays besides his great work ‚ÄòBarrister Parvateesam‚Äô, though his name is generally associated with it. Sastry was skilled in multiple genres, but had a penchant for humour. It is the spirit of humour, in fact, that pervades the entire works of Sastry. There are six plays of his collected in one volume. Some of them bear traces of European descent, though all of them maintain the distinct touch of Sastry. ‚ÄòMrokkubadi‚Äô is a short one act play based on the belief that one can overcome any illness or danger by solemnly taking a vow to please the deity Venkateswara by offering to him everything possible. 'Abhyudayam‚Äô (Progress), another Sastry play, is similar to 'Mrokkubadi' in focusing our attention on the conflict between humanism. This play was composed in 1940 and the Great War provided the necessary impetus. ‚ÄòPedda Mamayya‚Äô is a play where we breathe the fresh air of romance, love, awe, and humour. Equally humorous is the ‚ÄòAsadharana Samavesamu‚Äô (The Extraordinary Meeting). This is yet another social satire breathing light humour and portraying the typical modern associations that dream of doing great things. 'Varasatvam‚Äô deals with the longing for a legacy. Dissatisfaction with what one has, goads the young Venkatarao to quarrel with his wife whose unmarried uncle has acquired a huge fortune. 'Pativratyam‚Äô is a short play dealing with the troubles of a young man brought upon modern lines. Here the conflict between the western and oriental civilizations is well depicted.

Plot At an anti- globalisation rally in New York City, a sniper called John Guyton ‚Äî who calls himself ‚ÄúThe Hand of The Voice‚Äù ‚Äî shoots a protestor, causing panic. However, his true target is soon revealed when he, along with a couple of allies, proceeds to gun down multiple reporters and camera crews who arrive to cover the story. All three, along with their fellow ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù and ‚Äúsisters‚Äù, are members of a revolutionary cult made up of individuals whose lives were destroyed when they were targets of sensationalistic, irresponsible and/or fraudulent media coverage, and all are determined to destroy the mainstream media under the guidance of The Voice, their messianic leader who communicates with them only by cassette tape. As more attacks on journalists occur, including the bombing of a bar frequented by reporters, high-ranking media moguls begin to pressure Senator Jay Rector, Chairman of the Senate FCC Oversight Committee, for increased protections for journalists. Their true motives, however, are more cynical; they want protect their organisation‚Äôs profits and abilities to continue with their reckless, profit-driven approaches to journalism in the face of a new threat and possible public discontent. Meanwhile, disgraced journalist James Andrews is approached by Guyton and recruited into the cult, and is gradually indoctrinated into their methods and motives until faced with his ultimate recruitment test ‚Äî murdering fellow journalist Warner Rogers, the New York Times reporter who broke the story of the journalistic fraud that ruined Andrews‚Äô life. Andrews shoots Rogers, but soon after overpowers Guyton and brings him to a cult deprogrammer; it is revealed that Andrews and Rogers had been working together after Andrews, learning of the cult‚Äôs existence, had decided to go undercover to expose them. In response to the attacks, Senator Rector has drafted legislation called the Freedom of Media Act, but in addition to increased protections for journalists informs the media moguls that they must accept either increased government oversight or weaker protections against liability for the stories they publish; the moguls, viewing it as a safer ‚Äúpublic- friendly‚Äù option with little teeth, choose the latter option. After being freed from his brainwashing, Guyton is overcome with remorse at his actions and agrees to go with Andrews to the police and confess what he has done. Before he can, however, he is intercepted by a limo owned by the Voice, leaving Andrews to face the police by himself. When Andrews‚Äô links to the cult are uncovered by the police, they accuse him of being the ringleader of the cult. As Rogers is dead and there is no other evidence that Andrews was undercover, Andrews realises that the cult has set him up as a fall guy. Guyton speaks to The Voice via speakerphone, who urges him to follow through with their plan; when Guyton resists, The Voice gives him the address of Elias Lee, the reporter who broke the story that ruined Guyton‚Äôs life. Guyton confronts Lee, who eventually admits that his main motivation for writing the story and destroying Guyton was for power, profit and because he could. Guyton kills Lee and decides to complete The Voice‚Äôs plan. A series of coordinated attacks on the media occur, killing all of the media moguls and several well- known journalists; Senator Rector, holding an interview with one of them, narrowly escapes death. During the attacks, most of the members of the cult are killed, including Guyton; no longer brainwashed, Guyton admits to himself before his death that he is no longer certain of the righteousness of his actions, but feels that he has at least done something to protect innocent people from experiencing what he did at the hands of the media. Following the attacks, the Freedom of Media Act is passed by the US Congress; however, the weakened liability protections have proved to be more damaging against the media than expected, as thousands have launched lawsuits against media organisations for unfair and unethical reporting. James Andrews has been convicted of being The Voice, despite his protestations of innocence. After his conviction, Senator Rector visits Andrews in prison and reveals that he is the Voice, and set Andrews up because he knew all along that Andrews was a reporter. Rector experienced an epiphany after a bout of late-life depression and decided to spend his remaining years destroying the institutions he thought were corrupting America, using weak and easily-manipulated victims of the media as his tools. Leaving Andrews in prison, Rector meets with the surviving members of the cult to plan a campaign against his next target ‚Äî lawyers.

Pathatrix was used in 2006, linking an E. coli O157 outbreak to contaminated spinach. The Pathatrix system is being used by regulatory agencies and food companies around the world to enhance their pathogen detection capabilities. Unlike other detection methods Pathatrix allows the entire pre-enriched sample or large pooled samples to be recirculated over antibody-coated paramagnetic beads. It can specifically isolate pathogens directly from food samples and in conjunction with quantitative PCR can provide results within hours. It is also used to improve the performance of other rapid methods such as PCR, lateral flow, ELISA and chromogenic media by reducing or eliminating the need for lengthy pre enrichment and/or selective enrichment steps. The Pathatrix is useful in pathogen labs that would be running food samples and looking for foodborne diseases. The Pathatrix is a rapid test method and Pathatrix pooling allows the screening of large numbers of food samples in a highly cost- effective way for specific pathogens such as E. coli O157, Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes. The Pathatrix will selectively bind and purify the target organism from a comprehensive range of complex food matrices (including raw ground beef, chocolate, peanut butter, leafy greens, spinach, tomatoes). The Pathatrix is the only microbial detection system that allows for the entire sample to be analyzed.  Pathatrix procedure  To perform a test using Pathatrix there are 4 major steps including sample preparation, pre- incubation, placing the sample in the Pathatrix, and washing and elution. Once the food samples are ready they are placed in the five independent incubation pots providing heat that makes the Pathatrix more sensitive for the detection of the target organism. Tubing, made of silicone rubber, is then connected to form a loop. Finally magnetic beads particles, coated with an antibody specific to the target pathogen, are added. The whole process runs for 180 minutes at a temperature between 30-37 degrees Celsius. After the incubation has taken place the target organism, now captured by the reagent, are now retained on the magnetic while unwanted debris is taken away. During the capture phase the microorganisms are removed from the system and further processed, otherwise colonies can be seen within as little as 16 hours.

The figure, approximately in height, is of a female Hindu or Buddhist deity, seated cross-legged and wearing a richly- adorned headdress and other ornaments on various parts of the body. It is now on display in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Since its discovery, the identity of the goddess represented by the gold statuette has been the subject of debate. Proposed identities of the gold figurine range from that of a Hindu Sivaite goddess to a Buddhist Tara. Recent scholarship suggests that the image represents the offering goddess VajralƒÅsyƒÅ of the Tantric Buddhist tradition. Identity H. Otley Beyer believed that the image was that of a Hindu Sivaite goddess, but with the religiously important hand signals improperly copied by local workmen. Thus it suggests that Hinduism was already in the Philippines before Ferdinand Magellan arrived, but also suggests that the early Filipinos had an imperfect version of Hinduism adopted from the Majapahit Empire. Natives back then were not converted into Hinduism, rather, they absorbed traditions in Hinduism while retaining their own indigenous Anitist religions. This golden Agusan image seems to be modelled after ‚Äî or copied ‚Äî the Nganjuk bronze images of early Majapahit period. Juan R. Francisco on the other hand found the conclusion of Beyer regarding the identity of the golden image as questionable. Specifically, he questioned Beyer's assumptions that: (1) \\"Butuan\\" means \\"phallus (the origin of the name \\"Butuan\\" is still under discussion); (2) that the king of Butuan, being not a Muslim, should therefore be a Hindu of the Saiva persuasion; (3) that the existence of other Sivaite images discovered among the Mandayas (south of where the Agusan image was discovered) and in Cebu should support his conclusions regarding the female Sivaite goddess identity of the golden statuette. Regarding the last assumption, Francisco pointed out that the identity of the other supposedly \\"Sivaite\\" images mentioned by Beyer (all of which were destroyed by the fire that consumed the Ateneo de Manila Museum in the early 1930s) is also questionable, since John Carroll, who examined a photograph of the Cebu image, believed that it is an \\"Avalokitesvara, not a Siva\\". Francisco, on the basis of the re-study of the gold statue, believed that it represents a Buddhist Tara. VajradhƒÅtu Mandala and unearthed in Nganjuk, Java. These figurines share stylistic similarities with the Agusan image. Another proposed identity of the Agusan image is the offering goddess VajralƒÅsyƒÅ, one of the four female deities located in the inner circle of a mandala called the Diamond Realm (VajradhƒÅtu). Mandalas like the Diamond Realm Mandala of Tantric Buddhism are elaborate diagrams that represent the cosmos in a metaphorical or symbolic manner. Mandalas can be represented as two- dimensional (either temporarily drawn on flat surfaces, painted on cloth, or etched on metal plates), as three-dimensional sculptural tableaux, or as large architectural constructions like the Borobudur in Central Java. Three- dimensional mandalas are thought to have been used for sacred rituals involving the offering of water, flowers, incense, lamps, unguents, etc. The Diamond Realm Mandala is one of the well-known and well-documented of the early Buddhist mandalas. Located at the center of such mandala is the Buddha Vairocana, surrounded by an inner circle of deities. The four cosmic Buddhas occupy the four cardinal points of the inner circle, each of which is surrounded by four attendants, while the four offering goddesses sit at the inner circle's four corners. The four inner goddesses associated with offerings made to the Buddha Vairocana are VajralƒÅsyƒÅ (\\"amorous dance\\", sitting at the southeast corner), VajramƒÅlƒÅ (\\"garland\\", sitting at the southwest), Vajragƒ´tƒÅ (\\"song\\", sitting at the northwest), and Vajram·πõtyƒÅ (\\"dance\\", sitting at the northeast). In the outer circle are sixteen further deities, four arranged along each of the four cardinal directions, while at the interstitial corners are four more \\"outer\\" offering goddesses. The outer circle is surrounded by 1000 more buddhas and 24 deities who guard the boundaries, while four guardian deities protect the four portals at the four cardinal directions. The Tibetan scholar Rob Linrothe was one of the first to recognize the Agusan image as VajralƒÅsyƒÅ, who is always shown with her hands on her hips. Florina Capistrano-Baker agrees with this conclusion, noting the similarities in style between the Agusan golden image and the other statuettes belonging to a three-dimensional Diamond Realm Mandala set such as the four bronze deities discovered in Nganjuk, Java (believed to represent the four offering goddesses of the outer circle). The shared characteristics between the Nganjuk figurines and the Agusan golden image were already suggested back then in 1920 by the Dutch scholar F. D. K. Bosch, however it was ignored at that time because no illustrations of the bronze figurines were presented. Recent scholarship is now re-evaluating the relationship between the Agusan golden image and the Nganjuk bronze deities as they are believed to have been made around the same time (10th-11th centuries). Identification of the gold figurine with the offering goddess VajralƒÅsyƒÅ also implies that it is but a singular part of a larger set of offering deities associated with the Diamond Realm mandala, the whereabouts of which remains unknown and are most likely lost in time. One of the factors that makes the identification of the image by scholars difficult is the fact that it has no specific iconographic attributes. The goldsmiths in the Philippines knew of Hindu and Buddhist artistic conventions, but did not include motifs which would identify them as specific deities. Philippine goldsmiths may have done this intentionally to maintain their ethnic identity. History In 1917, the Agusan image was found by a Manobo woman along the banks of the Wawa River near Esperanza, Agusan del Sur. She kept the artifact as a manika (doll) until it was acquired by the then Agusan Deputy Governor Blas Baklagon, after which it gained the name Buwawan ni Baklagon (Gold of Baklagon). However, according to Constancia Guiral, the granddaughter of the discoverer of the gold image, her grandmother named Belay Campos kept the item as a manika (doll) and later placed it on an altar for worship until it was stolen from their traditional Manobo house. It then ended up in the hands of Blas Baklagon. In 1918, Baklagon brought the artifact to the attention of Dr. H. Otley Beyer, who called it \\"the most spectacular single find yet made in Philippine archeology\\". Beyer, who was then the chair of the Department of Anthropology at the University of the Philippines and thus also serving as an honorary curator at the National Museum of the Philippines, attempted to convince the American colonial government in the Philippines to purchase the Agusan image for the National Museum of the Philippines in Manila. However, the government failed to purchase the artifact due to lack of funds. Ownership next passed to the Agusan Coconut Company to whom Blas Baklagon owed a debt. News of its existence eventually reached important people such as Louise Wood, whose husband Leonard Wood served as American governor-general in the Philippines. Fearing that the image might be melted down for its value in gold, Mrs. Wood conducted a fundraising campaign to collect funds for the purchase of the gold artifact. She enlisted the help of Fay-Cooper Cole, the curator of Chicago Field Museum's Southeast Asian department, together with Shaler Matthews, a professor at the University of Chicago, for the fundraising campaign. Their efforts paid off when the image was finally acquired for the museum in 1922 for ‚Ç±4,000.00. The image was then shipped to the United States in 1922 and was finally housed at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where it is still stored up to this day. Since the 21st century, the site in Agusan where the image was found has become a pilgrimage site for Buddhists and animists alike.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DThqfbARtY Recovery The artifact has been a source of conflict between Filipinos and Americans for many years, and many Filipino scholars have demanded its return. It is seen as a national treasure of the country, unreported during the time of its discovery, and sold to Americans during a period of national financial difficulty leading to the inability of the Philippine government to purchase the artifact when it was auctioned. Scholars have argued that if the reason the Field Museum took the artifact was due to fear of it may have been melted down, then the Field Museum should return it, or at least allow the Philippines to purchase back the artifact since the scenario that involves the image being melted down for its gold is unlikely.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6uaS8lcygw Also mentioned is how the artifact was bought by an American museum during a time when the Philippines was in financial duress and under the colonial government of America. One of the major advocates for the return of the Agusan image is former Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who made his last privilege speech specifically for the purpose of advocating for its repatriation to the Philippines. The Field Museum in Chicago has stated that it may return the golden image if it is \\"strongly requested\\" by the Philippine government. In April 2018, a documentary from GMA Network featured the Agusan image, this time showing the people of Agusan del Sur supporting the repatriation of the figurine. Scholars have also found a document proving the Philippines' right to claim the artifact. The scholars, in partnership with the government, have been tasked to pursue the Philippine claim on the golden image, which remains on display in the Field Museum in Chicago, United States.

The MMP2 gene is located on chromosome 16 at position 12.2.  Function  Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. This gene encodes an enzyme which degrades type IV collagen, the major structural component of basement membranes. The enzyme plays a role in endometrial menstrual breakdown, regulation of vascularization and the inflammatory response. The role of MMP2 in lymphangiogenesis was considered in a modelling and theoretical study; MMP2 degrades collagen I to switch on different patterning mechanisms for VEGFC.  Activation  Activation of MMP-2 requires proteolytic processing. A complex of membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP/MMP14) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 recruits pro-MMP 2 from the extracellular milieu to the cell surface. Activation then requires an active molecule of MT1-MMP and auto catalytic cleavage. Clustering of integrin chains promotes activation of MMP-2. Another factor that will support the activation of MMP-2 is cell-cell clustering. A wild-type activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is also required to activate MMP-2.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the MMP2 gene are associated with Torg-Winchester syndrome, multicentric osteolysis, arthritis syndrome, and possibly keloids. = Role of MMP-2 in chronic disease = Activity of MMP-2 relative to the other gelatinase (MMP-9) has been associated with severity of chronic airway diseases including Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and Bronchiectasis. In idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, MMP-2 activity was elevated in patients with the less severe disease phenotype which is more responsive and reversible with corticosteroid therapy. In non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, MMP-2 concentration was elevated in patients with Haemophilus influenzae airway infection compared to Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection. Bronchiectasis patients with P. aeruginosa infection have a more rapid decline in lung function. Altered expression and activity levels of MMPs have been strongly implicated in the progression and metastasis of many forms of cancer. Increased MMP-2 activity has also been linked with a poor prognosis in multiple forms of cancer including colorectal, melanoma, breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate. Furthermore, changes in MMP-2 activity can come from alterations in levels of transcription, MMP secretion, MMP activation, or MMP inhibition. MMP production in many cancers may be upregulated in surrounding stromal tissue rather than simply in the tumor lesion. For instance, Mook, et al. showed that MMP-2 mRNA levels are strikingly similar between metastatic and non-metastatic lesions in colorectal cancer, but metastatic cases are correlated with higher levels of MMP-2 mRNA in surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, it is difficult to fully understand the complex role of MMPs in cancer progression.  Role in cancer cell invasion  One of the major implications of MMPs in cancer progression is their role in ECM degradation, which allows cancer cells to migrate out of the primary tumor to form metastases. More specifically, MMP-2 (along with MMP-9) is capable of degrading type IV collagen, the most abundant component of the basement membrane. The basement membrane is important for maintaining tissue organization, providing structural support for cells, and influencing cell signaling and polarity. Degradation of the basement membrane is an essential step for the metastatic progression of most cancers. Cancer cell invasion, ECM degradation, and metastasis are highly linked with the presence of invadopodia, protrusive and adhesive structures on cancer cells. Invadopodia have been shown to concentrate MMPs (including MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and MMP-9) for localized release and activation. Furthermore, degradation products of MMP activity may further promote invadopodia formation and MMP activity. Finally, MMP-2 and several other MMPs have been shown to proteolytically activate TGF-Œ≤, which has been shown to promote epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process involved in cancer metastasis.  Role in cell signaling  MMP degradation of the ECM affects cellular behavior through changes in integrin-cell binding, by releasing growth factors harbored by the ECM, by generating ECM degradation products, and by revealing cryptic binding sites in ECM molecules. For instance, MMP-2 degradation of collagen type I can reveal a previously inaccessible cryptic binding site that binds with the Œ±vŒ≤3 integrin expressed by human melanoma cells. Signaling through this integrin is necessary for melanoma cell viability and growth in a collagen matrix and can potentially rescue the cells from apoptosis. As another example, cleavage of laminin-5, a component of the basement membrane, by MMP-2 has been shown to reveal a cryptic site inducing migration of breast epithelial cells. More generally, by degrading the ECM, MMPs release growth factors that were previously bound to the ECM, allowing them to bind with cell receptors and influence cell signaling. Furthermore, many MMPs also activate other proMMPs along with growth factors. MMP-2 has also been shown to cleave other non-ECM substrates including growth factors such as TGF-Œ≤, FGF receptor-1, proTNF, IL-1Œ≤ and various chemokines. For instance, MMP-2 has been implicated, along with MMP-9 in cleaving latent TGF-Œ≤, which has complex interactions with cancer cells. TGF-Œ≤ generally plays a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing tumor progression. However, genetically unstable cancer cells can often evade regulation by TGF-Œ≤ by altering TGF-Œ≤ receptors in downstream signaling processes. Furthermore, expression of TGF-Œ≤ is also correlated with immune tolerance and may help shield cancer cells from immune regulation.  Role in neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis  MMP-2 also plays an important role in the formation of new blood vessels within tumors, a process known as angiogenesis. This process is essential for tumor progression, because as tumors grow they need increasing supplies of oxygen and nutrients. Localized MMP-2 activity plays an important role in endothelial cell migration, a key feature of angiogenesis. Additionally, MMP-9 and other MMPs have been suggested to also play a complex, indirect role in angiogenesis by promoting VEGF mobilization and generating antiangiogenic factors. For instance, when studying carcinogenesis of pancreatic islets in transgenic mice, Bergers et al. showed that MMP-2 and MMP-9 were upregulated in angiogenic lesions and that the upregulation of these MMPs triggered the release of bioactive VEGF, a potent stimulator of angiogenesis. Additionally, the group determined that MMP-2 knockout mice showed decreased rates of tumor growth relative to tumor growth rates in wild type mice. Furthermore, increased expression and activity of MMP-2 has been tied to increased vascularization of lung carcinoma metastases in the central nervous system, which likely increases survival rate of these metastases. Finally, MMP-2 has been also shown to drive lymphangiogenesis, which is often excessive in tumor environments and can provide a route of metastasis for cancer cells. Detry, et al. showed that knocking down mmp2 in zebrafish prevented the formation of lymphatic vessels without altering angiogenesis, while MMP-2 inhibition slowed the migration of lymphatic endothelial cells and altered the morphology of new vessels. These results suggest that MMP-2 may alter tumor viability and invasion by regulating lymphangiogenesis in addition to angiogenesis.  Inhibition of MMP-2 as cancer therapy  Clinical trials for cancer therapies using MMP inhibitors have yielded generally unsuccessful results. These poor results are likely due to the fact that MMPs play complex roles in tissue formation and cancer progression, and indeed many MMPs have both pro and anti-tumorogenic properties. Furthermore, most clinical studies involve advanced stages of cancer, where MMP inhibitors are not particularly effective. Finally, there are no reliable biomarkers available for assessing the efficacy of MMP inhibitors and MMPs are not directly cytotoxic (so they do not cause tumor shrinkage), so it is difficult for researchers to determine whether the inhibitors have successfully reached their targets. However, initial clinical trials using broad spectrum MMP inhibitors did show some positive results. Phase I clinical trials showed that MMP inhibitors are generally safe with minimal adverse side effects. Additionally, trials with marimastat did show a slight increase in survival of patients with gastric or pancreatic cancer. Various research groups have already suggested many strategies for improving the effectiveness of MMP inhibitors in cancer treatment. First, highly specific MMP inhibitors could be used to target the functions of specific MMPs, which should allow doctors to increase the treatment dosage while minimizing adverse side effects. MMP inhibitors could also be administered along with cytotoxic agents or other proteinase inhibitors. Finally, MMP inhibitors could be used during earlier stages of cancer to prevent invasion and metastasis. Additionally, tumor overexpression of MMPs can be used to potentially target the release of chemotherapeutic agents specifically to tumor sites. For instance, cytotoxic agents or siRNA could be encapsulated in liposomes or viral vectors that only become activated upon proteolytic cleavage by a target MMP. Finally, the tumor-targeting properties of MMP inhibitors offer a potential strategy for identifying small tumors. Researchers could couple MMP inhibitors to imaging agents to help detect tumors before they spread. Though initial trials yielded disappointing results, MMP inhibitors offer significant potential for improving cancer treatment by slowing the process of cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

The film was directed by James Head with a screenplay by Matt Dorff, and stars Nicollette Sheridan, Judd Nelson, Alex McArthur, Debbe Dunning and Holland Taylor. Background The Ethel Lina White novel Some Must Watch was first offered on film in 1946 as The Spiral Staircase. This same title was used for a 1962 television adaptation, 1975 British TV-movie remake, and the 2000 made- for-cable feature. The 2000 version updated the original story to re-set from the early 20th century to present day. Filmed on locations in Vancouver and Victoria, Canada, the 2000 version was made for Fox Family network (now Freeform), as a remake of three previous films, still based on Ethel Lina White's novel, and using the same title as the previous films of 1946, 1962, and 1975. Synopsis The film centers around Helen Capel (Nicollette Sheridan), a pathologically mute woman who is being stalked by a vicious killer. Mute since the death of her parents when she was a child, Helen accepts a nursing position on a secluded island in the household of wealthy matriarch Emma Warren (Holland Taylor). Helen learns that a serial killer is picking off \\"imperfect\\" young girls around town, and she fears she is next. A terrible storm hits the island one night and the family and Helen are trapped inside... and they're not alone; the killer is with them in the shadows.

The original concept of Splashtop was that it was intended to be integrated on a read-only device and shipped with the hardware, rather than installed by the user. It did not prevent the installation of another operating system for dual booting. It was an instant-on commercial Linux distribution targeting PC motherboard vendors and other device manufacturers. The first OEM partner for the original Splashtop was ASUS, and their first joint product was called Express Gate. Later, other computer manufacturers also built Splashtop into certain models and re-branded it under different names. The aspects below detailing these events are retained verbatim from past articles, for historical reference. It boots in about 5 seconds, was thus marketed as \\"instant-on\\". It uses Bootsplash, SquashFS, Blackbox, SCIM, and the Linux kernel 2.6. Support for Splashtop OS has been withdrawn and downloads of Splashtop OS have been disabled on the Splashtop website. Features Splashtop features a graphical user interface, a web browser based on Mozilla Firefox 2.0 (later updated to Firefox 3.0), a Skype VoIP client, a chat client based on Pidgin, and a stripped-down file manager based on PCManFM. It also includes Adobe Flash Player 10. Splashtop OS shipping in HP, Dell, Lenovo, Acer, and other OEMs was based on Mozilla-based web browser. Google declined to be the search engine as Google did not want to revenue share on search traffic with DeviceVM. Despite Splashtop OS is Linux based, Splashtop closed partnership with Yahoo! and Microsoft Bing as search engines. After assessing Splashtop OS technology, Google decided to launch its own ChromeOS and Chromebook. The online downloadable version of Splashtop OS (beta) version 0.9.8.1 uses Microsoft Bing as search engine, a Chromium-based web browser with Adobe Flash Player plug-in preinstalled. Existing Windows bookmarks and Wi-Fi settings can be imported from Windows. Most versions of Asus motherboards no longer come with Splashtop preinstalled, as the manufacturer now limits the inclusion of its built-in Express Gate flash drive to \\"Premium\\" motherboards such as the P6T Deluxe and P7P55D-E Premium. Other Asus motherboards allow installation of the compact OS via a Windows-only based installer on its support CD. Installation from CD requires a Windows partition to store 500 MB of files, which has to be a SATA drive defined as IDE (no support for AHCI). If one doesn't have a Windows-based machine, it is possible to install Splashtop on a USB hard drive, from the sources. As of June 2010, Splashtop, as supplied for Asus motherboards, had no support for add-on wireless hardware such as PCI cards. Internals Splashtop can work with a 512 MB flash memory embedded on the PC motherboard.SplashTop's Instant- On Linux Desktop  Geek.com The flash memory can be also emulated on the Windows ' drive (see below). A proprietary core engine starts at the BIOS boot and loads a specialized Linux distribution called a Virtual Appliance Environment (VAE). While running this VAE, the user can launch Virtual Appliances (VA) or container. Skype is a VA or container, for instance.\\"Core Engine\\" slide by ASUS as reprinted in The Sony VAIO versions such as 1.3.4.3 are installed as VAIO Quick Web Access. The installer and the resulting SquashFS files occupy roughly 2√ó250 MB. The SquashFS files consist of a hidden and two hidden folders and in the Windows '-partition, where corresponds to for a DOS file system emulation of a USB flash drive. The MD5 checksums of the various Bootsplash xxxx and Virtual Appliance xxxx files (including a special Firefox configuration) are noted in for a simple integrity check at the Splashtop start. VAIO laptops offer special buttons ASSIST, WEB, or VAIO depending on the model. The power button on these laptops triggers an ordinary PC boot process, the WEB button starts Splashtop. If a Windows-version configured for VAIO is already running the WEB button only starts the default browser. The open sources used for major parts of different Splashtop versions can be downloaded. Parts of Splashtop are subject to patents. DeviceVM owns various patents around instant-on techniques, including being the first OS to leverage on-board Flash for enhanced performance, and intelligently cache hardware probing info so next boot will be faster.

ACEC) was a Belgian manufacturer of electrical generation, transmission, transport, lighting and industrial equipment, with origins dating to the late 19th century as a successor to the Soci√©t√© √âlectricit√© et Hydraulique founded by Julien Dulait. After World War II the company expanded into electronics, and became a contractor to the nuclear industry. The company was acquired by Westinghouse in 1970; in 1985 Westinghouse's share was acquired by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique (SGB) and Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Electricit√© (CGE). The company operated at a loss during the 1980s, and was split and sold; Alstom and its affiliates acquired the majority of the company, along with ABB and Alcatel Bell and others. The remnants of the company were merged into Union Mini√®re in 1989, forming ACEC Union Mini√®re. History =Background, 1878‚Äì1904= √âlectricit√© et Hydraulique advert (1897) In 1878 Julien Dulait (1855‚Äì1926), son of steelworks engineer Jules Dulait began experiments into electrical and hydraulic machines; with co-worker D√©sir√© Barras he created an electricity generating machine powered by an hydroelectric turbine. In 1881 the Compagnie g√©n√©rale d'Electricit√© was formed in Charleroi with Dulait as consulting engineer, constructing machines to Dulait's designs and those of Z√©nobe Gramme.Sources: In 1886 the company was renamed becoming Soci√©t√© anonyme √âlectricit√© et Hydraulique √† Charleroi (E&H;), by this time the factory was producing dynamos with over 100 kW power. By 1900 the company had supplied electric lighting to the cities of Liege, Charleroi and Schaerbeek, and opened a new factory in Marcinelle/Marchienne. In 1904 the company supplied trams for a line in Cointe, Liege- ‚Äì the first entirely Belgian built trams. The company's product range included dynamos, lifts, carbon arc lamps, electric traction motors for trams and drilling equipment. In 1898, the company established a factory in France in Jeumont (France/Belgium border).Sources: On 7 July 1904, the company became Ateliers de Constructions √©lectriques de Charleroi (ACEC), having been acquired by Baron Edouard Empain; Empain made an entry into the electrical industry in an attempt to counter German companies' share of the Belgian market. The Jeumont, France factory was renamed Ateliers de constructions √©lectriques du Nord et de l'Est (ACENE) in 1906; much later (1960s) becoming part of Jeumont Schneider. =ACEC, 1904‚Äì1970= After foundation in 1904 the company expanded in the next decade, establishing several new factories including ones for electrical cables, machine and tool making, and large scale machines. In 1914 the company began manufacturing motor vehicles, with an electric transmission system, to the design of Balachowsky & Caire. During World War I the factory was stripped of machines by occupying German forces. In the interwar period ACEC began to produce vacuum-based electronics, including mercury arc rectifiers ‚Äì in 1929 mercury-arc rectifiers were installed on Bruxelles tram system replacing rotary converters. The company also produced a high-power test installation, capable of producing 2.5GW in short circuit, with currents and voltages of up to 267kA and 250kV. In 1939 ACEC began to collaborate with Constructions Electriques de Belgique (CEB), with the two companies rationalising their combined production. During the buildup to World War II the factory was commissioned to manufacture 75mm anti-aircraft guns, 47mm antitank guns and other weapons, as well as variable-pitch propellers and parts for Hispano- Suiza aircraft. After the outbreak of war preparations were made to relocate the factories ‚Äì some production was restarted at a Hispano-Suiza factory near Tarbes, France. The Charleroi plant was initially taken under the control of the German armed forces. By 1942 raw materials, and manufactured parts and tools were beginning to become scarce, in 1942/2 workers at the plant began to be commandeered to work in factories in Germany mainly those of AEG, Siemens and Brown-Boveri. In 1947 the collaboration with CEB concluded with the two companies merging, forming ACEC Herstal. ACEC also acted as a contractor and equipment supplier to the nuclear industry, supplying sensor and handling systems including fuel rod handling, pumps for coolant systems and instrumentation, as well as conventional power plant equipment such as main generators, pumps, control systems, instrumentation and computer systems. In 1957, the company entered into a licensing arrangement with Westinghouse relating to PWR reactors. In the three decades after World War II the company also expanded into the electronics industry, starting to manufacture products including tape recorders, televisions, and radios. The Soci√©t√© Electro Meccanique (SEM) (Ghent) was absorbed in 1960/1. In 1970, it became a member of the Westinghouse group. Over the next two decades the company was restructured and its various operations sold off; much of the company was acquired by Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Electricit√© (CGE). =ACEC breakup, 1970‚Äì1989= The ACEC cable factory was split as a separate company c√¢blerie de Charleroi in 1971, and acquired by Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Electricit√© (CGE) in 1986, as of 2012 a factory in Charleroi is part of Nexans Benelux (Nexans group) and manufacturers medium and high voltage electric (up to 500kV) cable. Westinghouse reduced its shareholding to less than 50% by the late 1970s, In 1985 Inductotherm Industries acquired four induction heating businesses from ACEC, including Elphiac (Herstal, Belgium, joint company with Philips). The Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique (SGB) and Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Electricit√© (CGE) agreed to acquire Westinghouse's (42%) share in the company in 1985, becoming joint majority shareholders.Sources: The company restructured in the 1980s, reducing its workforce from over 5000 in 1985 to 2200 in 1998. The company reported losses of over 4 billion Belgian francs (BF) in 1986, and over 500million loss in 1987. In 1988 the company was still in very poor financial condition; in the first half of 1988 it lost 570million BF on revenues of nearly 4billion Belgian francs. The main shareholders of ACEC's owner SGB (Suez group and Carlo De Benedetti) announced that the company was to be sold. Many of the company's divisions were acquired by CGE subsidiaries (Alstom, Alcatel). Rail vehicle traction equipment manufacturer Kiepe Elektrik (acquired 1973) was sold to Alstom in 1988. The automation and energy divisions became majority owned by CGEE Alsthom (CGE subsidiary) as ACEC Automatisme SA, and ACEC Energie SA.Sources: The rail transport equipment subsidiary became a 100% owned subsidiary of Alsthom as ACEC Transport SA. in 1989; a plant in Herstal was closed, and traction motor manufacture ceased at Charleroi, moving to one of Alstom's French sites. ABB acquired ACEC's mechanical engineering facilities in Ghent in 1988, effective April 1989, forming ACEC Turbo Power Systems SA (ATPS). The steel construction business \\"ACEC construction soud√©e\\" was sold to Cassart (Fernelmont, Belgium). ACEC-SDT (space, defence, telecommunications) was merged into Alcatel-Bell (CGE majority owner, via Alcatel NV) forming Acatel-Bell-SDT. By June 1989, the SGB was the only remaining shareholder of ACEC, trading of shares was suspended on 5 July 1989, in July 1989 the remnants of the company, considered essentially valueless, with estimated liabilities of over 7billion BF were merged into the company Union Mini√®re, forming Acec-Union Mini√®re. =ACEC Union Mini√®re, 1989‚Äì1992= The information technology company ACEC-OSI was absorbed into Tractabel subsidiary Trasys in 1989. The pump machinery division was (ACEC centrifugal pumps) acquired (from ACEC Union Mini√®re) by BW/IP in 1992. BW/IP successor Flowserve closed the Charleroi pump factory in 1997. After the sale of the centrifugal pumps division, no significant parts of ACEC remained in the Union Mini√®re; it was renamed Umicore in 1992.

It is a basic shoot 'em up game in which the player controls a space ship that has upgradeable weapons. These upgrades are collected by destroying green transport vessels which release the upgrade for the player to pick up. Story An entire week of nuclear war on Earth destroys its global environment. The survivors of the war gather their strength and resources in an attempt to bring Earth back to the way it was. Using a super computer called God System, the survivors start their first step in rebuilding Earth by having the God System create machines capable cleaning and reconstructing much of what has been lost from the war. However, without warning, a mysterious mutant entity known as \\"N\\" takes over the God System; creating three strange guardian statues based on Greek mythological figures, N manipulates the God System's machines and programs in order to attack mankind. The survivors create an artificial human called Yukiwo ‚Äì built to harness perfect dexterity and strength ‚Äì as well as a super-powered jet for him to pilot in order to reclaim Earth from N. Weaponry The spaceship starts with a basic photon cannon and air-to-ground bombs. Both of these weapons can fire continuously without a need for pause. The photon cannon can be upgraded five times for up to five streams of photons by collecting P upgrades. Additionally, the exhaust of the ship can be used as a weapon. Special Weapons Special weapons can be collected by picking up boxes with specific labels through destroying transport vessels.

The state park encompasses multiple developed areas on over of land. In 2006, it was officially celebrated as Maryland's first state park and is managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. History ;20th century Formation of the park started with provisions in the Forestry Act of 1906. The completion of Bloede's Dam in 1906 required the implementation of protections to prevent silting from nearby farm erosion. Patapsco Valley State Park was established as Patapsco State Forest Reserve in 1907 to protect the valley's forest and water resources. The first 43 acres were donated by Russell Sage Foundation director John Mark Glenn (1858-1950) from his Hilton estate. In 1912, Maryland delegate Carville Benson promoted expanding the Patapsco Forest Reserve as a park to support his suburban development initiatives. As other sections along the river were added, Patapsco Valley State Park became one of the largest parks in Maryland. In 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps opened State Park Project 2 work camps 336 and 356 at the park. CCC workers created recreational facilities and performed tree plantings for erosion control and silt management around the dam from adjacent overworked farms. Keeping the shores and hillsides vegetated minimized erosion, thus minimizing the amount of silt that could clog the turbines of Bloede's Dam which generated electricity for surrounding communities. On May 15, 1941, the camp was converted to the nation's first Civilian Public Service conscientious objector camp, with 26 men and three women required to serve for one year, a term that was extended as the United States entered World War II. ;21st century In 2014, Howard County and Baltimore County approved the Patapsco Heritage Greenway, Inc. management plan for the Patapsco Heritage Area with includes a portion of the Patapsco Valley State Park. In 2015, 24.6 square miles which includes a portion of the Patapsco Valley State Park, was certified as the Maryland‚Äôs 13th Heritage Area by the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority. The Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club opposed the project out of concern of additional development on the valuable land, of which the Maryland Department of Natural Resources would be the approving authority. Activities and amenities The park's recreational opportunities include hiking, fishing, camping, canoeing, horseback riding, mountain biking, and picnicking. The Baltimore City Paper named the park as its \\"Best Place to Hike\\" in 2007. ;Park areas *McKeldin Area: The park's most western section features multi-use trails for horseback riding, mountain biking and hiking, a disc golf course, fishing at the confluence of the North and South branches of the Patapsco River, and the Rapids area on the South Branch. *Daniels Area: Once the site of a milltown called Daniels, the Daniels dam here backs up the Patapsco River providing smooth water for canoeing and kayaking, fishing, and swimming. Tunnel along Grist Mill Trail, Avalon Area. CSX Railroad runs above tunnel. *Hollofield Area: The park's center section features a 73-site campground, hiking trails, and shelters built by the CCC in the 1930s, plus a scenic overlook of the entire river valley. *Pickall Area: Picnic shelters and playgrounds. *Hilton Area: Located near Catonsville, the area has a small campground with mini- cabins, a nature center for children, tire playground, and access to the Saw Mill Branch Trail and other trails. *Avalon/Glen Artney/Orange Grove Flour Mill Area: The area features many historic sites including the Thomas Viaduct, the dismantled Bloede's Dam, the Old Gun Road Stone Arch Bridge, Orange Grove Flour Mill, and the Swinging Bridge. The Avalon Visitor Center (closed) is housed in a remnant of the milltown of the same name that once served the Avalon Nail and Iron Works. ;Swinging bridges There are two swinging bridges that cross the Patapsco River. The first spans the Patapsco at Orange Grove, northwest of Avalon following the Park Road in Howard County beyond shelters 104 and 105. Prior suspension foot bridges at this location enabled residents of the Orange Grove mill community to cross the river to Baltimore County to work in the five-storey-high Orange Grove Flour Mill of the C.A. Gambrill Manufacturing Company that burned to the ground in 1905. Visitors can cross the bridge to discover the ruins of the mill site that extended from the railroad tracks to the Swinging Bridge abutment. A second swinging bridge opened November 4, 2006. It is located at the end of the Grist Mill Trail and crosses the Patapsco River to connect with Ilchester Road. This new bridge allows easy entry for residents living in Ellicott City and Catonsville for the first time since Hurricane Agnes struck in 1972. ;Cascade Falls Cascade Falls is located in the Orange Grove area of the park. It gently descends a face and can be reached by way of a marked trail at the last parking lot in the Orange Grove area. In popular culture In 1999, final scenes of The Blair Witch Project were filmed in the Griggs House, a 200-year-old building located in the park near Granite, Maryland, that was subsequently demolished by the state despite film buffs' efforts to save it.

It was founded in 1845 by Ralph C. Whitsett, Sr. He and his family built a large red brick house in 1873,Whitsett Yearbook 1993 which still stands today. The community is made up of mostly ‚Äúcompany‚Äù houses that were built for workers that worked in a large coal mine located nearby, the mine was Banning #21. Most of the houses were ¬Ω houses built to accommodate two families. The mine has been closed since 1954 and most of the houses have been renovated and turned into single-family dwellings. History of coal mining The history of coal mining in Whitsett began on July 21, 1891, and would end in 1954; for a span of 63 years Whitsett was a coal mining town. Coal mining operations started in Whitsett in the summer of 1891; when the Luce-Whitsett Coal & Coke Company began mining coal and producing coke at Whitsett. The Luce-Whitsett Coal & Coke Company was owned and operated by Henry Luce, Albinus H. Whitsett, who was also its secretary; and David P. Whitsett, who was the mine superintendent. This partnership lasted from July 21, 1891 until November 16, 1892. This mine employed 126 men. The Luce-Whitsett Coal & Coke Company was sold to Frank M. Osborne of Cleveland, Ohio, for $7,277.86 on November 16, 1892. The coal mine then had its name changed to the Osborne, Saeger, and Company; it was in operation for five years. In 1897 Albinus H. Whitsett and his brother James E. Whitsett purchased the coal mine back from the Osborne, Saeger, and Company; they renamed the coal mine the Rainbow Coal Company. On November 18, 1901, the Rainbow Coal Company was sold to the Pennsylvania Mining Company, later called the Pittsburgh Coal Company. It was purchased from the Whitsett Family for $6,500.00. The Pennsylvania Mining Company/Pittsburgh Coal Company named the coal mine at Whitsett, PA - Banning #2. Banning #2 at Whitsett began mining coal in 1902. The company ceased operations on Friday, February 22, 1946, when a slate fall killed three of its miners. Those killed in the mine that day were Homer Young, 52, of Wickhaven, Andrew Vargo, Jr. 28, of Whitsett, and Henry Garner, Sr., 49, also of Whitsett. In 1948 the Robertson & Sheppard Coal Company began operations at Whitsett on a very limited scale; it was hand-picked coal. In the year 1954, that mine would also close operations, and it also marked the end of an era, when coal mining would play a major role in the village of Whitsett. In 1910 the Whitsett Mine (Banning #2), employed 659 miners, and produced 535,484 tons of coal - more than any of the other 18 coal mines located in the Youghiogheny River valley. Present day The Great Allegheny Passage runs through Whitsett, at the trailhead there is space for parking and trail access located at Weiss Memorial Park. There is also a basketball court, baseball field, playground and pavilions near the trail access. The trail was built on the old lines of the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie railroad. Whitsett was added to National Register of Historical Places in 1995.

Such a force may be held back to defend against attack from other enemy forces, to be committed to the existing battle if the enemy exposes a vulnerability, or to serve as relief for troops already fighting. Some of the different categories of military reserves are: tactical reserve, operational reserve, and strategic reserve. A military reserve is different from a military reserve force, which is a military organization composed of military personnel who maintain their military skills and readiness in a long-term part-time commitment to support their country if needed. Military reserve refers to specific trained pre-organized forces operating on an on-call basis from the main military force. Each member acts in combat as a regular soldier. Background The concept of reserve forces dates at least to early Roman legionary formations. In the early Roman legion, the soldiers were divided by wealth and age, with the poorer and younger Hastati forming the first line, followed by the Principes, and the wealthier and older Triarii. The first two lines were expected to do the majority of the fighting, with the third line held in reserve, both as a last resort and to deter routing. Reserves at various levels In the modern battlefield, reserves exist at all levels, from a platoon held back from a company level engagement, to whole army corps consisting of armoured and mechanised divisions which are held in reserve with the purpose of exploiting a breakthrough or containing an enemy advance. Typically what is a reserve for one headquarters is not the reserve for a higher headquarters (though depending on the setup they may be). So if one of a battalion's companies is held in reserve during a battle, the company is considered to be a reserve for the battalion but not for the brigade or the division, since it is committed to action in its parent battalion sector. Similarly the British Reserve Army of World War I and the American Fifteenth Army of World War II were only reserves in their theater, as far as the national Headquarters was concerned, they were committed since they were not available to be sent for action in any other theater. Employment Deciding when, where, and how to employ reserves is one of the most important choices a commander makes. Usually only a part of the reserves are utilised at any given time, since these are often sufficient to accomplish the task at hand. Committing the entire reserve at once - the \\"all reserves forward\\" order - is only considered in moments of extreme crisis, when it is clear the enemy will not be stopped otherwise. In the event of reserves being sent forward to exploit a breakthrough, some are typically held back to deal with a potential counterattack. Reserves can also be employed to relieve troops in action, allowing those units to rest and regroup away from the front line. Reserves may also exist in a broader sense: instead of being designated as the reserve in one tactical area, units and formations may be held back as forces available for responding to new strategic situations, or for fighting a decisive battle, as the battleship Yamato was. =Effect of reserves in history= Reserve troops‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîhave played a significant role in battles and campaigns throughout history, especially in the twentieth century. Nazi Germany deployed reserves from France and southern Europe to Tunisia, averting collapse in the wake of Operation Torch, and later to Italy, assuming control over most of that country after the Allied landing and the Italian surrender. Conversely, the lack of reserves to deal with the Allied landings in Sicily compelled the Germans to shift forces away from the Eastern Front, hampering the 1943 Kursk offensive, and the expenditure of their last reserves in the Battle of the Bulge contributed heavily to the general German collapse in 1945. In the aftermath of World War I, the extensive colonial commitments of the United Kingdom left few battalions available for the Anglo-Irish War, which hindered the British ability to deal with the crisis. At the Battle of Gaugamela, Alexander the Great held back his cavalry, using it first to deal with Persian flanking movements and later to exploit a gap in the enemy line and win the battle. Example of reserves There have been many examples of reserves formations throughout history. =British Reserve Army in World War I= The Reserve Army was a field army of the British Expeditionary Force during the First World War. Under the command of Lieutenant General Sir Hubert Gough, the Reserve Army was formed on 23 May 1916, prior to the Battle of the Somme, and was renamed the Fifth Army in October of that year. The intended purpose of the army was to carry out the breakthrough phase of the Somme offensive once General Sir Henry Rawlinson's Fourth Army had captured the German front-line trenches. For this role Gough was provided with the three British cavalry divisions and in June he was allocated an infantry corps of three divisions to support the advance. =Strike Corps= Some armor heavy formations of India and Pakistan are designated as \\"strike corps\\" to take advantage of breakthroughs.

It is considered a subspecies of Aethalops alecto by some authors. The Borneo fruit bat typically roosts in small groups in trees, under banana leaves, palm fronds and man-made structures. Taxonomy The Borneo fruit bat was described in 1938 by American zoologist Glover Morrill Allen. The holotype was collected in 1937 in Mount Kinabalu, Malaysia, which is on the island of Borneo. It was collected by J. Augustus Griswold, Jr. while on the Harvard Primate Expedition led by Harold Jefferson Coolidge Jr. The Borneo fruit bat has, at times, been considered a synonym of the pygmy fruit bat. As of 2019, the prevailing consensus is that the Borneo fruit bat is indeed a separate species. Description This bat is physically described as having reddish-brown fur with lighter coloring along the ventral side. The fur is longer along the back of the bat. It has a long, pointed snout. As one of the smallest of the Old World fruit bats, the Borneo fruit bat has a forearm length between 42mm and 46mm. Range and habitat The Borneo fruit bat is only found on the island of Borneo, where its range includes Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It is found in areas of high elevation, and has not been documented lower than above sea level. Conservation As of 2016, the Borneo fruit bat is listed as a least-concern species by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this classification because it has a large geographic range, across which it is relatively common.

Bush. Ana's Story is the account of a 17-year-old mother who was born with HIV. Bush met Ana, identified only by her first name, while an intern for UNICEF in Latin America. Because of discrimination against AIDS victims, some names and details in the story were altered to protect the subjects.  Contents  The book tells the story of Ana whose first memory is of learning that her baby sister has died. Ana's parents die of AIDS as well, and Ana is raised by an abusive grandmother whose boyfriend molested her. Ana learns at age 10 that she has HIV, but is told that it must be kept secret. By 17, Ana has a child of her own (HIV-negative) and is struggling to survive. The book consists of 102 chapters, some as short as a few sentences, and includes 49 pictures from Mia Baxter. The book also consists of 35 pages of information about UNICEF and AIDS-prevention.  Promotional tour  To promote the large printing, HarperCollins arranged a 25-city book tour for Bush. Bush also gave interviews to 20/20 with Diane Sawyer, The Washington Post and People Magazine. At Bush's first bookstore appearance in Annapolis, Maryland, a line formed at 9 a.m. for a 2 p.m. book signing. Bush has said that her share of the proceeds will be donated to UNICEF.  Bush and UN programs  Some critics have noted that Jenna Bush's father, President George W. Bush has had a relationship with the United Nations that many consider combative and criticized Jenna for not taking a stand on this issue. An example is that the Bush administration declined to fund the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which funds various HIV prevention programs on the grounds that the UNFPA has funded coercive abortions in China. Although the State Department disputed the allegation, the administration in fact has withheld $195 million in funds to the organization. Bush has generally declined to discuss her father's politics, though she did say \\"I'm not my dad,\\" and \\"I can tell you that UNICEF is doing incredible work.\\" One critic has noted that such statements could be considered \\"visiting the sins of the father on the daughter.\\"  References   External links  * Ana's Story on HarperCollins Web site.

History Augusta's commitment to care for the \\"sick poor\\" resulted in the building of a poor house and hospital on the 100 block of Greene Street in 1818. The first City Hospital provided local physicians an opportunity for medical education and became the first home of the Medical College of Georgia in 1829. While City Hospital generally served white patients, a Freedman's Hospital was opened to care for the many African-Americans who migrated to Augusta following the American Civil War. Augusta's City and Lamar hospitals (replacing Freedman's) operated under the auspices of local government, with medical and surgical control provided by medical college faculty. Nursing education was started at both hospitals in the 1890s, which would later evolve into the University Hospital School of Nursing. City and Lamar hospitals were brought under one facility with the opening of a replacement hospital in 1915, which was named \\"University\\" in recognition of the ongoing clinical association with the medical college. Having Barrett, Lamar and later Milton Antony and Jennings wings, the first University Hospital served Augusta's citizens for 55 years. Political upheaval caused the medical college to construct its own teaching facility, which opened as Talmadge Hospital in the 1950s. The Richmond County Hospital Authority moved to replace the aging University wings with a modern hospital, complete with coronary care and intensive care units, which opened in 1970. In 2017, University purchased Trinity Hospital, gaining a second campus now known as University Hospital Summerville, in the historic Summerville community.

He served in the US military, where he made a name for himself fighting under the name \\"Murray (Sugar) Cain.\\" Professional career Redtop's career as a professional boxer might not be believable, were it not so well-documented. He made his professional debut in February 1946 and initially fought at least once a month, sometimes twice. By the end of 1946 he had already amassed a dismal record of 1 win and 6 losses with 2 draws. Nevertheless, he kept plugging away, winning a few fights here and there so that by March 1947 he had been selected as an opponent for Sammy Angott, whose record was 82-23-7. He lost that fight by TKO in the 3rd round. Having begun his career in Ohio in 1947, Redtop made a move to the boxing hotspot of New England, where the quality of his opponents improved - as did his own performances. It wasn't long before Redtop was fighting the best boxers of his day, and not only that, winning with some regularity. In fact before 1948 was over, Redtop had fought the legendary Willie Pep twice - losing both bouts. In 1949 Redtop fought 54-1-3 Eddie Compo and according to Ring Magazine refused to do any punching until the state fight commissioner confronted him in the ring, whereupon Davis peppered Compo at will for two rounds before getting knocked out in the 8th. His purse for that fight was initially withheld, and its resolution is not known. Redtop continued to fight top-flight boxers for money and lower-flight pugs for wins, occasionally stringing together awful losing streaks and impressive winning streaks, and even occasionally pulling off a significant upset, as when he beat Elis Ask (record 31-5-2), Julie Kogon (record 81-37-17), George Dunn (record 33-7-3) and Paddy DeMarco (record 49-4-1) in a three-month period in 1950. Also, in 1952 Redtop put together a six-fight winning streak against a collection of opponents with a combined record of 133-47-5. And yet Redtop continued to pepper these impressive stretches with occasional, even frequent losses. Following another six-fight winning streak, this time against fighters with a combined record of 190-57-15, Redtop was given a shot at the legendary champion Sandy Saddler, whose record was an incredible 138-13-2. Saddler, it was written, \\"won as he pleased and it pleased him to cuff and belabor Davis and put him to rout in a bout that through the early rounds looked fairly even.\\" Following the Sadler bout, the good times seemed to end, and Redtop finished out his career with a stretch in which he only managed to win 8 out of 33 contests. At the end of Redtop's career, his record was tabulated as 68 wins (22 by knockout), 73 losses, and 5 draws in 146 contests.Teddy 'Redtop' Davis Along the way he fought a collection of small boxers that included Eddie Compo, Buddy Hayes, THE Weredonkey, Tommy Stenhouse, Rancor, Nick Stato, Miguel Acevedo, Willie Pep, Dennis Pat Brady, Harry LaSane, Charley Riley, Jackie Graves, Paddy DeMarco, Percy Bassett, Art Aragon, Corky Gonzalez, Arthur King, Federico Plummer, George Araujo, Tommy Collins, Tony DeMarco, Pat Mallane, Paul Jorgensen, Richie Howard, Kenny Lane, and a host of others with impressive records.

Gene  The human alpha globin gene cluster located on chromosome 16 spans about 30 kb and includes seven loci: 5'- zeta - pseudozeta - mu - pseudoalpha-1 - alpha-2 - alpha-1 - theta - 3'. The alpha-2 (HBA2) and alpha-1 (HBA1; this gene) coding sequences are identical. These genes differ slightly over the 5' untranslated regions and the introns, but they differ significantly over the 3' untranslated regions.  Protein  Two alpha chains plus two beta chains constitute HbA, which in normal adult life comprises about 97% of the total hemoglobin; alpha chains combine with delta chains to constitute HbA-2, which with fetal hemoglobin (HbF) makes up the remaining 3% of adult hemoglobin.  Clinical significance  Alpha thalassemias result from deletions of each of the alpha genes as well as deletions of both HBA2 and HBA1; some nondeletion alpha thalassemias have also been reported.

Van Horne's musical group, the Randy Van Horne Singers, performed the theme songs for many classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons including The Flintstones, Top Cat, The Jetsons, and The Huckleberry Hound Show. Early life Randy Van Horne was born on February 10, 1924, in El Paso, Texas. Van Horne dropped out of high school during World War II and enlisted in the United States Army. He returned to school after the war and attended the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, Maryland, and the University of Texas at El Paso to study music. Van Horne married his first wife, Tanya Ingwersen, in the mid-1950s. They had one son, Mark. The marriage ended in divorce. He married and divorced three more times during his life. Career Randy Van Horne's career began in the late 1940s as a Los Angeles studio musician. He formed his first musical group, the Encores, in the early 1950s with three other musicians. The Encores broke up in the late 1950s. He went on to create the Randy Van Horne Singers in the late 1950s following the breakup of the Encores. Several members of the Randy Van Horne Singers would eventually become successful solo recording artists, such as Marni Nixon. The group was known for its easy style of music and remained predominantly a studio musical group. However, the Randy Van Horne Singers did make occasional television performances, such as on The Nat King Cole Show in 1957. The group became most famous for recording the theme songs for several high-profile Hanna-Barbera cartoons, including The Flintstones and The Jetsons. They were hired by Hanna-Barbera's music composer, Hoyt Curtin, to complete the theme songs. However, the group also continued to record for commercials and radio station spots and jingles. Many of the jingles were written by Randy Van Horne. The Randy Van Horne Singers also recorded several albums including Other Worlds Other Sounds in 1958 with Juan Garcia Esquivel, a Latin musician famous for his \\"space age pop\\" style of music, and the winter-themed LP Sleighride (1960, Everest). The Randy Van Horne Singers officially disbanded in the early 1970s but Van Horne reincarnated the group after 2000, which is led by Alan Wilson as of 2018. Van Horne continued to perform in clubs in the Los Angeles area. He also worked as the bandleader of a group called the Alumni Association, which was made up of musicians from the Big Band era. Van Horne created a symphonic suite called The Running of the Bulls, which premiered at La Mirada Civic Theatre in 1981. Death Randy Van Horne died of cancer at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, on September 26, 2007, at the age of 83.

This might provide rationale for why Pennell and Cusack (1924), writers of a manual for teachers of reading activities, included letter writing in suggested instructional activities. Other important activities suggested in the Hosic report were expository writing, analysis of writing pieces, reports, literary composition, and debate. In 1917, the Hosic Report on the Reorganization of English in the Secondary Schools the first report to cite the relationship between speaking and writing, reported that the purpose of teaching composition was to enable the student to speak and write correctly to convince and interest the reader (Burrows, 1977). The first step was to cultivate sincerity through language; next to develop accuracy; and last to arouse artistic and individual expression. The goals focused on developing effective content and correct form including handwriting, spelling, grammar, capitals, and punctuation. Beyond these goals, importance was placed on enlarging vocabulary through reading. Reading authors with \\"concise and vigorous style\\" was encouraged so that the students could imitate \\"fine writing\\" (Burrows, 1977, p. 28). From the 1917 Hosic Report, the teacher was urged to focus on developing the individual writer rather than certain forms and rules. The teacher was to observe and respond to the maturing of each student‚Äôs growth in thought and expression. This sounds very much like teachers were being instructed to teach in response to the individual learner rather than just deliver a scripted program. Teachers were told to offer many opportunities for students to write and speak on topics that were familiar and of interest to them so that they could give attention to correctness and present thoughts to convince and interest others. The belief was that composition should grow out of the experiences of the child. The experiences included recent field trips and outside interests such as home activities and sports. Purpose and audience were stressed. In teaching composition, interesting content came first followed in importance by organization and then mechanics (punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, and word choice). The Hosic report stated that fact writing and imaginative writing came from two types of minds. It went on to say that short story writing should not be a passing standard for students but that they should be given opportunities to see if they had a talent for it. For those that did show talent and interest, special training should be provided. The same was advocated for debating. Teachers were encouraged to use pictures to stimulate writing development using newspaper editorial cartoons as examples. Authentic purposes for letter writing with students‚Äô interest as content were promoted. Letters by Stevenson, Dickens, Carroll, and Lincoln served as models for informal letter writing. Whose letters today would be excellent exemplars? The report mentioned that students who were clever at writing conversations which was a sign of character should have special training in dramatization and material for dramatizations could be used from local history. Smith (2002) reported that in 1920 (soon after this report) that suggestions for dramatizations followed longer stories in readers to support comprehension. Repeatedly, the Hosic Report stressed that the work should spring from the students' interests. It was after this report in the 1920s that Language Experience Charts based on children‚Äôs experiences were initiated. Reading material was developed by using students‚Äô own compositions about their firsthand experiences (Smith, 2002). It was also at this time that ability grouping, flexible promotions, differentiated assignments, and promoting individual progression were reported (Smith, 2002, p. 183). The emphasis in writing and reading instruction at this time seemed to be giving birth to differentiated instruction and responding to student interest. The 1917 Hosic Report proposed that composition activities should come from the life of the student and \\"develop in him the power to express his individual experiences\\" (Burrows, 1977, p. 32). Developing the skill of oral composition was also a strong emphasis in order to develop the power to think in front of an audience and find language for personal expression. James Hosic, author of this report, was an Emeritus professor at Teachers College, Columbia University as well as being the first Secretary (now Executive Director) of the National Council of Teachers of English from 1911 through 1920.

Born about 1429, or 1430 if later tradition can be believed, with strong connections to the burgh of Linlithgow, Fraser held a variety of high-level ecclesiastical positions in Scotland, including being the first Dean of Restalrig collegiate church (which he helped to found) before becoming Bishop of Ross in 1497, a position he held until his death in 1507. Early career Fraser was a university graduate, M. A., and he seems to have been the John Fraser who was Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of St Andrews in 1479.Dowden, Bishops, p. 222. He is found as Provost of the collegiate church of Abernethy on 2 February 1476; it is not known when he obtained this position, and the latest documentation of a previous provost occurs all the way back on 13 March 1445.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 342. He can be found as the Official of the diocese of Dunblane on 26 August 1476.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 92. He was litigating to gain the precentorship of Elgin Cathedral in 1480, although nothing more of this is heard.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 162. He is found as rector of the parish church of Douglas on 28 August 1481.Dowden, Bishops, p. 223. After the election of Robert Blackadder as Bishop of Aberdeen on 14 July 1480, Fraser received provision to the now vacant position of Archdeacon of Aberdeen; he did not secure the position because of the lack of royal support, but was still claiming the position in 1488.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 20. Collegiate church of Restalrig Fraser was the first Dean of the new collegiate church erected on 13 November 1487 at Restalrig in Midlothian.Dowden, Bishops, p. 222-3; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 369. Fraser petitioned the pope for the creation of the collegiate church on 6 May, to be dedicated to the \\"Holy and Indivisible Trinity\\" and the Virgin Mary; the church had and was benefiting from the patronage of King James III of Scotland, and the church was called at the time the \\"King's chapel\\" or \\"chapel royal\\".Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 224. Fraser founded a chaplaincy in the new collegiate church, to which he donated a tenement he had built in the Canongate.Dowden, Bishops, p. 223, n. 1. Bishop of Ross In the 1490s, Fraser became a royal councillor and Clerk of the Register. Some time before 10 September 1497, Fraser was elected through royal influence to the bishopric of Ross, vacant at least three, possibly five years, since the death of the previous bishop, John Guthrie.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 269. He received papal provision on 14 March 1498.Dowden, Bishops, p. 223; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 269. On 5 May, the Florentine clerk Ilarion de Portiis acting in Fraser's name paid the papacy 600 gold florins. His name appeared in Scottish sources datable to 3 December as \\"elect and confirmed of Ross.\\" He was granted the temporalities of the bishopric on 3 January 1499, by which time he had probably received consecration. On 10 March 1504, Bishop Fraser was present at a meeting of the parliament; on 10 May, he is recorded as granting his cathedral at Fortrose an annual rent of ¬£10 from a tenement he owned in the burgh of Linlithgow. On 15 September 1506, King James IV of Scotland, while at the Chanonry of Ross, granted to the bishop part of the lands of the toun of Arkbol, in the earldom of Ross. The History of the Frazers (Wardlaw MS) claimed that he died on 5 February 1507, aged 78. According to tradition one of the three funeral effigies in Fortrose Cathedral is that of Bishop Fraser.. The tradition ‚Äì attested in the Wardlaw MS History of the Frazers ‚Äì that he was Abbot of Melrose and Prior of Beauly is now thought to be spurious.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, pp. 18-9; see Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 190 for example of this being repeated; see Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, pp. 152-3, where Fraser is omitted from the list. Professor Donald Watt omitted him from his list of chancellors of Glasgow Cathedral, a position he was also widely believed to have held.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 160-3; see Dowden, Bishops, p. 222 and Keith, Historical Catalogue, both of whom alleged he was chancellor there.

It characterizes itself as a support network for practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism and a global Buddhist movement for \\"peace, education, and cultural exchange.\\" SGI is also a non-governmental organization (NGO) in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 1983. History The Soka Gakkai International (SGI) was formed at a world peace conference on January 26, 1975, on the island of Guam. Representatives from 51 countries attended the meeting and chose Daisaku Ikeda, who served as third president of the Japanese Buddhist organization Soka Gakkai, to become the SGI's founding president. The SGI was created in part as a new international peace movement, and its founding meeting was held in Guam in a symbolic gesture referencing Guam's history as the site of some of World War II's bloodiest battles, and proximity to Tinian Island, launching place of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. The Soka Gakkai's initial global expansion began after World War II, when some Soka Gakkai members married mostly American servicemen and moved away from Japan. Expansion efforts gained a further boost in 1960 when Daisaku Ikeda succeeded J≈çsei Toda as president of the Soka Gakkai. In the first year of his presidency, Ikeda visited the United States, Canada, and Brazil, and the Soka Gakkai's first American headquarters officially opened in Los Angeles in 1963. In 2000, Uruguay honored the 25th anniversary of the SGI's founding with a commemorative postage stamp. The stamp was issued on October 2, the anniversary of SGI President Ikeda's first overseas journey in 1960. In January 2015, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo reported that the SGI had been nominated for the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize, as confirmed by a Nobel Peace Laureate. In May 2015, the SGI-USA was one of the organizing groups for the first-ever Buddhist conference at the White House. In June 2015, the SGI-Italy was recognized by the Italian government with a special accord under Italian Constitution Article 8, acknowledging it as an official religion of Italy and eligible to receive direct taxpayer funding for its religious and social activities. It also recognizes the Soka Gakkai as a \\"Concordat\\" (It: \\"Intesa\\") that grants the religions status in \\"a special 'club' of denominations consulted by the government in certain occasions, allowed to appoint chaplains in the army a concordat is not needed for appointing chaplains in hospitals and jails and, perhaps more importantly, to be partially financed by taxpayers' money.\\" Eleven other religious denominations share this status. Organization The Soka Gakkai International comprises a global network of affiliated organizations. As of 2011, the SGI reported active national organizations in 192 countries and territories with a total of approximately 12 million members. The SGI is independent of the Soka Gakkai (the domestic Japanese organization), although both are headquartered in Tokyo. National SGI organizations operate autonomously and all affairs are conducted in the local language. Many national organizations are coordinated by groups such as a women's group, a men's group, and young women's and young men's groups. National organizations generally raise their own operational funds, although the SGI headquarters in Tokyo has awarded funding grants to smaller national organizations for projects such as land acquisition and the construction of new buildings. SGI- affiliated organizations outside Japan are forbidden to engage directly in politics.An SGI center in Chicago While the national organizations are run autonomously, the Tokyo headquarters of SGI disseminates doctrinal and teaching materials to all national organizations around the world. The Tokyo headquarters also serves as a meeting place for national leaders to come together and exchange information and ideas. The election or nomination of the leaders is typically not decided by the SGI's general membership but by a board of directors.http://constitution- sgic.org/PDFs/G3%20policy%20on%20leaders%20-%202014%2009%2027.PDF Governance Policy #3 - Leaders Leadership below national staff, however, has been liberalized; in the United States for instance, the nomination and approval of leaders includes both members and organizational leaders in the process. Dobbelaere notes the election of the presidents, as well as a process of \\"nomination, review and approval that involves both peers and leaders\\" in choosing other leaders. Beliefs and social engagement SGI members adhere to the philosophy of Nichiren Buddhism as interpreted and applied by the Soka Gakkai's first three presidents Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, Josei Toda and Daisaku Ikeda, incorporating social interaction and engagement into their Buddhist practice. Monthly neighborhood discussion meetings are generally held at the homes of SGI members. Soka Gakkai Malaysia since 2005 has held a non- competitive biennial \\"Run for Peace\\" to raise awareness of nuclear disarmament and in support of culture of peace in the community‚Äîreportedly \\"the largest peace run in the country held in 28 locations nationwide and involving some 115,000 runners.\\" In Dubai, the SGI Gulf association has hosted since 2008 an annual \\"Poetic Heart\\" symposium, partnering with other organizations and involving international and local artists as well as poets of all ages. Organizational practices in the United States have been characterized as socially inclusive Buddhism. In 2008, the SGI-USA, which is headquartered in California, publicly opposed that state's Proposition 8 (which sought to prevent same-sex marriage), and coordinated with other progressive religious groups to support same-sex couples' right to legally marry. In 2012, then- President of the Republic of China Ma Ying-jeou remarked that the Taiwan Soka Association had been recognized for its involvement the past 16 years in the general welfare of society, education and religious teaching, highlighting its disaster rescue and relief efforts in the wake of Typhoon Morakot in 2009. In November 2019, the Soka Gakkai Peace Committee in Japan helped organize the international conference \\"No Justice Without Life,\\" at which Mario Marazziti of the Italy-based Community of Sant'Egidio, among others, advocated for a moratorium on the death penalty. The Italian Buddhist Institute Soka Gakkai had earlier endorsed the Community of Sant'Egidio's international appeal \\"Moratorium 2000,\\" which was launched in 1998. Demographics The Soka Gakkai International is notable among Buddhist organizations for the racial and ethnic diversity of its members. It has been characterized as the world's largest and most ethnically diverse Buddhist group. Professor Susumu Shimazono suggested several reasons for this: the strongly felt needs of individuals in their daily lives, its solutions to discord in interpersonal relations, its practical teachings that offer concrete solutions for carrying on a stable social life, and its provision of a place where congenial company and a spirit of mutual support may be found. Peter Clarke wrote that the SGI appeals to non-Japanese in part because \\"no one is obliged to abandon their native culture or nationality in order to fully participate in the spiritual and cultural life of the movement.\\" In 2015, Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported that half of all Buddhists in Italy are SGI members. Initiatives promoting peace, culture and education According to Yoichi Kawada, director of the Tokyo-based Institute of Oriental Philosophy, the SGI defines itself as a \\"movement for contributing to peace, culture and education\\" based on its \\"interpretation and practical application of the ideas in the Lotus Sutra.\\" SGI engagement as a religious NGO affiliated with the United Nations in policy discussions on issues including human rights, sustainable development and peace building is similarly described, in the phrasing of its Charter, as contributing to peace, culture and education. =Nuclear disarmament= Since 2007, the SGI has collaborated closely with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) to develop educational programs and raise awareness on nuclear disarmament, particularly among young people. The SGI also partnered with ICAN to promote the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted at the United Nations in July 2017, and for which ICAN was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize. Beatrice Fihn, executive director of ICAN, stated in a July 2017 interview that the \\"SGI has been one of our greatest partners in the fight to abolish nuclear weapons.\\" To further increase public awareness of the anti-nuclear movement, the SGI also created \\"The People's Decade\\" campaign, which since 2007 has developed a global grassroots network of people dedicated to abolishing nuclear weapons. In 2014, an SGI youth delegation met with the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) regarding coordination of the SGI's efforts and the UN efforts to increase grassroots movements for nuclear abolition. In 2008, then-High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Sergio Duarte characterized SGI's work toward nuclear disarmament as linking human security with the fundamental goal of eliminating nuclear weapons. According to Pax Christi International, on March 28, 2017, a joint statement of Faith Communities Concerned about Nuclear Weapons, initiated by the SGI, was delivered by Pax Christi Philippines during the first UN negotiating conference for the treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons. More than 20 religious leaders affirmed through the joint statement their shared \\"aspirations for peace and for a world where people live without fear,\\" praising world leaders in attendance for \\"the courage to begin these negotiations\\" and calling on States not in attendance to join the June‚ÄìJuly session of the conference. =Environmental awareness= The SGI also promotes environmental initiatives through educational activities such as exhibitions, lectures and conferences, and more direct activities such as tree planting projects and the SGI's Amazon Ecological Conservation Center, which is administered by SGI-Brazil. The center is engaged in reforestation, the creation of a regional seed bank, and experiments in sustainable agroforestry. One scholar cites Daisaku Ikeda, SGI's president, describing such initiatives as a Buddhist-based impetus for direct public engagement in parallel with legal efforts to address environmental concerns. In India, the Bharat Soka Gakkai (the SGI of India) debuted the traveling exhibit \\"Seeds of Hope,\\" a joint initiative of the SGI and Earth Charter International. At the exhibit's opening in Panaji, the state capital of Goa, regional planning head Edgar Ribeiro spoke of lagging efforts to implement environmental laws and stated that \\"Only a people's movement can take sustainability forward.\\" In Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman University College President Datuk Dr Tan Chik Heok said that this exhibition helped \\"to create the awareness of the power of a single individual in bringing about waves of positive change to the environment, as well as the society.\\" In November 2015, the SGI signed on to the Buddhist Climate Change Statement representing \\"over a billion Buddhists worldwide\\" in a call to action submitted to world leaders at the 21st session of UN climate change talks held in Paris. The statement affirms that Buddhist spirituality compels environmental protection and expresses solidarity with Catholic and Muslim leaders who have taken a similar stance. Described as \\"one of the most unified calls by a religion's leadership,\\" the statement draws on the 2009 pan-Buddhist statement, \\"The Time to Act is Now: A Buddhist Declaration on Climate Change,\\" to which SGI-USA among others became a signatory in early 2015. =Aid work= The SGI conducts humanitarian aid projects in disaster- stricken regions. After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, local Soka Gakkai facilities became refugee shelters and distribution centers for relief supplies. Efforts also included worldwide fundraising for the victims, youth groups, and spiritual support. In 2014, SGI-Chile members collected supplies to deliver to emergency services and refugee centers after that country's devastating Iquique earthquake. =Interfaith dialogue= In 2015, SGI-USA was part of the organizing committee that convened a day-long conference in Washington, DC of 125 Buddhist leaders to discuss Buddhism and civic activism in the United States. The conference identified climate change and the environment, education and peace and disarmament as popular priorities.

Described by FBI Special Agent John E. Douglas as the most disturbing individual for whom he has ever created a criminal profile, Bittaker was sentenced to death for five murders on March 24, 1981, but died of natural causes while incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison in December 2019. Norris accepted a plea bargain whereby he agreed to testify against Bittaker and was sentenced to life imprisonment on May 7, 1980, with possibility of parole after serving 30 years. He died of natural causes at the California Medical Facility in February 2020. Bittaker and Norris became known as the \\"Tool Box Killers\\" because the majority of instruments used to torture and murder their victims, such as pliers, ice picks and sledgehammers, were items normally stored inside a household toolbox. Early life =Lawrence Bittaker= Lawrence Sigmund Bittaker was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 27, 1940, as the unwanted child of a couple who had chosen to not have children. Bittaker was placed in an orphanage by his natural mother and was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. George Bittaker as an infant. Bittaker's adoptive father worked in the aviation industry, which required the family to frequently move around the United States throughout his childhood. Bittaker was first arrested for shoplifting at the age of 12 and obtained a minor criminal record over the next four years after further arrests for the same offense‚Äîin addition to petty theft‚Äîwhich brought him to the attention of juvenile authorities. Bittaker would later claim these numerous theft-related offenses committed throughout his adolescence had been attempts to compensate for the lack of love he received from his parents. Although reported to have an IQ of 138, Bittaker considered school to be a tedious experience and dropped out of high school in 1957. By this stage in his adolescence, he and his adoptive parents were living in California. Within a year of dropping out, he had been arrested for car theft, a hit and run, and evading arrest. For these offenses he was imprisoned at the California Youth Authority, where he remained until he was 18 years old. Upon release, Bittaker discovered his adoptive parents had disowned him and had relocated to another state. He would never see his adoptive parents again. =Roy Norris= Roy Lewis Norris was born in Greeley, Colorado, on February 5, 1948. Norris was conceived out of wedlock; his parents had married to avoid the social stigma surrounding illegitimate birth at the time. Norris's extended family lived within a short distance of his parents' home due to his grandfather's real estate investments. His father worked in a scrapyard and his mother was a drug- addicted housewife. He occasionally lived with his parents throughout his childhood and adolescence but was repeatedly placed in the care of foster families throughout the state of Colorado. Norris's childhood recollections were interspersed with memories of wrongful accusations while living with his biological parents, and of being neglected by many of the foster families he lived with, frequently being denied sufficient food or clothing. He also claimed to have been sexually abused when in the care of a Hispanic family, later stating the prejudice he held towards Hispanic people originated from the neglect and abuse he endured as a child when placed in the care of this family. While living with his birth parents at the age of 16, Norris visited the home of a female relative who was in her early twenties and began speaking to her in a sexually suggestive manner. She ordered him to leave her house and informed Norris' father, who threatened to subject him to a beating. Norris subsequently stole his father's car and drove into the Rocky Mountains, where he attempted to commit suicide by injecting pure air into an artery in his arm. He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. Upon his return home, Norris' parents informed him that he and his younger sister were unwanted children and that they intended to divorce when both reached adolescence.The Serial Killer Letters p. 77 A year later, Norris dropped out of school and joined the United States Navy. He was stationed in San Diego in 1965 and was deployed to Vietnam in 1969, although he did not see active combat during his four-month tour of duty. He was honorably discharged from the Navy after one tour of duty.The Serial Killer Letters p. 66 First offenses =Bittaker= Within days of his parole from the California Youth Authority, Bittaker was arrested for transporting a stolen vehicle across state lines. In August 1959, Bittaker was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, to be served in the Oklahoma State Reformatory. He was later transferred to the medical center for federal prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, to serve the remainder of his sentence. In 1960, Bittaker was released from prison and soon reverted to crime. Within months of his release, he had been arrested in Los Angeles for robbery and, in May 1961, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. While incarcerated for this robbery, he was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as being highly manipulative. The psychiatrist also described Bittaker as \\"having considerable concealed hostility.\\" Bittaker was released on parole in 1963 after completing two years of his sentence. In October 1964, he was again imprisoned for parole violation. In 1966, Bittaker underwent further examinations by two independent psychiatrists, both of whom classified him as a borderline psychopath: a highly manipulative individual unable to acknowledge the consequences of his actions. Bittaker explained to one of them that his criminal activities gave him a feeling of self-importance, although he insisted circumstantial matters pertaining to his environment and upbringing decreased his ability to resist committing crimes. Bittaker was prescribed anti-psychotic medication. A year later, he was again released into society. A month after his parole in July 1967, Bittaker was again arrested and convicted of theft and of leaving the scene of an accident. He was sentenced to five years but was released in April 1970. In March 1971, Bittaker was again arrested for burglary. Due to repeated parole violations, he was sentenced to 6 months to 15 years' imprisonment in October 1971. Three years later, Bittaker was again released from prison. In 1974, Bittaker was arrested for assault with attempt to commit murder, after he stabbed a young supermarket employee who had accused him of stealing. The supermarket employee had observed Bittaker stealing a steak and had followed Bittaker outside and into the store's parking lot, where he asked Bittaker whether he had forgotten to pay. Bittaker responded by stabbing his pursuer in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. He attempted to flee but was quickly restrained by two other supermarket employees. The employee, Gary Louie, survived the stabbing, and Bittaker was convicted of the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weaponMindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit p. 174 and sent to California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. =Norris= In November 1969, Norris was arrested for his first known sexual offenses: he was charged with both rape and assault with attempt to commit rape. In the latter incident, he had attempted to force his way into the car of a lone woman. Three months later, in February 1970, Norris attempted to deceive a lone woman into allowing him to enter her home. When the woman refused, he attempted to break into her house; the woman phoned the police, who arrested Norris before he had the opportunity to cause the woman any harm. Less than three months after this offense, Norris was diagnosed by military psychologists with a severe schizoid personality. He was given an administrative discharge from the Navy under terms labeled as psychological problems. In May 1970, Norris‚Äîon bail for his latest offense‚Äîattacked a female student whom he had been stalking on the grounds of the San Diego State University campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to her knees before he repeatedly beat her head against the sidewalk as he knelt upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the Atascadero State Hospital, where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder p. 85 Norris was released from the Atascadero State Hospital in 1975, with five years' probation, having been declared by doctors as an individual who was of \\"no further danger to others\\". Just three months after his release, Norris approached a 27-year-old woman walking home from a restaurant in Redondo Beach and offered her a ride on his motorcycle. When she declined, Norris parked his motorcycle and grabbed the woman's scarf, twisting it around her neck, before informing her he intended to rape her and dragging her into nearby bushes. Fearing for her life, the woman did not resist the rape. Although the rape was reported to police, they were initially unable to find the perpetrator. However, one month later, the victim observed Norris's motorcycle and noted the license number, which she immediately gave to police. Norris was arrested for the rape; one year later, he was tried and convicted for this offense and sent to the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. While incarcerated at the California Men's Colony, Norris met and befriended Bittaker. Acquaintance California Men's Colony, where Bittaker and Norris first became acquainted, discovering a common interest in sexual violence. Bittaker and Norris initially became loosely acquainted in 1977, one year after Norris arrived at San Luis Obispo. Bittaker's initial impression of Norris upon his arrival at the California Men's Colony was that he was a savvy individual who largely associated with hardened criminals from motorcycle gangs, in addition to dealing in contraband drugs. The pair gradually became more closely acquainted and began talking in friendly terms when Norris taught Bittaker how to construct jewelry. According to Norris, Bittaker saved him from being attacked by fellow inmates on at least two occasions. By 1978, the pair had become close acquaintances; discovering they shared a common interest in sexual violence and misogyny, with Norris also divulging to Bittaker the biggest stimulation for him was of seeing frightened young women, adding this was the primary reason he had amassed a lengthy record for sexual offenses. Bittaker‚Äîwho is not known to have committed any sexual offenses prior to his meeting Norris‚Äîhimself divulged to Norris that if he ever raped a woman, he would kill her so as not to leave a witness to the crime. When alone, the pair regularly discussed plans to assault and murder teenage girls once they were freed. This shared fantasy evolved into an elaborate plan to murder one girl of each teenage year from 13 through 19. The pair vowed to become reacquainted once they were released.The Encyclopedia Of Serial Killers p. 60 Bittaker was released from the California Men's Colony on October 15, 1978; he returned to Los Angeles and found work as a skilled machinist. This work earned Bittaker close to $1,000 a week, and despite classifying himself as a loner, he became friendly with several people in his neighborhood, earning a reputation as a generous and helpful individual who occasionally donated money to The Salvation Army. On one occasion, he is known to have purchased large quantities of fast food and wine which he then handed to homeless individuals in Downtown Los Angeles. Bittaker was particularly popular amongst the local teenagers, and later admitted the primary reason he always had beer and marijuana in his Burbank motel was that his residence would remain a popular place for teenagers to socialize. Three months after Bittaker was released from the California Men's Colony, on January 15, 1979, Norris was released from prison and moved into his mother's home in Redondo Beach. He soon found employment as an electrician in Compton. Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from Bittaker. In late February, the pair met at a hotel and rekindled their plan to kidnap and rape girls. GMC Vandura model similar to this van when committing their abductions. In order for the pair to be able to successfully abduct teenage girls, Bittaker decided they would need a van as opposed to a car. With financial assistance from Norris, Bittaker purchased a silver 1977 GMC cargo van in February 1979. The vehicle was windowless on the sides and had a large passenger-side sliding door. According to Bittaker, when viewing this sliding door, he realized he or Norris could \\"pull up [to a teenage girl] real close and not have to open the doors all the way.\\" Bittaker and Norris would nickname this van \\"Murder Mac\\".Murders in the United States: Crimes, Killers and Victims of the Twentieth p. 160 Murders From February to June 1979, Bittaker and Norris picked up over 20 female hitchhikers. The pair did not assault these girls in any manner: these practice runs were merely a way for them to develop ruses to lure girls into the van voluntarily and of discovering secluded locations. In late April, the pair discovered a secluded fire road located in the San Gabriel Mountains. Bittaker broke the locked gate to this fire road with a crowbar and replaced the lock with one he owned. =Lucinda Lynn Schaefer= Bittaker and Norris killed their first victim, 16-year-old Lucinda Lynn Schaefer, on June 24, 1979. Schaefer was last seen leaving a Presbyterian Church meeting in Redondo Beach. In his written accounts of the events of this day, Bittaker stated he and Norris first finished constructing the bed the pair had installed in the rear of the van, beneath which they placed tools, clothes and a cooler filled with beer and soft drinks. At approximately 11 a.m., the pair drove to \\"the beach area, drinking beer, smoking grass and flirting with girls. We had no set routine.\\" Lucinda Lynn Schaefer. At approximately 7:46 p.m., Norris spotted Schaefer walking down a side street and remarked to Bittaker, \\"There's a cute little blonde.\\" After unsuccessfully attempting to entice Schaefer into their van with alternative offers of marijuana and a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's arms and legs and gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks. Despite initially screaming when she was abducted, Schaefer quickly regained her composure. In his written account of the night that followed, Bittaker wrote that Schaefer \\"displayed a magnificent state of self-control and composed acceptance of the conditions of which she had no control. She shed no tears, offered no resistance and expressed no great concern for her safety ... I guess she knew what was coming.\\" At the fire road, Norris first raped Schaefer after instructing Bittaker to \\"go take a walk\\" and return in one hour. Upon returning to the van, Bittaker similarly raped the girl in Norris's absence. Upon the second occasion in which she was raped by Norris in Bittaker's absence, Schaefer asked him whether they intended to kill her, to which Norris replied, \\"No.\\" In response, Schaefer requested to be allowed time to pray before she was killed if that was Bittaker and Norris's intention. In their subsequent accounts of the actual murder, Bittaker and Norris gave differing accounts as to who argued over whether they should kill her rather than release her: each stated the other argued that they should kill her. In any event, Schaefer pleaded for \\"only a second, to pray,\\" before Norris attempted to manually strangle her. After approximately 45 seconds, he became disturbed at \\"the look in her eyes\\" and ran to the front of the van, vomiting. Bittaker then manually strangled Schaefer until she collapsed to the ground and began convulsing. He then twisted a wire coat hanger around her neck with vise-grip pliers until Schaefer's convulsions ceased. Schaefer was denied her requests to pray before Bittaker and Norris killed her.Crime Classification Manual: A Standard System for Investigating and Classifying Violent Crime p. 134 Schaefer's body was wrapped in a plastic shower curtain and thrown over a steep canyon Bittaker had selected. According to Norris, after Bittaker had thrown Schaefer over the canyon, Bittaker assured him \\"the animals would eat her up, so there wouldn't be any evidence left.\\" =Andrea Joy Hall= On July 8, 1979, two weeks after the murder of Schaefer, Bittaker and Norris encountered 18-year-old Andrea Joy Hall hitchhiking along the Pacific Coast Highway. As the pair slowed the van to offer Hall a lift, another vehicle pulled over and offered Hall exactly that, which she accepted. Bittaker and Norris followed the vehicle from a distance until Hall exited the vehicle in Redondo Beach. On this occasion, Norris hid in the back of the van in order to dupe Hall into thinking Bittaker was alone. Inside the van, Bittaker offered Hall a cold drink from the cooler located in the rear of the van. Norris pounced on her when she went to retrieve it and, after a strenuous fight, managed to subdue Hall by twisting her arm behind her back, causing her to scream in pain. Norris then gagged Hall with adhesive tape and bound her wrists and ankles. Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a location in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris. While Bittaker was raping Hall for the second time, Norris saw what he believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Bittaker clasped his hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search for the vehicle he thought he had seen. When he returned, the pair drove to a location farther in the San Gabriel Mountains. Bittaker forced Hall to walk uphill naked alongside the road and to then perform oral sex on him, before ordering Hall to pose for several Polaroid pictures. Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a third location, where Bittaker again walked Hall up a nearby hill, this time as Norris drove to a nearby store to purchase alcohol. When Norris returned, Bittaker was alone and in possession of two further Polaroid pictures he had taken, both of which depicted Hall's face in expressions Norris later described as being of \\"sheer terror\\" as she begged for her life to be spared. Bittaker informed Norris that he had told Hall he was going to kill her and challenged her to give him as many reasons as she could come up with as to why she should be allowed to live, before thrusting an ice pick through her ear into her brain. He then turned her body over and thrust the ice pick into her other ear, stomping on it until the handle broke. Bittaker then strangled her before throwing her body off a cliff. =Jackie Doris Gilliam and Jacqueline Leah Lamp= On September 3, Bittaker and Norris observed two girls named Jackie Doris Gilliam and Jacqueline Leah Lamp sitting on a bus stop bench located close to Hermosa Beach. Lamp and Gilliam had been hitchhiking along the Pacific Coast Highway before Bittaker and Norris observed them as they were resting at the bus stop. Bittaker and Norris offered the girls a ride, which Gilliam and Lamp accepted. Inside the van, both girls were offered marijuana by Norris, which they accepted. Shortly after entering the van, both girls realized that Bittaker had steered the van off the Pacific Coast Highway and was driving in the direction of the San Gabriel Mountains. When the girls protested, both Bittaker and Norris attempted to allay the girls' concerns with excuses, which did not deceive either girl. Lamp, aged 13, attempted to open the sliding door, whereupon Norris hit her on the back of the head with a bag filled with lead weights, briefly knocking her unconscious, before overpowering 15-year- old Gilliam. As he began to bind and gag Gilliam, Lamp regained consciousness and again attempted to flee the van, whereupon Norris twisted her arm behind her back and dragged her back into the van. As this struggle ensued, Bittaker‚Äînoting the girls' struggle was in full view of potential witnesses‚Äîstopped the van, punched Gilliam in the face, and assisted Norris in finishing binding and gagging the two girls. Gilliam and Lamp were driven to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days, being bound and gagged between repeated instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also asked Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In the first of three instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed he buried the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an ice pick and using vise grip pliers to tear off part of one nipple. After almost two days of captivity, Lamp and Gilliam were murdered. At Bittaker's subsequent trial, Norris claimed he had suggested that Gilliam be killed quickly as, unlike Lamp, she had been largely cooperative throughout the period of her captivity, whereupon Bittaker replied, \\"No, they only die once anyway.\\" Gilliam was struck in each ear with an ice pick, then strangled to death. After Bittaker had murdered Gilliam, he then forced Lamp out of the van. Upon exiting the sliding door, Bittaker shouted to her: \\"You wanted to stay a virgin; now you can die a virgin!\\" before Norris struck her upon the head with a sledgehammer. Bittaker then strangled Lamp until he believed she had died; when Lamp opened her eyes, Norris again bludgeoned her repeatedly as Bittaker strangled her to death. The bodies of Gilliam and Lamp were thrown over an embankment into the chaparral. =Shirley Lynette Ledford= Bittaker and Norris abducted their final victim, 16-year-old Shirley Lynette Ledford, on October 31, 1979. Ledford was abducted as she stood outside a gas station, hitchhiking home from a Halloween party in the Sunland-Tujunga suburb of Los Angeles. Investigators believe Ledford accepted a ride home from Bittaker and Norris because she recognized Bittaker, as he is known to have frequented the restaurant in which Ledford held a part-time job as a waitress. Upon accepting the offer of a lift home and entering the van, Ledford was offered marijuana by Norris, which she refused. Bittaker drove the van to a secluded street, where Norris drew a knife, then bound and gagged Ledford with construction tape. Bittaker then traded places with Norris, who drove in an aimless manner for in excess of an hour as Bittaker remained with Ledford in the back of the van. After removing the construction tape from the girl's mouth and legs, Bittaker tormented Ledford: initially slapping and mocking her, then beating her with his fists as he repeatedly shouted for her to \\"say something\\", then, as Ledford began screaming, shouting for her to \\"scream louder\\". As Ledford continued screaming, Bittaker began asking her as he struck her: \\"What's the matter? Don't you like to scream?\\" As Ledford began to cry, she pleaded with Bittaker, saying, \\"No, don't touch me.\\" In response, Bittaker again ordered her to scream as loud as she wished, then began alternately striking her with a hammer, beating her breasts with his fists and torturing her with pliers both between and throughout instances when he raped and sodomized her. Repeatedly, Ledford can be heard pleading for the abuse to cease and making statements such as, \\"Oh no! No!\\" as sounds of Bittaker alternately extracting either the sledgehammer or the pliers from the toolbox can be heard on a tape recorder he had switched on after entering the rear of the van. Norris later described hearing \\"screams ... constant screams\\" emanating from the rear of the van as he drove. Shortly after Norris switched places with Bittaker, he himself switched on the tape recorder that Bittaker had used to record much of the time he had been in the rear of the van with Ledford. Norris first shouted for Ledford to: \\"Go ahead and scream or I'll make you scream.\\" In response, Ledford pleaded, \\"I'll scream if you stop hitting me,\\" then emitted several high-pitched screams as Norris encouraged her to continue until he ordered her to stop. Norris then reached for the sledgehammer as Shirley Ledford‚Äîseeing him do this‚Äîscreamed, \\"Oh no!\\" Norris then struck Ledford once upon the left elbow. In response, she informed Norris he had broken her elbow, before pleading, \\"Don't hit me again.\\" In response, Norris again raised the sledgehammer as Ledford repeatedly screamed, \\"No!\\" Norris then proceeded to strike Ledford 25 consecutive times upon the same elbow with the sledgehammer, before asking her, \\"What are you sniveling about?\\" as Ledford continuously screamed and wept. After approximately two hours of captivity, Norris killed Ledford by strangling her with a wire coat hanger, which he tightened with pliers. Ledford did not react much to the act of strangulation, although she died with her eyes open. Bittaker then opted to discard her body on a random lawn in order to view the reaction from the press. The pair drove to a randomly selected house in Sunland and discarded Ledford's body in a bed of ivy upon the front lawn. Ledford's body was found by a jogger the following morning. An autopsy revealed that, in addition to having been sexually violated, she had died of strangulation after receiving extensive blunt-force trauma to the face, head, breasts, and left elbow, with her olecranon sustaining multiple fractures. Her genitalia and rectum had been torn, caused in part by Bittaker having inserted pliers inside her body. In addition, her left hand bore a puncture wound and a finger on her right hand had been slashed. Bittaker would later claim the tape recording the pair had created of Ledford's clear abuse and torture offered nothing other than the evidence of a threesome, adding that, towards the very end, Shirley Ledford was screaming for him and Norris to kill her. Investigation In November 1979, Norris became reacquainted with a friend named Joseph Jackson, an individual with whom he had previously been incarcerated at the California Men's Colony. Norris confided in this individual as to his and Bittaker's exploits over the previous five months, including graphic details of the murder of Shirley Ledford (the only victim whose body had been found at this time). Norris also divulged to Jackson that, in addition to the five murders he and Bittaker had committed, there had been three additional incidents in which he and Bittaker had abducted or attempted to abduct young women who had either successfully escaped their attackers or, in one instance, had actually been raped but released. Upon hearing Norris's confessions, Jackson consulted his attorney, who advised him to inform authorities. Jackson agreed, and he and his attorney informed the Los Angeles Police Department, who in turn relayed the two men to the Hermosa Beach police. A Hermosa Beach Detective named Paul Bynum was assigned to investigate Jackson's claims as to Norris's confessions of the murders, attempted abductions, and rapes that he had confided to Jackson had occurred between June and October. Bynum initially noted that Jackson's statements as to Norris's confessions did match reports on file of several teenage girls who had been reported missing over the previous five months. In addition, the incident Norris had confided to Jackson where he claimed he and Bittaker had sprayed mace in the face of a woman, who had then been dragged into Bittaker's GMC van and raped by both men, matched a report filed in relation to an incident that occurred on September 30. In this filed report, a young woman named Robin Robeck had had mace sprayed in her face before being dragged into a van and raped by two Caucasian men in their mid-30s, before being released. Although Robeck had reported the abduction and rape to police, they had been unable to identify her assailants. Bynum dispatched an investigator to visit Robeck at her residence in Oregon, to show her a series of mug shots. Without hesitation, Robeck positively identified two photos presented to her as those of the men who had kidnapped and raped her on September 30. The two individuals she identified were Bittaker and Norris. Arrest Upon linking Bittaker and Norris to the rape of Robin Robeck, the Hermosa Beach police placed Norris under surveillance; within days, they had observed his dealing in marijuana. On November 20, 1979, Norris was arrested by the Hermosa Beach police for parole violation. The same day, at the Burbank motel where he resided, Bittaker was arrested for the rape of Robin Robeck. Although Robeck had been able to identify mug shots of Bittaker and Norris, in a police lineup she was unable to positively identify her assailants. Nonetheless, police had observed Norris dealing in marijuana, whereas Bittaker had been in possession of drugs at the time of his arrest. Both were held on charges of parole violation.Couples Who Kill: Profiles of Deviant Duos p. 30 A search of Bittaker's apartment revealed several Polaroid photographs which were determined as depicting Hall and Gilliam‚Äîboth of whom had been reported as missing earlier the same year. Inside Bittaker's van, investigators discovered a sledgehammer, a plastic bag filled with lead weights, a book detailing how to locate police radio frequencies, a jar of Vaseline, two necklaces (later confirmed as belonging to two of the victims), and a tape recording of a young woman in obvious distress, screaming and pleading for mercy while being tortured and sexually abused. The mother of Ledford‚Äînamed by Jackson as being one of the women whom Norris had confessed he and Bittaker had killed‚Äîidentified the voice on the tape as being that of her only daughter; the voices of the two men mocking and threatening Ledford in the process of her torture and abuse were identified as being Roy Norris and Lawrence Bittaker. Also found in Bittaker's motel were seven bottles of various acidic materials. (Investigators would later discover Bittaker planned to use these acidic materials upon their next victim.) Inside Norris's apartment, police discovered a bracelet he had taken from Ledford's body as a souvenir. Also found at the homes of both Bittaker and Norris were Polaroid pictures of almost 500 teenage girls and young women, most of which had apparently been taken at Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, with others taken by Bittaker at a Burbank high school. Most of these pictures had been taken without the girls' knowledge or consent. =Confession= On November 30, 1979, Norris attended a preliminary hearing in relation to the September 30 rape. By this stage, Norris was beginning to display visible signs of stress. At the hearing, Norris waived his Miranda rights before Detective Bynum and Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay began questioning him, initially in relation to the rape of Robin Robeck, then in relation to the statements given to police by Joseph Jackson and the evidence recovered from his and Bittaker's residences. Initially, Norris flatly denied any involvement in any murders, rapes or disappearances; however, when confronted with the evidence investigators had compiled, Norris began to confess, although he did attempt to portray Bittaker as being more culpable in the murders than himself. In what Bynum and Kay later described as a \\"casual, unconcerned manner,\\" Norris divulged that he and Bittaker had been in the habit of driving around areas such as the Pacific Coast Highway and randomly approaching girls whom they found attractive with offers of a ride, posing with the pair for photographs, or marijuana. Most of those whom they approached rejected whatever given ruse Bittaker and Norris used to entice them into the van, although four girls had accepted lifts from the pair and had been murdered, with a fifth victim‚Äîtheir first‚Äîbeing grabbed by force. Inside the van, the girls would typically be overpowered, bound hand and foot, gagged, and driven to locations deep within the San Gabriel Mountains, where they would be sexually assaulted by both men, then usually killed by strangulation with a wire coat hanger, although two of the victims had had ice picks driven into their ears before being strangled. Norris admitted to bludgeoning their youngest victim, Lamp, about the head with a sledgehammer as Bittaker strangled her, and admitted to repeatedly striking Shirley Ledford upon the elbow with a sledgehammer before strangling her to death. The bottles of acid found at Bittaker's motel, Norris stated, were intended for use upon the next victim they abducted, and the acts of torture and humiliation had been committed against their victims \\"for fun\\".Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit p. 184 According to Norris, the level of brutality Bittaker had exhibited toward their victims had increased on each successive instance they had successfully lured a girl into the van; their final victim, Ledford, had actually pleaded to be killed in order that her agony could cease. Additional details by Norris provided further corroborating evidence to support his confessions. For example, he knew that their first victim, Schaefer, had left a meeting at a Presbyterian Church shortly before she was abducted and that Schaefer had lost one shoe as she had been dragged into Bittaker's van. Norris also knew part of Shirley Ledford's ancestry was Hispanic, and that Bittaker had unsuccessfully asked her to date him prior to October 1979. In a press statement relating to the police investigation into the murders issued on February 7, 1980, Los Angeles County Sheriff Peter Pitchess stated the victims had been subjected to \\"sadistic and barbaric abuse,\\" adding that five charges of first-degree murder would be sought against both Bittaker and Norris. Sheriff Pitchess also stated that, in relation to the Polaroid pictures found in Bittaker and Norris's apartments, police had located 60 of the young women depicted‚Äînone of whom had been harmed. Nonetheless, Pitchess also stated that police had also identified 19 of the women depicted in the pictures as being individuals who had been reported missing,The Great Pictorial History of World Crime, Volume 2 p. 718 and that these teenage girls and young women may well have been murdered, although Pitchess did stress that they had no conclusive evidence to suggest that these additional 19 women photographed had fallen victim to Bittaker and Norris. One of the individuals depicted in the Polaroid pictures seized from Bittaker and Norris depicts an unidentified young white woman, alone with Bittaker and Norris, in circumstances very similar to the pictures found depicting known victims Hall, Lamp, and Gilliam. The young woman in the pictures has never been identified. This photograph is indicative there may have been one further victim whom neither Bittaker or Norris ever mentioned to investigators. =Search of San Gabriel Mountains= The San Gabriel Mountains. Bittaker and Norris murdered and discarded the bodies of four of their victims at this location. Norris was able to lead investigators to the bodies of two of the four victims he and Bittaker had murdered at this location. Norris agreed to return to the San Gabriel Mountains to search for the bodies of the girls to whose abduction and murder he had confessed to assisting in. In each instance, Norris brought detectives to the area where he and Bittaker had disposed of their victims' bodies. Despite extensive searches of the areas where he stated the bodies of Schaefer and Hall had been discarded, their bodies were never found. On February 9, 1980, the skeletalized bodies of Lamp and Gilliam were found at the bottom of a canyon, alongside a dry river bed. The bodies were scattered over an area measuring hundreds of feet in diameter. An ice pick was still lodged in the skull of Gilliam; the skull of Lamp bore multiple indentations‚Äîevidence of the numerous hammer blows Norris had stated he inflicted.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers pp. 21‚Äì22 In February 1980, Norris and Bittaker were formally charged with the murders of the five girls. At the arraignment, Bittaker was denied bail, whereas Norris's bail was set at $10,000. Within one month of his being charged with murder, Norris had accepted a plea bargain in which he would testify against Bittaker in return for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty against him. Guilty plea On March 18, 1980, Norris pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder, one count of second- degree murder (in relation to victim Hall), two counts of rape, and one count of robbery. Formal sentencing was postponed until May 7. In return for Norris's agreeing to plead guilty and to testify against Bittaker, prosecutors had agreed to seek neither the death penalty nor life without parole at the upcoming sentencing hearing. Prior to his May 7 sentencing, Norris was reviewed by a probation officer who testified at his sentencing that Norris had again accused Bittaker of the actual torture of their victims, and that for Norris himself, the feeling of power and the dominance he had over the victims was the main overriding factor, as opposed to having sexual intercourse with them. The probation officer added that Norris \\"never exhibited any remorse or compassion about his brutal acts towards the victims ... the defendant appears compulsive in his need to inflict pain and torture upon women.\\" In conclusion, the probation officer testified that Norris \\"can realistically be regarded as an extreme sociopath, whose depraved pattern of behavior is beyond rehabilitation.\\" On May 7, 1980, Norris was sentenced to 45 years to life imprisonment, with eligibility for parole from 2010.The Encyclopedia Of Serial Killers p. 61 =Arraignment= On April 24, 1980, Bittaker was arraigned on a total of 29 charges of kidnapping, rape, sodomy, and murder in addition to various charges of criminal conspiracy and possession of a firearm. He was also charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder dating from December 1979 in which he had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade two inmates due to be released to murder Robin Robeck in order to prevent her from testifying against him at his upcoming trial. The charges for the rape of Robin Robeck would later be dropped because of a lack of physical evidence as well as Robeck's failing to identify her attackers in a lineup. When asked by Judge William Hollingsworth as to how he pleaded, Bittaker remained silent‚Äîrefusing to answer any questions. In response, the judge entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Trial Bittaker's trial began on January 19, 1981. He was tried in Torrance before Judge Thomas Fredericks. The star witness to appear for the prosecution at the trial of Bittaker was Norris, who began his testimony on January 22. Norris testified as to how he became acquainted with Bittaker in jail, and how the pair had formulated a plan to kidnap, rape and kill teenage girls. Responding to questions from the prosecutor, Norris stated that in June 1979, he had unsuccessfully attempted to abduct and rape a woman, who escaped unharmed. When he informed Bittaker of this incident, they both agreed to act together on all future abductions. Norris then chronologically recounted for the court the details of each of the five murders he and Bittaker had committed in addition to the September 30, 1979 rape of Robeck; the attempted abduction of a woman named Jan Malin, which had also occurred on September 30; and the attempted abduction of an unidentified young woman on September 27. In reference to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire coat hanger. The pair had then thrown her body into a location at or near the San Dimas Canyon. In reference to the murder of Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Lamp and Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for \\"over a day\\" before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that \\"I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. I knew this was coming, so I agreed.\\" Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Schaefer and Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van. Several witnesses testified as to Bittaker having shown them pictures of the victims he had retained as keepsakes and which had been found in his motel. One witness, a 17-year-old neighbor of Bittaker's named Christina Dralle, testified that Bittaker had shown her a Polaroid picture he had taken of Gilliam before stating, \\"The girls I get won't talk anymore.\\" Another witness to testify was an individual named Lloyd Douglas, who had shared a jail cell with Bittaker following his November 1979 arrest. Douglas testified that Bittaker had discussed in detail the torture he had inflicted on victims Gilliam and Ledford, stating Bittaker had informed him he had stabbed one of Gilliam's breasts with an ice pick, which he then twisted as the tool remained inserted in the wound; he had also \\"pinched\\" Gilliam on the legs and breasts with a vise grip, before tearing off part of one nipple. Douglas also stated Bittaker had informed him he had \\"pulled on\\" the genitals and breasts of Shirley Ledford with the same instrument, and that he had attempted to beat her breasts \\"back into her chest.\\" The defense contended that Norris was the actual perpetrator of the murders and that Bittaker had only become aware of Norris's activities shortly before his arrest when Norris had informed him he had murdered several girls with whom they had both encountered and engaged in sexual activities. To support their case, the defense produced a friend of Norris named Richard Shoopman, who testified as to Norris's repeatedly divulging to him his desire to rape young girls. Shoopman also testified that Norris had informed him that the look of shock and fear on the face of a young girl was a prime sexual stimulus for him. In support of Bittaker's case, the defense also harked to the Polaroid images taken of the facial expressions of Hall, and of Bittaker's statements as to Norris's revelations to Bittaker regarding his prime sexual stimulations while both were incarcerated at the California Men's Colony in 1977. Shirley Lynette Ledford. The audio recording of her abuse at Bittaker's hands was the most damning evidence presented at his trial. The most damning evidence presented at Bittaker's trial was a 17-minute section of the audio tape the pair had created of Ledford's abuse and torment. The audiotape, which had been found inside Bittaker's van and which Norris had earlier testified Bittaker had repeatedly played as he drove in the weeks prior to his arrest‚Äîadding that Bittaker considered the contents to be \\"real funny\\"‚Äîwas presented in evidence on January 29, with Stephen Kay forewarning the jury: \\"For those of you who do not know what hell is like, you will find out.\\" (Judge Fredericks had earlier denied motions by the defense to omit the tape recording from admission as evidence.) More than 100 people were present in the courtroom as the tape was played, and many members of both the jury and the audience wept openly upon hearing the contents, with several members of the audience either burying their heads in their hands, dabbing tears from their eyes or rushing out of the courtroom before the tape had finished. Bittaker was undisturbed at hearing the contents of the tape‚Äîsmiling throughout the hearing of the recording.Couples who Kill p. 28 In one of two instances throughout the trial when prosecutor Stephen Kay was reduced to tears, he walked out of the courtroom during recess following the hearing of the recording of Ledford's rape, abuse, and torture. Weeping openly, Kay stated to the reporters gathered outside the courtroom: \\"Everybody who has heard that tape has had it affect their lives. I just picture those girls ... how alone they were when they died.\\" When questioned by reporters whether the audiotape should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: \\"You're darn right it [the audio tape] should have been. The jury needs to know what these guys did.\\" On February 5, 1981, Bittaker testified on his own behalf. Bittaker denied any knowledge in the abduction and murder of Schaefer, and claimed he had paid Hall to pose for the Polaroid photographs depicting her found at his Burbank motel after Hall had agreed to his offer of $200 for sex. He then claimed Norris had walked Hall into the San Gabriel Mountains, before returning alone and informing Bittaker he had told Hall to \\"find her own way home.\\" Bittaker had a similar explanation as to the double murder of Lamp and Gilliam: he claimed Gilliam accepted an offer of money for sex and posing for pictures, and that he had last seen the girls alone with Norris in his GMC van. With regards to the murder of Ledford, he claimed she had agreed to theatrically scream for the tape recorder, and that she was not tortured in his presence, but had been left alone with Norris. =Closing arguments= Bittaker's trial lasted for over three weeks. On February 9, 1981, the prosecution and defense counsels began their closing arguments. In the closing argument delivered by the prosecution, Kay apologized to the jury that he was only asking for the death penalty, adding that he wished the law permitted him to request that the same suffering be inflicted upon Bittaker that he had inflicted upon his victims. Kay then described Bittaker as an \\"excuse for a man\\" as he held aloft pictures of each of the five murdered girls before the jury. Seeking the death penalty for Bittaker, Kay referred to the case as \\"one of the most shocking, brutal cases in the history of American crime,\\" before adding: \\"If the death penalty is not appropriate in this case, then when will it ever be?\\" In his own closing argument before the jury, Deputy District Attorney C. Randolph Ramsey discredited Bittaker's claims that‚Äîcontrary to Norris's testimony‚ÄîShirley Lynette Ledford had agreed to scream, weep, and plead for mercy theatrically for the tape recording introduced as evidence, stating to the jury: \\"You've heard the sounds on this tape ... Ms. Ledford screaming, yelling 'Don't touch me! No, no, no, no, no!' That tape should be sufficient corroboration by itself!\\" Defense attorney Albert Garber requested the jury discount the testimony of Norris; arguing in favor of Bittaker's claims that Norris had committed the actual murders, and claiming the testimony of the prosecutors throughout the trial amounted to little more than a \\"bloodlust,\\" adding that the prosecution had repeatedly recited the \\"gory details\\" of the murders. Garber harked to the earlier testimony of a psychologist named Michael Maloney, who had testified as to Bittaker's inability to empathize with other people's feelings and emotions in addition to the fact that, with the exception of Bittaker's 1974 stabbing of Gary Louie, all of Bittaker's previous criminal convictions were for nonviolent offenses. The defense also claimed that insufficient corroborative evidence existed to convict Bittaker. On February 17, 1981, after deliberating for three days, the jury found Bittaker guilty of five counts of first-degree murder, one charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, five charges of kidnapping, nine charges of rape, two charges of forcible oral copulation, one charge of sodomy, and three charges of unlawful possession of a firearm. Deliberations as to whether Bittaker should be sentenced to death or life without parole began February 19. The jury deliberated for just 90 minutes before they returned with their verdict: Bittaker was sentenced to death for the five counts of first-degree murder upon which the prosecution had sought this penalty. He showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered. Superior Court Judge Thomas Fredericks then ordered Bittaker to appear in court on March 24 for formal sentencing. On March 24, in accordance with the jury verdict, Bittaker was formally sentenced to death. In the event that the sentence imposed was ever reverted to life imprisonment, Judge Thomas Fredericks imposed an alternative sentence of 199 years, 4 months' imprisonment to take immediate effect. =Imprisonment and appeals= Bittaker appealed his conviction and sentencing, citing procedural errors such as the validity of warrants used to authorize the search of his van and motel room, and the dismissal by the judge of a woman initially hired at the stage of jury selection to advise the defense counsel in matters relating to jury views upon the death penalty. Nonetheless, Bittaker's appeal was dismissed on June 22, 1989, with the court ruling that any procedural errors were minor and‚Äîin view of the strong evidence against Bittaker‚Äîdid not affect the overall verdict. An initial execution date for Bittaker was set for December 29, 1989. Bittaker appealed this decision, although on June 11, 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision that he be executed. A renewed execution date was scheduled for July 23, 1991. Bittaker again appealed the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that he be executed, and was granted a further stay of execution on July 9, 1991. Bittaker remained incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison until his death in December 2019. Aftermath Bittaker granted several death row interviews following his 1981 conviction. He never expressed any remorse for his crimes; repeatedly stating the only remorse he felt had been for the fact he and Norris were arrested, thus \\"ruining\\" his own life.Journey into Darkness p. 66 Despite the fact Bittaker considered his life to have been a \\"wasted\\" one, he also marveled that he and Norris had little in common before their acquaintance at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo in 1977, before adding that they had \\"one hell of a lot in common now!\\" In reference to one of the implements he and Norris had used to torture and murder their victims, Bittaker responded to letters he received with the nickname \\"Pliers\\" Bittaker. While incarcerated, Bittaker filed more than 40 frivolous lawsuits over issues as trivial as his being served a broken cookie and crushed sandwiches by the prison cafeteria, which he cited as an example of his being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Bittaker was declared a vexatious litigant in 1993. As a result of this declaration, he was not allowed to file lawsuits without the express permission of an attorney or a judge. Bittaker died while incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison on December 13, 2019, at the age of 79. His death was reported as being due to natural causes. Norris was incarcerated at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility. He died of natural causes at the California Medical Facility on February 24, 2020, at the age of 72, having been transferred to this facility one week prior to his death. Since his conviction, he had repeatedly claimed the sole reason he participated in the murders was out of fear of Bittaker. Norris also claimed to have twice contemplated confessing to his and Bittaker's responsibility in the murders to the police; he also claimed to have successfully deterred three potential victims from entering Bittaker's van. Although Norris readily admitted that he enjoyed the actual intercourse with the victims, he claimed only Bittaker enjoyed the acts of torture and murder, stating: \\"I didn't enjoy killing‚Äîthat was Lawrence [Bittaker]. It was his favorite part: watching the women struggle to live; knowing he'd soon be taking life away.\\" (Both investigators and psychologists have stated Norris derived extreme gratification from the domination, abuse, and torture inflicted upon his victims; these respective parties have also harked towards Norris's extensive history of physical and sexual violence against women prior to his meeting Bittaker, and his repeated instances of denial of culpability for his actions.) Norris initially became eligible for parole in 2009. Norris declined to attend the parole hearing, thereby automatically deferring his parole eligibility for another 10 years. He was denied parole again in 2019, and died while still incarcerated early the following year. Stephen Kay, the prosecutor at Bittaker's trial, still considers the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as being the worst criminal case he has ever prosecuted or encountered and remained insistent in his belief that, prior to Bittaker's death via natural causes, he had been more deserving of being executed than any other inmate incarcerated on California's death row. In interviews, he has stated that for over two years following the trial of Lawrence Bittaker, his sleep was disturbed by recurring nightmares in which he would be rushing to Bittaker's van to prevent harm coming to the girls, but would \\"always get there too late.\\" Paul Bynum, the chief investigator of the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris, committed suicide in December 1987. He was 39 years old. In a ten-page suicide note, Bynum specifically referred to the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as haunting him, and of his fear they may be released from prison. The audio cassette Bittaker and Norris created of themselves raping and torturing Ledford remains in the possession of the FBI Academy. This recording is now used to train and desensitize FBI agents to the raw reality of torture and murder.

Overview The launchpad for the world's first human spaceflight made by Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1 in 1961, the site was referred to as Site No.1 (, Ploshchadka No. 1) as the first one of its kind. It is also sometimes referred to as NIIP-5 LC1, Baikonur LC1, LC-1/5, LC-1 or GIK-5 LC1. On 17 March 1954, the Council of Ministers ordered several ministries to select a site for a proving ground to test the R-7 rocket by 1 January 1955. A special reconnaissance commission considered several possible geographic regions and selected Tyuratam in the Kazakh SSR. This selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers, with a completion of construction targeted for 1958.Origin of the test range in Tyuratam at Russianspaceweb.com Work on the construction of Site No.1 began on 20 July 1955 by military engineers. Day and night more than 60 powerful trucks worked at the site; of earth were excavated and removed per day, with the total volume estimated to be . During winter explosives were widely utilised. By the end of October 1956, all primary buildings and installation of infrastructure for R-7 tests were completed. The Installation and Testing Building (, Montazhno- ispytatel'nyj korpus) named \\"Site No.2\\" was built and a special railway completed from there to Site No.1 where the launch pad for the rocket was located. Creation and Launch of the First Earth's Satellite by V.Poroshkov By April 1957, all remaining work was completed and the site was ready for launches. The R-7 missile made its maiden voyage from LC-1 on 15 May 1957. On 4 October 1957, the pad was used to launch the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. Manned spaceflights launched from the site include Yuri Gagarin's flight, Valentina Tereshkova's flight, and numerous other human spaceflight missions, including all Soviet and Russian manned spaceflights to Mir. The pad was also used to launch Luna program spacecraft, Mars probe program spacecraft, Venera program spacecraft, many Cosmos satellites and others.Baikonur LC1 From 1957 through 1966 the site hosted ready-to-launch strategic nuclear ICBMs in addition to spacecraft launches; by the 2000s there were more than 400 launches from the site.Gagarin's pad The 500th launch from this site was of Soyuz TMA-18M on 2 September 2015. In 1961, the growing launch schedule of the Soviet space program resulted in the opening of a sister pad at Baikonur, LC-31/6. LC-1 has been the primary facility for manned launches, with occasional Soyuz flights from LC-31/6. LC-1 was damaged several times by booster explosions during the early years. As of 2016, the most recent accident to occur on or around the pad was the attempted launch of Soyuz T-10-1 in September 1983 ended disastrously when the booster caught fire during prelaunch preparations and exploded, causing severe damage that left LC-1 inoperable for almost a year. In 2019, Gagarin's Start hosted its last two crewed launches in July and September before its planned modernisation for Soyuz-2 rockets with a planned first launch at 2023.https://ria.ru/20190808/1557281344.html In place of Gagarin's Start, crewed missions will use the new Soyuz-2 rocket which is launched from Site 31. The first crewed mission from Site 31 since 2012 was Soyuz MS-16 on 9 April 2020. The last flight from Gagarin's Start was the Soyuz MS-15 flight to ISS, launched 25 September 2019.

Overwhelmed by a mob of one thousand at the Douglas County Courthouse, the twelve city police officers stood by without intervening. Afterward, the mayor called the lynching \\"the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\\"Ginzburg, R. (1988) 100 Years of Lynchings. Black Classic Press. p 129. Biography and death Coe was a married man with two children who lived on North 12th Street north of downtown Omaha. On October 7, 1891, Lizzie Yates, a five-year-old white child who also lived in North Omaha, accused Coe of assaulting her. Before the verdict was passed rumors swept through Omaha about Coe getting away with the crime, about the girl dying, and about Coe receiving a small punishment. A crowd of men was already gathered at the old Douglas County Courthouse the day when Coe was brought in, to witness an unrelated, scheduled hanging, an official execution. Rumors flew around Omaha that the girl had died, the guilty party was in jail, and was only going to be punished with 20 years' incarceration.Peattie, E.W. (2005) Impertinences: Selected Writings of Elia Peattie, a Journalist in the Gilded Age. University of Nebraska Press. p. 106. The next day, a mob of several hundred to 1,000 men formed in downtown Omaha early on October 10 and overwhelmed the police at the courthouse.Quintard Taylor, In Search Of The Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990, New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1998, p.205 Councilman Moriarty drove his cane through a window and led the men against the courthouse.Ginzburg, R. (1988), p 128, Reprint of 5 Oct 1919 article, Omaha Bee. Leaders drove Coe to the assumed victim's house in the Near North Side neighborhood to be identified by the parents. The mother immediately said she had seen Coe roaming around the house, although she would not swear that it was him. When the mob brought Coe back to the courthouse to be lynched, James E. Boyd, the governor of Nebraska, and the county sheriff both appealed to the men to disperse. Instead, by midnight a crowd of 1,000 to 10,000 people had gathered at the courthouse.Ginzburg, R. (1988), Reprint of 5 Oct 1919 article, Omaha Bee, p 129. Note: This account was written by the inflammatory Omaha Bee shortly after the Sept. 1919 race riot, to which the Bee likely contributed by yellow journalism before the event. Their estimate of the size of the crowd is ten times larger an academic historian's account and may be overstated. The mob beat Coe and dragged him through city streets. He was probably already dead when he was hung from a streetcar wire at 17th and Harney Streets.Taylor, Q. (1998) In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990. W. W. Norton & Company. p. 206. Omaha mayor Richard C. Cushing quickly condemned the lynching as \\"the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\\"Ginzburg, R. (1988) p 129. Aftermath Seven men were arrested for the crime, including the chief of police and the manager of a large dry goods store. A mob gathered outside the jail and threatened to destroy it unless the suspects were freed on bail but the County Attorney was determined to refuse them.\\"Lynchers under arrest\\", The New York Times. October 11, 1891. Retrieved 5/25/08. The following day when Coe's body was set for public viewing at a downtown mortuary, six thousand spectators filed by. Hucksters sold pieces of the lynching rope as souvenirs.Bristow, D.L. (2002) A Dirty, Wicked Town. Caxton Press. p 253. Ten days after the lynching, the Douglas County Assistant Coroner testified in court that Smith died of \\"fright\\", rather than of the wounds inflicted on him by the mob. Those wounds included sixteen wounds to his body and three vertebrae broken in his spine. Despite this, the coroner testified, \\"[T]he heart was so contracted and the blood was in such a condition that the doctor was satisfied that the man was literally scared to death.\\" County Attorney Mahoney said he would have to modify the charges against the lynchers.\\"Smith died of fright\\", The New York Times, October 20, 1891.

It is the fifth episode of the show‚Äôs fourth season and aired on October 28, 2007, in the United States. Plot The new neighbors of Wisteria Lane, Bob and Lee, install a sculpture in their front yard and the rest of the neighbors declare it an eyesore except for Susan, who is still trying to get on their good side.Season 4, ‚ÄúArt Isn‚Äôt Easy‚Äù approximately 1:10 But even she has to object when its true function is revealed early the next morning: It is a water fountain, and a noisy one at that.Season 4, ‚ÄúArt Isn‚Äôt Easy‚Äù approximately 4:13 She asks them to move it to the backyard and they refuse, claiming they need it to cover all the noise coming from her house.Season 4, ‚ÄúArt Isn‚Äôt Easy‚Äù approximately 5:30 Katherine Mayfair decides to run for president of the homeowner‚Äôs association, which has languished since the death of its former president, Mary Alice Young. Bob and Lee try to get Lynette Scavo on their side and she only agrees after they convince her that Katherine will object to her kids‚Äô treehouse. When Katherine will not promise her that the treehouse will be spared, Lynette decides to run against her. Lynette expects Susan to vote for her, but she remains firmly anti-fountain. The vote comes down to a tie (as Susan voted for both Katherine and Lynette), but Edie Britt points out that Susan voted twice. Susan reluctantly puts in her vote for Katherine. A triumphant Katherine informs Bob and Lee, and Lynette, that she will be in touch regarding their infractions. Her husband Adam though refuses to congratulate Katherine on her victory, reminding her that she has not exactly made any friends since they moved to Wisteria Lane, and that if she remembers what ‚Äúincident‚Äù happened in Chicago, friends can be very handy. Bree Hodge is furious when she finds out that her husband‚Äôs mother Phyllis Van De Kamp has taken Danielle out of the convent. Danielle refuses to go back ‚Äì she wants to deliver the baby at her grandmother‚Äôs retirement village. Bree is certain Phyllis has had a hand in helping Danielle with her decision to raise the baby herself. Bree admits defeat, convinced it is just Danielle‚Äôs maternal instinct finally kicking in, until her son Andrew points out that his grandmother is giving Danielle a cushier life than Bree‚Äôs plan of making her attend community college. He tells Bree she is going to have to outbid Phyllis if she wants the baby. Bree and her husband Orson tell Danielle how proud they are that she is raising the baby on her own, instead of going to that ‚Äúparty school‚Äù in Florida, the one they no longer have any objections to her attending. Once they mention the convertible they were going to give her, and how Phyllis is not in the best health, Danielle agrees to let Bree raise the baby after all. Bree promises a heartbroken Phyllis that she will ask her to babysit. Carlos Solis tells his fianc√©e Edie, he is going off on a golfing weekend with the guys when he is really sneaking away to meet his ex-wife Gabrielle. Gabrielle is just about to leave her home when she notices that a cable van has been parked across the street for an unusually long time. Guessing that her husband Victor Lang has hired someone to tail her, she sneaks out of her house in disguise. She arrives at the hotel for her rendezvous with Carlos and runs into her former gardener John Rowland, with whom she had a secret affair during her marriage with Carlos, and his hotel heiress wife, who is pregnant and puts John down at every turn. Carlos is less than pleased when John comes knocking on Gabrielle‚Äôs hotel room door that night, but she convinces him to hide, since John‚Äôs father-in-law is a friend of Victor‚Äôs. John tells her he wants to restart their affair. With Carlos listening to every word, John reminds her of the time she faked an orgasm with Carlos when John was hiding in the closet. She firmly tells John she is not interested and sees him out the door. Carlos is furious but Gabrielle points out that he is the man hiding in the closet now. Carlos tells Gabrielle it is time they ended the affair. He wants them to do this right by breaking up with their respective partners before getting back together. She agrees, and gives him a kiss to last for the next six months. Unfortunately, that is the kiss that is photographed by the man tailing her. Susan promises Lynette that she will chain herself to the treehouse rather than let Katherine knock it down and Lynette confesses why it means so much: It is the one place her boys can be children and not have to hear about her cancer. Just then Katherine comes over and tells her the treehouse can stay. Lynette is puzzled, but happy. When Katherine tells Bob and Lee the fountain has got to go, they counter by telling they know ‚Äúall about Chicago‚Äù, hinting at the scandal that forced her and Adam to leave town. Edie is shown admitting to someone offscreen that she had always avoided falling in love, and now that she has, she has been hurt. The screen pulls back to show the agent, revealing the man was not working for Victor, but for Edie.

It originally aired on September 24, 2007. Plot Future Ted tells his children that, although they know the short story of how he met their mother, there is a bigger story of how he became the man he needed to be in order to meet her. At Lily and Marshall's wedding, Barney tries to get Ted out to help him \\"conquer New York\\" but Ted says he is not ready yet. Robin returns from Argentina with her new boyfriend Gael and Ted announces he's finally ready, having decided that Robin is trying to win their breakup. Marshall backs up this theory by explaining to Lily about the winner and loser in each break-up, so Barney takes Ted out to help him win by getting Ted \\"a 12\\" (given that he says Robin is \\"a 10\\") but Ted gets \\"a 12\\" on his own, a tattooed girl called Amy (guest star Mandy Moore). Meanwhile, Lily and Marshall are having a night in with Robin and Gael after Lily inadvertently asks Gael out on a double date. They are supposed to be supporting Ted by hating Gael, but both end up falling for Gael as he plays the acoustic guitar, gives massages and sensually feeds fruit to everyone else. On the night out with Ted, Barney clashes with Amy about everything and insists that he should be helping Ted as he is his wing-man but Ted is solely interested in Amy. Ted decides to get a tattoo, but blacks out shortly after. The following morning, Lily and Marshall spot a butterfly tattoo on Ted's lower back and call Barney to come and see it. Lily and Marshall explain what happened in the apartment the night before, which annoys Ted who goes to see Robin and accuses her of being over their break-up too fast. She says she cried for three days at the start of her holiday about missing Ted, which led her to Gael. Ted is still upset that Gael is so attractive, but Robin tells Ted that he has a bigger penis than Gael, which leads Ted to tell the guys at the bar that he has won the break-up. In the epilogue, Barney is terrified upon seeing a countdown clock at roughly 55 days until Marshall is to give him the third slap in their Slap Bet. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode B+. Staci Krause of IGN gave the episode 8.7 out of 10.

Lynette makes clear that she associates the possum with her cancer as something that disturbs the harmony of her beloved family and she continues her hunt. The next day she learns that she is free from cancer. Breathing a sigh of relief, Lynette walks into her yard to enjoy the calm night being free from fearing for her life. Suddenly she sees the possum lying dead by the fence and tearfully apologizes to it. Gay couple Bob Hunter and Lee McDermott are hosting a Halloween party and decide to invite Bree first, since she has a gay son and is more likely to accept them. They catch a glimpse of Bree's pregnant daughter Danielle Van De Kamp, who everybody thinks is in Switzerland and not pregnant, looking out a bedroom window. Bree lies quickly saying that it is just her son Andrew, trying out his costume as Cher. She forbids Danielle from attending the party which leads to an argument between them. Bree tells Danielle she will know Danielle is finally grown up when the day she sees a glimmer of herself in Danielle. Danielle suddenly arrives to the party as a clone of Bree and exaggerating Bree's mannerisms. Even though everyone is entertained by Danielle, Bree is clearly upset and pulls Danielle aside. She explains she is only following her mother's wish to be more like her. Bree tells Danielle to go home, but it is too late as Danielle's water just broke onto the carpet. Andrew, Bree, Orson, and Danielle rush to their house and start to panic, as the baby is coming fast. Orson volunteers to deliver the baby since he's a doctor, but Bree says he's too drunk and he's a dentist. She drags Adam, a gynecologist, to the house and makes him promise to keep what he's about to do a secret. Adam claims to being able to tell Bree was faking pregnancy already. Meanwhile, Parker, Preston, Porter and Kayla are trick-or-treating and ring the doorbell. When no one answers, the Scavo children tell of their tradition of tricking when they don't get treated. As they plan to pull their prank, they accidentally witness the baby being born through a window; they scream and run away. After the infant is delivered, Bree brings him to Danielle, who admits that Bree was right about maternal love, and that giving him to Bree would be best for him. Danielle names the boy Benjamin before giving him up. Meanwhile, Carlos's ex-wife and secret lover Gabrielle Lang leaves her husband Victor by voicemail. She comes home to find Victor's father, Milton, waiting for her and telling her a divorce on the eve of Victor's running for governor would be damaging. He offers her a substantial check dated for next year, in condition she will have to stay married to Victor for the next 13 months. Gabrielle shows Carlos the check, suggesting they extend their original six-month separation to 13 months. She tells him they need it since he is not working right now, so he tells her about the 10 million dollars. She realizes that he had the money when they were married and during the divorce. She says if she cannot trust him she cannot be with him. Gabrielle plans to go off by herself to think things over but finds Victor waiting for her. He vows to make time for her and starts ripping pages out of his planner proving that he will not run for governor as being governor was his father's dream for him, not his. Edie Britt catches her fianc√© Carlos Solis moving out and tells him she just wants him to tell her if there is someone else he wants to be with or rather why he is leaving her. He lies telling her there is nobody else and she smiles thanking him for making this ‚Äúall easier‚Äù on her. She marches straight to the Internal Revenue Service to tell on him for having an illegal bank account worth 10 million dollars. Edie's revenge scheme falls apart when the Internal Revenue Service agent tells her that the offshore account numbers she gave him do not exist. She confronts Carlos over moving the money and he denies ever having the stash in the first place. Edie warns him that he is going to pay for what he has done to her. Later, Edie meets with Victor and shows him the photos of Gabrielle and Carlos kissing that her private investigator took.

SOD1 is one of three human superoxide dismutases. It is implicated in apoptosis and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Structure  SOD1 is a 32 kDa homodimer which forms a Œ≤-barrel and contains an intramolecular disulfide bond and a binuclear Cu/Zn site in each subunit. This Cu/Zn site holds the copper and a zinc ion and is responsible for catalyzing the disproportionation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen. The maturation process of this protein is complex and not fully understood, involving the selective binding of copper and zinc ions, formation of the intra-subunit disulfide bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146, and dimerization of the two subunits. The copper chaperone for Sod1 (CCS) facilitates copper insertion and disulfide oxidation. Though SOD1 is synthesized in the cytosol and can mature there, the fraction of expressed, and still immature, SOD1 targeted to the mitochondria must be inserted into the intermembrane space. There, it forms the disulfide bond, though not metalation, required for its maturation. The mature protein is highly stable, but unstable when in its metal-free and disulfide-reduced forms. This manifests in vitro, as the loss of metal ions results in increased SOD1 aggregation, and in disease models, where low metalation is observed for insoluble SOD1. Moreover, the surface- exposed reduced cysteines could participate in disulfide crosslinking and, thus, aggregation.  Function  SOD1 binds copper and zinc ions and is one of three superoxide dismutases responsible for destroying free superoxide radicals in the body. The encoded isozyme is a soluble cytoplasmic and mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, acting as a homodimer to convert naturally occurring, but harmful, superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can then be broken down by another enzyme called catalase. SOD1 has been postulated to localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), where superoxide anions would be generated, or the intermembrane space. The exact mechanisms for its localization remains unknown, but its aggregation to the OMM has been attributed to its association with BCL-2. Wildtype SOD1 has demonstrated antiapoptotic properties in neural cultures, while mutant SOD1 has been observed to promote apoptosis in spinal cord mitochondria, but not in liver mitochondria, though it is equally expressed in both. Two models suggest SOD1 inhibits apoptosis by interacting with BCL-2 proteins or the mitochondria itself.  Clinical significance  = Role in oxidative stress = Most notably, SOD1 is pivotal in reactive oxygen species (ROS) release during oxidative stress by ischemia-reperfusion injury, specifically in the myocardium as part of a heart attack (also known as ischemic heart disease). Ischemic heart disease, which results from an occlusion of one of the major coronary arteries, is currently still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in western society. During ischemia reperfusion, ROS release substantially contribute to the cell damage and death via a direct effect on the cell as well as via apoptotic signals. SOD1 is known to have a capacity to limit the detrimental effects of ROS. As such, SOD1 is important for its cardioprotective effects. In addition, SOD1 has been implicated in cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, such as during ischemic preconditioning of the heart. Although a large burst of ROS is known to lead to cell damage, a moderate release of ROS from the mitochondria, which occurs during nonlethal short episodes of ischemia, can play a significant triggering role in the signal transduction pathways of ischemic preconditioning leading to reduction of cell damage. It has even observed that during this release of ROS, SOD1 plays an important role hereby regulating apoptotic signaling and cell death. In one study, deletions in the gene were reported in two familial cases of keratoconus. Mice lacking SOD1 have increased age-related muscle mass loss (sarcopenia), early development of cataracts, macular degeneration, thymic involution, hepatocellular carcinoma, and shortened lifespan. Research suggests that increased SOD1 levels could be a biomarker for chronic heavy metal toxicity in women with long-term dental amalgam fillings. = Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) = Mutations (over 150 identified to date) in this gene have been linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, several pieces of evidence also show that wild-type SOD1, under conditions of cellular stress, is implicated in a significant fraction of sporadic ALS cases, which represent 90% of ALS patients. The most frequent mutation are A4V (in the U.S.A.) and H46R (Japan). In Iceland only SOD1-G93S has been found. The most studied ALS mouse model is G93A. Rare transcript variants have been reported for this gene. Virtually all known ALS-causing SOD1 mutations act in a dominant fashion; a single mutant copy of the SOD1 gene is sufficient to cause the disease. The exact molecular mechanism (or mechanisms) by which SOD1 mutations cause disease are unknown. It appears to be some sort of toxic gain of function, as many disease-associated SOD1 mutants (including G93A and A4V) retain enzymatic activity and Sod1 knockout mice do not develop ALS (although they do exhibit a strong age-dependent distal motor neuropathy). ALS is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of motor neurons causing muscle atrophy. The DNA oxidation product 8-OHdG is a well-established marker of oxidative DNA damage. 8-OHdG accumulates in the mitochondria of spinal motor neurons of persons with ALS. In transgenic ALS mice harboring a mutant SOD1 gene, 8-OHdG also accumulates in mitochondrial DNA of spinal motor neurons. These findings suggest that oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA of motor neurons due to altered SOD1 may be significant factor in the etiology of ALS.  A4V mutation  A4V (alanine at codon 4 changed to valine) is the most common ALS-causing mutation in the U.S. population, with approximately 50% of SOD1-ALS patients carrying the A4V mutation. Approximately 10 percent of all U.S. familial ALS cases are caused by heterozygous A4V mutations in SOD1. The mutation is rarely if ever found outside the Americas. It was recently estimated that the A4V mutation occurred 540 generations (~12,000 years) ago. The haplotype surrounding the mutation suggests that the A4V mutation arose in the Asian ancestors of Native Americans, who reached the Americas through the Bering Strait. The A4V mutant belongs to the WT-like mutants. Patients with A4V mutations exhibit variable age of onset, but uniformly very rapid disease course, with average survival after onset of 1.4 years (versus 3‚Äì5 years with other dominant SOD1 mutations, and in some cases such as H46R, considerably longer). This survival is considerably shorter than non-mutant SOD1 linked ALS.  H46R mutation  H46R (histidine at codon 47 changed to arginine) is the most common ALS-causing mutation in the Japanese population, with about 40% of Japanese SOD1-ALS patients carrying this mutation. H46R causes a profound loss of copper binding in the active site of SOD1, and as such, H46R is enzymatically inactive. The disease course of this mutation is extremely long, with the typical time from onset to death being over 15 years. Mouse models with this mutation do not exhibit the classical mitochondrial vacuolation pathology seen in G93A and G37R ALS mice and unlike G93A mice, deficiency of the major mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, SOD2, has no effect on their disease course.  G93A mutation  G93A (glycine 93 changed to alanine) is a comparatively rare mutation, but has been studied very intensely as it was the first mutation to be modeled in mice. G93A is a pseudo-WT mutation that leaves the enzyme activity intact. Because of the ready availability of the G93A mouse from Jackson Laboratory, many studies of potential drug targets and toxicity mechanisms have been carried out in this model. At least one private research institute (ALS Therapy Development Institute) is conducting large-scale drug screens exclusively in this mouse model. Whether findings are specific for G93A or applicable to all ALS causing SOD1 mutations is at present unknown. It has been argued that certain pathological features of the G93A mouse are due to overexpression artefacts, specifically those relating to mitochondrial vacuolation (the G93A mouse commonly used from Jackson Lab has over 20 copies of the human SOD1 gene). At least one study has found that certain features of pathology are idiosyncratic to G93A and not extrapolatable to all ALS-causing mutations. Further studies have shown that the pathogenesis of the G93A and H46R models are clearly distinct; some drugs and genetic interventions that are highly beneficial/detrimental in one model have either the opposite or no effect in the other. =Down syndrome= Down syndrome (DS) is caused by a triplication of chromosome 21. Oxidative stress is thought be an important underlying factor in DS-related pathologies. The oxidative stress appears to be due to the triplication and increased expression of the SOD1 gene located in chromosome 21. Increased expression of SOD1 likely causes increased production of hydrogen peroxide leading to increased cellular injury. The levels of 8-OHdG in the DNA of persons with DS, measured in saliva, were found to be significantly higher than in control groups. 8-OHdG levels were also increased in the leukocytes of persons with DS compared to controls. These findings suggest that oxidative DNA damage may lead to some of the clinical features of DS.  Interactions  SOD1 has been shown to interact with CCS and Bcl-2.

New Delhi Heroes are the past Winners of the Inaugural DCM Cup ‚Äì 1945. They beat the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry 3‚Äì2. They are also seven-time DSA League winners ‚Äì 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959, 2007. They won the DSA League last season. They won the title in style by going through the entire campaign unbeaten. History =1939‚Äì2012= New Delhi Heroes, Delhi's most successful club was formed in 1939, just before the start of the Second World War. The founders of the club opted for green and yellow colours, which soon became a force to reckon with in the football fields of Delhi. In a time span of just fifteen years they became one of the most formidable teams of North India, winning several prestigious tournaments and producing several talented players, who have become legends in local football. Their greatest hour came in 1945, when they won the inaugural DCM Football tournament at the Talkatora grounds in Delhi. In the final they overcame a formidable British regimental team, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) 3‚Äì2 in a hard fought match. KOYLI had two players in their team who were war time internationals for England. In the 1950s an exciting new crop of players emerged to play for ND Heroes and they became the supreme team in the capital. They won the Delhi Football Association league four years in a row from 1953 to 1956. Later they were champions again in 1958 and 1959. After their success in 1954 ND Heroes was sent to Kabul in 1954 to take in the Afghan Independence celebrations on behalf of the government of India and also played in the Jinnah tournament in Karachi. During this decade they took part in all the major national tournaments like the IFA Shield in Calcutta Rovers Cup in Bombay and DCM and Durand tournaments in Delhi. Following the success of 119th Osian's Durand Cup in October‚ÄìNovember, 2006, IOS Sports and Entertainment, India's leading sports & entertainment management company, took over the club in May 2007, and the club became a wholly owned subsidiary of IOS. Immediately after the acquisition, the team acquired the services of Mr. Chima Okorie, who is very well known in the football fraternity for his contribution in Indian football. ND Heroes became Delhi's first professional club, and won the 2007 Delhi League title and represented the state in the I-League 2nd Division. =Present Status= The club will compete in the Delhi Senior Division in the 2012 season. The club is working towards satisfying the criteria for participation in the i-League second division in 2013, with an eventual goal of competing in the first division of i-League. The squad and coaching staff are undergoing a major overhaul for the upcoming season.

Virginia has undergone much electoral change since its settling in 1607, many of which were required by federal legislation. However, it remains a relatively conservative state in this respect compared to California and others which have experimented with various alternative systems. Direct election of U.S. Senators Originally, U.S. Senators were chosen by the Virginia General Assembly. On February 19, 1914, legislation was introduced in the Virginia House of Delegates calling for the direct election of United States senators by the voters of Virginia.Legislative Moments in Virginia History , Virginia Historical Society. This followed enactment of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on April 8, 1913. Virginia had not voted to ratify the amendment. Ballot access There have been many changes designed to make the electoral system more favorable to third parties. These included allowing write-in ballots in U.S. presidential elections. In 1998, SB 316 was passed, changing the number of signatures required for ballot access as follows:SB 316 Petition requirements in presidential elections. *In statewide races, reducing the number of signatures required from 0.5% of the number of registered voters (approximately 17,000 in 1998) to a flat 10,000; *In congressional district races, reducing the number of signatures required from 0.5% of the number of voters registered in the district (approximately 1,550 signatures based on the January 1, 1998, registered voter total) to 1,000; and *Increasing the number of signatures required from each congressional district from 200 to 400. Currently, the ballot access requirements are as follows:¬ß 24.2-506. Petition of qualified voters required; number of signatures required; certain towns excepted., Code of Virginia. *For a candidate for the United States Senate, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or Attorney General, 10,000 signatures, including the signatures of at least 400 qualified voters from each congressional district in the Commonwealth; *For a candidate for the United States House of Representatives, 1,000 signatures; *For a candidate for the Senate of Virginia, 250 signatures; *For a candidate for the House of Delegates or for a constitutional office, 125 signatures; *For a candidate for membership on the governing body or elected school board of any county or city, 125 signatures; or if from an election district not at large containing 1,000 or fewer registered voters, 50 signatures; *For a candidate for membership on the governing body or elected school board of any town which has more than 1,500 registered voters, 125 signatures; or if from a ward or other district not at large, 25 signatures; *For membership on the governing body or elected school board of any town which has 1,500 or fewer registered voters, no petition shall be required; *For a candidate for director of a soil and water conservation district created pursuant to Article 3 (¬ß 10.1-506 et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 10.1, 25 signatures; and *For any other candidate, 50 signatures. Voting system changes In 2003, FairVote's analysis of Virginia's voting systems determined that amendments to the Constitution of Virginia might be required to implement instant runoff voting in statewide executive elections.Fair Elections and the Law for the Commonwealth of Virginia , Elizabeth Reed, FairVote, 2003. ¬ß 24.2-673 of the Code of Virginia appears to require use of the plurality system in local executive office elections¬ß 24.2-673.

It has been described by a Western journalist as \\"a modern monument to the power of raw commerce\\".\\"'Made in China' moves into Russia's backyard\\". By Daniel Sershen. \\"The Christian Science Monitor\\", 2007-Jan-04 Dordoy Bazaar is a major shopping and employment centre for the Bishkek metropolitan area and entire Chuy River Valley region. It is also one of the main entrepots through which consumer goods from China arrive at shops and markets in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan.Uzbek- favoured Bishkek market catches fire (uznews.com, 2008-04-09) According to some economists, this re-export (the other center for which, targeting Uzbekistan, is the Karasuu Bazar at Kara-Suu, Osh Province) is one of two largest economic activities of Kyrgyzstan.Sebastien Peyrouse, Economic Aspects of China-Central Asia Rapprochment . Central Asia - Caucasus Institute, Silk Road Studies Program. 2007. p.18.  Location and organization  Announcement boards help merchants and shoppers find their way, and inform them of their legal rights The Dordoy market stretches for more than a kilometre on the north-eastern outskirts of Bishkek, near the bypass highway that skirts the city in the north. Legally, it is an agglomeration of several independent markets adjacent to each other. Since there are no fences, the borders between the markets are not particularly noticeable. According to a 2007 city atlas,\\"–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å –ë–∏—à–∫–µ–∫ –°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π, 2007-2008\\" (\\"Modern Bishkek\\" Atlas, 2007-2008), OsOO \\"SMIK\\", 2007. No ISBN. the component markets are: * Ak-Suu * Vostok ('East') * Sever ('North') * Muras-Sport * Alkanov i K ('Alkanov & Co.') * Evropa ('Europe') * Kerben * Kitay ('China') * Zhonghai (which formally is considered a separate market from Dordoy) Most of the market is built of double-stacked shipping containers. Typically, the lower container is a shop, while the upper one provides storage. According to a 2005 newspaper report, there were 6,000 to 7,000 containers in the bazaar. Approximately 20,000 people worked there (as vendors, security, or service personnel).Regine A. Spector, \\"Who Owns the Marketplace? Conflict over Property in Contemporary Kyrgyzstan\\". Prepared for the Graduate Student Conference, Department of Political Science, May 2, 2007. Berkeley, California, USA. (Draft version ) The containers, organized in dozens of rows, form streets and plazas of a sort. Smaller buildings between the blocks of containers house restaurants, administrative offices, toilets, hotels, and other ancillary structures.  History  A busy day in the apparel section The market is said to date from 1992, its 15th anniversary being celebrated in 2007. In the view of journalists from the neighbouring Uzbekistan, one of the causes for the rise of Bishkek's Dordoy Bazaar was the decline of Uzbekistan's major wholesale markets. After the Uzbek government transferred Tashkent's huge Hippodrome Market to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior in 1998, increased police harassment of the trader resulted in Hippodrome losing its dominant position in the region. After its reconstruction in 2002-2003, Hippodrome, which once had 8,600 trading outlets and 18,000 traders, was succeeded by the much smaller Chilanzar goods market with 2,540 outlets. A similar story took place in Jizzakh, where in 2006 authorities closed the Dunyo Bozori (Uzbek for \\"World Market\\") marketplace (which had been established by Chinese traders) to replace it with the Abu Sahiy Nur shopping centre. As Uzbekistan's markets declined, purchasing by Uzbek buyers has shifted to Kyrgyzstan's Bishkek or Kara-Suu.  Ownership and management  Most of the marketplace (Dordoy proper, i.e. everything but Zhonghai) is run by OsOO \\"Dordoy Bazari\\" (), a member of the \\"group of companies\\" called Dordoi Association.Dordoi Bazary The Zhonghai section is run by Dordoi Asia, another member of the same group.Dordoi Asia Besides the Dordoy markets, Dordoi Association also owns the smaller Alamedi Market, closer to central Bishkek (via OsOO \\"Alamudun Bazari\\" ()), Dordoi Plaza shopping mall in downtown Bishkek, a number of manufacturing and service companies in Bishkek and elsewhere, a beach resort at Koshkol' on Lake Issyk Kul,–ü–∞–Ω—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞—Ç ¬´–î–æ—Ä–¥–æ–π Marine-club¬ª (Dordoi Marine Club Resort) and the soccer team Dordoi-Dynamo Naryn.Dordoi Dynamo  The traders  Naan vendors feed the hungry shopkeepers and market-goers Different sections of the markets specialize in various types of consumer goods, including clothing, shoes, furniture, electric and electronic equipment, toys, automotive supplies, construction materials, etc. While some kinds of groceries (e.g. factory-packaged canned goods or sweets) are sold at Dordoy, it is not a produce market. Occasional produce vendors are present merely to feed the vendors and customers. Most of the goods sold at Dordoy arrive from China, with the second largest source (perhaps 30% of all imports) being Turkey.TURKEY‚ÄôS CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC PRESENCE GROWS IN KYRGYZSTAN.

By: Erica Marat] One can also find clothing from Thailand and Europe, music CDs from Russia, and goods from many other countries in Eurasia, as well as a selection of local products. Although many of the people working and shopping at the Bazaar speak Kyrgyz, Russian is the main language used in trade.  Transportation  A typical clothing aisle, with only a few containers open at the moment There is no rail access to the market: all goods enter and depart the bazaar by truck or car. Two large plazas near the northern and southern ends of the market are connected by frequent minibus service with central Bishkek. From the northern plaza, minibuses also run to various points throughout Chuy Province, including Sokuluk, Kant, Tokmok, and Korday border crossing (on the Kazakhstan border). For the convenience of the \\"shuttle traders\\", charter buses run from Dordoy to several major cities in Kazakhstan and in Russia's Urals and Western Siberia.

Because KITE was a daytimer at the time, KITE-FM was able to continue its programming into the night. KITE-AM-FM were owned by Charles W. Balthrope. KITE-FM was powered at 6,200 watts, a fraction of its current output. A few years later, the station flipped to a beautiful music format. The call sign switched to KEEZ in 1958, to reflect easy listening music. In 1960, KEEZ and KITE were bought by the Townsend U.S. International Growth Fund.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page 239 The power increased to 17,500 watts, covering San Antonio and its suburbs in that era. KEEZ was sold to San Antonio Broadcasting Company in 1975. SABC was owned by Lowry Mays, BJ Red McCombs, and a Paul Schaffer (not the one from The Late Show). A year later the same owners bought AM 1200 WOAI, and owing to WOAI operating as a 50,000 watt clear-channel station, named their company Clear Channel Communications. In the late seventies SBC and Clear Channel were merged into a new Clear Channel, which went on to own more than 1,000 radio stations. KEEZ became WOAI-FM from 1978-1981. The station adopted the KAJA call letters and current country format in 1981. In 1987, KAJA got a rival FM station, when 100.3 KCYY began its own country music format.

Presenilin-1 is one of the four core proteins in the gamma secretase complex, which is considered to play an important role in generation of amyloid beta (AŒ≤) from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Accumulation of amyloid beta is associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease.  Structure  Presenilin possesses a 9 transmembrane domain topology, with an extracellular C-terminus and a cytosolic N-terminus. Presenilin undergoes endo-proteolytic processing to produce ~27-28 kDa N-terminal and ~16-17 kDa C-terminal fragments in humans. Furthermore, presenilin exists in the cell mainly as a heterodimer of the C-terminal and N-terminus fragments. When presenilin 1 is overexpressed, the full length protein accumulates in an inactive form. Based on evidence that a gamma-secretase inhibitor binds to the fragments, the cleaved presenilin complex is considered to be the active form.  Function  Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing through their effects on gamma secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also, it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch receptor, such that they either directly regulate gamma secretase activity or themselves are protease enzymes. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene, the full-length natures of only some have been determined. = Notch signaling pathway = In Notch signaling, critical proteolytic reactions takes place during maturation and activation of Notch membrane receptor. Notch1 is cleaved extracellularlly at site1 (S1) and two polypeptides are produced to form a heterodimer receptor on the cell surface. After the formation of receptor, Notch1 is further cleaved in site 3(S3) and release Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane. Presenilin 1 has been shown to play an important role in proteolytic process. In the prenilin 1 null mutant drosophila, Notch signaling is abolished and it displays a notch-like lethal phenotype. Moreover, in mammalian cells, deficiency of PSEN1 also causes the defect in the proteolytic release of NICD from a truncated Notch construct. The same step can be also blocked by several gamma-secretase inhibitors, shown in the same study. These evidences collectively suggest a critical role of presenilin 1 in the Notch signaling pathway. = Wnt signaling pathway = Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in several critical steps in embryogenesis and development. Presenilin 1 has been shown to form a complex with beta-catenin, an important component in Wnt signaling, and stabilize beta-catenin. Mutant of presenilin-1 that reduces the ability to stabilize beta-catenin complex leads to hyperactive degradation of beta-catenin in the brains of transgenic mice. Considered as a negative regulator in wnt signaling pathway, presenilin-1 was also found to play a role in beta-catenin phosphorylation. Beta-catenin is coupled by presenilin-1 and undergoes a sequential phosphorylation by two kinase activities. The study also further illustrates that the deficiency of presenilin 1 disconnects the sequential phosphorylation and thus disrupts the normal wnt signaling pathway.  Clinical significance  = Beta-amyloid production = Transgenic mice that over-expressed mutant presenilin-1 show an increase of beta-amyloid-42(43) in the brain, which suggest presenilin-1 plays an important role in beta-amyloid regulation and can be highly related to Alzheimer's disease. Further study conducted in neuronal cultures derived from presenilin-1 deficient mouse embryos. They showed that cleavage by alpha- and beta- secretase was still normal without the presence of presenilin-1. Meanwhile, the cleavage by gamma-cleavage of the transmembrane domain of APP was abolished. A 5-fold drop of amyloid peptide was observed, suggesting that deficiency of presenilin-1 can down regulate amyloid and inhibition of presenilin-1 can be a potential method for anti-amyloidogenic therapy in Alzheimer's disease. Extensive study on the role of presenilin-1 in amyloid production has been conducted to improve our understanding of Alzheimer's disease. = Alzheimer's disease = Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease may carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased production of the longer form of amyloid beta (main component of amyloid deposits found in AD brains). These mutations result in early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, which is a rare form of the disease. These rare genetic variants are autosomal dominant. = Cancer = In addition to its role in Alzheimer's disease, presenilin-1 also found to be important in cancer. A study of broad range gene expression was conducted on human malignant melanoma. Researchers classified the malignant melanoma cell lines into two types. The study showed that presenilin-1 is down regulated in cell type while it is overexpressed in the other cell type. Another study on multidrug resistance (MDR) cell line also reveals a role of presenilin-1 in cancer development. Because of the development to the resistance to chemical, MDR cells become a critical factor on the success of cancer chemotherapy. In the study, researchers tried to explore the molecular mechanism by looking into the expression of Notch1 intracellular (N1IC) domain and presenilin 1. They found that there is higher level expression of both proteins and a multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (ABCC1) was also found to be regulated by N1IC, which suggest a mechanism of ABCC1 regulated by presenilin 1 and notch signaling.

History  Kaufungen deed of gift of Henry II, 1019 In May 1017 Cunigunde was staying on the imperial estate of Kaufungen when, according to Thietmar of Merseburg, she became seriously ill and vowed to found a monastery if she recovered. She did so and her husband Henry endowed the new foundation in 1019. After the death of Henry in 1024, Cunigunde, who was later canonized as well as her husband, became a nun in the new Benedictine monastery, where she died in 1033. The abbey church was consecrated on 13 July 1025. In 1089, the nunnery became an Imperial abbey, territorially and judicially independent, subject only to the Holy Roman Emperor . The \\"V√∂gte\\" (advocates, or lords protectors) of Kaufungen Abbey were the Counts of Maden. During the 12th century, the abbey was transformed to house a community of secular canonesses, becoming a home for unmarried female members of the nobility (Frauenstift). It continued in this form until 1509, when, at the instigation of William II, Landgrave of Hesse, the abbey was returned to the Benedictine Order, under the authority of the Bursfeld Congregation. The canonesses were formed into Benedictines by nuns from Gehrden Abbey. In 1532, during the Protestant Reformation, Count Philip I of Hesse appropriated it and gave it, together with Wetter Abbey, to the Hessische Ritterschaft (Hessian Knighthood, an association of noble families for the purpose of mutual help) for the care and shelter of female members of those families belonging to it. As the Ritterschaftliches Stift Kaufungen it still exists today.  Church  The abbey church, now known as the \\"Stiftskirche\\", was dedicated on 13 July 1025. It is now used as the parish church and is counted as the most significant structure of the late Ottonian period in north Hesse.

This enzyme is one of three isoforms that synthesize nitric oxide (NO), a small gaseous and lipophilic molecule that participates in several biological processes. The other isoforms include neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is constitutively expressed in specific neurons of the brain and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), whose expression is typically induced in inflammatory diseases. eNOS is primarily responsible for the generation of NO in the vascular endothelium, a monolayer of flat cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels, at the interface between circulating blood in the lumen and the remainder of the vessel wall. NO produced by eNOS in the vascular endothelium plays crucial roles in regulating vascular tone, cellular proliferation, leukocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation. Therefore, a functional eNOS is essential for a healthy cardiovascular system.  Structure and catalytic activities  eNOS is a dimer containing two identical monomers of 134 kD constituted by a reductase domain, which displays binding sites for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and an oxidase domain, which displays binding sites for heme group, zinc, the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and the substrate L-arginine. The reductase domain is linked to the oxidase domain by a calmodulin-binding sequence. In the vascular endothelium, NO is synthesized by eNOS from L-arginine and molecular oxygen, which binds to the heme group of eNOS, is reduced and finally incorporated into L- arginine to form NO and L-citrulline. The binding of the cofactor BH4 is essential for eNOS to efficiently generate NO. In the absence of this cofactor, eNOS shifts from a dimeric to a monomeric form, thus becoming uncoupled. In this conformation, instead of synthesizing NO, eNOS produces superoxide anion, a highly reactive free radical with deleterious consequences to the cardiovascular system.  Function  eNOS has a protective function in the cardiovascular system, which is attributed to NO production. Regulation of the vascular tone is one of the best known roles of NO in the cardiovascular system. Once produced in endothelial cells, NO diffuses across the vascular smooth muscle cell membranes and activates the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP, in turn, activates protein kinase G (PKG), which promotes multiple phosphorylation of cellular targets lowering cellular Ca2+ concentrations and promoting vascular relaxation. NO exerts antiproliferative effects by cGMP-dependent inhibiting Ca2+ influx or by directly inhibiting the activity of arginase and ornithine decarboxylase, decreasing the generation of polyamides required for DNA synthesis. NO also has antithrombotic effects that result of its diffusion across platelet membrane and sGC activation, resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation. Moreover, NO affects leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Œ∫B), which induces vascular endothelial expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules. In addition to these functions, NO produced by eNOS has antioxidant properties as it reduces superoxide anion formation as a result of NO-induced increases in the expression of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, part of antioxidants properties of NO is attributable to up-regulation of heme- oxygenase-I and ferritin expression, which reduce superoxide anion concentrations in blood vessels.  Regulation  eNOS expression and activity are carefully controlled by multiple interconnected mechanisms of regulation present at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels. Binding of transcription factors such as Sp1, Sp3, Ets-1, Elf-1, and YY1 to the NOS3 promoter and DNA methylation represents an important mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Posttranscriptionally, eNOS is regulated by modifications of the primary transcript, mRNA stability, subcellular localization, and nucleocytoplasmatic transport. Posttranslational modifications of eNOS include fatty acid acylation, protein-protein interactions, substrate, and co-factor availability, and degree of phosphorylation. Importantly, eNOS is attached by myristoylation and palmitoylation to caveolae, a pocket-like invagination on the membrane rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. With the binding of eNOS to caveolae, the enzyme is inactivated due to the strong and direct interaction of eNOS with caveolin-1. The binding of calcium-activated calmodulin to eNOS displaces caveolin-1 and activates eNOS. Moreover, eNOS activation is dynamically regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites at tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues.  Clinical significance  Impaired NO production is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, erectile dysfunction, and migraine. In this regard, a large number of studies showed that polymorphisms in NOS3 gene affect the susceptibility to these diseases. Although NOS3 is a highly polymorphic gene, three genetic polymorphisms in this gene have been widely studied: the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) g.-786T>C (where \\"g.\\" denotes genomic change which results in a Glu298Asp change in the coded protein), located in NOS3 promoter and in exon 7, respectively, and the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) characterized by 27 bp repeat in intron 4. The C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism, which results in reduced eNOS expression and NO production, was associated with increased risk for hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetic nephropathy, and retinopathy, migraine, and erectile dysfunction. The presence of ‚ÄòAsp‚Äô allele for the Glu298Asp polymorphism reduces eNOS activity, and was associated with higher susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, migraine, and erectile dysfunction. The VNTR in intron 4 affects eNOS expression, and the susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Growing evidence supports the association of diseases with NOS3 haplotypes (combination of alleles in close proximity, within a DNA block). This approach may be more informative than the analysis of genetic polymorphisms one by one. Haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 affected the susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, and hypertension in diabetic subjects. NOS3 variants may also affect the responses to drugs that affect NO signaling, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (PDE5i). Statin treatment was more effective in increasing NO bioavailability in subjects carrying the CC genotype for the g.-786T>C polymorphism than in TT carriers. Hypertensive patients carrying the TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better antihypertensive responses to ACEi enalapril. Likewise, patients with erectile dysfunction carrying the C allele for g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better responses to PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil. Together, these studies suggest that statins, ACEi and PDE-5 inhibitors may restore an impaired NO production in subjects carrying the variant allele/genotype for g.-786T>C NOS3 polymorphism, thus attenuating the cardiovascular risk. In addition to analysis of genetic polymorphisms individually, haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 were shown to affect the responses to sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction.

She later served prominently in the Union Navy during the American Civil War. Under charter to the Navy as M. W. Chapin Anacostia‚Äîa screw steamer built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1856 as M. W. Chapin‚Äîoriginally operated out of Middletown, Connecticut, as a merchant tug. During subsequent service as a canal boat, the vessel caught the eye of the Federal Government which chartered her sometime in September 1858‚Äîquite possibly on the 13th of that month‚Äîfor its forthcoming expedition to South American waters. Problems with Paraguay The historically cordial relations between Paraguay and the United States had soured in the summer and autumn of 1854 when the American consul, Edward A. Hopkins, fell out of the favor of Paraguay's Permanent President, Carlos Antonio L√≥pez. Their growing animosity prompted the dictator to turn against the continuation of surveying operations‚Äîwhich he had previously heartily endorsed‚Äîthen being conducted in the tributaries of the Rio de la Plata by the American Navy's side-wheel steamer, . The hostility reached a climax on 1 February 1855 when Paraguayan batteries at Itapiru‚Äîa brick fortress on the northern bank of the Upper Paran√° River‚Äîopened fire upon that small American warship, hitting her 10 times and killing her helmsman. Prolonged, but fruitless, efforts seeking redress through diplomatic measures ensued. Finally, on 9 September 1858, President James Buchanan turned the matter over to James B. Bowlin, a former congressman from Missouri, and sent him to Paraguay to obtain satisfaction. To lend credibility and force to Bowlin's demands, the President ordered the Navy to establish a force which could compel compliance. However, only a couple of sailing ships were then assigned to the Brazil station; and few light-draft, naval steamers were available elsewhere. To fill this need, the Navy chartered seven steam- propelled merchant ships for the expedition. Among these vessels was M. W. Chapin which, like her sisters, had been chosen because of her ability to negotiate shallow, tortuous, and rapidly flowing, waters far from the sea. The expedition‚Äîcommanded by Flag Officer William B. Shubrick‚Äîdeparted New York on 17 October; but, for the most part, its 19 ships proceeded southward independently. Under the command of Lt. William Ronckendorff, M. W. Chapin ‚Äî the smallest of the vessels and the last to reach the mouth of the Rio de la Plata ‚Äî arrived at Montevideo, Uruguay, on 29 December. The next day, all but two of the shallow-draft ships began their ascent of the river toward Paraguay. Steam launches manned by volunteers from the deep-draft ships joined them for the voyage upriver. Upon reaching Rosario, Water Witch and left their companions behind and continued on to Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, with Bowlin and Shubrick. They reached the Paraguayan capital on 25 January 1859. A fortnight's negotiations‚Äîaided by the knowledge that the balance of Shubrick's force was nearby ready to launch offensive operations should such measures be needed‚Äîresolved the disputes to Bowlin's satisfaction, and the two American steamers headed downriver on 10 February. Meanwhile, M. W. Chapin and had acted as dispatch boats maintaining communications between the large ships at Montevideo, Uruguay, and the smaller ones upstream. Upon the successful completion of their mission to South America, the ships not assigned to the Brazil Squadron returned home where the Navy exercised its purchase option by buying all seven of the chartered steamers. No document giving the exact date of M. W. Chapin's transfer of title has been found; but the sale probably took place on, or sometime soon after, 27 May 1859, the day of the ship's last log entry under her original name. M. W. Chapin becomes the USS Anacostia The first volumes of the steamer's logs under the name Anacostia‚Äîwhich she received upon becoming Navy property or soon thereafter‚Äîhave been lost. In any case, we know that the vessel was assigned to the Washington Navy Yard‚Äîlocated on the north bank of the river which gave the ship her Navy name. She was still serving there as a tender when the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency on 6 November 1860 precipitated the secession crisis and set the United States on an inexorable course toward civil war. Fears for the defense of Washington, D.C. A strong air of expectancy in the National Capital is normal during the months between a President's election and his ensuing inauguration. But, in this instance, the withdrawal of cotton-belt states from the Union greatly intensified the customary disquiet and transmuted into it a deep and widespread anxiety concerning the safety of the city. Washington's location on the river separating the Southern states of Maryland and Virginia prompted fears that Confederate sympathizers might attempt to prevent Lincoln's inauguration and try to take possession of the city. Thus, as early as 8 January 1861, the commandant of the Washington Navy Yard, Capt. Franklin Buchanan, warned Comdr. John A. Dahlgren, the head of the Bureau of Ordnance, that a mob might \\". . . attempt to possess themselves of this yard between now and the 4th of March next for the purpose of securing the arms and ammunition now in the armory and magazine, to be used in preventing the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln . . . .\\"To prepare to deal with that extremity, or with other similar emergencies which might arise, Anacostia -- commanded by Lt. Thomas Scott Fillebrown -- was \\". . . kept in readiness ... to receive on board the powder from the main magazine . . . .\\" Buchanan also stated that he would \\". . . require all . . . under my command to defend it [the yard] to the last extremity.\\" The apprehension of an impending attack continued to grow. On 1 February Buchanan issued a general order assigning the officers under his command various parts of the yard to defend. Lt. Fillebrown of Anacostia was given responsibility for fighting off anyone threatening \\". . . the lower part of the yard.\\" Civil War =Fort Sumter surrenders and Virginia secedes= Although the feared attacks did not occur when Lincoln took office, tension continued to grow in the weeks that followed; and the tempo of ominous events accelerated after the surrender of Fort Sumter. On 15 April, Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring that an insurrection existed and calling forth \\". . . the militia of the several states of the Union . . .\\"to restore Federal authority. His action aroused bitter resentment along the border between the North and the South. Two days later, the Virginia State Convention voted to secede. On the 19th, the President declared a blockade of the Confederate States. That same day, Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles -- fearing that Virginians would capture the Norfolk Navy Yard -- ordered Anacostia to receive on board incendiary material and explosives and to take them to Norfolk, Virginia, so that, if necessary, the commandant of the navy yard there might destroy all public property within his command to prevent \\". . . its falling into the hands of lawless persons.\\" However, before Anacostia had finished taking on her highly combustible cargo, returned from her futile relief expedition to Charleston Harbor. Since she was larger, that screw sloop was capable of carrying more cargo than Anacostia; and, since her engines were far more powerful, she was better able to tow warships then under repair out of the threatened, and soon-to-be-abandoned, Norfolk Navy Yard. Pawnee's advantages prompted Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, to order her to go to Norfolk in place of Anacostia. The latter steamer quickly transferred her inflammable cargo and her pilot to the larger vessel which then sped to Hampton Roads. =Potomac River= Fear of losing Baltimore underscores need to keep Potomac open Meanwhile, another crisis threatened immediate harm to the Union. In Baltimore, Maryland, on that same day, 19 April, a violently pro-Southern mob attacked the 6th Massachusetts Regiment as it was moving between railroad stations during its trip to Washington to defend the Federal Capital. This serious threat to lines of communications and supply linking Washington with the North by rail underscored the importance of keeping the Potomac open to Federal shipping. Anacostia positions herself on the Potomac As a result, Anacostia headed down the Potomac River to learn of any obstruction which Confederates might have placed in the channel; to look for signs of any Southern efforts to erect batteries along the banks of the river; and, if possible, to destroy any fortifications discovered. To assist her in carrying out the latter mission, she embarked a guard of 20 United States Marines before getting underway. Since Fillebrown needed a pilot to descend the river below Cedar Point safely, he reversed course upon reaching that place, lest his ship run aground and fall into enemy hands. During her homeward passage, Anacostia escorted two vessels: the steamer Jerome; carrying 144 barrels of gunpowder along with\\". . . other stores for the Government . . .\\"and\\". . . a large schooner laden with cement and other matter for the United States Capitol\\" which was then being enlarged. Upon reaching Washington, Fillebrown reported that he had found neither channel obstructions nor evidence of shore batteries. He went on to ask that \\". . . at least one other responsible officer be ordered to this vessel as the constant and unremitting attention that is necessary to the proper execution of my orders is more than nature will stand. I have not laid myself down since Thursday [five days before] night.\\" No records tell us whether or not Fillebrown received the needed help. In any case, Anacostia soon resumed her patrolling of the Potomac and stuck to the task through the early weeks of the war. Anacostia discovers batteries being built on the Virginia shore  Anacostia would typically depart the Washington Navy Yard and carefully observe both banks as she proceeded downstream. Occasionally, she ventured all the way to Point Lookout, Maryland; but usually reversed course before reaching the mouth of the Potomac and steamed back to the navy yard where she replenished her bunkers with coal and quickly began another cycle. During one of his ship's reconnaissance runs downriver in mid-May, Fillebrown learned from the side-wheeler Mount Vernon that Confederate forces had emplaced cannon at the mouth of Aquia Creek. Disturbed at this intelligence, he immediately headed Anacostia back to Washington to report the discovery. The news presented Lincoln‚Äîalready overburdened by many other highly dangerous problems‚Äîwith an extremely exasperating dilemma. If he ordered Federal forces to attack the fortifications which were going up on the southern bank of the Potomac, he would assuredly offend many still loyal, but wavering, Virginians and would influence them to vote to withdraw from the Union in the forthcoming plebiscite on their state convention's ordinance of secession. On the other hand, if he did not move against the new batteries before they had been completed and strengthened, he would place Union use of the Potomac‚Äîand thus the National Capital and the whole Union cause‚Äîin grave jeopardy. Temporizing, the President decided to leave all Virginia territory‚Äîriverside guns notwithstanding‚Äîinviolate until the people of that state had spoken. For the time being, no action would be taken against the ordnance threatening Washington's waterborne communication with the rest of the world. Navigational aids on the Potomac appear sabotaged To make matters worse, the riverside batteries were not the only hazards facing Union shipping on the Potomac. Southern agents had removed the buoys and other navigational aids from the river. To counter this threat, the Navy selected Lt. Thomas Phelps to make a new survey of the Potomac. As he carried out this work, Anacostia and shared the task of carrying him upstream and downstream while he made the observations needed to prepare new charts showing permanent landmarks ashore‚Äîwhich could be neither moved nor removed‚Äî rather than movable markers in the water. These new maps made it possible for navigators to keep their vessels safely in the channel as they operated between Washington and Point Lookout. Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia, occupied by Federal troops The immunity from Federal attack at first enjoyed by Confederate forces in Virginia ended abruptly on 23 May, when the citizens of the Old Dominion overwhelmingly endorsed secession. After losing this critical plebiscite, the Lincoln Government wasted no time in moving to check the growing threat to the National Capital from the south bank of the Potomac. That very night, troops left Washington and occupied Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia. Some subsequent studies state that Anacostia joined and in carrying the Union occupation forces to Alexandria and in covering their landings. However, no contemporary documents supporting her participation in the operation have been found. Moreover, it seems unlikely that Anacostia took part since she departed the Washington Navy Yard that morning and headed for the mouth of the Potomac to escort the steamer Sea Gull back to the capital. They arrived there on the night of the 27th. Soon after reaching home, Anacostia welcomed on board Lt. Napoleon Collins who relieved Lt. Fillebrown in command. While she was at the navy yard, she also exchanged her Marine Corps guard for one composed of soldiers from the 71st New York Regiment. The Potomac Flotilla is established Three days later, the steamer again moved downriver, first to Nanjemoy Creek to communicate with Comdr. James Harmon Ward, the commanding officer of the recently established Potomac Flotilla, and then to enforce the blockade of the Virginia shore further below. Anacostia met Thomas Freeborn, the flotilla's flagship, on the morning of 31 May, just as Ward was preparing to resume shelling the new Southern works at the mouth of Aquia Creek. During the bombardment, she added her guns to those of Freeborn and Resolute. At least two of Anacostia's shells exploded within the battery and did considerable material damage; but, unaccountably, wounded no one. Confederate counterbattery fire struck Ward's ships several times, but wounded only one man and did no serious material damage. That evening the Union steamers withdrew a few miles downstream where they were reinforced by . The next day, the Federal warships moved back upriver to a point just off the mouth of Aquia Creek and again opened fire. In compliance with Ward's orders, Anacostia and Resolute did not join in the cannonade, but remained just out of range of the Confederate artillery so that they would be ready to tow any of their consorts out of danger in the event one or both became disabled during the engagement. In the course of the five-hour action, many rounds from ashore did strike both Thomas Freeborn and Pawnee, causing Ward to return to Washington in the former for repairs and replenishment. Anacostia also headed back to the navy yard where she arrived on the evening of 1 June. =Assigned temporary duty at Fort Monroe= A few days later, while she was inspecting shipping in the Potomac, the steamer received orders sending her to Fort Monroe to relieve the tug, , which needed repairs. She arrived in Hampton Roads on the 7th and served in that strategic harbor supporting the blockade through the first three weeks of August and then returned to Washington for yard work which she also needed. =Anacostia returns to Potomac River guard duty= When again ready for action, she resumed patrol duty on the Potomac. From time to time during the following months, the ship shelled Confederate forces along the Virginia shore. On 8 December 1861, she and fired on Southern troops near Freestone Point. After the bombardment had driven off the Confederate soldiers, a party from the steamers landed there and burned down several buildings. Then, on 31 January 1862, Anacostia and engaged cannon at Cockpit Point, dismounting at least one Southern gun and silencing the battery. The ships returned to that place on 9 March‚Äîthe day of the historic battle at Hampton Roads between CSS Virginia, the raised and rebuilt Merrimack and ‚Äîbut found the Southern positions deserted. Parties from the Union warship then landed and spiked the abandoned guns. Later that day, the same raiders destroyed Confederate batteries at Evansport, Virginia. =Supporting General McClellan's operations= About this time, General George B. McClellan was making final preparations for moving the Army of the Potomac from its positions in Northern Virginia to the tip of the peninsula formed by the James and York Rivers to launch a new drive toward Richmond, Virginia, from that quarter. Anacostia's next assignment took her back and forth between Washington and Hampton Roads on runs escorting Army transports carrying McCellan's troops to Fort Monroe for the impending campaign. When she had completed that duty, the ship turned her attention to reconnaissance work along the lower western shore of the Chesapeake Bay in the Piankatank River; Mobjack Bay; and, especially, the York River which the Yankee Army was then using as its line of supply during its push up the peninsula. In response to a request from McClellan\\". . . to annoy the enemy . . .\\"she shelled both Gloucester, Virginia, and Yorktown, Virginia on the night of 15 and 16 April. Following this action, Anacostia headed back up Chesapeake Bay and, on the 20th, assisted other vessels of the Potomac Flotilla in capturing the steamer Eureka in the Rappahannock River. She took another prize early in June when she caught the sloop Monitor while that Southern sailing ship was attempting to escape from the Piankatank River. About this time, a party from Anacostia ventured several miles inland to recapture the reflectors which had been taken from one of the Chesapeake Bay light boats. Late in June, General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia turned back McClellan's thrust toward Richmond, Virginia, and forced the Union general to shift his base from the York to the James. The Union reverses on the peninsula prompted Washington to bring Major General Ambrose Burnside's troops from the Carolinas to Northern Virginia where they could join John Pope's Army in defending Washington. Anacostia in turn was ordered up the Rappahannock to keep in touch with Burnside. Burning wood for want of coal, she arrived at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on 14 July and remained there subject to Burnside's orders. =Anacostia's raid on Port Royal, Virginia= A month later, in response to intelligence from the general that clandestine lines of communication between Baltimore and Richmond passed through Port Royal, Virginia, some 35 miles below Fredericksburg, Virginia, a party from Anacostia boarded the ferry at Cooper's Point and dropped downriver to that port. There, they arrested two groups of recruits going South from Maryland to join the Confederate Army. They also destroyed both the ferry that the Southerners used to cross the river and a number of other craft that were potentially useful to the Confederate cause. About a fortnight later, another party from Anacostia returned to Port Royal and captured another group of recruits and the officers who were in charge of them. =Anacostia called back to Washington after Union loss at Bull Run= On the day Acting Master Nelson Provost, who had relieved Collins in command of Anacostia, reported the latter raid, Lee's army launched an offensive which routed Union troops in the Second Battle of Bull Run and seriously threatened Washington. As a result, Burnside asked Anacostia to return to the Potomac and wired Washington for more naval help. \\"I ought to have more gunboats here. It is an absolute necessity.\\" In response, Anacostia blew up the bridges across the Rappahannock River, set fire to a sloop, and headed downstream from Fredericksburg. When she was still some 20 miles from the mouth of the Potomac, her engine broke down and, instead of taking station off the mouth of Aquia Creek, she had to go all the way upriver to Washington for repairs. The ensuing overhaul kept the ship inactive during the naval alert attendant upon the Battle of Antietam and through mid-October. =Anacostia raids St. George's Island= Upon the completion of this yard work, the steamer dropped downstream and took station off Piney Point, Maryland., where she could observe shipping entering and leaving the Potomac River and could interrupt traffic across the river between Maryland and Virginia. In mid-November, Provost led a boat expedition to St. George's Island and captured several Southern smugglers, two canoes, and \\"... a quantity of contraband goods.\\" About a week later, the ship‚Äîaccompanied by four other ships of the flotilla‚Äîreturned to the Rappahannock River behind which Burnside, who had relieved McClellan in command of the Army of the Potomac, was assembling forces in a position to protect Washington while pushing toward Richmond. However, the low level of the tidal water slowed the Union gunboats' progress up that river and stopped their ascent at Port Royal before dawn on the 27th. At that point, the senior naval officer, Lt. Comdr. Edward P. McCrea reported to Burnside the arrival of his ships and asked for instructions. On the afternoon of 4 December, Southern field artillery opened fire on Anacostia and three other Union ships, beginning a series of engagements which continued until Burnside's Army‚Äîwhich had crossed the Rappahannock on the 12th‚Äîwas defeated in the Battle of Fredericksburg on the 13th. Burnside's beaten troops retired eastward across the river on the night of the 14th and 15th. Nevertheless, Anacostia remained in the Rappahannock for more than a week thereafter, observing the activities of Lee's troops. On the 23d, she stood downstream to return to the Potomac. =Subsequent operations on the Potomac River= The steamer's subsequent movements were somewhat less tied to Army operations. During the ensuing two and one-half years, she primarily plied the waters of the lower Potomac and its tributaries, occasionally leaving that river for brief missions which took her from its mouth south along the western shore of the Chesapeake and up the other streams which flow into that bay, especially the Rappahannock and the Piankatank Rivers. On 28 December 1862, she captured the schooner Exchange in the Rappahannock. From time to time, parties from the ship went ashore in Confederate territory and captured men, materiel, and equipment. For instance, acting on an intelligence report from the Army, parties from Anacostia and landed at Indian Creek, Virginia, on 3 April 1863 to find a large quantity of smuggled medical supplies. They arrived after the drugs had been shipped on to Richmond, but did manage to capture a large quantity of tobacco. On other occasions, she gathered information for the Northern Army. This was the case during a trip up the Rappahannock with about a fortnight before the Battle of Chancellorsville. Similar instances abound. Taken individually, these operations were, for the most part, of little significance. Yet, Anacostia's labors, combined with the countless like efforts of her sister ships in the Union Navy to exact a growing and enervating toll on the South's steadily shrinking ability to fight. On 21 May, Anacostia, , and took the schooner Emily on the Rappahannock about 10 miles above Urbana, Virginia. On 1 June, she helped to cover Kilpatrick's cavalry brigade as if crossed the Rappahannock. The next day, she and captured the sloop Flying Cloud. On 16 July in Herring Creek, Maryland, she took and destroyed a canoe and captured the men who had just crossed the Potomac in it to purchase goods needed by the South. On 7 November 1864 near Aquia Creek, a party from Anacostia destroyed two wagons which had been used to convey blockade goods from that place to Fredericksburg. Two days later, another group of her sailors ascended Chopawamsic Creek where they burned the sloop Buckskin. =Final months of the war= During the final months of the Civil War, Anacostia encountered steadily decreasing Southern activity. However, the fear and tension following Lincoln's assassination in mid-April gave increased purpose and excitement to her last weeks of duty as her crew remained alert for any conspirators who might attempt to escape down or across the Potomac. End-of-war decommissioning Following the complete collapse of the Confederacy, the steamer was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 12 June 1865. She was sold at public auction there on 20 July 1865 to a Mr. Clyde and was redocumented as Alexandria on 26 December 1865. She subsequently served in the Chesapeake Bay area until destroyed by fire at City Point, Virginia, on 22 March 1868.

It was more than a warmed-over KZ750, as it was improved in many areas, focusing on high-performance. Changes started at the front, with tapered bearings in the steering head instead of the KZ750's ball bearings, and the upper triple clamp was changed also, giving the GPz solid aluminum clip-on handle grips instead of the traditional handlebar. A bikini fairing almost identical to the one on the GPz550 was added too. The GPz750 boasted increased power, with slightly higher compression, and camshafts designed to get the valves to full lift quicker, and fitting Mikuni 34mm carburetors to it for smoother airflow. The cylinder heads were also given a new combustion chamber with a 'squish zone' and porting & polishing from the factory. To maintain reliability oil passages were installed under the pistons for increased cooling, and an oil-cooler was added. The GPz750 was the quickest factory 750, as Cycle World recorded a time of 11.93 seconds at in the 1/4 mile. The GPz750 underwent some significant changes in 1983. The original was based on the 1981 KZ750-E. Kawasaki retired the KZ750 after 1983. The 1983 KZ750L3 was nearly identical to the '82 GPz750, but for different colors, no bikini fairing, and without the porting & polishing in the cylinder head. In 1983, the engine was modified further, mostly in the combustion chamber, and an all-new frame was used with Uni-Trak suspension. There were also modifications to the suspension, brakes and wheels, as well as the bodywork. The bike became more sport-oriented, but lost some of the versatility of the '82.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family. MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act in a signaling cascade that regulates various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle progression in response to a variety of extracellular signals. This kinase is activated by upstream kinases, resulting in its translocation to the nucleus where it phosphorylates nuclear targets.

When the coupling is strong enough and the frequencies near enough, the second oscillator can capture the first oscillator, causing it to have essentially identical frequency as the second. This is injection locking. When the second oscillator merely disturbs the first but does not capture it, the effect is called injection pulling. Injection locking and pulling effects are observed in numerous types of physical systems, however the terms are most often associated with electronic oscillators or laser resonators. Injection locking has been used in beneficial and clever ways in the design of early television sets and oscilloscopes, allowing the equipment to be synchronized to external signals at a relatively low cost. Injection locking has also been used in high performance frequency doubling circuits. However, injection locking and pulling, when unintended, can degrade the performance of phase-locked loops and RF integrated circuits. Injection from grandfather clocks to lasers Injection pulling and injection locking can be observed in numerous physical systems where pairs of oscillators are coupled together. Perhaps the first to document these effects was Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock, who was surprised to note that two pendulum clocks which normally would keep slightly different time nonetheless became perfectly synchronized when hung from a common beam. Modern researchers have confirmed his suspicion that the pendulums were coupled by tiny back-and- forth vibrations in the wooden beam.http://phys.org/news/2016-03-huygens- pendulum-synchronization.html - Researchers prove Huygens was right about pendulum synchronization The two clocks became injection locked to a common frequency. Cross coupled LC oscillator with output on top In a modern-day voltage-controlled oscillator an injection-locking signal may override its low-frequency control voltage, resulting in loss of control. When intentionally employed, injection locking provides a means to significantly reduce power consumption and possibly reduce phase noise in comparison to other frequency synthesizer and PLL design techniques. In similar fashion, the frequency output of large lasers can be purified by injection locking them with high accuracy reference lasers (see injection seeder). Injection-locked oscillator An injection-locked oscillator (ILO) is usually based on cross- coupled LC oscillator. It has been employed for frequency division or jitter reduction in PLL, with the input of pure sinusoidal waveform. It was employed in continuous mode clock and data recovery (CDR) or clock recovery to perform clock restoration from the aid of either preceding pulse generation circuit to convert non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data to pseudo-return-to-zero (PRZ) format or nonideal retiming circuit residing at the transmitter side to couple the clock signal into the data.[54] T. Gabara, \\"An 0.25 Œºm CMOS injection locked 5.6 Gbit/s clock and data recovery cell,\\" in Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design 1999, pp. 84 - 87. Recently, the ILO was employed for burst mode clock recovery scheme.J. Lee and M. Liu, \\"A 20Gbit/s burst-mode CDR circuit using injection-locking technique,\\" in IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), pp. 46‚Äì586, 2007. The operation of ILO is based on the fact that the local oscillation can be locked to the frequency and phase of external injection signal under proper conditions. Unwanted injection locking High-speed logic signals and their harmonics are potential threats to an oscillator. The leakage of these and other high frequency signals into an oscillator through a substrate concomitant with an unintended lock is unwanted injection locking. Gain by injection locking Injection locking can also provide a means of gain at a low power cost in certain applications. Injection pulling Injection (aka frequency) pulling occurs when an interfering frequency source disturbs an oscillator but is unable to injection lock it. The frequency of the oscillator is pulled towards the frequency source as can be seen in the spectrogram. The failure to lock may be due to insufficient coupling, or because the injection source frequency lies outside the locking window of the oscillator. Spectrogram of the above audio Entrainment Entrainment has been used to refer to the process of mode locking of coupled driven oscillators, which is the process whereby two interacting oscillating systems, which have different periods when they function independently, assume a common period. The two oscillators may fall into synchrony, but other phase relationships are also possible. The system with the greater frequency slows down, and the other speeds up. Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock, introduced the concept after he noticed, in 1666, that the pendulums of two clocks mounted on a common board had synchronized, and subsequent experiments duplicated this phenomenon. He described this effect as \\"odd sympathy\\". The two pendulum clocks synchronized with their pendulums swinging in opposite directions, 180¬∞ out of phase, but in-phase states can also result. Entrainment occurs because small amounts of energy are transferred between the two systems when they are out of phase in such a way as to produce negative feedback. As they assume a more stable phase relationship, the amount of energy gradually reduces to zero. In the realm of physics, Huygens' observations are related to resonance and the resonant coupling of harmonic oscillators, which also gives rise to sympathetic vibrations. A 2002 study of Huygens' observations show that an antiphase stable oscillation was somewhat fortuitous, and that there are other possible stable solutions, including a \\"death state\\" where a clock stops running, depending on the strength of the coupling between the clocks. Mode locking between driven oscillators can be easily demonstrated using mechanical metronomes on a common, easily movable surface.Watch the synchronization of 32 metronomes CBS News, 2013 Sept 10 Such mode locking is important for many biological systems including the proper operation of pacemakers. The use of the word entrainment in the modern Physics literature most often refers to the movement of one fluid, or collection of particulates, by another (see Entrainment (hydrodynamics)). The use of the word to refer to mode locking of non-linear coupled oscillators appears mostly after about 1980, and remains relatively rare in comparison. A similar coupling phenomenon was characterized in hearing aids when the adaptive feedback cancellation is used. This chaotic artifact (entrainment) is observed when correlated input signals are presented to an adaptive feedback canceller. In recent years, aperiodic entrainment has been identified as an alternative form of entrainment that is of interest in biological rhythms.

A party must run a gubernatorial candidate (as well as a lieutenant governor candidate, although the state will accept petitions without a lieutenant governor candidate if no other candidate challenges them) to be eligible for automatic ballot access; if 50,000 voters vote for that candidate on their party line, they have qualified the party for the next four general elections. A party that is not qualified may run candidates by completing a petition process. Parties are also allowed to cross-endorse candidates, whose votes are accumulated under electoral fusion, but any parties must cross-endorse both the governor and lieutenant governor candidates for fusion to apply. Parties that are already qualified must issue a Wilson Pakula authorization if they cross-endorse someone not enrolled in that party; there are no restrictions (other than that the candidate must be eligible for office) on who can be nominated on a non-qualified ballot line, as these lines are determined by filing petitions. For statewide and special elections, automatic ballot access means that no petitions have to be filed to gain access to a ballot line, and party organizations can endorse candidates through their own conventions (this does not apply to legislative candidates, who still must petition onto the ballot regardless of party endorsement, but are only required to collect a third of the signatures required of non-qualified parties). Qualified parties also are the only parties eligible to hold primary elections in the state-run primary elections. In addition to determining whether they automatically qualify for the next four years, this also determines the order on the ballot; qualified parties are ranked in order of gubernatorial votes, with the party having the most votes atop the ballot. In the 1994 election, the Democratic Party received the most votes, and so qualified to be first on the ballot for the next four years, even though their candidate, incumbent Governor Mario Cuomo, lost. George Pataki beat him because he received more votes combined over all of his party lines. In the 2002 election, three qualified parties failed to re-qualify: the Liberal Party, Right to Life Party, and the Green Party. The Liberals became dormant, the Right to Life dramatically scaled back its operations, while the Greens continued mostly unaffected before re- qualifying in 2010. The same five parties who qualified in 2002 re-qualified in the 2006 election. After the 2010 elections, these parties with ballot access were joined by a sixth party, the Green Party. Two additional parties qualified in the 2014 elections: the Women's Equality Party (a front for incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo) and the Stop Common Core Party (a line created by Republican candidate Rob Astorino), later renamed the Reform Party. Both parties failed to re-qualify in the 2018 elections and were replaced with the Libertarian Party and Serve America Movement party who qualified. Parties that do not qualify automatically can petition their way onto the ballot. For statewide candidates, this requires 15,000 signatures, and requires 100 signatures in at least half of the congressional districts in the state. (official site) The Socialist Workers Party regularly used this approach to appear on the ballot before abandoning its ballot-access efforts in 2010, then stopped running statewide candidates entirely in 2018. These parties also are not eligible to run primaries, and the first person to submit 15,000 signatures automatically gets the party line. (Sam Sloan attempted to use this tactic to take the 2010 and 2014 Libertarian gubernatorial nominations from that party's nominee, this before the Libertarians gained ballot access in 2018, but failed for lack of signatures.) 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 The Stop Common Core Party rechristened itself the Reform Party, initially unrelated to the national Reform Party, on February 17, 2015. In an effort to quash a trademark infringement dispute from the national Reform Party, the state party allowed national Reform Party officers, including chairman Bill Merrill, to take over the party. In September 2016, Curtis Sliwa orchestrated a hostile takeover of the Reform Party, and it is no longer related to the national party. 2018 For the first time in the 48-year history of the Libertarian Party of New York, the party qualified for automatic ballot access with Larry Sharpe's 90,816 votes. In addition, Stephanie Miner achieved automatic ballot access for the newly created Serve America Movement line. The Women's Equality Party and the Reform Party failed to re-qualify.

Mitty established the first Oxfam charity shop in Oxford. Joseph Sidney Mitty MBE (7 May 1919 - 30 September 2007) was a British salesman and the man who turned the first Oxfam gift shop into a national retail network of shops selling second hand clothing and other goods. This network put Oxfam on the high street map and has contributed substantially to Oxfam's income as well as presence in the public eye over the years. It was also an inspiration for many charities to follow Oxfam's lead. Mitty worked for Oxfam for 33 years, earned the nickname of \\"salesman of the angels\\". By 2007, there were over 700 Oxfam shops throughout the UK. Early life Joe Mitty was born on 7 May 1919, in Islington, north London. His father, an employee at Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, died when he was twelve years old and he was brought up by his mother. He attended a local Church of England school. After leaving school, Mitty became a civil service clerk. He joined the British Territorial Army in 1938, before enlisting in the 7th Battalion the Royal Berkshire Regiment in March 1939. in 1942, Mitty was admitted to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, for officer training, following which he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the British Army's Hampshire Regiment and was sent to East Asia. On his way to the Far East, Mitty travelled through India, where he was moved by the extreme poverty which he witnessed in the slums of Calcutta. In 1942, while still serving in the military, Mitty married Dorothy White. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Dorothy died in 1995. His daughter Gloria died in 1989. Mitty left the Army in 1946 and moved to Oxford with his wife. He purchased a quarter acre plot of land at Cumnor for ¬£75, and built a house, which he and his wife would live in for the next 60 years. He initially worked for the Ministry of Aircraft Production. However, in 1949 he noticed an employment advertisement in the Oxford Mail newspaper seeking an administrative assistant for the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, an organization which would later become known by its current name, Oxfam. Mitty decided to apply for this position. Oxfam and the Oxfam Charity Shop The first Oxfam shop, opened in December 1947 at 17 Broad Street, Oxford Joe Mitty was hired directly by Oxfam founder, Cecil Jackson-Cole, in 1947. Mitty was instructed to meet Jackson-Cole in the lobby of the Grosvenor Hotel, in Victoria with a handkerchief over his face. He was also told to address anyone who approached him with the question, \\"Are you Mr Jackson-Cole?\\" Mitty was hired at the hotel by Jackson-Cole and received a starting salary of a little over ¬£8 per week. This made Mitty Oxfam's first paid employee.Oxford Committee for Famine Relief Council minutes, 1946-49, Oxfam Archive Mitty's initial role at Oxfam was to oversee the distribution of donated clothing to Europeans who had been left impoverished during World War II. However, Oxfam soon saw an untapped financial potential in selling the donated clothing rather than just sending the donations to Europe. This would allow Oxfam \\"to become a shop that sold everything but bought nothing,\\" to quote The Telegraph. Proceeds from the sales of the donated goods would be used to fund Oxfam's charitable goals. Mitty's motto for the first gift shop was \\"If you donate it, we can sell it.\\" The shop took ¬£500 during its first year of operation, but by 1953 its annual profits were ¬£10,000. Mitty's success with the first Oxfam shop gave him the opportunity to oversee and open several more charity shops throughout Britain by the early 1960s. His growing success at Oxfam allowed him to recruit a number of celebrities including Harry Secombe who helped to draw attention to Oxfam's work. By 1971, Mitty's Oxfam charity shops were making over ¬£1 million and had become the largest charity shop chain in the country. Joe Mitty officially retired from Oxfam in 1982, though he continued to work as an Oxfam ambassador. In 2006, he appeared with Victoria Beckham at an Oxfam charity shop in Notting Hill where she presented him with an award and he sold her a black dress for ¬£19.99 as part of a campaign to draw attention to Oxfam's work. He also worked with the 20,000 volunteers who run Britain's over 700 Oxfam charity shops. Mitty was awarded an MBE in 2003 for his work with the Oxfam charity shops and service to Oxfam. In 2006, the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, presented Mitty with a lifetime achievement award at the TV-Daily Mirror Pride of Britain event. Blair declared to the audience that if Mitty had worked in the private sector he would have been a multi-millionaire. Carol Vorderman called Mitty \\"the grandfather of British charity shops\\" at the same awards. Quotes In a 2002 speech, Joe Mitty told a gathering of Oxfam charity shop managers that: \\"I was a sort of Christopher Columbus of the 1940s. I had no idea how to price things and when. But I had two words - rage, and passion. Rage because of the inequality and injustice in the world, and a passion to do something about it.\\" Death Joe Mitty died on 30 September 2007 at the age of 88.

The state highway runs from Interstate 70 (I-70) and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) east of Hancock north to the Pennsylvania state line, where the highway continues as State Route 2001 (SR 2001) in Fulton County. MD 615 has two sections, an east-west section that closely parallels I-70 and US 40 and a north-south highway that follows Heavenly Acres Ridge. The ridge road was constructed as MD 615 in the mid-1930s. The east-west segment is part of the original alignment of US 40 constructed in the mid-1910s. After I-70 was constructed east of Hancock in the early 1960s, MD 615 was extended to its current length parallel to the new freeway. Route description MD 615 begins at an intersection between Millstone Road, which continues east as a county highway, and the Exit 5 ramp from westbound I-70 and US 40 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). The state highway heads west as a two-lane undivided road, closely paralleling I-70 and US 40 to the south. At Hollow Road, MD 615 has a ramp to eastbound I-70 and US 40; the ramp also provides access to a parking lot for the Western Maryland Rail Trail and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The highway continues west until it intersects the ramps to and from I-70 and US 40 in the direction of Hancock. MD 615's name changes to Heavenly Acres Ridge Road and curves north to climb out of the narrow valley of the Potomac River onto Heavenly Acres Ridge. The highway follows the ridge north to its terminus at an intersection with White Oak Ridge Road at the Pennsylvania state line. Heavenly Acres Ridge Road continues north as SR 2001 in southeastern Fulton County. View north from the south end of MD 615 at I-70/US 40 east of Hancock History The Millstone Road portion of MD 615 follows a narrow corridor on the north side of the Potomac River that has carried multiple modes of transportation between Hancock and Licking Creek, where the river valley opens up. In the early 20th century, this corridor featured the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the Western Maryland Railway, and the National Pike, which ran between the canal and the railroad. When the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed the state road between Hancock and Licking Creek in 1915, the highway was placed on a new alignment north of the railroad tracks to eliminate four grade crossings. This highway was designated US 40 in 1927. The Heavenly Acres Ridge portion of MD 615 was paved from US 40 to the Pennsylvania state line in 1936. By 1939, White Oak Ridge Road was also marked as MD 615. White Oak Ridge Road retained the state highway designation until 1956. In 1960, US 40 was constructed parallel to its existing alignment as a freeway from the east end of Main Street in Hancock to what is now the eastern end of MD 615\\\\. This upgrade included the modern ramps between the freeway and Millstone Road. This freeway was marked as I-70 in addition to US 40 in 1962 and MD 615 was extended south and east from Heavenly Acres Ridge Road along its modern extent.

It follows a group of students at an elite international school in Prague who break into an indoor water park where they are stalked by a murderer. A sequel directed by Tiziano Pellegris was released in 2005.https://imdb.com/title/tt4799686/ Plot Catherine is waiting for her boyfriend to arrive at her home, where she is cooking dinner. She discovers her boyfriend's car in her driveway, and inside finds him with his throat slit. A killer wearing a skull mask breaks into the home and murders her, throwing her body in a swimming pool. Shortly after, a group of international students from an elite Prague school are graduating; among them are the American Sarah; the Irish Mike; the English Frank; Kim, an Australian; Carmen, from Germany; Diego, from Argentina; and others. To celebrate, Sarah's boyfriend Greg plans to break into an indoor swimming complex with the help of Martin, an American former student and employee of the water park, giving the friends free access to pools and water slides. On finals day, Kim is upset over failing her tests. She and Mike, her boyfriend, go swimming at a lake, and she tells him she feels like an outcast among him and his wealthy peers; she decides not to attend the party. Later, Kim is accosted in the woods by the masked killer, and stabbed to death with a machete. Late that night, the group arrive at the water park and are let inside by Martin, where they begin drinking and swimming in the pools. Svenja and Carter go to an isolated pool to ride a water slide. While Carter waits for her at the bottom, he is stabbed to death. As Svenja descends the waterslide, the killer drives a machete through the bottom of the slide; she attempts to stop but is unable to, and the machete slices through her groin. Shortly after, Carmen and Chris discover their bodies floating in the small pool. Carmen and Chris locate the remainder of the group, but they find they are unable to leave the building as the entryways have been locked. Meanwhile, Martin and Mel find an empty weight room to have sex. When Martin goes to retrieve a condom, Mel is attacked by the killer chased into a locker room where she is killed. Aware that a killer is loose, Sarah, Mike, Carmen, and Chris intercept Martin en route back to the weight room. In a panic, they rush to save Mel, but find her corpse in a bathroom stall. The group are unable to locate Greg, Frank, or Diego, and Martin finds that the lock picks and spare keys to the building have been removed; the phones have also been disconnected. Martin recalls an air duct leading out of the building, and proposes the group exit that way. He goes ahead to dismantle a vent grate, after which Sarah, Mike, and Carmen follow; Chris stays behind, as they are unable to turn around and lift him from inside the duct. As they crawl through the duct, the killer begins driving his machete through the bottom of it, killing Mike and Martin. Sarah and Carmen escape through a separate duct and find themselves in the basement, where they are confronted by the killer, who chases them through the building. They momentarily hide in a security monitor room and ponder who the killer is; Carmen believes it is Greg. Meanwhile, Diego and Greg find Chris, terrified. Greg decides to enter the air duct to find a way out, and Diego waits with Chris. Greg finds Sarah and Carmen in a room overlooking the pool. Convinced he is the killer, Carmen knocks him unconscious, and she and Sarah lock him inside. Carmen attempts to swim into a filter chamber to exit the building. She injures her leg in the process, but is able to access the exterior of the building. Outside, she finds a security guard's corpse with a gun lying next to it, but before she can retrieve it, she is stabbed by the killer and thrown back into the filter chamber. Inside, Sarah is confronted by Frank, who reveals himself to be the killer, motivated out of spite and jealousy over his failed romantic advances on each of the women. Sarah manages to douse him with vodka and light him on fire, but he leaps into the pool. Greg breaks free of the room overlooking the pool, jumping into the pool below, and the men begin to fight. Sarah enters the water and manages to stab Frank with a broken bottle. He rises from the water while Greg and Sarah attempt to flee, but is shot to death by Carmen, who survived the earlier attack. Cast Reception , Swimming Pool holds a 36% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on eleven reviews with an average rating of 5.15/10.

Description It opens with the sound of a howling wind, then the song starts after a thunder-strike, bursting into a heavy, riff-dominated rock song. At around 2:08, Rick Wakeman's piano comes in along with another few seconds of wind. At around 3:19, Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Jon Anderson start singing wordless vocal harmonies along with the piano. This continues until about 5:42, when the earlier heavy riff part returns, with the wind in the background. The song fades out in the end to the same howling wind that occurred throughout. The original and a new \\"acoustic\\" version of this song, with piano as the dominant instrument and without the sound effects, appears on the 2004 U.S. version of the three-disc compilation album The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection. This new version is on the third disc, which consists of material newly recorded for the album, while the original version of the track appears on the first. Production, lyrical content According to Jon Anderson, the inspiration for lyrics came from an article which claims that \\"sleep is death's little sister\\", and the lyrics expand on the idea that death could be beautiful. The mountain referenced in the lyrics is a goal humanity struggles to attain, after which there is death, a set of transitions leading to \\"eternal sleep or the next life span\\". Chris Squire explained that Anderson wrote the first verse with acoustic guitar; Squire takes credit for the riff in the chorus (in the words of Steve Howe, \\"do-de-do-do-do\\") and for a section in the middle of the song. The guitar riff for the song, said Steve Howe, came from a composition by his earlier band, Bodast, and the song was rarely played live because \\"the vocal section came up short\\". In the liner notes of the remastered edition of Fragile, it is said that this song is about a tragic polar expedition that ends in death, as evidenced by lyrics such as \\"A river, a mountain to be crossed/ the sunshine, in mountains sometimes lost/ around the south side, so cold that we cried\\" and \\"The moments, seem lost in all the noise/ a snow storm, a stimulating voice\\".Yes. Fragile. CD-ROM. 2003. Elektra Entertainment. In the second half of the song, the references to the cold switch to lyrics that seem to reflect hypothermia, such as \\"Of warmth of the sky/ of warmth when you die\\" and \\"Were we ever warmer on that day\\". In the introduction to this song in Yes' 2003 concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Jon Anderson said, \\"This is a song about climbing mountains... It's dangerous, but we all must climb mountains every day.\\"Yes (musical group). Yes: Live at Montreux 2003. [DVD]. Eagle Eye Media. Rick Wakeman contributed to the writing of \\"South Side of the Sky\\" (and fellow album piece \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\") by adding piano interludes to both songs, but was not credited due to contractual conflicts. Covers \\"South Side of the Sky\\" was covered by the band Spock's Beard. The song is heard on the special edition third disc of their album Snow. A cover of this song, with vocal contributions by Jon Anderson, appears as the first track on Glass Hammer's 2007 album Culture of Ascent, a concept album about mountain climbing in the Himalayas.

Individuals become eligible for listing by virtue of their positions and/or noteworthy achievements that have proved to be of significant value to society. An individual's desire to be listed is not sufficient reason for inclusion. Similarly, wealth or social position are not criteria. Purchase of the book is never a factor in the selection of biographees\\". Some insight into the selection process can be obtained from William L Hamilton's article entitled \\"Who Are You? Why Are You Here?\\" that appeared in The New York Times in 2005. He writes about new owners acquiring Marquis in 2003, \\"an editorial team of 70, including 12 researchers, make the call on who's notable and who's not.\\" Marquis calls its selection criteria \\"stringent\\" and claims that biographical data on candidates for listing are reviewed by its editors to confirm that its requirements are met. Their chief executive, Gene M. McGovern, told The New York Times that \\"the fundamental standards here are position and accomplishment\\". Once selected, a biographical draft is sent to biographees for pre-publication checking. In cases where notable individuals decline to submit biographical data, Marquis compiles information itself. Criticism In 2007, referring to the International Biographical Centre, the American Biographical Institute, and Marquis Who's Who, Jan Margosian, consumer information coordinator for the Oregon Department of Justice, lumped all biographical reference volumes together in a \\"warning to consumers\\" to be wary, labeled all such companies \\"pretty tacky\\", and added that \\"I don't know why they would put you in there if they weren't hoping to get you to buy the book. You truly have to look at how they are marketing and what the spin is. It's something you might want to watch out for\\". In 1999, Forbes magazine published \\"The Hall of Lame\\" by Tucker Carlson, in which Carlson reported that the selection process was neither rigorous nor meaningful; self-nominators and thousands of people who are not particularly notable were included; and that Marquis profited by selling subscriber addresses to direct mail marketers. Marquis Who's Who states that it requires no fees from those selected as biographees on its website's 2019 FAQ page, which also states that those listed may have online access, and may edit their own online listings, by using the company's connected \\"Marquis Biographies Online\\" subscription service.\\"Marquis Who's Who Online PRO VERSION 1.2\\", Marquis Who's Who.

Early years  Aris Velouchiotis was born in Lamia, Greece in 1905, to an upper urban class family. His father was Dimitrios Klaras, a well-known lawyer in the area and his mother was Aglaia Zerva. Initially Klaras studied journalism, but later attended and graduated from the Geoponic School of Larissa. He left for Athens, where he did various jobs, participated in the leftist and antimilitary movement and later became a member of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). During the 1920s and 30s he was jailed several times for different offenses. He became an editor in the communist Rizospastis and wrote several articles supporting socialist revolution. In 1931, an article of Klaras caused the intervention of the authorities, who closed the newspaper and proceeded to prosecute the editors. The newspaper was republished as Neos Rizospastis. During the Ioannis Metaxas dictatorship (1936‚Äì1941), there was an \\"unprecedent witch-hunt\\" against Greek communists. Velouchiotis was arrested for his communist ideas at the end of 1936 and jailed in the Aegina prison, where he was tortured under the police interrogation techniques refined by Konstantinos Maniadakis, the Minister of Security. He managed to escape during transport from Aegina to Athens for trial in 1937, but was arrested soon thereafter and sent back Aegina for an additional four years. He remained imprisoned there until signing a \\"statement of renouncement of KKE and of the communist ideology,\\" a very humiliating act for a communist at the time. These statements of renouncement, called \\"declarations of repentance\\", were then distributed to the authorities in the signatory's home village. These confessions were often publicly published listing both the actions for which the signatory had confessed, as well as wholly fabricated confessions, marking the signatories as dilosias (renegades) in their home villages. This left a mark on Velouchiotis' name, both with those supporting the Metaxas dictatorship, but also from the communists, who saw his declaration as a capitulation.  World War II: From Klaras to Aris ELAS Velouchiotis, to the left, with officers of ELAS During World War II, he fought as an artillery private of the Hellenic Army at the Albanian front against the Italian army, until the German invasion in April 1941 and Greece's subsequent surrender and occupation. After Germany's offensive campaign in the Soviet Union, the Greek Communist Party championed the creation of the National Liberation Front (EAM), and Klaras was sent to Central Greece (Greek Roumeli) to assess the potential for the development of a guerrilla movement against the occupation forces in this area. His proposals were adopted by the party, and in January 1942, Klaras moved to the mountains to start setting up guerrilla groups. The first appearance of the partisans organised by Klaras occurred on June 7, 1942, in the village of Domnista in Evrytania in Central Greece. There he presented himself as Major of Artillery (for gaining extra prestige among the villagers) with the nom de guerre of Aris Velouchiotis (from Ares, the Greek god of war, and Velouchi, a local mountain) and proclaimed the existence of the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). Initially, he collected also the traditional local mountain living bandits in order to create a small group of experts in guerrilla fighting. Velouchiotis as a leader applied steely discipline and managed to have under his commands a considerable number of guerillas. Starting with only 15 men, ELAS' power finally comprised up to 50,000 guerillas. One of the most important early operations of the Greek resistance movement (in which Velouchiotis and his fighters, after negotiations with the British, agreed to participate alongside Napoleon Zervas's republican EDES resistance forces and twelve British saboteurs under the leadership of Major E. C. W. \\"Eddie\\" Myers) was the blowing-up of the Gorgopotamos railway viaduct, south of Lamia, on November 25, 1942 (Operation Harling). The destruction of the viaduct cut the single Thessaloniki-Athens rail line, thus the line connecting the Balkans with southern Greece, but did not disrupt any supply lines‚Äîas would have been the case had it happened, as the British intended, two months earlier‚Äîto Erwin Rommel's German forces in Northern Africa, as it took place one month after the commencement of the El Alamein battle on October 23, 1942, in which Rommel was badly defeated by the British. The destruction of the Gorgopotamos viaduct was to be the last operation where the communist-influenced ELAS organisation fought alongside Greek Republican resistance forces, such as the EKKA's 5/42 Evzones Regiment (military arm of EKKA) and EOEA (National Groups of Greek Guerillas, Œïthnikes Omades Ellinon Antarton, military arm of EDES). But despite the signing of an agreement in July 1943 between the three main Resistance groups (EAM/ELAS, EDES and EKKA) to cooperate and to subject themselves to the Allied Middle East High Command under General Wilson (the \\"National Bands Agreement\\"), in the political field, the mutual mistrust between EAM and the other groups escalated. EAM-ELAS was by now the dominant political and military force in Greece, and EDES and EKKA, along with the British and the Greek government-in- exile, feared that after the inevitable German withdrawal, it would try to dominate the country and establish a soviet regime The rift ultimately led to a civil war in late 1943 and early 1944, in which ELAS attacked EDES, EOEA and destroyed EKKA's 5/42 Evzones Regiment, executing its leader Col. Dimitrios Psarros.  Liberation and expulsion from the Communist Party  Velouchiotis talks in Lamia after the withdrawal of the Axis powers. In October 1944, when the Nazis evacuated Greece, ELAS was the dominant force in most of the Greek cities, except Athens, while EAM had established its own government, the PEEA. Velouchiotis passed from Central Greece to Peloponnese to clear the region from the Security Battalions, and fought several battles against them. The British, with units of the Greek Army, were landed in Greece (Operation Manna) and a new government was formed under Georgios Papandreou, the leader of the Greek National Unity Government, which was established following the Treaties of Lebanon and Caserta. Velouchiotis returned to Central Greece and made a speech in his native town, Lamia. During the Dekemvriana events in Athens, he was sent by the Party to Epirus, where he attacked the forces of Zervas' EDES. EDES evacuated the region of Epirus and passed to the Ionian islands. When the Varkiza agreement was signed to end the Dekemvriana fighting between EAM forces and governmental/British forces in Athens, he personally with General Sarafis signed the demobilisation of the ELAS army. But afterwards, he vehemently refused to comply regarding the agreement as a betrayal of the guerillas. The leadership of the Communist Party, under Nikos Zachariadis, consequently accused him of treachery, of being a \\"suspicious and adventurous element\\" and spurned him as a member of KKE.ŒöŒöŒï, ŒµœÄŒØœÉŒ∑ŒºŒ± Œ∫ŒµŒØŒºŒµŒΩŒ±, œÑ8ŒîŒøŒ∫ŒØŒºŒπŒø ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöŒöŒï The Communist Party was always suspicious of Klaras' actions since he was a simple member, and even when he founded ELAS, partly cause of his old renouncement of the party and his fickle character.  Death  Velouchiotis moved again to the mountains of Central Greece in order to start an insurgency (see Greek Civil War) against the new government and the British allies who supported them (considering them worse than Germans). He was reported to have denounced the sell-out to the British in the Varkiza Agreement to lay down the National Resistance arms; particularly moving was the sight of his elite massed Mavroskoufides (Black Berets) openly mourning. He was outmanoeuvred by the KKE leadership and resolved to leave Greece; he repeatedly requested permission from the party to be allowed to depart, but was refused. His intention was to create a new ELAS and a National Independence Front (MEA). Though most of his associates abandoned him, he was reported to have continued to conduct guerrilla activities until June 1945. He was denounced by the KKE Central Committee and increasingly isolated, until he was ambushed with his unit in the mountain of Agrafa (some say that he was set up or even betrayed by KKE contacts) by para-military groups controlled by the Athens government. Aris and his second in command, Giannis Aggeletos (nom de guerre: Leon Tzavellas), were isolated by the main unit and finally he committed suicide with his comrade, either by a hand grenade or by a bullet, on the same day he learned that he was denounced by the communist party. Rumors want him to \\"have committed suicide with his commander Tzavellas when his thoughts were that there is no better future for his revolution\\".For a complete presentation of the circumstances of Velouchiotis' death see: ŒßŒ±œÅŒπœÑœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, ŒîŒπŒøŒΩœçœÉŒ∑œÇ (Charitopoulos, Dionysis) (2003).

Charitopoulos takes for granted that Velouchiotis committed a \\"heroic\\" suicide. The heads of Velouchiotis (right) and Tzavellas, exposed in the central square of the town of Trikala. The corpses of Velouchiotis and Tzavellas were subsequently decapitated, and the heads displayed (a practice of the pre-war Greek State and Police for the common mountain bandits), hanging from a lamp post in the central square of the town of Trikala. When British Labour government members of Parliament objected to the barbarity of the operation, they received the reply that the display was in accordance to an \\"ancient Greek war custom\\". Following the rehabilitation in Greece of the EAM/ELAS and subsequently of the Communist party itself (after the end of the Greek military junta), busts and statues of Aris Velouchiotis have been erected in his native town; recently the KKE moved discreetly for Velouchiotis' rehabilitation, following in turn the expulsion of the KKE's wartime leader (who had denounced him), Nikos Zachariadis.  Relationship with Zervas  Coincidentally, the two leaders of the Greek Resistance were distant cousins. Zervas was descendant from the famous Souliote clan of Zervades, who after the destruction of Souli by the Ottomans fled to Aitoloakarnania, while Klaras' mother was of Souliote descent, from a family related to Zervades. However, Zervas had never before seen Velouchiotis before their first meeting during the Resistance era.  Legacy  Velouchiotis is one of the most controversial figures of modern Greek history. His personality and action was mythologised during his life and after his death. Supporters consider him a symbol of Greek resistance against the occupying powers, the founder and creator of the biggest guerrilla army in the Greek history (ELAS) and a hero of the communist cause. Critics see him as a perpetrator of atrocities and murders against rural people who were perceived as opponents of communism; a basic instigator of the Red Terror.C.M. Woodhouse, \\"The Struggle for Greece, 1941-1949\\", , pp. 4-5. In his memories he appreciates his military abilities. However, he was a man of strong patriotic beliefs. He was especially strict to Greeks who sought collaboration with the occupying forces, with his companions who broke the organized discipline, and people who approved the involvement of the British in Greek politics since he considered the British a threat to the patriotic cause of the Resistance.

Carl Per Gunnar Gahrton (born 2 February 1943 in Malm√∂) is a Swedish politician. He was a Member of Parliament, holding a seat for the Liberal Party from 1976 to 1979, and for the Green Party from 1988 to 1991, and again in 1994-95. Later, he was a Member of the European Parliament from 1995 to 2004. Early in his career, Gahrton was elected chairman of the youth and student wing of the Swedish Liberal Party, in 1969. In 1971 he was challenged for the post by Lars Leijonborg due to ideological tensions; Leijonborg succeeded him after a narrow win. Gahrton entered in 1976 as a Member of Parliament for the Liberal Party. He was re-elected in 1979 but left the parliament and the party the same year, expressing disenchantment with the parliament bureaucracy. Turning to the nascent Green Party, in the 1980s he was one of its founders in 1981 and one of its more high-profile men for many years, one of relatively few in the new party who had several years of prior experience of professional politics before joining; he served as one of two spokespersons for the party from 1984 to 1985. He also served as a Member of Parliament for the Green Party from 1988 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1995. From 1995 to 2004 he was a Member of the European Parliament. He is an outspoken eurosceptic and was one of the leading proponents of the \\"no\\"-side in the 1994 Swedish European Union membership referendum (which was won by the \\"yes\\"-side). Gahrton currently serves as Presidentof the Swedish Association for Solidarity with Palestine. In December 2008, Gahrton sharply criticized the a European Union proposal ‚ÄùGuidelines for strengthening the political dialogue structures with Israel‚Äù arguing that the guidelines in fact were meant to establish \\"a Security Pact with Israel.\\" He also argued that due to \\"the well-known Israeli skill in lobbying and in influencing opinions worldwide, it is no exaggeration to argue that from now on and for all practical purposes the Middle East Policy of the EU will be elaborated, even co-written, by Israel.\\" Israel will now be co-writing the European Union's Middle East policies , Per Gahrton, The Transnational Foundation (TFF), December 15, 2008. In March 2009, Gahrton participated in a large protest against the Davis Cup match between Sweden and Israel in Malmo. Under orders from local politicians, the match was played behind closed doors. Gahrton claimed that this decision had already given demonstrators some success, stating that \\"We have been helped by brave politicians in Malm√∂. We thank them for that.\\"6,000 join Malm√∂ Davis Cup protest, The Local (Sweden's News in English), March 7. 2009. Gahrton is the author of \\"Life and Death in the European Parliament\\", part political thriller, part tell-all memoir. The book was criticized by fellow parliament members as being a thinly disguised rip- off of Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", which dominated Sweden's best seller lists at the time, and Gahrton accused of wanting to cash in on Brown's success. Consequently, Gahrton was forced to distribute the book free of charge. Gahrton has described himself as Jewish according to the traditional Jewish definition, as his matrilineal family, viz. his maternal grandmother's mother, was Jewish.Per Gahrton, Palestinas frihetskamp : historia, analys och personliga iakttagelser, Carlsson, 2008, p. 67, Books *Life and Death in the European Parliament.

Constenla alleges that she was told by Che's mother, Celia de la Serna, that she was already pregnant when she and Ernesto Guevara Lynch were married and that the date on the birth certificate of their son was forged to make it appear that he was born a month later than the actual date to avoid scandal. (Anderson 1997, pp. 3, 769.) ‚Äì 9 October 1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.Casey 2009, p. 128. As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed.On Revolutionary Medicine Speech by Che Guevara to the Cuban Militia on 19 August 1960. \\"Because of the circumstances in which I traveled, first as a student and later as a doctor, I came into close contact with poverty, hunger and disease; with the inability to treat a child because of lack of money; with the stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment, to the point that a father can accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident, as occurs often in the downtrodden classes of our American homeland. And I began to realize at that time that there were things that were almost as important to me as becoming famous or making a significant contribution to medical science: I wanted to help those people.\\"Anderson 1997, pp. 90-91. His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo √Årbenz, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidified Guevara's political ideology. Later in Mexico City, Guevara met Ra√∫l and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.Beaubien, NPR Audio Report, 2009, 00:09‚Äì00:13. Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second in command and played a pivotal role in the victorious two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.\\"Castro's Brain\\", 1960. Following the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals,Taibo 1999, p. 267. instituting agrarian land reform as minister of industries, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba's armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion,Kellner 1989, pp. 69‚Äì70. and bringing Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to Cuba, which preceded the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.Anderson 1997, pp. 526‚Äì530. Additionally, Guevara was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal guerrilla warfare manual, along with a best-selling memoir about his youthful continental motorcycle journey. His experiences and studying of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism led him to posit that the Third World's underdevelopment and dependence was an intrinsic result of imperialism, neocolonialism and monopoly capitalism, with the only remedy being proletarian internationalism and world revolution.\\"On Development\\" Speech delivered by Che Guevara at the plenary session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva, Switzerland on 25 March 1964. \\"The inflow of capital from the developed countries is the prerequisite for the establishment of economic dependence. This inflow takes various forms: loans granted on onerous terms; investments that place a given country in the power of the investors; almost total technological subordination of the dependent country to the developed country; control of a country's foreign trade by the big international monopolies; and in extreme cases, the use of force as an economic weapon in support of the other forms of exploitation.\\"At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria A speech by Che Guevara to the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria on 24 February 1965.\\"The struggle against imperialism, for liberation from colonial or neocolonial shackles, which is being carried out by means of political weapons, arms, or a combination of the two, is not separate from the struggle against backwardness and poverty. Both are stages on the same road leading toward the creation of a new society of justice and plenty. ... Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries. To raise the living standards of the underdeveloped nations, therefore, we must fight against imperialism. ... The practice of proletarian internationalism is not only a duty for the peoples struggling for a better future, it is also an inescapable necessity.\\" Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad, first unsuccessfully in Congo- Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.Ryan 1998, p. 4. Guevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies, memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. As a result of his perceived martyrdom, poetic invocations for class struggle, and desire to create the consciousness of a \\"new man\\" driven by moral rather than material incentives,Footnote for Socialism and man in Cuba (1965): \\"Che argued that the full liberation of humankind is reached when work becomes a social duty carried out with complete satisfaction and sustained by a value system that contributes to the realization of conscious action in performing tasks. This could only be achieved by systematic education, acquired by passing through various stages in which collective action is increased. Che recognized that this to be difficult and time-consuming. In his desire to speed up this process, however, he developed methods of mobilizing people, bringing together their collective and individual interests. Among the most significant of these instruments were moral and material incentives, while deepening consciousness as a way of developing toward socialism. See Che's speeches: Homage to Emulation Prize Winners (1962) and A New Attitude to Work (1964).\\" Guevara has evolved into a quintessential icon of various leftist movements. In contrast, his ideological critics on the right accuse him of authoritarianism and sanctifying violence against his political opponents. Despite disagreements on his legacy, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century,Dorfman 1999. while an Alberto Korda photograph of him, titled Guerrillero Heroico, was cited by the Maryland Institute College of Art as \\"the most famous photograph in the world\\".Maryland Institute of Art, referenced at BBC News 26 May 2001. Early life A teenage Ernesto (left) with his parents and siblings, c. 1944, seated beside him from left to right: Celia (mother), Celia (sister), Roberto, Juan Mart√≠n, Ernesto (father) and Ana Mar√≠a Ernesto Guevara was born to Ernesto Guevara Lynch and Celia de la Serna y Llosa, on 14 June 1928, in Rosario, Argentina. He was the eldest of five children in a middle-class Argentine family of Spanish (including Basque and Cantabrian) descent, as well as Irish by means of his patrilineal ancestor Patrick Lynch.Che's last name Guevara derives from the Castilianized form of the Basque Gebara, a habitational name from the province of √Ålava, while his grandmother, Ana Lynch, was a descendant of Patrick Lynch, who emigrated from County Galway, Ireland in the 1740s.Guevara Lynch 2007, pp. i. \\"The father of Che Guevara, Ernesto Guevara Lynch was born in Argentina in 1900 of Irish and Basque origin.\\"The Origins of Guevara's Name - written in Spanish Although Guevara's legal name on his birth certificate was \\"Ernesto Guevara\\", his name sometimes appears with \\"de la Serna\\" and/or \\"Lynch\\" accompanying it.In Spanish a person may carry the surname of his or her father as well as that of his or her mother, albeit in that order. Some people carry both, others only that of their father. In Guevara's case, many people of Irish descent will add \\"Lynch\\" to emphasize his Irish relations. Others will add \\"de la Serna\\" to give respect to Guevara's mother. Referring to Che's \\"restless\\" nature, his father declared \\"the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels\\".Lavretsky 1976. Very early on in life, Ernestito (as he was then called) developed an \\"affinity for the poor\\".Kellner 1989, p. 23. Growing up in a family with leftist leanings, Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy.Argentina: Che's Red Mother Time Magazine, 14 July 1961. His father, a staunch supporter of Republicans from the Spanish Civil War, often hosted many veterans from the conflict in the Guevara home.Anderson 1997, pp. 22‚Äì23. Despite suffering crippling bouts of acute asthma that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete, enjoying swimming, football, golf, and shooting, while also becoming an \\"untiring\\" cyclist.Sandison 1996, p. 8.Kellner 1989, p. 24. He was an avid rugby union player,Argentine Rugby Inspired by Che Guevara by Brendan Gallagher, The Daily Telegraph, 5 October 2007 and played at fly-half for Club Universitario de Buenos Aires.Cain, Nick & Growden, Greg. \\"Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby\\" in Rugby Union for Dummies (2nd Edition), John Wiley and Sons; , p. 293. His rugby playing earned him the nickname \\"Fuser\\"‚Äîa contraction of El Furibundo (raging) and his mother's surname, de la Serna‚Äîfor his aggressive style of play.Anderson 1997, p. 28. =Intellectual and literary interests= 22-year-old Guevara in 1951 Guevara learned chess from his father, and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12. During adolescence and throughout his life he was passionate about poetry, especially that of Pablo Neruda, John Keats, Antonio Machado, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Gabriela Mistral, C√©sar Vallejo, and Walt Whitman.Hart 2004, p. 98. He could also recite Rudyard Kipling's \\"If‚Äî\\" and Jos√© Hern√°ndez's Mart√≠n Fierro by heart. The Guevara home contained more than 3,000 books, which allowed Guevara to be an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests including Karl Marx, William Faulkner, Andr√© Gide, Emilio Salgari and Jules Verne.Haney 2005, p. 164. Additionally, he enjoyed the works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Vladimir Lenin and Jean-Paul Sartre; as well as Anatole France, Friedrich Engels, H. G. Wells and Robert Frost.(Anderson 1997, pp. 37‚Äì38). As he grew older, he developed an interest in the Latin American writers Horacio Quiroga, Ciro Alegr√≠a, Jorge Icaza, Rub√©n Dar√≠o and Miguel Asturias. Many of these authors' ideas he cataloged in his own handwritten notebooks of concepts, definitions, and philosophies of influential intellectuals. These included composing analytical sketches of Buddha and Aristotle, along with examining Bertrand Russell on love and patriotism, Jack London on society and Nietzsche on the idea of death. Sigmund Freud's ideas fascinated him as he quoted him on a variety of topics from dreams and libido to narcissism and the Oedipus complex. His favorite subjects in school included philosophy, mathematics, engineering, political science, sociology, history and archaeology.Sandison 1996, p. 10.Kellner 1989, p. 26. Years later, a declassified CIA 'biographical and personality report' dated 13 February 1958 made note of Guevara's wide range of academic interests and intellect, describing him as \\"quite well read\\" while adding that \\"Che is fairly intellectual for a Latino.\\"Ratner 1997, p. 25. =Motorcycle journey= Guevara (right) with Alberto Granado (left) in June 1952 on the Amazon River aboard their \\"Mambo-Tango\\" wooden raft, which was a gift from the lepers whom they had treatedAnderson 1997, p. 89. In 1948, Guevara entered the University of Buenos Aires to study medicine. His \\"hunger to explore the world\\"Anderson 1997, p. 64. led him to intersperse his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that fundamentally changed the way he viewed himself and the contemporary economic conditions in Latin America. The first expedition in 1950 was a 4,500-kilometer (2,800 mi) solo trip through the rural provinces of northern Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine.Anderson 1997, p. 59‚Äì64. This was followed in 1951 by a nine-month, 8,000-kilometer (5,000 mi) continental motorcycle trek through part of South America. For the latter, he took a year off from his studies to embark with his friend Alberto Granado, with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo leper colony in Peru, on the banks of the Amazon River.Anderson 1997, pp. 83. A map of Guevara's 1952 trip with Alberto Granado (the red arrows correspond to air travel) In Chile, Guevara found himself enraged by the working conditions of the miners in Anaconda's Chuquicamata copper mine and moved by his overnight encounter in the Atacama Desert with a persecuted communist couple who did not even own a blanket, describing them as \\"the shivering flesh-and-blood victims of capitalist exploitation\\".Anderson 1997, pp. 75‚Äì76. Additionally, on the way to Machu Picchu high in the Andes, he was struck by the crushing poverty of the remote rural areas, where peasant farmers worked small plots of land owned by wealthy landlords.Kellner 1989, p. 27. Later on his journey, Guevara was especially impressed by the camaraderie among those living in a leper colony, stating, \\"The highest forms of human solidarity and loyalty arise among such lonely and desperate people.\\" Guevara used notes taken during this trip to write an account, titled The Motorcycle Diaries, which later became a New York Times best-seller,NYT bestseller list: #38 Paperback Nonfiction on 2005-02-20, #9 Nonfiction on 2004-10-07 and on more occasions. and was adapted into a 2004 award-winning film of the same name. The journey took Guevara through Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and Miami, Florida, for 20 days,Che Guevara spent time in Miami by Alfonso Chardy, The Miami Herald 8 July 2008 before returning home to Buenos Aires. By the end of the trip, he came to view Latin America not as a collection of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united Hispanic America sharing a common Latino heritage was a theme that recurred prominently during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his studies and received his medical degree in June 1953, making him officially \\"Dr. Ernesto Guevara\\".Anderson 1997, p. 98.A copy of Guevara's University transcripts showing conferral of his medical diploma can be found on p. 75 of Becoming Che: Guevara's Second and Final Trip through Latin America, by Carlos 'Calica' Ferrer (Translated from the Spanish by Sarah L. Smith), Marea Editorial, 2006, . Ferrer was a longtime childhood friend of Che, and when Guevara passed the last of his 12 exams in 1953, he gave him a copy to prove to Ferrer, who had been telling Guevara that he would never finish, that he had finally completed his studies. Guevara later remarked that through his travels in Latin America, he came in \\"close contact with poverty, hunger and disease\\" along with the \\"inability to treat a child because of lack of money\\" and \\"stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment\\" that leads a father to \\"accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident\\". Guevara cited these experiences as convincing him that in order to \\"help these people\\", he needed to leave the realm of medicine and consider the political arena of armed struggle. Guatemala, √Årbenz, and United Fruit On 7 July 1953, Guevara set out again, this time to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. On 10 December 1953, before leaving for Guatemala, Guevara sent an update to his Aunt Beatriz from San Jos√©, Costa Rica. In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing the dominion of the United Fruit Company, a journey which convinced him that the Company's capitalist system was a terrible one.Anderson 1997, p. 126. This affirmed indignation carried the more aggressive tone he adopted in order to frighten his more Conservative relatives, and ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then recently deceased Joseph Stalin, not to rest until these \\"octopuses have been vanquished\\".Taibo 1999, p. 31. Later that month, Guevara arrived in Guatemala where President Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n headed a democratically elected government that, through land reform and other initiatives, was attempting to end the latifundia system. To accomplish this, President √Årbenz had enacted a major land reform program, where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants. The biggest land owner, and one most affected by the reforms, was the United Fruit Company, from which the √Årbenz government had already taken more than of uncultivated land.Kellner 1989, p. 31. Pleased with the road the nation was heading down, Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to \\"perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary.\\"Guevara Lynch 2000, p. 26. Granma In Guatemala City, Guevara sought out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was well-connected politically as a member of the left-leaning Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA, American Popular Revolutionary Alliance). She introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the Arbenz government. Guevara then established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to Fidel Castro through the 26 July 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba. During this period, he acquired his famous nickname, due to his frequent use of the Argentine filler syllable che (a multi-purpose discourse marker, like the syllable \\"eh\\" in Canadian English).Ignacio 2007, p. 172. During his time in Guatemala, Guevara was helped by other Central American exiles, one of whom, Helena Leiva de Holst, provided him with food and lodging, discussed her travels to study Marxism in Russia and China,\\"Anderson (2010)\\", p 126 and to whom, Guevara dedicated a poem, \\"Invitaci√≥n al camino\\". In May 1954, a shipment of infantry and light artillery weapons was dispatched from Communist Czechoslovakia for the Arbenz Government and arrived in Puerto Barrios. As a result, the United States government‚Äîwhich since 1953 had been tasked by President Eisenhower to remove Arbenz from power in the multifaceted CIA operation code-named PBSuccess‚Äîresponded by saturating Guatemala with anti- Arbenz propaganda through radio and dropped leaflets, and began bombing raids using unmarked airplanes. The United States also sponsored a force of several hundred Guatemalan refugees and mercenaries who were headed by Castillo Armas to help remove the Arbenz government. On 27 June, Arbenz decided to resign. This allowed Armas and his CIA-assisted forces to march into Guatemala City and establish a military junta, which elected Armas as President on 7 July. Consequently, the Armas regime then consolidated power by rounding up and executing suspected communists, while crushing the previously flourishing labor unions and reversing the previous agrarian reforms. Guevara himself was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed militia organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose, but frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. Guevara's repeated calls to resist were noted by supporters of the coup, and he was marked for murder.Kellner 1989, p. 32. After Hilda Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine consulate, where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to Mexico.Taibo 1999, p. 39. The overthrow of the Arbenz regime and establishment of the right-wing Armas dictatorship cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an imperialist power that opposed and attempted to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. In speaking about the coup, Guevara stated: Guevara's conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions was thus strengthened.Che Guevara 1960‚Äì67 by Frank E. Smitha. Gadea wrote later, \\"It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism. By the time he left, he was sure of this.\\" Mexico City and preparation Guevara with Hilda Gadea at Chich√©n Itz√° on their honeymoon trip Guevara arrived in Mexico City on 21 September 1954, and worked in the allergy section of the General Hospital and at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico. In addition he gave lectures on medicine at the Faculty of Medicine in the National Autonomous University of Mexico and worked as a news photographer for Latina News Agency.Kellner 1989, p. 33. His first wife Hilda notes in her memoir My Life with Che, that for a while, Guevara considered going to work as a doctor in Africa and that he continued to be deeply troubled by the poverty around him.Rebel Wife, A Review of My Life With Che: The Making of a Revolutionary by Hilda Gadea by Tom Gjelten, The Washington Post, 12 October 2008. In one instance, Hilda describes Guevara's obsession with an elderly washerwoman whom he was treating, remarking that he saw her as \\"representative of the most forgotten and exploited class\\". Hilda later found a poem that Che had dedicated to the old woman, containing \\"a promise to fight for a better world, for a better life for all the poor and exploited\\". During this time he renewed his friendship with √ëico L√≥pez and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala. In June 1955, L√≥pez introduced him to Ra√∫l Castro, who subsequently introduced him to his older brother, Fidel Castro, the revolutionary leader who had formed the 26th of July Movement and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. During a long conversation with Fidel on the night of their first meeting, Guevara concluded that the Cuban's cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of the July 26 Movement.Taibo 1999, p. 55. Despite their \\"contrasting personalities\\", from this point on Che and Fidel began to foster what dual biographer Simon Reid-Henry deemed a \\"revolutionary friendship that would change the world\\", as a result of their coinciding commitment to anti- imperialism.Fidel and Che: A Revolutionary Friendship by Simon Reid-Henry audio slideshow by The Guardian, 9 January 2009 By this point in Guevara's life, he deemed that U.S.-controlled conglomerates installed and supported repressive regimes around the world. In this vein, he considered Batista a \\"U.S. puppet whose strings needed cutting\\".Sandison 1996, p. 28. Although he planned to be the group's combat medic, Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement. The key portion of training involved learning hit and run tactics of guerrilla warfare. Guevara and the others underwent arduous 15-hour marches over mountains, across rivers, and through the dense undergrowth, learning and perfecting the procedures of ambush and quick retreat. From the start Guevara was Alberto Bayo's \\"prize student\\" among those in training, scoring the highest on all of the tests given.Kellner 1989, p. 37. At the end of the course, he was called \\"the best guerrilla of them all\\" by their instructor, General Bayo.Anderson 1997, p. 194. Guevara then married Gadea in Mexico in September 1955, before embarking on his plan to assist in the liberation of Cuba.Snow, Anita. \\"'My Life With Che' by Hilda Gadea \\". Associated Press at WJXX-TV. 16 August 2008; retrieved 23 February 2009. Cuban Revolution =Invasion, warfare, and Santa Clara= The first step in Castro's revolutionary plan was an assault on Cuba from Mexico via the Granma, an old, leaky cabin cruiser. They set out for Cuba on 25 November 1956. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture; only 22 found each other afterwards.Anderson 1997, p. 213. During this initial bloody confrontation Guevara laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, proving to be a symbolic moment in Che's life.Anderson 1997, p. 211. Las Villas province, Cuba, November 1958 Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where they received support from the urban guerrilla network of Frank Pa√≠s, 26 July Movement, and local campesinos. With the group withdrawn to the Sierra, the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when the interview by Herbert Matthews appeared in The New York Times. The article presented a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas. Guevara was not present for the interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale diminished, and with an allergy to mosquito bites which resulted in agonizing walnut-sized cysts on his body,Sandison 1996, p. 32. Guevara considered these \\"the most painful days of the war\\".DePalma 2006, pp. 110‚Äì11. During Guevara's time living hidden among the poor subsistence farmers of the Sierra Maestra mountains, he discovered that there were no schools, no electricity, minimal access to healthcare, and more than 40 percent of the adults were illiterate. As the war continued, Guevara became an integral part of the rebel army and \\"convinced Castro with competence, diplomacy and patience\\". Guevara set up factories to make grenades, built ovens to bake bread, and organized schools to teach illiterate campesinos to read and write. Moreover, Guevara established health clinics, workshops to teach military tactics, and a newspaper to disseminate information.Kellner 1989, p. 45. The man whom Time dubbed three years later \\"Castro's brain\\" at this point was promoted by Fidel Castro to Comandante (commander) of a second army column. As second in command, Guevara was a harsh disciplinarian who sometimes shot defectors. Deserters were punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send squads to track those seeking to go AWOL.Anderson 1997, pp. 269‚Äì270. As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness.Casta√±eda 1998, pp. 105, 119. During the guerrilla campaign, Guevara was also responsible for the summary executions of a number of men accused of being informers, deserters or spies.Anderson 1997, pp. 237‚Äì238, 269‚Äì270, 277‚Äì278. In his diaries, Guevara described the first such execution of Eut√≠mio Guerra, a peasant army guide who admitted treason when it was discovered he accepted the promise of ten thousand pesos for repeatedly giving away the rebel's position for attack by the Cuban air force.Luther 2001, pp. 97‚Äì99. Such information also allowed Batista's army to burn the homes of peasants sympathetic to the revolution. Upon Guerra's request that they \\"end his life quickly\\", Che stepped forward and shot him in the head, writing \\"The situation was uncomfortable for the people and for Eutimio so I ended the problem giving him a shot with a .32 pistol in the right side of the brain, with exit orifice in the right temporal [lobe].\\"Anderson 1997, p. 237. His scientific notations and matter-of-fact description, suggested to one biographer a \\"remarkable detachment to violence\\" by that point in the war. Later, Guevara published a literary account of the incident, titled \\"Death of a Traitor\\", where he transfigured Eutimio's betrayal and pre-execution request that the revolution \\"take care of his children\\", into a \\"revolutionary parable about redemption through sacrifice\\". Smoking a pipe at his guerrilla base in the Escambray Mountains Although he maintained a demanding and harsh disposition, Guevara also viewed his role of commander as one of a teacher, entertaining his men during breaks between engagements with readings from the likes of Robert Louis Stevenson, Miguel de Cervantes, and Spanish lyric poets.Sandison 1996, p. 35. Together with this role, and inspired by Jos√© Mart√≠'s principle of \\"literacy without borders\\", Guevara further ensured that his rebel fighters made daily time to teach the uneducated campesinos with whom they lived and fought to read and write, in what Guevara termed the \\"battle against ignorance\\". Tom√°s Alba, who fought under Guevara's command, later stated that \\"Che was loved, in spite of being stern and demanding. We would (have) given our life for him.\\"Cuba Remembers Che Guevara 40 Years after his Fall by Rosa Tania Valdes, Reuters, 8 October 2007 His commanding officer Fidel Castro described Guevara as intelligent, daring, and an exemplary leader who \\"had great moral authority over his troops\\".Ignacio 2007, p. 177. Castro further remarked that Guevara took too many risks, even having a \\"tendency toward foolhardiness\\".Ignacio 2007, p. 193. Guevara's teenage lieutenant, Joel Iglesias, recounts such actions in his diary, noting that Guevara's behavior in combat even brought admiration from the enemy. On one occasion Iglesias recounts the time he had been wounded in battle, stating \\"Che ran out to me, defying the bullets, threw me over his shoulder, and got me out of there. The guards didn't dare fire at him ... later they told me he made a great impression on them when they saw him run out with his pistol stuck in his belt, ignoring the danger, they didn't dare shoot.\\"Poster Boy of The Revolution by Saul Landau, The Washington Post, 19 October 1997, p. X01. Guevara was instrumental in creating the clandestine radio station Radio Rebelde (Rebel Radio) in February 1958, which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by 26 July movement, and provided radiotelephone communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of CIA supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n. To quell the rebellion, Cuban government troops began executing rebel prisoners on the spot, and regularly rounded up, tortured, and shot civilians as a tactic of intimidation.Kellner 1989, p. 42. By March 1958, the continued atrocities carried out by Batista's forces led the United States to stop selling arms to the Cuban government. Then in late July 1958, Guevara played a critical role in the Battle of Las Mercedes by using his column to halt a force of 1,500 men called up by Batista's General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro's forces. Years later, Major Larry Bockman of the United States Marine Corps analyzed and described Che's tactical appreciation of this battle as \\"brilliant\\".Bockman 1984. During this time Guevara also became an \\"expert\\" at leading hit-and-run tactics against Batista's army, and then fading back into the countryside before the army could counterattack.Kellner 1989, p. 40. After the Battle of Santa Clara, 1 January 1959 As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards Havana. Travelling by foot, Guevara embarked on a difficult 7-week march, only travelling at night to avoid an ambush and often not eating for several days.Kellner 1989, p. 47. In the closing days of December 1958, Guevara's task was to cut the island in half by taking Las Villas province. In a matter of days he executed a series of \\"brilliant tactical victories\\" that gave him control of all but the province's capital city of Santa Clara. Guevara then directed his \\"suicide squad\\" in the attack on Santa Clara, which became the final decisive military victory of the revolution.Castro 1972, pp. 439‚Äì442.Dorschner 1980, pp. 41‚Äì47, 81‚Äì87. In the six weeks leading up to the battle, there were times when his men were completely surrounded, outgunned, and overrun. Che's eventual victory despite being outnumbered 10:1 remains in the view of some observers a \\"remarkable tour de force in modern warfare\\".Sandison 1996, p. 39. Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara's column had taken Santa Clara on New Year's Eve 1958. This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media, which had at one stage reported Guevara's death during the fighting. At 3 am on 1 January 1959, upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with Guevara, Fulgencio Batista boarded a plane in Havana and fled for the Dominican Republic, along with an amassed \\"fortune of more than $300,000,000 through graft and payoffs\\".Kellner 1989, p. 48. The following day on 2 January, Guevara entered Havana to take final control of the capital.Kellner 1989, p. 13. Fidel Castro took six more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on 8 January 1959. The final death toll from the two years of revolutionary fighting was 2,000 people.Kellner 1989, p. 51. In mid- January 1959, Guevara went to live at a summer villa in Tarar√° to recover from a violent asthma attack.Casta√±eda, pp. 145‚Äì146. While there he started the Tarara Group, a group that debated and formed the new plans for Cuba's social, political, and economic development.Casta√±eda, p. 146. In addition, Che began to write his book Guerrilla Warfare while resting at Tarara. In February, the revolutionary government proclaimed Guevara \\"a Cuban citizen by birth\\" in recognition of his role in the triumph.Anderson 1997, 397. When Hilda Gadea arrived in Cuba in late January, Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman, and the two agreed on a divorce,Anderson 1997, pp. 400‚Äì401. which was finalized on 22 May.Anderson 1997, p. 424. On 2 June 1959, he married Aleida March, a Cuban-born member of 26 July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958. Guevara returned to the seaside village of Tarara in June for his honeymoon with Aleida.Casta√±eda, p. 159. In total, Guevara had five children from his two marriages.(Casta√±eda 1998, pp. 264‚Äì265). =La Caba√±a, land reform, and literacy= (Right to left) rebel leader Camilo Cienfuegos, Cuban President Manuel Urrutia, and Guevara (January 1959) The first major political crisis arose over what to do with the captured Batista officials who had perpetrated the worst of the repression.Skidmore 2008, pp. 273. During the rebellion against Batista's dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, introduced into the territories under its control the 19th-century penal law commonly known as the Ley de la Sierra (Law of the Sierra).G√≥mez Treto 1991, p. 115. \\"The Penal Law of the War of Independence (July 28, 1896) was reinforced by Rule 1 of the Penal Regulations of the Rebel Army, approved in the Sierra Maestra February 21, 1958, and published in the army's official bulletin (Ley penal de Cuba en armas, 1959)\\" (G√≥mez Treto 1991, p. 123). This law included the death penalty for serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the Batista regime or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959 the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals, captured and tried after the revolution. According to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, this latter extension was supported by the majority of the population, and followed the same procedure as those in the Nuremberg trials held by the Allies after World War II.G√≥mez Treto 1991, pp. 115‚Äì116. Guevara in his trademark olive-green military fatigues and beret To implement a portion of this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the La Caba√±a Fortress prison, for a five-month tenure (2 January through 12 June 1959).Anderson 1997, pp. 372, 425. Guevara was charged by the new government with purging the Batista army and consolidating victory by exacting \\"revolutionary justice\\" against those regarded as traitors, chivatos (informants) or war criminals.Anderson 1997, p. 376. As commander of La Caba√±a, Guevara reviewed the appeals of those convicted during the revolutionary tribunal process. The tribunals were conducted by 2‚Äì3 army officers, an assessor, and a respected local citizen.Kellner 1989, p. 52. On some occasions the penalty delivered by the tribunal was death by firing-squad.Niess 2007, p. 60. Ra√∫l G√≥mez Treto, senior legal advisor to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, has argued that the death penalty was justified in order to prevent citizens themselves from taking justice into their own hands, as had happened twenty years earlier in the anti-Machado rebellion.G√≥mez Treto 1991, p. 116. Biographers note that in January 1959 the Cuban public was in a \\"lynching mood\\",Anderson 1997, p. 388. and point to a survey at the time showing 93% public approval for the tribunal process. Moreover, a 22 January 1959, Universal Newsreel broadcast in the United States and narrated by Ed Herlihy featured Fidel Castro asking an estimated one million Cubans whether they approved of the executions, and being met with a roaring \\"¬°Si!\\" (yes).Rally For Castro: One Million Roar \\"Si\\" To Cuba Executions ‚Äì Video Clip by Universal-International News, narrated by Ed Herlihy, from 22 January 1959 With as many as 20,000 Cubans estimated to have been killed at the hands of Batista's collaborators,Conflict, Order, and Peace in the Americas, by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, 1978, p. 121. \\"The US-supported Batista regime killed 20,000 Cubans\\"The World Guide 1997/98: A View from the South, by University of Texas, 1997, , pg 209. \\"Batista engineered yet another coup, establishing a dictatorial regime, which was responsible for the death of 20,000 Cubans.\\"Fidel: The Untold Story.

Viewable clip. \\"An estimated 20,000 people were murdered by government forces during the Batista dictatorship.\\"Niess 2007, p. 61. and many of the accused war criminals sentenced to death accused of torture and physical atrocities, the newly- empowered government carried out executions, punctuated by cries from the crowds of \\"¬°al pared√≥n!\\" ([to the] wall!), which biographer Jorge Casta√±eda describes as \\"without respect for due process\\". Although accounts vary, it is estimated that several hundred people were executed nationwide during this time, with Guevara's jurisdictional death total at La Caba√±a ranging from 55 to 105.Different sources cite differing numbers of executions attributable to Guevara, with some of the discrepancy resulting from the question of which deaths to attribute directly to Guevara and which to the regime as a whole. Anderson (1997) gives the number specifically at La Caba√±a prison as 55 (p. 387.), while also stating that \\"several hundred people were officially tried and executed across Cuba\\" as a whole (p. 387). (Casta√±eda 1998) notes that historians differ on the total number killed, with different studies placing it as anywhere from 200 to 700 nationwide (p. 143), although he notes that \\"after a certain date most of the executions occurred outside of Che's jurisdiction\\" (p. 143). These numbers are supported by the opposition-based Free Society Project / Cuba Archive, which gives the figure as 144 executions ordered by Guevara across Cuba in three years (1957‚Äì1959) and 105 \\"victims\\" specifically at La Caba√±a, which according to them were all \\"carried out without due process of law\\". Of further note, much of the discrepancy in the estimates between 55 versus 105 executed at La Caba√±a revolves around whether to include instances where Guevara had denied an appeal and signed off on a death warrant, but where the sentence was carried out while he traveled overseas from 4 June to 8 September, or after he relinquished his command of the fortress on 12 June 1959. Conflicting views exist of Guevara's attitude towards the executions at La Caba√±a. Some exiled opposition biographers report that he relished the rituals of the firing squad, and organized them with gusto, while others relate that Guevara pardoned as many prisoners as he could.Casta√±eda 1998, pp. 143‚Äì144. All sides acknowledge that Guevara had become a \\"hardened\\" man who had no qualms about the death penalty or about summary and collective trials. If the only way to \\"defend the revolution was to execute its enemies, he would not be swayed by humanitarian or political arguments\\". In a 5 February 1959, letter to Luis Paredes L√≥pez in Buenos Aires Guevara states unequivocally: \\"The executions by firing squads are not only a necessity for the people of Cuba, but also an imposition of the people.\\"Anderson 1997, p. 375. Along with ensuring \\"revolutionary justice\\", the other key early platform of Guevara was establishing agrarian land reform. Almost immediately after the success of the revolution, on 27 January 1959, Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about \\"the social ideas of the rebel army\\". During this speech he declared that the main concern of the new Cuban government was \\"the social justice that land redistribution brings about\\".Kellner 1989, p. 54. A few months later, 17 May 1959, the Agrarian Reform Law, crafted by Guevara, went into effect, limiting the size of all farms to . Any holdings over these limits were expropriated by the government and either redistributed to peasants in parcels or held as state-run communes.Kellner 1989, p. 57. The law also stipulated that foreigners could not own Cuban sugar-plantations. Tito during a visit to Yugoslavia Guevara visiting the Gaza Strip in 1959 On 12 June 1959, Castro sent Guevara out on a three-month tour of 14 mostly Bandung Pact countries (Morocco, Sudan, Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Yugoslavia, Greece) and the cities of Singapore and Hong Kong.Taibo 1999, pp. 282‚Äì285. Sending Guevara away from Havana allowed Castro to appear to distance himself from Guevara and his Marxist sympathies, which troubled both the United States and some of the members of Castro's 26 July Movement.Anderson 1997, p. 423. While in Jakarta, Guevara visited Indonesian president Sukarno to discuss the recent revolution of 1945-1949 in Indonesia and to establish trade relations between their two countries. The two men quickly bonded, as Sukarno was attracted to Guevara's energy and his relaxed informal approach; moreover they shared revolutionary leftist aspirations against western imperialism. Guevara next spent 12 days in Japan (15‚Äì27 July), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba's trade relations with that country. During the visit he refused to visit and lay a wreath at Japan's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier commemorating soldiers lost during World War II, remarking that the Japanese \\"imperialists\\" had \\"killed millions of Asians\\".Anderson 1997, p. 431. Instead, Guevara stated that he would visit Hiroshima, where the American military had detonated an atom-bomb 14 years earlier. Despite his denunciation of Imperial Japan, Guevara considered President Truman a \\"macabre clown\\" for the bombings,Taibo 1999, p. 300. and after visiting Hiroshima and its Peace Memorial Museum he sent back a postcard to Cuba stating, \\"In order to fight better for peace, one must look at Hiroshima.\\"Che Guevara's Daughter Visits Bomb Memorial in Hiroshima by The Japan Times, 16 May 2008 Upon Guevara's return to Cuba in September 1959, it became evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures in accordance with the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low-interest \\"bonds\\", a step which put the United States on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of Camag√ºey mounted a campaign against the land redistributions and enlisted the newly-disaffected rebel leader Huber Matos, who along with the anti-Communist wing of 26 July Movement, joined them in denouncing \\"Communist encroachment\\".Anderson 1997, p. 435. During this time Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo was offering assistance to the \\"Anti- Communist Legion of the Caribbean\\" which was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force, composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans, but also of Croatians, Germans, Greeks, and right-wing mercenaries, was plotting to topple Castro's new regime. Guevara in 1960, walking through the streets of Havana with his wife Aleida March (right) Such threats were heightened when, on 4 March 1960, two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter La Coubre, which was carrying Belgian munitions from the port of Antwerp, and was docked in Havana Harbor. The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred, with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims. Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of \\"an act of terrorism\\" and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast.Casey 2009, p. 25. At the memorial service Alberto Korda took the famous photograph of Guevara, now known as Guerrillero Heroico.Casey 2009, pp. 25‚Äì50. Perceived threats prompted Castro to eliminate more \\"counter- revolutionaries\\" and to utilize Guevara to drastically increase the speed of land reform. To implement this plan, a new government agency, the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA), was established by the Cuban Government to administer the new Agrarian Reform law. INRA quickly became the most important governing body in the nation, with Guevara serving as its head in his capacity as minister of industries.Kellner 1989, p. 58. Under Guevara's command, INRA established its own 100,000-person militia, used first to help the government seize control of the expropriated land and supervise its distribution, and later to set up cooperative farms. The land confiscated included owned by United States corporations. Months later, in retaliation, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower sharply reduced United States imports of Cuban sugar (Cuba's main cash crop), which led Guevara on 10 July 1960 to address over 100,000 workers in front of the Presidential Palace at a rally to denounce the \\"economic aggression\\" of the United States.Kellner 1989, p. 55. Time Magazine reporters who met with Guevara around this time described him as \\"guid(ing) Cuba with icy calculation, vast competence, high intelligence, and a perceptive sense of humor.\\" Along with land reform, Guevara stressed the need for national improvement in literacy. Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60‚Äì76%, with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factors.Kellner 1989, p. 61. As a result, the Cuban government at Guevara's behest dubbed 1961 the \\"year of education\\" and mobilized over 100,000 volunteers into \\"literacy brigades\\", who were then sent out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate guajiros (peasants) to read and write.Latin lessons: What can we Learn from the World's most Ambitious Literacy Campaign? by The Independent, 7 November 2010 Unlike many of Guevara's later economic initiatives, this campaign was \\"a remarkable success\\". By the completion of the Cuban Literacy Campaign, 707,212 adults had been taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96%. Accompanying literacy, Guevara was also concerned with establishing universal access to higher education. To accomplish this the new regime introduced affirmative action to the universities. While announcing this new commitment, Guevara told the gathered faculty and students at the University of Las Villas that the days when education was \\"a privilege of the white middle class\\" had ended. \\"The University\\" he said, \\"must paint itself black, mulatto, worker, and peasant.\\" If it did not, he warned, the people were going to break down its doors \\"and paint the University the colors they like.\\"Anderson 1997, p. 449 =Marxist ideological influence= In September 1960, when Guevara was asked about Cuba's ideology at the First Latin American Congress, he replied, \\"If I were asked whether our revolution is Communist, I would define it as Marxist. Our revolution has discovered by its methods the paths that Marx pointed out.\\" Cuba: A Dissenting Report, by Samuel Shapiro, New Republic, 12 September 1960, pp. 8-26, 21. Consequently, when enacting and advocating Cuban policy, Guevara cited the political philosopher Karl Marx as his ideological inspiration. In defending his political stance, Guevara confidently remarked, \\"There are truths so evident, so much a part of people's knowledge, that it is now useless to discuss them. One ought to be Marxist with the same naturalness with which one is 'Newtonian' in physics, or 'Pasteurian' in biology.\\" According to Guevara, the \\"practical revolutionaries\\" of the Cuban Revolution had the goal of \\"simply fulfill(ing) laws foreseen by Marx, the scientist.\\" Using Marx's predictions and system of dialectical materialism, Guevara professed that \\"The laws of Marxism are present in the events of the Cuban Revolution, independently of what its leaders profess or fully know of those laws from a theoretical point of view.\\" = Economic vision and the \\"New Man\\" = At this stage, Guevara acquired the additional position of Finance Minister, as well as President of the National Bank. These appointments, combined with his existing position as Minister of Industries, placed Guevara at the zenith of his power, as the \\"virtual czar\\" of the Cuban economy. As a consequence of his position at the head of the central bank, it became Guevara's duty to sign the Cuban currency, which per custom bore his signature. Instead of using his full name, he signed the bills solely \\"Che\\".Crompton 2009, p. 71. It was through this symbolic act, which horrified many in the Cuban financial sector, that Guevara signaled his distaste for money and the class distinctions it brought about. Guevara's long time friend Ricardo Rojo later remarked that \\"the day he signed Che on the bills, (he) literally knocked the props from under the widespread belief that money was sacred.\\"Kellner 1989, p. 60. existentialist philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at his office in Havana, March 1960. Sartre later wrote that Che was \\"the most complete human being of our time\\". In addition to Spanish, Guevara was fluent in French.Dumur 1964 a 1964 video interview of Che Guevara speaking French (with English subtitles). In an effort to eliminate social inequalities, Guevara and Cuba's new leadership had moved to swiftly transform the political and economic base of the country through nationalizing factories, banks, and businesses, while attempting to ensure affordable housing, healthcare, and employment for all Cubans.Hansing 2002, pp 41‚Äì42. In order for a genuine transformation of consciousness to take root, it was believed that such structural changes had to be accompanied by a conversion in people's social relations and values. Believing that the attitudes in Cuba towards race, women, individualism, and manual labor were the product of the island's outdated past, all individuals were urged to view each other as equals and take on the values of what Guevara termed \\"el Hombre Nuevo\\" (the New Man). Guevara hoped his \\"new man\\" to be ultimately \\"selfless and cooperative, obedient and hard working, gender-blind, incorruptible, non- materialistic, and anti-imperialist\\". To accomplish this, Guevara emphasized the tenets of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, and wanted to use the state to emphasize qualities such as egalitarianism and self-sacrifice, at the same time as \\"unity, equality, and freedom\\" became the new maxims. Guevara's first desired economic goal of the new man, which coincided with his aversion for wealth condensation and economic inequality, was to see a nationwide elimination of material incentives in favor of moral ones. He negatively viewed capitalism as a \\"contest among wolves\\" where \\"one can only win at the cost of others\\" and thus desired to see the creation of a \\"new man and woman\\". Guevara continually stressed that a socialist economy in itself is not \\"worth the effort, sacrifice, and risks of war and destruction\\" if it ends up encouraging \\"greed and individual ambition at the expense of collective spirit\\".Kellner 1989, p. 62. A primary goal of Guevara's thus became to reform \\"individual consciousness\\" and values to produce better workers and citizens. In his view, Cuba's \\"new man\\" would be able to overcome the \\"egotism\\" and \\"selfishness\\" that he loathed and discerned was uniquely characteristic of individuals in capitalist societies. To promote this concept of a \\"new man\\", the government also created a series of party-dominated institutions and mechanisms on all levels of society, which included organizations such as labor groups, youth leagues, women's groups, community centers, and houses of culture to promote state-sponsored art, music, and literature. In congruence with this, all educational, mass media, and artistic community based facilities were nationalized and utilized to instill the government's official socialist ideology. In describing this new method of \\"development\\", Guevara stated: A further integral part of fostering a sense of \\"unity between the individual and the mass\\", Guevara believed, was volunteer work and will. To display this, Guevara \\"led by example\\", working \\"endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane\\" on his day off.PBS: Che Guevara, Popular but Ineffective. He was known for working 36 hours at a stretch, calling meetings after midnight, and eating on the run. Such behavior was emblematic of Guevara's new program of moral incentives, where each worker was now required to meet a quota and produce a certain quantity of goods. As a replacement for the pay increases abolished by Guevara, workers who exceeded their quota now only received a certificate of commendation, while workers who failed to meet their quotas were given a pay cut. Guevara unapologetically defended his personal philosophy towards motivation and work, stating: Guevara fishing off the coast of Havana, on 15 May 1960. Along with Castro, Guevara competed with expatriate author Ernest Hemingway at what was known as the \\"Hemingway Fishing Contest\\". In the face of a loss of commercial connections with Western states, Guevara tried to replace them with closer commercial relationships with Eastern Bloc states, visiting a number of Marxist states and signing trade agreements with them. At the end of 1960 he visited Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Hungary and East Germany and signed, for instance, a trade agreement in East Berlin on 17 December 1960. Such agreements helped Cuba's economy to a certain degree but also had the disadvantage of a growing economic dependency on the Eastern Bloc. It was also in East Germany where Guevara met Tamara Bunke (later known as \\"Tania\\"), who was assigned as his interpreter, and who joined him years later, and was killed with him in Bolivia. Whatever the merits or demerits of Guevara's economic principles, his programs were unsuccessful,Kellner 1989, p. 63. and accompanied a rapid drop in productivity and a rapid rise in absenteeism.Kellner 1989, p. 74. In a meeting with French economist Rene Dumont, Guevara blamed the inadequacy of the Agrarian Reform Law enacted by the Cuban government in 1959, which turned large plantations into farm co- operatives or split up land amongst peasants.Taibo 1999, p. 269. In Guevara's opinion, this situation continued to promote a \\"heightened sense of individual ownership\\" in which workers could not see the positive social benefits of their labor, leading them to instead seek individual material gain as before.Taibo 1999, p. 306. Decades later, Che's former deputy Ernesto Betancourt, subsequently the director of the US government-funded Radio Mart√≠ and an early ally turned Castro-critic, accused Guevara of being \\"ignorant of the most elementary economic principles.\\"Vargas Llosa 2005. = Bay of Pigs, and missile crisis = On 17 April 1961, 1,400 U.S.-trained Cuban exiles invaded Cuba during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Guevara did not play a key role in the fighting, as one day before the invasion a warship carrying Marines faked an invasion off the West Coast of Pinar del R√≠o and drew forces commanded by Guevara to that region. However, historians give him a share of credit for the victory as he was director of instruction for Cuba's armed forces at the time. Author Tad Szulc in his explanation of the Cuban victory, assigns Guevara partial credit, stating: \\"The revolutionaries won because Che Guevara, as the head of the Instruction Department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in charge of the militia training program, had done so well in preparing 200,000 men and women for war.\\" It was also during this deployment that he suffered a bullet grazing to the cheek when his pistol fell out of its holster and accidentally discharged.Anderson 1997, p. 507. Guevara (left) and Fidel Castro, photographed by Alberto Korda in 1961 In August 1961, during an economic conference of the Organization of American States in Punta del Este, Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note of \\"gratitude\\" to United States President John F. Kennedy through Richard N. Goodwin, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. It read \\"Thanks for Playa Gir√≥n (Bay of Pigs). Before the invasion, the revolution was shaky. Now it's stronger than ever.\\"Anderson 1997, p. 509. In response to United States Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon presenting the Alliance for Progress for ratification by the meeting, Guevara antagonistically attacked the United States claim of being a \\"democracy\\", stating that such a system was not compatible with \\"financial oligarchy, discrimination against blacks, and outrages by the Ku Klux Klan\\".\\"Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics\\" speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on 8 August 1961. Guevara continued, speaking out against the \\"persecution\\" that in his view \\"drove scientists like Oppenheimer from their posts, deprived the world for years of the marvelous voice of Paul Robeson, and sent the Rosenbergs to their deaths against the protests of a shocked world.\\" Guevara ended his remarks by insinuating that the United States was not interested in real reforms, sardonically quipping that \\"U.S. experts never talk about agrarian reform; they prefer a safe subject, like a better water supply. In short, they seem to prepare the revolution of the toilets.\\"Kellner 1989, p. 78. Nevertheless, Goodwin stated in his memo to President Kennedy following the meeting that Guevara viewed him as someone of the \\"newer generation\\" and that Guevara, whom Goodwin alleged sent a message to him the day after the meeting through one of the meeting's Argentine participants whom he described as \\"Darretta,\\" also viewed the conversation which the two had as \\"quite profitable.\\"http://americancentury.omeka.wlu.edu/files/original/3e027f808b843322ec9f28e8e78e93b7.pdf Guevara, who was practically the architect of the Soviet‚ÄìCuban relationship,Anderson 1997, p. 492. then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.Anderson 1997, p. 530. A few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the Daily Worker, Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.Anderson 1997, p. 545. While expounding on the incident later, Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global \\"imperialist aggression\\" would ultimately have been worth the possibility of \\"millions of atomic war victims\\".Guevara 1997, p 304 The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the world's two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward, he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.Kellner 1989, p. 73. International diplomacy Countries Che Guevara visited (red) and those in which he participated in armed revolution (green) In December 1964, Che Guevara had emerged as a \\"revolutionary statesman of world stature\\" and thus traveled to New York City as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the United Nations. On 11 December 1964, during Guevara's hour-long, impassioned address at the UN, he criticized the United Nations' inability to confront the \\"brutal policy of apartheid\\" in South Africa, asking \\"Can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?\\"\\"Colonialism is Doomed\\" speech to the 19th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York City by Cuban representative Che Guevara on 11 December 1964. Guevara then denounced the United States policy towards their black population, stating: An indignant Guevara ended his speech by reciting the Second Declaration of Havana, decreeing Latin America a \\"family of 200 million brothers who suffer the same miseries\\". This \\"epic\\", Guevara declared, would be written by the \\"hungry Indian masses, peasants without land, exploited workers, and progressive masses\\". To Guevara the conflict was a struggle of masses and ideas, which would be carried forth by those \\"mistreated and scorned by imperialism\\" who were previously considered \\"a weak and submissive flock\\". With this \\"flock\\", Guevara now asserted, \\"Yankee monopoly capitalism\\" now terrifyingly saw their \\"gravediggers\\". It would be during this \\"hour of vindication\\", Guevara pronounced, that the \\"anonymous mass\\" would begin to write its own history \\"with its own blood\\" and reclaim those \\"rights that were laughed at by one and all for 500 years\\". Guevara closed his remarks to the General Assembly by hypothesizing that this \\"wave of anger\\" would \\"sweep the lands of Latin America\\" and that the labor masses who \\"turn the wheel of history\\" were now, for the first time, \\"awakening from the long, brutalizing sleep to which they had been subjected\\". Guevara later learned there had been two failed attempts on his life by Cuban exiles during his stop at the UN complex.Bazooka Fired at UN as Cuban Speaks by Homer Bigart, The New York Times, 12 December 1964, p. 1. The first from Molly Gonzales, who tried to break through barricades upon his arrival with a seven-inch hunting knife, and later during his address by Guillermo Novo, who fired a timer-initiated bazooka from a boat in the East River at the United Nations Headquarters, but missed and was off target. Afterwards Guevara commented on both incidents, stating that \\"it is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than by a man with a gun\\", while adding with a languid wave of his cigar that the explosion had \\"given the whole thing more flavor\\". Walking through Red Square in Moscow, November 1964 While in New York, Guevara appeared on the CBS Sunday news program Face the Nation,CBS Video of Che Guevara being interviewed by Face the Nation on 13 December 1964, (29:11) and met with a wide range of people, from United States Senator Eugene McCarthyHart 2004, p. 271. to associates of Malcolm X. The latter expressed his admiration, declaring Guevara \\"one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now\\" while reading a statement from him to a crowd at the Audubon Ballroom.Anderson 1997, p. 618. On 17 December, Guevara left New York for Paris, France, and from there embarked on a three-month world tour that included visits to the People's Republic of China, North Korea, the United Arab Republic, Algeria, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Dahomey, Congo-Brazzaville and Tanzania, with stops in Ireland and Prague. While in Ireland, Guevara embraced his own Irish heritage, celebrating Saint Patrick's Day in Limerick city. He wrote to his father on this visit, humorously stating \\"I am in this green Ireland of your ancestors. When they found out, the television [station] came to ask me about the Lynch genealogy, but in case they were horse thieves or something like that, I didn't say much.\\"Gerry Adams Featured in New Che Guevara Documentary by Kenneth Haynes, Irish Central, 8 September 2009 During this voyage, he wrote a letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of a Uruguayan weekly, which was later retitled Socialism and Man in Cuba.\\"Socialism and Man in Cuba\\" A letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of Marcha, a weekly newspaper published in Montevideo, Uruguay; published as \\"From Algiers, for Marcha: The Cuban Revolution Today\\" by Che Guevara on 12 March 1965. Outlined in the treatise was Guevara's summons for the creation of a new consciousness, a new status of work, and a new role of the individual. He also laid out the reasoning behind his anti- capitalist sentiments, stating: Guevara ended the essay by declaring that \\"the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love\\" and beckoning on all revolutionaries to \\"strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into acts that serve as examples\\", thus becoming \\"a moving force\\". The genesis for Guevara's assertions relied on the fact that he believed the example of the Cuban Revolution was \\"something spiritual that would transcend all borders\\". =Algiers, the Soviets, and China= In Algiers, Algeria, on 24 February 1965, Guevara made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity.Guevara 1969, p. 350. He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries, accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries. He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of imperialism.Guevara 1969, pp. 352‚Äì59. Having criticized the Soviet Union (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on 14 March to a solemn reception by Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro, Osvaldo Dortic√≥s and Carlos Rafael Rodr√≠guez at the Havana airport. As revealed in his last public speech in Algiers, Guevara had come to view the Northern Hemisphere, led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the Southern Hemisphere. He strongly supported Communist North Vietnam in the Vietnam War, and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create \\"many Vietnams\\".Message to the Tricontinental (1967) A letter sent by Che Guevara from his jungle camp in Bolivia, to the Tricontinental Solidarity Organisation in Havana, Cuba, in the Spring of 1967. Che's denunciations of the Soviets made him popular among intellectuals and artists of the Western European left who had lost faith in the Soviet Union, while his condemnation of imperialism and call to revolution inspired young radical students in the United States, who were impatient for societal change.Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer's Dream by Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times, 20 April 2009 In Guevara's private writings from this time (since released), he displays his growing criticism of the Soviet political economy, believing that the Soviets had \\"forgotten Marx\\".Ernesto 'Che' Guevara: A Rebel Against Soviet Political Economy by Helen Yaffe (author of Che Guevara: The Economics of Revolution), 2006 This led Guevara to denounce a range of Soviet practices including what he saw as their attempt to \\"air-brush the inherent violence of class struggle integral to the transition from capitalism to socialism\\", their \\"dangerous\\" policy of peaceful co-existence with the United States, their failure to push for a \\"change in consciousness\\" towards the idea of work, and their attempt to \\"liberalize\\" the socialist economy. Guevara wanted the complete elimination of money, interest, commodity production, the market economy, and \\"mercantile relationships\\": all conditions that the Soviets argued would only disappear when world communism was achieved. Disagreeing with this incrementalist approach, Guevara criticized the Soviet Manual of Political Economy, correctly predicting that if USSR did not abolish the law of value (as Guevara desired), it would eventually return to capitalism. Two weeks after his Algiers speech and his return to Cuba, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether.Abrams 2010, p. 100 His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the Cuban industrialization scheme he had advocated while minister of industries, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials who disapproved of Guevara's pro-Chinese Communist stance on the Sino-Soviet split, and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.Abrams 2010, p. 103. Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on 16 June 1965, that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Still, rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba concerning the missing Guevara's whereabouts. On 3 October 1965, Castro publicly revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara around seven months earlier which was later titled Che Guevara's \\"farewell letter\\". In the letter, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the Cuban government and communist party, and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.Guevara 1965. Congo 37-year-old Guevara, holding a Congolese baby and standing with a fellow Afro-Cuban soldier in the Congo Crisis, 1965 In early 1965, Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing conflict in the Congo. According to Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella, Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link and so had enormous revolutionary potential.Ben Bella 1997. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had fraternal relations with Che since his 1959 visit, saw Guevara's plan to fight in Congo as \\"unwise\\" and warned that he would become a \\"Tarzan\\" figure, doomed to failure.Anderson 1997, p. 624. Despite the warning, Guevara traveled to Congo using the alias Ram√≥n Ben√≠tez.Anderson 1997, p. 629. He led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing Congo crisis. Guevara, his second-in-command V√≠ctor Dreke, and 12 other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in Congo on 24 April 1965, and a contingent of approximately 100 Afro-Cubans joined them soon afterward.G√°lvez 1999, p. 62.Gott 2004 p. 219. For a time, they collaborated with guerrilla leader Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, who had helped supporters of the overthrown president Patrice Lumumba to lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier. As an admirer of the late Lumumba, Guevara declared that his \\"murder should be a lesson for all of us\\".Kellner 1989, p. 86. Guevara, with limited knowledge of Swahili and the local languages, was assigned a teenage interpreter, Freddy Ilanga. Over the course of seven months, Ilanga grew to \\"admire the hard-working Guevara\\", who \\"showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites\\".DR Congo's Rebel-Turned-Brain Surgeon by Mark Doyle, BBC World Affairs, 13 December 2005. Guevara soon became disillusioned with the poor discipline of Kabila's troops and later dismissed him, stating \\"nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour\\".BBC News 17 January 2001. As an additional obstacle, white mercenary troops of the Congo National Army, led by Mike Hoare and supported by anti-Castro Cuban pilots and the CIA, thwarted Guevara's movements from his base camp in the mountains near the village of Fizi on Lake Tanganyika in southeast Congo. They were able to monitor his communications and so pre-empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines. Although Guevara tried to conceal his presence in Congo, the United States government knew his location and activities. The National Security Agency was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the , a floating listening post that continuously cruised the Indian Ocean off Dar es Salaam for that purpose.\\"The intercept operators knew that Dar-es-Salaam was serving as a communications center for the fighters, receiving messages from Castro in Cuba and relaying them on to the guerrillas deep in the bush.\\" (Bamford 2002, p. 181) Zenith Trans-Oceanic shortwave radio receiver are (seated from the left) Rogelio Oliva, Jos√© Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Tamayo (known as \\"Mbili\\" in the Congo and \\"Ricardo\\" in Bolivia), and Guevara. Standing behind them is Roberto S√°nchez (\\"Lawton\\" in Cuba and \\"Changa\\" in the Congo), 1965. Guevara's aim was to export the revolution by instructing local anti-Mobutu Simba fighters in Marxist ideology and foco theory strategies of guerrilla warfare. In his Congo Diary book, he cites a combination of incompetence, intransigence and infighting among the Congolese rebels as key reasons for the revolt's failure.Ireland's Own 2000. Later that year, on 20 November 1965, suffering from dysentery and acute asthma, and disheartened after seven months of defeats and inactivity, Guevara left Congo with the six Cuban survivors of his 12-man column. Guevara stated that he had planned to send the wounded back to Cuba and fight in Congo alone until his death, as a revolutionary example. But after being urged by his comrades, and two Cuban emissaries personally sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave Africa. During that day and night, Guevara's forces quietly took down their base camp, burned their huts, and destroyed or threw weapons into Lake Tanganyika that they could not take with them, before crossing the border by boat into Tanzania at night and traveling by land to Dar es Salaam. In speaking about his experience in Congo months later, Guevara concluded that he left rather than fight to the death because: \\"The human element failed. There is no will to fight. The [rebel] leaders are corrupt. In a word ... there was nothing to do.\\"Kellner 1989, p. 87. Guevara also declared that \\"we can not liberate, all by ourselves, a country that does not want to fight.\\"From Cuba to Congo, Dream to Disaster for Che Guevara by The Guardian, 12 August 2000 A few weeks later, he wrote the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, that began: \\"This is the story of a failure.\\"Guevara 2000, p. 1. Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba, because Castro had already made public Guevara's \\"farewell letter\\"‚Äîa letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death‚Äîwherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world.Casta√±eda 1998, p. 316. As a result, Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely at the Cuban embassy in Dar es Salaam and later at a Cuban safehouse in Prague.Che Guevara's Central Bohemian Hideaway article and audio by Ian Willoughby, ƒåesk√Ω rozhlas, 27 June 2010 While in Europe, Guevara made a secret visit to former Argentine president Juan Per√≥n who lived in exile in Francoist Spain where he confided in Per√≥n about his new plan to formulate a communist revolution to bring all of Latin America under socialist control. Per√≥n warned Guevara that his plans for implementing a communist revolution throughout Latin America, starting with Bolivia, would be suicidal and futile, but Guevara's mind was already made up. Later, Per√≥n remarked that Guevara was \\"an immature utopian... but one of us. I am happy for it to be so because he is giving the Yankees a real headache.\\" During this time abroad, Guevara compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy and the other on economics. As Guevara prepared for Bolivia, he secretly traveled back to Cuba on 21 July 1966 to visit Castro, as well as to see his wife and to write a last letter to his five children to be read upon his death, which ended with him instructing them: Bolivia In late 1966, Guevara's location was still not public knowledge, although representatives of Mozambique's independence movement, the FRELIMO, reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project, an offer which they ultimately rejected.Mittleman 1981, p. 38. In a speech at the 1967 International Workers' Day rally in Havana, the acting minister of the armed forces, Major Juan Almeida, announced that Guevara was \\"serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America\\". Before he departed for Bolivia, Guevara altered his appearance by shaving off his beard and much of his hair, also dying it grey so that he was unrecognizable as Che Guevara.Jacobson, Sid and Ernie Col√≥n. Che: A Graphic Biography. Hill and Wang, 2009. 96‚Äì97. On 3 November 1966, Guevara secretly arrived in La Paz on a flight from Montevideo, under the false name Adolfo Mena Gonz√°lez, posing as a middle-aged Uruguayan businessman working for the Organization of American States.Jacobson, Sid and Ernie Col√≥n. Che: A Graphic Biography. Hill and Wang, 2009. 98. Guevara in rural Bolivia, shortly before his death (1967) Three days after his arrival in Bolivia, Guevara left La Paz for the rural south east region of the country to form his guerrilla army. Guevara's first base camp was located in the montane dry forest in the remote √ëancahuaz√∫ region. Training at the camp in the √ëancahuaz√∫ valley proved to be hazardous, and little was accomplished in way of building a guerrilla army. The Argentine- born East German operative Hayd√©e Tamara Bunke Bider, better known by her nom de guerre \\"Tania\\", had been installed as Che's primary agent in La Paz.Selvage 1985.Anderson 1997, p. 693. Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 menMembers of Che Guevara's Guerrilla Movement in Bolivia by the Latin American Studies Organization and operating as the ELN (Ej√©rcito de Liberaci√≥n Nacional de Bolivia, \\"National Liberation Army of Bolivia\\"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian army regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region during the early months of 1967. As a result of Guevara's units' winning several skirmishes against Bolivian troops in the spring and summer of 1967, the Bolivian government began to overestimate the true size of the guerrilla force.Kellner 1989, p. 97. Researchers hypothesize that Guevara's plan for fomenting a revolution in Bolivia failed for an array of reasons: * Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents that he did not receive, nor did he receive support from Bolivia's Communist Party under the leadership of Mario Monje, which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana. In Guevara's own diary captured after his death, he wrote about the Communist Party of Bolivia, which he characterized as \\"distrustful, disloyal and stupid\\".\\"Bidding for Che\\", Time Magazine, 15 December 1967. * He had expected to deal only with the Bolivian military, who were poorly trained and equipped, and was unaware that the United States government had sent a team of the CIA's Special Activities Division commandos and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army was also trained, advised, and supplied by U.S. Army Special Forces, including an elite battalion of U.S. Rangers trained in jungle warfare that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the location of Guevara's guerrillas.US Army 1967 and Ryan 1998, pp. 82‚Äì102, inter alia. \\"US military personnel in Bolivia never exceeded 53 advisers, including a sixteen-man Mobile Training Team from the 8th Special Forces Group based at Fort Gulick, Panama Canal Zone\\" (Selvage 1985). * He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. The two shortwave radio transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty; thus, the guerrillas were unable to communicate and be resupplied, leaving them isolated and stranded. In addition, Guevara's known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local rebel leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.Guevara 1972. This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.Casta√±eda 1998, pp. 107‚Äì112; 131‚Äì132. The end result was that Guevara was unable to attract inhabitants of the local area to join his militia during the eleven months he attempted recruitment. Many of the inhabitants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the guerrillas and their movements in the area. Near the end of the Bolivian venture, Guevara wrote in his diary that \\"the peasants do not give us any help, and they are turning into informers.\\"Wright 2000, p. 86. =Capture and death= Monument to Guevara in La Higuera F√©lix Rodr√≠guez, a Cuban exile turned CIA Special Activities Division operative, advised Bolivian troops during the hunt for Guevara in Bolivia.Rodriguez and Weisman 1989. In addition, the 2007 documentary My Enemy's Enemy alleges that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara's eventual capture.Barbie \\"Boasted of Hunting Down Che\\" by David Smith, The Observer, 23 December 2007. On 7 October 1967, an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine.Green Beret Behind the Capture of Che Guevara by Richard Gott, The Age, 8 September 2010 On the morning of 8 October, they encircled the area with two companies numbering 180 soldiers and advanced into the ravine triggering a battle where Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with Sime√≥n Cuba Sarabia. Che's biographer Jon Lee Anderson reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca's account: that as the Bolivian Rangers approached, a twice-wounded Guevara, his gun rendered useless, threw up his arms in surrender and shouted to the soldiers: \\"Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead.\\"Anderson 1997, p. 733. Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of La Higuera on the evening of 8 October. For the next half day, Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and only spoke quietly to Bolivian soldiers. One of those Bolivian soldiers, a helicopter pilot named Jaime Nino de Guzman, describes Che as looking \\"dreadful\\". According to Guzman, Guevara was shot through the right calf, his hair was matted with dirt, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths. Despite his haggard appearance, he recounts that \\"Che held his head high, looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke.\\" De Guzman states that he \\"took pity\\" and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe, and that Guevara then smiled and thanked him.\\"The Man Who Buried Che \\" by Juan O. Tamayo, Miami Herald, 19 September 1997. Later on the night of 8 October, Guevara‚Äîdespite having his hands tied‚Äîkicked a Bolivian army officer, named Captain Espinosa, against a wall after the officer entered the schoolhouse and tried to snatch Guevara's pipe from his mouth as a souvenir while he was still smoking it. In another instance of defiance, Guevara spat in the face of Bolivian Rear Admiral Ugarteche, who attempted to question Guevara a few hours before his execution. The following morning on 9 October, Guevara asked to see the school teacher of the village, a 22-year-old woman named Julia Cortez. She later stated that she found Guevara to be an \\"agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance\\" and that during their conversation she found herself \\"unable to look him in the eye\\" because his \\"gaze was unbearable, piercing, and so tranquil\\". During their short conversation, Guevara pointed out to Cortez the poor condition of the schoolhouse, stating that it was \\"anti- pedagogical\\" to expect campesino students to be educated there, while \\"government officials drive Mercedes cars\\"; Guevara said \\"that's what we are fighting against.\\" Location of Vallegrande in Bolivia Later that morning on 9 October, Bolivian President Ren√© Barrientos ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed to the unit holding Guevara by F√©lix Rodr√≠guez reportedly despite the United States government's desire that Guevara be taken to Panama for further interrogation.Grant 2007 The executioner who volunteered to kill Guevara was Mario Ter√°n, a 27-year-old sergeant in the Bolivian army who while half-drunk requested to shoot Guevara because three of his friends from B Company, all with the same first name of \\"Mario\\", had been killed in a firefight several days earlier with Guevara's band of guerrillas. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story that the Bolivian government planned to release to the public, F√©lix Rodr√≠guez ordered Ter√°n not to shoot Guevara in the head, but to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.Grant 2007. Ren√© Barrientos has never revealed his motives for ordering the summary execution of Guevara rather than putting him on trial or expelling him from the country or turning him over to the United States authorities. Gary Prado, the Bolivian captain in command of the army company that captured Guevara, said that the reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara were so there could be no possibility for Guevara to escape from prison, and also so there could be no drama of a public trial where adverse publicity might happen.Almudevar, Lola. \\"Bolivia marks capture, execution of 'Che' Guevara 40 years ago\\", San Francisco Chronicle. 9 October 2007; retrieved 7 November 2009. About 30 minutes before Guevara was killed, F√©lix Rodr√≠guez attempted to question him about the whereabouts of other guerrilla fighters who were currently at large, but Guevara continued to remain silent. Rodr√≠guez, assisted by a few Bolivian soldiers, helped Guevara to his feet and took him outside the hut to parade him before other Bolivian soldiers where he posed with Guevara for a photo opportunity where one soldier took a photograph of Rodr√≠guez and other soldiers standing alongside Guevara. Afterwards, Rodr√≠guez told Guevara that he was going to be executed. A little later, Guevara was asked by one of the Bolivian soldiers guarding him if he was thinking about his own immortality. \\"No,\\" he replied, \\"I'm thinking about the immortality of the revolution.\\"Time magazine 1970. A few minutes later, Sergeant Ter√°n entered the hut to shoot him, whereupon Guevara reportedly stood up and spoke to Ter√°n what were his last words: \\"I know you've come to kill me. Shoot, coward! You are only going to kill a man!\\" Ter√°n hesitated, then pointed his self-loading M2 carbine at Guevara and opened fire, hitting him in the arms and legs.Anderson 1997, p. 739. Then, as Guevara writhed on the ground, apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out, Ter√°n fired another burst, fatally wounding him in the chest. Guevara was pronounced dead at 1:10 pm local time according to Rodr√≠guez. In all, Guevara was shot nine times by Ter√°n. This included five times in his legs, once in the right shoulder and arm, and once in the chest and throat. Months earlier, during his last public declaration to the Tricontinental Conference, Guevara had written his own epitaph, stating: \\"Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons.\\"Obituary: Che Guevara, Marxist Architect of Revolution by Richard Bourne, The Guardian, 11 October 1967 Post- execution and memorial 17pxFace Side angle Shoes After his execution, Guevara's body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby Vallegrande, where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Malta.Almudevar 2007 and Gott 2005. Several witnesses were called to confirm his identity, key amongst them the British journalist Richard Gott, the only witness to have met Guevara when he was alive. Put on display, as hundreds of local residents filed past the body, Guevara's corpse was considered by many to represent a \\"Christ-like\\" visage, with some even surreptitiously clipping locks of his hair as divine relics.Casey 2009, p. 179. Such comparisons were further extended when English art critic John Berger, two weeks later upon seeing the post-mortem photographs, observed that they resembled two famous paintings: Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp and Andrea Mantegna's Lamentation over the Dead Christ.Casey 2009, p. 183. There were also four correspondents present when Guevara's body arrived in Vallegrande, including Bj√∂rn Kumm of the Swedish Aftonbladet, who described the scene in a 11 November 1967, exclusive for The New Republic.The Death of Che Guevara by Bjorn Kumm, The New Republic, Originally published on 11 November 1967. A declassified memorandum dated 11 October 1967 to United States President Lyndon B. Johnson from his National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow, called the decision to kill Guevara \\"stupid\\" but \\"understandable from a Bolivian standpoint\\".Lacey 2007a. After the execution, Rodr√≠guez took several of Guevara's personal items, including a watch which he continued to wear many years later, often showing them to reporters during the ensuing years.After the Cuban revolution, seeing that Guevara had no watch, his friend Oscarito Fern√°ndez Mell gave him his own gold watch. Sometime later, Che handed him a piece of paper; a receipt from the National Bank declaring that Mell had \\"donated\\" his gold wristband to Cuba's gold reserve. Guevara was still wearing his watch, but it now had a leather wristband (Anderson 1997, p. 503). Today, some of these belongings, including his flashlight, are on display at the CIA.Kornbluh 1997. After a military doctor dismembered his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara's body to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated. The hands were sent to Buenos Aires for fingerprint identification. They were later sent to Cuba. Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n, in Havana, Cuba. Aside the Ministry of the Interior building where Guevara once worked is a 5-story steel outline of his face. Under the image is Guevara's motto, the Spanish phrase: \\"Hasta la Victoria Siempre\\" (English: Until Victory, always). On 15 October in Havana, Fidel Castro publicly acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout Cuba.Anderson 1997, p. 740. On 18 October, Castro addressed a crowd of one million mourners in Havana's Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n and spoke about Guevara's character as a revolutionary.Anderson 1997, p. 741. Fidel Castro closed his impassioned eulogy thus: Also removed when Guevara was captured were his 30,000-word, hand-written diary, a collection of his personal poetry, and a short story he had authored about a young Communist guerrilla who learns to overcome his fears.\\"Bidding for Che\\", Time Magazine, 15 December 1967. His diary documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia,Guevara 1967. with the first entry on 7 November 1966, shortly after his arrival at the farm in √ëancahuaz√∫, and the last dated 7 October 1967, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely because of discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Communist Party of Bolivia that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected, and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, partly because the guerrilla group had learned Quechua, unaware that the local language was actually a Tup√≠‚ÄìGuaran√≠ language.Ryan 1998, p. 45. As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.Ryan 1998, p. 104. The Bolivian diary was quickly and crudely translated by Ramparts magazine and circulated around the world.Ryan 1998, p. 148. There are at least four additional diaries in existence‚Äîthose of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias \\"Braulio\\"), Harry Villegas Tamayo (\\"Pombo\\"), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez (\\"Rolando\\") and Dariel Alarc√≥n Ram√≠rez (\\"Benigno\\")Ram√≠rez 1997.‚Äîeach of which reveals additional aspects of the events. French intellectual R√©gis Debray, who was captured in April 1967 while with Guevara in Bolivia, gave an interview from prison in August 1968, in which he enlarged on the circumstances of Guevara's capture. Debray, who had lived with Guevara's band of guerrillas for a short time, said that in his view they were \\"victims of the forest\\" and thus \\"eaten by the jungle\\". Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara's men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men. Debray recounts that Guevara and the others had been suffering an \\"illness\\" which caused their hands and feet to swell into \\"mounds of flesh\\" to the point where you could not discern the fingers on their hands. Debray described Guevara as \\"optimistic about the future of Latin America\\" despite the futile situation, and remarked that Guevara was \\"resigned to die in the knowledge that his death would be a sort of renaissance\\", noting that Guevara perceived death \\"as a promise of rebirth\\" and \\"ritual of renewal\\". To a certain extent, this belief by Guevara of a metaphorical resurrection came true. While pictures of the dead Guevara were being circulated and the circumstances of his death were being debated, Che's legend began to spread. Demonstrations in protest against his \\"assassination\\" occurred throughout the world, and articles, tributes, and poems were written about his life and death.Durschmied 2002, pp. 307‚Äì09. Rallies in support of Guevara were held from \\"Mexico to Santiago, Algiers to Angola, and Cairo to Calcutta\\".Durschmied 2002, p. 305. The population of Budapest and Prague lit candles to honor Guevara's passing; and the picture of a smiling Che appeared in London and Paris.Durschmied 2002, pp. 305‚Äì06. When a few months later riots broke out in Berlin, France, and Chicago, and the unrest spread to the American college campuses, young men and women wore Che Guevara T-shirts and carried his pictures during their protest marches. In the view of military historian Erik Durschmied: \\"In those heady months of 1968, Che Guevara was not dead. He was very much alive.\\"Durschmied 2002, p. 306. =Retrieval of remains= Che Guevara's Monument and Mausoleum in Santa Clara, Cuba In late 1995, the retired Bolivian General Mario Vargas revealed to Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, that Guevara's corpse lay near a Vallegrande airstrip. The result was a multi- national search for the remains, which lasted more than a year. In July 1997 a team of Cuban geologists and Argentine forensic anthropologists discovered the remnants of seven bodies in two mass graves, including one man without hands (as Guevara would have been). Bolivian government officials with the Ministry of Interior later identified the body as Guevara when the excavated teeth \\"perfectly matched\\" a plaster mold of Che's teeth made in Cuba prior to his Congolese expedition. The \\"clincher\\" then arrived when Argentine forensic anthropologist Alejandro Inchaurregui inspected the inside hidden pocket of a blue jacket dug up next to the handless cadaver and found a small bag of pipe tobacco. Nino de Guzman, the Bolivian helicopter pilot who had given Che a small bag of tobacco, later remarked that he \\"had serious doubts\\" at first and \\"thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che\\"; but \\"after hearing about the tobacco pouch, I have no doubts.\\" On 17 October 1997, Guevara's remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built mausoleum in the Cuban city of Santa Clara, where he had commanded over the decisive military victory of the Cuban Revolution.Cuba salutes 'Che' Guevara: Revolutionary Icon Finally Laid to Rest, CNN, 17 October 1997 In July 2008, the Bolivian government of Evo Morales unveiled Guevara's formerly-sealed diaries composed in two frayed notebooks, along with a logbook and several black-and-white photographs. At this event Bolivia's vice-minister of culture, Pablo Groux, expressed that there were plans to publish photographs of every handwritten page later in the year.Bolivia unveils original Che Guevara diary by Eduardo Garcia, Reuters, 7 July 2008. Meanwhile, in August 2009 anthropologists working for Bolivia's Justice Ministry discovered and unearthed the bodies of five of Guevara's fellow guerrillas near the Bolivian town of Teoponte.Slain Che Guevara Soldiers Found? video report by National Geographic, 21 August 2009. Legacy A stylized graphic of Guevara's face on a flag above the words \\"El Che Vive!\\" (Che Lives!) Guevara's life and legacy remain contentious. The perceived contradictions of his ethos at various points in his life have created a complex character of duality, one who was \\"able to wield the pen and submachine gun with equal skill\\", while prophesying that \\"the most important revolutionary ambition was to see man liberated from his alienation\\".L√∂wy 1973, p. 7.L√∂wy 1973, p. 33. Guevara's paradoxical standing is further complicated by his array of seemingly diametrically opposed qualities. A secular humanist and sympathetic practitioner of medicine who did not hesitate to shoot his enemies, a celebrated internationalist leader who advocated violence to enforce a utopian philosophy of the collective good, an idealistic intellectual who loved literature but refused to allow dissent, an anti- imperialist Marxist insurgent who was radically willing to forge a poverty- less new world on the apocalyptic ashes of the old one, and finally, an outspoken anti-capitalist whose image has been commoditized. Che's history continues to be rewritten and re-imagined.L√∂wy 1973, pp. 7, 9, 15, 25, 75, 106.The Spark That Does Not Die by Michael L√∂wy, International Viewpoint, July 1997 Moreover, sociologist Michael L√∂wy contends that the many facets of Guevara's life (i.e. doctor and economist, revolutionary and banker, military theoretician and ambassador, deep thinker and political agitator) illuminated the rise of the \\"Che myth\\", allowing him to be invariably crystallized in his many metanarrative roles as a \\"Red Robin Hood, Don Quixote of communism, new Garibaldi, Marxist Saint Just, Cid Campeador of the Wretched of the Earth, Sir Galahad of the beggars ... and Bolshevik devil who haunts the dreams of the rich, kindling braziers of subversion all over the world\\".1973 coup that installed the Pinochet regime in Chile As such, various notable individuals have lauded Guevara; for example, Nelson Mandela referred to him as \\"an inspiration for every human being who loves freedom\\", while Jean-Paul Sartre described him as \\"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\\".Moynihan 2006. Others who have expressed their admiration include authors Graham Greene, who remarked that Guevara \\"represented the idea of gallantry, chivalry, and adventure\\",Sinclair 1968/2006, p. 80. and Susan Sontag, who supposed that \\"[Che's] goal was nothing less than the cause of humanity itself.\\"Sinclair 1968/2006, p. 127. In the Pan-African community philosopher Frantz Fanon professed Guevara to be \\"the world symbol of the possibilities of one man\\",McLaren 2000, p. 3. while Black Power leader Stokely Carmichael eulogized that \\"Che Guevara is not dead, his ideas are with us.\\"Sinclair 1968/2006, p. 67. Praise has been reflected throughout the political spectrum, with libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard extolling Guevara as a \\"heroic figure\\" who \\"more than any man of our epoch or even of our century, was the living embodiment of the principle of revolution\\",\\"Ernesto Che Guevara R.I.P.\\" by Rothbard, Murray, Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought, Volume 3, Number 3 (Spring-Autumn 1967). while journalist Christopher Hitchens reminisced that \\"[Che's] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time, he was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do‚Äîfought and died for his beliefs.\\" Che's image has become a logo as recognizable as the Nike swoosh or golden arches. Conversely, Jacobo Machover, an exiled opposition author, dismisses all praise of Guevara and portrays him as a callous executioner.Behind Che Guevara's mask, the cold executioner Times Online, 16 September 2007. Exiled former Cuban prisoners have expressed similar opinions, among them Armando Valladares, who declared Guevara \\"a man full of hatred\\" who executed dozens without trial,\\"'Che' Spurs Debate, Del Toro Walkout\\", The Washington Times, 27 January 2009. and Carlos Alberto Montaner, who asserted that Guevara possessed \\"a Robespierre mentality\\", wherein cruelty against the revolution's enemies was a virtue.Short interview on Che Guevara with Carlos Alberto Montaner for the Freedom Collection √Ålvaro Vargas Llosa of The Independent Institute has hypothesized that Guevara's contemporary followers \\"delude themselves by clinging to a myth\\", describing Guevara as a \\"Marxist Puritan\\" who employed his rigid power to suppress dissent, while also operating as a \\"cold-blooded killing machine\\". Llosa also accuses Guevara's \\"fanatical disposition\\" as being the linchpin of the \\"Sovietization\\" of the Cuban revolution, speculating that he possessed a \\"total subordination of reality to blind ideological orthodoxy\\". On a macro-level, Hoover Institution research fellow William Ratliff regards Guevara more as a creation of his historical environment, referring to him as a \\"fearless\\" and \\"head-strong Messiah-like figure\\", who was the product of a martyr-enamored Latin American culture which \\"inclined people to seek out and follow paternalistic miracle workers\\".Che is the \\"Patron Saint\\" of Warfare by William Ratliff, The Independent Institute, 9 October 2007. Ratliff further speculates that the economic conditions in the region suited Guevara's commitment to \\"bring justice to the downtrodden by crushing centuries-old tyrannies\\"; describing Latin America as being plagued by what Mois√©s Na√≠m referred to as the \\"legendary malignancies\\" of inequality, poverty, dysfunctional politics and malfunctioning institutions. Brazilian President J√¢nio Quadros decorated Guevara with the Order of the Southern Cross in 1961.From the National Archives of Brazil. In a mixed assessment, British historian Hugh Thomas opined that Guevara was a \\"brave, sincere and determined man who was also obstinate, narrow, and dogmatic\\".Kellner 1989, p. 106. At the end of his life, according to Thomas, \\"he seems to have become convinced of the virtues of violence for its own sake\\", while \\"his influence over Castro for good or evil\\" grew after his death, as Fidel took up many of his views. Similarly, the Cuban-American sociologist Samuel Farber lauds Che Guevara as \\"an honest and committed revolutionary\\", but also criticizes the fact that \\"he never embraced socialism in its most democratic essence\\". Nevertheless, Guevara remains a national hero in Cuba, where his image adorns the 3 peso banknote and school children begin each morning by pledging \\"We will be like Che.\\"Che Guevara's Ideals Lose Ground in Cuba by Anthony Boadle, Reuters, 4 October 2007: \\"he is the poster boy of communist Cuba, held up as a selfless leader who set an example of voluntary work with his own sweat, pushing a wheelbarrow at a building site or cutting sugar cane in the fields with a machete.\\"People's Weekly 2004.

Due to the volatility of hard disks from their moving parts and low tolerances some sectors become defective. Defective sectors can even come on hard disks from the factory so most disks incorporate a bad-block recovery system to cope with these issues. Description During a low-level format, defect lists are populated which store which sectors are bad. The bad sectors are then mapped and a sector slipping algorithm is utilized. When using sector slipping for bad sectors, disk access time is not largely affected. The drive will just skip over the sectors and takes the same time as it would have to read the sector. Spare sectors are located on the disk to aid in having sectors to ‚Äúslip‚Äù other sectors down to, allowing for the preservation of sequential ordering of the data. Accuracy of programs reliant on static knowledge of cylinders and block positions will be compromised though. Bad sectors that are found during normal usage of the disk are not capable of having the sector slipping algorithm applied. Instead a linear reallocation, or sector forwarding, is used where a bad sector is replaced with a sector from a spare area. Doing this does affect access times as the disk will need to seek to the spare sector since all further lookups of the bad sector will redirect to the new sector. Example Logical Sectors Physical Sectors Pre Low-Level Format 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 7 Logical Sectors Physical Sectors Post Low-Level Format 0 -------> 0 1 -------> 1 2 -------> 2 3 (Bad) 3 -------> 4 5 (Bad) 4 -------> 6 5 -------> 7 In this example, physical sectors 3 and 5 were found to be bad. The sectors were then slipped down to allow for the logical sectors to be placed in sequential order on good sectors. Sector 3 was slipped down to 4 and sector 4 was slipped down to 6. The rest of the sectors were slipped down to the remaining spare sectors: Sector 4 to 6 and sector 5 to 7.

On June 21, 1996, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Porter Military Academy. The arsenal was constructed in 1841 near the intersection of Ashley Avenue and Mill Street in Charleston. It served as a storage place for weapons, ordnance, and ammunition for the U.S. Army in antebellum days. (An earlier Federal arsenal, the Old Citadel, was taken out of service and after became a part of The Citadel.) The Charleston arsenal produced a considerable amount of artillery and small arms ammunition during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and up to the Civil War. With the secession of South Carolina in December 1860, the Arsenal became a target for Charleston militia. South Carolina troops seized the arsenal in late December, and the Confederates held it for much of the war. Josiah Gorgas had the arsenal enlarged and modernized with the installation of steam power. For a time, it was used a barracks to house Confederate troops, including the 26th South Carolina. The arsenal was finally retaken by Union troops in 1865 when Charleston finally fell. On July 16, 1866, the U.S. government designated the site as a Federal Military Reservation, but in 1879 the Army closed the arsenal. The building and land were sold in 1888, to the Porter Military Academy which occupied the site until it built a new campus west of the Ashley River, and in 1963 the site became part of the Medical University of South Carolina. Waring Historical Library The building now houses the Waring Historical Library, the special collections and rare book library for the Medical University of South Carolina. The collections include books, journals, manuscript items and museum artifacts about the history of the health sciences. The library is open for visitors by appointment.

Those who support the union are referred to as \\"Unionists\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/home_rule_movement_01.shtml British unionism is closely associated with British nationalism, which asserts that the British are a nation and promotes the cultural unity of Britons,Guntram H.

Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2008.in a definition of Britishness that may include people of English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish descent (those living in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain and historically the whole of Ireland when it was within the United Kingdom). In the lead up to the American War of Independence in the second half of the 18th century, there existed British loyalists and colonial rebels (Whigs or Patriots). None of the Loyalists wanted separation. Not even a majority amongst the Rebels necessarily desired to be separate from Great Britain. Later, towards the end of the 19th century, Irish Unionism was by and large a reaction to an increase in separatist Irish nationalist agitation or self governance in Home Rule. Most of Ireland became separated from the UK in the 1920s. In Northern Ireland the polarised constitutional ideologies of republicans and loyalists has led to violent conflict, known as the Troubles. Since the late 20th century differing views on the constitutional status of the countries within the UK has become a bigger issue in Scotland and Wales. Following the Scottish National Party's victory in Scotland's 2011 election, a referendum on Scottish independence took place on 18 September 2014: the result supported remaining within the United Kingdom, winning the vote by 55.3% No to 44.7% Yes to the question \\"Should Scotland be an independent country?\\". Formation of the Union The Kingdom of Great Britain was formed on 1 May 1707 through the Acts of Union 1707, two simultaneous acts passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland. These created a political union between the Kingdom of England (consisting of England and Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland. This event was the result of the Treaty of Union that was agreed on 22 July 1706. The Acts created a single Parliament of Great Britain at Westminster as well as a customs and monetary union. However, England and Scotland remained separate legal jurisdictions. In 1801, the Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland, through two similar independent acts of the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland. This created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on a similar basis to how England and Scotland had been united a century earlier. A campaign to repeal the Union in Ireland began immediately. A series of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th century to establish Home Rule for Ireland within the union were unsuccessful and, following the Anglo-Irish War and subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922, most of Ireland left the union as the Irish Free State. Northern Ireland remained part of the union and the United Kingdom became known formally as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 (see: Partition of Ireland). Prior to the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain, the three kingdoms had been separate states in personal union. When James VI of Scotland succeeded his cousin, Elizabeth I of England, as king of England, the crowns of England, Ireland and Scotland were united. Before then, in 1542, the crowns of England and Ireland had been united through the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland under the Crown of Ireland Act 1542. Since the 12th century, the King of England had acted as Lord of Ireland, under papal overlordship. The act of 1542 created the title of King of Ireland for King Henry VIII of England and his successors, removing the role of the Pope as ultimate overlord of Ireland. Support for the Union Support for the Union was historically highest in England and lowest in Ireland, with significant anti-Union movements in Scotland and Wales. Today, polls consistently show that a majority of people in England and Wales support the continuation of the Union, however in Scotland support for independence has regularly polled higher than support for the union.Opinion polling on Scottish independence Since the widespread devolution of the late 1990s, the electorate of Scotland and Wales had been more likely to vote for nationalist political parties for local or regional elections than in general elections for the House of Commons, where support for the UK-wide parties dominated. However, for Scotland, after the 2015 United Kingdom general election this is no longer the case with the SNP returning 56 and out of 59 MPs. In England, English nationalist parties have never won a seat in Parliament. In 2014, the extent of UK-wide support for the Union came under considerable investigation as a result of the prospect of Scottish independence. The final result of the referendum saw a majority of Scottish voters electing to remain in the Union, with 55.3% voting against independence.BBC News, 'Scotland Decides' (September 2014) https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides Polls conducted in 2014 found that 70% of voters in England opposed Scottish independence,Populus poll for the Daily Mail, reported on Georgia Newsday (09/12/2014) as did 83% of the Welsh population.Sky News, Scot Vote Boosts Welsh Independence Support (15 September 2014) http://news.sky.com/story/1336172/scot-vote-boosts-welsh- independence-support The Scottish referendum prompted an increase in political activity and vocalism across the United Kingdom.

Independence was leading over Union support in most polls for each month of 2020 up to July. On 6th July 2020, Professor Sir John Curtice stated that \\"support for the Union [in Scotland] has never been weaker\\". https://www.thenational.scot/news/18562858.john-curtice-support-union-never- weaker/ In Northern Ireland, support for the Union has been found to increase since the end of The Troubles, especially within the Roman Catholic population.BBC News, 'Do more Northern Ireland Catholics now support the Union?' (29 November 2012) https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern- ireland-20547143 In part, this is as a result of a decreasing association of the Union with radical or extremist political ideologies following the Good Friday Agreement.

New Barkerville was formed in 1958, when the last remaining Barkerville residents were offered the choice of selling their homes to the Government of British Columbia, which had taken over the Barkerville townsite as a museum, or to be relocated. Most residents chose to have their houses relocated to the peak of the Reduction Road Hill, in the forest from Barkerville. Today, New Barkerville consists of roughly eight updated pioneer- style family houses and outbuildings, with a few newly built homes interspersed between them. Amenities are basic - Hydro electricity, spring-fed water supply, telephone and satellite high speed internet are recent innovations - but the solitude and natural surroundings appeal to the year- round residents, who participate fully in the life of nearby Wells, away. The architecture of New Barkerville's heritage houses is typical of the 1930s gold-rush era, with square dimensions, narrow, short staircases, small rooms clustered around a central wood stove and compact, efficient kitchens. Some houses still maintain wood stoves for everyday cooking as well as for heat. In most cases, the original hardwood floors and hand-carved support poles are still in existence. As in Wells, a couple of New Barkerville houses are painted in bright colourbox shades. Within a short walk of New Barkerville are walking trails, the Government Hill and Lowhee campsites, Barkerville cemetery, and Barkerville Historic Town.

She was married to Aaron Burr and their divorce was finalized on the day of his death. Although she was born into poverty, an advantageous marriage to a wealthy merchant made her one of the richest women in New York at the time of her death. Early life Eliza Jumel was born Elizabeth Bowen in Providence, Rhode Island, on April 2, 1775 (she would later joke \\"that she had come near being an April fool\\"). She had two older siblings, John (born 1769) and Mary, called Polly (born 1772). Eliza's mother, Phebe Kelley Bowen, worked from a young age as an indentured servant. Her father, John Bowen, was a sailor. By the time Eliza was seven years old, she and her mother were living in a brothel along with five other women. Because their parents were unable to support them, Betsy and her sister Polly were living in a workhouse in 1784.Oppenheimer, p. 8 However, a year later, the sisters were again living with their mother, in the house of Patience Ingraham, a widow who had previously been cited for \\"keeping a house of bad fame\\". Both Phebe Bowen and the widow Ingraham were arrested in 1785 \\"for keeping a disorderly house\\", and Betsy and her sister were again thrown in the workhouse.Oppenheimer, p. 9-10 From there she was indentured to a sea captain and his family. Eliza's father died in 1786, when she was eleven. Her mother remarried in 1790 to an itinerant cobbler named Jonathan Clark, and together they moved from town to town throughout New England, and then finally to Williamston, North Carolina. There they both succumbed to yellow fever in 1798, victims of an epidemic that may have also taken the life of Betsy's older brother.Oppenheimer, pp. 14-16 After her parents' deaths, the ambitious young Eliza moved to New York, and changed her name to Eliza Brown.Oppenheimer, p. 29 There she became an extra in the local theater, and during her early years in the city, she may have also found work as a domestic servant.Oppenheimer, p. 31-32 Eliza's sister later joined her in New York, and changed her name to Maria Bowne; Bowne married William Jones in 1805 and gave birth to a daughter three years later. Bowne named the girl Eliza Jumel Jones in honor of her sister.Oppenheimer, p. 43  Marriage to Stephen Jumel  Possibly through her performing career, or the proximity of their addresses in New York, Eliza met and later married the wealthy French-Haitian merchant Stephen Jumel in 1804. Stephen and Eliza may have found a common bond in their humble origins and ambitious nature: born √ätienne Jumel in France in 1765, Eliza's future husband grew up in a merchant family, emigrating to the American Colonies on the eve of the French Revolution and, like Eliza, changing his name to better fit his new life.Oppenheimer, p. 17-25 The newly rechristened Stephen Jumel married Eliza Brown on April 9, 1804.Oppenheimer, p. 35 A rumor circulated that Eliza had been Stephen's mistress, and he had only married her on his deathbed when she became convinced that \\"'she c[oul]d not die in peace until she was lawfully married.\\" Though certainly false, its existence and persistence both highlight the unconventional nature of the marriage and Eliza's unstable place in New York's merchant class. Due to both her humble background and career on the stage, Eliza was seen as a suspicious figure at a prosperous merchant's side. In 1807 Eliza became an Episcopalian, her baptism taking place at Trinity Church in Manhattan.Oppenheimer, p. 42 This was notable both because her chosen religion was not that of her husband (Stephen was a lifelong Catholic), and because it was the religion of America's political class at the time. Though she and her husband had no children of their own, they took in Mary Jones, the eldest and illegitimate daughter of her sister Polly (now called Maria), who was thus rechristened \\"Miss Jumel\\" and lived with the couple as their daughter.Oppenheimer, p. 43-44 In 1810, Stephen and Eliza moved to what became known as the Morris-Jumel Mansion in northern Manhattan, turning the historic home into their summer villa. Built in 1765 by Colonel Roger Morris for himself and his wife Mary Philipse the daughter of Frederick Philipse, the house then became George Washington's headquarters for several months in 1776 after the Morrises, who were Tory sympathizers, had fled back to England. Though it was from these headquarters that General Washington won his first victory of the war, the Battle of Harlem Heights, he and his troops soon moved on and the mansion was taken over by Hessian soldiers, then confiscated after the war came to an end.  Time in Paris  In 1815, Eliza and Stephen traveled to Paris, where they were linked to Bonapartist sympathizers. Eliza owned several relics from Josephine Bonaparte's extended family and claimed a close relationship with Bonaparte. It is now believed, however, that Stephen and Eliza had only a distant acquaintance with the Bonapartes, and that they bought most of the Napoleonic items at auction in Paris. Eliza had taken lessons with a French tutor during her courtship with Stephen, and she and Stephen easily conversed in both French and English (though Eliza never became totally fluent). Despite later accounts of an acrimonious marriage, their personal letters show them to have been an affectionate couple throughout their union, although letters on both sides were occasionally marked by fears of abandonment. Either illness or controversial political opinions lead to Eliza leaving France in 1816. Eliza returned to her home in New York, while Stephen Jumel remained in France. Stephen saw his fortunes decline during a series of economic depressions, leading to the collapse of his merchant trade in Paris. Eliza, however, managed their American estate and holdings with a good business acumen, and proved an astute investor. She made herself unpopular as a businesswoman in New York, however. Several of Stephen's business acquaintances were dishonest with his finances during the Jumel's absence, and it became Eliza's task to both make accusations and recoup money lost. Through her initiative, the couples' finances were saved from ruin. The couple continued to travel between New York, Paris, and Stephen's family home in Bordeaux. During these travels, Eliza amassed a large and respected art collection, often considered the first great collection of European art in North America.  Marriage to Aaron Burr  Aaron Burr Stephen Jumel died in 1832 of pneumonia at the age of 67. Fourteen months after Stephen's death, the 58-year-old Eliza Jumel married the controversial former United States Vice President Aaron Burr. She may have married Burr to increase her stature, while Burr may have wanted access to her fortune. Burr mismanaged the liquid assets remaining in the Jumel fortune, and the two separated only four months after their marriage. Eliza's prudence in real estate management, however, allowed her to remain financially solvent. Their divorce was finalized on September 14, 1836, the date of Burr's death. She was represented by Alexander Hamilton, Jr., the son of Alexander Hamilton.  Later life  Eliza Jumel continued to travel throughout Europe and to the summer retreats of New York for twenty years. In 1842, an encounter with Anne Northup, a famous chef and wife of the kidnapped, enslaved black musician, Solomon Northup, led to Anne and her three children living at Eliza's Manhattan mansion in 1842-1843. In her last significant travels, Eliza accompanied her two adopted grandchildren on a Grand Tour of Europe in 1856, during which time a large, life-size oil portrait of the three was executed by Alcide Ercole. As symptoms of dementia took their toll on Eliza's memory and behavior, stories about her eccentricity spread through New York and Saratoga Springs. Apocryphal stories from the 1880s suggests that Eliza may have become a regular target of mockery in Saratoga Springs. Eliza remained at her Manhattan mansion for the last six years of her life, dying there at age 90 in 1865. She was buried in Manhattan at the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum. Her life (1775‚Äì1865) spanned from the first year of the American Revolution to the last year of the Civil War.  Controversy regarding estate  A seventeen-year struggle over Eliza's estate after her death led to the invention of discrediting stories about her character. Many of the legends surrounding Eliza's early life, including the story that Eliza had been a child prostitute with her mother in a Providence brothel, where she gave birth to an illegitimate son, as well as the story that she had murdered Stephen Jumel, first appear in questionable depositions from these trials. Eliza did embellish her own life story in old age, however, making personal reinvention difficult to distinguish from malicious fiction. Over time, Eliza's colorful exaggerations were confused with negative character stories, forming a legendary narrative of her life that has proved far more enduring and dramatic than the more prosaic reality of her life as an ambitious and highly intelligent, but also personally insecure, businesswoman.

They are frequently made of paperboard with an aluminum foil lining, but variations exist. Juice boxes are most popular with children, although other uses include emergency drinking water, milk and wine. Ruben Rausing first created a product in 1963 that consisted of a box that would be used for containing liquids, more specifically, milk. His creation was named the Tetra Brik, and gained popularity because the product was efficient and a major space saver compared to the canisters that were previously used. The juice box was officially incorporated in the U.S. market in 1980. After its introduction, the product gained almost instant popularity and the market began to grow at a fast rate. According to an article on the website E notes, in 1986, only six years after the product's introduction, juice boxes accounted for 20% of the United States juice market, as more and more companies were introducing their own lines of juice boxes. In 1989, environmentalists raised concerns that the multi-layered design of juice boxes made them difficult to recycle or reuse.  Packaging and marketing  Grandi juice by Valio A juice box is made of liquid packaging board which is usually six layers of paper, polyethylene, and aluminum foil. Paper is used to shape the product and give the box an extra source of strength, Polyethylene forms a liquid-tight seal and keeps the product dry, polyethylene is the layer used to print the information and graphics that are provided on the packaging, aluminum is used for the purpose of keeping light and oxygen out (as well preventing the juice from becoming spoiled without having to use extra preservatives). One of the reasons as to why juice boxes are so popular is their convenience. Juice boxes are portable and can be easily drunk while on- the-go. The shape of the product makes it easy for kids and adults to hold and use. Juice boxes were originally designed in a very specific fashion, a style that has proved to be successful as it has remained, for the most part, unchanged. Manufacturers chose a box shape because they foresaw this shape as being the most convenient and easily handled. Juice boxes typically come with a covered hole and an attached bendable straw, which was introduced by Lynn Tilley, one of the designers who worked on porting it to America, after there were complaints about it being hard to drink from. These bendable straws make it easier for children to drink and generally results in less of a mess, and the bending nature of the straw helps it not fall into the box. However, there are some juice boxes available for purchase that are equipped with a pull tab; this variation of the juice box is ideal for larger portions that are not consumed in one sitting because the tab is resealable.

Persona 3 is set in a fictional Japanese city in the year 2009. Due to past events, there is a hidden period between one day and the next known as the \\"Dark Hour\\", during which most people become unconscious (a state the game calls \\"Transmogrification\\", symbolized by normal people turning into floating coffins), and Shadows feed on the minds of those still aware of their surroundings. In addition, a large tower called Tartarus, filled with Shadows, rises out of the ground during the Dark Hour. SEES is composed of students attending Gekkoukan High School. The player names and controls the game's protagonist, who leads SEES in its exploration of Tartarus. Persona 3 mixes elements of role-playing and simulation games: during the day, the player attends school, and is able to spend time with other characters, forming relationships known as Social Links. These Social Links, when formed, have gameplay benefits, increasing the player's proficiency in battle. To combat Shadows, each member of SEES is capable of summoning a Persona, a being which is a manifestation of one's psyche. Persona-users summon their Personas by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head. Shigenori Soejima designed the world and cast of Persona 3. The members of SEES include Yukari Takeba, a popular girl; Junpei Iori, a class clown and the Protagonist's best friend; Akihiko Sanada, the captain of Gekkoukan's boxing team; Mitsuru Kirijo, Gekkoukan's student council president; Fuuka Yamagishi, a shy girl who takes on a support role in battle; Aigis, a female android designed to fight Shadows; Ken Amada, an elementary school student whose mother was killed by a Persona-user; Koromaru, a dog capable of summoning a Persona; and Shinjiro Aragaki, a returning member of SEES who had previously left the team. The group encounters other Persona-users who are working against their efforts to eradicate Shadows, Tartarus, and the Dark Hour. Atlus released an enhanced remake of Persona 3 entitled Persona 3: FES. The new game makes revisions to the original gameplay of Persona 3 (referred to as \\"The Journey\\"), and adds a new epilogue to the original story, entitled \\"The Answer\\". The Answer introduces a new character, Metis, an anti-Shadow weapon like Aigis. In 2009 Atlus released a PlayStation Portable remake of Persona 3 entitled Persona 3 Portable, which adds more characters, including appearances by characters from the successor to Persona 3, Persona 4, released in 2008. Several Persona 3 characters also went on to make appearances in 2012's Persona 4 Arena and 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, both set two years after the events of \\"The Answer\\".

All of the members of SEES are Persona-users, who live together in a specialized dorm. In the final events of the game, the group is re-designated as the . =Protagonist= The protagonist is the namable main player-controlled character of Persona 3. He is named in the film adaptation, Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight, and most of his appearances. Having moved into the dorm in the introduction of the game, he learns his ability to summon the Fool arcana Persona and the Death arcana Persona before he's later appointed the team's leader in combat. He is unique among his cohorts in that he has the ability to carry multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains of The Judgement Arcana and of The Fool Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of the Wild Card he has access to over 150 different Personas. He is also the only character with access to the Velvet Room, in which the player is able to fuse together multiple Personas together to create a new, more powerful one. Over the course of the game, the player is challenged to manage his day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages him to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. Within the simulation elements of Persona 3, the player is able to form Social Links with characters in-game, each represented by one of the Major Arcana and granting various bonuses during Persona fusion, increasing the player's proficiency in battle. Soejima took longer to design him than any other character, as the game's other characters would be made to complement his design. Soejima wrote in Art of Persona 3, \\"Initially, he looked more honest, like an ordinary, handsome young man. But, I worked to achieve greater ambiguity in his expression.\\" He is voiced by Akira Ishida in the Japanese version of Persona 3 and Yuri Lowenthal in the English version. In Persona 3 Portable, released on the PlayStation Portable in 2009, an option was added to control a female protagonist, voiced by Marina Inoue in Japanese and Laura Bailey in English. Unlike the male protagonist, the female protagonist (usually called amongst fans) through her dialogue opinions, is shown to be a very upbeat and energetic person, sometimes pulling jokes on her friends, so they could be considered opposites. Later games explain that the two protagonists exist within different timelines. In the manga adaptation of Persona 3, he is portrayed as a quiet teenager who often tired or drowsy, who likes to eat and cook food. In the animated movie adaptation, he is portrayed as an ambivalent individual with an initially neutral viewpoint on the film's themes of life and death, making his growth via newfound experiences the focus of the movie. He also gains his new Personas from battles of against Arcana Shadows during full moon, instead of Social Links. In the stage adaptation, Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade, the male protagonist is named and he is portrayed by Shouta Aoi, while the female version is named and she is portrayed by Kana Asumi. =Yukari Takeba= :Voiced by (English): Michelle Ruff Voiced by (Japanese): Megumi Toyoguchi is one of the protagonist's classmates. She wields a bow and arrows in battle as well as Wind elemental magic. Yukari's zeal for investigation brings SEES a lot of trouble, but also gains the group valuable allies and information. Her Personas are and of The Lovers Arcana. Yukari is popular at school because of her good looks, cheerful disposition, and energetic attitude. Though outwardly friendly and extroverted, she is very careful not to let anyone get truly close to her. She constantly picks on Junpei, hides her true motives from the group, and represses a lot of anger and sorrow about her past. It is revealed that Yukari has been on her own for quite some time. Her father died a mysterious death a decade ago, in 1999, and her mother neglects her in favor of a string of shallow boyfriends. She slowly begins to open up to the protagonist because he is an orphan (having lost both of his parents in the same incident) and can understand her isolation. Midway through the game, Yukari discovers that her father was involved in the incident that unleashed the Shadows upon the world. Yukari is forced to face her anger and overcome it, and decides to fight for her friends and her father's memory. In the Social Link, which represents a choice for the protagonist's journey, the Protagonist helps Yukari mend her relationship with her mother. If the protagonist makes the correct choices, Yukari will fall in love with him. If the player chooses not to date any girls, Yukari will appear for all the dating events. In Persona 3: FES's The Answer, Yukari is the group member who is most reluctant to go back into battle against the Shadows and seems that she only wants to move on with her life. However, she fell in love with the protagonist, and as such, is bitter and jealous towards Aigis, who was not only able to spend the last moment with the protagonist before his death, but also inherited his powers. As such, Yukari constantly shows random mood swings towards her. After witnessing the protagonist's sacrifice and the burden he must carry, she finally overcomes her jealousy, apologizing to Aigis and offer her to become her roommate.

After the end of Persona 3, Yukari decided to put herself through college working as a model, and her proficiency with a bow landed her the television role as , otherwise known as , on Phoenix Ranger Featherman Victory. While filming on location, a real helicopter appears with Mitsuru coming out of it, asking Yukari for her help in a new emergency. Within the events of the game, her Persona is Isis.

Junpei becomes a member of SEES near the beginning of the game. Akihiko finds him crying in a convenience store during the Dark Hour, and does not realize that he has the potential to call a Persona until Akihiko tells him about it. His first Persona is and later obtains , both of The Magician Arcana. His decision to join SEES is a swift one, and Yukari is dismayed when he immediately moves into their dorm. Initially, Junpei fights because \\"playing hero\\" makes him feel like less of a loser. He uses his place in SEES to prop up his low self-esteem, neglects his classwork, and snaps at the protagonist out of jealousy over his unique Persona abilities. Junpei only becomes more serious after he meets Strega member Chidori. They fall for each other, and though she continues to fight SEES, her feelings for Junpei eventually come into conflict with her loyalty to Takaya and her fear of death. When Takaya fatally attacks Junpei, Chidori uses her Persona powers to save his life at the cost of her own. Junpei becomes a more-focused and determined young man after Chidori's death. In Persona 3 Portable, Junpei becomes the Social Link for the , representing action, initiative, and immaturity, when the player controls the female protagonist.

Her Personas are and of The Empress Arcana. Mitsuru has been battling Shadows since she was a little girl, as the unofficial leader of SEES. At the beginning of the game she avoids battle and acts as a support character, offering analysis and advice. She joins the party in combat only after the discovery of Fuuka Yamagishi, whose Persona's analysis power is much stronger. Throughout the story, Mitsuru hides many details about Tartarus and the Dark Hour from the group, due to feelings of guilt over her family's involvement in the accident that created them. Since her grandfather was responsible for everything, she believes that she alone bears the burden of setting the world right. Her Persona was artificially induced to allow her to participate in the battle against the Shadows. Mitsuru is the only SEES member that had her ability to summon a Persona forced on her. Mitsuru loses all will to fight after Ikutsuki kills her father, since restoring the family honor is meaningless without a family. She regains her resolve thanks to some intervention from Yukari. She decides to take over leadership of the Kirijo Group after the conflict with Nyx is finished and she graduates high school. In the Social Link, representing life brought forth from motherhood, the protagonist will help free her from some of the expectations attached to her family name.

His Personas are and of The Emperor Arcana. He cannot fight for the first part of the game, due to injuries received during the Dark Hour. Akihiko was one of the three Persona users who founded SEES, alongside Mitsuru and Shinjiro. He and Shinjiro were close friends as children, having grown up in an orphanage together with Akihiko's now-deceased sister Miki. However, one night when the two were chasing down a Shadow, Shinjiro's Persona went out of control and an innocent bystander was killed: Ken Amada's mother. After the incident, Shinjiro left SEES and his friendship with Akihiko became strained. The two only reconnect when Ken joins SEES, and Akihiko convinces Shinjiro to rejoin the group in order to protect him. When Akihiko realizes that Ken only volunteered for SEES as a means to get revenge on Shinjiro, he tries to save both of them from making grave mistakes, but he arrives too late. Though Ken lets go of his vendetta, Shinjiro is fatally shot while protecting him from Takaya. In the end, Shinjiro's way of facing death head on gave Akihiko the courage to carry on in spite of all his losses. Akihiko is determined that Shinjiro's death not be in vain and to be just as fearless in the face of his own mortality. In Persona 3: FES, a door which shows Akihiko's past reveals why the Evoker looks like a handgun.

She is found to be a Persona-user by Akihiko, although he suspects that she would be unable to fight. Her meekness makes her the target of bullying by several female students. In May, one of her bullies is found outside of the front of the school gate, unconscious. A rumor begins to spread that she was attacked by a ghost inside Gekkoukan. SEES later learns from Natsuki Moriyama that she and her friends‚Äîthe students responsible for bullying her‚Äîhad locked Fuuka in the school gymnasium; the same day, they returned to let her out for fear that she would commit suicide, but found no one inside. Mitsuru realizes that Fuuka has been trapped inside Tartarus, which replaces Gekkoukan during the Dark Hour. The team locates her inside the tower the following night - during a full moon - and finds that she had been able to avoid detection by Shadows. The same night during the Dark Hour, SEES encounters two powerful Shadows at the entrance of Tartarus. Fuuka is able to summon her Persona for the first time, and finds that she can detect the weaknesses of the enemies. The ordeal causes her to fall unconscious for several days, after which Fuuka accepts Mitsuru's offer to join SEES, and moves into the dorm with the rest of the team. She replaces Mitsuru as the player's support character, and Mitsuru becomes an active combatant in battle. In June, Yukari asks her to research an incident related to Gekkoukan which occurred ten years ago, as she believes Mitsuru is hiding something about the origins of Tartarus, as well as her father's death. Her Personas are and of The Priestess Arcana. In the Social Link, representing contemplation and inner knowledge, the protagonist helps Fuuka become more confident and believe in herself. She appears in Persona 4 Arena as a non- playable character in the game's story and as an optional commentator. Soejima, in his designing Fuuka, tried to make her not seem weak or helpless.

Aigis is introduced during SEES' summer beach vacation, where she is simultaneously the target of Mitsuru's retrieval mission and Junpei's \\"Operation Babe Hunt.\\" She immediately shows an instinctual interest in protecting the protagonist, which she cannot explain. Ikutsuki decides to make her a member of SEES and she later enrolls at Gekkoukan High School. When Ryoji Mochizuki transfers to Gekkoukan High, she immediately acts hostile towards him and warns the protagonist that Ryoji is dangerous. Aigis realizes why she feels such hostility toward Ryoji and hunts him down one night, during a full moon, where she confronts him on Moonlight Bridge. Ten years ago Aigis' mission was to defeat Death and avert the arrival of Nyx. During the battle at that very location on Moonlight Bridge, she realized Death could not be defeated and decided to seal the entity away in a young boy who was the sole survivor of a nearby car crash. That young boy was the protagonist and is the reason behind her instincts to protect him. Her explanation triggers Ryoji's memories and he finally realizes that he is, in fact, the incarnation of Death. In an attempt to fulfill her purpose, Aigis attacks Ryoji, but he easily defends himself, heavily damaging her in the process. The Kirijo Group are able to repair Aigis and when she returns, she begins to shows more human-like qualities and emotions. She decides to stand against the power of Nyx with her friends in SEES. After defeating Nyx, she is the only one who remembers Tartarus, the Dark Hour, and the protagonist's sacrifice during his borrowed month of life after the defeat of Nyx. She allows him to live like a normal student for the few precious weeks that he has. Finally, on Graduation Day, as she is holding the protagonist in her lap, she suddenly realizes what it means to be human and also the true purpose in her existence is to protect the life of the protagonist.

Using Athena as her Persona, Aigis joins Mitsuru and Akihiko in their search of another Anti-Shadow weapon, Labrys, that was stolen from Mitsuru. Also, in Elizabeth's story mode, she, along with her successor and fellow Wild Card wielder Yu Narukami, help Elizabeth understand the true nature of the Wild Card. Aigis was created to remind people of the robots being used in manga, even though Shigenori Soejima admits that he didn't want to create her since a robot like her does not exist currently in the modern world. She is portrayed by ZAQ in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade and Kanon Miyahara in the Persona 4 Arena and the Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Song Project stage plays. =Shinjiro Aragaki= :Voiced by (English): Grant George Voiced by (Japanese): Kazuya Nakai (nicknamed Shinji) is a Senior at Gekkoukan High School and a former member of SEES. Two years prior, while the group was hunting a Shadow, he briefly lost control of his Persona, of The Hierophant Arcana, resulting in the death of Ken's mother. This prompted him to quit SEES. Shinjiro is a childhood friend of Akihiko, who continually asks him to forget the past and rejoin SEES. He continually refuses the offers, only returning to fight when he learns that Ken has joined the team as a Persona- user. When Shinjiro is lured by Ken behind Port Island Station to be killed, he accepts the death of Ken's mother as his fault, saying death is what he deserves. However, Shinjiro warns Ken that if he kills him, he will \\"end up like [Shinjiro] and will regret it.\\" Takaya, a member of Strega, intervenes and attempts to shoot Ken, instead hitting Shinjiro, who sacrifices himself to save Ken. Before he dies, he tells Ken and the rest of SEES, \\"This is how it should be\\". At his funeral, it is learned that Shinjiro rarely attended school and was generally not well known among the student body. During the final confrontation with Nyx, the protagonist hears Shinjiro's voice cheering him on along with the voices of the living SEES members saying \\"Alright, let's do this\\". In battle, Shinjiro attacks with blunt weapons. He is forced to regularly take special suppressant pills to properly control his Persona, at the cost of his health. Shinjiro represents the Social Link of the , representing a source of fear and false illusions, in Persona 3 Portable, if the player is controlling the female protagonist. At the end of the Social Link, the female protagonist finds Shinjiro's watch that he lost.

In a new cycle, he is discharged from the hospital on the final day of the game to be with the female protagonist. He is portrayed by Ray Fujita in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade. =Ken Amada= :Voiced by (English): Uncredited (Persona 3 (FES) and Persona 3 Portable), Cindy Robinson (Ultimax onwards) :Voiced by (Japanese): Megumi Ogata is an elementary school student capable of summoning a Persona, and the youngest of SEES. His Personas are and of The Justice Arcana. His mother was killed two years prior to the events of Persona 3 by a Persona-user, although the death was officially listed as an accident. He moves into the dorm in July, when it is discovered that he is a Persona-user, and later joins SEES as a fighter. In August, he learns that his mother was killed by Shinjiro Aragaki, a former member of SEES, who briefly lost control of his Persona. On October 4, during a full moon, Ken lures Shinjiro to an alley behind Port Island Station, intending to kill him and avenge his mother. However, Takaya, a member of the group Strega, intervenes, revealing that Shinjiro will soon die anyway due to his use of Persona-suppressant pills, and that Ken was planning to commit suicide after killing Shinjiro. Takaya resolves to kill both of them first, but Shinjiro blocks his second shot, saving Ken's life. Ken briefly runs from the dorm following the incident; after being encouraged by Akihiko, however, he gains the resolve to return to SEES, and his Persona changes form. In battle, Ken wields a spear. He chose this as his weapon because it would compensate for his lack of height, although his height makes the weapon more difficult for him to use. His Personas allow him to use Electricity and Light magic to compensate for how difficult a spear is to use for him. Ken is the Social Link for the in Persona 3 Portable, representing the knowledge of what is right and wrong, if the player is controlling the female protagonist. In the Japanese version of the game, the female protagonist has the option of pursuing a romantic relationship with Ken. Due to cultural differences, his Social Link is slightly edited in the English version in order to make Ken's feelings seem more like a crush with the female protagonist seeing him as a younger brother. Ken appears as a playable character in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, fighting alongside Koromaru. Now a teenager, Ken attends Gekkoukan Middle School, and is a member of both the Student Council and the soccer team.http://www.famitsu.com/news/201405/22053587.html In designing Ken, Soejima focused more on his appearance than his characteristics. He believes the shorts Ken wears give him a \\"nostalgic\\" look in contrast to the modern setting of Persona 3, noting in Art of Persona 3 that \\"kids these days hardly ever wear shorts.\\" Because the character's design is focused on the idea that he is a young boy, Soejima jokingly wrote Ken's name as \\"Kid Amada\\" on concept sketches. He is portrayed by Waku Sakaguchi and Tomonori Suzuki in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade. =Metis= :Voiced by (English): Stephanie Sheh :Voiced by (Japanese): Chiwa Saito is an android like Aigis, who refers to herself as Aigis' sister. She first appears during the events of The Answer in Persona 3 FES, when she attacks SEES using the Persona of The Hierophant Arcana. The player learns that the day March 31 has been repeating itself over and over, and that the characters are trapped inside the dorm. Metis attempts to kill the members of SEES to end the time loop and save her sister, but is subdued by Aigis. When the player's characters discover the Abyss of Time, an expansive area underneath the dorm connected to the time loop, she joins SEES to help investigate, becoming a character under the control of the player. Aigis later learns that Metis awoke in the Abyss with no memory of her past, and only the knowledge that she had a sister who was in danger. At the conclusion of The Answer, SEES learns that Metis is actually a facet of Aigis' personality, representative of Aigis' humanity, which she had rejected out of despair after the death of the protagonist. Antagonists =Strega= The members of Strega. From left to right: Jin Shirato, Takaya Sakaki and Chidori Yoshino. Strega is a group of three rogue Persona-users who use the Dark Hour for personal benefit. They set up an internet site called \\"Revenge Request\\", where users can contract Strega to commit assassinations and other illegal activities. They become enemies of SEES because SEES is trying to put an end to the Dark Hour, as Strega carries out its activities during the Dark Hour. Near the end of the game, the player discovers that Strega are artificial Persona users created by the Kirijo Group. They were picked up off the street and used as fodder for the corporation's experiments. Because their Personas were not awakened naturally, they must take Persona Suppressants supplied by Ikutsuki, drugs that keep Personas from killing their users, but have lethal side-effects. It is revealed in Persona 3: FES that some of the artificial Persona users turned into Shadows. Takaya Sakaki :Voiced by (English): Derek Stephen Prince Voiced by (Japanese): Nobutoshi Canna is the confident and charismatic young leader of Strega. He functions as the main antagonist of the game, leading the rival group of Persona-users and setting himself up as a false messiah. In battle, Takaya uses a six-shot revolver to strike down his opponents. Aside from Aigis, he is the only Persona-user in the game who does not use an Evoker to manifest his Persona, instead summoning it \\"manually\\" by clutching his head and falling to his knees. Persona-users in previous games also did not use Evokers, but summoning their Personas never appeared to cause them any pain. His Persona is of The Fortune arcana. Since Takaya does not have long to live, he lives fully for the moment, heedless of the harm he causes others. His dearest wish is to see the world end along with his own life. Though he does have some care for Jin and Chidori, he has no qualms about using either of them as tools. At first, he tries to prevent SEES from killing the twelve Arcana Shadows, since it'll end his Revenge Request website business and his 'powers', and as if he is trying to save the world in his own way. But he embraces death once he realizes their true purpose. Near the end of the game he creates a cult centered around the coming of Nyx as a salvation, with himself as the high priest and Jin spreading rumors around the network. Takaya's final defeat occurs when he tries to forcibly stop SEES from climbing Tartarus and facing Nyx. Afterwards he crawls to the top of the tower to witness the final battle. Before he falls unconscious he calls Jin's name, making his last statement, that he did not want to see the end without him. He is portrayed by Takeya Nishiyama in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade. Jin Shirato :Voiced by (English): Grant George Voiced by (Japanese): Masaya Onosaka is Takaya's faithful right-hand man, acting as his tactical adviser, the webmaster of \\"Revenge Request,\\" and the occasional voice of reason to prevent Takaya from making foolish choices. He uses grenades and bombs in battle and is also a skilled computer hacker. His Persona is of The Hermit arcana. Jin appears very eager to be rid of SEES, since he believes that they are hypocrites who do not appreciate their own power. Despite his strong belief in Takaya's goals, however, he is rational enough to limit his actions when necessary. He is fiercely loyal to Takaya for \\"showing him out of darkness\\" and helping him through the Kirijo Group's experiments. In spite of this, he often inadvertently helps SEES by revealing important information, such as the truth behind Strega, their involvement in the coming of Nyx, and Shuji Ikutsuki's real allegiance. After SEES defeats Jin near the end of the game, he commits suicide with a grenade as a horde of shadows swarm towards him. He is portrayed by Yuichi Matsumoto in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade. Chidori Yoshino :Voiced by: Miyuki Sawashiro is the third member of Strega, and is known for her gothic lolita dress style, self-harming tendencies, and artistic ability. In battle she utilizes a red chained hand-axe. Her Persona is of The Hanged Man arcana. She uses Medea's ability to radiate life energy to keep Strega from being detected by Fuuka's Persona. Like Takaya, she shows unusual Persona abilities, such as being able to heal living creatures (including her own wounds) and manifest Medea outside of the Dark Hour. Chidori and Junpei meet by chance at Port Island Station. While she is initially very unpleasant to Junpei because he keeps interrupting her sketching, she eventually opens up to him due to his kindness and persistence. At the same time, Junpei tells her everything about SEES without knowing that she is a member of Strega. Chidori is led to believe that Junpei is SEES' leader. During full moon of September, Chidori kidnaps Junpei, thinking that he has the authority to call off SEES' mission to kill the Arcana Shadows. When the plan fails, she is wounded and ends up held in the local hospital. Mitsuru and Akihiko try to interrogate her, but meet little success. Junpei continues to visit Chidori in the hospital, and the two become closer. He is very concerned about her habit of cutting her wrists. However, after faking his death, Takaya returns to remind her where she truly belongs. Ten days before the first full moon of December, Chidori is broken out of the hospital and rejoins Strega, but her loyalties begin to falter when she is forced to fight Junpei, and when he is wounded by Takaya, she comes to terms with her love for him. She sacrifices her life to save his through the use of her Persona, and ends up giving Junpei some of her Persona's regenerative power, namely the passive skill Spring of Life which restores HP every turn. This results in Junpei's Persona being reborn. After her death Junpei inherits her sketch-book, which turns out of have been full of pictures of him. In Persona 3: FES and Persona 3 Portable, it is possible that Chidori revives in the story. However, Chidori has no memories of the events in the game, including Junpei. She is revived when doctors take her corpse in for autopsy. For a tribute, they use the flowers she had in her room and placed them on her chest. Since Chidori constantly gave her life force to them every time Junpei came to visit her, her body took back its energy from the flowers and brought her back to life. It was hinted that Chidori had not completely lost all her memories, and that she had plans to find the person of her dreams as soon as she recovers. Chidori is confirmed alive in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax and Persona Q. Though she did not appear physically in the games, she was mentioned by Junpei several times during date cafe in PQ and while he was daydreaming of proposing to her, before waking up on the train in Arena Ultimax. When fighting against Shadows, Junpei said he wouldn't let Chidori worry about him again. Junpei is seen wearing a cross necklace in Arena Ultimax, which he mentions that it was given to him by her. She is portrayed by Yuri Hane in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade. =Shuji Ikutsuki= :Voiced by (English): Dan Woren :Voiced by (Japanese): Hideyuki Hori is the chairman of the board at Gekkoukan High School, and an adviser for SEES. He experiences the Dark Hour but does not have a Persona. He is known among the members of SEES for his silly jokes. He establishes a link between twelve greater Shadows that have been attacking the city, and the Dark Hour. He informs SEES that eliminating these twelve Shadows would eliminate the Dark Hour. However, after doing so, SEES learns that they were actually aiding in Ikutsuki's efforts to summon Nyx to Earth and bring about the end of the world. It is later revealed that ten years prior, Ikutsuki worked as a scientist at Kirijo's Ergo Research division, studying Shadows and performing various inhumane experiments while attempting to artificially induce Personas into individuals like Strega and Sho Minazuki, the latter of whom treated him as a father. When confronted, Ikutsuki reprograms Aigis and attempts to offer the members of SEES as sacrifices on a roof of Tartarus. However, his efforts are thwarted by Takeharu Kirijo, Mitsuru's father. The two simultaneously fire guns at each other, killing Takeharu and wounding Ikutsuki. When Aigis breaks free of her reprogramming, Ikutsuki jumps from Tartarus to his death. He is portrayed by Shoichi Honda in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade - The Blue Awakening, the Persona 4 Arena stage play, and the Persona 4 Ultimax Song Project stage play; and Mitsuru Karahashi in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade - The Ultramarine Labyrinth and Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade - The Bismuth Crystals. =Nyx= , also known as the \\"maternal being\\", is the mother of all Shadows and the final boss of Persona 3. She is drawn to humanity by The Appriser, and would bring about the end of the world if brought to Earth. At the conclusion of Persona 3, the protagonist is able to enter Nyx and becomes the Great Seal to keep it away from humanity, at the cost of his own life. In Persona 3 FES, during The Events of The Answer, Metis informs SEES that Nyx is not a malevolent being, and that a seal would ordinarily not be necessary. However, the Great Seal prevents humanity itself from calling out to Nyx through their own wishes for death. This accumulated malice of the human race manifested in a monster called Erebus, which is attempting to break the seal created by the protagonist. =Erebus= is the final boss of The Answer in Persona 3: FES. It is not an actual Shadow - rather, Erebus is a large monster created from the accumulated malice and despair from the human race; it is attempting to break the Great Seal the protagonist created to keep Nyx from returning to Earth. When SEES encounters Erebus, it targets Aigis, who bears the protagonist's \\"wild card\\" ability to carry multiple Personas. SEES is able to disperse it, thus breaking the time loop, although they suspect it will eventually reappear as humans continue to wish for death. Erebus reappears in Persona 4 Arena in Elizabeth's story mode, during which she destroys it, though estimates it will re-form within a year's time. Other characters =Igor= :Voiced by (English): Dan Woren Voiced by (Japanese): Isamu Tanonaka is the long-nosed man who presides over the Velvet Room and aides the player in Persona fusion. He appears in a similar capacity in every Persona game. Early on in Persona 3, he encourages the protagonist to form Social Links, saying they will determine his potential in combat. Near the conclusion of the game, when SEES is unable to stop Nyx's descent to Earth, Igor aids the protagonist in unveiling the power of the \\"Universe\\", using the power of the Social Links he has formed. The protagonist uses this newfound power to seal away Nyx. Despite the death of Isamu Tanonaka due to myocardial infarction in 2010, the animated movie adaptation in 2013 still uses his original voices recorded in the game.

In Persona 4, Elizabeth has left the Velvet Room, her role being filled by her sister, Margaret. She left to find a way to rescue the protagonist of Persona 3 from his fate as the seal between Nyx and humanity.

Ten years prior to the events of Persona 3, the two fought on the same bridge, and Aigis, unable to defeat Death, sealed it inside the protagonist, who was a child at the time. Ryoji informs SEES that his purpose is to summon Nyx to Earth, who will bring about the end of the world. He asserts that Nyx is impossible to defeat; however, he offers SEES an alternative. If they were to kill him, their memories of the Dark Hour would vanish, allowing them to continue living unaware of their impending death.

A Ganguro, she has an extremely tanned complexion, and orange-ish hair, similar in the style of most ganguro, or gyaru. She's shown to have a rather sadistic side, and has a knack for anyalzing people, and knowing exactly what to say to make them feel worthless. Fuuka, at first, was her target, because of Natsuki's own insecurities. She was drawn in by Fuuka's calls for help, and went into Tartarus. Fuuka saved her from a Shadow by summoning her Persona, which encased them in a protective shell inside of her. After the ordeal, Natsuki lost her memory of the event, but apologized to Fuuka. The two quickly became best friends, and Natsuki's attitude proved a positive influence on Fuuka, making her a more confident girl. Natsuki's father became ill, and her family didn't have enough money, so they were forced to move. Natsuki then revealed that she and Fuuka were more similar than they thought, because Natsuki's parents both didn't pay much attention to her, claiming that they acted like she didn't even exist. She provided Fuuka with the resolve to earn her ascendant Persona, sending a text message to Fuuka saying that \\"No matter how far apart we may be, we will always be connected\\", which gave Fuuka her resolve. She also provided Fuuka another set of advice, claiming that \\"If they don't accept you for who you are, then screw 'em.\\" Throughout the game, Natsuki is the closest person to Fuuka, despite their differences. Natsuki also claimed that \\"I like you, even if you don't like yourself.\\" =Zen and Rei= :Voiced by (English): Keith Silverstein (Zen), Ashly Burch (Rei) Voiced by (Japanese): Yuki Kaji (Zen), Kaori Nazuka (Rei) Zen and Rei are amnesiacs encountered in Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth: they are residents of a mysterious haven in the rift which takes the shape of Yasogami High (part of the setting for Persona 4), and due to story events do not appear in any other Persona title involving the members of SEES or the Investigation Team. Zen is a taciturn young man who is unfamiliar with people's habits and has a tendency to take things too literally, but is otherwise devoted to Rei's well-being, while Rei is a cheerful and innocent girl who has a strange metabolism that causes her to be forever hungry. Depending on which protagonist was chosen at the start, either SEES or the Investigation Team will encounter them first. If the Persona 3 protagonist is chosen, then Fuuka locates the first labyrinth somewhere near where the team is gathered by picking up on Shadow signals. However, before they can enter, Zen and Rei appear and interrupt them. Since they intend to enter a maze which doubles as a Shadows' nest, the protagonist allows them to join SEES for the time being. When they meet the Investigation Team, SEES decides to attempt to restore Zen and Rei's memories as this is their only lead to a way out of the haven in the rift. Zen is later revealed to be a part of Chronos, a being presiding over death, who was sent to take a young girl named Niko who had died of illness to \\"where all life returns\\". At this stage, Rei is abducted and the school's clock tower undergoes a Tartarus-esque transformation, and although Zen at first decides to save her on his own, SEES and the Investigation Team resolve to stay and help him out. Zen uses a crossbow in battle. With this, he can shoot various objects at enemies, such as arrows or bullets. Unlike the other members of SEES, neither he nor Rei possess or are able to use Personas: however, they are capable of fighting Shadows by using an array of battle abilities unique to them. When Rei is kidnapped, Zen starts using the abilities she was using until then. =Hikari= :Voiced by: Misato Fukuen is a character introduced in Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth. She is a teenage girl that one day woke up in the movie theater, she is the last person to enter the cinema. At first, she is very shy and quiet, and will have difficulties speaking to anyone that isn't Nagi, another resident of the theater. Her shyness is due to the drauma and depression of her bad past: she was often bullied and made fun of by others for being different, although due to psychogenic amnesia she can't properly remember her past during the game. Unable to cope with the pain of living, she ended up in the Cinema in the collective unconsciousness during a dream, there she meets Nagi, who promesses Hikari to protect her from any harm by isolating her from reality. As our heroes change the endings of the movies, Hikari slowly starts to open up and begins communicating with them, and later in the game. After finishing the third labyrinth, Hikari followes Doe to one of the movies, titled ???, where she faces all of her past traumas, causing her to fully remember her memories and forcing her into a change of heart, revealing the title of the movie being named after her, \\"Hikari\\". After facing her past memories with courage and accepting them, Hikari successfully rehabilitates from her depression and acts as a combat support.

She congratulates our heroes every time they clear a labyrinth, even claiming that she doesn't have a choice. However, near the end of the game, she drops off her guise and reveals herself as Enlil, an administrator of the collective unconsciousness with a delusional and patronizing view towards humanity, believing that they are weak willed and the only way to give them salvation is to trap them inside her cinema domain, putting an end to their thoughts and isolating them from the hardships of life, at the cost of their freedom and increasing their depression even further. After our heroes defeat her, she returns into the form of the black-haired Nagi and vanishes into light, finally acknowledging the possibilities and strengths of humanity, but not before leaving a warning that she will return as long as people wish for her to, finally allowing the party to leave the Cinema. =Doe= :Voiced by: Kazuhiko Inoue is a character introduced in Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth. He is a weird shadow-like figure that is mostly quiet, that one day appeared in the theater, acting as a weird projectionist that would play the same movies over and over again.

Hikari is very afraid of him, and has a lot of trouble communicating or getting near with him, although she starts to become less fearful as the game progresses. After Hikari consensually followed Doe, leading her to ???, she decides to face her own past and so that she can recollect her memories lost from her amnesia. Our heroes, thinking that Doe kidnapped Hikari, they fight him in the deepest part of the labyrinth, after he goes berserk due to Hikari rejecting him. After they defeat him the truth is revealed: Doe is nothing more than a cognition of Hikari's father, created by her due to her depression and low self-esteem, starting to make her develop an inability to differ what is actually harmful to her and what actually isn't. This causes her to develop paranoia towards her father's supposed goodwill that results in the creation of Doe, whom she perceives as a terrifying figure that she could not even get close to. Realizing this, Hikari steps forward and hugs him, as he turns into an image of her father. She tearfully confesses all of her negative thoughts to him, and after the confession, he turns into one of the keys and fades into light. =Minor characters= Kurosawa :Voiced by: Hirofumi Tanaka is a police officer found at a station in Paulownia Mall.

Caving in New Zealand is an established hobby as well as being a part of commercial tourism. Recreational caving is practised by several hundred members of caving associations all over New Zealand, who take advantage of the widespread limestone karst cave systems present in the country, especially in the Waitomo District of the North Island and in the Nelson-Tasman region of the South Island. There are also several hundred thousands of visitors to various tourist caves in New Zealand per year,Caving tourism (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Accessed 2008-06-16.) though a majority of these trips would not properly be called caving.  History  = Overview = New Zealand caving as an exploratory sport is thought to have started with a group of Auckland-area people who started to explore the lava caves in the volcanic cones of the area in the 1940s (though commercialised trips through caves at Waitomo Caves had actually already existed for several decades). The group quickly progressed to exploring caves in the Waikato and King Country areas, and the New Zealand Speleological Society was founded in 1949 by Henry Lambert, with the first rough facilities at Waitomo being established in 1955.Caving in New Zealand (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand) In 1957, the discovery of Harwood's Hole in the South Island was to fully establish New Zealand as a country with extremely promising cave systems, and the cave with its 183 metre deep vertical entry shaft, and its passages extending for many hundreds of meters into the depths, was for a long time the deepest and most famous non- commercial cave in New Zealand. The area around Nelson also contains most of New Zealand's deepest caves (most discovered in the following decades), including Bulmer Cavern, a 70 km long cave system. New Zealand's cavers are mostly organised in the New Zealand Speleological Society (NZSS), with 9 affiliated caving clubs with a total of 300 members all over the country.History (from the New Zealand Speleological Society website. Retrieved 2007-10-08) = Accidents and rescues = There have been a number of notable caving accidents since the 1940s, and at least four deaths .Caving equipment and culture (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand) On 4 January 1960, Peter Lambert was killed by falling rocks while being winched out of Harwoods hole,Edgar Sixtus - One of the Early Cave Personalities (from Red Rose Cave and Pothole Club Newsletter Volume 36 Number 2 Article 3 June 1999) and in 1995, Dave Weaver drowned while cave diving in Pearse Resurgence near Nelson. In 1998, one of the most active cavers of the country, Kieran McKay, broke his jaw in Bulmer Cavern on Mt Owen. While the cavern has few squeezes and crawls, the operation to retrieve him from deep within the cave occupied around 80 cavers (in direct position or as support) from all over the country for several days. In 2007, Michael Brewer, another experienced caver, was struck by falling rock deep within the Greenlink-Middle Earth cave, in an incident which attracted widespread media attention in the country. Brewer suffered cracked ribs, concussion, and a broken pelvis. It took about 3 days to get him to the surface (a 3 km distance normally taking 5 hours), and while most of the distance was covered with Brewer on a stretcher, and several tight squeezes were widened with explosives, he had to be pushed and pulled through some sections. The effort involved more than 50 cavers and cost around NZ$100,000. In 2008, Jane Furket, a 28-year-old experienced recreational caver and member of the Nelson Caving Club, fell in the Luckie Strike cave west of Waitomo. She broke her hip and lost three teeth. New Zealand cave rescues are undertaken by SAR teams composed of experienced cavers who have also undergone specialised training courses and exercises. Caves As well as lava caves in the Auckland volcanic field there are numerous limestone caves in the North Island, with the most well known being the Waitomo Caves. The longest and deepest caves are in the Kahurangi National Park in the South Island Commercial caving operations New Zealand offers a number of adventure tourism activities and one of them is caving. Most of the commercial caving is done in the Waitomo area, but there are also tours offered in Fiordland and on the West Coast. Black water rafting, where the participants float through caves on tyre inner tubes, was an early tourism venture and has become extremely popular.

Founded in 1962, the see was originally part of the much larger Diocese of Labuan and its Dependencies which was established in 1855. Following the carving out of the Diocese of Singapore in 1909 from this last ecclesiastical territory, the area of the present-day Diocese fell under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Labuan & Sarawak, which was reorganised as the Diocese of Borneo in 1949. In 1962, the latter diocese was divided into two, forming the Diocese of Kuching and the Diocese of Jesselton, which was renamed the Diocese of Sabah when the capital city was given the new name of Kota Kinabalu in 1967. The territorial jurisdiction of the diocese covers the entire 73,904 km2 of Sabah and the 92 km2 of Labuan. Besides this, the Diocese also has a few mission churches in other parts of the Province of South East Asia, including in Indonesia and Thailand. The current Bishop of Sabah is the Right Reverend Datuk Melter Jiki bin Tais, the first Bumiputera (indigenous) person to hold the office and a senior clergyman of ethnic Kadazan-Dusun descent.  History  =19th century= Beginning of mission work The history of the Diocese of Sabah begins with the mission work which was carried out in the crown colony of Labuan and British North Borneo. In 1846, the island of Labuan was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultanate of Brunei as the result of the Treaty of Labuan. As there was no resident Anglican priest in Labuan, the Bishop of London granted the Lieutenant Governor, John Scott, the authority to perform weddings and funerals using the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. Among the first Anglican missionaries sent to Borneo in 1846 was the Revd Dr Francis Thomas McDougall, a priest, medical doctor and surgeon. Although his base was in Kuching, Sarawak, technicalities in canon law led to him being consecrated as the Bishop of Labuan and its Dependencies in 1855. The Church of Our Holy Saviour, Labuan which was the first Anglican church in the present-day Diocese of Sabah, was consecrated by Bishop McDougall in 1866, although there is evidence of a congregation on the island since 1850. In 1878, Baron von Overbeck, the Austrian Consul in Hong Kong, and Alfred Dent, a British entrepreneur, obtained territorial possession of what became British North Borneo. The North Borneo Chartered Company was set up to administer this region. The Englishman William Burgess Pryer was appointed \\"Resident\\" of the East Coast. He founded the town of Sandakan in 1879. A committed Anglican, Pryer requested ministerial assistance from the then-Bishop of Labuan, George Frederick Hose. Bishop Hose was unable to visit Sandakan until 1884 but in 1883 sent a Chinese catechist, Ah Leng, to minister to the Chinese-speaking Christians in Kudat as well as Sandakan. First two churches in North Borneo The first priest sent to North Borneo was the Revd William Henry Elton, a missionary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG). Arriving in Sandakan in 1888, he found a suitable piece of land to build the first Anglican church in present-day Sabah, St. Michael's and All Angels Church, Sandakan. He also set up St Michael's Boy's School and St Monica's Girls' School. The first capital of British North Borneo was Kudat. Groups of Hakka Christians were brought over from China to farm the surrounding area. Although they had been evangelised by disparate denominations back in China, Revd Elton managed to convince them to form a single congregation. Thus was St James' Church, Kudat born. The first Asian priest in North Borneo, the Revd Fong Hau Kong, was ordained deacon in 1898 and priest in 1910 having served as a catechist in Kudat. =20th century= Expansion on the coasts The port town of Jesselton was founded in 1899. Revd Elton swiftly secured land for a church, and the SPG sent a missionary priest, Revd George Clarke, to the area in 1902. By 1914 the mission included a boys' school, known later as All Saints' School, St Agnes' Girls School and All Saints' Parish Church. In the southeastern town of Tawau, the church of St Patrick's was finally established in 1917, 18 years after Revd Elton's first visit to the town in 1899. The first resident priest, Revd Vun Nen Vun, was a graduate of the short-lived but notable College of the Holy Way in Kudat, an experiment in educating local clergy. World War II and aftermath Mission work in the region was severely affected by the Second World War. The Japanese army's assault on North Borneo began on 27 December 1941, and by the end of February they had taken over the territory. Foreign clergy and other missionaries were interned, including Sisters Irene and Alison from the Community of the Companions of Jesus the Good Shepherd, who were serving as teachers in Sandakan. Into the vacuum created by the imprisonment of the missionaries stepped the few local clergy, including the five graduates of the College of the Holy Way, namely Revd Chin Phu Yin, Revd Chong En Siong, Revd Lai Chun Sang, Revd Lim Siong Teck and Revd Vun Nen Vun. Christians suffered persecution during the Japanese occupation as they were adherents of a faith considered to be \\"Western.\\" Nevertheless, most held on to their faith during this difficult time. North Borneo was liberated by the Allied Forces in October 1945. Much had to be done to rebuild the church both in a physical as well as a spiritual sense. The Rt Revd Nigel Cornwall, the newly-appointed Bishop of Borneo, managed to secure assistance in the form of missionary nurses, priests and teachers from the Australian Board of Missions and the Australian branch of the Church Mission Society. The Sabah Anglican Interior Mission (SAIM) Throughout the first seventy years of Anglican mission work in North Borneo, the focus had been on the coastal areas which were generally urban or semi-urban. An attempt to evangelise the peoples of the interior was started in Keningau in 1896, but this work among the Murut people had to be abandoned in 1902 due to the ill-health and transfer to Singapore of pioneer missionary Revd Fred Perry. Work in the interior resumed in earnest in 1958 with the founding of the Sabah Anglican Interior Mission (SAIM). The initial impetus behind the SAIM came from Bruce Sandilands, a district surveyor who was moved by the poverty he encountered during his trips along rivers which reached deep into the interior, such as the Kinabatangan. He convinced the Rector of St Michael's Sandakan, Revd Canon Frank Lomax, to accompany him upriver.

From 1991-2002, he produced opera as General Director of Fort Worth Opera in Fort Worth, Texas. Early life William Walker was born in Waco, Texas and moved with his family to Fort Worth at the age of 6, where his father eventually went to work for Consolidated Vultee, a predecessor of General Dynamics. Known as \\"Bill\\" to his family and friends, Walker began singing professionally at the age of 12 but secretly yearned to play baseball. After watching him strike out four times one night at a high school game, Walker's father suggested that perhaps his son should think more seriously about being a singer.\\"William Walker: Director of the Fort Worth Opera\\" Sheila Taylor Wells, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 3/10/94, Life section, p. 1, accessed 9/17/2007 In 1949, upon graduation from Arlington Heights High School, Walker was awarded a vocal scholarship to Texas Christian University.\\"A New Voice: William Walker Aims Opera in Different Direction,\\" Wayne Lee Gay, Fort Worth Star Telegram, 12/16/91, Life section, p. 1, accessed 8/27/2007 His studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the U.S. Army and sent to serve in the Korean War. During his time in Korea, he was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service. Upon his honorable discharge, Walker returned to Fort Worth, completed his bachelor's in voice and graduated from Texas Christian University in 1956. In 1957, he married the former Marci Martin and they moved to New York City.\\"A New Voice: William Walker Aims Opera in Different Direction\\" by Wayne Lee Gay, Fort Worth Star Telegram, 12/16/91, Life section, p. 1, 8/27/2007 Singing career In 1960, Walker made his Broadway debut as Tattoo in Wildcat, a musical comedy by N. Richard Nash, Cy Coleman, and Carolyn Leigh, starring Lucille Ball, directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd. He was listed in the program as \\"Bill Walker\\".Internet Broadway Database: Bill Walker Credits on Broadway A frequent performer in summer stock during the 1960s, Walker sang in many performances with the St. Louis Municipal Opera,The Muny the Kansas City Starlight Theatre, and the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera in such works as Blossom Time, The Desert Song, Damn Yankees, and Carousel. In 1962, Walker was a finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and was offered a contract to join the Metropolitan Opera.\\"A New Voice: William Walker Aims Opera in Different Direction,\\" Wayne Lee Gay, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 12/16/91, Life section, p.1, accessed 8/27/2007 His first roles at the Met were small ones, but subsequent exposure on television shows such as The Bell Telephone Hour, The Voice of Firestone, and most notably The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson‚Äîwhere Walker appeared some 60 times ‚Äì led to a higher profile in his opera career. During his 18 seasons there, Walker gave more than 360 performances at the Met and sang the role of Marcello in La boh√®me more than 30 times.Metropolitan Opera Association In 1965, Walker was featured in two new productions at the Met. He was selected to sing the role of Valentin in Faust co-starring Nicolai Gedda, Gabriella Tucci and Cesare Siepi, directed by Jean-Louis Barrault and conducted by Georges Pr√™tre. He also sang the role of Prince Yeletsky in a new English-language production of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, conducted by Thomas Schippers. In 1972, Walker repeated the role in the first production of The Queen of Spades ever presented in its original Russian at the Met. In 1975 when the Met toured Japan for the first time, Walker sang the role of Marcello in La boh√®me with Franco Corelli and Dorothy Kirsten. The following season, Walker stepped in for an ailing colleague and sang the role of Germont in La traviata for the first time at the Met, a role he had already sung at the Santa Fe Opera and in other regional productions. Critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times, \\"the best singing of the night came from Mr. Walker,\\"The Opera; 'La Traviata' Is Led by Miss Caldwell - Free Preview - The New York Times and Time magazine called his Germont \\"splendidly sung.\\"\\"An Elegant Debut\\", Printout, Time Other roles at the Met included Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Papageno in The Magic Flute, Lescaut in Manon Lescaut, Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, Ford in Falstaff, Escamillo in Carmen, the High Priest in Samson et Dalila, Peter in Hansel und Gretel, Schaunard in La boh√®me, Count Di Luna in Il trovatore, The Herald in Lohengrin, Michele in Il tabarro, Silvio in Pagliacci, Dr. Malatesta in Don Pasquale, and Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor Walker's career included performances at the White House: In 1967 during the Johnson administration he was the principal entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. During the Carter administration, he sang at a White House state dinner honoring Helmut Schmidt, Chancellor of West Germany. In 1976, under the auspices of the U.S. State department, Walker was sent abroad to perform as a representative of the United States. In addition to recitals in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland and at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm, Walker sang Germont in La traviata and Amonasro in Aida in both Warsaw and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, in Poland. From 1969 to 1976, Walker gave more than 250 solo recitals in the United States and Canada, performing classical operatic arias, art songs and American musical show stoppers, most memorably \\"Soliloquy\\" from Carousel and \\"Surrey With The Fringe On Top\\" from Oklahoma!. With a technique considered innovative at the time, Walker addressed his recital audiences directly from the stage, interspersing his songs with funny, often self-deprecating stories, making him a more accessible performer to his audiences then the stereotypically aloof classical artist. Walker was a frequent soloist with many great American orchestras, including the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. In the 1970s, Walker appeared twice at Carnegie Hall as the baritone soloist in performances of Mahler's 8th Symphony with the Chicago Symphony, conducted by Sir Georg Solti. Walker retired from singing in 1982. In 1970, Walker was named Distinguished Alumnus of the Year by his alma mater, Texas Christian University. In 1980, he was named the Hearndon Distinguished Visiting Professor of Music at Texas Christian University and taught master classes in performance for several years. He also taught master classes as the Carol Kyle Distinguished Visiting Professor of Music at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas from 1980 to 1984. General Director, Fort Worth Opera In 1991, Walker returned to his hometown of Fort Worth to accept the position of General Director of the Fort Worth Opera, a small regional company \\"with a low budget, low profile and low community confidence.\\"\\"Singing a happy tune: William Walker aims to bolster reputation of Fort Worth Opera,\\" Wayne Lee Gay, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 11/19/1992, A&E; section, page 1, accessed 8/29/07 Even when he was still at the Met and working with world- class stage directors and designers, Walker believed that great singing was what made great opera. \\"'That's what opera's all about, you know: let the opera singer sing and opera will flourish.'\\"\\"New In Seville\\", Florence Stevenson, Opera News, March 2, 1974, p. 19 When he began to produce opera in Fort Worth, Walker capitalized on this philosophy of \\"a singer's opera\\" by recognizing the opportunity for Fort Worth Opera to be a showcase for up-and- coming vocal talent.

She was the common- law wife of the prominent anarcho-syndicalist leader Rudolf Rocker. The couple's son, Fermin Rocker, was an artist. Early life and period in London Witkop was born Vitkopski in the Ukrainian shtetl of Zlatopol to a Jewish Ukrainian-Russian family as the oldest of four sisters. The youngest of the four, Rose, also became a well-known anarchist. In 1894, Witkop left the Ukraine for London. In the decades following the 1881 assassination of Czar Alexander II, many Jews left Russia as a result of anti-Jewish pogroms throughout the Empire. Most went to the United Kingdom or the United States.Wolf 2007. December 1906 edition of Germinal In London, she worked in a tailoring sweatshop and saved enough money to finance her parents' and sisters' passage to England. The hard conditions she worked under led her to question her faith. Her involvement in a bakers' strike led her to become involved with the group around the Jewish anarchist newspaper Arbayter Fraynd. She became influenced by the works of the anarchist theorist Peter Kropotkin. In 1895, she first met Rudolf Rocker in the course of her political work. In May 1898, Rocker invited her to accompany him to New York City, where he hoped to find employment. The two were, however, not admitted to the country, because they refused to get married legally and were returned to the United Kingdom with the same ship on which they had reached the United States. The matter received some newspaper coverage in the United States at the time, attacking the couple's love without marriage.Fishman 1974, pg. 237‚Äì238. From October 1898, Rocker and Witkop co-edited the Arbeyter Fraynd. In March 1900, the two also started publishing the newspaper Germinal, which was more focused on cultural topics. In 1907, the couple's son, Fermin, was born. Rocker and Witkop were opposed to World War I after it broke out in 1914, unlike many other anarchists such as Kropotkin, who supported the Allied cause. To ease the poverty and deprivation caused by the joblessness that accompanied the war, Witkop and her husband opened a soup kitchen. In December 1914, however, Rocker like many Germans and Austrians in the UK, was interned as an enemy alien. Witkop continued her anti-war activities until she was also arrested in 1916. She remained imprisoned until the autumn of 1918. She then left the United Kingdom to join her husband and son in the Netherlands. Germany At first, the couple welcomed the February and October Revolutions in Russia, but after the Bolshevik coup they started criticizing the statism and totalitarianism of what would become the Soviet Union. In November 1918, they moved to Berlin; Rocker had been invited by Free Association of German Trade Unions (FVdG) chairman Fritz Kater to join him in building up what would become the Free Workers' Union of Germany (FAUD), an anarcho-syndicalist trade union.Vallance 1973, pg. 77‚Äì78. Both Rocker and Witkop became members of the FAUD. After its founding in early 1919, a discussion about the role of girls and women in the union started. The male-dominated organization had at first ignored gender issues, but soon women started founding their own unions, which were organized parallel to the regular unions, but still formed part of the FAUD. Witkop was one of the leading founders of the Women's Union in Berlin in 1920. On October 15, 1921, the women's unions held a national congress in D√ºsseldorf and the Syndicalist Women's Union (SFB) was founded on a national level. Shortly thereafter, Witkop drafted Was will der Syndikalistische Frauenbund? (What Does the Syndicalist Women's Union Want?) as a platform for the SFB. From 1921, the Der Frauenbund was published as a supplement to the FAUD organ Der Syndikalist, Witkop was one of its primary writers. Witkop reasoned that proletarian women were exploited not only by capitalism like male workers, but also by their male counterparts. She contended therefore that women must actively fight for their rights, much like workers must fight capitalism for theirs. She also insisted on the necessity of women taking part in class struggle. Housewives could use boycotts to support this struggle. From this, she concluded the necessity of an autonomous women's organization in the FAUD. Witkop also held that domestic work should be deemed equally valuable to wage labor.R√ºbner 1994, pg. 185‚Äì189. In a 1921 article in Der Frauenbund, Witkop argued that the most important issue facing the SFB was the \\"sexual issue\\". She called for access to birth control and advocated a childbearing strike. A debate on the issue within the German syndicalist movement ensued. Meetings on the issue were well-attended meetings and new SFB chapters were formed.Nelles 2000, pg. 3. United States She was not only active in the syndicalist and feminist movement, but also worked to fight racism and anti-Semitism. She was often frustrated by what she considered an unwillingness to fight anti-Semitism in the labor movement. The rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the late 1920s greatly troubled Witkop. After the Reichstag fire in February 1933, Witkop and Rocker fled Germany for the United States via Switzerland, France, and the UK. In the US, the couple continued to give lectures and write about anarchist topics. During the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, they started an awareness campaign to educate Americans about the events in Spain. In Fall 1937, the two moved to the Mohegan Commune near Lake Mohegan in Crompond. After World War II broke out, Witkop, like her husband and other anarchists such as Max Nettlau and Diego Abad de Santill√°n, supported the Allies because she felt Nazism could not be defeated with pacifist means. After World War II, Witkop had some sympathy for the Zionist movement, but was skeptical as to whether a nation state could solve the \\"Jewish question\\". She favored the idea of bi-nationality developed by Martin Buber and Ahad Ha'am. The Mohegan commune, especially Witkop, was active in sending material support to German anarchists. They sent several hundred packages to Germany. Witkop died on November 23, 1955. She had been suffering from difficulties of breathing for months.

The need for the equation arises from the inability to solve the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations in the turbulent flow regime, even for a Newtonian fluid. When the concentration and temperature profiles are independent of one another, the mass-heat transfer analogy can be employed. In the mass-heat transfer analogy, heat transfer dimensionless quantities are replaced with analogous mass transfer dimensionless quantities. This equation is named after Stuart W. Churchill and M. Bernstein, who introduced it in 1977. This equation is also called the Churchill‚ÄìBernstein correlation. Heat transfer definition :\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{Nu}}_D \\\\ = 0.3 + \\\\frac{0.62\\\\mathrm{Re}_D^{1/2}\\\\Pr^{1/3}}{\\\\left[1 + (0.4/\\\\Pr)^{2/3} \\\\, \\\\right]^{1/4} \\\\,}\\\\bigg[1 + \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Re}_D}{282000} \\\\bigg)^{5/8}\\\\bigg]^{4/5} \\\\quad \\\\Pr\\\\mathrm{Re}_D \\\\ge 0.2 where: * \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{Nu}}_D is the surface averaged Nusselt number with characteristic length of diameter; * \\\\mathrm{Re}_D\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the Reynolds number with the cylinder diameter as its characteristic length; * \\\\Pr is the Prandtl number. The Churchill‚ÄìBernstein equation is valid for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Prandtl numbers, as long as the product of the two is greater than or equal to 0.2, as defined above. The Churchill‚ÄìBernstein equation can be used for any object of cylindrical geometry in which boundary layers develop freely, without constraints imposed by other surfaces. Properties of the external free stream fluid are to be evaluated at the film temperature in order to account for the variation of the fluid properties at different temperatures. One should not expect much more than 20% accuracy from the above equation due to the wide range of flow conditions that the equation encompasses. The Churchill‚ÄìBernstein equation is a correlation and cannot be derived from principles of fluid dynamics. The equation yields the surface averaged Nusselt number, which is used to determine the average convective heat transfer coefficient. Newton's law of cooling (in the form of heat loss per surface area being equal to heat transfer coefficient multiplied by temperature gradient) can then be invoked to determine the heat loss or gain from the object, fluid and/or surface temperatures, and the area of the object, depending on what information is known. Mass transfer definition :\\\\mathrm{Sh}_D = 0.3 + \\\\frac{0.62\\\\mathrm{Re}_D^{1/2}\\\\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}}{\\\\left[1 + (0.4/\\\\mathrm{Sc})^{2/3} \\\\, \\\\right]^{1/4} \\\\,}\\\\bigg[1 + \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Re}_D}{282000} \\\\bigg)^{5/8}\\\\bigg]^{4/5} \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{Sc}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Re}_D \\\\ge 0.2 where: * \\\\mathrm{Sh}_D is the Sherwood number related to hydraulic diameter * \\\\mathrm{Sc} is the Schmidt number Using the mass-heat transfer analogy, the Nusselt number is replaced by the Sherwood number, and the Prandtl number is replaced by the Schmidt number. The same restrictions described in the heat transfer definition are applied to the mass transfer definition. The Sherwood number can be used to find an overall mass transfer coefficient and applied to Fick's law of diffusion to find concentration profiles and mass transfer fluxes.

Due to the topology of PON, the transmission modes for downstream (that is, from optical line termination, (OLT) to optical network unit (ONU)) and upstream (that is, from ONU to OLT) are different. For the downstream transmission, the OLT broadcasts optical signal to all the ONUs in continuous mode (CM), that is, the downstream channel always has optical data signal. One given ONU can find which frame in the CM stream is for it by reading the header of the frame. However, in the upstream channel, ONUs can not transmit optical data signal in CM. It is because that all the signals transmitted from the ONUs converge (with attenuation) into one fiber by the power splitter (serving as power coupler), and overlap among themselves if CM is used. To solve this problem, burst mode (BM) transmission is adopted for upstream channel. The given ONU only transmits optical packet when it is allocated a time slot and it needs to transmit, and all the ONUs share the upstream channel in the time division multiple access (TDMA) mode. The phases of the BM optical packets received by the OLT are different from packet to packet, since the ONUs are not synchronized to transmit optical packet in the same phase, and the distance between OLT and given ONU are random. In order to compensate the phase variation from packet to packet, burst mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) is required. Such circuit can generate local clock with the frequency and phase same as the individual received optical packet in a short locking time, for example within 40 ns.Rec.

Above all, the clock and data recovery can be performed correctly after a short locking time.

Various other schemes have been invented, including those employing gated oscillator or injection locked oscillator.

The park land was first acquired by the state in 1941 with the purchase of the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company, which became the Chesapeake Bay Ferry System. The Sandy Point- Matapeake Ferry was discontinued in 1952. Afterwards, uses for the land by the state included a shooting range and a building housing a scale model of the Chesapeake Bay. The bay model was made obsolete by computer simulations, and the building was left vacant. Following the 2003 collapse of the building during that year's Presidents' Day snowstorm, the county resumed renovation of the ferry terminal building and renamed it the Matapeake Clubhouse. The Matapeake Clubhouse and adjoining public beach opened to the public in May 2009. Activities and amenities Park grounds include the restored ferry house and former ferry landing, which is used as a fishing pier. The park offers a swimming beach, amphitheater, trails, picnicking area, dog beach, and views of the Bay Bridge. It is the northern terminus of the paved Kent Island South Trail, which extends from the park to Romancoke Pier.

It later reopened as Kinston Airport and is now known as Kinston Regional Jetport. History Stallings Air Base originally was built in 1944 by the United States Navy. It opened in October as a United States Marine Corps flying training airfield known as Marine Corps Auxiliary Airfield Kinston, being an auxiliary field to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. Construction involved building runways and several aircraft hangars, with three concrete runways, several taxiways, a large parking apron and a control tower. Buildings were ultimately utilitarian and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were constructed of temporary or semi- permanent materials. Although some hangars had steel frames and the occasional brick or tile brick building could be seen, most support buildings sat on concrete foundations but were of frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper. Naval Aviation Cadets received V-5 flight training along with basic flying indoctrination at the airfield until the facility was closed on 31 October 1945. As a result of the Cold War and the expansion of the United States Air Force, Kinston Air BaseAir Training Command applied the \\"Air Base\\" designation to private contractor-operated flying training bases in continental United States during the 1950s and early 1960s. With the advent of the jet-powered Cessna T-37, Northrop T-38 Talon, and the establishment of the Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) system whereby prospective USAF pilots would receive all initial flight training at a single base, the USAF contract flying training program was deemed superfluous. All stateside air bases conducting such contract flying training were phased out and closed by the early 1960s, the facilities transitioning to either auxiliary fields of active air force bases or to civilian airport status. was reopened on 17 October 1950 by the USAF Air Training Command, as a contract flying training school. The 3308th Flying Training Squadron (Contract Flying) was the operational training unit at the base, with ground and flight training being supplied by the Serv- Air Aviation Corporation. Training at Kinston began on 17 October 1951. In May 1952, Air Training Command renamed Kinston Airfield as Stallings Air Base in memory of Kinston natives Lt Bruce Stallings, a P-51 Mustang pilot killed in March 1945, and his brother, Lt Harry Stallings, a B-29 Superfortress navigator killed in April 1945. The base conducted flying training and contract flying training initially with Link T-8 and T-18 trainers, later being upgraded to Beechcraft T-34 Mentor and North American T-28 Trojan aircraft. In April 1957, ATC proposed that the contract training at Stallings AB be closed. This recommendation was approved in September and on 1 October flying training ended at Stallings AB. The base was formally inactivated on 27 November 1957. Notes References * Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942-2002.

He is known for his contributions to the flora of the Caribbean and Brazil, and for his work as curator of the Berlin Botanical Garden. Born the son of a brewer, Urban showed an interest in botany as an undergraduate. He pursued further study at the University of Bonn and later at the University of Berlin where he gained a doctorate in 1873. Urban was appointed by A. W. Eichler to run the Berlin Botanical Garden and supervised its move to Dahlem. He also worked as Eichler's assistant on the Flora Brasiliensis, later succeeding him as editor. In 1884 Urban began working with Leopold Krug on his Puerto Rican collections, a collaboration would later produce the nine-volume Symbolae Antillanae, one of his most important contributions, and his 30-part Sertum Antillanum. Urban's herbarium, estimated to include 80,000 or more sheets, was destroyed when the Berlin Herbarium was bombed in 1943, during the Second World War. Early life and education Urban was born in Warburg, Province of Westphalia, in the Kingdom of Prussia in 1848 as the son of a prosperous brewer. He was educated at the local Gymnasium, and later in Paderborn before proceeding to the University of Bonn and then the University of Berlin. He served in the military between 1869 and 1871 (seeing action in the Franco- Prussian War) before returning to his studies. He received his doctorate in 1873 and took up a teaching position in Lichterfelde. Berlin Botanical Garden In 1878 Eichler was appointed head of Botany at the University of Berlin. Eichler appointed Urban as assistant head of the Berlin Botanical Garden, and in 1883 he was promoted to the position of curator. As curator of the Garden, Urban supervised their transfer from their original site to their present site in Berlin-Dahlem. Flora of Brazil Urban worked as Eichler's assistant in the production of the Flora Brasiliensis, which had been initiated by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius and Stephan Endlicher in 1840. Urban later took over as editor after Eichler's death, and saw the work through to its completion in 1906. Caribbean botany and Symbolae Antillanae In 1884 Urban began working with Leopold Krug on his plant collections. Krug was a German businessman based in Puerto Rico who had developed an interest in biology. Together with his friend Domingo Bello y Espinosa, Krug had accumulated a large collection of plants and had done a series of illustrations and plates. Returning to Berlin in 1876, Krug had worked with botanist Friz Kurtz to attempt to identify his collections. When Bello published a portion of the work (which Krug had envisioned as a joint work), without reference to Krug's contributions, Krug was determined to publish his work. After Kurtz emigrated to Argentina in 1884, Krug collaborated with Urban. Krug hired plant collector Paul Sintenis to work in Puerto Rico, especially in the mountainous areas where Krug and Bello had made few collections. Between 1884 and 1887 Sintenis made 8450 collections, the best of which were retained by Urban in Berlin. The remainder were sold as duplicated to other collections, and the proceeds used by Urban to fund further collections. With Krug's support Urban subsidised Henrik von Eggers collections, and later helped secure support for Erik Ekman's collections in Cuba and Hispaniola. He also exchanged material extensively with other botanists and distributed fragments of his type collections so widely. This became especially important after his original collections, estimated to consist of 80,000 sheets or more, were destroyed when the Berlin Herbarium was bombed in 1943, during World War II. In 1886 Urban published his first paper primarily dedicated to Caribbean plants. In 1898 he began the publication of Symbolae Antillanae seu fundamenta Florae Indiae Occidentalis. In 1913 he retired, having produced seven volumes of Symbolae Antillanae. He then began work on Sertum Antillanum which eventually became a 30-part series, completed in 1930. Volume eight of Symbolae Antillanae was completed in 1921, and volume nine in 1928. Urban continued working until a few weeks before his death in 1931, on the morning of his eighty-third birthday.

The game propounds the conspiracy theory that all of human history is a lie and that the human race's development and evolution were aided by extraterrestrials. The player attempts to uncover the truth through the course of the game by traveling to a variety of different worlds, interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles. Drowned God is based on a forged manuscript written by Harry Horse in 1983, purported to have been written by 19th-century poet Richard Henry Horne, who shares Horse's name. After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing Myst and 7th Guest in the mid-1990s, whereupon he decided a first person adventure game would be the best way to tell the manuscript's story. Producer Algy Williams hired a team of multimedia artists and programmers to help Horse develop Drowned God. Upon its release, the game sold well, but it quickly faded in popularity due to bugs and a lack of patches. Drowned Gods concept and visuals were widely praised, while its gameplay, audio, and puzzles received more varied responses. A planned sequel never came to fruition. Plot =Background= Drowned God's concept centers around the idea that human history has been manipulated to cover up certain facts. The true history, according to the game, is that aliens from the Orion area of space seeded humanity on Earth thousands of years ago and have since guided its development. An ancient, highly developed civilization was lost millennia ago in the Great Flood. The library of Alexandria housed much of what game writer Harry Horse called \\"forbidden knowledge\\" before it was destroyed; the Knights Templar, whose membership included luminaries such as Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton, preserved the information for centuries. In the 20th century, the Philadelphia Experiment opened a gateway into another dimension, first freeing the aliens Horse refers to as \\"the Legion\\", and an independent government group spent the subsequent decades in contact with the aliens following the Roswell UFO incident. =Story= The game's plot begins in a chamber containing the Bequest Globe, a device which the player has recently inherited. The Globe is a giant brass cylinder full of gears, fronted by a clock face made of sliding and rotating plates comprising twenty-two Roman numerals, which represent the Major Arcana, with the Jewish Kabbalah in its center. A voice welcomes the player and tells them the Globe is a gift, then explains that the player must unlock the secret of the drowned god. The player initially must enter their name into the device, which then displays a series of past lives the player has lived. The name is converted into its numerological equivalent. Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called Kether and Malchut respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task. The motivations of the two organizations represented by the faces are murky, although it becomes clear they are acting in opposition to each other. Both masks refer to the player by their assigned number. The player must enter four different worlds through the Bequest Globe, each of which is an amalgamation of historical and fantastical elements and is named after one of the sephirot on the kabbalistic Tree of Life. The player seeks to recover four lost artifacts: the Rod of Osiris, the Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone, and the Ark of the Covenant. According to Horse, \\"The relics you're searching for are not what you think they are\\". The first world, Binah, includes aspects of Arthurian legend, including Morgan Le Fey and the Knights Templar, as well as Stonehenge. The second, Chesed, features Aztec ruins and a submarine interior. The third, Din, centers around an underground transit system, a steampunk carnival, and a mechanical maze. The final world, Chokmah, takes place outside Area 51. Throughout the game, the player finds and uses Tarot cards to unlock new areas and gain more information about the true history of the world. Upon returning to the Bequest Globe between worlds, the player sees the Roman numerals in its display light up in relation to the cards that have been recovered. After recovering three of the lost artifacts, the player fails to recover the last one, the Ark of the Covenant, which takes the form of a nuclear warhead. The player is able to choose one of three endings, depending on whether they decide to enter a final doorway in the chambers of one of the two opposing factions represented by Kether and Malchut, or enter a new central chamber via the Bequest Globe. Choosing either of the two doors results in an ending in which the player is trapped in a dystopian world: either Kether's, a technological police state, or Malchut's, a society of forced genetic manipulation. Both have ominous men in black overseeing the proceedings. If the player instead chooses to open the central chamber, a scene with a group of grey aliens approaching is briefly shown, wherein they say, \\"We are coming, for we are Legion.\\" All three options lead to the same ending credits, which feature a voice-over describing the murder of Osiris. Gameplay The Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton dialogue puzzle, described as \\"brilliant\\" by critics Drowned God uses a point-and-click interface and first person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and interacts with the game world by clicking the mouse on different parts of the screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline. The game is filled with a variety of puzzles that must be solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve competing against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges. One of the best received puzzles in the game involves arranging the pieces of a dialogue between the sculpted heads of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The player listens to the randomly ordered statements made by each head, then decides how to chronologically arrange the statements to form a coherent conversation based on context. Development Harry Horse conceived the game's ancient planetwide conspiracy. Horse had previously written several children's books and received the Scottish Arts Council Writer of the Year award for his 1983 book The Ogopogo: My Journey with the Loch Ness Monster. He began forging documents that same year as a way to earn money. The story which became the basis for Drowned God was originally a phony manuscript Horse wrote in 1983, ostensibly describing events after the destruction of the lost city of Atlantis. The manuscript, dated 1846, was said to have been written by the English poet Richard Horne, who shares Horse's birth name. Horse's initiation into the concept of an alternate history came in the early 1980s, when he first encountered professor Ian Halpke, who explained to him that information from the Kabbalah and ancient Jewish texts \\"hide and encipher the secret\\", namely, human evolution was aided by extraterrestrial intelligence. According to Horse, Halpke believed the Ark of the Covenant was a nuclear device, and that humans and pigs share compatible genes. Initially, experts determined the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched the time period Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests. Horse had written the manuscript without knowing any of these details. After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played Myst and 7th Guest and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory-inspired ideas. He later said that while the story of Myst did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on Drowned God in 1994. The game was originally commissioned by a division of Time Warner and was later taken over by Inscape when that division closed. Horse worked with Inigo Orduna and Anthony McGaw for six months designing the game, then cooperated with the game's artists and modelers until the project's completion. The game's producer, Algy Williams, hired puzzle expert Chris Maslanka, whose output he called \\"fiendishly difficult\\", to design the game's puzzles together with John Morris. Williams also employed sculptor Greg Boulton, who had previously worked on the Peter Gabriel video \\"Sledgehammer\\". Drowned God music was written and performed by an ambient music duo operating under the name Miasma. William S. Burroughs was originally scheduled to narrate the game, but died just before he could begin recording. McGaw and Williams later founded the company Babel Media, which specializes in video game localization. Release Drowned God was released on October 31, 1996 for the Windows 95 operating system. Around the same time there was going to be a release for Windows 3.1 but those plans were cancelled. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000 copies in the United States. It was one of the top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it to fall out of favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000 copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and that the rest of the story would be revealed in a sequel called CULT, planned to center around Area 51. However, he killed himself, as well as his wife and pets, a decade after the game's release, and no sequel was ever completed. Reception Drowned God received mixed reviews, with many critics complimenting the game's ideas and imagery while giving a less favorable response to its audio, puzzles, and execution. GameSpot reviewer Vince Broady wrote that the game sounded very promising, and might \\"also raise awareness of the thread of deception that runs throughout recorded history.\\" Steve Ramsey of Quandary said Drowned God presented its massive assortment of conspiracy theories entertainingly. Ray Ivey of Just Adventure called Drowned God \\"the strangest, creepiest, most psychedelic adventure game I've yet to come across.\\" Although Ivey did not understand much of the game, he found it enjoyable, because \\"it made sense to the game's characters and creators.\\" T. Liam McDonald of PC Gamer wrote that he was \\"fascinated by the strong sense of style and the intellectual approach to terrific subject matter\\". Steven Levy and Patricia King of Newsweek found the game to be \\"richly detailed and original\\". (article details ) In 2012, Andy Hughes of Topless Robot put the game at the top of his list of \\"9 Surprising Literary References In Videogames\\". Hughes wrote that the game was one that could be played from start to finish \\"without having any idea what the hell's going on\\", noting its references to a wide variety of subjects, including Egyptian mythology, The Man in the Iron Mask, and the Bermuda Triangle. Broady complimented the graphics, writing, \\"Drowned God is loaded with freaky animations and unexpected visual twists\\". Ramsey praised the visuals and the audio, saying both contributed to the game's \\"shadowy and secretive feelings\\". His one significant criticism was that dialogue was difficult to hear, with no option to display text for it. Regarding the game's audio aspect, Broady said, \\"The soundtrack is less impressive, primarily because of overuse: The background effects drone on mercilessly, and many of the game's narratives (which are universally well-written and finely acted) must be listened to over and over again.\\" The puzzles, according to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some \\"hopelessly difficult\\" and others extremely derivative. By contrast, he viewed the Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton dialogue puzzle as \\"brilliant\\", but said, \\"Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen far too many times already.\\" Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing \\"on almost every occasion I felt that I was making progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost.\\" He felt the puzzles were mostly well- integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, \\"For puzzle lovers, Drowned God is a treasure trove. ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative.\\" Broady panned the navigation for being confusing, counter-intuitive, and requiring the player to revisit locations multiple times. He concluded his review by saying, \\"The net effect is that the story‚Äîwhich made this game so intriguing in the first place‚Äîis almost totally lost, and that is a shame.\\" GameSpot considered the game one of the most disappointing of 1996 in their annual recap, writing \\"the great premise is buried like the mysteries of the ages themselves under a mediocre Myst clone\\". Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly opined that the game tried to be too many things, and quipped, \\"the result is a game so obscure, you'd be better off perusing something more comprehensible‚Äîlike the collected works of Zoroaster.\\" Mark Reece and Brooke Adams of Deseret News also had mixed feelings about the game, calling it both \\"clever and deep\\" and \\"frustrating and difficult\\". McDonald wrote that he was \\"frustrated by the lack of good game play.\\" Hughes called the pace of the game and its puzzles both \\"tedious\\" and \\"ponderous\\", but said it \\"had ambition out the genetically modified ears.\\" The editors of CNET Gamecenter nominated Drowned God for their 1996 \\"Best Adventure Game\\" award, which ultimately went to The Neverhood. They wrote, \\"The National Enquirer meets Myst. For the adventure gamer with a taste for mouse-pounding puzzles‚Äîit just didn't get much better than this.\\" References External links *Drowned God Electronic Press Kit at Internet Archive *Review in PC World Category:1996 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:First-person adventure games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Science fiction video games ","title":"Drowned God"},{"id":"13624329","text":"Robbie Nell Tilley Branscum (June 17, 1934 ‚Äì May 24, 1997) was an American writer of children's books and young adult fiction.

It, arguably, was the novel that first brought fame to Pennac, his earlier novel Au bonheur des ogres debuting to comparatively muted acclaim. La f√©e carabine was a critical success, winning three literary awards in 1988: the Troph√©e 813 for best novel, the Grenoble polar (whodunnit) prize, and that of the city of Mans. Plot summary The novel is set in the modern Parisian quarter of Belleville. It starts with the dramatic death of a policeman, shot by a \\"grannie\\" he was trying to help, and witnessed by at least four others who conveniently forget all details of what they see. The inspector Van Thian goes undercover as a Vietnamese old woman to investigate. Three other investigations follow: one into the attempted murder of a young woman, another into the serial killings of small old women in the district, and a third into drug trafficking by old men. Benjamin Malauss√®nne, professional scapegoat, quickly becomes suspect number one of all four investigations, owing to the numerous children of his prolific mother he lives with, the various old men with obsolete talents that he shelters, and his repeated abortive romantic affairs. Like all novels in the Malauss√®ne saga, the setting is anything but conventional, the streets of Paris brimming with immigrants in open celebration of their diversity, the situations rarely Gallic yet authentically Parisian. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations La f√©e carabine was adapted for television in 1988 by Yves Boisset, starring Tom Novembre as Malauss√®ne, Fabrice Luchini, Anna Galiena, Daniel Emilfork and Hubert Deschamps.

(2007): Podoctidae Roewer, 1912. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 221ff Description Body length ranges from 2.5 to 5 millimeters, with leg length ranging from three to almost thirty mm. While most species are brown to yellow, some are deep green. The legs may be ringed in black and yellow. The penis is uniquely built. Distribution Most species occur in Southeast Asia, especially in New Guinea. Others are found in Melanesia, Micronesia, Japan, India and Sri Lanka, Madagascar, the Seychelles and Mauritius, and central Africa. Ibantila cubana was introduced in a botanical garden in Cuba. Although one Podoctidae was described from Brazil in 1938, it was later transferred to Triaenonychidae. Relationships Although Podoctidae are currently included in Samooidea, and are surely Grassatores, there is no obvious relationship with any family.

It is a fictional interpretation of the life of Theodosia Burr Alston, set against a historical background of Aaron Burr's Vice Presidency of the United States, and his subsequent years. The book focuses on the life of Theodosia: her marriage to Joseph Alston; her suggested romance with Meriwether Lewis; and ultimately her unwavering devotion to her father Aaron Burr, and his devotion to her. Plot summary The story begins on Theodosia's seventeenth birthday in the year 1800, where her father Aaron Burr introduces Theodosia to her soon to be husband Joseph Alston. Theodosia is not keen on her father's choice for a husband, for she does not realise that her father hopes the marriage will increase his political support in the southern states, as well as lead to financial gain. During Theodosia and Joseph's official courtship, by chance Theodosia meets Meriwether Lewis, and the two are instantly attracted to each other. However Aaron Burr spots the two together, and eliminates any chance of a romance before it begins. Reluctantly but dutifully, Theodosia capitulates to her father's wishes and marries Joseph Alston in February 1801. The couple then settle in Joseph's home state of South Carolina, and Theodosia soon gives birth to her first and only child. However Theodosia is never happy in the South and constantly longs for the company of her father (and a reunification with Meriwether Lewis). The story moves on through Aaron Burr's time as Vice President: his controversial actions dueling Alexander Hamilton; his working to take over Mexico, naming himself as king; and his subsequent trial. Theodosia is always behind her father, even if it is at the cost of her marriage to Joseph, and her romance with Meriwether.  Historical accuracy  Though reviewers frequently comment on the meticulous research Seton put into her books, Richard N. Cote claims there are historical inaccuracies with My Theodosia. Both the putative romance with Meriwether Lewis and the depiction of the Alston marriage as unhappy are examples of fiction, not fact.Cote, Richard N., Theodosia Theodosia Burr Alston: Portrait of Prodigy, (2002).

He was born in Gondavale Budruk, a village in present-day Satara district, Maharashtra, India. His name prior to assuming sainthood was Ganpati. Brahmachaitanya was a devotee of the Hindu deity Rama and signed his name as 'Brahmachaitanya Ramdasi'. He was a disciple of Tukamai. Early life and initiation Brahmachaitanya or previously Ganpati was born to Geetabai and Ravji Ghugardare (Kulkarni). His parents were known to be devotees of the Hindu deity Vitthala. Ganpati left home in spiritual pursuits at an early age of nine. After knowing of his whereabouts, his father tracked him down and brought him back home from Kolhapur. He entered into his first marriage at the age of eleven. Soon at the age of twelve, he again left home in search of a spiritual guru. He traveled across India and is believed to have visited numerous contemporary saints and spiritual masters such as Swami Samarth of Akkalkot, Manik Prabhu, Trailanga Swami and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He later arrived at Yehalegaon, a village near Nanded and became a disciple of Tukamai. After a while, he was initiated by Tukamai and given the name 'Brahmachaitanya'. He reportedly attained enlightenment at the age of sixteen.  Return to Gondavale and later years  As per Tukamai's instructions, Brahmachaitanya went on a pilgrimage across India. He returned to Gondavale after nine years. Later, he and his wife lived in Nashik for some time. About a year later, his wife gave birth to a son who died early. His wife too passed away shortly after. At the insistence of his mother Geetabai, Brahmachaitanya married again. His second wife was blind since birth and later came to be known as Aaisaheb. thumb In later years, Brahmachaitanya continued to expound spiritual methods revolving around devotion to Rama. Initially, he had a Rama temple built as an extension to his residence. With time, the number of his disciples and followers continued to increase. In order to accommodate the large volumes of visitors, he arranged for the construction of Rama, Dattatreya and Shani temples along with an accommodation facility at Gondavale. He also had Rama temples built in other rural regions of Maharashtra. Between 1876 and 1896, a severe famine gripped Gondavale and the adjacent region. During this period, Brahmachaitanya helped save many lives from starvation by making provisions for employment on his farm and offering food to the needy. From 1890 onwards, he mostly lived in Gondavale. He breathed his last during the early hours of Monday, December 22, 1913 at Gondavale. Philosophy Brahmachaitanya was a proponent of Bhakti Yoga or the path of devotion. According to him, regular recalling of 'Rama-Nama' (mantra or japa) in everyday life ensures continuous remembrance of the divine and consequently leads to spiritual progress. He advocated for complete surrender to Rama as a pathway to contentment. He maintained that one need not sacrifice his or her material engagements to develop spiritually. He frequently emphasized upon the importance of discipline, selflessness, morality and compassion towards attaining well-being. His teachings were mostly aligned with that of Samarth Ramdas, a 17th-century Indian saint and philosopher. He frequently employed means such as pravachan (spiritual discourses), bhajan (hymns) and vaidik anushthaan (Vedic rituals) to engage people along the path of devotion. He encouraged cow protection and food donation.

Additionally, this differential is found on Chevrolet Express and GMC Savanna vans produced from 1973 to current day. Debuting in 1973, this differential is a full floating design with a ring gear diameter of . As the name implies, this differential has 14 bolts holding on the differential cover. The ring gear is not held on with 14 bolts, but rather 12. The 14 bolt differential is a popular axle swap option for Jeep Wrangler owners, and is referred to as the \\"corporate\\" 14 bolt because of the odd nature of GM's corporate structure in the 1970s. Not to be confused with the GM 14-bolt 9 and 1/2 inch ring gear rear differential which has c clips to retain the axles unlike a free floating axle that the heavy duty big brother utilizes. The 9 and 1/2 inch is easily identified from the 10 and 1/2 inch by looking at the hub. If the hub protrudes through the center of the wheel, that indicates the more desirable 10.5 and 1/2 inch full floating rear axle. The 9 and 1/2 inch rear end, while durable in its own right, is generally regarded as less desirable in high torque applications. The 9-1/2 c clip rear was in both the Suburban and pickups in both 6 or 8 lug varieties. 33 spline axles. and which was in production through 2009 and even available on a trailblazer SS, SAAB 97x.

The first design remained unchanged until 1986. This design had drums that were held on by the wheel studs and had a smaller diameter pinion bearing than the second design. The second design was produced from 1986 to present. One change that occurred in the second design was that on some models the brake drum could be removed without having to remove the hub and axle shaft. Additionally, the pinion received a larger diameter bearing while the pinion stayed the same diameter, which increased the durability of the pinion. All these axle are full floating. =Brakes= Most of the 14 bolt differentials produced through model year 1998 were fitted with drum brakes, but some vehicles with the 14 bolt were upgraded to disc brakes in 1999. Drum brakes were offered on many full size GM vans for several more years, only by 2003 all vans came with disc brakes. The first design of this differential had three different diameter brake drums. At first the differential was released with drums small enough to fit wheels. Then after a few years a larger drum was standard on the along with the even larger drum on the . This is an area of the axle assembly that is commonly converted by the enthusiast to disc brakes for added braking performance and lower cost of maintenance.http://www.fourwheeler.com/techarticles/drivetrain/129_1103_14_bolt_disc_brake_conversion/index.html =Pinion= The pinion is supported both in front of and behind the pinion teeth, an arrangement often referred to as \\"straddle mounting\\". Straddle mounting greatly reduces pinion deflection under high torque loads, conferring increased longevity and torque capacity. The pinion is also removable from the back as well making for easier access. =Re-purposing= The 10.5\\" 14 bolt differential and axle is quite popular with Jeep Wrangler owners who want to upgrade their standard Dana 30, Dana 35, or Dana 44 axle. While the 10.5\\" 14 bolt axle is heavier than the standard Dana axles offered on the Wrangler, it is much stronger. This increased strength allows Jeep Wrangler owners to mount up to 44\\" tires without concern about axle shaft breakage. Many Wrangler owners will have up to 2 inches removed from the bottom of the 10.5\\" 14 bolt differential housing to maximize ground clearance. Due to the popularity of GM trucks and vans, 10.5\\" 14 bolt axles are common in junkyards. This makes them an option for any number of vehicle customization projects, buggy builds, and even classic trucks. 11.5 AAM GMC All Terrain concept truck with 11.5 AAM axle The 11.5 AAM 14 bolt rear differential began to replace the 10.5\\" 14 bolt in many Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks beginning in the 2001 model year. However, the 10.5\\" 14 bolt axle continues in production today on GMC Savanna and Chevrolet Express vans. The 11.5\\" 14 bolt axle is also used in 3rd Generation Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks. The GM version uses a paper gasket and the Ram version uses a re-usable rubber gasket. This attribute also makes the Dodge and GM axles appear very different, because of the different cover used. The GM AAM axle tubes are reduced to smaller diameter than the AAM Dodge's at the spindle from the housing, from 4\\" to 3.5\\". Newer GM trucks are built to the same specs as the Dodge axles. GM also opted to have a vibration dampener installed on the yoke, while Dodge opted to place the dampener on the drive shaft. This became the standard axle on all 2500 and 3500 RAM trucks for model year 2014. =Features= *Increased GAWR: Max. *1541 alloy axle shafts *Larger ring and pinion than the \\"14 bolt\\" axle.

Most elections in the U.S. select one person; elections with multiple candidates selected by proportional representation are relatively rare. Typical examples include the House of Representatives, whose members are elected by a plurality of votes in single-member districts. The number of representatives from each state is set in proportion to each state's population in the most recent decennial census. District boundaries are usually redrawn after each such census. This process often produces \\"gerrymandered\\" district boundaries designed to increase and secure the majority of the party in power, often by offering secure seats to members of the opposition party. This is one of a number of institutional features that increase the advantage of incumbents seeking reelection. The Senate and the president are also elected by plurality. However, these elections are not affected by gerrymandering (with the possible exception of presidential races in Maine and Nebraska, whose electoral votes are partially allocated by Congressional district.) Proposals for electoral reform have included overturning the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC, public and citizen funding of elections, limits and transparency in funding, instant-runoff voting (IRV), abolishing the Electoral College or nullifying its impact through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, and improving ballot access for third parties, among others. The U.S. Constitution gives states wide latitude to determine how elections are conducted, although some details, such as the ban on poll taxes, are mandated at the federal level. Cost of the current system The cost of getting elected, especially to any national office in the US, has been growing. The Federal Elections Commission estimated that \\"candidates, parties, PACs, super-PACs, and politically active nonprofits\\" spent a total of $7 billion in 2012. The magazine Mother Jones said that this money was used \\"to influence races up and down the ballot\\", noting further that the cost of elections has continued to escalate. The 2010 congressional elections cost roughly $4 billion. Spending averages just under $3 billion per year for the 4-year presidential election cycle. This is small relative to what the major campaign contributors, crony capitalists (whether allegedly \\"liberal\\" or \\"conservative\\"), receive for their money.v:Documenting crony capitalism; v:Category:Documenting crony capitalism The Cato Institute found corporate welfare totaling $100 billion in the 2012 U.S. federal budget. This includes only direct subsidies specifically identified in the Cato Institute research. It does not include indirect subsidies like tax breaks,c.f. Double Irish arrangement trade barriers, distorting copyright law beyond the \\"limited time\\" and other restrictions mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, and other distortions of U.S. foreign and defense policies to benefit major corporations and people with substantial financial interests outside the U.S.In any nation, the primary constituency for foreign policy are those with financial interests outside the country. The former Speaker of the U.S. House Tip O'Neill said that, all politics is local. Foreign policy is in essence \\"local\\" to people with financial interests outside the country but is not local to many others. Part of this is the Military‚Äìindustrial complex, mentioned by then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The \\"Blowback\\" series by Chalmers Johnson documents some of this. Much higher dollar figures for the cost of crony capitalism can be obtained by looking at the increase in income inequality in recent decades. The average annual income (Gross Domestic Product per person or family) doubled between 1970 and 2010 (adjusted for inflation), but the typical (median) family income increased only 23 percent. The difference, 87 percent amounts to roughly $39,000 per year or $100 per day. This is discussed in more detail in Documenting crony capitalism and Cost of crony capitalism in the United States, based especially on data from the US Census Bureau and These data are combined in the \\"incomeInequality\\" data in the Ecdat package available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; see r-project.org). For this $100 per day to be meaningful, we must assume that the rate of economic growth during that period would have been the same as it was if the U.S. political economy had been managed to benefit all equally, as it had been from the end of World War II to 1970, during which period the rate of economic growth was slightly higher than it has been more recently. Other studies have estimated between $6 and $220 return for each $1 invested by major corporations and ultra-wealthy individuals in lobbying and political campaigns.Lessig (2011, p. 117) This rate of return helps escalate the cost of elections. To obtain the money needed for their next election campaign, incumbent politicians spend a substantial portion of their time soliciting money from large donors, who often donate to competing candidates, thereby buying access with the one that wins.Herrnson and Facheaux (2000) surveyed almost 2,000 candidates for office in the late 1990s. They found that the time devoted to fundraising tended to increase with the amount of funds raised and the level of the office. They estimated that 23.3 percent of candidates for statewide office spend over half their time fundraising and 55 percent spend over a quarter of their time. Local and judicial candidates need less money, and less than 6 percent of them spend over half their time asking for campaign contributions. This $3 billion per year is about $10 for each of the 316 million people in the US, $23 for each of the 130 million people who voted in 2012. Electoral reform proposals Josh Silver's \\"Cure for political corruption\\" divides electoral reforms between campaign finance, lobbying and election administration. Most of the proposed reforms can be achieved at least in part by legislation, though some require amending the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United and related decisions would require a constitutional amendment to permanently change, and several have been proposed. Similarly, some proposed systems for campaign finance and / or restrictions on campaign contributions have been declared unconstitutional; implementation of those changes could require a constitutional amendment. However, many other reforms can seemingly be achieved without a constitutional amendment. These include various forms of public financing of political campaigns, disclosure requirements and instant- runoff voting. The American Anti-Corruption Act (AACA) is one collection of reforms that appear to be consistent with existing US Supreme Court rulings, developed by Republican Trevor Potter, who had previously served as head of the US Federal Elections Commission under Democratic President Bill Clinton. Local versions of the AACA are being promoted by RepresentUs. =Campaign finance reform= Lawrence Lessig said, \\"On January 20, 2010, the day before Citizens United was decided, our democracy was already broken. Citizens United may have shot the body, but the body was already cold. And any response to Citizens United must also respond to that more fundamental corruption. We must find a way to restore a government 'dependent upon the People alone,' so that we give 'the People' a reason again to have confidence in their government.\\" Lessig favors systems that share as broadly as possible the decisions about which candidates or initiatives get the funding needed to get their message to the voters. Following Bruce Ackerman, Lessig recommends giving each eligible voter a \\"Democracy voucher\\" worth, e.g., $100 each election year that can only be spent on political candidates or issues. The amount would be fixed at roughly double the amount of private money spent in the previous election cycle. Unlike the current Presidential election campaign fund checkoff, the decisions regarding who gets that money would be made by individual citizens. Lessig also supports systems to provide tax rebates for such contributions or to match small dollar contributions such as the system in New York City that provides a 5-to-1 match for contributions up to $250. Malbin et al. established that the matching system used by New York City was associated with a statistically significant change in the demographics of donors. They did not, however, attempt to evaluate any change in the quality of governance. To be eligible for money from vouchers, rebates or matching funds, candidates must accept certain limits on the amounts of money raised from individual contributors. Vouchers, tax rebates, and small dollar matching are called \\"citizen funding\\" as opposed to more traditional \\"public funding\\", which tasks a public agency with deciding how much money each candidate receives from the government. While the Supreme Court of the United States has already struck down many forms of public funding of political campaigns, there are forms of public and especially citizen financing that seem consistent with the constitution as so far interpreted by the courts and could therefore be secured by standard legislative processes not requiring amending the constitution. One bill that proposes such a system for U.S. congressional elections is \\"The Grassroots Democracy Act\\". It was introduced September 14, 2012, by U.S. Representative John Sarbanes as H.R. 6426 and reintroduced on January 15, 2013 as H. R. 268. Overturning Citizens United The Citizens United decision, January 21, 2010, of the U.S. Supreme Court has received substantial notoriety, pushing many people to work for a constitutional amendment to overturn it. Key provisions of that decision assert in essence that money is speech and subject to first amendment protections. Move to Amend began organizing to oppose that decision in September 2009. By June 2013, they had at least 164 local affiliates in 36 states plus the District of Columbia. They had obtained roughly 300,000 individual signatures for their Motion to Amend and had secured the passage of 367 local resolutions and ordinances. United for the People is consortium of some 144 organizations supporting a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. The web site of United for the People lists 17 constitutional amendments introduced in the 112th United States Congress and 12 introduced by March 13, 2013, in the 113th proposing to overturn Citizens United in different ways. The libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute is concerned that most proposed responses to Citizens United will give \\"Congress unchecked new power over spending on political speech, power that will be certainly abused.\\" Clean elections, clean money, and disclosure Terms like \\"Clean elections\\" and \\"Clean money\\" are sometimes used inconsistently. Clean elections typically refers to systems where candidates receive a fixed sum of money from the government to run their campaigns after qualifying by collecting small dollar contributions (e.g., $5) from a large enough group of citizens. Systems of this nature have been tried in Maine, Arizona, North Carolina, New Mexico, Vermont, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Connecticut and elsewhere; some of these have been disqualified at least in part by the courts. \\"Clean money\\" is sometimes used as a synonym for clean elections; at other times, it refers to a DISCLOSE Act, requiring disclosure of the sources of campaign funds. The DISCLOSE Act bill in the U.S. Congress seeks \\"to prohibit foreign influence in Federal elections, to prohibit government contractors from making expenditures with respect to such elections, and to establish additional disclosure requirements with respect to spending in such elections, and for other purposes.\\" The California Clean Money Campaign is pushing the California DISCLOSE act, which differs substantially from the federal DISCLOSE Act. The California bill would strengthen disclosure requirements for political advertisements. Among other provisions, it requires the top three contributors for any political ad to be identified by name on the ad. Ackerman and Ayres propose a \\"secret donation booth\\", the exact opposite of full disclosure. This system would require that all campaign contributions be anonymously given through a government agency. Their system would give donors a few days to change their minds and withdraw or change the recipient of a donation; it would also add a random time delay to ensure that the recipients of donations could never know for sure the source of the funds they receive.Ackerman and Ayres (2002) =Proposed improvements to the voting system= Approval voting Approval voting is a non-rank-order but graded system in which voters may select all candidates that meet with the voter's approval. The candidate with the highest approval score (i.e. approved by the most voters) wins the election. In elections with three or more candidates, voters may indicate approval of more than one candidate. In 2017, the Colorado legislature considered approval voting. If the bill had passed, Colorado would have been the first state to approve approval voting legislation, but the bill was postponed indefinitely. In 2018, Fargo, North Dakota, passed a local ballot initiative adopting approval voting for the city's local elections, becoming the first United States city and jurisdiction to adopt approval voting.Fargo, North Dakota, Measure 1, Approval Voting Initiative (November 2018), November 7, 2018 BallotpediaOne of America‚Äôs Most Famous Towns Becomes First in the Nation to Adopt Approval Voting , accessed November 7, 2018 Ranked Choice Voting Ranked voting, also called ranked choice voting in the United States, is a ballot design where voters can rank their choices. Popular methods used in some jurisdictions around the world include a system called instant-runoff voting (IRV) to elect one candidate, or a system called the Single transferable vote (STV) to elect multiple candidates. Each voter ranks all (or at least some) of the available options. If one option is ranked first by a majority of voters, it wins. Otherwise, the option(s) obtaining the fewest votes is (are) eliminated, and the options ranked second by those voters get those votes. IRV is being promoted in the U.S. by numerous individuals and organizations. One of these is FairVote, which provides a long list of endorsers of IRV, including President Obama, Senators John McCain and Bernie Sanders, five U.S. Representatives, policy analyst Michael E. Arth, the Green, Libertarian, and Socialist parties, a dozen state chapters of the League of Women Voters, four state chapters of the Democratic Party, the Republican party of Alaska, and many others. It is currently being used in some jurisdictions in the U.S., including the state of Maine. =Abolishing the Electoral College= There have long been concerns about problems with the Electoral College method of selecting the president and vice president. Under this system, the party that wins a plurality in a given state gets all that state's electoral votes. (In Maine and Nebraska, the plurality rule applies to each congressional district.) Modern polling has allowed presidential campaigns to determine which states are \\"swing states\\" (also called \\"battleground states\\") and which will provide near-certain victories for either the Republican or Democratic candidates. The campaigns then increase their chances of winning by focusing primarily on the swing states. This effectively disenfranchises voters in other states to the extent that their concerns differ from those of voters in swing states. Officially abolishing the Electoral College would require amending the U.S. constitution. However, the same effect could be achieved if the Electoral College representatives from states with a majority of the electoral votes were all committed to vote for the presidential slate that achieves a plurality (or the majority after instant-runoff voting): Presidential candidates would then have to compete for votes in all 50 states, not just the typically less than a dozen swing states. This is the idea behind the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. As of November 2019, sixteen states with electoral votes totaling 196 had approved the compact. To take effect it must be approved by states with electoral votes totaling 270, just over half of the 538 current total electoral votes.https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/state-status Webpage of official National Popular Vote Compact. Retrieved November 20, 2019. =Redistricting= In the United States House of Representatives and many other legislative bodies such as city councils, members are elected from districts, whose boundaries are changed periodically through a process known as redistricting. When this process is manipulated to benefit a particular political party or incumbent, the result is known as Gerrymandering. The Open Our Democracy Act of 2017 is a bill designed to end gerrymandering which is currently awaiting scheduling for a vote in the US House of Representatives. Organizations promoting changes in redistricting include FairVote and . =Compulsory voting= Voting is not required of citizens in any state, so elections are decided by those who show up. Politicians target their message at getting their own supporters out to the polls, rather than winning over undecided voters or apathetic citizens. One solution to this problem is compulsory voting. Compulsory voting has been criticized as \\"vaguely un- American\\" but potentially beneficial to democracy. Organizations supporting specific reforms Organizations that support some variant of at least one of the reforms mentioned above include Common Cause, Public Citizen, Move to Amend, People for the American Way, National Popular Vote Inc., Rootstrikers, FairVote, RepresentWomen and Equal Citizens.

Ned works as a pie maker at his restaurant The Pie Hole. He also has the ability to resurrect the dead with a single touch. When private investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) accidentally discovers Ned's ability, the two enter in a partnership: in exchange for Ned using his ability to revive those who have died under suspicious circumstances, Emerson will split any reward money that he receives when the information discovered with the help of Ned's gift allows them to solve the crime. Field Cate portrays young Ned in flashbacks. Ability Ned brings the dead back to life with a single touch, but there are two conditions. First, if he touches a dead person, plant or animal for a second time, it will die forever. Secondly, if the revived remains alive for more than sixty seconds, something or someone else in close proximity will die in its place. Generally, whatever dies is a rough equivalent to what has been revived: a human for a human, an animal for an animal, or a plant for a plant. Revival may suspend the aging process. Ned's dog Digby, having been resurrected by Ned when Ned was nine and Digby was three, remains alive to this day and appears to be in healthy physical condition despite living well past the average amount of dog years. This theory was suspected to be the same for Chuck, but was never proven. Character biography Ned discovered his gift by reviving his dog, Digby, who was run over by a truck. Later that day, Ned also revived his mother after she suddenly died of a brain aneurysm, but soon discovered that his gift had consequences when Chuck's father died next door in exchange. Ned discovered the other effect of his gift later that night, when his mother kissed him goodnight and died a second time. During their respective parents' funerals, Ned and Chuck kissed‚Äîthe first time for both of them. After the funeral, Ned's father dropped him off at the Longborough School for Boys, and never returned or contacted him again except to say that he had moved. Ned continued to test his gift, learning its limitations and rules by such experiments as reviving a jarful of fireflies. After finishing school, Ned opened his own restaurant, The Pie Hole, a restaurant specializing in pies. Ned lives above the restaurant in an apartment, next door to his employee, Olive Snook, who is not aware of his ability. Olive is jealous of Chuck's romance with Ned, but despite her many attempts to attract him, he doesn't reciprocate, though a couple of near-death experiences have prompted suspicions that he may have stronger feelings for her than he initially thought. (Season 1, Episode 5) =Relationship with Chuck= Ned grew up in the village of Coeur d'Coeurs, next door to a girl named Charlotte Charles, nicknamed \\"Chuck\\", on whom he had a childhood crush. During the pilot episode Ned and Emerson hear of a woman being murdered on a cruise ship, with a $50,000 reward for solving the crime. Ned learns that the woman is Chuck, whom he had not seen for almost 20 years. He revives her to ask her who killed her, but discovers that she doesn't know. He is about to touch her but cannot bring himself to do it, allowing her to live instead and inadvertently causing the larcenous funeral director to die. Chuck and Ned soon develop strong feelings for each other and begin a relationship; however, they cannot touch at all, as doing so would cause Chuck to die. However, Ned and Chuck find other ways to express affection: they kiss each other while encased in body bags and while holding a sheet of plastic wrap between their lips. Ned installed a glass window with a rubber glove in his car so she could sit next to him and hold his hand without touching it, and at another point, (Season 1, Episode 4) Chuck holds a prosthetic hand, pretending it's Ned's. With Chuck's presence encouraging him to take a greater role in life, Ned begins to become more involved in Emerson's cases, occasionally going undercover with Emerson and Chuck while searching for further information about the case; on one occasion (Season 2, Episode 8) he has even solved a murder aided only by Olive, Emerson and Chuck being otherwise occupied. Personality Due to Ned's power, he rarely touches people and dislikes physical contact. He also seems to fear any sort of change, at one point saying (Season 1, Episode 7 - Smell of Success) that he prefers to be \\"tightly wound\\" instead of a \\"shapeless mass with room for surprises\\" though Chuck points out that she was a surprise and he made room for her. Wardrobe According to costume designer Robert Blackman, who won a Costume Designers Guild Award and an Emmy for his work on the show, in order to keep Ned at the center of the viewer's attention in a show that features a \\"dizzying backdrop of hyper-saturated colors and storybook locations\\", Blackman limited Ned's wardrobe to \\"solid blacks, grays and whites.\\" Critical reception Lee Pace, the actor who portrays Ned, has received largely positive reviews from critics, who have described him as \\"an immensely likable lead, full of childlike vulnerability and almost palpable longing\\" and \\"endearing but not too cute\\", though he was also described as \\"overly slow-witted\\". Pace has been praised for his acting with Anna Friel, who portrays Chuck; critics have said that \\"[they] are so darn adorable together\\" and that \\"the chemistry between [them] is undeniable\\". Origin Ned was originally going to be a character on Dead Like Me. He was going to contrast with the grim reapers by bringing people back to life. However, Ned never made it into the show so the creator kept the idea until he developed Pushing Daisies.

Capture and conversion  On 24 April 1861, Union sloop-of-war captured Young America in Hampton Roads, Virginia, as that Confederate tug attempted to help blockade-running schooner George M. Smith enter the James River laden with munitions for the Confederacy. Cumberland armed the prize‚Äîa screw steamer built in 1855 at New York City‚Äîand used her as a tender. However, early in June, Young America was ordered to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs to her machinery. She broke down while en route and was towed up the Potomac River by Union steamer .  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Repairs completed, the tug departed Washington, D.C., late in July, bound for Hampton Roads and duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. After patrol and reconnaissance assignments, Young America proceeded to the Baltimore Navy Yard on 13 October 1861 for further repairs and returned to duty in Hampton Roads late in November. On 26 February 1862, the vessel briefly left the Virginia Capes area for Currituck Inlet, North Carolina, to rescue crewmen and stores threatened with capture when Union screw steamer grounded on 25 February. Young America performed invaluable service to the squadron during engagements with CSS Virginia (the former Federal screw frigate Merrimack) on 8 and 9 March 1862. On 8 March, Young America towed to an anchorage off Sewell's Point, Virginia, enabling the frigate to bombard Confederate batteries ashore. On 9 March, she refloated the grounded Union frigate, , and jockeyed the vessel into firing position against Virginia. Later, Young America rescued the crew of Union gunboat when fire destroyed that vessel on 10 March 1862. She also rescued personnel on board Henry Adams, grounded at Nag's Head, North Carolina, on 26 August 1862. Young America left for repairs at the Baltimore Navy Yard in September. Young America returned to Hampton Roads in mid-October 1862, resuming duties as an armed guard tug. On 30 November 1862, and Young America towed monitor to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs but returned to Newport News, Virginia, early in December and, but for occasional runs north, operated in the vicinity of Hampton Roads and the James River through the end of the Civil War. On 7 January 1864, the tug was finally purchased by the Navy from the Boston prize court.  Final operations of the war  Young America was assigned to captured Confederate ram CSS Atlanta for use as a tug on 9 April 1864 and assisted troops under General Wild in repulsing a Confederate attack upon Wilson's Wharf, James River, Virginia, on 24 May 1864. She remained with the James River Squadron, Fourth Division, until the end of the war.  Decommissioning  Young America was decommissioned on 9 June 1865 at the Norfolk Navy Yard and was sold at public auction at New York City on 12 July 1865 to Camden & Amboy Railroad Co.

In 2009, the ABLES program updated its case definition for an Elevated Blood Lead Level to a blood lead concentration equal or greater than 10 micrograms per deciliter (10 ¬µg/dL). This chart shows CDC/NIOSH/ABLES Elevated blood lead level case definition in perspective. The public health objective of the ABLES program is identical to the Occupational Safety and Health objective 7 in Healthy People 2020, which is to reduce the rate of adults (age 16 or older) who have BLLs ‚â• 10 ¬µg/dL. The ABLES program aims to accomplish this objective by providing guidance, technical support, and funding to build state capacity to initiate or improve adult blood lead surveillance programs which can accurately measure trends in adult BLLs and which can effectively target interventions to prevent lead exposures. Impact In the United States, approximately 95% of BLLs ‚â•25 Œºg/dL in adults are work related. Lead exposure occurs mainly in the battery manufacturing, lead and zinc ore mining, and painting and paper hanging industries. In 2008, OSHA updated its National Emphasis Program for Lead to reduce occupational exposures by targeting unsafe conditions or high hazard industries. OSHA utilized national ABLES program data to identify those industries where elevated BLLs indicated a need for increased national focus. State ABLES programs also work with OSHA by sharing lead exposure data, which OSHA then uses to initiate investigations and promote prevention interventions. Over the last 17 years, a 50% decrease in the national prevalence rates of BLL ‚â•25 Œºg/dL has been documented using ABLES surveillance data. In 1994 the rate was 14.0 employed adults per 100,000; in 2010 the rate was reduced to 7.0. In 2010, 40 state ABLES programs that provided data reported 31,081 adults with BLLs ‚â•10 Œºg/dL. Among these, 8,793 had BLLs ‚â•25 Œºg/dL, and 1,388 had BLLs ‚â•40 Œºg/dL. Based on data from 37 reporting states, ABLES established the 2010 baseline rate for Healthy People 2020 objective to reduce adult lead exposure. This 2010 baseline rate for BLLs ‚â•10 ¬µg/dL is 26.4 adults per 100,000 employed adults. Though rates of BLL ‚â•25 Œºg/dL have decreased, the work to prevent elevated BLLs is still far from complete. The ABLES data from 2010 establish that lead exposure remains a national occupational health problem, and that continued efforts to reduce lead exposures are needed. Because BLLs are often not available for many lead- exposed workers (e.g., the workers may not be tested or their tests may not be reported to public health authorities), ABLES data should be considered a low estimate of the true magnitude of elevated adult lead exposures in the United States. Health effects Elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in adults can damage the nervous, hematologic, reproductive, renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Current research continues to find harmful effects in adults at BLLs previously considered harmless, such as decreased renal function associated with BLLs at 5 micrograms per deciliter (Œºg/dL) and lower, and increased risk of hypertension and essential tremor at BLLs below 10 Œºg/dL. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that BLLs among all adults be reduced to <10 ¬µg/dL. OSHA Lead Standards require medical removal from lead exposures only after a construction worker‚Äôs BLL reaches or exceeds 50 ¬µg/dL or a general industry worker‚Äôs BLL reaches or exceeds 60 ¬µg/dL. The geometric mean BLL of all adults in the United States was 1.2 ¬µg/dL in 2009-2010. Workers with elevated blood lead levels In the U.S. the majority of cases are workplace-related. During 2008‚Äì2009, the greatest proportions of adults with elevated BLLs were employed in three main industry sectors:manufacturing, 72.1% in 2008 and 72.3% in 2009; construction, 13.2% in 2008 and 14.4% in 2009; and mining, 6.6% in 2008 and 5.1% in 2009. Industry subsectors with the highest numbers of workers with elevated BLLs were manufacturing of storage batteries, secondary smelting and refining of nonferrous metals, and painting and paper hanging. Industry subsectors with the greatest proportions of adults with BLLs ‚â•40 ¬µg/dL among adults with BLLs ‚â•25 ¬µg/dL were painting and paper hanging; bridge, tunnel, and elevated highway construction; copper foundries; special trade contractors; and heavy construction industries. Program description ABLES state interventions to prevent lead over-exposures include: (1) conducting follow-up interviews with physicians, employers, and workers; (2) investigating work sites; (3) providing technical assistance; (4) providing referrals for consultation and/or enforcement; and (5) developing and disseminating educational materials and outreach programs. ABLES states are required to have a mandatory state requirement that laboratories report blood lead level results to the state health department or designee. The lowest blood lead level to be reported varies from state to state. Lead may be taken home from the workplace on clothes or in cars potentially exposing spouses and children. Children who come in contact with lead-exposed workers should be targeted for blood lead screening. State ABLES programs ABLES‚Äô success is based on its longstanding strategic partnerships with state ABLES programs, federal agencies, and worker affiliated organizations. The NIOSH ABLES program partners with 40 funded states and one state that participates with no ABLES funding: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Overview Just how far back before that their work extended is unclear, but the first artists who appear in recorded history served the Nakatsu clan who lived in Oita Prefecture, on Ky≈´sh≈´, the southernmost part of the Japanese archipelago. (A Japanese Legacy, 18ff) Late in the century they moved to Tokyo. Over the past 150 years the ten leading Yoshida artists, extending through four generations, have used a wide variety of media, styles, and techniques. In this way the family embodies an outline of main developments in modern Japanese art history. Within the family there have been five women artists, in three generations, in effect a case study for the emergence of women in public life and artistic leadership in that country.(Allen et al., 152-3) Finally, the Yoshidas represent an interesting example of the way the Japanese people have often used adoption and arranged marriages to reinforce certain desirable traits associated with a family‚Äôs name. (Modern Japanese Prints, 167)(Skibbe, Yoshida Toshi, 34)  Development  Their artistic trajectory began modestly. Prior to the mid-19th century, the Yoshida artists serving the Nakatsu clan presumably provided work in a traditional Japanese style on silk, paper, or board. But then in the Meiji Period, when the structures of Japanese society were changing radically, a young artist by the name of Kasaburo Haruno changed his name to Kasaburo Yoshida (1861‚Äì1894) when he married Rui Yoshida and was adopted into her family. (Japanese names here are in the Western order, first the individual name, followed by the family name.) Kasaburo shifted from being a traditional Japanese style artist to becoming a pioneer in early Western style art. Whereas he had been serving the clan, he now became an art teacher in one of the schools established by the clan.(Allen et al., 19-20) Then, because Kasaburo and Rui at that time had four daughters and no son, they adopted Hiroshi Ueda who became Hiroshi Yoshida (1876‚Äì1950) as he joined the family and married one of the daughters, Fujio Yoshida (1887‚Äì1987). (A Japanese Legacy, 24, 27) He began with watercolors, but soon became a prize- winning Western-style artist in oils, and late in his career led in a thorough renewal in Japanese woodblock art.(Tadao et al., 178-80)  The Studio and Toshi  The Yoshida Studio was established in 1925. Hiroshi helped Fujio develop into one of the leading modern women artists of the time. (Yoshida Fujio, Foreword) Their first son, T≈çshi Yoshida (1911‚Äì1995), was destined to inherit the Yoshida Studio in Tokyo. He slowly moved beyond the quiet romantic style of his father into a brightly illuminated modern realism and abstraction of the mid-20th century in oils, in woodblock printing, and later in the illustration of his children‚Äôs books. His wife, Kiso Yoshida (1919‚Äì2005), provided a counterpoint with her traditional Japanese works in sand painting (bonseki) and woodblock prints. At the present time, their son Tsukasa Yoshida (1949- ), now director of the Yoshida Hanga Academy, produces surprising modern woodblock prints that blend symbolism and realism. His wife Kiyoko is a performance artist who plays the Celtic harp. (Skibbe, Yoshida Toshi, 43f, 34f, 83) Their daughter, Aya, is a woodblock and mixed media printmaker with a unique, fresh, poetic style of her own. (www.ideagram.co.uk)  Hodaka's broader interests  Parallel to this, Hiroshi and Fujio‚Äôs second son Hodaka Yoshida (1926‚Äì1995) became an artist entirely independent both of his father‚Äôs authority and his aesthetic. The first in the family to focus on abstract art, he began by exhibiting his oils, and then moved to woodblock prints.(Allen et al., 110-11) He was a pioneer in Japan in employing new technologies and techniques, like copper-etching, lithograph, and silkscreen, often with photo- transfer methods, and always in combination with woodblocks. In addition, he gained recognition in the areas of avant-garde poetry, photography, sculpture from various materials, and ceramics. Prints, however, remained his main passion.(Allen et al., 114) He was highly regarded in the world of international biennials, received many prizes, and was awarded two distinguished medals for his art by the Emperor.(Allen et al., 112) (A Japanese Legacy, 112) Hodaka‚Äôs wife Chizuko Yoshida (1924- ), also a nationally and internationally recognized artist, added to the range of modern abstract art in the family.(Allen et al., 178f) That trajectory reached its highest point in the work of their daughter, Ayomi Yoshida (1958- ), who has created distinctly postmodern works, both in the woodblock medium and in large-room installations.(Allen et al., 196-7) Her husband, Bidou Yamaguchi, is a Noh mask carver in the Hosho Noh tradition. Viewed in the context of Japan‚Äôs rich history of art, the Yoshida family is notable for having created such a sustained, and diverse range of fine art that combines the best Japanese aesthetic instincts with a clear modern international appeal.

Bartlett, Hashiguchi Goy≈ç, Kawase Hasui, Yoshida Hiroshi, Kasamatsu Shir≈ç, Torii Kotondo, Ohara Koson, , It≈ç Shinsui, Takahashi Sh≈çtei, Tsuchiya Koitsu and Yamakawa Sh≈´h≈ç are among the artists whose works he published.Miles, Richard and Jennifer Saville, p. 20 Much of his company's stockpile of both prints and their original printing-blocks was destroyed in the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of 1923. In the following years, new versions of many of these prints were created, using re-carved blocks; typically, the re-issued \\"post- quake\\" prints included changes and revisions in the designs. Watanabe exported most of his shin-hanga prints to the United States and Europe due to a lack of Japanese interest. After the close of World War II, his heirs continued the business, which still operates.
