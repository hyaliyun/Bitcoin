At Pier 39, there are shops, restaurants, a video arcade, street performances, the Aquarium of the Bay, virtual 3D rides, and views of California sea lions hauled out on docks on Pier 39's marina. A two- story carousel is one of the pier's more dominant features, although it is not directly visible from the street and sits towards the end of the pier. The family-oriented entertainment and presence of marine mammals make this a popular tourist location for families with kids. The pier is located at the edge of the Fisherman's Wharf district and is close to North Beach, Chinatown, and the Embarcadero. The area is easily accessible with the historic F Market streetcars. From the pier one can see Angel Island, Alcatraz Island, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Bay Bridge. Blue & Gold Fleet's bay cruises leave from Pier 39. History Pier 39 was first developed by entrepreneur Warren Simmons and opened October 4, 1978. On December 22, 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Everitt Aaron Jameson, a 25-year-old former Marine, on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack in the Pier 39 area over Christmas. Sea lions California sea lions have always been present in San Francisco Bay. They started to haul out on docks of Pier 39 in September 1989. Before that they mostly used Seal Rock for that purpose. Ever since September 1989 the number of sea lions on Seal Rock has been steadily decreasing, while their number on Pier 39 has generally increased. Some people speculate that sea lions moved to docks because of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, but the earthquake occurred months after the first sea lions had arrived at Pier 39. It is likely that the sea lions feel safer inside the Bay. The Bay Ecotarium/Bay.org (501c-3) non-profit watershed conservation group in the Bay Area, operates the Sea Lion Center as an extended education arm of the Aquarium of the Bay on Pier #39.http://www.Aquariumofthebay.org Naturalists and education staff interact with visitors and school groups with programs and demonstration activities. According to President & CEO George Jacob, plans are afoot to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the arrival of sea lions in 2020. The sea lions at Pier 39 have become a tourist attraction in their own right Although the reason for their migration to the pier is unclear, the refurbishing of the docks in September 1989 required the removal of all boats from that area, leaving large open spaces for the sea lions to move into. Once the project was completed, boat owners returned, but did their best to navigate around the sea lions; no efforts were made to encourage the new guests to leave. By the end of that year, fewer than a dozen sea lions frequented the docks at Pier 39. By January 1990, their numbers had increased to 150 animals. Owners of the 11 boats docked there began to complain about having to avoid the animals who can weigh up to half a ton, and odor and noise complaints began to pour in. News coverage caught national attention, and the sea lions began to attract tourists. Advice from The Marine Mammal Center was to abandon the docks to the animals, and to relocate the boats elsewhere. Sea lions on Pier 39 Pier 39 and the Pier 39 sign Old Port Gate San Francisco from Forbes Island, pier 39 Although fluctuations in the number of sea lions at Pier 39 are dramatic, as many as 1,701 (Thanksgiving Week, 2009) have been officially reported at one time, many of whom are recognizable to researchers and others, and some of whom have been unofficially named. Volunteers and staff at The Marine Mammal Store and Interpretive Center monitor the sea lion population each day, and educational information is provided to tourists who visit from around the world. Scientists continue to collect information there, adding to knowledge about sea lion health, dietary habits, and behavior. In November 2009 the more than 1,701 (Thanksgiving Week, 2009) sea lions that had lived at the pier began to leave, and by late December 2009 nearly all were gone; a similar flux in population occurs annually, with the animals returning in the spring. Although the reason for their seasonal appearance and departure is not known for certain, according to Jeff Boehm, executive director of the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, \\"Most likely, they left chasing a food source,\\" anchovies and sardines.San Francisco's famous sea lions leave in droves A handful of sea lions did return in February, and by late May several hundred could once again be seen on Pier 39. It remains unknown exactly where they went and why. However, in December 2009, nearly 4,000 sea lions that were identified as members of the California sub-species were seen outside Oregon's Sea Lion Caves, suggesting that they were likely the sea lions from Pier 39. In early 2017, the estimated number of seals ranged from 150 to 600 around the pier. In June and July however, most were expected to leave temporarily for their breeding grounds near the Channel Islands.

Early career He was the son of a baker of Dijon. In 1783, Delaborde joined the Regiment of Cond√© Dragoons as a private.Chandler, p 117 At the outbreak of the French Revolution he joined the 1st Battalion of Volunteers of the C√¥te-d'Or, and passing rapidly through all the junior grades, was made g√©n√©ral de brigade after the combat of Rheinzabern (1793). As chief of the staff, he was present at the siege of Toulon in the same year and promoted g√©n√©ral de division. He was, for a time, governor of Corsica. In 1794 Delaborde served in the War of the Pyrenees against Spain, distinguishing himself at the Baztan Valley on 25 July and at Orbaizeta on 16 October. His next command was on the Rhine. At the head of a division he took part in the celebrated campaigns of 1795-1797, and in 1796 covered g√©n√©ral de division Jean Victor Marie Moreau's right when that general invaded Bavaria at the battles of Neresheim and Emmendingen. In late 1799, Delaborde led a division in actions at Philippsburg and at the French defeat at the battle of Wiesloch as part of g√©n√©ral de division Claude Lecourbe's corps. In the 1800 campaign in southern Germany, Delaborde led a small division in Sainte-Suzanne's corps,Smith, p 178 which was part of Moreau's army. Delaborde was in constant military employment during the Consulate and the early Empire and was made commander of the Legion of Honour in 1804. Peninsula In 1807 he led a division in the Invasion of Portugal with General of Division Jean-Andoche Junot's army. Delaborde received the dignity of count in 1808. Against Sir Arthur Wellesley's English army he fought a skillful and brilliant rear-guard action at the Battle of Roli√ßa. At the Battle of Vimeiro on 21 August 1808, he was wounded while leading his troops in an unsuccessful frontal attack. He commanded a division under Marshal Nicolas Soult at the Battle of Corunna, the Battle of Braga in the First Battle of Porto campaign and the Second Battle of Porto. Later career In 1812 Delaborde was one of Marshal √âdouard Mortier's divisional commanders in the Russian campaign, leading the Young Guard. In early December when Napoleon abandoned his crippled Grand Army, Delaborde was still at Mortier's side.Chandler-Gray, p 320 In 1813, he led the 3rd Division of the Young Guard until wounded in action at Pirna.Chandler, p 118 In the following year he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor and was governor of the Castle of Compi√®gne. He joined Napoleon in the Hundred Days and became Chamberlain and a peer. Marked for punishment by the returning Bourbons, he was sent before a court-martial and only escaped condemnation through a technical flaw in the wording of the charge. The rest of his life was spent in retirement. He was the father of the painter Henri Delaborde. References *Chandler, David. Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars.

Mark and recapture is a method commonly used in ecology to estimate an animal population's size where it is impractical to count every individual.http://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/mark_recapture/mark_recapture.html A portion of the population is captured, marked, and released. Later, another portion will be captured and the number of marked individuals within the sample is counted. Since the number of marked individuals within the second sample should be proportional to the number of marked individuals in the whole population, an estimate of the total population size can be obtained by dividing the number of marked individuals by the proportion of marked individuals in the second sample. The method is most useful when it is not practical to count all the individuals in the population. Other names for this method, or closely related methods, include capture-recapture, capture-mark- recapture, mark-recapture, sight-resight, mark-release-recapture, multiple systems estimation, band recovery, the Petersen method, and the Lincoln method. Another major application for these methods is in epidemiology, where they are used to estimate the completeness of ascertainment of disease registers. Typical applications include estimating the number of people needing particular services (i.e. services for children with learning disabilities, services for medically frail elderly living in the community), or with particular conditions (i.e. illegal drug addicts, people infected with HIV, etc.).  Field work related to mark-recapture  Typically a researcher visits a study area and uses traps to capture a group of individuals alive. Each of these individuals is marked with a unique identifier (e.g., a numbered tag or band), and then is released unharmed back into the environment. A mark- recapture method was first used for ecological study in 1896 by C.G. Johannes Petersen to estimate plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, populations. Sufficient time is allowed to pass for the marked individuals to redistribute themselves among the unmarked population. Next, the researcher returns and captures another sample of individuals. Some individuals in this second sample will have been marked during the initial visit and are now known as recaptures.https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recapture Other animals captured during the second visit, will not have been captured during the first visit to the study area. These unmarked animals are usually given a tag or band during the second visit and then are released. Population size can be estimated from as few as two visits to the study area. Commonly, more than two visits are made, particularly if estimates of survival or movement are desired. Regardless of the total number of visits, the researcher simply records the date of each capture of each individual. The \\"capture histories\\" generated are analyzed mathematically to estimate population size, survival, or movement. When capturing and marking organisms, ecologists need to consider the welfare of the organisms. If the chosen identifier harms the organism, then its behavior might become irregular.  Notation  Let : N = Number of animals in the population : n = Number of animals marked on the first visit : K = Number of animals captured on the second visit : k = Number of recaptured animals that were marked A biologist wants to estimate the size of a population of turtles in a lake. She captures 10 turtles on her first visit to the lake, and marks their backs with paint. A week later she returns to the lake and captures 15 turtles. Five of these 15 turtles have paint on their backs, indicating that they are recaptured animals. This example is (n, K, k) = (10, 15, 5). The problem is to estimate N. N=n*K/k  Lincoln‚ÄìPetersen estimator  The Lincoln‚ÄìPetersen method (also known as the Petersen‚ÄìLincoln index or Lincoln index) can be used to estimate population size if only two visits are made to the study area. This method assumes that the study population is \\"closed\\". In other words, the two visits to the study area are close enough in time so that no individuals die, are born, or move into or out of the study area between visits. The model also assumes that no marks fall off animals between visits to the field site by the researcher, and that the researcher correctly records all marks. Given those conditions, estimated population size is: :\\\\hat{N} = \\\\frac{Kn}{k},  Derivation  It is assumed that all individuals have the same probability of being captured in the second sample, regardless of whether they were previously captured in the first sample (with only two samples, this assumption cannot be tested directly). This implies that, in the second sample, the proportion of marked individuals that are caught (k/K) should equal the proportion of the total population that is marked (n/N). For example, if half of the marked individuals were recaptured, it would be assumed that half of the total population was included in the second sample. In symbols, :\\\\frac{k}{K} = \\\\frac{n}{N}. A rearrangement of this gives :\\\\hat{N}=\\\\frac{Kn}{k}, the formula used for the Lincoln‚ÄìPetersen method.  Sample calculation  In the example (n, K, k) = (10, 15, 5) the Lincoln‚ÄìPetersen method estimates that there are 30 turtles in the lake. : \\\\hat{N} = \\\\frac{Kn}{k} = \\\\frac{10\\\\times 15}{5} = 30  Chapman estimator  The Lincoln‚ÄìPetersen estimator is asymptotically unbiased as sample size approaches infinity, but is biased at small sample sizes. An alternative less biased estimator of population size is given by the Chapman estimator: :\\\\hat{N}_C = \\\\frac{(K+1)(n+1)}{k+1} - 1  Sample calculation  The example (K, n, k) = (10, 15, 5) gives :\\\\hat{N}_C = \\\\frac{(K+1)(n+1)}{k+1} -1= \\\\frac{11\\\\times 16}{6}-1 = 28.3 Note that the answer provided by this equation must be truncated not rounded. Thus, the Chapman method estimates 28 turtles in the lake. Surprisingly, Chapman's estimate was one conjecture from a range of possible estimators: \\"In practice, the whole number immediately less than (K+1)(n+1)/(k+1) or even Kn/(k+1) will be the estimate. The above form is more convenient for mathematical purposes.\\"(see footnote, page 144). Chapman also found the estimator could have considerable negative bias for small Kn/N (page 146), but was unconcerned because the estimated standard deviations were large for these cases.  Confidence interval  An approximate 100(1-\\\\alpha)\\\\% confidence interval for the population size N can be obtained as: K + n - k - 0.5 + \\\\frac{(K-k+0.5)(n-k+0.5)}{(k+0.5)}\\\\exp(\\\\pm z_{\\\\alpha/2}\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_{0.5}), where z_{\\\\alpha/2} corresponds to the 1-\\\\alpha/2 quantile of a standard normal random variable, and \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_{0.5}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{k+0.5}+\\\\frac{1}{K-k+0.5}+\\\\frac{1}{n-k+0.5}+\\\\frac{k+0.5}{(n-k+0.5)(K-k+0.5)}}. It has been shown that this confidence interval has actual coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal 100(1-\\\\alpha)\\\\% level even for small populations and extreme capture probabilities (near to 0 or 1), in which cases other confidence intervals fail to achieve the nominal coverage levels.  Bayesian estimate  The mean value ¬± standard deviation is :N\\\\approx \\\\mu\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu \\\\epsilon} where :\\\\mu=\\\\frac{(K-1)(n-1)}{k-2} for k>2 :\\\\epsilon=\\\\frac{(K-k+1)(n-k+1)}{(k-2)(k-3)} for k>3 A derivation is found here: Talk:Mark and recapture#Statistical treatment.

The capture probability is often defined as a two-variable model, in which f is defined as the fraction of a finite resource devoted to detecting the animal or person of interest from a high risk sector of an animal or human population, and q is the frequency of time that the problem (e.g., an animal disease) occurs in the high-risk versus the low-risk sector. For example, an application of the model in the 1920s was to detect typhoid carriers in London, who were either arriving from zones with high rates of tuberculosis (probability q that a passenger with the disease came from such an area, where q>0.5), or low rates (probability 1-q). It was posited that only 5 out of every 100 of the travelers could be detected, and 10 out of every 100 were from the high risk area. Then the capture probability P was defined as: :P = \\\\frac{5}{10}fq+\\\\frac{5}{90}(1-f)(1-q), where the first term refers to the probability of detection (capture probability) in a high risk zone, and the latter term refers to the probability of detection in a low risk zone. Importantly, the formula can be re-written as a linear equation in terms of f: :P = \\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{10}q-\\\\frac{5}{90}(1-q)\\\\right)f + \\\\frac{5}{90}(1-q). Because this is a linear function, it follows that for certain versions of q for which the slope of this line (the first term multiplied by f) is positive, all of the detection resource should be devoted to the high-risk population (f should be set to 1 to maximize the capture probability), whereas for other value of q, for which the slope of the line is negative, all of the detection should be devoted to the low-risk population (f should be set to 0. We can solve the above equation for the values of q for which the slope will be positive to determine the values for which f should be set to 1 to maximize the capture probability: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{10}q-\\\\frac{5}{90}(1-q)\\\\right) > 0, which simplifies to: :q > \\\\frac{1}{10}. This is an example of linear optimization. In more complex cases, where more than one resource f is devoted to more than two areas, multivariate optimization is often used, through the simplex algorithm or its derivatives.  More than two visits  The literature on the analysis of capture-recapture studies has blossomed since the early 1990s. There are very elaborate statistical models available for the analysis of these experiments.McCrea, R.S. and Morgan, B.J.T. (2014) A simple model which easily accommodates the three source, or the three visit study, is to fit a Poisson regression model. Sophisticated mark-recapture models can be fit with several packages for the Open Source R programming language. These include \\"Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture (secr)\\", \\"Loglinear Models for Capture-Recapture Experiments (Rcapture)\\", and \\"Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (mrds)\\". Such models can also be fit with specialized programs such as MARK or M-SURGE. Other related methods which are often used include the Jolly‚ÄìSeber model (used in open populations and for multiple census estimates) and Schnabel estimators (described above as an expansion to the Lincoln‚ÄìPetersen method for closed populations). These are described in detail by Sutherland.  Integrated approaches  Modelling mark-recapture data is trending towards a more integrative approach,Maunder M.N. (2003) Paradigm shifts in fisheries stock assessment: from integrated analysis to Bayesian analysis and back again. Natural Resource Modeling 16:465‚Äì475 which combines mark-recapture data with population dynamics models and other types of data.

Liu \\"Lao Wu\\" Yijun took his place and, according to Kaiser, went on to become China's first \\"guitar hero.\\" In 1991, the band released its metal/rock version of \\"The Internationale\\" in Chinese. Tang Dynasty rose to fame with their eponymous debut album, released in December 1992. The album officially sold about 2,000,000 authentic copies throughout Asia and abroad, not counting the multitudes more of infringing copies. Their sound is part progressive rock and artistic metal and part traditional Chinese vocal technique. The lyrical poetry and musical arrangements meant to hearken back to the glorious days of ancient Chinese civilization; in particular, the art and cultural epitome of Chinese history as popularly represented by the era of the Tang dynasty. Bassist Zhang Ju died on May 11, 1995, when his motorcycle collided with a truck on the Zizhuqiao freeway overpass in western Beijing. Gu Zhong became bass player, but in August Liu left the band. Co-founder Kaiser Kuo rejoined as guitarist in August 1996. The band's 1998 release Epic was their second album, seven years after their debut record. Kaiser again parted company with Tang Dynasty in June 1999 and later formed another well- recognized metal/rock band, Spring and Autumn (Chunqiu).Kaiser Kuo: Biography Kaiser was replaced by former Iron Kite frontman Yu Yang, and then by young guitar virtuoso Chen Lei in late 2000. After some more member changes, Liu rejoined the group in 2002. Tang Dynasty released their third album Romantic Knight (\\"Langman Qishi\\") in mid-2008, featuring \\"Feng Shan Ji\\" as the album's lead track.Tang Dynasty Band for 2008 New Album Ethnic Prog Art Rock, Culture Express Kaiser appeared in the Western documentary by Sam Dunn, Global Metal, released that same year.Review of Global Metal In January 2009, Liu announced his second departure of the band due to \\"personal reasons\\"; he is now working with an Austrian neo-classical rock artist on an album stated to be out by 2010. Vocalist Ding is currently filling the spot of the second guitarist.http://ent.newssc.org/system/2009/01/17/011480367.shtml In February 2010, Ding Wu announced that the band was preparing for the fourth release that due out later in the year.http://china.org.cn/arts/2010-02/26/content_19481932.htm The next month, Tang Dynasty put out a two-song EP entitled Ups and Downs. The band released their fourth album, Thorn, in November 2013, and toured outside China for the first time in nearly two decades. On February 20, 2019, Tang Dynasty revealed on Weibo that lead guitarist Chen Lei had been replaced by Liu Jingwei and Fu Dalong, again making the band a five-piece lineup.

In pagan contexts, the principal meaning was \\"oracles\\", while Jewish and Christian writings used logia in reference especially to \\"the divinely inspired Scriptures\\". A famous and much-debated occurrence of the term is in the account by Papias of Hierapolis on the origins of the canonical Gospels. Since the 19th century, New Testament scholarship has tended to reserve the term logion for a divine saying, especially one spoken by Jesus, in contrast to narrative, and to call a collection of such sayings, as exemplified by the Gospel of Thomas, logia. Ancient use In pagan usage, logion was used interchangeably with chresmos (œáœÅŒ∑œÉŒºœåœÇ) and other such terms in reference to oracles, the pronouncements of the gods obtained usually through divination. The Septuagint adapted the term logion to mean \\"Word of God\\", using it especially for translating (\\"imrah\\"). For example, at Psalms 12:6, the Hebrew text reads: ◊ê÷¥÷Ω◊û÷≤◊®÷π÷£◊ï◊™ ◊ô÷∞◊î◊ï÷∏◊î÷Æ ◊ê÷≤◊û÷∏◊®÷π÷™◊ï◊™ ◊ò÷∞◊î÷π÷´◊®÷π÷•◊ï◊™. The equivalent passage from the Septuagint (numbered as Psalms 11:7 -- see here for explanation of numbering), reads: œÑ·Ω∞ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒ± ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒ± ·ºÅŒ≥ŒΩŒ¨. The King James version reads: \\"The words of the Lord are pure words.\\" In Philo, however, the entire Old Testament was considered the Word of God and thus spoken of as the logia, with any passage of Scripture, whatever its length or content, designated a logion; the sense of the word is the same as in the Septuagint, but applied broadly to inspired Scriptures. In this sense logia is used four times in the New Testament; ; ; . and often among the Church Fathers, who also counted the New Testament books among inspired Scripture. From logia is distinguished a related word logoi ('), meaning simply \\"words\\", often in contrast to pr√°xeis ('), meaning \\"deeds\\". Words spoken by Jesus are consistently designated as logoi in ancient documents. Papias of Hierapolis Papias of Hierapolis composed around AD 100 a work, now lost, entitled Exegesis of the Dominical Logia, which Eusebius quotes as an authority on the origins of the Gospels of Mark and Matthew.Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3.39.14‚Äì16.Translations from On Mark, Papias cites John the Elder: And the brief excerpt regarding Matthew says: So, Papias uses logia in his title and once in regard to each Gospel. Eusebius, who had the complete text before him, understood Papias in these passages as referring to the canonical Gospels. In the 19th century, however, scholars began to question whether this tradition actually refers to those texts, especially in the case of what Papias ascribes to Matthew. In 1832, Schleiermacher, believing Papias to be writing before these Gospels were regarded as inspired Scripture and before the formation of any New Testament canon, argued that logia could not be understood in its usual sense but must rather be interpreted as utterances ('), and that Papias was referring to collections of the sayings of Jesus. Soon afterwards, a new theory of the Synoptic problem emerged, the two-source hypothesis, positing that the double tradition in Matthew and Luke derived from a lost document containing mostly sayings of Jesus. Holtzmann's defense of this theory, which has dominated scholarship ever since, seized upon Schleiermacher's thesis and argued that Papias was attesting a ' (logia-source), which he designated Œõ (lambda). When later scholars abandoned the evidence of Papias as an argument, this hypothetical source came to be more neutrally designated as Q (for '), but the reinterpretation of the word logia already had firmly taken hold in scholarship. Modern scholars are divided on what Papias actually meant, especially with regard to the logia he ascribes to Matthew, and what underlying historical facts this testimony alludes to. Some see this logia as referring still to the Old Testament, thus a collection of prophecies and prooftexts regarding Jesus. Others still hold that Papias is speaking of a now-lost collection of sayings, noting that canonical gospel of Matthew is especially focused on the sayings of Jesus. Others, noting how in the account of Mark, the parallel to \\"things said or done by the Lord\\" requires the meaning of logia at least to be extended to deeds, see Papias as referring to some account more closely resembling the canonical Gospels. Still others hold that Papias was indeed referring to the canonical Gospels as we know them‚Äîarguably even using logia in the sense of Scriptures, and \\"dominical logia\\" as an early term for \\"Gospels\\"‚Äîand that the account of Papias thus amounts to our earliest testimony of their existence and recognition. Another point of controversy surrounds the statement that Matthew wrote in the \\"Hebrew dialect\\", which in the Greek could refer to either Hebrew or Aramaic. Some, noting that \\"dialect\\" could mean not only language but also, in a technical sense, style, understand Papias to be referring to a Greek language gospel but written in a Semitic style. Others hold that Matthew wrote a Semitic-language work first, before producing a Greek recension recognized as canonical Matthew. Still others hold that whatever lost work Matthew allegedly wrote‚Äîwhether a collection of sayings, the Gospel according to the Hebrews, or a prototype of canonical Matthew‚Äîwas composed in Semitic but translated freely into Greek by others. And some regard Papias as simply mistaken and telling nothing of value. Gospel of Thomas The 19th century saw a consensus gather around the two-source hypothesis, positing a hypothetical collection of sayings, along with a growing use of the term logia‚Äîwhatever Papias had actually meant by it‚Äîto refer to such a collection of sayings of Jesus. It was in this context that the first fragments of the Gospel of Thomas were discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897, containing otherwise-unknown sayings of Jesus. Although the term logia does not occur in the papyri in any form, the editors saw this discovery as an example of the very sort of logia hypothesized and accordingly titled their publication Logia Iesu: Sayings of Our Lord. Later finds shed more light on the work, now identified as the Gospel of Thomas condemned by several Church Fathers, which is a series of sayings attributed to Jesus, many found nowhere else, with no narrative framework. Although Grenfell and Hunt soon retracted their inappropriate designation of the text as logia in favor of logoi, it has since become standard to speak of the composition as logia, and of each individual saying as a logion, numbered in most division schemes from 1 to 114. Modern use This sense of logion as \\"something Jesus said\\" is now in wide use among scholars. The term is sometimes applied to a saying of Jesus contained in any of the canonical Gospels, but it is especially used for any agraphon‚Äîa saying of Jesus not otherwise attested. An oft-cited example is : \\"And remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'\\" See also * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1 the Logia Iesous * Agrapha * Development of the New Testament canon * Q document * Aramaic primacy * Freer logion References Category:Christian terminology Category:Gnosticism Category:New Testament Category:Sayings of Jesus Category:Synoptic problem ","title":"Logia"},{"id":"1507743","text":"Asobi Seksu was an American shoegaze/dream pop band based in New York City. Their music used a textured and effects-heavy vocal and guitar sound. The band primarily consisted of Yuki Chikudate (vocals, keyboards) and James Hanna (guitar, vocals). History Forming in 2001, the band was originally known as Sportfuck, and issued an EP under that name that year. The band then changed their name to Asobi Seksu, from the Japanese ÈÅä„Å≥„Çª„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ (asobi sekkusu), \\"play sex\\". The original lineup consisted of Chikudate, Hanna, drummer Keith Hopkin and bassist Glenn Waldman. Hanna and Hopkin, with bassist Haji, had previously been members of the New York City space rock trios Three Cornered Season and Theta Wave State. Asobi Seksu's full-length self-titled debut album was self-released in 2002, and later re-released on the Friendly Fire Recordings label on May 18, 2004. Hopkin and Waldman left after touring for the album. Regrouping with a new rhythm section of Haji (bass) and Bryan Greene (drums), they recorded their second album, Citrus, in New York City's Gigantic Studios with producer Chris Zane. It was released on May 30, 2006 by Friendly Fire Recordings. By the time the band recorded their first live album, Spaceland Presents: At the Echo October 6th, 2006, Greene had been replaced by Mitch Spivak. The album was issued on October 31, 2006 by Spaceland Recordings. and reissued in 2007 by KUFALA Recordings. One Little Indian Records signed the band in Europe and re-released the band's first two albums in 2007, with Citrus reaching No. 21 on the UK Indie Chart that year. On November 20, 2007, Asobi Seksu released \\"Stay Awake\\" as a stand-alone single on the Gigantic Music label, backed by a cover of \\"Then He Kissed Me\\" by the Crystals. Another cover, of the Ramones' \\"Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)\\", was released by One Little Indian as a single on December 10, 2007. Following the departures of Haji and Spivak, Chikudate and Hanna remained as Asobi Seksu's core, with the live band including drummer Ben Shapiro (later of Scary Mansion) and bassist Billy Pavone. The band released another live album, Acoustic at Olympic Studios, on February 8, 2009 as a tour-exclusive CD. Recorded as a duo in November 2008, it featured new acoustic versions of the band's back catalog as well as unique tracks. Retitled as Rewolf, it was released worldwide in November 2009. On February 17, 2009, the band (Chikudate and Hanna, joined by drummer Gunnar Olsen) released their third studio album, Hush on the Polyvinyl Record Co. label. The album was released to generally positive reviews, with many critics citing a shift in the band's shoegaze direction to a mellower dream pop sound.[ AllMusic ((( Hush > Overview )))] Drummer Larry Gorman, formerly of Orange 9mm, Glassjaw and Head Automatica, joined Asobi Seksu in 2009. The band's fourth studio album, Fluorescence, was released on February 14, 2011. The lineup included Chikudate, Hanna, Gorman and Pavone. On November 23, 2012, for Record Store Black Friday, the band released Asobi Seksu x Boris, a split EP with Boris on which Asobi Seksu covered that band's \\"Farewell\\". The band announced an indefinite hiatus on September 30, 2013, via their Facebook page. On July 23, 2014, Asobi Seksu announced that they would reunite for a one-off show opening for Slowdive in Boston on October 26, 2014, at Slowdive's request. Other projects In May 2009, Chikudate released a collaborative single with Pocket called \\"Sampo\\". The track included remixes by Mux Mool, Blue Eyes and Craig Wedren. In 2014, Hanna and Gorman formed the band Youth Worship, releasing an EP in 2014 and a full-length album in 2015. Song appearances in media Asobi Seksu's songs have been featured in various television shows, including The L Word and the British television series Skins. The song \\"Layers\\" from Hush was also featured in an episode of Ugly Betty. Their non-album track \\"Stay Awake\\" was included on the Adult Swim compilation album Warm & Scratchy in May 2007. Their song \\"Ramen Girl\\" was the closing credits song for the 2008 film The Ramen Girl. The band provided music for So Yong Kim's 2007 film In Between Days and contributed an original score for Kim's 2009 film Treeless Mountain. The song \\"Thursday\\" was featured in The Exploding Girl, produced and edited by Kim and directed by her husband Bradley Rust Gray. Kim also directed the music video for the song. \\"Thursday\\" was also used in LateRooms' 2012 advertisement and in the trailer for the 2014 film Affluenza.

This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer). Overview of the Domain Name System A Domain Name System server translates a human-readable domain name (such as \`example.com\`) into a numerical IP address that is used to route communications between nodes. Normally if the server does not know a requested translation it will ask another server, and the process continues recursively. To increase performance, a server will typically remember (cache) these translations for a certain amount of time. This means if it receives another request for the same translation, it can reply without needing to ask any other servers, until that cache expires. When a DNS server has received a false translation and caches it for performance optimization, it is considered poisoned, and it supplies the false data to clients. If a DNS server is poisoned, it may return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to another computer (often an attacker's). Cache poisoning attacks Normally, a networked computer uses a DNS server provided by an Internet service provider (ISP) or the computer user's organization. DNS servers are used in an organization's network to improve resolution response performance by caching previously obtained query results. Poisoning attacks on a single DNS server can affect the users serviced directly by the compromised server or those serviced indirectly by its downstream server(s) if applicable. To perform a cache poisoning attack, the attacker exploits flaws in the DNS software. A server should correctly validate DNS responses to ensure that they are from an authoritative source (for example by using DNSSEC); otherwise the server might end up caching the incorrect entries locally and serve them to other users that make the same request. This attack can be used to redirect users from a website to another site of the attacker's choosing. For example, an attacker spoofs the IP address DNS entries for a target website on a given DNS server and replaces them with the IP address of a server under their control. The attacker then creates files on the server under their control with names matching those on the target server. These files usually contain malicious content, such as computer worms or viruses. A user whose computer has referenced the poisoned DNS server gets tricked into accepting content coming from a non-authentic server and unknowingly downloads the malicious content. This technique can also be used for phishing attacks, where a fake version of a genuine website is created to gather personal details such as bank and credit/debit card details. Variants In the following variants, the entries for the server would be poisoned and redirected to the attacker's name server at IP address . These attacks assume that the name server for is . To accomplish the attacks, the attacker must force the target DNS server to make a request for a domain controlled by one of the attacker's nameservers. Redirect the target domain's name server The first variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the name server of the attacker's domain to the name server of the target domain, then assigning that name server an IP address specified by the attacker. DNS server's request: what are the address records for ? subdomain.attacker.example. IN A Attacker's response: Answer: (no response) Authority section: attacker.example. 3600 IN NS ns.target.example. Additional section: ns.target.example. IN A w.x.y.z A vulnerable server would cache the additional A-record (IP address) for , allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire domain. Redirect the NS record to another target domain The second variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the nameserver of another domain unrelated to the original request to an IP address specified by the attacker. DNS server's request: what are the address records for ? subdomain.attacker.example. IN A Attacker's response: Answer: (no response) Authority section: target.example. 3600 IN NS ns.attacker.example. Additional section: ns.attacker.example. IN A w.x.y.z A vulnerable server would cache the unrelated authority information for 's NS-record (nameserver entry), allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire domain. Prevention and mitigation Many cache poisoning attacks against DNS servers can be prevented by being less trusting of the information passed to them by other DNS servers, and ignoring any DNS records passed back which are not directly relevant to the query. For example, versions of BIND 9.5.0-P1 and above perform these checks. Source port randomization for DNS requests, combined with the use of cryptographically secure random numbers for selecting both the source port and the 16-bit cryptographic nonce, can greatly reduce the probability of successful DNS race attacks. However, when routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices perform network address translation (NAT), or more specifically, port address translation (PAT), they may rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. When modifying source ports, PAT devices may remove source port randomness implemented by nameservers and stub resolvers. Secure DNS (DNSSEC) uses cryptographic digital signatures signed with a trusted public key certificate to determine the authenticity of data. DNSSEC can counter cache poisoning attacks. In 2010 DNSSEC was implemented in the Internet root zone servers., but needs to be deployed on all top level domain servers as well. The DNSSEC readiness of these is shown in the list of Internet top-level domains. As of 2020, all of the original TLDs support DNSSEC, as do country code TLDs of most large countries, but many country code TLDs still do not. This kind of attack can be mitigated at the transport layer or application layer by performing end-to-end validation once a connection is established. A common example of this is the use of Transport Layer Security and digital signatures. For example, by using HTTPS (the secure version of HTTP), users may check whether the server's digital certificate is valid and belongs to a website's expected owner. Similarly, the secure shell remote login program checks digital certificates at endpoints (if known) before proceeding with the session. For applications that download updates automatically, the application can embed a copy of the signing certificate locally and validate the signature stored in the software update against the embedded certificate.

The term So-tai (Êìç‰Ωì) is actually the opposite of the Japanese word for exercise: Tai-so (‰ΩìÊìç). Dr. Hashimoto conceived Sotai as an antidote to the forceful and regimented exercises of Japan, that anyone could practice easily to restore balance and health. Sotai is different from regular exercise because it distinguishes between balanced movements that are natural and beneficial and those that are unnatural and cause strains and physical distortions. The aim of Sotai is to help the body restore and maintain its natural balance. Dr. Hashimoto developed a model of treatment based on restoring structural balance that is claimed to work with the breath and movements toward comfort (or away from pain). He developed Sotai Therapy from traditional East Asian medicine (acupuncture, moxibustion, bone setting (Sekkotsu), Seitai JutsuHashimoto (1983) about the reverse motion treatment, developed in the 1920s by Michio Takahashi (founder of Seitai Jutsu: http://yomi.mobi/egate/Seitai/a)) in concert with his knowledge of modern medicine. Sotai Therapy is intended to be a method of neuromuscular reeducation and unwinding muscular holding patterns. According practitioners, Sotai Therapy balances the nervous and muscular systems.Hashimoto & Kawakami, 1983 Its central principle is backtracking movement or \\"reverse-motion\\" treatment. The idea is that structural distortions can be returned to a more normal condition by moving the body in the comfortable direction. Using the effects of an isometric contraction followed by a sudden relaxation (post-isometric relaxation) can normalise the strained condition.According to neurophysiological knowledge, a contracted myofibril will lose its holding pattern during the post-isometric phase of movement.  Philosophy  Dr. Hashimoto held that Sotai was not just a system of exercises or a method of therapy, but that it was part of a deeper broader principle that embraced all of life. Health is the natural result of right living, and its improvement and maintenance is the responsibility of each individual. Most human beings go through life without much awareness of the essential processes of life until there is some dysfunction or disease. These essential functions are breathing, eating/drinking, moving, and thinking. These four functions are interrelated and help keep our body in balance or otherwise cause imbalance and disease. Most imbalances begin small and barely perceptible but gradually increase to eventually produce pain, physical distortion, and organic disease. People in this modern age need to re-connect with the natural principles of life, (the interrelationship of breath, ingestion, movement, and thought) that is a unique combination for each person. Sotai is intended as a system to help re-establish a natural and effortless relationship with our environment and engender balance, health, and wellbeing. The Sotai theory follows the guideline that stiffness or pain should be regarded as a sort of stop light: if a movement hurts, the patient should stop doing it. According to the theory, Sotai(-h≈ç) is a guide to determine which movements are harmful and which are helpful (therapeutic).  Four Functions of Life  Most human beings go through life without much awareness of the essential processes of life until there is some dysfunction or disease. These essential functions are breathing, eating/drinking, moving, and thinking. These four functions are interrelated and help keep our body in balance or otherwise cause imbalance and disease. Most imbalances begin small and barely perceptible but gradually increase to eventually produce pain, physical distortion, and organic disease. People in this modern age need to re-connect with the natural principles of life, (the interrelationship of breath, ingestion, movement, and thought) that is unique combination for each person. Sotai is a system that helps re-establish a natural and effortless relationship with our environment and engender balance, health, and wellbeing. As to the first function breathing, essential to life, Dr. Hashimoto advised abdominal breathing. Breathing is the most vital function in our life, which cannot be interrupted for more than a few minutes. It follows that the healthier one is, the deeper one's breathing. To this end, Dr. Hashimoto advocated abdominal massage and abdominal breathing every night before going to sleep. About the second function of eating/drinking, or diet, Dr. Hashimoto advocated a simple macrobiotic diet. Nevertheless, he cautioned against being too strict about one's diet. He suggested learning which foods were most nourishing and what was best for one's own health. The most important thing in diet, Dr. Hashimo maintained, was not what or how much food was eaten, but how well the food that was eaten was chewed and digested. Regarding the function of movement, Sotai advocates natural movement or aiming for ease and effortlessness as much as possible. The aim of Sotai is to release abnormal tension, which can eventually lead to functional and structural problems. All interventions, be they small or large, are aimed at facilitating the body's recovery of functional and structural integrity. This is accomplished not by force, but by inviting the body to relax, breathe, and move in the direction of ease. As to the last function of thinking, unique to human beings, Dr. Hashimoto regarded positive thinking to be no less essential to health than breathing. This is achieved by preeminently directing our thoughts towards those things that are pleasant, beautiful, and delightful. One need not pay any attention to depressing things and events that cannot be changed. Dr. Hashimoto said, \\"Our thoughts are the steering wheel of our destiny.\\"  Basic Principles of Natural Movement  Among the abovementioned four functions of life, Sotai works specifically with movement and breathing. In respect to movement Dr. Hashimoto set out some basic principles of natural movement, which support balance and health (in contrast to those movements that cause strain and injury and compromise health). These basic principles of natural movement have broad implications on all types of movement. The movement chain According to Hashimoto the law of the reciprocal effect has not only validity within the model of the four health factors: it refers to every kind of movement. A movement never (!) takes place in one segment only.Hayashi in his Reader, 2nd ed., pg. 4, 2003 It is not detached from the remaining body! It spreads out as a kind of a chain starting from one link going to the adjoining and finally over the whole body. In Sotai it is said that the whole organism is always involved in performance. Following this idea, one could regard the birth of a local hardening as the result of a process which works in the whole organism (see: Philosophy). According to this vision, one could regard a prolapsed disc as an appearance at those places within the chain which are not permeable, where the forces are held, leading to a collapse. Doshin (self-detection) According to Hayashi, Sotaiho is not a curation treatment in the usual sense. Sotaiho requires the co-operation of the affected person.Hayashi in his Reader, 2nd ed., pg. 30, 2003 This is meant as a sort \\"listening to yourself\\" during the treatment. Hashimoto claims that therapists, doctors and medications cannot heal. He states that this can only be done by nature. So it is an essential part of Sotai therapy to hunt up independently false positions of the several joints and to understand them as a cause of the problem. While Dr. Hashimoto's work has concentrated in essence upon the partner's work, it was Dr. Sato who had strongly developed the Self- Sotai.Hayashi, 2006 From his point of view it belongs to an extensive therapy to train an affected person in self-exercises. Practitioners claim that if the affected person has understood the Sotai idea once, he can extend it to all areas. They say that this understanding also includes the idea that there is an optimal degree of the pleasant. Too much of it is again harmful: e.g., a piece of cake may be probably tasty, however, a whole cake causes certainly stomachaches.  Meridian tendons  In the traditional eastern medicine (TEAM) one knows about muscular leading roads which are very similar to the course of the associated meridians. They are named 'meridian tendons'. For didactic reasons, the 'tendon' of the gallbladder meridian is chosen: this meridian tendon runs down the outside of the body and connects the temples with the outer area of the foot. In between there are several interfaces: :*on height of the fibula's head :*at the level of the sacrum :*on height of the waist-line :*in the shoulder :*in the area of the temple. Practitioners frequently have to work on problems within this tendon.Meridian tendons They claim that many loins complaints stand in connection with a disturbance of this chain. According to Dr. Masunaga (founder of Zen Shiatsu), who has assigned psychological functions to the Functional Circles, the meridian of the gallbladder stands on behalf for the function of short-time decisions: \\"Do I go to the right or to the left?\\" In the bioenergetic concept of Alexander Lowen, it is said that emotional habits are incorporated in postural patterns. Probably Dr. Hashimoto's approach transfers this theory to the level of the movement chains: all kind of (movement) habits will be reflected within the meridian tendons. E.g., everybody knows the situation in which one could not make a proper decision, to do something somehow and, nevertheless, also again not. According to Masunaga the appropriate movement would be a kind of twist, an unclear movement which leads to one side, but also to the other side. According to Masunaga's idea, such samples will establish as strained conditions in the gallbladder's meridian tendon. According to Kawakami one could state a change of the muscle proteins at microscopic level, called \\"strain\\". Via neuronal feedback mechanisms the vegetative nervous system is affected, which has an influence on the metabolism of the internal organs. It is possible that through this way disturbances in the organ system could be caused. To speak to Manakassee Manakas book: Chasing the dragon's tail words, a correction in the software - in this case the muscle apparatus - could cause changes in the somatic condition of the related segment.Kawakami claims that orthosympathical dystension is generated via muscular hypertonus (Hashimoto & Kawakami, pg. 182, German edition of Balance and health through natural movements, ch. \\"Die t√§gliche Gesundheitspflege\\" (daily health hygiene) )  Therapy  According to Hashimoto the pelvis is the centre of all movements. Goal of therapy is to synchronize movements of hands and feet with those of the pelvic girdle. Facilitate the lower abdomen According to HayashiHayashi in his Reader, 3rd ed., pg. 35ff, 2009 with this technique an exercise is presented with which all basic treatments are started practically. Palpating the popliteal fossa one can feal hardenings of the local tendons by moving one's fingers. The technique will be executed on the more reactive side. Here the affected person should raise his forefoot and shift his weight gently towards the heel. If both sides are reactive the technique will be done on both sides. The practitioner puts on his hand lightly to strengthen the tension within the movement chain positively. After three to five seconds the affected person should relax suddenly, afterwards the exercise will be repeated three to four times. Applying this technique facilitates the connection of the center of the foot with the lower abdomen. Right or left? The following technique probably adjusts the tension in the diaphragmAlice Schaarschuch developed in the 1920s a therapy to integrate postural and respirative patterns. Her method was further developed by her student Hedi Haase in the 1970s, called 'L√∂sungstherapie nach Schaarschuch- Haase'. In their method there is a description of a supine rotation stretch to release tension of the diafragm. This position seems to be quite similar to the here described Sotai exercise and in the gall-bladder's meridian tendonAccording to Schulze this exercise releases tension of the gall- bladder's meridian tendon (http://www.physiotherapeuten.de/index.html?http://www.physiotherapeuten.de/pt/archiv/2010/pt04/a_pt_10_04_lehre03_fort- weiterbildung.html) as well. If for example, the trunk rotation is unpleasant to the left, the affected person turns to the right, to the painless side. Starting from the place at which the movement is still pleasant the practitioner initiates the movement. Close to the end of the movement the practitioner will build up a light resistance which ends in an isometric contraction. The final point of the exercise is where the segment can be adjusted on an optimal degree. Mostly it lies exactly opposite facing the starting point. After three to five seconds the affected person should relax suddenly, afterwards the exercise will be repeated three to four times.

It is done by taking two or more strands of yarn that each have a twist to them and putting them together. The strands are twisted together, in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. When just the right amount of twist is added, this creates a balanced yarn, one which has no tendency to twist upon itself. Almost all store-bought yarns are balanced, plied yarns. The word ply derives from the French verb plier,Collins Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd Edition, London, 1986, p.1181 \\"to fold\\", from the Latin verb plico, from the ancient Greek verb œÄŒªŒ≠Œ∫œâ.Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928, p.421 A two-ply is thus a yarn plied from two strands, a six-ply is one from six strands, and so on. Most commercial yarns are more than a two ply. Embroidery floss is generally a six-ply yarn, for example. The creation of two-ply yarn requires two separate spools of singles and either a lazy kate or something to hold the spools in place. On a wheel, two-ply is created by taking two spools of singles, placing them on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the spool attached to the wheel, and spinning the wheel in the opposite direction to that in which the singles were spun, while also feeding the yarn onto the spool on the wheel. On a drop spindle, two-ply is created by placing the spools on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the drop spindle, holding equal lengths of singles together and dropping the spindle. The weight of the drop spindle combined with the twist in the singles, causes the drop spindle to turn in the opposite direction that the singles were twisted in until the two singles are plied together. Plying handspun yarns Making a three-ply yarn using bobbins on a lazy kate. When hand-spinning, there are two common ways to ply a balanced yarn: regular and Navajo. When spinning fleece into yarn, the fleece must be scoured and vegetable matter removed. The fleece is carded or combed and then spun into singles. These singles are used to create the finished yarn in a process known as plying. The purpose of plying singles is to strengthen them so that they do not break while knitting or crocheting them. Most spinners (who use spinning wheels) ply from bobbins. This is easier than plying from balls because there is less chance for the yarn to become tangled and knotted if it is simply unwound from the bobbins. So that the bobbins can unwind freely, they are put in a device called a Lazy Kate, or sometimes simply kate. The simplest lazy kate consists of wooden bars with a metal rod running between them. Most hold three or four bobbins. The bobbin sits on the metal rod. Other lazy kates are built with devices that create an adjustable amount of tension, so that if the yarn is jerked, a whole bunch of yarn is not wound off, then wound up again in the opposite direction. Some spinning wheels come with a built-in lazy kate. Regular plying Diagram showing S and Z twist Regular plying consists of taking 2 or more singles and twisting them together, the opposite way. This can be done on either a spinning wheel or a spindle. The most important thing to remember though is that the twist must go the opposite direction. If in spinning the single the wheel was spinning clockwise (which is called a \\"Z\\" twist, as on any given side the fibres appear to cross diagonally in the same direction as the diagonal of a \\"Z\\"), in order to ply it the wheel must spin counter-clockwise (an \\"S\\" twist). This is because otherwise you are not balancing the twist, just twisting it more. The concept is similar to when a heavily twisted piece of yarn is folded, and it twists up on itself. It is most common for singles to be spun with a \\"Z\\" twist, and then plied with an \\"S\\" twist. How the singles are held to keep them separate When plying, the singles are kept separate, either with the fingers or with a tool. This tool can be anything from the top of a salt dispenser, and the singles threaded through the holes, or a specially carved piece of wood with holes in it. The singles are kept separate to ensure that they do not get tangled and so the tension can be controlled. Navajo plying Navajo plying (also known as chain plying) consists of making large loops, similar to crocheting. Only one single is necessary, and if the single is already dyed, this technique allows it to be plied without ruining the color scheme. The spinner first makes an 8-inch (200 mm) loop through the loop on the end of the leader. (A leader is the string left on the bobbin, which the new yarn is spun from.) Then the spinner starts spinning all three strands together in the opposite direction than that they were spun in. When only 2 to remain of the loop, a new, 7-inch (180 mm) loop of yarn is pulled through the loop, and spinning continues. This process is repeated until the yarn is all plied. This technique allows the spinner to try to match up thick and thin spots in the yarn, thus making for a smoother end product.Video of the Navajo plying technique at The Joy of Handspinning Machined yarns Machines that ply yarn use the 'regular' method mentioned above. The main difference is that gears control the intake, making sure that the strands all have the same tension and the same length. Other than that, the process for plying is exactly the same as when hand done. Novelty yarns Many novelty yarns make use of special plying techniques to gain their special effects. By varying the tension in the strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting yarn spirals. Another example is boucl√©, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the other yarn while plying.

Ahwatukee forms the southernmost portion of Phoenix, and is considered part of the East Valley region of the Phoenix metropolitan area.  History  Prior to the area's development into the community it is known today, the name \\"Ahwatukee\\" referred, at times, to a since-demolished house that sat in an area near Sequoia Trails and Appaloosa Drive, west of the Warner-Elliot Loop.  Beginnings  At least two major thoroughfares in today's Ahwatukee are named after people who claimed lands in the area, in the decades following the signing of the Homestead Act in 1862. Warner Road was named after Samuel Warner of Kansas, while Elliot Road was named after Reginald Elliott of California. Both claimed lands in an area now known as Tempe. A third man, Arthur Hunter, claimed land within an area now known as Ahwatukee. The street known today as 48th Street was, for a time, named Hunter Drive, after Arthur Hunter. Hunter is rumored to have, in the 1940s, disassembled and buried in the Ahwatukee desert a Studebaker auto purportedly owned by Al Capone.  Ahwatukee ranch  One of the first houses in the area was built by Dr. William Van Bergen Ames, who co-founded Northwestern University's now-closed Dental School. The house was built on a piece of land measuring over , which was purchased for $4 an acre. At the time, the Chandler Arizonan newspaper called the house, built in the foothills of the South Mountain, \\"unmatched in scope and size\\". The house was noted to be a winter residence, designed by prominent Phoenix architect Lester Mahoney, with construction starting in 1921. The house was given the name \\"The Mystic House\\" by the Chandler Arizonan, due to its cost, size, and isolated location. The Ames, however, called it Casa de Sue√±os. They moved into the house on Thanksgiving of 1921, but Dr. Ames died suddenly in February 1922. Ames' wife continued to spend her winters at the house until her death in 1933. Following Ames' wife's death, the Ames' property in Ahwatukee was willed to St. Luke's Hospital. The property was bought by Helen Brinton in 1935, who gave the house (and eventually the area) the name it is known by today (as explained below). Brinton died in 1960, and the house was demolished in 1979.  Proving grounds  In 1946, the International Harvester Company rented land from a United States Army tank testing facility located west of today's Lakewood community, for use as truck and heavy equipment proving grounds. The proving grounds eventually grew to over . The grounds were designed to stress-test trucks and heavy equipment with, among other things, a test track, dirt tracks, a special testing area with 20 to 60% grade, service shops, and a runway for company executives. The grounds were sold to a property development company in 1983, due to a combination of economic issues, labor union problems, and a patent infringement judgement against the company. The area is now a part of The Foothills and Club West developments.  Development  Development of Ahwatukee began in 1970, when Presley Development Company, led by Randall Presley, bought of land. The land included Ahwatukee Ranch, then owned by a land syndicate led by an Arizona State University English professor, as well as land owned by a local moving and storage firm. Presley originally planned for the area to be a retirement community, but later devised a mix of retirement living, family living, and light commercial zoning for the area. Presley Development was noted to have a role in Ahwatukee eventually becoming a part of Phoenix, instead of neighboring Chandler or Tempe, through a handshake deal with Maricopa County Supervisor Bob Stark, who was also an attorney with Presley Development, made with Mayor of Phoenix John D. Driggs. However, Chandler and Tempe officials were noted to have refused offers of annexing Ahwatukee. Phoenix annexed the area in stages, from 1980 to 1987. It has been suggested that Phoenix's annexation of Ahwatukee had, to a degree, affected Tempe's future development. Plans for Ahwatukee were approved by Maricopa County in November 1971, and 17 model homes were opened in an area near 50th Street and Elliot Road in 1973. In the same year as the model homes‚Äô opening, the Arizona State Legislature set aside $5 million to build a prison near the proving grounds. Plans for the prison, however, were later scrapped. The area's first elementary school, Kyrene de los Lomas, opened in 1976, while Mountain Pointe High School opened as the area's first high school in 1991.  Etymology  There exist three theories surrounding the name \\"Ahwatukee\\", with all three claiming the name has roots in the Crow language. Some stories of the name's origin trace back to Brinton, who chose a Crow-rooted name for her new property due to her time among the Crow Nation tribal members in Wyoming, and the influence it subsequently had on her. =House of dreams= Some sources claim the name is a Crow term for house of your dreams, house of my dreams, or house of dreams Until at least 2006, the Ahwatukee Foothills Chamber of Commerce acknowledged house of dreams as the meaning of the area's name. However, according to the Crow language dictionary maintained by the Crow Language Consortium, the Crow word for \\"house\\" is ash√©, and the Crow word for \\"dream\\" is baash√≠ale or balewaash√≠ale. =Land on the other side of the hill= Some sources claim the name is a Crow term for land on the other side of the hill, based on the Crow word awe chuuke. According to the same Crow dictionary, the word aw√© means \\"ground\\", \\"land\\", or \\"earth\\", and the word ch√∫uke means \\"over the ridge\\", \\"over the hill\\", or \\"the next valley over\\". =Flat land= According to The Everyday Language of White Racism by Jane Hill, the name closely resembles a Crow term for \\"flat land\\" or \\"prairie\\". According to the Crow language dictionary maintained by the Crow Language Consortium, the Crow word for \\"flat land\\" is \\"alawach√∫hke\\".  Geography  Ahwatukee Mercado, a strip mall on Elliot Road in Ahwatukee The Ahwatukee Foothills Village is bordered by Interstate 10 to the east, South Mountain to the north, and the Gila River Indian Community to the west and south. Ahwatukee is geographically isolated from the city of Phoenix, and was once seen as appropriate for semi-rural development.  Demographics  Based on 2016 estimates, the Ahwatukee Foothills Village has 83,464 residents. 83% of the population are White, 6.5% are Asian, 5.6% are Black or African American, 1.6% are Native American and 3.3% identify as some other race. 12.3% of the population is Hispanic. Due to the community's predominantly Caucasian racial makeup, the area has been called \\"All-White-tukee\\".  Education = Public  K-8 public school students in the area attend schools operated by the Kyrene School District. In fact, Ahwatukee-based schools constitute 12 out of 25 (48%) of Kyrene's schools. High school students go to one of two in the area: Desert Vista and Mountain Pointe. Both schools are operated by the Tempe Union High School District  Private  There are a number of private schools in Ahwatukee. One of the schools, Summit School of Ahwatukee, is ranked as one of the most expensive private schools in the Phoenix area by The Arizona Republic in 2014. Infrastructure= Transportation  The community is served by the ALEX neighborhood circulator, which is operated by Valley Metro Bus. Riders, however, have complained of poor service after a new contractor took over the route in 2016. Portions of Ahwatukee are also served by Valley Metro Routes 56-Priest Drive, 108-Elliot Road, 140-Ray Road, 156-Chandler Boulevard/Williams Field Road, and the I-10 East RAPID route. As a result of having access points only via 48th Street in the northeastern part of the area, and a number of east‚Äìwest crossings over I-10, Ahwatukee has been called the world's largest cul-de-sac. The building of Loop 202's South Mountain Freeway segment, however, has given the area a western gateway, via a series of exits along the southern border of the community.

Four flushing refers to empty boasting or unsuccessful bluffing, and a four flusher is a person who makes empty boasts or bluffs when holding a four flush. Four flusher can also refer to a welcher, piker, or braggart. This pejorative term originated in the 19th century when bluffing poker players misrepresented that they had a flush‚Äîa poker hand with five cards all of one suit‚Äîwhen they only had four cards of one suit. Optimal strategies for bluffing or folding when holding a four flush have been explored extensively in poker strategy books. In media 1919 film The Four Flusher The first Governor of Oklahoma, Charles N. Haskell, denounced President and political opponent Theodore Roosevelt, calling him a \\"four flusher\\". Metro Pictures released a comedy titled The Four-Flusher in 1919. Several other films have used the term in their titles. In the 1922 Harold Lloyd silent film Dr. Jack the phrase \\"a four-flusher\\" is used to describe the doctor in charge of \\"The Sick-Little-Well-Girl\\" in the city. In the 1926 silent film The Show-Off, the character Clara (played by Louise Brooks) refers to the character Aubrey Piper (played by Ford Sterling) as a four-flusher meaning he is a braggart or a person who makes false or pretentious claims. In the film, his \\"four-flushing\\" has resulted in the loss of money needed to pay for the mortgage on the Fisher family home. In the 1941 movie, Hellzapoppin' the character Pepi (played by Mischa Auer) is called a four flusher.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcB3_jCXBKg In the 1945 film Detour Tom Neal's character calls another character a four-flusher.

Construction started on May 1, 1906, on of land between Aubrey and Dominion streets. Portage Avenue bounded it to the north and the Assiniboine River was to the south. Today this area is part of the Wolseley neighbourhood of Winnipeg. The total cost to construct the park was about $150,000 and were illuminated by 12,000 lights. The main side of the park fronted of the south side of Portage Avenue with a high wooden fence sporting the word \\"Happyland\\" and advertisements detailing the amusements to be found inside. The park opened to the public on May 23 1906. The main attraction at Happyland Park was the baseball games. The Winnipeg Maroons would play American teams of the Northern League from Duluth, Grand Forks, Fargo, etc. The first game, attended by 4,000 fans, was held on May 24, 1906. It saw the home team lose 7 to 5 to the visiting Duluth team. By 1914 the owners of the Park had sold off a portion of the land for private residential development. The park closed in 1922. Another park of the same name exists today in St. Boniface. In Guy Maddin's My Winnipeg, the signage and other materials are used in a rooftop homeless encampment.

The park is in the southeast part of the Town of Cornwall, next to the Hudson River. A central feature of the park is Storm King Mountain. History New York physician Ernest Stillman donated the park's initial to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in 1922, hoping to protect land surrounding the Storm King Highway. The park has since grown to its current size through additional donations and purchases of land. The park was the focus of preservation efforts in the early 1960s after a proposal by Consolidated Edison to build a hydro-electric power plant on the property. The Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference was formed by citizens opposed to the project, and the proposal was eventually dropped following a 17-year battle to preserve the park's natural state. A 1999 forest fire at the park caused the detonation of unexploded ordnance that had been fired over 100 years prior by a cannon manufacturer across the river. Additional unexploded shells were also discovered that likely originated from a nearby West Point artillery range. After the fire was put out, the park remained closed to hikers for three years as remaining explosives were located and removed. Description Storm King State Park is undeveloped except for limited parking and trails. The park offers hiking and seasonal deer hunting. Several named trails are included within the park, which features Storm King Mountain as a central feature. The park's forests are part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.

Early years Soto Toro was raised in a poor section of the City of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico known as El Barrio Amelia. As a child, he was interested in everything that had to do with light bulbs and electricity. He obtained his primary and secondary education in his hometown and went to high school at the Colegio Madre Cabrini in San Juan. In 1984, after graduating from high school, Soto Toro enrolled at the Florida Institute of Technology, located in Melbourne, Florida. In 1986, while in college, he decided that he would like to become an engineer for NASA. Soto Toro participated in the Cooperative Education Program. Career at NASA In 1990, Soto Toro earned his bachelor's degree in science in electrical engineering. He was hired by NASA, a month after graduating and assigned to the Design Engineering Networks Communications section at Kennedy Space Center. In 1992, he completed his master's degree in science in electrical engineering, and by 1997, he completed another Masters in Science Degree. By specializing in the communications field of electrical engineering, he improved his credentials towards his goal of becoming an astronaut. At the Kennedy Space Center, Soto Toro reviews, designs, builds, tests and implements engineering designs used in the Space Shuttle and Payload Operations Development Laboratories. The main project he developed was the Advanced Payload Transfer Measurement System, which consists of a simplified, robust, centrally operated and portable system that automatically measures the spherical coordinates offset between the trunnion and their supports during transfer operations. Soto Toro earned his Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Electrical Engineering and applied to become an astronaut candidate. In NASA, Soto Toro works with testing ground support equipment used in pre-launch, launch and post-launch activities. Honors Soto Toro was presented with the 2003 \\"El Premio Coqui\\" by La Casa de Puerto Rico in Florida for his contributions in the field of science. On November 9, 2003, Soto Toro, along with another Puerto Rican astronaut applicant, Henry Bursian Berr√≠os, and Ninfa Segarra, who was the first Hispanic Deputy Mayor of New York City, were named the Grand Marshals of the Puerto Rican Day Parade held in Palm Bay, Florida.

They rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most important families in the kingdom, holding various high offices and with extensive holdings in the Holy Land and Cyprus. The family disappeared after the fall of the Kingdom of Cyprus in the 15th century. Name The family took their name from the castle of Ibelin, which was built in 1141 by King Fulk I and entrusted to Barisan, the founder of the family. Ibelin was the crusader's name for the Arab city of Yibna, where the castle was situated. The castle fell to the Saracens at the end of the 12th century, but by then the family had holdings at Beirut and in Cyprus. First and second family generations Balian of Ibelin, carrying King Baldwin V The Ibelin family rose from relatively humble origins to become one of the most important noble families in the Crusader states of Jerusalem and Cyprus. The family claimed to be descended from the Le Puiset viscounts of Chartres in France,Riley-Smith p. 172-3 though this may be a later fabrication. Other sources suggest they were from Pisa, Italy,Edbury, p. 4-5 the name 'Barisan' being found in Tuscany and Liguria related to the Azzopardi family. Its first known member, Barisan of Ibelin, was apparently a knight in service of the Count of Jaffa and in the 1110s became constable of Jaffa. As reward for his capable and loyal service, around 1122 he married Helvis, heiress of the nearby lordship of Ramla. Barisan was given the castle of Ibelin in 1141 by King Fulk as a reward for his loyalty during the revolt of his then master Hugh II of Le Puiset, Count of Jaffa, in 1134. Ibelin was part of the County of Jaffa, which was annexed to the royal domain after Hugh's unsuccessful revolt. Barisan's marriage with Helvis produced Hugh, Baldwin, Barisan, Ermengarde, and Stephanie. The younger Barisan came to be known as Balian. Along with Ibelin, the family then held Ramla (inherited from Helvis), and the youngest son Balian received the lordship of Nablus when he married Maria Comnena, the Dowager Queen. Balian was the last to hold these territories as they all fell to Saladin in 1187. The family underwent a remarkable rise in status in only two generations. In the circumstances of the crusader kingdom, this rapid rise, noblesse nouvelle, was not as difficult as it would have been in Europe. In crusader Palestine, individuals and whole families tended to die much sooner and replacements, sang nouveau, were needed. 13th century Balian's descendants were among the most powerful nobles in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Kingdom of Cyprus. Balian's first son John of Ibelin, the \\"Old Lord of Beirut\\", was the leader of the opposition to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, when the emperor tried to impose imperial authority over the crusader states. The family briefly regained control of the castle of Ibelin in 1241 in the aftermath of Frederick's Sixth Crusade, when certain territories were returned to the Christians by treaty. John had numerous children with Melisende of Arsuf, including Balian, lord of Beirut; Baldwin, seneschal of Cyprus; another John, lord of Arsuf and constable of Jerusalem; and Guy, constable of Cyprus. This Balian was married to Eschiva of Montb√©liard and was the father of John II of Beirut, who married the daughter of Guy I of la Roche, duke of Athens. John of Arsuf was the father of Balian of Arsuf, who married Plaisance of Antioch. Guy the constable was the father of Isabella, who married Hugh III de Lusignan. Balian of Ibelin's second son Philip was regent of Cyprus while his niece, the widowed Queen Alice, needed help to govern. With Alice of Montb√©liard, Philip was the father of John of Ibelin, count of Jaffa and Ascalon, regent of Jerusalem, and author of the Assizes of the Haute Cour of Jerusalem, the most important legal document from the crusader kingdom. John married Maria, sister of Hethum I of Armenia, and was the father of James, count of Jaffa and Ascalon and also a noted jurist; and of Guy, count of Jaffa and Ascalon and husband of his cousin Maria, Hethum's daughter. Several members of the family went to the new kingdom of Cyprus at the beginning of the 13th century. Most of the rest moved there as the mainland kingdom was lost piece by piece. No members of the Ibelin family seem to have gone to any other country during this period. At this time, some of the Embriaco lords of Gibelet, relatives of the Ibelins, also took the name of \\"Ibelin\\" because of their common maternal descent. Despite the family's modest origins on the paternal side, the Ibelins during the 13th‚Äì15th centuries were among the highest nobility in the Kingdom of Cyprus, producing brides for younger sons, grandsons and brothers of kings (though the kings and eldest sons tended to find more royal wives). Ibelins lived among the highest circles of Cyprus, and married into the royal family, the Lusignans, and among such families as Montfort, Dampierre, ducal Brunswick, Montbeliard, and Gibelet(-Ibelins). They married also into other branches of Ibelins. They also had loftier ancestors: Maria Comnena was from the Byzantine imperial Comnenus dynasty, and was descended from the kings of Georgia, Bulgaria, ancient Armenia, Parthia, Persia and Syria. When the Kingdom of Cyprus was destroyed in the 15th century, the Ibelins apparently also lost their lands and positions, and the family possibly became extinct ‚Äî the sources, at least, no longer mention them. Descendants of the Ibelins, through the royal Lusignans, include several royal families of modern Europe, since their descendant Anne, Duchess of Savoy, daughter of Janus of Cyprus, was, for example, the ancestor of the Dukes of Savoy, the La Tremoille princes of Talmond and Taranto, the Longueville family, the princes of Monaco, the electors of Bavaria, the Farnese of Parma, the last Valois kings of France, the Dukes of Lorraine, the Habsburg-Lorraines, the Bourbons of Navarre and France, and, as their progeny, practically all Catholic royalty in recent centuries.

While researching crests and coats of arms for the film (which used real and fabricated crests), members of the production team discovered this crest - a red cross on a gold field - in a museum in Paris, with \\"Balian 1380\\" written under it. They were delighted, even though it wasn't \\"their\\" Balian, and used it as the Ibelin crest, despite it having no historic connection to that family. This information can be found in the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" companion book. Jean de Joinville in his account of the Sixth Crusade mentions the coat of arms of the Count of Jaffa, who at this time was John of Ibelin. Jeanville describes the coat of arms as \\"or with a cross of gules pat√©e\\", which roughly translates to \\"red cross patty on golden ground\\".Chronicles of the Crusades by Jean de Joinville and Geoffrey de Villehardouin. Transl. by Sir Frank Marzials. p.134f. That would mean the crest shown here is not that far off from the description given by Jean de Joinville. Although it remains unclear within the source, if it was the coat of arms of the Count of Jaffa, regardless of who was holding that county, or the coat of arms of the house of Ibelin. For Jean de Joinville mentions other Ibelin in his account, but fails to connect them to said coat of arms.

He was frequently accused of treason and features prominently in Dante's Divine Comedy. Biography In the 13th century, Italy was beset by the strife of two parties, the Ghibellines and the Guelphs. While the conflict was local and personal in origin, the parties had come to be associated with the two universal powers: the Ghibellines sided with the Holy Roman Emperor and his rule of Italy, while the Guelphs sided with the Pope, who supported self-governing city-states. House of della Gherardesca Pisa was controlled by the Ghibellines, while most of the surrounding cities were controlled by the Guelphs, most notably Pisa's trading rivals Genoa and Florence. Under the circumstances, Pisa adopted the \\"strong and vigilant government\\" of a podest√† \\"armed with almost despotic power\\"\\"Count Ugolino of Pisa\\", Bentley‚Äôs Miscellany 55 (1864), p. 173‚Äì78. Ugolino was born in Pisa into the della Gherardesca family, a noble family of Germanic origins whose alliance with the Hohenstaufen Emperors had brought to prominence in Tuscany and made them the leaders of the Ghibellines in Pisa. Between 1256 and 1258 he participated in the war against the filo-genoese giudicato of Cagliari, in Sardinia. Ugolino then obtained the south-western portion of the former giudical territory, with its rich silver mines, where he founded the important city of Villa di Chiesa, today Iglesias. Ugolino and his sons by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, 1861, Petit Palais. As head of his family, the Ghibelline party and podest√† of Pisa, Ugolino took action to preserve his power in the face of the political hostility of Pisa's neighbours. In 1271, through a marriage of his sister with Giovanni Visconti, judge of Gallura, he allied himself with the Visconti, the leaders of the Guelphs in Pisa. In doing so, he aroused the suspicions of his fellow Ghibellines. The subsequent disorders in the city in 1274 led to the arrest of both Ugolino and Giovanni, who were accused of plotting to undermine Pisa's government and, with the support from Tuscany's Guelphs, share power among themselves. Ugolino was imprisoned and Giovanni banished from Pisa. Giovanni Visconti died soon afterwards, and Ugolino, no longer regarded as a threat, was set free and banished. In exile, Ugolino immediately began to intrigue with the Guelph cities of Florence and Lucca. With the help of Charles I of Anjou, he attacked his native city and forced it to make peace on humiliating terms, pardoning him and all the other Guelph exiles. After his return, Ugolino at first remained aloof from politics but quietly worked to reassert his influence. In 1284, war broke out between Pisa and Genoa and both Ugolino and Andreotto Saracini were appointed as captains of two divisions of fleets by Alberto Morosini, the Podest√† of Pisa. The two fleets met in August in the Battle of Meloria. The Genoese fought valiantly and destroyed seven Pisan galleys and captured twenty-eight. Among the eleven thousand captives was the Podest√†. Ugolino and his division set the sign of surrender and withdrew, deciding the battle in favour of Genoa. This flight was later interpreted as treachery but not by any writer earlier than the 16th century.G. del Noce, in Il Conte U. della Gherardesca (1894), takes treachery as the only motive behind the flight, while Daniella Bartoli, in the 6th volume of his Storia della letteratura italiana, suggests Ugolino's alliance with the Ghibellines as the motive. When Florence and Lucca took advantage of the naval defeat to attack Pisa, Ugolino was appointed podest√† for a year and succeeded in pacifying them by ceding certain castles. When Genoa suggested peace on similar terms, Ugolino was less eager to accept, for the return of the Pisan prisoners, including most of the leading Ghibellines, would have diminished his power. Ugolino, now appointed capitano del popolo for ten years, was now the most influential man in Pisa but was forced to share his power with his nephew Nino Visconti, son of Giovanni. The duumvirate did not last, as Ugolino and Nino soon quarrelled. In 1287, Nino, striving to become Podest√†, entered into negotiations with Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, Archbishop of Pisa, and the Ghibellines. Ugolino reacted by driving Nino and several Ghibelline families out of the city, destroying their palaces and occupying the town hall, where he had himself proclaimed lord of the city. Torre della Muda, Giovanni Paolo Lasinio, engravings dated 1865. In April of that year, Ugolino again refused to make peace with Genoa, even though the enemy was willing to be content itself with financial reparations. Ugolino still feared the return of the captured Pisans, who saw Ugolino as the cause for their prolonged captivity and had sworn to get their revenge for this. In 1288, Pisa was hit by a dramatic increase in prices, resulting in food shortage and riots among the bitter populace. During one of these riots, Ugolino killed a nephew of the Archbishop, turning the latter against him. On 1 July 1288, after leaving a council-meeting discussing peace with Genoa, Ugolino and his followers were attacked by a band of armed Ghibellines. Ugolino withdrew into the town hall and repelled all attacks. The Archbishop, accusing Ugolino of treachery, aroused the citizens. When the town hall was set on fire, Ugolino surrendered. While his illegitimate son was killed, Ugolino himself ‚Äì together with his sons Gaddo and Uguccione and his grandsons Nino (surnamed \\"the Brigand\\") and Anselmuccio ‚Äì were detained in the Muda, a tower belonging to the Gualandi family. In March 1289, on orders of the Archbishop, who had proclaimed himself podest√†, the keys were thrown into the Arno river and the prisoners left to starve. Their corpses were buried in the cloister of Saint Francis Church and remained there until 1902, when they were exhumed and transferred to the Gherardesca family chapel. Literary afterlife The historical details of the episode are still involved in some obscurity, and although mentioned by Villani and other writers, it owes its fame entirely to Dante's Divine Comedy. Dante's account has been paraphrased by Chaucer in the Monk's Tale of the Canterbury Tales, as well as by Shelley. Irish poet Seamus Heaney also recounts the legend in his poem \\"Ugolino\\" found in his 1979 book Field Work. Giovanni Pascoli writes of Ugolino in 'Conte Ugolino', a poem from his Primi Poemetti. Ugolino in Dante's Inferno Dante and Virgil in the Inferno before Ugolino and His Sons by Priamo della Quercia (15th century) Dante placed Ugolino and Ruggieri in the ice of the second ring (Antenora) of the lowest circle of the Inferno, which is reserved for betrayers of kin, country, guests, and benefactors. Ugolino's punishment involves his being entrapped in ice up to his neck in the same hole with his betrayer, Archbishop Ruggieri, who left him to starve to death. Ugolino is constantly gnawing at Ruggieri's skull. As Dante describes it, Ugolino's gnawing of Ruggieri's head has been interpreted as meaning that Ugolino's hatred for his enemy is so strong that he is compelled to \\"devour even what has no substance.\\"Joan M. Ferrante. The Political Vision of the Divine Comedy. Princeton University Press (1984). Ugolino, though punished for his betrayal of his people, is allowed some closure for the betrayal that he himself was forced to suffer under Ruggieri, when he is allowed to act as Ruggieri's torturer for eternity. According to Frances Yates, both are \\"suffering the torments of the damned in the traitors' hell; but Ugolino is given the right to oppress ... Archbishop Ruggieri with a ghastly eternal punishment which fits his crime.\\"Frances A. Yates. \\"Transformations of Dante's Ugolino\\". Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 14(1/2) (1951), p. 92‚Äì117. doi:10.2307/750354. JSTOR 750354. Ugolino and his children Ugolino and his sons in their cell, as painted by William Blake circa 1826. Henry Fuseli ‚Äì Ugolino and his Sons Starving to Death in the Tower (1806) According to Dante, the prisoners were slowly starved to death and before dying Ugolino's children begged him to eat their bodies. Ugolino's statement that hunger proved stronger than grief has been interpreted in two ways, either that Ugolino devoured his offspring's corpses after being driven mad with hunger, or that starvation killed him after he had failed to die of grief. The first and more ghastly of these interpretations has proved the more popular and resonant. For this reason Ugolino is known as the \\"Cannibal Count\\" and is often depicted gnawing at his own fingers (\\"eating of his own flesh\\") in consternation, as in the sculpture The Gates of Hell by Auguste Rodin, in Ugolino and his Sons by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and in other artwork, though this may also simply refer to Ugolino's own statement in the poem that he gnawed his fingers in grief. Ugolino in Borges The case of Ugolino and Ruggiero is behind the story of the short story \\"The Wait\\" (La espera) of Jorge Luis Borges in the collection named The Aleph (El Aleph) (1949). Scientific analysis of the remains In 2002, paleoanthropologist Francesco Mallegni conducted DNA testing on the recently excavated bodies of Ugolino and his children. His analysis agrees with the remains being a father, his sons and his grandsons. Additional comparison to DNA from modern day members of the Gherardesca family leave Mallegni about 98 percent sure that he has identified the remains correctly. However, the forensic analysis discredits the allegation of cannibalism. Analysis of the rib bones of the Ugolino skeleton reveals traces of magnesium, but no zinc, implying he had consumed no meat in the months before his death. Ugolino also had few remaining teeth and is believed to have been in his 70s when he was imprisoned, making it further unlikely that he could have outlived and eaten his descendants in captivity. Additionally, Mallegni notes that the putative Ugolino skull was damaged; perhaps he did not ultimately die of starvation, although malnourishment is evident.Nicole Martinelli, \\"Dante and the Cannibal Count\\" , Newsweek (1 February 2007).Francesco Mallegni, M. Luisa Ceccarelli Lemut. Il conte Ugolino di Donoratico tra antropologia e storia (2003). In 2008, Paola Benigni, superintendent to the Archival Heritage of Tuscany, disputed Mallegni's findings in an article, claiming that the documents assigning the burial to Ugolino and his descendants were Fascist-era forgeries.Paola Benigni, Massimo Becattini. \\"Ugolino della Gherardesca: cronaca di una scoperta annunciata\\".

His name was later written as \\"Balian\\" and he is sometimes known as Balian the Elder, Barisan the Old or Balian I. Barisan was lord of Ramla from 1138-1150. Barisan's origins are obscure. The Ibelins later claimed to be descended from the viscounts of Chartres, but according to Peter W. Edbury, Barisan was probably from northern Italy.Peter W. Edbury, John of Ibelin and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (Boydell Press, 1997), pg. 4. According to Jonathan Riley-Smith, however, he may have indeed been connected to Chartres, as the brother of Hugh of Le Puiset, Count of Jaffa; he would then have also been a cousin to the Montlh√©ry family of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem.Jonathan Riley-Smith, The First Crusaders, 1095-1131 (Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. 172-173. However, nothing certain is known of his life before 1115, when he appears as constable of Jaffa under Hugh. In 1120 he was present at the Council of Nablus, where the first laws of the kingdom were promulgated, perhaps representing the new, underaged Count of Jaffa, Hugh II.Riley-Smith, pg. 173. Around the same year, his services were rewarded with a marriage to Helvis of Ramla, daughter of Baldwin I of Ramla. In 1134, when Hugh II rebelled against King Fulk, Barisan supported the king, and soon became prominent at Fulk's court. In 1141, perhaps as a reward for his loyalty in 1134, he was granted the newly constructed castle of Ibelin, located in the County of Jaffa between Jaffa itself and the Fatimid Egyptian fortress of Ascalon. It was from this castle that the family took their name.Edbury, pg. 4. In 1148 Barisan inherited the nearby lordship of Ramla, through his wife Helvis.Edbury, pg. 5 That year, Barisan was also present at the council convened at Acre after the arrival of the Second Crusade, at which it was decided to attack Damascus. Barisan died in 1150 and Ibelin was inherited by Hugh. Helvis then married Manasses of Hierges, Constable of Jerusalem.Edbury, pg. 5.

Biography Wang was born in Jiashan County (present day Mingguang City) in China's Anhui province in 1915 and joined the Communist Party of China in 1938. During his early career within the government of the People's Republic of China, he focused on trade and investment issues. In 1965 he was the deputy minister of the State Commission for Foreign Economic Relations with Foreign Countries and in 1979 he was appointed vice-chair of the State Foreign Investment Commission and vice-chair of the State Import-Export Commission. Later Wang came to greater prominence when, after a year as vice-mayor, he was appointed mayor of Shanghai in 1981. As mayor, Wang contributed to the success of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms by actively encouraging foreign investment and joint ventures. When he retired in 1985, Wang convinced the party authorities to name his prot√©g√© Jiang Zemin as his successor. On 16 December 1991 Wang was named the president of Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), a semi-official organization created to correspond with the Taiwan- based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). The following year Wang and SEF chairman Koo Chen-fu held preliminary talks in Hong Kong which resulted in the so-called \\"1992 Consensus\\" and facilitated negotiations of practical matters. However, the content and the very existence of this \\"1992 Consensus\\" is still widely disputed. In April 1993, Koo and Wang met in Singapore to hold the Wang-Koo summit. A second round of talks followed in 1998, in Shanghai, but no further talks have taken place since. Beijing called off talks in 1999, after Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui proposed his two-states theory. Wang died in Shanghai on the morning of 24 December 2005.

The belligerents were Spanish forces led by Governor-General of the Philippines Ferm√≠n J√°udenes, and American forces led by United States Army Major General Wesley Merritt and United States Navy Commodore George Dewey. American forces were supported by units of the Philippine Revolutionary Army, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The battle is sometimes referred to as the \\"Mock Battle of Manila\\" because the local Spanish and American generals, who were legally still at war, secretly and jointly planned the battle to transfer control of the city center from the Spanish to the Americans while keeping the Philippine Revolutionary Army out of the city center.. The battle left American forces in control of Intramuros, the center of Manila, surrounded by Philippine revolutionary forces, creating the conditions for the Battle of Manila of 1899 and the start of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Background After the American victory in Manila Bay on May 1, the United States Navy, under Admiral George Dewey, blockaded the city of Manila and waited for land forces to arrive. The United States organized the Eighth Army Corps, dubbed the Philippine Expeditionary Force, under the command of Major General Wesley Merritt.. On May 16, the vanguard of the force left San Francisco under the command of Brigadier General Thomas M. Anderson.. Merritt, on the same day, asked for information concerning the strength of the Spanish in the Philippines. The American consul in Hong Kong gave the information needed: 21,000 men including 4,000 Filipinos, all but 1,000 of them in Manila.. Dewey, however, sent more accurate information: around 40,000 troops including around 16,000 Filipinos, about 15,000 were situated in Manila, and nine artillery guns in Manila. By mid-June, some 40,000 Filipino revolutionaries under General Antonio Luna had dug fourteen miles of trenches around Manila. Filipino revolutionaries, seizing control of Manila's only pumping station, cut off the water supply to the city.. The first contingent of American troops arrived in Cavite on June 30, the second under General Francis V. Greene on July 17, and the third under General Arthur MacArthur on July 30. By this time, some 12,000 U.S. troops had landed in the Philippines.. Emilio Aguinaldo had presented surrender terms to Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Basilio August√≠n, who refused them initially, believing more Spanish troops would be sent to lift the siege., . As the combined forces of Filipinos and Americans closed in, August√≠n, realizing that his position was hopeless, secretly continued to negotiate with Aguinaldo, even offering ‚Ç±1 million, but the latter refused. When the Spanish parliament, the Cortes, learned of Governor-General August√≠n's attempt to negotiate the surrender of the army to Filipinos under Aguinaldo, it was furious, and relieved August√≠n of his duties as Governor-General, effective July 24, to be replaced by Fermin J√°udenes. On June 16, warships departed Spain to lift the siege, but they altered course for Cuba where a Spanish fleet was imperiled by the U.S. Navy.. In August, life in Intramuros (the walled center of Manila), where the normal population of about ten thousand had swelled to about seventy thousand, had become unbearable. Realizing that it was only a matter of time before the city fell, and fearing vengeance and looting if the city fell to Filipino revolutionaries, Governor J√°udenes suggested to Dewey, through the Belgian consul, √âdouard Andr√©, that the city be surrendered to the Americans after a short, \\"mock\\" battle. Dewey had initially rejected the suggestion because he lacked the troops to block the Filipino revolutionary forces, but when Merritt's troops became available he sent a message to J√°udenes, agreeing to the mock battle. Merritt was eager to seize the city, but Dewey stalled while trying to work out a bloodless solution with J√°udenes.. On August 4, Dewey and Merritt gave J√°udenes 48 hours to surrender, later extending the deadline by five days when it expired. Covert negotiations continued, with the details of the mock battle being arranged on August 10. The plan agreed to was that Dewey would begin a bombardment at 09:00 on August 13, shelling only Fort San Antonio Abad, a decrepit structure on the southern outskirts of Manila, and the impregnable walls of Intramuros. Simultaneously, Spanish forces would withdraw, Filipino revolutionaries would be checked, and U.S. forces would advance. Once a sufficient show of battle had been made, Dewey would hoist the signal \\"D.W.H.B.\\" (meaning \\"Do you surrender?.), whereupon the Spanish would hoist a white flag and Manila would formally surrender to U.S. forces., . Battle On August 13, with American commanders unaware that a peace protocol had been signed between Spain and the U.S. the previous day, Dewey began his bombardment as scheduled. Dewey directed his ship captains to spare Manila any serious damage, but gunners on one ship, unaware of the negotiated arrangements, scored several direct hits before its captain was able to cease firing and withdraw from the line.. General Greene's brigade pushed rapidly through Malate, Manila and over the bridges to occupy Binondo and San Miguel, Manila The advancing Americans made good use of new weapons, such as the M1897 Trench Gun which was ideal for close combat. General Arthur MacArthur Jr., advancing simultaneously on the Pasay road, encountered and overcame resistance at the blockhouses, trenches, and woods to his front, advanced and held the bridges and the town of Malate. This placed Manila in American possession, except for Intramuros. Shortly after entering Malate, U.S. troops observed a white flag displayed on the walls of Intramuros. Lieutenant Colonel C. A. Whittier, United States Volunteers, representing General Merritt, and Lieutenant Brumby, U.S. Navy, representing Admiral Dewey, were sent ashore to communicate with the Captain-General. General Merritt soon personally followed, met with Governor General J√°udenes, and concluded a preliminary agreement of the terms of capitulation.. Though a bloodless mock battle had been planned, Spanish troops had opened fire in a skirmish which left six Americans and forty-nine Spaniards dead when Filipino revolutionaries, thinking that the attack was genuine, joined advancing U.S. troops.. Except for the unplanned casualties, the battle had gone according to plan; the Spanish had surrendered the city to the Americans, and it had not fallen to the Filipino revolutionaries.. Aftermath For all practical purposes, the fall of Manila brought about the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the Philippines. Merritt and Dewey finally received word of the peace protocol on August 16.. Captain Henry Glass of the protected cruiser had accepted the surrender of Guam on June 20, while en route to Manila,. and Captain E.D. Taussig of the gunboat claimed Wake Island for the U.S. on January 17, 1899.. The war with Spain came to an end, but in February 1899, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War broke out. Tensions between the Filipino forces under Aguinaldo and the American Expeditionary forces were high. The Filipinos felt betrayed by the Americans. They had looked on the Americans as liberators aiding against Spanish occupation. On February 4, a U.S. Army private fired the first shot at a Filipino revolutionary soldier and Filipino revolutionary forces returned fire. This began the Battle of Manila of 1899. Aguinaldo sent a ranking member of his staff to Elwell Stephen Otis, the U.S. military commander, with the message that the firing had been against his orders. Otis replied, \\"The fighting, having begun, must go on to the grim end.\\" See also * Battles of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War References=Bibliography   * * Further reading * External links * Home of heroes * Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Manila 1898 Category:1898 in the Philippines Manila (1898), Battle of Manila (1898) Manila (1898), Battle of Manila Category:August 1898 events Category:Battles of the Philippine Revolution ","title":"Battle of Manila (1898)"},{"id":"1507825","text":"Hugh of Ibelin (c. 1132 - 1169/1171) was an important noble in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and was lord of Ramla from 1152-1169. Hugh was the eldest son of Barisan of Ibelin and Helvis of Ramla. He was old enough to witness charters in 1148, as was his younger brother Baldwin of Ibelin, which suggests he was born c. 1130-1133, as the male age of majority was fifteen. (H.E. Mayer has suggested a limited degree of competence may have been accepted from the age of eight, reducing his age, but the examples given of this are of males of the royal house, whose situation was somewhat different.) He was probably about ten years older than his youngest brother, Balian of Ibelin. After his father Barisan died in 1150, Helvis married the Constable of Jerusalem, Manasses of Hierges, who was one of the strongest supporters of Queen Melisende in the power struggle against her son King Baldwin III. Manasses was exiled in 1152 when Baldwin was victorious in this struggle, allowing Hugh to inherit Ramla from his mother. Hugh took part in the Siege of Ascalon in 1153, and in 1157 was captured in battle at Banias, being released probably the next year. In 1159 he visited the Principality of Antioch and met with Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, who had arrived to assert his suzerainty over the principality. In 1163 Hugh married Agnes of Courtenay (1133 - 1184/1185), Lady of Toron, the former wife of King Amalric I and mother of Baldwin IV, daughter of Joscelin II de Courtenay, Count of Edessa, by whom he had no issue. It is possible that Agnes had already been betrothed or married to him before 1157, date some say it was the one of the actual marriage but she married Amalric after Hugh was taken prisoner; Amalric was forced to divorce her before becoming King in 1163. Hugh participated Amalric's expedition to Egypt in 1167, and was responsible for building a bridge over the Nile. The crusaders allied with the sultan against Shirkuh, the general of Nur ad-Din Zangi who was also fighting for control of Egypt, and Hugh was sent to protect Cairo along with the sultan's son Kamil. Hugh was the first crusader ever to see the sultan's palace. At the siege of Bilbeis during the same Egyptian campaign, according to Ibelin family tradition, Hugh's life was saved by Philip of Milly after breaking his leg and falling under his horse.Malcolm Barber, \\"The career of Philip of Nablus in the kingdom of Jerusalem,\\" in The Experience of Crusading, vol. 2: Defining the Crusader Kingdom, Peter Edbury and Jonathan Phillips, eds. (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pg. 61. Hugh died around 1169 during a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. His territories of Ibelin and Ramla passed to his brother Baldwin. Another Hugh of Ibelin was the son of John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, and the grand-nephew of this Hugh. ReferencesSources *William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea. E. A.

The pilot film was produced in 1961 (hence the 1961 copyright notice on the animated main title), but the series was not completed until 1963. Twenty-six episodes were produced; they were syndicated by Desilu Productions and played for several years on local stations. Content Host Hans Conried introduced short \\"flickers\\" pieced together from silent film footage and from other older movies, overdubbed with newly written comic dialogue, music, and sound effects. The voices for these were provided by fellow Ward mainstays Paul Frees, June Foray, and Bill Scott. The earliest episodes have careful dubbing, with the actors and writers taking pains to synchronize the new dialogue with the actors' lip movements. Once the series had deadlines to face, however, the time-consuming dubbing was abandoned, and the later episodes do not bother with exact synchronization. True to the Jay Ward brand of humor, the dialogue was loaded with puns and one-line jokes. (One silent vignette was retitled \\"The Barber of Stanwyck\\", utilizing scenes from Douglas Fairbanks' 1920 silent classic, The Mark of Zorro.) Movies, television, advertising, and even the Fractured Flickers series itself were fair game for merciless kidding. (Conried quipped, \\"This is what we'll be doing for the next several weeks--or until someone finds out!\\") The show was at its funniest when desecrating early melodramas with \\"hip\\" reinterpretations, such as presenting Rudolph Valentino as an insurance salesman or Lon Chaney, Sr.'s The Hunchback of Notre Dame as \\"Dinky Dunstan, Boy Cheerleader.\\" (Lon Chaney, Jr. was not amused by the latter and attempted unsuccessfully to sue Jay Ward over it.) Many segments were vicious satires of television commercials; a typical \\"word from our sponsor\\" would have the announcer extolling the virtues of the item being advertised, accompanied by darkly humorous clips. A fly-by-night real estate development, for example, was illustrated with clips of buildings being destroyed by a cyclone (from Steamboat Bill, Jr. with Buster Keaton). And \\"This moment of softness (explosions, wild parties, etc.) has been brought to you by Bee. Bee, the only tissue woven in mid-air by bees!\\" Regular features were the \\"Minute Mysteries\\", featuring Stan Laurel as master detective Sherman Oaks (his scenes \\"fractured\\" from his 1925 short comedy, Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde), and the weekly \\"tributes\\" to some American city. Each episode also featured a celebrity guest whom Conried would interview. Most were popular personalities of the 1960s such as Fabian, Bob Denver, Deborah Walley, Rod Serling, and Rose Marie. Many of them caught the spirit of the show, and answered Conried's questions with tongue in cheek. Many prominent figures of the 1960s were lampooned. A segment based on the Kennedy family (and produced long before air time) was excised from all copies of the series when John F. Kennedy was assassinated so that it was never shown. This segment remains lost to this day. The entire series is available on a DVD set from VCI Entertainment.  Guest stars  The following stars, listed in order of appearance by episode number, conversed with Conried during the guest segments. # Rose Marie # Fabian # Gypsy Rose Lee # Allan Sherman # Annette Funicello # Edward Everett Horton # Paula Prentiss # Sebastian Cabot # Roddy McDowall: reappears briefly after the following flicker, the only guest to reappear. # Vivienne Della Chiesa, opera singer # Connie Stevens # Rod Serling # Connie Hines # Cesar Romero # Diana Dors # Bullwinkle J.

By extension, demurrage refers to the charges that the charterer pays to the ship owner for its delayed operations of loading/unloading.Maritime Knowhow website: GENCON Clause 7 Officially, demurrage is a form of liquidated damages for breaching the laytime as it is stated in the governing contract (the charter party). The demurrage sometimes causes a loss to the seller as it increases cost of the total freight. The inverse of demurrage is despatch. If the charterer requires the use of the vessel for less time than the laytime allowed, the charter party may require the shipowner to pay despatch for the time saved.  Shipping  In commercial ship chartering, demurrage is an ancillary cost that represents liquidated damages for delays. It occurs when the vessel is prevented from loading or discharging cargo within the stipulated laytime (see affreightment: under Charter-parties). In the oil industry, it refers to the excess time taken to discharge or load, as the case may be, in excess of the allowed laytime. Laytime is the term used to quantify the time allowed within which an operation is allowed to be made. Demurrage is laytime consumed less laytime allocated (if any). The master of the ship must give a Notice of Readiness (NOR) to the charterer when the ship has arrived at the port of loading or discharge. The NOR informs the charterer that the ship is ready to load or discharge. The date and time of the NOR determines when laytime is to commence.Maritime knowhow website: Notice of Readiness At the end of the stay in port, the port agent draws up a Statement of Facts, setting out a log of events during the ship's stay in port. The Statement of Facts enables a time sheet to be drawn up and signed by the master and the shipper or receiver of the cargo. The time sheet enables laytime and therefore demurrage or despatch to be calculated.Maritime knowhow website: Statement of facts, Time sheet  Container haulage  Because the supply of a shipping container to a merchant has a similar nature to the contract of a supply of a vessel to a voyage charter, the industry refers to this container usage beyond the time allowed as Container Demurrage. This extra usage usually entitles the container supplier (usually the shipping carrier) to require a payment from the merchant. In principle, it can be considered that the similarity between vessel demurrage and container demurrage is correct since both refer to the same concept, which is the late return of equipment supplied by one party to another for the purpose of carrying a cargo. However, the actual regime of container demurrage is still to be determined precisely. In container haulage, customers are given a set period in their contract to tip (unload) their container delivery. Acceptable times for tipping are usually between 3 and 4 hours; time spent on site after that is considered \\"demurrage\\". Haulers will usually charge an hourly rate for each hour after the allowed time. Demurrage can also refer to the cost levied by shipping lines to cover redecoration of the container after use by the merchant, but it could also be the charges by the shipping line to customers for not returning the container in a reasonable time.  Railway transport  In railway law, it is the charge on detention of trucks (or rolling stock), either to the shipper for holding the car (laden or not), or to the connecting railroad(s) while the car is empty and returning to the home road (in either case, as a way to encourage speedy unloading and return of empties to improve utilisation of rolling stock).  Business and banking  In business, demurrage is a delay in delivery of a product via delivery truck. When a delay occurs with product delivery, the delivery party can elect to claim a no fault delay by submitting a demurrage charge. Criteria for allowable demurrage, payment conditions, and payment terms for demurrage are typically prenegotiated and accepted by the vendor via contract prior to conduct of business. Some vendors allow free no-cost time for limited hour(s) when demurrage occurs, others do not allow free time for delays. The demurrage charge is normally an hourly rate. Unforeseeable until delivery, costs of delays are sometimes separately invoiced from the cost of deliverable. In banking, demurrage is the charge per ounce made by the Bank of England in exchanging coin or notes for bullion.

It is located in the Tuggeranong, Canberra, close to Tuggeranong Town Centre and on the shores of Lake Tuggeranong in Greenway. The principal is Julie Murkins. History The school was established in 1990 under the oversight of principal Robert (Bob) McConchie. The enrolment consisted of approximately 400 students. The second principal, John See, was appointed in 1997. On the retirement of John See at the end of 2006, William (Bill) Maiden was appointed as principal. As of 2014 the college has over 734 students enrolled. Campus The college is prominently positioned on the shores of Lake Tuggeranong, Greenway and is close to the Tuggeranong Town Centre and bus terminal. The college campus and the adjoining public library was designed by the firm Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Briggs, the same firm the designed the High Court of Australia building and National Gallery of Australia in Parkes. Campus facilities include general use science laboratories; metal, wood, and auto technology workshops; a kitchen class room; sporting facilities including a rowing shed; drama, dance, art and photography studios; and teaching spaces from 20 person class rooms to an eighty-seat lecture theatre. Tuggeranong Town Centre Library is adjacent to the college and is a joint-use facility catering for the educational needs of college students and for community use. The proximity of the library provides students with access to the ACT public library collection, free computing facilities and study space. Fully qualified Teacher Librarians, in addition to ACT Public Library staff, further the services provided to college students. Student admissions Lake Tuggeranong College admits around 450 year 11 students each year. Education programs are offered for students intending to apply for university admission as well as those seeking vocational training. The college also provides for students with special needs accepting children from special education schools. The college does not discriminate between students seeking higher tertiary education and vocational studies in its admissions process. The campus culture is structured on university lines, with large amounts of freedom of expression and emphasis on personal responsibility with regard to educational commitment than privately operated equivalent schools. The ACT government does not allow schools to set compulsory fees to its domestic students, however the college Board suggests a voluntary contribution which includes a base sum of $180 per year. Around 60% of students pay this contribution. Students enrol in 4 to 8 subjects, which are classified as to whether or not they constitute formal pre-tertiary training. If they have that T classification, students are ranked in the subject. Other vocational courses are designed to provide training for the work force or for personal educational enrichment. Students who are enrolled in ASBAs only have to enroll in 4 subjects as they spend a day a week engaged in on-the-job training.

The Dhauladhar range (lit. The White Range)Singh (2000), p. 2. is part of a lesser Himalayan chain of mountains. It rises from the Indian plains to the north of Kangra and Mandi. Dharamsala, the headquarters of Kangra district, lies on its southern spur in above the Kangra Valley, which divides it from Chamba.Dhaula Dhar The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 11, p. 287. Overview The highest peak in the range is the Hanuman Tibba, approached from Beas Kund/Manali, about 5982m high. There are several peaks which are close to 5,180 m (17,000 ft). Himachal Pradesh has all the major Himalayan ranges represented in it. The Greater Himalayas that begin from near Ladakh and run all the way to Mount Everest and Kangchenjunga in Sikkim, pass through Himachal Pradesh. The Pir Panjal Range starting from near Patni Top in Jammu and Kashmir all the way to Garhwal passes through Himachal Pradesh. Finally, there is the Dhauladhar range, also known as the Outer Himalayas or Lesser Himalayas. They begin from near Dalhousie at the northwest end of Himachal Pradesh and pass through the state to the vicinity of the bank of the Beas River in the Kulu district of Himachal Pradesh. While they end near Badrinath in Garhwal, they lie almost entirely in Himachal Pradesh. They are distinctive in their typical dark granite rocky formations with a remarkably steep rise culminating in sharp streaks of snow and ice at the top of their crested peaks. This distinctive profile is best seen from the Kangra Valley from where they seem to shoot up almost vertically. The elevation of the Dhauladhars ranges widely from 3,500 m to nearly 6,000 m. From the banks of the Beas river in Kulu, the range curves towards the town of Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India. Then, running north, it passes through Barabhangal, joins the Pir Panjal range and moves into Chamba, Himachal Pradesh.Dhauladhar peak from centerThe Dhauladhars have a peculiar topography. Although mostly composed of granite, the flanks of the range exhibit frequent formations of slate (often used for the roofs of houses in the region), limestone and sandstone. Ascending from any side is a difficult, given the near vertical incline. This calls for highly technical trekking and mountaineering. There is very little habitation on the range given the harsh conditions. But meadows abound near the crest providing rich pastures for grazing where large numbers of Gaddi shepherds take their flocks. The top of the crest is buried under vast expanses of thick snow. Triund - Ilaqua Ghot (‡§á‡§≤‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ò‡•ã‡§ü), approached from the hill station of McLeod Ganj, is the nearest and most accessible snow line in the Indian Himalayas. The range has rich flora and fauna. Peaks, virgin and scaled, have drawn mountaineers from all over the world. Some of the well-known ones are Mun (4610 m) near Dharamshala, Manimahesh Kailash (‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø‡§Æ‡§π‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•à‡§≤‡§æ‡§∂) (5653 m) in the sacred Manimahesh region, Gaurjunda (4946 m), near the Talang pass, which is commonly referred to as the 'Dhauladhar Matterhorn', Christmas (4581 m), Toral (4686 m), Dromedary (4553 m), Riflehorn (4400 m), Lantern (5100 m), Arthur's Seat (4525 m), Camel (4520 m), Slab (4570 m), and several other named and unnamed peaks. 453x453px Due to the position of the range it receives two monsoons a year with heavy rains; where the mountains have not been heavily logged, there are dense pine and Deodar forests. There are glacial lakes in the Dhauladhars. Prominent among them is the Lam Dal which is the biggest with a circumference of about 2.5 km. It is a very sacred lake and considered to be the abode of Lord Shiva. Each year pilgrims take a holy dip in August and September just when the Manimahesh yatra begins. There are other very sacred lakes like the Nag Dal/Nag Chattri Dal. This lake owes its history to the Bhagsunag Temple and is considered sacred. It is dedicated to the Nag Devta or the Lord King Cobra. The other beautiful lakes are the Chanderkup Dal above the Lam Dal, Kareri Dal below the Minkaini Pass, Dansar Lake across the Sari Pass and the very sacred Kali Kund just 150 m below the Lam Dal at an elevation of 3900 m and approachable from Minkiani Pass (4250 metres). One of the major passes across this range is the Indrahar Pass. At an altitude of 4,342 metres (14,245 ft) above mean sea level, near the tourist town of Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, Indrahar Pass forms the border between Kangra and Chamba districts. It is part of a popular trekking route from Dharamshala. It attracts substantial tourist traffic during the trekking season between April and October. The Dhauladhar mountain range became visible after 30 years in Jalandhar, Punjab, less than 200 kms away, after pollution levels came down amidst the Coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. The straight line distance to this mountain range from Jalandhar is only 120-140 kms. And if you use the distance to horizon formula from here Horizon then at 200 kms distance you can see a 3150 m peak. Here it says the range is 3500 m to 6000 m and so you can easily see it in clear days from Jalandhar (elevation: 228 m).

He obtained this title as a result of a revolution which led to the deposing of His Majesty Sir Jamshid bin Abdullah, the last reigning Sultan of Zanzibar, in . Three months later, the United Republic of Tanzania was founded, and Karume became the first Vice President of the United Republic with Julius Nyerere of Tanganyika as president of the new country. He was the father of Zanzibar's former president, Amani Abeid Karume. Early career Allegedly born at the village of Mwera, Zanzibar in 1905, Karume had little formal education and worked as a seaman before entering politics. He left Zanzibar in the early years of his life, traveling among other places to London, where he gained an understanding of geopolitics and international affairs through exposure to African thinkers such as Kamuzu Banda of Malawi. Karume developed an apparatus of control through the expansion of the Afro- Shirazi Party and its relations with the Tanganyika African National Union party. Revolution in Zanzibar On 10 December 1963, the United Kingdom granted full independence to Zanzibar after the Zanzibar National Party (ZNP) and Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party won the elections. The Sultan was a constitutional monarch. Initial elections gave government control to the ZNP. Karume was willing to work within the electoral framework of the new government, and actually informed a British police officer of the revolutionary plot set to take place in January. Karume was not in Zanzibar on 12 January 1964, the night of the revolution, and was instead on the African mainland. The instigator of the rebellion was a previously unknown Ugandan, John Okello. The revolution was violent, short, and the revolutionaries prevailed. Thousands of Zanzibaris, mostly Zanzibari Arabs & Indians, were murdered, with relatively few casualties on the revolutionary side. The Zanzibar Revolution brought an end to about 500 years of Arab domination on the island during which the Arab Slave Trade, most significantly, had resulted in a strong resentment among the majority African population. Power struggle Karume on Tanzania 200 shillings Having taken control of the island, John Okello invited Abeid Karume back to the island to assume the title of President of the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba. Other Zanzibaris in foreign territory were also invited back, most notably the Marxist politician Abdulrahman Mohammad Babu, who was appointed to the Revolutionary Council. John Okello reserved for himself the title of \\"Field Marshal\\", a position with undefined power. What followed was a three-month- long internal struggle for power. Karume used his political skills to align the leaders of neighboring African countries against Okello and invited Tanganyikan police officers into Zanzibar to maintain order. As soon as Okello took a trip out of the country, Karume declared him an \\"enemy of the state\\" and did not allow him to return. Given the presence of Tanganyikan police and the absence of their leader, Okello's gangs of followers did not offer any resistance. Karume's second important political move came when he agreed to form a union with the Tanganyikan president Julius Nyerere in . The union ensured that the new country, to be called Tanzania, would not align itself with the Soviet Union and communist bloc, as A.M. Babu had advocated. Given the new legitimacy of Karume's government (now solidly backed up by mainland Tanganyika), Karume marginalized Babu to the point of irrelevance. The Marxist leader was eventually forced to flee Tanzania after being charged with masterminding the assassination of Karume in 1972. As a result, Karume was rewarded the post of First Vice-President. Assassination and legacy Karume was assassinated in in Zanzibar Town. Four gunmen shot him dead as he played bao at the headquarters of the Afro-Shirazi Party. Reprisals followed against people suspected to have been opposed to Karume's regime. Amani Abeid Karume, Abeid's son, was elected two times as the president of Zanzibar, in 2000 and 2005 by a popular majority and handed over power in late 2010 to his successor Ali Mohamed Shein.

South of Ensenada, Highway 1 becomes a narrow (but relatively well-maintained) two-lane highway. Slow but steady progress is being made to support the tourism industry and Pemex gas stations are now located in every major town through which Highway 1 travels on the way to San Ignacio, both from the North and from the South. Driving only during daylight hours is recommended, due to livestock that frequently cross the road at night, and decreased visibility of the narrow and winding roads through the mountain sides. The nearest airports are located to the north at Guerrero Negro Airport in Guerrero Negro, or to the south at Loreto International Airport in Loreto. References=Bibliography * C. Michael Hogan. 2009.

It is located in the Chelsea district of central London, adjacent to the Royal Hospital Chelsea, the home of the \\"Chelsea Pensioners\\". The museum is a non- departmental public body. It is usually open to the public from 10:00am to 5:30pm, except on 25‚Äì26 December and 1 January. Admission is free. Having reopened in March 2017 following a major ¬£23.75 million re-development project including ¬£11.5m from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the museum houses five galleries that cover British military history from the English Civil War up to modern day. This remit for the overall history of British land forces contrasts with those of other military museums in the United Kingdom concentrating on the history of individual corps and regiments of the British Army. It also differs from the subject matter of the Imperial War Museum, another national museum in London, which has a wider remit of theme (war experiences of British civilians and military personnel from all three services) but a narrower remit of time (after 1914). History The National Army Museum was first conceived in the late 1950s, and owes its existence to the persistent hard work of Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, who did most of the fundraising for it. It was established by Royal Charter in 1960, with the intention of collecting, preserving, and exhibiting objects and records relating to the Regular and Auxiliary forces of the British Army and of the Commonwealth, and to encourage research into their history and traditions.Account, p. 3 It was initially established in 1960 in temporary accommodation at the former No.1 Riding School at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. A new purpose-built building, designed in brutalist style by William Holford & Partners, was started in 1961 on a site which had previously formed part of the old infirmary of the Royal Hospital Chelsea. The new building was completed ten years later and opened by the Queen on 11 November 1971. One director, Ian Robertson, initiated a programme to establish an outpost of the Museum in the garrison town of Catterick, North Yorkshire, to be known as National Army Museum North, on the model of Imperial War Museum's establishment of the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester. A large site was chosen near Marne Barracks, beside the A1, and in 2002 Simon Pierce of Austin- Smith:Lord was chosen as the new museum's architect. However, funding and planning issues later led to the cancellation of the plan in 2003. The National Army Museum instead underwent a major redevelopment of its gallery and corridor displays at Chelsea from 2006 onwards, establishing new displays in existing permanent display areas, converting the corridors from oil- painting displays to permanent-exhibition spaces, and producing new temporary and permanent display areas on the third floor. This redisplay concluded with the opening of the new permanent National Service gallery in October 2010, though a further phase of redevelopment followed from 2011 onwards.Account, p. 20 Refurbishment From 1 May 2014 until 30 March 2017 the museum was closed to the public for a major Heritage Lottery Fund-funded rebuilding programme.National Army Museum Secures ¬£11.5m Heritage Lottery Fund Grant , 30 April 2014 (NAM Press Archive)Helen Gilbert, New images of BDP's National Army Museum plans revealed, 30 April 2014 (Architects' Journal) The rebuilding was overseen by BDP architects, and specialist museum design company, Event Communications. Esther Dugdale from Event Communications noted that \\"The new museum aims to create a dialogue about the army ‚Äì not to promote it, but bring the discussion of it into the public domain\\", and \\"The displays express its multi-layered history and relationship with the public. It does not shy away from some of the more difficult issues, but also gives a voice to the many who have served and what they have experienced\\". Dugdale also stated that the new design would be an \\"immersive experience\\", allowing visitors to ride simulated tanks, load rifles and understand war tactics in a technology-driven 3D environment. In early March 2017, the Queen reopened the Museum, marking the completion of the three-year renovation. Galleries The museum has five new galleries ‚Äì Soldier, Army, Battle, Society and Insight. Governance The National Army Museum achieved devolved status as a non-departmental public body in 1983 under terms of the National Heritage Act. The annual Grant-in-Aid from the Ministry of Defence, is administered by the Director of the Museum on behalf of the governing body, the board of trustees of the National Army Museum.

Stanley took part in the Second Battle of Corinth and the Battle of Stones River as a division commander. He was later made a corps commander under William Tecumseh Sherman and sent to Tennessee to oppose John Bell Hood's Army of Tennessee. At a critical moment in the Battle of Franklin (November 1864), he saved part of George D. Wagner‚Äôs division from destruction, earning America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. Later he explored the Yellowstone River, and his favourable reports encouraged settlement of this region. Early life Stanley was born in Cedar Valley, Wayne County, Ohio. He graduated from West Point in 1852 and went to the Western frontier to survey railroad routes. He engaged in Indian fighting and was promoted to captain in March 1861, shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War. Stanley was on duty at Fort Washita in Indian Territory when war broke out. He led his men to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Civil War He fought at several battles in Missouri, including the Battle of Wilson's Creek, where he guarded the supply trains. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Stanley as brigadier general September 28, 1861, although the U.S. Senate did not confirm the appointment until March 7, 1862.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 728 Fighting in the Western Theater, he participated in the operations against New Madrid, Missouri and the Battle of Island Number Ten. He was involved in numerous major battles, including the Second Battle of Corinth, where he commanded a division of infantry of the Army of the Mississippi, and the Battle of Stones River, in which he led the cavalry of the Army of the Cumberland. On March 11, 1863, Stanley was appointed major general to rank from November 29, 1862.Eicher, 2001, p. 705 Stanley also led the Union cavalry in the Tullahoma Campaign. He fell ill late in 1863 and missed the Battle of Chickamauga. In 1864, he fought under William Tecumseh Sherman as a division commander in the IV Corps of the Army of the Cumberland during the Atlanta Campaign, and he was promoted to command of the corps when Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard was named commander of the Army of the Tennessee. After the capture of the city, instead of employing him marching to the sea, Sherman dispatched Stanley and his IV Corps to Tennessee to help protect the state from invasion by John Bell Hood's Army of Tennessee. For leading one of his brigades in a successful counterattack during a critical moment in the fighting at the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864, the President of the United States on behalf of the United States Congress presented him with the Medal of Honor on March 29, 1893. Two of his divisions having been reassigned to the defensive lines of the XXIII Corps before the battle, Stanley had no actual command. Two brigades of the remaining division, under Brig. Gen. George D. Wagner, were overwhelmed by the initial Confederate assault, having been left in an exposed position. It was for his role in the counterattack by the 3rd Brigade of Wagner's division that Stanley was awarded the medal. He was wounded in the neck at the same time and had his horse shot out from under him. Maj. Gen. Jacob Cox, commanding the defenses, provided Stanley a remount with which to seek medical attention, and Stanley did not participate further in the battle. He returned to corps command only after the Battle of Nashville. Postbellum career After the war, Stanley was appointed colonel of the 22nd U.S. Infantry, primarily serving in the Dakota Territory until 1874. He commanded the Yellowstone Expedition of 1873, successfully conducting his troops through several unmapped areas, and his favorable reports on the country led to subsequent settlement of the region. In 1879, Stanley and his regiment were reassigned to Texas to suppress Indian raids in the western portion of the state. He was ordered to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1882, and placed in command of the District of New Mexico. In March 1884, he was appointed a brigadier general in the regular army, and assigned command of the Department of Texas. He retired in 1892. Stanley was interred at the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery in Washington, D.C. - Plot: Section O-20. He was a First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and a Hereditary Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. In 1894 he became a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. His son-in-law, Willard Ames Holbrook (married to his daughter, Anna Huntington Stanley, American Impressionist artist), also served as a major general in the U.S. Army. His only son, David Sheridan Stanley, and five of his grandsons (including Willard Ames Holbrook, Jr.) would later graduate from West Point. Additionally, his son, David Sheridan Stanley was the principal founder of the Army Navy Country Club, located in Arlington, VA.

He was the second son of Barisan of Ibelin, and was the younger brother of Hugh of Ibelin and older brother of Balian of Ibelin. He first appears in the historical record as a witness to charters in 1148. In 1156, he may have planned to kill Ahmad ib. Muhammad ibn Qudama of Jamma'in. Ahmad's sermons had been gaining support throughout the region but after being warned of the threat against his life, he fled to Damascus, followed by other members of the Hanbali group. After the death of his eldest brother Hugh (third husband of Agnes of Courtenay) in 1169, the castle of Ibelin passed to Baldwin, who remained Lord of Mirabel and Ramla and passed Ibelin to his younger brother Balian. He introduced the Lusignan family to court in 1174, in the person of Amalric of Lusignan, who had married his daughter Eschiva. Baldwin and Balian supported Raymond III of Tripoli over Miles of Plancy as regent for King Baldwin IV in 1174, and in 1177 the brothers were present at the Battle of Montgisard. It is suspected that, after the death of his second wife Isabella, in 1177, he became Raymond of Tripoli's favoured candidate to marry the widowed Princess Sibylla of Jerusalem. His brother Balian had recently married her stepmother, Dowager Queen Maria Comnena. The Chronicle of Ernoul, or Old French Continuation of William of Tyre, partly written by a former squire of Balian, but thirteenth-century in its current form, claims that Baldwin and Sibylla had been in love and exchanged letters during Baldwin's captivity, but this is highly questionable. Baldwin was captured in battle at Marj Uyun in 1179, along with Odo de St Amand, Grand Master of the Templars, and Raymond of Tripoli's stepson, Hugh of Tiberias. Baldwin was ransomed by Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and later in 1180 he visited Constantinople. Supposedly, the emperor sat him in a chair and covered him up to his head in the gold coins that were to be used as his ransom money. During his stay in Constantinople, the emperor died. Baldwin was in Jerusalem at the time of Sibylla's wedding in 1180. Raymond of Tripoli seems to have been planning a coup to marry Sibylla to Baldwin, but the king needed to marry her to a non- native, in order gain support for another crusade from the west. She was married to Guy of Lusignan, younger brother of Baldwin of Ibelin's son-in-law Amalric. That same year, the king betrothed his younger half-sister Isabella of Jerusalem, Balian's stepdaughter, to Humphrey IV of Toron, to further reduce the Ibelins' influence. In 1183 he supported Raymond against Guy, who was by now regent for the ailing Baldwin IV. Lord Baldwin was among the barons who advised the king to crown Sibylla's son Baldwin V in 1183, while Baldwin IV was still alive; this was an attempt to prevent Guy from succeeding as king. Baldwin V became sole king while still a child in 1185, and when the young king died in 1186, Sibylla was crowned queen with Guy as her consort. The Ibelins and Raymond favoured the accession of Isabella, but Humphrey refused to be crowned and cause a civil war, and instead swore allegiance to Sibylla and Guy. All the other barons of the kingdom paid homage to Guy as well, except for Raymond and Baldwin. Baldwin placed his young son Thomas under the care of his brother Balian, and exiled himself to the Principality of Antioch, where he was welcomed with great fanfare. Baldwin considered Guy \\"a madman and a fool\\", and refused to pay homage because his father had not paid homage to Guy's father (i.e., regarding Guy as an upstart incomer, where Baldwin was a native baron). He refused to return to Jerusalem to assist Guy against Saladin, and probably died in his self-imposed exile in 1187. Family Baldwin of Ibelin married three times. His wives were: 1\\\\. Richilde de Bethsan, before or in 1157, divorced and annulled 1174. They had two children: * Thomas d'Ibelin (before 1175 - in or c. 1188), Lord of Ramla, unmarried and without issue * Stephanie d'Ibelin * Eschive d'Ibelin (c. 1160 - Cyprus in Winter, 1196/1197), married Amalric of Lusignan before October 29, 1175; Queen-consort of Cyprus (1194-1196), mother of Hugh I of Cyprus. (After her death, Amalric married Isabella of Jerusalem and became King of Jerusalem.) 2\\\\. Isabelle or Elizabeth Gothman, married 1175, d. 1177 or 1178, no surviving issue. 3\\\\. Marie, daughter of Renier, Constable of Tripoli, m. after April, 1180, d. after 1228, no surviving issue. Another Baldwin of Ibelin was the son of this Baldwin's nephew John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut. ReferencesSources * William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea. E. A.

Jury rigged HMS Prince was a 98-gun second rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 4 July 1788 at Woolwich. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar. Life She saw relatively little action during her career and seems to have been a relatively poor sailer‚Äîshe sailed, according to one observing captain, 'like a haystack.'Maev Kennedy, Trafalgar anniversary resurrects haystack jibe, The Guardian, 23 October 2006. She was not immediately commissioned on the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France, lying in ordinary at Portsmouth in April 1794. Her hull was lengthened in 1796. Trafalgar By 1805 she was in service with the Channel Fleet under Captain Richard Grindall. At the Battle of Trafalgar, in October that year, she was passed by her whole division, and took over two hours to cover the two or three miles to reach the battle. By the time she arrived most of the enemy fleet was in British hands or had fled, leaving few targets for Prince's massive broadsides. She did fire on the Spanish flagship Principe de Asturias and Achille, but was not attacked and suffered no damage or casualties. Whilst engaging Prince, Achille's fore top caught fire, and the next broadside against her brought her blazing main mast down, engulfing the ship in flames. At this point, knowing that Achille's fate was sealed and making the most of his unique position, Grindall ceased firing and wore round to clear her, before placing boats in the water to rescue French seamen from Achille and elsewhere. This proved hazardous: Achille's abandoned but loaded guns were set off by the intense heat now raging below decks, and she exploded at 5:45 pm, by which point only 100 men had been rescued from her. Nonetheless, Prince and nearby British ships were able to rescue hundreds of sailors from the water. In the week of ferocious storms which followed the battle the sturdy Prince was invaluable, providing replacement stores to more battered ships, towing those that needed it, and saving many men from the heavily-damaged other ships. She and the other undamaged British ships saved many others that would otherwise have sunk and at one point saved 350 men from the sinking Sant√≠ssima Trinidad who would otherwise have drowned, taking them to Gibraltar. Upon arrival there, however, she was ready to sail again in a matter of hours. Later life After the war she remained in Portsmouth until withdrawn from service and was broken up in 1837.

It includes strong elements of Islamic law which have brought it praise from Islamists and condemnation from secularists and feminists. History The regulations imposed by the Family Code were in stark contrast to the role that women had during the struggle for liberation that Algeria faced. During this struggle, National Liberation Front FLN ensured the equality of men and women. This is reflected in the 1976 Algerian Constitution. These rights slowly started to diminish as in 1980, a ministerial order prohibiting women from travelling unaccompanied by a male relative was passed.http://www.wluml.org/sites/wluml.org/files/paper%20on%20algerian-women- family-code.pdf The Algerian Family Code is a document that governs marriage and property rights of Algeria. It contains specifications which were e based on Islamic traditions and is, according to the United Nations, ‚Äúinformed directly by the Islamic law ‚ÄúFiqh‚Äù. The introduction of a Family Code allowed for restrictions which were contradictory to the role of women during the Algerian war for independence (1954‚Äì1962) to be present. In 1996, Algeria ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and stated that they would aim to counter ‚Äúdiscrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations [‚Ä¶],‚Äù https://www.ecoi.net/en/file/local/1411189/90_1507641351_coi-focus-algeria- forced-marriage-20161116.pdf but in the condition that the convention followed the regulations in the pre-existing Family Code: ‚ÄúThe Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria declares that the provisions of article 16 concerning equal rights for men and women in all matters relating to marriage, both during marriage and at its dissolution, should not contradict the provisions of the Algerian Family Code.‚Äù.https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/MTDSG/Volume%20I/Chapter%20IV/IV-8.fr.pdf This had caused criticism by individuals including theorist Zahia Smail Salhi. Its critics particularly focus on its implications for women (who have less right to divorce than men, and who receive smaller shares of inheritance) and sometimes for apostates (who are disinherited, and whose marriages may be nullified.) President Abdelaziz Bouteflika declared that the Family Code must be revised in the spirit of universal human rights and Islamic law. Reactions were mixed. Lachhab of the Islamist El Islah party declared that \\"We oppose these amendments which are contrary to Sharia, and thus to article 2 of the Constitution,\\" whereas Nouria Hafsi of the pro-government RND declared \\"These timid amendments put forward a modern reading of the Sharia; the rights of women will finally be recognized by law. As of early 2005 it has not been changed. Marriage Marriage is defined as a legal contract between a man and a woman. The legal age of marriage is 21 for a man, 18 for a woman; judges may in special cases allow earlier marriage. A man may marry up to four wives; if so, he must treat them equally and inform them in advance, and they may demand a divorce. Marriage requires the consent of both parties and a gift by the groom of a dowry to the bride, as well as the presence of the bride's father or guardian (wali) and of two witnesses. The father of the bride may block the marriage, although her guardian may not. The marriage must be registered before a notary or legal functionary. Marriage is forbidden between close relatives by descent, marriage, or nursing: thus a man may not marry his mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepmother-in-law, or stepdaughter-in-law, nor may he marry anyone who suckled from the same woman as he did, or from whom he suckled. A man may not be married to two sisters simultaneously. Marriage is also forbidden between a couple who have divorced each other for the third time, unless the wife has since been married to someone else. A Muslim woman may not marry a non-Muslim man, and a marriage may be annulled on the grounds of the spouse's apostasy. A husband is required to provide for his wife to the best of his abilities, and to treat his wives equally if he marries more than one. A wife is required to obey her husband and respect him as head of the family, to bring up and nurse his children, and to respect his parents and relatives. A wife has the right to visit her parents and to receive visits from them, and has rights over her own property. Adoption is forbidden: a child may be brought up as part of the family, but must be considered the child of its natural parents, that is what Islamic law calls Kafala. Divorce The husband may divorce his wife at will; if he is judged to have abused this privilege, his wife may be awarded damages, and he must provide for his divorced wife and her children if she has no family to go to, unless she had previously divorced or was guilty of immorality. The wife may request a divorce if any of the following apply: **her husband has failed to provide for her; **her husband is impotent; **her husband has refused to have sex with her for over 4 months; **her husband has been condemned to a dishonorable imprisonment of over a year's length; **her husband has been absent for over a year without a good reason; **her husband has failed to fulfill his legal duties towards her; **her husband is guilty of grave immorality. If she obtains the divorce, she must pay reparations not to exceed the value of the dowry, and may not remarry until three menstrual periods have elapsed, or, if pregnant, until her baby's birth. In case of the father's absence or of divorce, custody of the child goes to his mother, or failing that his maternal grandmother or aunt, or failing that his father or paternal grandfather, or some other relative. A child's guardian must bring the child up in the religion of the child's father. A child brought up by a guardian attains independence at 10 (if male), or at marriage (if female). The Family Code of 1984 condemned non-marital rape yet allowed for marital rape to continue to be decriminalised. Officially, women had the status of full citizens and were equal to men. In 2005, Algeria made a step forward by allowing custody of the children to the mother in case of divorce, and obliged the father to provide some remuneration for the upbringing. Before this change, custody of children would go automatically to the father, with no right of appeal. However, Article 56 of the Code grants custody of the children to the father if the mother remarries, a section that failed to be removed in the 2005 revision and does not apply to the same situation for the male counterpart. Much like the law condemning violence against women, there exists a loophole that could easily void all progress made in parliament, a loophole held open by societal pressures. Keeping the remarriage clause would unable once more the father to gain full custody, taking into account that voluntarily unmarried women in Algeria are seen as ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù and functioning in society without a husband is extremely inconvenient considering the astounding amount of male-oriented bureaucracy and systemic discrimination. Revolts against Family Code In her text, Algerian Women, Citizenship and the 'Family Code', Zahia Smail Salhi looks at the efforts taken by women to contest the family code. She draws on experiences of women at that time to note that men were generally absent in this struggle.http://www.wluml.org/sites/wluml.org/files/paper%20on%20algerian- women-family-code.pdf Since 1984, younger generations of women have joined the fight against the family code. This has led to some revisions to be made.

He was lord of Ibelin from 1170-1193. As the leader of the defense of the city during the siege of Jerusalem in 1187, he surrendered Jerusalem to Saladin on October 2, 1187.  Early Years  Balian was the youngest son of Barisan of Ibelin, and brother of Hugh and Baldwin. His father, a knight in the County of Jaffa, had been rewarded with the lordship of Ibelin after the revolt of Hugh II of Le Puiset. Barisan married Helvis of Ramla, heiress of the wealthy lordship of Ramla. Balian's name was also Barisan, but he seems to have adapted the name to the Old French \\"Balian\\" c. 1175‚Äì76; he is sometimes known as Balian the Younger or Balian II when his father is also referred to as Balian. He is also called Balian of Ramla or Balian of Nablus. In Latin his name appears variously as Balian, Barisan, Barisanus, Balianus, Balisan, and Balisanus. Arabic sources call him Balian ibn Barzan which translates \\"Balian, son of Barzan‚Äù. His precise year of birth is unknown, but he was of the age of majority (usually 15) by 1158, when he first appears in charters, having been described as under-age (\\"infra annos\\") in 1156. After the death of Balian's eldest brother Hugh c. 1169, the castle of Ibelin passed to the next brother, Baldwin. Baldwin, preferring to remain lord of Ramla, gave it to Balian. Balian held Ibelin as a vassal of his brother, and indirectly as a rear-vassal of the king, from whom Baldwin held Ramla. Succession disputes Baldwin supported Raymond III of Tripoli over Miles of Plancy as regent for King Baldwin IV in 1174, and in 1177 the brothers were present at the Battle of Montgisard, leading the vanguard victoriously against the strongest point of the Muslim line. That year Balian also married Maria Comnena, widow of King Amalric I, becoming stepfather to Amalric's younger daughter Isabella. He received the lordship of Nablus, which had been a dower gift to Maria following her marriage to Amalric. In 1179, Baldwin of Ramla was captured by Saladin after the Battle of Jacob's Ford, and Balian helped arrange for his ransom and release the next year; the ransom was eventually paid by Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, Maria's great-uncle. In 1183 Balian and Baldwin supported Raymond against Guy of Lusignan, husband of Amalric's elder daughter Sibylla and by now regent for Baldwin IV, who was dying of leprosy. The king had his 5-year-old nephew Baldwin of Montferrat crowned as co-king in his own lifetime, in an attempt to prevent Guy from ascending. Shortly before his death in spring 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It was Balian himself‚Äîa notably tall man‚Äîwho carried the child Baldwin V on his shoulder at the ceremony, signifying the support of Isabella's family for her nephew. Soon after, the eight-year-old boy became sole king. When he, too, died in 1186, Balian and Maria, with Raymond's support, put forward Maria's daughter Isabella, then about 14, as a candidate for the throne. However, her husband, Humphrey IV of Toron, refused the crown and swore fealty to Guy. Balian reluctantly also paid homage to Guy, while his brother refused to do so and exiled himself to Antioch. Baldwin placed Balian in charge of raising his son Thomas, the future lord of Ramla, who did not go with his father to Antioch. Dispute between Raymond and Guy Balian remained in the kingdom, as an advisor to Guy. At the end of 1186, Saladin, the sultan of Egypt and Damascus, threatened the borders of the kingdom after Guy's ally Raynald of Ch√¢tillon, Lord of Oultrejordain, had attacked a Muslim caravan. Saladin was allied with the garrison of Tiberias in the north of the kingdom, a territory held by Raymond III. Guy gathered his army at Nazareth, planning to besiege Tiberias, but Balian disagreed with this, and instead suggested that Guy send an emissary to Raymond in Tripoli, hoping the two could be reconciled before Guy made a foolish attack on Saladin's larger army. The first embassy was a failure and the situation remained unchanged throughout the early months of 1187. After Easter of that year, Balian, Gerard of Ridefort (Grand Master of the Knights Templar), Roger de Moulins (Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller), Reginald of Sidon, and Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre were sent on a new embassy to Tripoli. During the journey they stopped at Balian's fief of Nablus, and Balian planned to remain behind briefly while the others went ahead. On May 1, the Templars and Hospitallers were defeated by Saladin's son al-Afdal at the Battle of Cresson; Balian was still a day behind, and had also stopped at Sebastea to celebrate a feast day. After reaching the castle of La F√®ve, where the Templars and Hospitallers had camped, he found that the place was deserted, and soon heard news of the disastrous battle from the few survivors. Raymond heard about the battle as well and met the embassy at Tiberias, and agreed to accompany them back to Jerusalem. The Battle of Hattin Since al- Afdal's army had been allowed to enter the kingdom through their alliance with Raymond, the count now regretted his actions and reconciled with Guy. Guy marched north and camped at Sephoria, but insisted on marching the army across a dry and barren plain to relieve Tiberias. The army had no water and was constantly harassed by Saladin's troops, and was finally surrounded at the Horns of Hattin outside Tiberias early in July. In the Battle of Hattin that followed on July 4, Balian and Joscelin III of Edessa commanded the rearguard, but the crusader army was completely defeated. The anonymous text, De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum Libellus claims that Balian, Raymond and Reginald of Sidon fled the field in the middle of the battle, trampling \\"the Christians, the Turks and the Cross\\" in the process‚Äîbut this is not corroborated by other accounts, and likely reflects the author's hostility to the Poleins (a European born in the Levant). The defeat led to a changing of the guard in Jerusalem: King Guy was taken prisoner, and nearly every town and castle soon fell to Saladin. Balian, Raymond, Reginald, and Payen of Haifa were among the few leading nobles who managed to escape to Tyre. Raymond and Reginald soon left to attend to the defence of their own territories, and Tyre came under the leadership of Conrad of Montferrat, Baldwin V's paternal uncle, who had arrived not long after Hattin. Balian was to become one of his closest allies. Leaving Tyre, Balian asked Saladin for permission to return through the lines to Jerusalem to escort his wife and their children to Tripoli. Saladin allowed this, provided that Balian leave the city and take an oath to never raise arms against him. Defense of Jerusalem Balian of Ibelin surrendering the city of Jerusalem to Saladin, from Les Passages faits Outremer par les Fran√ßais contre les Turcs et autres Sarrasins et Maures outremarins, c. 1490. When Balian and his small group of knights arrived in the city, the inhabitants begged them to stay, and Balian was absolved of his oath to Saladin by Patriarch Eraclius, who argued that the greater need of Christendom was stronger than his oath to a non-Christian. Balian was recruited to lead the defense of the city, but he found that there were under fourteen, possibly as few as two, other knights there, so he created 60 new knights from the ranks of the burgesses. Queen Sibylla seems to have played little part in the defence, and oaths were taken to Balian as lord. With Eraclius, he prepared for the inevitable siege by storing food and money. Saladin indeed began the siege of Jerusalem on September 20, 1187, after he had conquered almost all of the rest of the kingdom, including Ibelin, Nablus, Ramla, and Ascalon. The sultan felt no ill-will to Balian for breaking his oath, and arranged for an escort to accompany Maria and their children to Tripoli. As the highest ranking lord remaining in Jerusalem, Balian, as Ibn al-Athir wrote, was seen by the Muslims as holding a rank \\"more or less equal to that of a king.\\" Saladin was able to knock down portions of the walls, but was unable to gain entrance to the city. Balian then rode out to meet with the sultan, to report to him that the defenders would rather kill each other and destroy the city than see it taken by force. After negotiations, it was decided that the city would be handed over peacefully, and that Saladin would free seven thousand men for 30,000 bezants; two women or ten children would be permitted to take the place of one man for the same price. Balian handed over the keys to the Tower of David (the citadel) on October 2. There was a 50-day period for the payment of ransoms. Those who could not pay for their freedom were forced into slavery; Saladin freed some of them, however, and allowed for an orderly march away from Jerusalem, preventing the sort of massacre that had occurred when the Crusaders captured the city in 1099. Balian and Patriarch Eraclius had offered themselves as hostages for the ransoming of the remaining Frankish citizens, but Saladin had refused. The ransomed inhabitants marched away in three columns. Balian and the Patriarch led the third, which was the last to leave the city, probably around November 20. Balian joined his wife and children in Tripoli. Balian as king-maker, and the Third Crusade The fall of Jerusalem, and the death of Sibylla at the Siege of Acre in 1190, led to a dispute over the throne of the kingdom. Balian's stepdaughter Isabella was now rightful queen, but Guy refused to concede his title, and Isabella's husband Humphrey‚Äîwho had let her cause down in 1186‚Äîremained loyal to him. If Isabella were to succeed, she needed a politically acceptable and militarily competent husband, the obvious candidate being Conrad of Montferrat, who also had some claim as Baldwin V's paternal uncle. Balian and Maria seized Isabella and talked her into agreeing to a divorce. There were precedents: the annulment of Amalric I's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, and the unsuccessful attempts to force Sibylla to divorce Guy. Isabella's marriage was annulled by Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, who was Papal legate, and Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais. The Bishop of Beauvais then married her to Conrad (controversially, since his brother had been married to her half-sister and it was uncertain whether he had been divorced by his Byzantine wife). The succession dispute was prolonged by the arrival of Richard I of England and Philip II of France on the Third Crusade: Richard supported Guy, as a Poitevin vassal, while Philip supported Conrad, his late father's cousin. Balian and Maria's role in Isabella's divorce and their support for Conrad as king earned them the bitter hatred of Richard and his supporters. Ambroise, who wrote a poetic account of the crusade, called Balian \\"more false than a goblin\\" and said he \\"should be hunted with dogs\\". The anonymous author of the Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi wrote that Balian was a member of a \\"council of consummate iniquity\\" around Conrad, accused him of taking Conrad's bribes, and said of Maria and Balian as a couple: :Steeped in Greek filth from the cradle, she had a husband whose morals matched her own: he was cruel, she was godless; he was fickle, she was pliable; he was faithless, she was fraudulent. On 28 April 1192, only days after his kingship was confirmed by election, Conrad was assassinated in Tyre. It is said that one of the two assassins responsible had entered Balian's household in Tyre some months previously, pretending to be a servant, in order to stalk his victim; the other may have similarly infiltrated Reginald of Sidon's or Conrad's own household. Richard was widely suspected of involvement in the murder. Isabella, who was expecting her first child (Maria of Montferrat), married Henry II of Champagne only a week later. Balian became one of Henry's advisors, and later that year (along with William of Tiberias), he commanded the rearguard of Richard's army at the Battle of Jaffa of 1192. Later, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Jaffa in 1192 between Richard and Saladin, essentially ending the crusade. Under this treaty, Ibelin remained under Saladin's control, but many sites along the coast which had been reconquered during the crusade were allowed to remain in Christian hands. After Richard departed, Saladin compensated Balian with the castle of Caymont and five other nearby sites, all outside Acre.  Legacy  Balian died in 1193, in his early fifties. With Maria Komnene he had four children: * Helvis of Ibelin, who married (1) Reginald of Sidon; (2) Guy of Montfort. * John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut and constable of Jerusalem, and regent for his niece Maria of Montferrat, Queen of Jerusalem. He married (1) Helvis of Nephin; (2) Melisende of Arsuf. * Margaret, who married (1) Hugh II of Saint Omer (stepson of Raymond III of Tripoli); (2) Walter III of C√¶sarea. * Philip of Ibelin, Regent of Cyprus, who married Alice of Montb√©liard, and sired John of Ibelin, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon Balian's squire Ernoul, who was with him on the embassy to Tripoli in 1187, wrote parts of the Old French continuation of the Latin chronicle of William of Tyre (William had died in 1186, before the fall of Jerusalem). Although this family of manuscripts now often bears his name, his account survives in only fragments within it, mainly for the period 1186‚Äì88, with a heavy bias in favour of the Ibelin family. Balian became a common name in the Ibelin family in the 13th century. Balian, lord of Beirut, son of John and grandson of the above Balian, succeeded his father as lord of Beirut in 1236. Balian of Beirut's brother, also named John, had a son named Balian; this Balian was lord of Arsuf and married Plaisance of Antioch. The name also passed into the family of the Greniers of Sidon, since Balian's daughter Helvis and Reginald of Sidon named their son Balian.

Ivan Isayevich Bolotnikov () (1565-1608) was the leader of a popular uprising in Russia in 1606‚Äì1607 known as the Bolotnikov Rebellion (–í–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ë–æ–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞). The uprising was part of the Time of Troubles in Russia. Early life Little information is available about Ivan Bolotnikov's life before the uprising. It is known that he was a kholop and belonged to the household of Prince Andrei Telyatevsky. It appears that Bolotnikov fled from his master's estate, then was captured by the Crimean Tatars, and sold to the Turks as a galley slave. He somehow managed to escape from his owners, reached Venice, and then was captured in Poland en route to Russia by the associates of Mikhail Molchanov (one of the assassins of Feodor Godunov, who had successfully fled from Moscow and was again contemplating the second coming of False Dmitry). Rebellion Molchanov sent Ivan Bolotnikov to the town of Putyvl to meet a voyevoda named Grigory Shakhovskoy. The latter received him as the new tsar‚Äôs envoy and put him in charge of a Cossack unit. Ivan Bolotnikov used this opportunity to muster a small army of runaway kholops, peasants, outlaws, and vagabonds, disgruntled with social and economic situation in Russia. He promised them to exterminate the ruling class and establish a new social system. By the order of Grigory Shakhovskoy, Bolotnikov and his army advanced to Kromy (today's Oryol Oblast) in August 1606, defeating the Muscovite army under the command of Prince Yury Trubetskoy. From there, he moved towards Serpukhov and ravaged the city. Rebels united At the time there were several other rebellions taking place across Russia, the participants of which would join Ivan Bolotnikov's army. Most of the insurgents (Cossacks, gentry, service class people, and even boyar children) organized themselves into three main groups under the command of Grigory Sumbulov, Prokopy Lyapunov, and Istoma Pashkov. All these rebels united and besieged Moscow, settling in a village of Zagorye on October 12, 1606. The consensus among these rebellious groups, however, did not last long. Soon, the noblemen realized that most of Ivan Bolotnikov's plans had really been aimed against them, so they figured it would be much safer to return their support to Vasili Shuisky. Breakup On November 15, Sumbulov and Lyapunov left Zagorye and gave themselves up to the authorities, asking the tsar for forgiveness. Now that Bolotnikov's army had lost some of its men, Vasili Shuisky decided to make his move. On December 2, Prince Mikhail Skopin- Shuisky (tsar's cousin) attacked the enemy near Kolomenskoye. During the battle, Istoma Pashkov and his men decided to switch camps and joined the Muscovite army. Left all by himself, Ivan Bolotnikov suffered a defeat and fled to Kaluga. Vasili Shuisky's commanders Fyodor Mstislavsky and Ivan Shuisky laid siege to the city, but Bolotnikov and his Cossacks managed to repel their attacks until the end of winter. Help from Prince Andrei Telyatevsky In the spring of 1607, another imposter by the name of False Peter (also known as Ileyka Muromets; he claimed to be the son of Feodor I of Russia) came to Tula with a whole mob of robbers to meet with Prince Grigory Shakhovskoy. Immediately after this, the latter dispatched Prince Andrei Telyatevsky and his men to help out Ivan Bolotnikov, forcing Prince Mstislavsky to lift the siege of Kaluga. Bolotnikov moved to Tula. Thus, all the rebels met together in one place, their joint forces numbering some 30,000 people. It was then that Vasili Shuisky decided to attack all of them at once and left Moscow on May 21, 1607. He besieged Tula, but the insurgents managed to hold out until October despite deprivations and hunger. Bolotnikov sent letters to False Dmitry II in Starodub asking for help, but to no avail. Surrender and death Finally, Bolotnikov decided to negotiate his surrender. The tsar promised to pardon the insurgents in return for Tula. On October 10, the rebels surrendered to the authorities. Shuisky, however, did not keep his promise. Instead, he transported all of the rebel leaders to Moscow on October 30, and then executed each of them in a different way. Ivan Bolotnikov was transported to Kargopol, blinded and then drowned.

It is the only member of the genus Pitangus. It breeds in open woodland with some tall trees, including cultivation and around human habitation, mainly found in Belize, and from the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas and northern Mexico south to Argentina and Uruguay, but also it occurs all over Venezuela and Brazil (especially the central and south- southeastern regions), Paraguay and central Argentina, the Guyana coastline, and on Trinidad. It was introduced to Bermuda in 1957, and to Tobago in about 1970. Taxonomy= Etymology  The great kiskadee was described and illustrated in 1648 by the German naturalist Georg Marcgrave in the Historia Naturalis Brasiliae. He used the name Pitangua-guacu, the word for a large flycatcher in the Tupi language. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the species in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. He used the French name La Pie- Griesche jaune de Cayenne and the Latin name Lanius Cayanensis Luteus. The two stars (**) at the start of the paragraph indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. At one time, the bird was also known as the Derby Flycatcher. When the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition in 1766 he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson in his Ornithologie. One of these was the great kiskadee. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name Lanius sulphuratus and cited Brisson's work. The specific name sulphuratus is Latin for \\"sulphur\\". The word had been used by Brisson in describing the yellow colour of the underparts of the bird. The genus Pitangus was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827. The great kiskadee is now the only member of the genus. The lesser kiskadee was at one time also placed in Pitangus but in 1984 the American ornithologist Wesley Edwin Lanyon moved the lesser kiskadee to its own monotypic genus Philohydor. This has been accepted by some ornithologists, but not all. There are 10 subspecies: * P. s. texanus van Rossem, 1940 ‚Äì south Texas to east Mexico * P. s. derbianus (Kaup, 1852) ‚Äì west Mexico * P. s. guatimalensis (Lafresnaye, 1852) ‚Äì southeast Mexico to central Panama * P. s. rufipennis (Lafresnaye, 1851) ‚Äì north Colombia and north Venezuela * P. s. caucensis Chapman, 1914 ‚Äì west and south Colombia * P. s. trinitatis Hellmayr, 1906 ‚Äì east Colombia, south and east Venezuela and northwest Brazil, Trinidad * P. s. sulphuratus (Linnaeus, 1766) ‚Äì the Guianas and north, west, central Amazonian Brazil, southeast Colombia and east Ecuador to southeast Peru * P. s. maximiliani (Cabanis & Heine, 1859) ‚Äì north, east Bolivia and west, central Paraguay to east and south Brazil * P. s. bolivianus (Lafresnaye, 1852) ‚Äì central Bolivia * P. s. argentinus Todd, 1952 ‚Äì east Paraguay, southeast Brazil and Uruguay to central Argentina Description The adult great kiskadee is one of the largest of the tyrant flycatchers. It is in length and weighs . The head is black with a strong white supercilium and a concealed yellow crown stripe. The upperparts are brown, and the wings and tail are brown with usually strong rufous fringes. The bill is short, thick, and black in color. The similar boat-billed flycatcher (Megarynchus pitangua) has a more massive black bill, an olive-brown back and very little rufous in the tail and wings. A few other tyrant flycatchers ‚Äî the social flycatcher (Myiozetetes similis), for example ‚Äî share a similar color pattern, but these species are markedly smaller. The call is an exuberant BEE-tee-WEE, and the bird has an onomatopoeic name in different languages and countries: In Brazil its popular name is bem-te-vi (\\"I saw you well\\") and in Spanish-speaking countries it is often bien-te-veo (\\"I see you well\\") and sometimes shortened to benteveo. Distribution and habitat The great kiskadee occupies a wide range of habitats, from open grassland with scattered trees to urban areas. Its range extends from the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas south through Central America to southern Argentina. It does not occur in Chile. The great kiskadee was introduced to Bermuda in 1957. Two hundred birds were imported from Trinidad in an attempt to control the number of lizards, especially the tree lizard (Anolis grahami) which had itself been introduced. The birds bred successfully and by 1976 the population on the island had expanded to around 60,000. The link is to a 99 MB pdf containing 1102 pages. The article begins on page 775. The great kiskadee is omnivorous and has failed to control the number of lizards. Behaviour and ecology The opportunistic behavior of the great kiskadee allows for it to flourish in most Latin American urban areas. Here a kiskadee is feeding out of an unguarded bowl of dog food. (Granada, Nicaragua) The great kiskadee is a common, noisy and conspicuous bird. It is almost omnivorous and hunts like a shrike or flycatcher, waiting on an open perch high in a tree to sally out and catch insects in flight or to pounce upon rodents and similar small vertebrates. It will also take prey and some fruit like tamanqueiro (Alchornea glandulosa) or gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba): Pascotto (2006), Foster (2007). from vegetation by gleaning and jumping for it or ripping it off in mid-hover, and occasionally dives for fish or tadpoles in shallow water, making it one of the few fishing passerines. Kiskadees like to hunt on their own or in pairs, and though they might be expected to make good use of prey flushed by but too large for the smaller birds of the understory, they do not seem to join mixed-species feeding flocks very often. When they do, they hunt in the familiar manner. Such opportunistic feeding behavior makes it one of the commonest birds in urban areas around Latin America; its flashy belly and its shrill call make it one of the most conspicuous.Machado (1999), de A. Gabriel & Pizo (2005), Pascotto (2006) Breeding Great kiskadees are monogamous and defend a territory. Both sexes build the large domed nest that has a side entrance. It is chiefly composed of grasses and small twigs but can also incorporate lichen, string and plastic. The birds will steal material from other nests. The nest is placed in a wide range of sites, often in an exposed position high up in a tree or on man-made structures. Occasionally the nest is placed in a cavity. The clutch is 3 to 4 eggs. These are moderately glossy, light yellowish cream in colour with purplish black and purplish brown spots. The average size is . Only the female incubates the eggs; the male guards the nest while she leaves the nest to feed. The eggs hatch after 16‚Äì17 days. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge after 17‚Äì18 days. mobs a hawk. Food and feeding This alert and aggressive bird has a strong and maneuverable flight, which it uses to good effect when it feels annoyed by raptors. Even much larger birds are attacked by the great kiskadee, usually by diving down or zooming straight at them while they are in mid-air. Harsh calls are also often given during these attacks, alerting all potential prey in the area of the predator's presence. If not very hungry, any raptor subject to a great kiskadee's mobbing behavior is likely to leave, as it is well-nigh impossible to make a good catch when subject to the tyrant flycatcher's unwelcome attention. In general, avian predators are liable to steer clear of an alert great kiskadee, lest their hunting success be spoiled, and will hunt the great kiskadee itself - though it is as meaty as a fat thrush - only opportunistically. Zooming straight in mid-air Myiozetetes similis To mammalian and squamate predators that can sneak up to nesting or sleeping birds, it is more vulnerable however. Even omnivorous mammals as small as the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) will try to plunder great kiskadee nests - at least during the dry season when fruits are scarce - despite the birds' attempts to defend their offspring.de Lyra-Neves et al. (2007) One of two birds studied in the Parque Nacional de La Macarena of Colombia was parasitized by microfilariae.Basto et al.

Also, its feeding mostly on live prey makes it extremely difficult to keep in captivity.

During the Yayoi period, rice cultivation began in the flatter lands of present-day Okutama, but most of the area remained covered by forests and only small flat lands existed.Introduction to Okutama Premodern period During the Edo period, the area included in present-day Okutama was divided into 16 villages within Musashi Province. In each village, there was one person who served as the mayor, another who served as the leader of a particular group, and another who served as a representative for the farmers. Also, entering Mount Takanosu was forbidden for people of low rank during this time. This was because the people of high rank (government officials and such) hunted with hawks at the mountain, and the officials wanted to keep the hunting grounds for themselves. Modern Times With the start of the Meiji period, the area of Okutama became part of Nirayama Prefecture except for Kotaba village, which was merged into Maebashi Domain, which then became part of Gunma Prefecture. While Kotaba village was turned into part of Maebashi city, the Okutama area was divided into three villages of Hikawa, Kori, and Ogouchi with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. In 1940, Hikawa was elevated to town status. In 1955, Hikawa town, Ogouchi village and Kori village were united, forming the town of Okutama. Economy Seasonal tourism, forestry and charcoal production are mainstays of the local economy. Education Okutama has two elementary and two middle schools. The town does not have a high school.

Launched in 1798, she served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought only one fleet action, the Battle of Trafalgar, but became so well known for that action and her subsequent depictions in art and literature that she has been remembered as The Fighting Temeraire. Built at Chatham Dockyard, Temeraire entered naval service on the Brest blockade with the Channel Fleet. Missions were tedious and seldom relieved by any action with the French fleet. The first incident of note came when several of her crew, hearing rumours they were to be sent to the West Indies at a time when peace with France seemed imminent, refused to obey orders. This act of mutiny eventually failed and a number of those responsible were tried and executed. Laid up during the Peace of Amiens, Temeraire returned to active service with the resumption of the wars with France, again serving with the Channel Fleet, and joined Horatio Nelson's blockade of the Franco-Spanish fleet in Cadiz in 1805. At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, the ship went into action immediately astern of Nelson's flagship, . During the battle Temeraire came to the rescue of the beleaguered Victory, and fought and captured two French ships, winning public renown in Britain. After undergoing substantial repairs, Temeraire was employed blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She went out to the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up. This final voyage was depicted in a J. M. W. Turner oil painting greeted with critical acclaim, entitled The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838. The painting continues to be held in high regard: it was voted Britain's favourite painting in a BBC radio poll in 2005 and it appears briefly in the James Bond movie Skyfall. A reproduction of the painting appears on the back of the Bank of England ¬£20 note issued in 2020. Construction and commissioning Navy Office and dated 22 July 1789. Temeraire was ordered from Chatham Dockyard on 9 December 1790, to a design developed by Surveyor of the Navy Sir John Henslow. She was one of three ships of the Neptune class, alongside her sisters and . She was primarily made from English oak from nearby Hainault Forest.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p. 217 The keel was laid down at Chatham in July 1793. Her construction was initially overseen by Master Shipwright Thomas Pollard and completed by his successor Edward Sison. Temeraire was launched in the rain on Tuesday 11 September 1798 and the following day was taken into the graving dock to be fitted for sea. Her hull was fitted with copper sheathing, a process that took two weeks to complete. Refloated, she finished fitting out, and received her masts and yards. Her final costs came to ¬£73,241, and included ¬£59,428 spent on the hull, masts and yards, and a further ¬£13,813 on rigging and stores. She was commissioned on 21 March 1799 under Captain Peter Puget, becoming the second ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Temeraire. Her predecessor had been the 74-gun third-rate , a former French ship taken as a prize at the Battle of Lagos on 19 August 1759 by a fleet under Admiral Edward Boscawen. Puget was in command only until 26 July 1799, during which time he oversaw the process of fitting the new Temeraire for sea. He was superseded by Captain Thomas Eyles on 27 July 1799, while the vessel was anchored off St Helens, Isle of Wight. With the Channel Fleet Under Eyles's command Temeraire finally put to sea at the end of July, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, and joined the Channel Fleet under the overall command of Admiral Lord Bridport. The Channel Fleet was at that time principally engaged in the blockade of the French port of Brest, and Temeraire spent several long cruises of two or three months at a time patrolling the area. Eyles was superseded during this period by Temeraires former commander, Captain Puget, who resumed command on 14 October 1799, and the following month Temeraire became the flagship of Rear Admiral James Whitshed. Lord Bridport had been replaced as commander of the Channel Fleet by Admiral Lord St Vincent in mid-1799, and the long blockade cruises were sustained throughout the winter and into the following year. On 20 April 1800 Puget was superseded as commander by Captain Edward Marsh. Marsh commanded Temeraire through the remainder of that year and for the first half of 1801, until his replacement, Captain Thomas Eyles, arrived to resume command on 31 August. Rear Admiral Whitshed had also struck his flag by now, and Temeraire became the flagship of Rear Admiral George Campbell. By this time the Second Coalition against France had collapsed, and negotiations for peace were underway at Amiens. Lord St Vincent had been promoted to First Lord of the Admiralty, and command of the Channel Fleet passed to Admiral Sir William Cornwallis. With the end of the war imminent, Temeraire was taken off blockade duty and sent to Bantry Bay to await the arrival of a convoy, which she would then escort to the West Indies. Many of the crew had been serving continuously in the navy since the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, and had looked forward to returning to England now that peace seemed imminent. On hearing rumours that instead they were to be sent to the West Indies, around a dozen men began to agitate for the rest of the crew to refuse orders to sail for anywhere but England. Mutiny The first open clash between the mutineers and officers came on the morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined that the majority of the crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could. Alarmed by the actions of Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the following day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols. News of the mutiny created a sensation in England, and the Admiralty ordered Temeraire to sail immediately for Spithead while an investigation was carried out. Vice-Admiral Mitchell was granted extraordinary powers regarding the death sentence and Temeraires complement of marines was hastily augmented for the voyage to England. On the ship's arrival, the 14 imprisoned ringleaders were swiftly court-martialled in Portsmouth aboard , some on 6 January 1802 and the rest on 14 January. After deliberations, twelve were sentenced to be hanged at the yardarm, and the remaining two were to receive two hundred lashes each. Four men were duly hanged aboard Temeraire, and the remainder were hanged aboard several of the ships anchored at Portsmouth, including , , and . A further seven men involved were sent to prison hulks for life.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p. 219 West Indies and the peace After the executions, Temeraire was immediately sent to sea, sailing from Portsmouth for the Isle of Wight the day after and beginning preparations for her delayed voyage to the West Indies. She sailed for Barbados, arriving there on 24 February, and remained in the West Indies until the summer. During her time there the Treaty of Amiens was finally signed and ratified, and Temeraire was ordered back to Britain. She arrived at Plymouth on 28 September and Eyles paid her off on 5 October. Because of the drawdown in the size of the active navy as a result of the peace, Temeraire was laid up in the Hamoaze for the next eighteen months. Return to service The peace of Amiens was a brief interlude in the wars with Revolutionary France, and in 1803 the War of the Third Coalition began. Temeraire had deteriorated substantially during her long period spent laid up, and she was taken into dry dock on 22 May to repair and refit, starting with the replacement of her copper sheathing. Work was delayed when a heavy storm hit Plymouth in January 1804, causing appreciable damage to Temeraire, but was finally completed by February 1804, at a cost of ¬£16,898. Command was assigned to Captain Eliab Harvey, and he arrived to take up his commission on 1 January 1804. The crew were largely from Liverpool. They left Cawsand Bay on 11 March 1804, sailing to join the Channel Fleet off Brest, still under the overall command of Admiral Cornwallis. As a much forgotten part of history, Napoleon had assembled his Grand Army, 160,000 men, near Boulogne as part of a plan to invade England. The bulk of the French navy: 21 ships of the line, were harboured at Brest but were needed for the invasion plan.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p. 220 Temeraire now resumed her previous duties blockading the French at Brest, patrolling between Ushant Island and Cape Finisterre. Heavy weather took its toll, forcing her to put into Torbay for extensive repairs after her long patrols, repairs which eventually amounted to ¬£9,143. During this time Harvey was often absent from his command, usually attending to his duties as Member of Parliament for Essex. He was temporarily replaced by Captain William Kelly on 27 August 1804, and he in turn was succeeded by Captain George Fawke on 6 April 1805. Harvey returned to his ship on 9 July 1805, and it was while he was in command that the reinforced Rochefort squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder intercepted and attacked a Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. The French commander, Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, was thwarted in his attempt to join the French forces at Brest, and instead sailed south to Ferrol, and then to Cadiz. When news of the Franco-Spanish fleet's location reached the Admiralty, they appointed Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson to take command of the blockading force at Cadiz, which at the time was being commanded by Vice- Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Nelson was told to pick whichever ships he liked to serve under him, and one of those he specifically chose was Temeraire. Collingwood replaced Calder on the Temeraire in August 1804.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p. 224 The ship sheltered with the Channel Fleet at Douarnenez Bay during the storms of November 1804. Further winter storms caused her to go to Torbay for repairs in January 1805 and she did not return to the squadron at Brest until April.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p. 225-7 Command returned to Calder again on 16 August 1805 and headed for Ferrol to intercept Admiral Vileneuve and the French fleet. The French unexpectedly turned south and the British fleet followed them down to Cadiz.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p. 228 Battle of Trafalgar Temeraire duly received orders to join the Cadiz blockade, and having sailed to rendezvous with Collingwood, Harvey awaited Nelson's arrival. Nelson's flagship, the 100-gun , arrived off Cadiz on 28 September, and he took over command of the fleet from Collingwood. He spent the next few weeks forming his plan of attack in preparation for the expected sortie of the Franco-Spanish fleet, issuing it to his captains on 9 October in the form of a memorandum. The memorandum called for two divisions of ships to attack at right angles to the enemy line, severing its van from the centre and rear. A third advance squadron would be deployed as a reserve, with the ability to join one of the lines as the course of the battle dictated. Nelson placed the largest and most powerful ships at the heads of the lines, with Temeraire assigned to lead Nelson's own column into battle. The fleet patrolled a considerable distance from the Spanish coast to lure the combined fleet out, and the ships took the opportunity to exercise and prepare for the coming battle. For Temeraire this probably involved painting her sides in the Nelson Chequer design, to enable the British ships to tell friend from foe in the confusion of battle. An 1848 plan of the fleet positions at the Battle of Trafalgar. Temeraire forms part of the weather column, and is depicted abreast of the Victory, racing her for the Franco-Spanish line. The combined Franco- Spanish fleet left Cadiz and put to sea on 19 October 1805, and by 21 October was in sight of the British ships. Nelson formed up his lines and the British began to converge on their distant opponents. Contrary to his original instructions, Nelson took the lead of the weather column in Victory. Concerned for the commander-in-chief's safety in such an exposed position, Henry Blackwood, a long-standing friend of Nelson and commander of the frigate that day, suggested Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe and direct the battle. Nelson refused, so Blackwood instead tried to convince him to let Harvey come past him in the Temeraire, and so lead the column into battle. Nelson agreed to this, and signalled for Harvey to come past him. As Temeraire drew up towards Victory, Nelson decided that if he was standing aside to let another ship lead his line, so too should Collingwood, commanding the lee column of ships. He signalled Collingwood, aboard his flagship , to let another ship come ahead of him, but Collingwood continued to surge ahead. Reconsidering his plan, Nelson is reported to have hailed Temeraire, as she came up alongside Victory, with the words \\"I'll thank you, Captain Harvey, to keep in your proper station, which is astern of the Victory.\\" Nelson's instruction was followed up by a formal signal and Harvey dropped back reluctantly, but otherwise kept within one ship's length of Victory as she sailed up to the Franco-Spanish line. Closely following Victory as she passed through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship , Harvey was forced to sheer away quickly, just missing Victorys stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship Sant√≠sima Trinidad and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun and the 74-gun , as she did so. Redoutables broadside carried away Temeraires mizzen topmast. While avoiding a broadside from Neptune, Temeraire narrowly avoided a collision with Redoutable. Another broadside from Neptune brought down Temeraires fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that Redoutable had come up alongside Victory and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board Victory. Temeraire was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across Redoutables stern, Temeraire discharged a double-shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques √âtienne Lucas, captain of Redoutable, recorded that \\"... the three-decker [Temeraire]who had doubtless perceived that the Victory had ceased fire and would inevitably be takenran foul of the Redoutable to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It would be impossible to describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it.\\" Temeraire and Redoutable The Battle of Trafalgar, 1836 oil on canvas by Clarkson Frederick Stanfield. Stanfield shows the damaged Redoutable caught between Victory (foreground) and Temeraire (seen bow on). Fougueux, coming up on Temeraires starboard side, has just received a broadside. Temeraire then rammed into Redoutable, dismounting many of the French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together. Temeraire now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire as she did so from the 112-gun Spanish ship lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship , which came up on Temeraires un- engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until Fougueux came within point blank range. Temeraires first broadside against Fougueux at a range of caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into Temeraire, whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. Temeraire was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled in a letter to his wife \\"Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her.\\" Redoutable, sandwiched between Victory and Temeraire, suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of Redoutable killed and wounded a number of Temeraires crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. Temeraire narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from Redoutable exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only Temeraire, but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion. After twenty minutes fighting both Victory and Temeraire, Redoutable had been reduced to a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables main mast fell onto her poop deck, and having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship. Temeraire and Fougueux Lashed together, Temeraire and Fougueux exchanged fire, Temeraire initially clearing the French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater height of the three-decked Temeraire compared to the two-decked Fougueux thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which entered Fougueux via her main deck ports and chains. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. Fougueuxs captain, Louis Alexis Baudoin, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander Fran√ßois Bazin in charge. When he learned that nearly all the officers were dead or wounded and that most of the guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders. Temeraire had by now fought both French ships to a standstill, at considerable cost to herself. She had sustained casualties of 47 killed and 76 wounded. All her sails and yards had been destroyed, only her lower masts remained, and the rudder head and starboard cathead had been shot away. of her starboard hull was staved in and both quarter galleries had been destroyed. Harvey signalled for a frigate to tow his damaged ship out of the line, and came up to assist. Before Sirius could make contact, Temeraire came under fire from a counter-attack by the as- yet unengaged van of the combined fleet, led by Rear Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley. Harvey ordered the few guns that could be brought to bear fired in response, and the attack was eventually beaten off by fresh British ships arriving on the scene. Storm Shortly after the battle had ended, a severe gale struck the area. Several of the captured French and Spanish ships foundered in the rising seas, including both of Temeraires prizes, Fougueux and Redoutable. Lost in the wrecks were a considerable number of their crews, as well as 47 Temeraire crewmen, serving as prize crews. Temeraire rode out the storm following the battle, sometimes being taken in tow by less damaged ships, sometimes riding at anchor. She took aboard a number of Spanish and French prisoners transferred from other prizes, including some transferred from Euryalus, which was serving as the temporary flagship of Cuthbert Collingwood, who was now in command as Nelson had been killed during the battle. Harvey took the opportunity to go aboard Euryalus and present his account of the battle to Collingwood, and so became the only captain to do so before Collingwood wrote his dispatch about the victory. Return to England Temeraire finally put into Gibraltar on 2 November, eleven days after the battle had been fought. After undergoing minor repairs she sailed for England, arriving at Portsmouth on 1 December, three days before Victory passed by carrying Nelson's body. The battle-damaged ships quickly became tourist attractions, and visitors flocked to tour them. Temeraire was particularly popular on her arrival, being the only ship singled out by name in Collingwood's dispatch for her heroic conduct. Collingwood wrote: > A circumstance occurred during the action which so strongly marks the > invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their > country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to > their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a > French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was > vigorous, but, in the end the combined ensigns were torn from the poop and > the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report in the immediate aftermath of the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen. \\"Captain Harvey of the Temeraire ... clearing the deck of the French and Spaniards ...\\" A number of artists visited the newly returned Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, sending them to Nicholas Pocock to be used for Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors who had been in the battle. The story of Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of Temeraire. Mediterranean and Baltic service The battle-damaged Temeraire was almost immediately dry-docked in Portsmouth to undergo substantial repairs, which eventually lasted sixteen months and cost ¬£25,352. She finally left the dockyard in mid-1807, now under the command of Captain Sir Charles Hamilton. Having fitted her for sea, Hamilton sailed to the Mediterranean in September and joined the fleet blockading the French in Toulon. The service was largely uneventful, and Temeraire returned to Britain in April 1808 to undergo repairs at Plymouth. During her time in Britain the strategic situation in Europe changed as Spain rebelled against French domination and entered the war against France. Temeraire sailed in June to join naval forces operating off the Spanish coast in support of anti-French forces in the Peninsular War. This service continued until early 1809, when she returned to Britain. By now Britain was heavily involved in the Baltic, protecting mercantile interests. An expedition under Sir James Gambier in July 1807 had captured most of the Danish Navy at the Second Battle of Copenhagen, in response to fears that it might fall into Napoleon's hands, at the cost of starting a war with Denmark. Captain Hamilton left the ship, and was superseded by Captain Edward Sneyd Clay. Temeraire now became the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Manley Dixon, with orders to go to the Baltic to reinforce the fleet stationed there under Sir James Saumarez. Temeraire arrived in May 1809 and was sent to blockade Karlskrona on the Swedish coast. While on patrol with the 64-gun and the frigate , Temeraire became involved in one of the heaviest Danish gunboat attacks of the war. A party of men from Ardent had been landed on the island of Roms√∏, but were taken by surprise in a Danish night attack, which saw most of the Ardent men captured. The Melpomene was sent under a flag of truce to negotiate for their release, but on returning from this mission, was becalmed. A flotilla of thirty Danish gunboats then launched an attack, taking advantage of the stranded Melpomenes inability to bring her broadside to bear on them. Melpomene signalled for help to the Temeraire, which immediately dispatched boats to her assistance. They engaged and then drove off the Danish ships, and then helped the Melpomene to safety. She had been heavily damaged and suffered casualties of five killed and twenty-nine wounded. Temeraires later Baltic service involved being dispatched to observe the Russian fleet at Reval, during which time she made a survey of the island of Nargen. After substantial blockading and convoy escort work, Temeraire was ordered back to Britain as winter arrived, and she arrived in Plymouth in November 1809. Iberian service After a period under repair in Plymouth, Temeraire was recommissioned under the command of Captain Edwin H. Chamberlayne in late January 1810. The Peninsular War had reached a critical stage, with the Spanish government besieged in Cadiz by the French. Temeraire, now the flagship of Rear Admiral Francis Pickmore, was ordered to reinforce the city's water defences, and provided men from her sailor and marine complement to crew batteries and gunboats. Men from Temeraire were heavily involved in the fighting until July 1810, when Pickmore was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean and take up a new position as port admiral at Mah√≥n. Temeraire was thereafter based either at Mah√≥n or off Toulon with the blockading British fleet under Admiral Sir Edward Pellew. Chamberlayne was replaced by Captain Joseph Spear in March 1811, and for the most part the blockade was uneventful. Though possessing a powerful fleet, the French commander avoided any contact with the blockading force and stayed in port, or else made very short voyages, returning to the harbour when the British appeared. Temeraires one brush with the French during this period came on 13 August 1811. Having received orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hy√®res Bay. As he tried to do so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. Her boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, Temeraire was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Pellew ordered her back to Britain, and health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic. Retirement Temeraire arrived in Plymouth on 9 February 1812 and was docked for a survey several weeks later. The survey reported that she was \\"a well built and strong ship but apparently much decay'd\\". Spear was superseded on 4 March by Captain Samuel Hood Linzee, but Linzee's command was short-lived. Temeraire left the dock on 13 March and was paid off one week later. Advances in naval technology had developed more powerful and strongly built warships, and though still comparatively new, Temeraire was no longer considered desirable for front-line service. While laid up the decision was taken to convert her into a prison ship to alleviate overcrowding caused by large influxes of French prisoners from the Peninsular War campaigns. Conversion work was carried out at Plymouth between November and December 1813, after which she was laid up in the River Tamar as a prison hulk. From 1814 she was under the nominal command of Lieutenant John Wharton. Despite being laid up and disarmed Temeraire and the rest of her class were nominally re-rated as 104-gun first rates in February 1817. Temeraires service as a prison ship lasted until 1819, at which point she was selected for conversion to a receiving ship. She was extensively refitted at Plymouth between September 1819 and June 1820 at a cost of ¬£27,733, and then sailed to Sheerness Dockyard. As a receiving ship she served as a temporary berth for new naval recruits until they received a posting to a ship. She fulfilled this role for eight years, until becoming a victualling depot in 1829. Her final role was as a guard ship at Sheerness, under the title \\"Guardship of the Ordinary and Captain-Superintendent's ship of the Fleet Reserve in the Medway\\". This final post as flagship of the Medway Reserve involved her being repainted and rearmed, and she was used to train boys belonging to The Marine Society. For the last two years of her service, from 1836 to 1838 she was under the nominal command of Captain Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, in his post as Captain-Superintendent of Sheerness. Kennedy had been Temeraires first-lieutenant at Trafalgar. Sale and disposal Kennedy received orders from the Admiralty in June 1838 to have Temeraire valued in preparation for her sale out of the service. She fired her guns for the last time on 28 June in celebration of the Coronation of Queen Victoria, and work began on dismantling her on 4 July. Kennedy delegated this task to Captain Sir John Hill, commander of . Her masts, stores and guns were all removed and her crew paid off, before Temeraire was put up for sale with twelve other ships. She was sold by Dutch auction on 16 August 1838 to John Beatson, a shipbreaker based at Rotherhithe for ¬£5,530. Beatson was then faced with the task of transporting the ship 55 miles from Sheerness to Rotherhithe, the largest ship to have attempted this voyage. To accomplish this he hired two steam tugs from the Thames Steam Towing Company and employed a Rotherhithe pilot named William Scott and twenty five men to sail her up the Thames, at a cost of ¬£58. Last voyage Temeraire laid up at Beatson's Yard, Rotherhithe, by artist J. J. Williams, 1838‚Äì39 The tugs took the hulk of Temeraire in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking advantage of the beginning of the slack water. They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the ebb of the tide, where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at Rotherhithe at 2 pm. This was a breakers yard owned by the Beatson family.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p. 214 Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder pintles and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture. Legacy The immediate legacy of Temeraire was the use of the timber taken from her as she was broken up. A gong stand made from Temeraire timber was a wedding present to the future King George V on the occasion of his marriage to Mary of Teck, and is held at Balmoral Castle. A barometer, gavel, and some miscellaneous timber are in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, and chairs made from Temeraire oak are in the possession of the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth, Lloyd's Register, London and the Whanganui Regional Museum, Whanganui. An altar, communion rail and two bishop's chairs survive in St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. A ship model of Temeraire made by prisoners of war uses a stand made from wood taken from her, and is currently in the Watermen's Hall in London. Other relics of Temeraire known to exist or have existed are a tea caddy made for her signal midshipman at Trafalgar, James Eaton, and sold at auction in 2000, the frame for an oil painting by Sir Edwin Landseer titled Neptune, and a mantelpiece made for Beatson's office, supported by figures of Atlas supposedly taken from Temeraires stern gallery. The mantelpiece can no longer be traced, nor can a plaque once fixed to Temeraires deck commemorating Nelson's signal at Trafalgar, nor a wooden leg made for a Trafalgar veteran from Temeraires wood. John Ruskin foreshadowed the fate of Temeraires wood in an essay which claimed that \\"Perhaps, where the low gate opens to some cottage garden, the tired traveller may ask, idly, why the moss grows so green on its rugged wood, and even the sailor's child may not answer nor know that the night dew lies deep in the war rents of the wood of the old Temeraire.\\" Art Temeraire features in a number of paintings and prints, the earliest commemorating her role in the battle of Trafalgar. She can be seen at least partially in paintings of the battle by Clarkson Frederick Stanfield, John Christian Schetky, Nicholas Pocock, Thomas Buttersworth and Thomas Whitcombe. A fictionalized depiction of her launch was produced by Philip Burgoyne. Later representations of the retired Temeraire were also popular. Though no known contemporary image of her in the prison ship role exists, she was painted while a guardship on the Medway in 1833 by Edward William Cooke, and by William Beatson and J. J. Williams while laid up at Rotherhithe in 1838. More recently she has been the subject of paintings by Geoff Hunt. The most famous painting of Temeraire was made by J. M. W. Turner and titled The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838. Turner depicts Temeraire on her last voyage, towed up the Thames by a small black steam tug as the sun sets (or dawns). In choosing his title Turner created an enduring appellation, as previously she had been known to her crew as the \\"saucy\\" Temeraire. Turner presented it for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1839 with an accompanying excerpt, slightly altered, of Thomas Campbell's poem Ye Mariners of England. > The flag which braved the battle and the breeze, > no longer owns her. Turner's painting achieved widespread critical acclaim, and accolades from the likes of John Ruskin and William Makepeace Thackeray. It was Turner's particular favourite; he lent it only once and refused to ever do so again. He also refused to sell it at any price, and on his death bequeathed it to the nation. It hangs today in the National Gallery, and in 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Books The Fighting Temeraire is a historical narrative written by Sam Willis and details the \\"extraordinary story of the mighty Temeraire, the ship behind J. M. W. Turner's iconic painting\\". It includes a detailed history of the ship, history of both the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì63) and the Napoleonic Wars (1798‚Äì1815), and 50 full-color illustrations and 60 black-and-white photographs. The Temeraire series is a historical fantasy/alternate history written by Naomi Novik. While HMS Temeraire herself is only briefly featured, the ship becomes the namesake of the series' main character, a large black dragon who sees naval and aerial action alongside his British captain. The series takes place in an alternate version of the Napoleonic Wars, in which the various nations of the world fight with air forces made up of manned dragons. HMS Temeraire appears briefly in the ninth and final book. Poetry and songs Temeraire became the subject of a number of poems and songs commemorating her life and fate. An early work by James Duff written between 1813 and 1819 referenced her role as a prison ship, and was set to music in 1857 under the title The Brave Old Temeraire. More generally, an anonymous poem entitled The Wooden Walls of Old England appeared in Fraser's Magazine shortly after Temeraires arrival at Rotherhithe, and lamented the fate of the great sailing warships. Turner's painting created an enduring interest in the story of Temeraire and several poems appeared in the decades following her breaking up. Gerald Massey wrote The Fighting Temeraire Tugged to Her Last Berth, Herman Melville produced The Temeraire, and Henry Newbolt wrote The Fighting Temeraire, with its closing lines > Now the sunset's breezes shiver, > And she's fading down the river, > But in England's song forever, > She's the Fighting Temeraire. Notes a. Sometimes referred to as the Dreadnought class. b. This Temeraire retained her French name after her capture, and served during the Seven Years' War, before being sold out of the service in 1784. c. A number of general histories, including Goodwin's The Ships of Trafalgar and Noel Mostert's The Line on the Wind, say all 14 were hanged. Willis studied contemporary records and reports of the court-martial for his The Fighting Temeraire, and says only 12 of the 14 were sentenced to be hanged. Roy and Lesley Adkins offer a third account: twenty mutineers were tried, all were found guilty and eighteen were sentenced to death, and the other two were to receive one hundred and twenty lashes each. They note that at least six were hanged and possibly as many as twelve, the remainder may have had their sentences commuted to transportation. d. Lucas described the scene on Redoutable: > In less than half an hour our ship had been so fearfully mauled that she > looked like little more than a heap of debris.

The fall of the mainmast onto Temeraire also caused three French obusiers to fall onto her decks. Harvey promptly claimed them as souvenirs, \\"with which ... to commemorate the event every year in May by firing them off from the mound at Chigwell\\".Eliab Harvey (6 December 1805). Letter to W. Lloyd. Essex Record Office: D/DGu/C8. as cited in Willis. The Fighting Temeraire. p. 192. f. The identity of these tugs has been difficult to determine. Winfield names only one tug, Monarch. Goodwin names them as London and Samson, while Willis states they were Sampson and Newcastle.

Additional recording was done at Studio Plateau in Montreal and the album was engineered and produced by Al-P, with the exception of the Montreal sessions which were engineered by Drew Malamud. The album was released in October, 2004.\\"25 best Canadian debut albums ever\\". CBC Music, June 16, 2017. The band released three singles to promote, You're a Woman, I'm a Machine, these singles were \\"Romantic Rights\\" on November 4, 2004, \\"Blood on Our Hands\\" on February 17, 2005 and \\"Black History Month\\" on June 13, 2005. In 2005, the video for \\"Blood on Our Hands\\" won a VideoFACT award at the MuchMusic Video Awards. In 2004 the band changed their name to \\"Death from Above 1979\\" (previously named \\"Death from Above\\") due to a cease and desist letter that was filed against the band by James Murphy's label Death From Above Records. The band responded by attaching the legal minimum number of numerals required to keep the first part of the name. The band wrote a statement on their website: Murphy told his side of the story in a 2005 interview with Pitchfork, saying: As of August 3, 2006, the band officially disbanded. Keeler posted the following message on the official Death from Above 1979 forum: > I know its been forever since I wrote anything on here.

On MuchMusic's television program The New Music, Keeler further explained why the band split. He claimed it was due to disagreements with bandmate Grainger on many levels, including creative differences and musical style.  Reunion and The Physical World (2011‚Äì2016)  Sebastien Grainger performing at Parklife Festival 2011 On February 4, 2011, the band officially reunited. Grainger posted the following message on the band's website: The band performed a new song while performing at EdgeFest on July 14, 2012 at Downsview Park in Toronto. On September 18, 2012, a Canadian tour was announced; the band revealed that they had written new songs, but needed to perform them live in order to \\"make them any good\\". On October 28, 2012, the band's blog was updated as they built excitement for their string of shows around Canada. In the post, Grainger cited that they were \\"coming to share new material, and to work out the kinks\\". The band was originally scheduled to perform at Governors Ball Music Festival in June 2013, but later announced that they were having unexpected trouble while working on new music and cancelled their appearance. On July 11, 2013, the band confirmed that a new record is in the works on their Facebook page after cancelling European shows due to a \\"medical emergency\\". They did, however, perform at Wakestock Music Festival in August and Rifflandia in September. On July 8, 2014, the band released a single, \\"Trainwreck 1979\\", and announced more details of their upcoming studio album, The Physical World. On September 9, 2014 the band released their second album, The Physical World through Last Gang and Warner Bros. Records. On October 7, 2014 the band released a documentary Life After Death from Above 1979. The documentary chronicled the history of the band and their reunion. It was directed by Grainger's wife, Eva Michon. On April 22, 2016, the band released a live album, Live At Third Man Records which was recorded in 2015 at Jack White's Third Man Records headquarters in Nashville.  Outrage! Is Now (2017‚Äìpresent)  On June 6, 2017, the band announced an official name change back to the original \\"Death from Above\\". Although the band has said their social media handles will keep the \\"1979\\" suffix, all future music and shows from the duo will reportedly arrive under the new name. Grainger said in an interview that the band decided to not include the \\"1979\\" suffix on a tour promo for their tour with the Eagles of Death Metal in early 2016, \\"just to see what would happen\\" and the band received no legal issues because of it which led to them doing it again on their tour promo with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and once again there were no legal repercussions. Sebastian has also said the making the album art for the band's single \\"Freeze Me\\" also was part of the decision, \\"The final straw was when I was making the art for our single ‚ÄòFreeze Me‚Äô. I wanted to write the name out in ice, so I went on Amazon and ordered an ice cube tray in the alphabet. It came and there were no numbers. That was that.\\" Along with the name change, the duo announced the new single, \\"Freeze Me.\\" The song premiered on BBC Radio 1 before its release on June 7.  Musical style  Throughout its career, the band has been described as dance-punk, noise punk, and punk rock. Grainger has stated when the band first started he and Keeler's aim was \\"to be as straight ahead as possible,\\" and \\"to be the AC/DC of hardcore.\\" Rolling Stone claims \\"Death From Above embodied the DIY dance-punk aesthetic that lived in home recordings and grimy basement clubs\\" and that the band's early work \\"combined noisy hardcore, gritty synths and earnest screams\\".

The Society of American Business Editors and Writers, or SABEW, was formed in 1964 http://sabew.org/about/sabews-history/ to promote superior coverage of business and economic events and issues. Less than a half century ago the very idea that business news would ever emerge from behind the classified advertisement section would have been preposterous. But in the late 1950s, business news began to make the climb from obscurity. The movement began when the late R.K.T. (Kit) Larson, former associate editor of the Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star in Norfolk, Va., began talking with Charles C. Abbott of the University of Virginia about ‚Äúthe generally poor reporting of business news in the country‚Äôs press.‚Äù Larson organized several small seminars, and in 1961 put together a three-day session that attracted 60 business editors and writers. The success of that seminar resulted in another in 1963. A permanent organization took shape in 1964 when the Society of American Business Writers held its first meeting in New York City. Joseph Livingston served two terms as the first president of the organization in 1964 and 1965. In 1984, the Society took a major step by voting to place its offices at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. In 2009, the Board of Governors voted to move the Society's headquarters to Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication in downtown Phoenix, where it was established in September of that year. Today, its more than 3,400 members are from North America and several countries. In 1990, SABEW began offering institutional memberships, and now entire business staffs at major newspapers, business journals, business weeklies, wire services, online publications and broadcast outlets are members. As part of its educational mission, SABEW sponsors an annual convention and specialized reporting conferences. Since the mid-1990s, it has recognized the best in business and financial news coverage with the annual Best in Business Awards.http://sabew.org/best-in-business/ In 2014 SABEW formed a Canada chapter,http://sabew.org/canada/ which runs a separate Best in Business contest.

Some Ukrainian scholars, beginning in the 1930s, have interpreted the term 'ukraina' in the sense of 'region, principality, country'. In Ukrainian language (as well as Belarusian, but not Russian) the word for a country or a land is 'kraina'. The use of the word 'kraina' in Ukrainian language semantically is close to the meaning of partitioning than a border or an edge. Many medieval occurrences of the word can be interpreted as having that meaning. In this sense, the word can be associated with contemporary Ukrainian 'krajina' and Belarusian 'kraina', meaning 'country'.

With the Russian territorial expansion south and east into the lands of modern Sloboda Ukraine and mid Volga River the conflict intensified. Sometime between 1580s and 1640s the Belgorod Defense Line with number of fortifications, moats, and forts was constructed in Sloboda Ukraine, providing security to the region. After a number of Russo-Crimean Wars, the Russian monarchs started to encourage the settlement of the region by Cossacks who acted as a sort of frontier guard force against the raids of the Tatars. Folk architecture of Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine Apart from the Cossacks, the settlers included peasants and townspeople from Right and Left-bank Ukraine, divided by the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667. The name Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine derives from the word sloboda, a Slavic term meaning \\"freedom\\" (or \\"liberty)\\", and also the name of a type of settlement. The Tsar would free the settlers of a sloboda from the obligation of paying taxes and fees for a certain period of time, which proved very enticing for settlers. By the end of the 18th century, settlers occupied 523 slobodas (slobody) in Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine. From 1650 to 1765, the territory referred to as Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine became increasingly organized according to Cossack military custom, similar to that of the Zaporozhian Host and Don Host. The relocated cossacks became known as Sloboda Cossacks. There were five regimental districts (polky) of Sloboda Cossacks, named after the towns of their sustained deployment, and subdivided into company districts (sotni). Regional centers included Ostrogozhsk, Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, and Izyum, while the Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine Cossack capital was located in Sumy until 1743. Kharkov Viceroyalty in 1792 The administration of Catherine the Great disbanded the regiments of Slobozhanshchina and abolished Cossack privileges by the decree of July 28, 1765. The semiautonomous region became a province called Sloboda Ukraine Governorate (Slobidska Ukraine gubernia). St. Petersburg, 1901, First publication: 1865 Saint Petersburg replaced the regimental administrations with Russian hussar regiments, and granted Cossack higher ranks (starshinas) officership and nobility (dvoryanstvo). In 1780, the governorate was transformed into the Kharkov Viceroyalty (namestnichestvo) which existed until the end of 1796, when it was again renamed the Slobidska Ukraine gubernia. Each administrative reform involved territorial changes. In 1835 the province of Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine was abolished, ceding most of its territory to the new Kharkov Governorate, and some to Voronezh and Kursk, which came under the Little Russian General Governorship of Left-bank Ukraine. After the establishment of the Soviet Union Sloboda Ukraine was divided between the Ukrainian SSR and the Russian SFSR. The early 1930s forced end to Ukrainization in the parts of Sloboda Ukraine located in the Russian SFSR led to a massive decline of reported Ukrainians in these regions in the 1937 Soviet Census compared to the 1926 First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union.Unknown Eastern Ukraine, The Ukrainian Week (14 March 2012) The Ukrainian SSR reorganized their part of the region several times before establishing the borders of present-day Kharkiv Oblast in 1932.

Robertson was the first woman to defeat an incumbent congressman. She was known for her strong personality, commitment to Native American issues, and anti-feminist stance. Until the election of Mary Fallin in 2006, Robertson was the only woman elected from Oklahoma to Congress.  Education, teaching, and early public service  Robertson was born at the Tullahassee Mission in Creek Nation, Indian Territory, to missionaries Ann Eliza (n√©e Worcester) and William Schenck Robertson. Her maternal grandfather was Samuel Worcester, a long-time missionary to the Cherokees.

Her parents translated many works into the Creek language, including the Bible. In early life, Mary Alice Robertson was self-taught under the supervision of her parents. She attended Elmira College, in Elmira, New York. Career Robertson started working as a clerk in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Washington, D.C. (1873 to 1879). She returned to the Indian Territory and taught briefly in the school at Tullahassee. Later she taught at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, from 1880 to 1882. It was the model for Indian boarding schools across the country. Robertson returned to the Indian Territory, and established the Nuyaka Mission. It was run by Presbyterians who reported to the Creek Council. She taught in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, where she had charge of a Presbyterian boarding school for Native American girls. It eventually developed into Henry Kendall College and then the University of Tulsa. Robertson was appointed by the BIA as the first government supervisor of Creek Indian schools, and she served from 1900 to 1905. She was next appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt as the United States postmaster of Muskogee, Oklahoma, serving from 1905 to 1913. She was the country's first woman postmaster of a Class A post office. During World War I, she provided a canteen service to local troops in what was the start of the Muskogee Chapter of the American Red Cross.  Representative  Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Robertson became more involved in politics. She was elected by the 2nd District of Oklahoma as a Republican Representative to the 67th Congress, defeating the incumbent William Hastings. She was the first woman to defeat an incumbent representative in a general election. She served from March 4, 1921, to March 3, 1923, but was unsuccessful in running for reelection in 1922 and was defeated by Hastings. Robertson was the second woman to hold a seat in Congress, after Representative Jeannette Rankin from Montana, who served from 1917 to 1919. Before the expiration of her term, Rebecca Felton was appointed for one day to the Senate, and representatives Winnifred Huck from Illinois and Mae Nolan from California both won special elections; they were the third, fourth, and fifth women to serve in Congress. During her term, Robertson became the first woman to preside over the House of Representatives, on July 20, 1921. Robertson was the first woman elected to Congress after passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing women the right to vote. She opposed feminist groups such as the League of Women Voters and the National Women's Party. Robertson voted against bills funding maternity and childcare on the grounds that they were an unwarranted governmental intrusion on personal rights. This earned her the support of the Daughters of the American Revolution, of which she was a member. She also voted against the Dyer Anti- Lynching Bill  Later life  Robertson was appointed by President Warren G. Harding as a welfare worker at Veterans Hospital Number 90 at Muskogee in May 1923. She retired to run a dairy farm. Robertson died in Muskogee, and was interred in Greenhill Cemetery.

The province covers slightly more than the western two-thirds of the island. The western coast is characterized by steep slopes which plunge directly into the sea, indented occasionally by small bays leading to short deep valleys leading to the interior.Handy Geography The northern coast is indented by the four good-sized bays, Haka Ehu, Haka Ea (also called Haka Pua), Aa Kapa, and Haume. The southern coast is, like the western coast, characterized by steep slopes, and even cliffs, that plunge into the sea. These are broken by a succession of bays, the deep bay of Haka Ui in the southwest, with its neighboring bay Ua Uka, and near the center of the southern coast, Haa o Tupa, just west of the deep bay of Tai o Hae, location of the island's chief town, of the same name. To the east of Tai o Hae is a peninsula on the east side of which are the two small valleys of Haka Puu Vae and Haka Paa. On either side of the entrance to Tai o Hae, are small rocky islands, called \\"the sentinels\\", named Motu Nui on the west side, and Mata Ua Puna on the east side of the entrance to the bay. The interior of Te Ii is a high plateau, called T≈çvii, which is covered primarily by a tall-grass grassland. The highest peak on Nuku Hiva Tekao is along the northwestern edge of this plateau, reaching a height of 1,224 m (4,016 ft.). History Te Ii was formerly inhabited by a number of warring tribes, who were united only in times of war with the tribes of Tai Pi, the province covering the remainder of the island. There is some anecdotal evidence that indicates that the tribes of Ua Pou were sometimes united with the tribes of Te Ii in war against Tai Pi. Despite the fact that tribes from both the eastern and western halves of Ua Pu were often united in war against each other, however, it appears that such differences among them were not considered when members of tribes from either side of the island sought refuge among the tribes of Te Ii on Nuku Hiva.Handy Nuku Hiva Campaign The American fleet at Nuka Hiva in 1813. During the wars between the Te Ii and the Tai Pi in 1813, the American navy Captain David Porter arrived with the frigate and ten other armed ships on October 25. A shore party was landed and they claimed the island for the United States and constructed a small village, named Madisonville. A fort and a dock was also built, the latter to refit the Essex. Almost immediately Porter became involved in the tribal conflict. The first expedition into the jungle was led by Lieutenant John Downes, He and forty others captured a fort held by 3,000 to 4,000 Happah warriors with the assistance of several hundred Te Iis. The victory forced the Happah to terms and they allied themselves with both the Americans and the Te Ii. A second expedition was led by Porter himself and he made an amphibious assault against the Tai Pi held coastline. 5,000 Te Iis and Happahs accompanied the fleet in at least 200 war-canoes. Though the landing was unappossed, Porter's force of thirty men and a cannon led the march inland where they found another, more formidable, enemy fort. Thousands of natives armed with rocks and spears, positioned in a formidable mountain fortress, were able to fend off their enemies. The victory was short-lived however and Captain Porter followed up his landing with an expedition overland, bypassing the fort, to threaten the Tai Pis village center in Typee Valley as the Americans named it.http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex- in-the-south-pacific.htm When the column arrived at their destination it was November 30 of 1813. The first shots fired occurred after the Tai Pis attempted to ambush the column, the attack was beaten off and the Porter issued a messing warning that if the Tai Pi did not cease their resistance at once, he would destroy the villages. After a little while of waiting, the hostiles seemed to ignore the demands so the expedition advanced. An engagement ensued as the villages were burned. In the end, the Americans and their Te Ii and Happah allies had won at severe cost to the enemy, who sued for peace soon after. The next few months were peaceful until May 1814. The War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom was in its third year most of the American fleet was captured British privateers. At least six British prisoners were at Nuku Hiva during the American operations against the natives, not including a number who volunteered to fight for Captain Porter. But in December 1813, Porter left Nuka Hiva to continue raiding British whalers. He left behind only nineteen navy sailors and six prisoners under two midshipmen and United States Marine Corps Lieutenant John M. Gamble. On May 7, 1814, a group of the British sailors mutinied, released the six prisoners and attacked the fort. Gamble was wounded in the foot and taken captive with his remaining men on the corvette Seringapatam though the Americans were set adrift later that day.http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david- porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htm An Englishman, named Wilson, on the island was used as an interpreter by Porter and on May 9 he convinced the Te Ii that Porter would not return which the natives were not happy about. Wilson eventually persuaded the Te Iis to cancel the alliance and attack. Six American sailors were on the beach at Madisonville when the Te Iis attacked, Four of the men were killed and one other man escaped wounded with a second survivor. Gamble was alone on the Sir Andrew Hammond, one of the captured British ships. While still recovering from his wound to the foot, two Te Ii war-canoes attacked the ship. The ship's cannon were already loaded so Lieutenant Gamble stumbled from one gun to another, firing them as fast as he could. Ultimately Gamble beat off the enemy attack single-handedly though after the deaths of four of his men in town, there was no choice but to abandon the colony with the remaining seven, all of whom were either wounded or ill. After that the base was never again occupied by American forces. Captain Porter, who intended to sail back to Nuka Hiva, was captured at the Battle of Valparaiso on March 28.http://www.historynet.com/war- of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htmBoot, pg. 31-37 References * * Category:Nuku Hiva ","title":"Te I ªi"},{"id":"1508075","text":"The Alagnak River is a tributary of the Kvichak River in the U.S. state of Alaska. It has a catchment area of approximately 1400 square mi (3600 km2). It is located in central Lake and Peninsula Borough. Names According to the National Park Service, in the local language the word Alagnak means \\"making mistakes\\". The river course is dynamic, changing often and splitting into new branches. For this reason, it is known locally as the \\"Branch River\\", where boaters may mistake one branch for another. On the other hand, Native American Placenames of the United States says that the river's name may come from the Yupik word alagnaq, a kind of red berry. The United States Geological Survey says something similar, citing Richard H. Geoghegan, a philologist, who said the native word referred to a wild raspberry. Course It begins as the outflow of Kukaklek Lake in Katmai National Park and Preserve and meets the sea at Bristol Bay. The beginning of the river lies in the Aleutian Range. The first six miles of the river run slowly through the tundra. Vegetation along the upper part of the river consists mostly of spruce. Afterwards, the valley becomes much narrower with near-vertical rock faces. Miles 7‚Äì14 run through a narrow canyon at around 7.5 mph. The Nonvianuk River runs into the Alagnak at around mile 20. To the west, the river meanders over the Alaska Peninsula before flowing into the Kvichak River, which itself flows into Bristol Bay. Flora and fauna Due to the large numbers of salmon, there is a significant bear population in the summer and fall, including both grizzly and black bears. The majority of the catchment area is a winter habitat for Alaskan caribou. Moose are also to be found during the entire year. Along the river, beaver, foxes, wolverines, mink, and otter are all found as well occasional wolf. In the water, there are several varieties of salmon, including sockeye salmon, pink salmon, chum salmon, king salmon, and silver salmon. There are also rainbow trout, char, Arctic grayling, and northern pike. Along the river there is also eclectic vegetation including spruces, willows and various types of berries. History=Early history The first humans to arrive at the Alagnak were apparently 14000 years ago, during the glacial retreat of the last ice age. The earliest documented records of humans settling there were 9000 years ago; stone tools dating from this time have been found in middens at abandoned camps near the river. Microblades known as atlatl were used from about 7000 years ago to hunt caribou by natives. The first known all-year winter villages weren't constructed until about 2300 years ago; house development and town size to contend with climate change occurred rapidly at around this time. Pottery dating from 2500 years ago has also been found. The first white humans arrived in the 19th century, with the first white man to document the river being the Russian captain Tebenkov in 1852. At the same time, native peoples began leaving the area, with the Alagnak River village being abandoned around 1860. In 1900 the North Alaska Salmon Company built two canneries at the junction of Alagnak and Kvichak rivers. The cannery at the river mouth became known as Lockanok and the other cannery, 1000 feet upstream on the Kvichak River, was called Hallerville, in honor of J.P. Haller, president of the company. The two canneries were connected by a narrow gauge railroad that brought salmon from Hallerville to be processed at the Lockanok plant. The abundance of salmon in the rivers made this fishery one of the most prolific in Alaska. People from as far away as the Yukon River area came to get jobs at the canneries, and before long cash income allowed subsistence users to buy food store items such as coffee, tea, sugar and salt. The 1912 eruption of Mount Katmai nearby only mildly devastated the region and the Yu'pik Indians continued to keep food caches at the site. Growing importance In 1916 Libby, McNeill & Libby purchased both the Lockanok and Hallerville canneries from the North Alaska Salmon Company. Growing erosion around the Kvichak River banks made canning more difficult by the 1920s, and the cannery was closed in 1936 and burned down during a 1937 fire. Any remaining planks of wood from the building were taken to houses along the river and helped to create new homes for the natives. In 1918 the Spanish flu epidemic broke out and ravaged the villages throughout June 1919, killing 39 natives and creating 16 new orphans. Despite the tragedy, villages along the river prospered due to jobs offered by the cannery. After the decimation of natives by the disease, white human settlement around the Alagnak increased rapidly. In June 1927 Russell Merrill of Anchorage Air Transport flew to the canneries at the river junction, making it the first plane to land at Bristol Bay. At the same time, big game hunting and fishing became popular at the site, and from 1937 onwards, big game hunting charters regularly flew trips to the site. When the site's rainbow trout streams were discovered, the find was a feature in the April 1941 article of Field and Stream magazine. Jay Hammond, who would later become the 4th governor of Alaska, was one of the major fishing charters in the area, first flying to it in 1946 and meeting with friend Bill Hammersley, who first came there in 1940. Beginning in 1938‚Äì47, prospectors and beaver trappers began to regularly visit the site, as it was rich in gold abundance and beavers, whose fur was to become one of the most important pelts in Alaska until the collapse of the fur trade. One of the most prized big game mammals in the area was the Alaska Peninsula brown bear, which led many big game hunters in the wilderness to seek fame and fortune. Hunting and fishing lodges were established about 1957. By 1973, a galley-scow that was towed up the Alagnak from Naknek had been established. Protected area When nearby Katmai National Monument was established in 1921, conservationists began to consider creating a protected area around Alagnak as well. Hunters and fisherman spoke out against this, believing it would deprive them of hunting and fishing opportunities. As the legislation for Katmai National Park did not allow any hunting and fishing, the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act established Alagnak Wild River to allow protection of wilderness but legal, limited sport and subsistence hunting and trapping, along with fishing. Most hunters come to Alagnak to hunt for moose to eat and grizzly bear to bag as trophies. Wild River In 1980, a total of on the upper Alagnak and one of its tributaries, the Nonvianuk River, were designated \\"wild\\" as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The tributary, which drains Nonvianuk Lake, is long. Tourism The Alagnak is one of the most important rivers for sport fishing in Alaska. The river is navigable for canoeists. In the ravine, there are rapids from levels 1 to 3. This section of the river is dangerous for inexperienced rafters, especially during highwater. Portage is possible but difficult.

It is the administrative centre for the Shire of Hinchinbrook. Geography Ingham is approximately north of Townsville and north of the state capital, Brisbane. The town is positioned about 17 km inland within the Herbert River floodplain where Palm Creek drains the low-lying lands. It is surrounded by sugar cane farms which are serviced by a number of private railways. The North Coast railway line passes through the town, which is served by the Ingham railway station. The Bruce Highway also passes through the town. History Architectural plans for Ingham Gaol Prior to European settlement, the Ingham area was inhabited by the Warakamai People. Warrgamay (also known as Waragamai, Wargamay, Wargamaygan, Biyay, and Warakamai) is an Australian Aboriginal language in North Queensland. The language region includes the Herbert River area, Ingham, Hawkins Creek, Long Pocket, Herbert Vale, Niagara Vale, Yamanic Creek, Herbert Gorge, Cardwell, Hinchinbrook Island and the adjacent mainland. The town was founded in 1864. It was gazetted as the local government area Hinchinbrook Division in 1879, becoming the Shire of Hinchinbrook in 1903. The town is named after William Bairstow Ingham, a pioneer sugar planter on the Herbert River in 1874. Lower Herbert Post Office opened on 1 January 1871 and was renamed Ingham in 1882. A gaol opened in July 1886; previously there had only been a police lock-up. The town has a strong Italian and Spanish history with the 1920s and 1930s seeing a large influx of immigrants from these countries. The Black Hand Gang, made up of some of these immigrants, terrorised the town in the 1930s with bribery and corruption, forming a dark chapter in the town's history. Ingham State High School opened on 2 February 1952. Ingham State School opened on 4 May 1855 and celebrated its Golden Jubilee in December 1935. Hinchinbrook Shire Library The current Hinchinbrook Shire Library opened in 2011 in Ingham. In March 2018, flood waters inundated properties in Ingham following heavy rain. Population According to the of Population, there were 4,357 people in Ingham. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.6% of the population. * 81.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was Italy at 5.0%. * 82.5% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian at 7.2% * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 45.8%, Anglican 15.5%, No Religion 13.1%.  Industry  Ingham is the service centre for many sugarcane plantations, which are serviced by the two sugar mills located in the Ingham district: Victoria Sugar Mill (located approximately 6 km from Ingham), which is the largest sugar mill in Australia and one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, and Macknade Mill, which is the oldest operating sugar mill in Queensland. Both mills are owned and operated by Wilmar Sugar Australia Limited. The majority of the cane is transported to the mills by light tramlines.The Tramways of the Ingham District Verhoeven, G Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, June 1971 pp122-131 Once processed by the mills, the raw sugar is then transported by tramline to the bulk sugar terminal at the nearby seaside port of Lucinda and loaded onto ships for export via the longest pier in the southern hemisphere (4.75 km long). Other industries in the Ingham area include cattle, watermelons, rice, horticulture, fishing, timber and tourism. Attractions The town is home to the regional art gallery called TYTO Regional Art Gallery which sits alongside the Tyto Wetlands and Enrico's Restaurant. In the same precinct is the Hinchinbrook Shire Library located at 73-75 McIllwraith Street. Wallaman Falls are about 40 km to the west of the town. Hinchinbrook Island is about 20 km north of Ingham.  Australian-Italian Festival  The Australian-Italian Festival is held in Ingham the first weekend in August each year and is one of the most popular events in the region, with thousands of people attending the event. The festival celebrates Ingham's cultural background, dating from the 1890s, when the first Italian immigrants came to the region. More than half the population of the town are of Italian descent.Australian Italian Festival Ingham . Retrieved on 17 May 2012. The town is known as \\"Little Italy\\". The annual festival, held at Tyto Wetlands, began as an idea from a community workshop. Many Italians visit from Italy to celebrate the event, reinforcing the cultural ties between the inhabitants of Ingham and Italy.

Located on Dean Street west of Franklin Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, it was serviced by the Franklin Avenue Shuttle. The Dean Street station had the unusual distinction of being opened and closed twice in its history (along with the South Ferry loop station), though the line it served continues in operation.  History  The Kings County Elevated Railway was connected to the Brighton Beach Line in 1896 by means of a ramp and short elevated line from a point south of the latter railroad's terminal at Atlantic and Franklin Avenues in Brooklyn. The local property owners were promised a station on the elevated structure near the old Bedford Terminal, and one was established by 1897 at Dean Street, nearly adjacent to the former terminal, which was closed. The station was not well patronized and the elevated company closed it c. 1899.According to a 1901 report, the Brighton Beach Railroad had applied for abandonment of the Dean Street station: * An uproar ensued, including appeals to the State Railroad Commission. By November 1899, one John Costello of Brooklyn had filed a complaint with the New York State Board of Railroad Commissioners. On October 28, 1901, Dean Street was opened for the second time. The station continued to be poorly patronized, as it was only a few hundred feet from the Franklin Avenue station, which was located at the busy intersection of Fulton Street and Franklin Avenue. Nevertheless, Dean Street was upgraded to handle six-car subway trains with the rest of the Franklin Avenue Line in 1924. However, through the 1970s and 1980s, the Dean Street station deteriorated with other stations on the line. In 1985, the station had only 133 paying daily riders (i.e., not counting farebeaters) on a typical weekday, making it one of the least used stations in the system. In 1995, the New York City Transit Authority closed the station permanently as part of service cuts. The TA cited low patronage (the lowest on the subway system), its decrepit condition, and its proximity to Franklin Avenue station. At the time of its closing, Dean Street and Franklin Avenue were the two closest stations on the system, located just three blocks from each other at their closest points. It was charged that many who used Dean Street station jumped over the turnstiles, a major problem at the time, lowering the passenger count even further. Remnants The line that once served the Dean Street station, the BMT Franklin Avenue Line, still operates as the Franklin Avenue Shuttle. The elevated portion of the line was completely rebuilt in the late 1990s, reopening in 1999. Nothing visible remains of the former station, except for an oddly placed lamppost at street level. (The lamppost on the right is shorter than the one on the left, and was used to illuminate a former stairway to the station.)

Hans Biebow during his trial in 1947. Hans Biebow (December 18, 1902 ‚Äì June 23, 1947) was the chief of German Nazi administration of the Lodz Ghetto in occupied Poland. Biebow's early life is summarized by the following curriculum vitae which he submitted to the German Ghetto Administration () on 10 May 1940. After working as a coffee importer in his hometown of Bremen, Biebow became the overseer of the Litzmannstadt Ghetto. He realized that the Litzmannstadt Ghetto could make a profit for the Germans if it were converted into essentially a slave labor complex. Under his administration, the 164,000 Jews of Poland's second largest city were crammed into a small area of the city. Communication between the Ghetto inhabitants and the outside world was completely cut off and the supply of food was severely limited, ensuring that many of the inhabitants of the Ghetto would slowly starve. Over the course of its existence, the population of the Ghetto swelled to 204,000 with more Jews from Central Europe being sent there. The Ghetto Administration remained in operation from April 1940 until the summer of 1944, but there were transports out of the Ghetto to German extermination camps (primarily Auschwitz and Chelmno). He was directly responsible for starving the ghetto's population beyond limits of endurance, and he assisted the Gestapo in rounding up Jews during deportations. In the days just before the liberation of Lodz by the Red Army, Biebow ordered large burial pits to be dug in the local cemetery, intending that the Gestapo execute the remaining 877 Jews who served as a clean-up crew in the ghetto. This might have been an attempt by Biebow to eliminate witnesses to his role in the workings of the Ghetto. Biebow exercised his control in part through a Jewish administration headed by Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski. Rumkowski believed that the Jews could survive if they produced cheap, essential goods for the Nazis. Biebow profited substantially from the sale of the products of Jewish labour as well as from the seized properties of Jews. He is also said to have provided less food to Ghetto inhabitants than was paid for, pocketing the difference. The Ghetto factories produced products such as boots for German soldiers and were profitable for the Germans because the Jews, cut off from all resources, worked for wages that consisted only of bread, soup, and other essentials. The German profits from the Jewish factories have been estimated at $14,000,000 and the productivity of the Ghetto was a factor in its comparatively long survival. The inhabitants endured four years of starvation, illness and overcrowding before being sent to the extermination camps of Che≈Çmno and Auschwitz. Of the 204,000 inhabitants, approximately 104,000 survived.Exhibition Ghetto Litzmannstadt,1999‚àí2000. Among the Nazi hierarchy, Biebow was an early exponent of using the Jews as cheap labor rather than killing them, but he readily adapted to the extermination policy. Survivors report his encouraging the last surviving Jews of the Ghetto in the summer of 1944 to board the trains to Auschwitz with a speech that began \\"My Jews...‚Äù and promised them work in the West. Biebow was able to escape into hiding in Germany in 1945 after the unconditional surrender, but was recognized by a survivor of the ghetto and subsequently arrested in Bremen. After he was extradited by the Allies to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, he stood trial from April 23 to April 30, 1947. He was found guilty on all counts and executed by hanging on June 23, 1947.

Later she became the first wife of actor Jacob Adler, with whom she relocated to London in 1883, after Yiddish theater was banned in Russia. A Jew, born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1859, she came from a genteel family, descended from Jews from the Courland (now Latvia). Jacob Adler, in his memoir, remarks that at the time he met her, she was a student at the University of Odessa, who, like him, spoke Yiddish and Russian, but also spoke much better German than he, and also excellent French. He adds that \\"like all the best young people of the day\\" she was a nihilist, a \\"serious young student and revolutionary\\", and that her (and her family's) passion for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the profession through the difficult early years of his career as an actor. Her debut as a professional actress (Odessa, 1878) was in the title role of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, in the troupe of Israel Rosenberg, the first Yiddish theater troupe in Imperial Russia; at first she played opposite Jacob Spivakovsky, but she pulled strings so that Jacob Adler, to whom she was already close at the time, would get the role. The next few years of theatrical touring had their ups and downs; initially, so did her relationship with Adler, but they married in Poltava in 1880. For greater detail on this troupe and its travels, see Israel Rosenberg. The February 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II was calamitous for the Jews of Russia, for Yiddish theater, and for the Adlers. At that time, the Adlers were in Goldfaden's troupe, and had been expecting soon to play in Saint Petersburg. The mourning for the tsar meant there would be no performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time-- to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where Jacob and the pregnant Sonya had to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, their fortunes soon proved even worse: provocateurs were traveling around the empire, stirring up pogroms, one of which soon swept through Nezhin. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm by partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden. Adler, 1999, 172, 179-189, 192-197 After a few more months of continuing to perform in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Zhytomyr, Sonya returned to her parents' house in Odessa to give birth to her daughter Rivkah (Rebecca), who later died in London at the age of 3. Adler, 1999, 197, 216 Sonya, too, died in London, from an infection contracted while giving birth to her second child, Abram (\\"Abe\\") Adler, in 1886 at age 27.

Depictions of personifications of the four continents became popular in several media. Sets of four could be placed around all sorts of four-sided objects, or in pairs along the facade of a building with a central doorway. They were common subjects for prints, and later small porcelain figures. A set of loose conventions quickly arose as to the iconography of the figures. They were normally female, with Europe queenly and grandly dressed, Asia fully dressed but in an exotic style, with Africa and America at most half-dressed, and given exotic props as attributes.Hall, 129 A three- cornered world The ancient tripartite view of the observed known world Before the discovery of the New World a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the \\"three parts\\" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa.

Europa: woodcut in Ripa's Iconologia 1603 A fourth corner: the enlarged world For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at \\"our sea\\", the Mediterranean; Europeans were only dimly aware of the Ural Mountains, which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or cratons. Instead, the division between these continents in the European- centered picture was the Hellespont, which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the Age of Discovery, Asia began beyond the Hellespont with Asia Minor, where the Roman province of Asia had lain, and stretched away to what were initially unimaginably exotic and distant places-- \\"the Orient\\". Iconography Africa: woodcut in Ripa's Iconologia 1603 In 1593, Cesare Ripa published one of the most successful emblem books for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times, though the text did not always correlate to the illustration. The book was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. Ripa's text and the many sets of illustrations by various artists for different later editions (beginning in 1603) took some of the existing iconological conventions for the four continents, and were so influential that depictions for the next two centuries were largely determined by them. Ripa's Europe (illustration, left) is depicted as a woman dressed in fine clothes. She wears a crown while the papal tiara and crowns of kings lie at her feet, indicating her position of power over all the continents. The plentiful cornucopia shows Europe to be a land of abundance and the small temple she holds signifies Christianity. As a continent of great military force, Europe is also accompanied by a horse and an array of weapons. This probably draws on the Europa regina map schematic. Africa, by contrast (illustration, right) wears the elephant headdress and is accompanied by animals common to Africa such as a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands, and Cleopatra's asps. These depictions come straight from Roman coins with personifications of the Roman province of Africa,As coin of Hadrian, 136 AD, described as: \\"Africa, wearing elephant‚Äôs skin headdress, reclining left, holding scorpion and cornucopia, modius at her feet\\". a much smaller strip of the Mediterranean coast. The abundance and fertility of Africa is symbolized in the cornucopia that she holds. Other personifications of Africa at the time depict her nude, symbolizing the Eurocentric perceptions of Africa as an uncivilized land. While the illustration of Africa in Ripa‚Äôs Iconologia is light-skinned, it was also common to illustrate her with dark skin. Asia: woodcut in Ripa's Iconologia 1603 Asia (illustration, right), seen by Europe as a continent of exotic spices, silk, and the seat of Religion, wears rich clothing and carries a smoking censer. The continent‚Äôs warm climate is represented by the wreath of flowers in her hair. A camel takes its ease beside her.America, woodcut in Ripa's Iconologia 1603 And the iconic image of America (illustration, below left) shows a Native American maiden in a feathered headdress, with bow and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled Amazon from the river that already carried the name. In other instances of American iconography, symbols meant to connote wilderness and a tropical climate occasionally included animals entirely absent from the Americas, such as the lion. Flora and fauna as images were often interchangeable between depictions of Africa and America during the seventeenth century due to the association of the tropical climate of Central and South America with that of Africa. In addition to having an untamed landscape, America was portrayed as a place of savagery by virtue of the people who inhabited it. This can be seen in the woodcut as America is depicted as much more warlike than the other three continents. As Claire Le Corbeiller explains, America ‚Äúwas usually envisioned as a rather fierce savage ‚Äì only slightly removed in type from the medieval tradition of the wild man.\\" The woodcut also shows America stepping on a human head, which is meant to connote cannibalism. Evidence of dismemberment, such as disembodied heads, in addition to America‚Äôs bow and arrows and her lack of clothing were all meant to connote savagery. Such imagery was not uncommon in depictions of the Americas, but it was not always the case. In time, the image of a wild native being justly subjugated by a European conqueror was turned into a portrayal of an ‚ÄúIndian princess‚Äù. The American millionaire philanthropist James Hazen Hyde, who inherited a majority share in Equitable Life Assurance Society, formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the New-York Historical Society; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various New York City museums. The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents; Europe is represented by the Danube, Africa and Asia by the Nile and the Ganges respectively, and America is represented by the La Plata. The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, a 17th-century fountain in Rome designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the Piazza Navona in Rome, and in the painting The Four Continents by Peter Paul Rubens. Fountain of the Four Rivers, (Danube, Nile, Ganges, La Plata) With the confirmed discovery that Australia was an island continent, the theme of the \\"Four Continents\\" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, Antarctica, was discovered. The iconography survived as the Four Corners of the World, however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the Beaux-Arts Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House (1907), four sculptural groups by Daniel Chester French symbolize the \\"Four Corners of the World\\".

These tasks often entail the embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the arrangements for the funeral ceremony (although not the directing and conducting of the funeral itself unless clergy are not present). Funeral directors may at times be asked to perform tasks such as dressing (in garments usually suitable for daily wear), casketing (placing the corpse in the coffin), and cossetting (applying any sort of cosmetic or substance to the best viewable areas of the corpse for the purpose of enhancing its appearance). A funeral director may work at a funeral home or be an independent employee. Etymology The term mortician is derived from the Roman word mort- (‚Äúdeath‚Äù) + -ician. In 1895, the trade magazine The Embalmers' Monthly put out a call for a new name for the profession to distance itself from the title undertaker, a term that was then perceived to have been tarnished by its association with death. The term Mortician was the winning entry. History As the societal need to account for the dead and their survivors is as ancient as civilization itself, death care is among the world's oldest professions. Ancient Egypt is a probable pioneer in supporting full-time morticians; intentional mummification began 2600 BC, with the best- preserved mummies dating to 1570 to 1075 BC. Specialized priests spent 70 full days on a single corpse. Only royalty, nobility and wealthy commoners could afford the service, considered an essential part of accessing eternal life. Across successive cultures, religion remained a prime motive for securing a body against decay and/or arranging burial in a planned manner; some considered the fate of departed souls to be fixed and unchangeable (e.g., ancient Mesopotamia) and considered care for a grave to be more important than the actual burial. In ancient Rome, wealthy individuals trusted family to care for their corpse, but funeral rites would feature professional mourners: most often actresses who would announce the presence of the funeral procession by wailing loudly. Other paid actors would don the masks of ancestors and recreate their personalities, dramatizing the exploits of their departed scion. These purely ceremonial undertakers of the day nonetheless had great religious and societal impact; a larger number of actors indicated greater power and wealth for the deceased and their family. Modern ideas about proper preservation of the dead for the benefit of the living arose in the European Age of Enlightenment. Dutch scientist Frederik Ruysch's work attracted the attention of royalty and legitimized postmortem anatomy. Most importantly, Ruysch developed injected substances and waxes that could penetrate the smallest vessels of the body and seal them against decay. Historically, from ancient Egypt to Greece and Rome to the early United States, women typically did all of the preparation of dead bodies. They were called \\"Layers out of the dead\\". Mid nineteenth century, gender roles within funeral service in the United States began to change. Late nineteenth century it became a male dominated industry with the development of Funeral Directors, which changed the funeral industry both locally and nationally. Role in the United States As recently as 2003 15 per cent of corporately owned funeral homes are owned by one of three corporations. The majority of morticians work in small, independent family-run funeral homes. The owner usually hires two or three other morticians to help them. Often, this hired help is in the family, perpetuating the family's ownership. Other firms that were family-owned have been acquired and are operated by large corporations such as Service Corporation International, though such homes usually trade under their pre- acquisition names. Most funeral homes have one or more viewing rooms, a preparation room for embalming, a chapel, and a casket selection room. They usually have a hearse for transportation of bodies, a flower car, and limousines. They also normally sell caskets and urns.\\"Funeral Directors.\\" Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-07 Edition. 4 Aug, 2006. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. 8 Dec, 2008.

This does not include embalming or cremation of the body until further training is completed.  Organizations and licensing in the UK  In the UK no formal licence is required to become an undertaker (funeral director). There are national organizations such as the British Institute of Funeral Directors (BIFD), the National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) and the Society of Allied and Independent Funeral directors (SAIF) The BIFD offers a licence to funeral directors who have obtained a diploma-level qualification - these diplomas are offered by both the BIFD and NAFD. All of the national organizations offer voluntary membership of \\"best practice\\" standards schemes, which includes regular premises inspection and adherence to a specific 'code of conduct' These organizations help funeral directors demonstrate that they are committed to continual personal development and they have no issue with regulation should it become a legal requirement [13].https://nafd.org.uk/https://www.bifd.org.uk/https://saif.org.uk/  Role in Canada  The role of a funeral director in Canada can include embalming, sales, oversight of funeral services as well as other aspects of needed funeral services.  Organizations and licensing in Canada  A funeral director in Canada will assume many responsibilities after proper education and licensing. Courses will include science and biology, ethics, and practical techniques of embalming. There are a number of organizations available to Canadian funeral directors.

He was first known just as Te Wherowhero and took the name P≈çtatau after he became king in 1858. As disputes over land grew more severe Te Wherowhero found himself increasingly at odds with the Government and its policies. Early life Te Wherowhero was the eldest son of Te Rau-angaanga, who belonged to the senior chiefly line of NgƒÅti Mahuta and was a prominent war leader before and during the 1807‚Äì1845 Musket Wars. When Te Wherowhero was born near the end of the 18th century his father had just become the principal war chief of the Waikato tribes. Te Rau-angaanga defeated a much larger coastal Tainui and Taranaki force of about 7,000 warriors led by NgƒÅti Toa chief Pikauterangi in the battle of Hingakaka near Ohaupo. Te Wherowhero's mother, Te Parengaope, was a daughter of a chief of NgƒÅti Koura, a hap≈´ (subtribe) of Waikato. Te Wherowhero was thus descended from the captains of both the Tainui and Te Arawa waka (canoes), which are said to have brought the MƒÅori to New Zealand. Te Wherowhero grew up in a period of relative peace for the Waikato tribes, following his father's victory over NgƒÅti Toa in the battle of Hingakaka. He was taught traditional lore, first by his father and then at Te Papa-o-Rotu, the Waikato whare wananga (school of knowledge) at Whatawhata. He lived at Kaitotehe pƒÅ on the western bank of the Waikato River, at the base of the HƒÅkarimata Range and opposite Taupiri on the other bank. He had four wives, Whakaawi, Raharaha, Waiata and Ngawaero. His children included Matutaera TƒÅwhiao, Te Paea Tiaho, Makareta Te Otaota and Tiria (these last two may be the same person). When his fellow NgƒÅti Mahuta chief and relative Te Uira killed a NgƒÅti Toa man, and was in return killed by a war party led by NgƒÅti Toa chief Te Rauparaha, Te Wherowhero joined his father in attacks on NgƒÅti Toa at KƒÅwhia. When Marore, a wife of Te Rauparaha, was visiting relatives in Waikato for a tangihanga in about 1820, Te Wherowhero instigated her murder by Te Rangi-moe-waka. After a series of revenge killings, Te Wherowhero led 3,000 Waikato and NgƒÅti Maniapoto warriors on an overland attack on KƒÅwhia, while 1,500 of their allies from Whaingaroa (Raglan) attacked by a sea route. Together they defeated NgƒÅti Toa at Te Kakara, near Lake Taharoa, and Waikawau, south of Tirua Point. Te Rauparaha and NgƒÅti Toa were then besieged at Te Arawi, near KƒÅwhia Harbour. Some of the Waikato and Maniapoto besiegers did not want to see NgƒÅti Toa exterminated, so they were permitted to give up their territory at KƒÅwhia and migrate to northern Taranaki. Te Wherowhero led a large army to Taranaki, partly to pursue NgƒÅti Toa and partly to rescue Peehi Tukorehu, a NgƒÅti Maniapoto chief, whose war party was besieged by Taranaki tribes at Pukerangiora, on the Waitara River. Although never forced to retreat, he incurred large costs in human life in sieges which were sometimes unsuccessful. Early in 1822 the Waikato forces suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of NgƒÅti Toa and their allies at Motunui in north Taranaki. Te Wherowhero was almost killed when he refused to retreat and abandon the body of a slain Waikato chief. The intervention of Te Rauparaha saved him, but subsequently he had to engage a number of enemy chiefs in single combat, armed with only a digging implement. Eventually his own people returned and a negotiated truce ensued. Te Wherowhero returned to the Waikato that year in time to take command in an unsuccessful defence of his tribe at Matakitaki (Pirongia) against NgƒÅpuhi, armed with muskets and led by Hongi Hika on their great rampage through the North Island of 1818 to 1823. The Waikato people settled further south than their usual territory for several years, in fear of further attacks by NgƒÅpuhi. Te Wherowhero lived at Orongokoekoea on the upper Mokau River, where his wife Whakaawi gave birth to their son TƒÅwhiao. Peace was made with NgƒÅpuhi in 1823 and the Waikato re- established themselves on their tribal land. By the time NgƒÅpuhi re-appeared in the area some ten years later the Waikato had also acquired muskets and could therefore defend themselves successfully. In 1831 Te Wherowhero led an immense war party against the Taranaki Maoris and killed many hundreds of the Ngatiawa tribe, whose lands more than ten years later he claimed by right of conquest. By 1836 Te Wherowhero made peace with the Taranaki tribes. This occurred at a time when missionaries were having a greater impact upon iwi in the Waikato. Te Wherowhero himself regularly attended services, but was never baptised. Waikato's (or more specifically NgƒÅti Maniapoto's) involvement in the Taranaki war against the Government forces in the 1860s can be traced back to Te Wherowhero's long series of attacks against the Taranaki iwi Te ƒÄti Awa. Te Wherowhero at one stage claimed Te ƒÄti Awa were slaves who lived there only on his sufferance, but he was prepared to end all interest in the land when he was paid 250 pounds. Keenan argues that Te Wherowhero never occupied Te ƒÄti Awa's land long enough to constitute possession according to MƒÅori customary lore. Nor did Te ƒÄti Awa ever entirely abandon their land thereby maintaining their occupation rights. During the latter stages of the war in Taranaki it was the involvement of Waikato warriors in bringing food and war materials (lead and powder) that enabled the Taranaki warriors to keep fighting in the infertile, wet and inhospitable uplands. Treaty and influence with Grey In March 1840 Te Wherowhero was living at Awhitu in the western Manukau. Captain William Symonds brought a copy of the Treaty of Waitangi to Manukau for chiefs to sign, but Te Wherowhero refused. However he was friendly towards the colonial government and not opposed to PƒÅkehƒÅ presence in areas he controlled. Initially Te Wherowhero favoured the PƒÅkehƒÅ arrivals in his territory: his daughter, Tiria, married the trader John Kent. In May 1844 Te Wherowhero hosted a large intertribal gathering at Remuera, near Auckland, with the view mainly of impressing Governor Robert FitzRoy with the power of the Northern Maoris. He was subsequently received at Government House, Auckland, and treated with great distinction by Fitzroy. Te Wherowhero built a house at Pukekawa (in today's Auckland Domain) and it witnessed many discussions and negotiations concerning the implementation of the Treaty. The Waikato tribes sold land initially; Te Wherowhero sold some tribal land around Manukau. However in 1846 he protested vehemently to Queen Victoria about an edict that land not actually occupied or cultivated by MƒÅori was to be considered Crown property. Between 1847 and 1852 Governor Grey arranged for 861 retired British soldiers called fencibles and their families to establish a number of military villages at Howick, Panmure, Otahuhu and Onehunga. In April 1849 Te Wherowhero signed an agreement with Governor George Grey to provide Auckland with military protection on the same basis as the fencibles. 121 Ngati Mahuta -originally from Tamahere, now on the southern outskirts of Hamilton, had British officers but supplied their own weapons. The land they were given by Grey was 80 one acre lots and 80 five acre lots at Mangere. Other chiefs who made the agreement were Kati, Nopora, Kahawai, Ponku,Te Tauke, Rewaite, Hankapanga,Te Katea and Rameka Kiaki (sic). They could be called upon for defence should it become necessary after the violent uprising of MƒÅori under H≈çne Heke and Kawiti. Grey had learnt the importance of having the support of k≈´papa, MƒÅori who sided with the Crown, during that campaign to restore law and order and assert government authority. During the 1851 attack on Auckland by about 350-450 Ngati Paoa a British regiment, the Onehunga fencibles and HMS Fry defended Auckland at Mechanics Bay with Ngati Mahuta playing no part.The Royal New Zealand Fencibles 1847‚Äì1852 .R Alexander. G Gibson. A. LaRoche. Deed . Waiuku. 1997.p108 Although he never ceded sovereignty to the British Crown, he did have good rapport with early New Zealand governors, especially George Grey. As more settlers came to New Zealand, from the early 1850s Te Wherowhero became less friendly to the PƒÅkehƒÅ. This was at least partially due to the nature of these arrivals in the Waikato lands, who often encroached on MƒÅori tribal lands with no formal jurisdiction or consensual purchasing or gifting of the land. MƒÅori King The flag hoisted at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia on the proclamation of P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero as MƒÅori King, drawn 1863. In the early 1850s, a movement to establish a MƒÅori King developed. This aimed to unite the MƒÅori people and to act as a counterbalance to Queen Victoria. But above all the King Movement wanted to halt the sale and alienation of MƒÅori land by the PƒÅkehƒÅ Government. Matene Te Whiwhi travelled throughout New Zealand seeking a chief of high standing who was willing to be king. Iwikau Te Heuheu Tukino III, of Ngati Tuwharetoa, suggested that Te Wherowhero should be approached, and his choice was supported by Wiremu Tamihana, of Ngati Haua. P≈çtatau, then elderly, expressed initial reluctance, but agreed in April 1857 at Rangiriri. He was installed as king at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia in June 1858. P≈çtatau himself wished to continue to work in co-operation with the British Government, but many of his followers adopted a much more independent position. Gradually the two sides polarised and grew apart, culminating five years later in warfare (see Invasion of the Waikato and New Zealand Wars). Death P≈çtatau died at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia on 25 June 1860 and is buried on Mount Taupiri, a mountain close to his royal residence in NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. His son, Matutaera Tawhiao, succeeded him.

It has an area of 15 km2. Much of the island's sparse vegetation has been destroyed by feral goats and sheep, to the extent that following its rare rains, the sea around it is stained red from runoff. Early reports describes the island as fertile, with forest and fields. When Thor Heyerdahl visited the island in 1938, there were only a few goats and remains of deserted huts and villages. Mohotani is administratively part of the commune (municipality) of Hiva-Oa, itself in the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas Islands. It is reported that at one time the island was inhabited by a clan called the ‚ÄúMoi a Tiu‚Äù, but that population has long since been wiped out by disease and war, the few survivors having departed for Hiva  ªOa. In pre-European times, the island was considered part of the territory of the province of Pepane. In 1992, the island and its surrounding smaller islands (including Terihi) were officially protected by the declaration of the Motane Nature Reserve.

Although Motu One was reportedly visited by Marquesans, primarily on egg-collecting missions, there is no archaeological evidence that they were ever inhabited. The first Westerners to sight the islet were on the 1813-1814 voyage of the American commander Commodore David Porter, who named it Lincoln Island. Subsequent explorers also called it Sand Island. Ecology Green sea turtles nest on Motu One. There is a large stand of Porolithon (Hydrolithon) that is unique in French Polynesia. There are a wide variety of pelagic birds nesting on the islets including a subspecies of the southern Marquesan reed warbler, the Mohotani Marquesan warbler (Acrocephalus mendanae consobrina) (Murphy & Mathews, 1928).Marquesan Reed-warbler (Acrocephalus mendanae) Since 1992, the whole reef and island ecosystem have been protected as the Motu One Reserve.

Located 23 km west of Dublin, in Maynooth, County Kildare, the Carton Demesne is 1,100 acres (4.5 km¬≤). For two hundred years, the Carton Demesne was the finest example in Ireland of a Georgian-created parkland landscape. In the 2000s, much of the demesne was redeveloped into two golf courses and the house into a hotel complex. History=Beginning of the Carton Demesne During a history spanning more than eight centuries, Carton Demesne has seen many changes. The estate first came into the ownership of the FitzGerald family shortly after Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan (c. 1105-1176), a Cambro- Norman noble, played an active role in the capture of Dublin by the Normans in 1170 and was rewarded by being appointed Lord of Maynooth, an area covering townlands which include Carton. His son, Gerald FitzMaurice (c. 1150-1204), became jure uxoris 1st Baron of Offaly, and his descendant John, 4th Baron of Offaly (c. 1250-1316), became The 1st Earl of Kildare in 1315. Under The 8th Earl of Kildare (c. 1456 - c. 1513), a long-serving Lord Deputy of Ireland, the FitzGerald family reached pre-eminence as the virtual rulers of the Lordship of Ireland between 1477 and 1513. The Lordship of Ireland was replaced by the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542. However, the 8th Earl's grandson, The 10th Earl of Kildare (1513-1537), better known to history as 'Silken Thomas', was executed at Tyburn in February 1537, with his five uncles, for leading an uprising against the English Crown. 'Silken Thomas', previously styled as Lord Offaly, had succeeded to the earldom in December 1534. Although the FitzGeralds subsequently regained their land and titles, they did not fully regain their position at either the Irish or British Courts until the 18th century, when The 19th Earl of Kildare (1675-1743) became a noted statesman. First house at Carton The first record of a house at Carton was in the early seventeenth-century when William Talbot, Recorder of Dublin, was given a lease of the lands by The 14th Earl of Kildare (d. February 1612) and is thought to have built a house. The house and lands were forfeited to the Crown in 1691 and in 1703 sold to Major-General Richard Ingoldsby, Master General of the Ordnance. Commencement of the current house In 1739, the lease was sold back to The 19th Earl of Kildare, who employed Richard Cassels (1690-1751) to design the existing house. This was the same year the FitzGerald family bought Frescati House. Castle (originally Cassels) was also responsible for some other grand Irish houses, including: Castle Hume, on the shores of Lower Lough Erne in County Fermanagh; Summerhill House in County Meath; Westport House in County Mayo; Powerscourt House in County Wicklow; and, in 1745, Kildare House (later renamed Leinster House) in Dublin, which he also built for the FitzGeralds. In 1747, The 20th Earl of Kildare (created His Grace The 1st Duke of Leinster in 1766) married Lady Emily Lennox, daughter of The 2nd Duke of Richmond and great‚Äìgranddaughter of King Charles II. Lady Emily played an important role in the development of the house and estate as it is today. She created the Chinese Room (bedroom to Queen Victoria) and decorated the famous Shell Cottage on the demesne with shells from around the world. One of Emily's 23 children was the famous Irish patriot Lord Edward FitzGerald, a leader of the 1798 rebellion. 19th century Carton remained unaltered until 1815, when His Grace The 3rd Duke of Leinster (1791-1874) decided to sell Leinster House to the Dublin Society (renamed the Royal Dublin Society in 1820) and make Carton his principal residence. He employed Richard Morrison to enlarge and re-model the house. Morrison replaced the curved colonnades with straight connecting links to obtain additional rooms, including the famous Dining Room. At this time, the entrance to the house was moved to the north side. Twentieth- and twenty-first century history Carton remained in the control of the FitzGeralds until the early twentieth- century when His Grace The 7th Duke of Leinster (1892-1976) sold his life interest to a moneylender, Sir Harry Mallaby-Deeley, to pay off gambling debts of ¬£67,500. The 7th Duke, who was known as Lord Edward FitzGerald up until he inherited the dukedom in February 1922, was originally third in line to succeed, so he did not think he would ever inherit. However, both of his older brothers were unmarried and predeceased him. His eldest brother was His Grace The 6th Duke of Leinster (1887-1922), who had succeeded as a child to the dukedom and estates in December 1893 but who suffered from serious psychiatric issues; the 6th Duke lived from 1907 until his death in February 1922 in a house in the grounds of Craig House Psychiatric Hospital in Edinburgh. Lord Edward's other older brother was Major Lord Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1916), an officer in the Irish Guards who was accidentally killed during a grenade demonstration at Calais during the First World War. So, Lord Edward inherited the dukedom and what remained of the Carton Estate in February 1922, thus becoming the 7th Duke. In this way, much of the Carton Estate was lost to the FitzGerald dynasty. Carton House and what remained of the Carton Estate was finally sold by The 7th Duke of Leinster and his son, the then Marquess of Kildare (1914-2004), in the late 1940s. It is alleged that, in 1923, a local unit of the IRA went to Carton with the intention of burning it down. However, they were stopped when a member of the FitzGerald family brought a large painting of Lord Edward FitzGerald to the door and pointed out that they would be burning the house of a revered Irish patriot. During the Second World War, Carton House was occupied by the Irish Army who used the building as the headquarters of the 2nd Infantry Division.https://www.flickr.com/photos/militaryarchives/9151972234/in/photostream/ In 1949 the house was purchased by The 2nd Baron Brocket (1904‚Äì1967), a multi- millionaire Tory peer and businessman and a member, by descent, of the ancient Ulster family of √ì Cath√°in (O'Cahan or O'Kane),Montague-Smith, P.W. (ed.), Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage, Kelly's Directories Ltd, Kingston-upon-Thames, 1968, p.178 whose principal residence was Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, England. Lord Brocket bequeathed Carton to his younger son, The Hon. David Nall-Cain, who having moved to the Isle of Man, sold the house in 1977http://www.cartonhouse.com/files/hotel/downloads/historic_leaflet_v4.pdf to the Mallaghan family. In 2017 the Mallaghan family sold Carton House to John Mullen for ‚Ç¨57 Million. Government decision not to buy the estate From 1977 to 2017, Carton House and Demesne was the property of the Mallaghan family, and in the 1980s and 1990s the Irish Government came under public and political pressure to buy the house and its grounds but decided not to do so. House as film set The house was used as a film location by many film- makers and broadcasters. Two of the films made there were Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon in 1975 and The Big Red One in 1980. They starred Ryan O'Neal (as an 18th-century Irish adventurer, with a soundtrack by The Chieftains) and Lee Marvin respectively. The film Leap Year, starring Amy Adams, Matthew Goode, and Adam Scott, shot some scenes at Carton during 2009.http://atriptoireland.com/2012/02/29/leap-year-where-was-it-filmed/ Director Blake Edwards and wife actress, Julie Andrews, lived in Carton House over the summer and autumn of 1969 while filming the movie Darling Lili (1970). Rock Hudson, Andrews costar also lived on the grounds during filming. The actual house was used in the movie in several interior and exterior scenes. More recently, Carton House was used as a prime location for the filming of the Irish drama Love/Hate. Conversion into a hotel with golf courses In 2000, Carton was redeveloped as a \\"premier golf resort and hotel\\", an action condemned by heritage groups, including An Taisce, and criticised in Seanad √âireann (the Irish Senate) by Senator David Norris. A hotel was added to the main house, altering it drastically, while the estate's eighteenth-century grounds were converted into two golf courses. Tyrconnell Tower, Carton Estate.

Carton House was the venue for the European Tour's Nissan Irish Open in 2005 and 2006, having previously hosted the 2004 and 2005 AIB Amateur Open Championship. In 2006, Carton House was the first Irish golf club to be awarded the 'Committed to Green' environmental award by the International Committed to Green Foundation, and the International Association of Golf Tour Operators, European Golf Resort of the Year 2008. The 2013 Irish Open was held on the Montgomerie Course at Carton House (27‚Äì30 June). The winner was England's Paul Casey with an outstanding ‚àí5 (67) on the final day including an eagle on the last for a total of ‚àí14 to win by 3. =Golfing Union of Ireland= The Golfing Union of Ireland, the longest established golf union in the world, have their national headquarters on the Carton House Demesne.

Partners in a music store and repair shop, their repairs and customizations gained the attention of Los Angeles studio musicians and jazz guitarists such as Lee Ritenour, Steve Lukather, Tommy Tedesco and Larry Carlton. They began building custom guitars from scratch in 1977, and by 1983 demand for these guitars had increased to the point of requiring a separate manufacturing facility. Most of their guitars had a radical styling similar to that of a superstrat; others were modified versions of Fender's popular designs, the Stratocaster and the Telecaster. \\"Signature\\" Valley Arts features often included highly figured wood grain on the front, translucent colored finishes, gold hardware, Floyd Rose locking tremolos, EMG and Seymour Duncan humbucking pickups. In late 1990 the store was destroyed by fire. Underinsured, McGuire and Carness found it necessary to sell the store and concentrate on the manufacturing side of the business. In an attempt to expand their business, in 1992 they sold half of Valley Arts to the Korean guitar manufacturer Samick. One year after, Samick bought the whole company. McGuire and Carness became dissatisfied with their positions in the company and the quality of the guitars manufactured by Samick, and by 1993 they had moved to positions at Gibson. Through the 1990s Gibson was moving to expand and diversify its brands, and by the late 1990s they had decided to acquire the \\"Valley Arts\\" name as an outgrowth of the Gibson Custom Shop.

Its name is a reference to Dolphin, the GameCube's codename during development. The WaveBird was available for purchase separately as well as in bundles with either Metroid Prime or Mario Party 4, which were exclusive to Kmart in the US. Development Nintendo had attempted to create a reliable wireless controller since the development of the Famicom. Its first attempt was for the Advanced Video System (AVS), the precursor to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), which included two wireless controllers but was never released. Nintendo later developed an infrared (IR) adapter called the NES Satellite for the NES. Released in 1989, it used infrared to extend the length of up to four wired controllers, which would plug into the base of the unit rather than the console. The base could then be positioned anywhere within a certain range of the NES without the need for a cable. However, the extension base still needed a direct line of sight with the NES console; line of sight is a significant limitation of IR technology, requiring a clear space between an IR port and controller. Radio Frequency controllers were not possible in the late 1980s as the early digital RF links were bulky and used too much power to be useful in battery-powered devices. However, advancements in integrated circuits made radio controllers for game consoles commercially viable only a decade later. The WaveBird, released in 2002, solved previous usability problems of wireless controllers by relying on radio frequency communication instead of infrared, allowing the controller to be used anywhere within 6 meters (20 ft) of the console. Although Nintendo only certifies the WaveBird to work within this 6 meter (20 ft) range, tests have proven that they may work as far as 27.5 meters (90 ft) on all 16 different channels. Design The WaveBird Wireless Controller is designed and sold by Nintendo. Unlike most wireless controllers of its era, it relies on RF technology (first used in gaming with Atari's CX-42 joysticks) instead of infrared line-of-sight signal transmission, and the controller's radio transceiver operates at 2.4 GHz. The range of the WaveBird controller is officially 6 meters (20 ft) but some users have reported ranges of 18-21 meters (60‚Äì70 ft). The WaveBird includes a small receiver unit which must be plugged into the controller port of the GameCube. Made of the same gray- colored plastic as the standard WaveBird, it features a channel-selection wheel and an LED to indicate when a signal is received. Up to sixteen WaveBird controllers may be used in the same area if each is set to a different channel. The WaveBird Wireless Controller maintains the same overall aesthetic design as the standard GameCube controller. The components (analog sticks, buttons, and triggers) and layout remain the same, while adding wireless functionality and space for two standard AA batteries. It is somewhat larger and heavier than a standard GameCube controller, with a channel selector dial, an on/off switch, and an orange LED power indicator on the face of the controller in place of the gap between the D-pad and the C-stick. Functionally, the only feature the WaveBird controller lacks compared to the standard controller is the rumble feature, the motors of which would reduce battery life. Available colors The WaveBird Wireless Controller was available in most regions only in light gray and platinum colors. In Japan, two limited edition WaveBird models were released through Club Nintendo: 1,000 Special Edition Gundam \\"Char's Customized Color\\" WaveBirds (two-toned red with the Neo-Zeon logo) to coincide with the Japan-only GameCube release of Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Z Gundam, and a \\"Club Nintendo\\" WaveBird (white top with light blue bottom and Club Nintendo logo).. Use on the Wii, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch Like all GameCube controllers, the WaveBird Wireless Controller is compatible with the Wii, for use with GameCube and Virtual Console titles as well as certain Wii games and WiiWare titles. Since the launch of the Wii, the WaveBird has seen increased popularity due to its ability to control these games wirelessly. Following speculation that Nintendo might re-release the WaveBird due to the popularity of its use on the Wii, a Nintendo representative confirmed that there were no plans to offer WaveBirds in stores again. Although the representative stated that \\"original GameCube controllers\\" would be available directly from Nintendo, there is no listing for the WaveBird. In November 2014, Nintendo released a GameCube controller adapter for use with the Wii U alongside the release of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. In 2018, shortly after the announcement of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch, the company added support for the Wii U GameCube controller adapter for the newer hybrid console.Owen S. Good, Oct 24, 2017, GameCube controller support comes to Nintendo Switch https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/24/16533932/nintendo-switch-gamecube- controllers Legal issues Anascape Ltd, a Texas-based firm, filed a lawsuit against Nintendo for patent infringements regarding Nintendo's controllers. A July 2008 verdict found that a ban would be issued preventing Nintendo from selling several controllers, including the WaveBird, in the United States. Nintendo was free to continue selling the WaveBird pending an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 13, 2010, Nintendo won the appeal and the previous court decision was reversed.

MULTI-S01 is an encryption scheme preserving both confidentiality and data integrity. The scheme defines a pair of algorithms; the encryption, the corresponding decryption with verification. Coupling with an efficient keystream generator, such as Panama, MUGI, and RC4, the algorithm efficiently encrypts a message in the manner of a single path process, i.e. online algorithm. The decryption function cannot be used in such manner for keeping whole resultant data until successful verification. The keysize of MULTI-S01 is determined by which keystream generator to use. MULTI-S01 takes a security parameter which determines the upperbound probability of successful forgery. Since the calculation consists of addition and multiplication over the finite field, the algorithm is more suited to hardware implementation, although software implementation is still feasible. MULTI-S01 with the PRNG Panama was among the cryptographic techniques recommended for Japanese government use by CRYPTREC in 2003, however, has been dropped to \\"candidate\\" by CRYPTREC revision in 2013. It has also been submitted to ISO/IEC 18033 Part 4 which defines stream- cipher standards. The security of MULTI-S01 is based on that of underlying PRNG.

Classical human rights, such as the right to life or freedom of expression, are formulated or understood as prohibitions for the State to act in a way that would violate these rights. Thus, they would imply an obligation for the State not to kill, or an obligation for the State not to impose press censorship. Modern or social rights, on the other hand, imply an obligation for the State to become active, such as to secure individuals' rights to education or employment by building schools and maintaining a healthy economy. Such social rights are generally more difficult to enforce. Positive obligations transpose the concept of State obligations to become active into the field of classical human rights. Thus, in order to secure an individual's right to family life, the State may not only be obliged to refrain from interference therein, but positively to facilitate for example family reunions or parents' access to their children. The most prominent field of application of positive obligations is Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Important cases have been taken to the ECHR in Strasbourg which over the last ten years has moved to making positive obligations especially in the field of transsexuals right to decide if they want surgery to convert their bodies as far as possible from one sex to the other. Cases such as Van Kuck v Germany 2003 made it positive obligation on EU states to provide sex change surgery and this was repeated in the L v Lithuania 2007 verdict and again in the Schlump v Switzerland 2009 verdict. Because of this the Swiss Government and many other removed the need for a person to prove they needed sex change surgery in 2010. However, there are still countries, especially the UK, which refuse to accept the legality of the positive obligations on them regardless of the fact that this makes them liable to being found guilty of Article 8 violations.

Its name is taken from the constellation Orion, as the newspaper is meant to be a \\"hunter of truth.\\"  History  The Orion's first issue was published March 12, 1975. The offices were in the basement of Meriam Library. The newspaper was eight pages long and in tabloid format. There was another student paper on campus, The Wildcat, which was funded by the Associated Students. Because of frequent conflicts, The Wildcat removed itself from the campus in 1977, leaving The Orion as Chico State's only student newspaper. Today, The Wildcat is known as the Chico News & Review. The Orion moved from the Meriam Library basement to the Plumas Hall basement in the mid-1980s. The Orion won its first National Newspaper Pacemaker Award in 1989.  Operation  The Orion is published every Wednesday of the semester, except for fall semester finals week. During finals week of spring semester, a special summer issue is produced. Each issue was broadsheet format until 2015 and changed to tabloid format. The paper is divided into news, opinion, calendar, arts and sports sections. The Orion has separate staffs for editorial content, business/advertising, and design. Editorial content (and the paper overall) is headed by the editor in chief and the managing editor, business and advertising is headed by the business manager, and design is headed by the art director. In editorial content, there are four specific departments, covering different types of events: news, opinion, sports and features. Each section is headed by an editor, who oversees a staff of reporters. Editors choose one of the reporters to be an assistant editor. There are also three more departments: copy proofreads and copy edits stories, photo produces picture to be included with the stories and online produces content in conjunction with the other departments for production on the newspaper's Web site. Design is divided into two departments: editorial and advertising. These departments are headed by a design manager. Editorial design helps layout and creates graphics for editorial content, while advertising design designs advertisements for the paper that are sold by the business staff. Advertising design is also assigned a member of the copy department who proofreads ads. The business department oversees the financial aspects of the paper, selling and placing advertisements, handling costs, and helping the paper stay in budget.

A technically correct left-handed batsman, Yallop invariably batted near the top of the order for Australia during a stop-start international career that began in 1975‚Äì76 against the West Indies. In 1978, Yallop made history as the first player to wear a full helmet in a Test match. He also enjoyed a long and successful career with his home state Victoria, leading them to two Sheffield Shield titles. Early career Yallop played for Richmond in the Dowling Shield in the late 1960s. He made his grade debut for the club in the summer of 1970‚Äì71. That summer he also played some games for the Victorian Schools Team (which also included Gary Cosier and Ray Bright) at the Australian Schoolboys Cricket Championships. He later reflected, \\"I thought the structure was pretty good, I thought it was excellent. When we were playing under-16 cricket in Victoria, you‚Äôre playing against the best under-16 players in the state. So that prepared you for your future in Premier Cricket, I thought that was a very good grounding.\\" His coach was former English player Frank Tyson who had emigrated to Australia. \\"He helped me enormously with bowling and batting,‚Äù Yallop said. ‚ÄúSo in those days, I was more a bowler than a batsman, and he turned me around. He worked with me for quite a few years to get me up to speed with my batting.‚Äù In early 1971 Yallop toured Sir Lanka in an Australian Schoolboys side that also included Ray Bright. Yallow had an excellent tour, averaging 67.75 runs an innings in the three schoolboy internationals, the best of any Australian batsman.Schools in Ceylon 1971/72 at CricketArchive 1972‚Äì73: First Class debut Yallop made his first class debut for Victoria in December 1972, making 55 and 21 against NSW, whose attack included five players who had or would play test cricket (Jeff Thomson, Gary Gilmour, John Gleeson, Doug Walters and John Watkins); Yallop's runs were crucial helping Victoria win by two wickets. His next first class game, also against NSW, saw him score only 15 and 5. Then there was 19 and 58 against Western Australia; Yallop's second fifty was the top score in Victoria's second innings, in a game WA won by three wickets. \\"A lot of the time I was 12th man, so that‚Äôs in the team but it‚Äôs not in the team,\\" he recalled. \\"Yes and no, you‚Äôre disappointed, but I knew I was young. Twenty years of age, you‚Äôre still learning the game. [‚Ä¶] You‚Äôve just got to get up there through results.\\" In 1973 Yallop played for Walsall in the Birmingham League. He also played some games for the Marylebone Cricket Club. 1974-75 Yallop did not play first class cricket during the 1973‚Äì74 season. However he was back in the Victorian side over the 1974‚Äì75 summer. He played in the Gillette Cup, scoring 2 then he made 32 and 48 against Western Australia (a low scoring game which Victoria won by 3 wickets), 34 and 30 against the touring English side (Tony Greig dismissed him twice), 21 and 0 against New South Wales, and 0 against Queensland. Yallop's season improved with score of 56 and 77 against New South Wales, 23 and 57 against South Australia, and 11 and 38 against WA before making his debut first class century (100 not out) against South Australia, whose attack included two test spinners, Terry Jenner and Ashley Mallett. Yallop ended the season with 5 and 4 against Queensland. He had made 538 first class runs that summer at 38.28. In 1975 Yallop played league cricket in England and scored more than 3,000 runs for North Birmingham Club.  1975‚Äì76 Test debut  Yallop begun the 1975‚Äì76 season slowly. He made 38 in a Gillette Cup game then failed against Queensland, made only 20 and 8 against the 1975‚Äì76 West Indians and 21 and 6 against WA. Things turned around with 79 and 62 against South Australia, his second innings easily the top score and bringing Victoria within 7 runs of victory. Then he made 108 and 95 against NSW. These scores earned him selection in the Australian side to play the West Indies in the fourth test at the SCG. He was picked to replace Rick McCosker who had made 20 runs in six innings. \\"Its a great thrill and I'm determined to make the most of my chance\\", said Yallop at the time. He also called it \\"the biggest surprise of my life... it never crossed my mind I was in the running.\\" Yallop later wrote in his (ghosted) memoirs that: > The dropping of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and his teammates and I copped > the brunt of it. I may have been an unassuming guy at the time, but I was > rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level ‚Äì thanks, or rather no > thanks to Chappell and the rest of the team. I was not exactly welcomed with > open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the > Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was > selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. > I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg > Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team > wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. > Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be > 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There > was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, > and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no > batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test > debut.Yallop p 16-17 Yallop made 16 and 16 not out in his debut, a game Australia comfortably won by 7 wickets. His next first game was a Sheffield Shield match against Queensland in which Yallop scored 17. Yallop was kept in the Australian side for the 5th test at Adelaide which proved a happier experience for him; he made 47 and 43, taking part in century partnerships in each innings (one with Ian Redpath the other with Alan Turner). Australia won the game by 190 runs. Rick McCosker returned to the side for the sixth test at the MCG, batting at number three, but Yallop kept his place ‚Äì batting down the order at number six he made 57 in the first innings and did not bat in the second, with Australia winning by 165 runs. Yallop had averaged 44 for three tests. He ended the summer with scores of 24 and 7 against NSW, and 77 and 13 against South Australia. He made 524 runs for Victoria at an average of 47.63, their best performing batsman. 1976‚Äì77 season Yallop had a strong chance to consolidate his spot in the Australian team in 1976‚Äì77, especially as Ian Redpath and Ian Chappell had retired. Chapell wrote at the start of the summer that he felt the batsman \\"had a head start\\" over his rivals \\"with a couple of steady Test performances last year, but he still has a lot of work ahead and will have to spread his run scoring around Australian grounds a little more consistently than in the past.\\" However Yallop started the summer slowly: he made 10 and 19 against Queensland, and 16 and 1 against NSW. Doug Walters was back from injury and took Yallop's spot in the Australian batting line up (Ian Davis was opener). Yallop's form did get better: 61 against South Australia, 100 against Tasmania 1 and 134 against WA 57 against South Australia, 67 against Queensland, and 6 against NSW. However, by the time Yallop regained form Kim Hughes had become the established batsman in \\"reserve\\" - it was Hughes who was selected on the 1977 tour of New Zealand. In January 1977 Ian Chappell selected a hypothetical Ashes tour squad for Cricketer magazine that excluded Yallop. Chappell wrote about the Victorian: > I don't feel he's made enough runs off the Melbourne ground to prove he has > the goods. I wasn't very impressed when he decided to pull out of Victoria's > game against WA in Perth this season. If I was Yallop, on the verge of the > test side being announced, I would have played even with a broken arm. And I > still maintain that Yallop was picked prematurely for Australia. At the end of the summer David Hookes and Craig Serjeant emerged as exciting propsects. The batsmen ultimately selected on the 1977 Ashes tour were Chappell, McCosker, Cosier, Walters, Hookes, Hughes and Serjeant. Yallop had scored 472 first class runs at 47.20. World Series Cricket=1977‚Äì78: Test recall Yallop's chances at resuming his test career increased during the 1977 when it was revealed that a large number of Australian players had signed to play World Series Cricket for Kerry Packer. Ian Chappell was in charge of selecting the World Series Cricket players and he overlooked Yallop in favour of Martin Kent, Bruce Laird and Rob Langer (Kim Hughes and Gary Cosier were also overlooked; Craig Serjeant was offered a WSC contract but turned it down). Bob Simpson came out of retirement to captain Australia over the 1977-78 summer. Many felt Yallop would be recalled to the national side: his three tests against the West Indies made him one of the more internationally experienced batsmen available for selection; India were touring, and Yallop was renowned as one of the country's best players of spin; in addition, he took over captaincy of the Victorian side from Richie Robinson, who had signed with WSC. However Yallop started the summer patchily, making 35 and 14 against Queensland, 61 and 9 against India, and 1 against Tasmania. He was overlooked for the first test in favour of Paul Hibbert, Gary Cosier, David Ogilvie, Craig Sergeant, Peter Toohey and Kim Hughes (who ultimately played as 12th man). Yallop made 105 and 114 against NSW but was not picked in the Australian side for the next three tests. Hibbert was dropped after only one test but was replaced by John Dyson, a specialist opener. Cosier missed a test through injury and was replaced by Hughes. Yallop made 35 and 48 against South Australia, 79 against NSW, 53 and 30 against WA. In one day games he made 9. After the fourth test the series stood at 2-2. The selectors decided to simultaneously announce a team for the 5th test and the squad to tour the West Indies. Ogilvie, Serjeant and Hughes were dropped from the test team and replaced by Graeme Wood, Rick Darling and Graham Yallop; Yallop was also appointed vice captain (Serjeant had previously performed that role). Yallop later recalled, \\"‚ÄúI would‚Äôve liked to have played earlier on in that tour against India, but again I made more runs towards Christmas rather than the start of the year, so consequently I didn‚Äôt get selected. And therefore, you have to wait your turn.‚Äù In the 5th test Yallop hit 121 in the first innings, his first Test century; he made 24 in the second, helping Australia win the match and the series. He made 729 first class runs that summer at 56.07. 1977‚Äì78 Tour of West indies Yallop's first game in the West Indies was against Leeward Islands, where he made 24 and 28. He only made 12 in the first one-day international but showed good form against Trinidad making 66 and 44 not out. Yallop played at number three in the first test making 2 and 81 (more than double the next top score in the innings); Australia lost by an innings. In the second test, at Bridgetown, Yallop scored 47 in the first innings but only 14 in the second, as Australia fell to another defeat. Yallop scored 118 in a tour game against Guyana in Georgetown but was retired hurt after a bouncer from Colin Croft fractured his jaw. This meant he missed the third test, which Australia ended up winning, in part because the West Indies decided not to pick their players who had signed with WSC. Yallop returned to the Australian side for the second ODI, making 7. In the fourth test he made 75 in the first innings, which was Australia's top score - he made 18 in the second, again Australia's top score, as the batting collapsed and the West Indies won. Yallop's good form with the bat continued with 5 and 58 in a tour game against Jamaica. In the last test he scored 57 and 23 not out. Yallop's series total was 317 test runs at 45.29, one of Australia's best performers on tour. Australian Captain: \\"A lamb to the slaughter\\" =1978-79 vs England At the beginning of the 1978‚Äì79 series, Australian Cricket Board (ACB) decided that the veteran incumbent Bobby Simpson could not be guaranteed the captaincy for the season. Simpson decided to retire and Australia needed a new captain against the visiting English side. Yallop was considered a front-runner due to his batting success in the West Indies and captaincy experience with Victoria. Yallop began the season poorly against Qld, making 6 and 12 and made only 10 for Victoria against England. However he made 115 against WA. Yallop was selected as captain for Australia's first test, the side also including Wood, Cosier, Peter Toohey, Kim Hughes, Tom Laughlin, John MacLean, Rodney Hogg, Jim Higgs, Alan Hurst, Bruce Yardley. Yallop had more captaincy experience than the other batsman, though not as much as MacLean (who would be playing in his first test and was appointed vice-captain). According to Christian Ryan, \\"Most observers suspected John Inverarity, wily and versatile, would have been a more astute choice\\" than Yallop. \\"So it proved.\\" However the selectors did not have faith in Inverarity's ability at test level. Yallop won man of the match for 45 in a Gillette Cup game, the quarter final where Victoria defeated NSW by five wickets. (The later made 59 in the same competition.) The unprepared and unsupported Yallop made a na√Øve prediction before the series when he said that his team would win 6‚Äì0. Yallop was \\"bewildered\\" when his \\"flippant\\" prediction was reported straight-faced by the media and taken seriously by the English players. In the first test, Australia won the toss and Yallop elected to bat. He scored 7 in Australia's first innings total of 116; England were dismissed for 286. Australia were 3‚Äì49 in the second innings when Yallop (102) and Kim Hughes (129) took Australia to 3-219 - but once Yallop was dismissed the other batsmen were unable to follow up and Australia were all out for 339. England scored the 170 runs needed for the loss of only three wickets. Yallop made 100 and 48 against NSW in a Sheffield Shield game. In the second test, Yallop won the toss and sent England into bat; they scored 309 and Australia responded with 190 (Yallop 3). England made 208 in their secong innings and Australia were dimissed for 161 (Yallop 3), losing by 166 runs. The third test was at the MCG. Yallop won this third toss in a row and decided to bat. Australia made 258, with Yallop's 41 being the second highest score. England were dismissed for 143, and Australia's second innings of 167 (Yallop 16) proved adequate when England were bowled out for 179, giving Australia a win by 103 runs. It would be Yallop's only test victory as captain. In the 4th test England won the toss, decided to bat, and were dismissed for 152. Australia responded with 296 (Yallop 44) and were in an excellent position to win the match. However England made 346 in their second innings, Australia collapsed for 111 (Yallop 1) and England won the game by 93 runs. Yallop played a Shield game against WA making 1 and 43. \\"I found Graham Yallop very easy to get along with,‚Äù recalled Maclean. ‚ÄúIf it it‚Äôd been two-all after Sydney, and the side had gone on, Yallop might be viewed quite differently.‚Äù In the 5th test Yallop won the toss and elected to bowl. England made 169 (being 5‚Äì27 at one stage). Australia scored 164 in reply (Yallop 0). England 360 in their second innings (at one time being 6-132) and Australia were dismissed for 169 (Yallop 36), losing by 205 runs. and 121 and 17 in the last. In the one day internationals that summer Yallop made 31, and 25. For the 6th test at the SCG, Yallop won the toss and elected to bat. Australia were dismissed for 198 of which Yallop scored 121; the next highest score was 16. Yallop later said this was his greatest test innings. England made 308 for their first innings; Australia collapsed for 141 (Yallop 17) and England won by nine wickets. Yallop elected to open the bowling in England's second innings with the old ball. Yallop won the man of the match award but Australia had lost the series 5‚Äì1. He was Australia's highest run scorer with 391 runs at 32.58. In his account of the 1978‚Äì79 Ashes series, The Ashes Retained, England captain Mike Brearley reported that the English players nicknamed Yallop \\"Banzai\\" because of his tendency to adopt suicidally attacking fields at all times, when on occasion a more defensive approach may have prevented the England team's free scoring. 1978‚Äì79 vs Pakistan In March 1978 Yallop led the team in a Test against Pakistan. He won the toss and decided to field; Pakistan were dismissed for 196. Australia collapsed for 168 (Yallop 25) and Pakistan put on 353 for the second innings. Australia fought back and were 3-305 (Yallop 8), when they collapsed again to be all out for 310, losing by 71 runs. Yallop injured his calf muscle in a club match, leading Richmond to victory in a district semi final (Yallop scored 90 not out). This forced him out of the second (and last) Test in the series; he was replaced by Jeff Moss as batsman and Kim Hughes as captain. Australia finally reversed their losing streak in that game under Hughes. This prompted the selectors to drop Yallop as captain in favour of Hughes permanently when Yallop returned from injury. \\"‚ÄúI was happy that I‚Äôd done it, and had the experience of captaining at the top level,\\" he later said. \\"But I was not unhappy about not doing it.‚Äù Lambs To the Slaughter At the end of the summer, a book came out under Yallop's name about his season's experiences, entitled Lambs To The Slaughter. On page one he commented that: > I should be bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because after so many > heartbreaks this was a rather ruthless end. I was the fall guy, the player > who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it > sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to > the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced > o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped > the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes > series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to > end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to > whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I > tried so hard, and so did the young, raw team that took on so much despite > all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the > man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.Yallop > p1-2 There were chapter headings such as \\"Sacked\\", \\"The First Killing\\", \\"Skinned Alive\\", and \\"Slaughtered\\". However the book was written by a ghost writer and it turned out that Yallop did not read it prior to publication. He later took legal action to stop sections of the book being published, but this was withdrawn. 1979 World Cup Yallop kept his place in the team after losing the captaincy, playing in the 1979 World Cup and all 6 tests in the tour of India in late 1979, the last tests before the WSC reunification. However Andrew Hilditch was chosen as vice captain. Yallop had a poor World Cup with scores of 10, 37 and 13. 1979 India Tour Yallop had a decent tour of India. He was the most experienced Australian batsman in a squad that also included Hughes, Alan Border, Dav Whatmore, Wood, Hilditch, and Rick Darling. He made 83 in the first game against North Zone and 56 against South Zone, both times batting at number five. Yallop also batted at five for the first test, but only made 18 and 2, while both Hughes and Border scored centuries. In the second test he scored 12 and 6. Both games ended in a draw. In a tour game against Central Zone, Yallop was promoted to number three for the first innings and made 21, then was opener in the second innings, scoring 40 not out. In the third test Yallop went back to number five, top scoring in Austraia's first innings with 89; however he only made 15 in the second innings as Australia collapsed and lost the game. In the f4th test, Yallop made 21 and 25, helping secure a draw. Yallop played as wicketkeeper and opener in a tour game against East Zone, making 81 and 21 in a game Australia lost by five wickets. Ki Hughes kept on Yallop as opener in the fifth test - the batsman responded with a first innings of 167, his highest test score to date (he only made 4 in the second innings). He was kept as opener for the sixth and last test, making 60 (Australia's top score) and 4. Yallop, with 423 test runs at 38, was Australia's best performing batsman on the trip after Alan Border and Kim Hughes. He had scored 729 first class runs at 48.60. Post-WSC At the end of 1979 the WSC split ended, and WSC players were now eligible for selection, including such names as Ian and Greg Chappell, Rick McCosker, and David Hookes. Yallop was kept on as Victorian captain for the 1979‚Äì80, although Richie Robinson, captain in 1976‚Äì77, returned to the side. Yallop began the season moderately, scoring 0 and 2 against WA, 0 and 49 against South Australia, and 51 and 22 against NSW. He later made 55 and 22 against WA and 65 against Qld. In Gillette Cup games he made 51, 36 and 41. Yallop was not picked for the test side that summer, the selectors preferring Bruce Laird, Rick McCosker and Julian Weiner as openers, and the Chappell brothers, Border, Hughes and Hookes down the order. It had been his least successful first class season since 1972‚Äì73, making 266 runs at 33.25. However Yallop was selected for a solitary one-day international, making 11 against the West Indies. He was also picked on the tour of Pakistan. 1980 Tour of Pakistan Yallop played in a tour game against the BCCP President's XI, making 46 in the first innings. He regained his place in the test team, playing as opener alongside Bruce Laird. He 12 and 16, with Australia losing by 7 wickets. Yallop kept his place in the second test. Batting down the order at number five he made 172, his highest first class score to date (taking part in a 217 run partnership with Greg Chappell); the game ended in a draw. In the third test, Yallop made 3 and 34 in the third. His 237 test rus at 47.4 was Australia's third highest after Greg Chappell and Alan Border. 1980 Centenary Test Yallop kept his spot in the Australian squad to tour England in 1980 for the second Centenary test. He made 45 in a tour game against Hampshire, followed by 0 and 1 against Surrey, 26 against Lancashire, and 13 and 21 against Nottinghamshire. Yallop was kept in the side to play the one test on that tour, the Centenary Test at Lords but he only made 2. He made 0 in the first ODI and 52 in the second. While on tour Yallop resigned as captain of Victoria. \\"I am resigning because I would like to continue to play for Australia as long as I possibly can, and I want to put all my efforts into playing cricket for Australia\\",' he said in a statement in August 1980. \\"I feel I couldn't justify being Victorian captain and giving the wholehearted effort required, while still giving my best efforts.\\" 1980‚Äì81 Yallop was not picked for Australia over the 1980‚Äì81 summer. He began the domestic season slowly and did not find form until the middle of the summer, losing his spot to Doug Walters who was experience a resurgence in form. Yallop scored 33 and 40 against West Australia, 7 against Queensland, 59 and 51 against New Zealand), 7 and 5 against WA, 13 against South Australia, and 10 and 25 against NSW. Eventually his form turned around: he made 121 and 2 against Tasmania, 52 and 70 against NSW, 0 and 64 against India, 28 and 21 against Queensland and 122 and 66 against South Australia. In domestic one day games Yallop made 1, 22, and 3. In February 1981 Ian Chappell included Yallop in his Ashes squad saying he was \\"the best middle order batsman outside the test team\\" but that he \\"needs to learn that a bit of pain has to be suffered to consistently succeed in test cricket.\\" Yallop ended the summer with 796 first class runs at 44.22, which earned him selection on the 1981 tour of England (Walters was omitted despite an excellent summer). Greg Chappell elected to not tour. A report called Yallop \\"one of the few class batsman in the country, albeit with an unhappy knack of failing when most selectorial eyes are on him.\\" 1981 Ashes Yallop played Sri Lanka in a first class match on the way to England, scoring 25 and 13. He made 2 and 46 in one day games. In England, Yallop began the tour slowly, like most Australian batsmen. He scored 9 against Hampshire, 49 not out against Somerset, 0 against Glamorgan, and 16 and 52 not out against Middlesex. Yallop was Australia's most consistent batsman in the 3-match ODI series, with scores of 52, 63 and 48. Yallop was picked to play in the first test. He made only 13 and 6, batting at number three, but Australia won by 4 wickets. He made 45 in a tour match against Kent then only 1 and 3 in the second test, which ended in a draw. In a tour game against Northamptonshire Yallop made only 16. Yallop kept his spot in the side for the third test, which became one of the most famous cricket matches in history. Yallop scored 58 in Australia's first innings total of 401; England were dismissed for 174 and were 7‚Äì135 in the second innings when Ian Botham inspired a comeback to take England to 356, setting Australia 129 to win. Australia were 1-56 before collapsing to be all out for 111, Yallop scoring 0. In the fourth test, England were dismissed for 189. Australia made 258 in response (Yallop 30). England scored 219 in their second innings, setting Australia 140 to win. Yallop came to the wicket at 3-29, and helped take the score to 3-87, making 30. His dismissal helped trigger a collapse and Australia were dismissed for 121. It was during this game that Kim Hughes notorious tried to protect Yallop from facing the fast bowling of Bob Wllis. Yallop made 49 and 59 against Essex. In the fourth test England made 231 and Australia replied with 130 (Yallop 0). England's second innings of 404 set Australia 505 to win. Yallop came out to bat at 2-24. He scored 114 runs, reading his century off only 116 balls, but Australia were all out for 402. Yallop made 13 against Sussex and 26 and 35 in the last test. Although it had been a patchy tour for Yallop, he was Australia's highest scoring batsman in the tests after Border, with 316 runs at 26.33, although only the fourth highest run scorer in all games, with 624 runs at 32.84. Much was made of Yallop's susceptibility to fast bowling because of an unusual incident on the 1981 tour of England. Skipper Kim Hughes shepherded him from Bob Willis's bowling, even though Yallop never asked him to. Commentating on the match, Richie Benaud called Hughes's actions \\"as curious a captaincy decision as I have ever seen\\". 1981‚Äì82 Yallop began the 1981‚Äì82 season strongly: 82 and 31 against Queensland, 46 and 3 against Tasmania, 36 and 68 against the touring Pakistan side. He was kept in the Australia side for the first test against Pakistan making 20 and 38, in a game Australia comfortably won. However Yallop then injured his back and did not play for Australia for the rest of the summer. He returned to the Victorian side in December making 24 and 10, 19 and 9, 55 and 7, 111 and 20 and 14 and 54. In one day state games he made 17, 28, and 13. Yallop made 647 first class runs that summer at 38.05, and was overlooked for the Australian tour of Pakistan in 1982, the selectors preferring to take Greg Ritchie and Wayne Phillips. It was the first official overseas tour Yallop had missed since the 1977 Ashes. Career Peak=1982‚Äì83 Return to State Captaincy Yallop was reappointed captain for the 1982‚Äì83 season. He had a golden run of form that summer, but was unable to break into the Australian side (the middle order consisted of Chappell, Border, Hughes and David Hookes, who were all consistently scoring runs). Yallop made 28 and 151 against South Australia (a game famous for David Hookes' lightning fast century), 84 and 58 against WA, 8 and 47 against Tasmania, 20 and 73, 69 and 24 against England,, 38 and 33 against New Zealand, 15 and 38 against New South Wales, 23 and 13 against Tasmania, 69 against WA, 109 and 86 against NSW, 18 and 168 against South Australia, and 246 against Queensland. In domestic one day games he made 21, 21, 7, and 12. Yallop had scored 1,418 first class runs that summer at 67.52, beating Bill Ponsford's record for the most runs in a season. This earned him selection on the 1983 tour of Sri Lanka. 1983 Sri Lanka Tour Kim Hughes did not tour Sri Lanka, opening up a spot in the batting line up. Yallop made 43 and 30 in a tour game and was picked in the solo test on the tour. Yallop made 98 in a game comfortably won by Australia. In the ODIs he made 39, 59, 51 and 60 not out. Victoria offered David Hookes the state captaincy, which annoyed Yallop, who considered an offer to move to Tasmania. However Hookes decided to stay in South Australia. 1983 World Cup Yallop was picked in the Australia squad to contest the 1983 ODI World Cup. He was one of Australia's most consistent batsmen, scoring 2, 29, 66 not out against India, 20, 52 not out and 18. 1983‚Äì84 vs Pakistan Yallop's peak as a test player came during the 1983‚Äì84 season, when Pakistan toured Australia. Yallop began the summer with 77 and 23 against NSW and 91 in a one-day state game. He was picked in the first test side over David Hookes. Yallop, batting at three, made 141, taking part in a 259 run partnership with Wayne Phillips. He made 113 and 145 for Victoria against WA, then scored 33 in the second test. In a Victoria-Pakistan tour game, Yallop made 220. In the third test he made 68 and 14. The 4th test at the MCG saw Yallop hit 268, his highest first class score to date. A contemporary report said \\"that Yallop should be the celebrity of the Australian team demonstrates again cricket's delightful uncertainty.\\" It quoted Arthur Morris who called him \\"a beautiful player of spin and medium pace\\" and Lindsay Hassett who said \\"I can't think of any player who has been treated worse.\\" He would only play two more tests. A knock of 30 in the 5th test brought Yallop's series tally to 554 runs at an average of 92.33, comfortably the best result of any Australian batsman. He had scored 1132 first class runs that summer at 113.20. Yallop was picked on the 1983‚Äì84 tour of the West Indies. However he was injured while fielding during the sole ODI he played for Australia (where he made 13 batting at number ten).Daunting Mission for Australians, New Straits Times, 16 February 1984 This meant he missed the tour, being replaced by Dean Jones. 1984 Tour of India Yallop toured India with the Australians in 1984 playing in a five-match ODI series. He made 22, 32 and 42. South African Rebel Tours=1984‚Äì85: Last First Class Season in Australia Yallop worked on his knee through 1984. Yallop scored only 0 and 2 in a Victoria-Queensland Sheffield Shield game and 14 in a state one day game.6 He was picked in the first test against the touring West Indian side. Yallop scored 2 and 1, with Australia losing by an innings and 112 runs. He had a leg injury ad a knee operation which took him out of a lot of the season. He returned to first class cricket in January doing poorly against Queensland (21 and 0) and South Australia (34 and 1). He then made 58 and 125 against NSW leading to him being discussed as a prospect for the 1985 Ashes. He made 51 and 22 against Tasmania and 147 and 8 against Victoria. He made 41 in a one-day game for Victoria against England. Yallop ended the summer with 472 first class runs at 36.3 and was overlooked for the side to tour England in 1985. In May 1985 it was revealed Yallop had signed as a member of the rebel Australian team which ended up being led by Kim Hughes. Yallop was to be Hughes' vice captain. \\"A number of us were given the word that the selectors didn't see us as having any future as Test players,\\" said Yallop. \\"We were told ‚Äì quietly, of course ‚Äì that our futures weren't exactly rosy. So when the approach came, we were interested.\\" Along with the other tourists, Yallop was banned for two years from Australian first class cricket, and three years from official international cricket. 1985‚Äì86 Yallop's first summer in South Africa was not successful. He began well with tour game scores of 35 and 62, then his form fell away: 6, 7, and 26. In the first \\"test\\" Yallop made 51 and 24. After 15 and 20 in a tour game he made 20 and 6 in another test. He scored 272 first class runs that summer at 27.20. Captain Kim Hughes publicly criticised Yallop's contribution over the tour, saying \\"Yallop's unavailability has cost us dearly on tour. Had Yallop been fit and in the right frame of mind ... you've got to want to play. As vice-captain you've got a huge responsibility. People such as [Mick] Taylor, who had no reputations, have made one for themselves, while Yallop, who had all the reputation, has not really done anything.\\" 1986‚Äì87 Yallop resigned from the Australian vice captaincy for the second summer and performed a lot better. His first class scores were 31, 45, 96, 34 and 15, 182, 4. He made 36 and 26 in a test, then 14 and 69 against Northern Transvaal, his last first class game. He made 552 first class runs at 61.33. Final years After two seasons in South Africa, Yallop returned to the relative obscurity of district cricket in Melbourne, playing for the South Melbourne and Ringwood clubs. He never played first class cricket again. The majority of the rebel tourists were embraced by their old states but not the Victorians (Mick Taylor, Rod Hogg and Yallop). Yallop says they were \\"shunned by the Victorian Cricket Association... We knew the VCA wouldn't pick us. It was disappointing, we could've given a lot to the game at that stage; we weren't that old. But we were certainly shunned by the association.\\" Yallop later said he had \\"mixed emotions\\" about the rebel tours. \\"Knowing now what it was like there, there were certain things they kept from us, certain things we weren't meant to see but did. But hindsight is a wonderful thing, isn't it? Certainly we enjoyed it while we were there. But reflecting on it, there's mixed emotions. Disappointing thing, politics.\\" Appraisal Yallop must carry some blame for this fickleness. Englishman Mike Brearley (his opposite number in the 1978‚Äì79 series) noted that Yallop used to \\"... slide his back foot to and fro in a grandmotherly shuffle ... More than most Test players, Yallop can range from the inept to the masterly.\\" Undoubtedly, Yallop was more at home against slow bowling and was considered one of the best players of spinners during an era when few existed. Although not ideally suited to the one-day game, Yallop's ODI figures are good and he played in the World Cups of 1979 and 1983 and toured India in 1984. He was a safe fielder behind the wicket and was often positioned in the gully. Graham Yallop's Test career batting performance. Yallop averaged better than one century every five Tests and never went more than six consecutive Tests without a hundred. He also jointly holds the record for the fastest Ashes half-century, scored off 35 balls in the Old Trafford test in the 1981 series. Christian Ryan once wrote of him: > If you were given three words to sum up the cricket career of Graham > Yallop... what would you say? Australia's Lousiest Captain? Solid And > Reliable? Dodgy Against Pace? A Bit Boring? There is a dollop of truth in > them all.

Graham Yallop in > three words? Unlucky Uncelebrated Unmissed seem to fit best, more's the > pity. Post-cricket career In 1989 Yallop was fined $1,000 for selling alcohol at his cricket centre. In 1994 he was sacked as manager of a sports centre but successfully appealed the decision. In 2014‚Äì15 Yallop was appointed chief coach of the Elwood Cricket Club. Is currently working as a coach/ facilitator for the Shaun Brown Cricket Coaching tours. Yallop has worked closely with Indonesian cricket, coaching and fund raising, including donating one of his baggy green caps for auction, for its development. In appreciation, the premier cricketing ground in Jakarta was named the Graham Yallop Oval in his honour.Nicholls, p. 256. ReferencesSources *Nicholls, B.

The turbo button is the right small button, whereas the left small button is the reset button which still exists in computers ; the triangular button is the power button. On personal computers, the turbo button is a button which provides two run states for the computer: normal speed or an enhanced \\"turbo\\" speed. It was relatively common on personal computers using the Intel 80286,20-MHz 286 PCs, PC Magazine, June 27, 1989 Intel 80386 and Intel 80486 processors,Turbo button, Computer Hope, 10-17-2017 from the mid 1980s to mid 1990s. The name is inspired by turbocharger, a turbine-driven forced induction device that increases an engine's power and efficiency.  Effect  Contrary to what its name suggests, the \\"turbo\\" button was intended to let a computer run slower than the speed for which it had been designed. With the introduction of CPUs which ran faster than the original 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 used in the IBM Personal Computer, programs which relied on the CPU's frequency for timing were executing faster than intended. Games in particular were often rendered unplayable. To provide some compatibility, the \\"turbo\\" button was added. Disengaging turbo mode slows the system down to a state compatible with original 8086/8088 chips. The average user, who was not relying on outdated software, would have wanted to take care that they always had turbo mode activated, to get the most performance out of their computer.  Switching  On most systems, turbo mode was with the button pushed in, but since the button could often be wired either way, on some systems it was the opposite. On some systems the turbo button was linked to a turbo LED or two-digit segmented display on the system case, although in almost all cases, the indicated frequency (in MHz) wasn't a measure of the actual processor clocks, but the two \\"fast\\" and \\"slow\\" display options set by jumpers on the motherboard (or a daughterboard linked to the button), or on some later machines, set in the BIOS software. Some systems also supported keyboard combinations -- and -- for switching turbo mode on and off; ITT Xtra used -- to toggle. Some keyboards had a turbo button as well, located near right Shift. Unlike the turbo button that was common on computer cases, the turbo button on the keyboards did not control the clock rate of the CPU; rather, it controlled the keyboard repeat rate.  Use  The feature was relatively common on systems running 286 to 486 CPUs, and rarely on first generation Pentium CPU equipped computers. The MHz displays largely disappeared or were reprogrammed to display \\"HI\\"/\\"LO\\" when CPU speeds reached 100 MHz, since most systems only had a two-digit display. As new PC computers continued to get faster and had a wide variety of available speeds, it became impossible for software to rely on specific CPU speed. As software began to rely on other timing methods, turbo became mostly irrelevant to new programs. 1988 game advertising automatic compensation for CPU speed.  Software implementations  While the implementation of an actual hardware turbo button has disappeared on modern machines, software developers have compensated with software replacements. One example is DOSBox, which offers an adjustable emulation rate. Modern PCs that support ACPI power management may provide software controls to switch ACPI performance states or other CPU throttling modes. This is used for power saving or to prevent CPU overheating rather than for compatibility because modern applications use the real time clock for timing instead of the CPU clock.

It was among the cryptographic techniques recommended for Japanese government use by CRYPTREC in 2003, however, has been dropped to \\"candidate\\" by CRYPTREC revision in 2013. MUGI takes a 128-bit secret key and a 128-bit initial vector (IV). After a key- and IV- setup process, MUGI outputs 64-bit output strings based on the internal state, while updating the internal state after each output block. MUGI has a 1216-bit internal state; there are three 64-bit registers (the \\"state\\") and 16 64-bit registers (the \\"buffer\\"). MUGI uses the non-linear S-box that was originally defined in Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). A part of the linear transformation also reuses the MDS matrix of AES. The basic design is influenced by that of Panama. Security As of September 2006, there are no known attacks against MUGI that are faster than serial brute-force of the key space or of the internal state. In the paper, \\"A weakness of the linear part of stream cipher MUGI\\", by Golic Jovan Dj, Roy Bimal and Meier Willi, the abstract claims: \\"The linearly updated component of the stream cipher MUGI, called the buffer, is analyzed theoretically by using the generating function method. In particular, it is proven that the intrinsic response of the buffer, without the feedback from the nonlinearly updated component, consists of binary linear recurring sequences with small linear complexity 32 and with extremely small period 48. It is then shown how this weakness can in principle be used to facilitate the linear cryptanalysis of MUGI with two main objectives: to reconstruct the secret key and to find linear statistical distinguishers.\\" In the paper, \\"Analysis of the Non-linear Part of Mugi\\" by Alex Biryukov and Adi Shamir, the abstract claims: \\"This paper presents the results of a preliminary analysis of the stream cipher Mugi. We study the nonlinear component of this cipher and identify several potential weaknesses in its design. While we can not break the full Mugi design, we show that it is extremely sensitive to small variations. For example, it is possible to recover the full 1216-bit state of the cipher and the original 128-bit secret key using just 56 words of known stream and in 214 steps of analysis if the cipher outputs any state word which is different than the one used in the actual design. If the linear part is eliminated from the design, then the secret non-linear 192-bit state can be recovered given only three output words and in just 232 steps. If it is kept in the design but in a simplified form, then the scheme can be broken by an attack which is slightly faster than exhaustive search.\\" References  External links * MUGI homepage Category:Stream ciphers ","title":"MUGI"},{"id":"1508243","text":"A push-button (also spelled pushbutton) or simply button is a simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal. The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed. Buttons are most often biased switches, although many un-biased buttons (due to their physical nature) still require a spring to return to their un-pushed state. Terms for the \\"pushing\\" of a button include pressing, depressing, mashing, slapping, hitting, and punching.  Uses  Buttons on a handheld calculator. The \\"push-button\\" has been utilized in calculators, push-button telephones, kitchen appliances, and various other mechanical and electronic devices, home and commercial. In industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be connected together by a mechanical linkage so that the act of pushing one button causes the other button to be released. In this way, a stop button can \\"force\\" a start button to be released. This method of linkage is used in simple manual operations in which the machine or process has no electrical circuits for control. Red pushbuttons can also have large heads (called mushroom heads) for easy operation and to facilitate the stopping of a machine. These pushbuttons are called emergency stop buttons and for increased safety are mandated by the electrical code in many jurisdictions. This large mushroom shape can also be found in buttons for use with operators who need to wear gloves for their work and could not actuate a regular flush-mounted push button. Button shaped as an octagon. As an aid for operators and users in industrial or commercial applications, a pilot light is commonly added to draw the attention of the user and to provide feedback if the button is pushed. Typically this light is included into the center of the pushbutton and a lens replaces the pushbutton hard center disk. The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls. In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start. To avoid an operator from pushing the wrong button in error, pushbuttons are often color-coded to associate them with their function. Commonly used colors are red for stopping the machine or process and green for starting the machine or process. In popular culture, the phrase \\"the button\\" (sometimes capitalized) refers to a (usually fictional) button that a military or government leader could press to launch nuclear weapons.  Scram and scramble switches  Akin to fire alarm switches, some big red buttons, when deployed with suitable visual and audible warnings such as flashing lights and sirens for extreme exigent emergencies, are known as \\"scram switches\\" (from the slang term scram, \\"get out of here\\"). Generally, such buttons are connected to large scale functions, beyond a regular fire alarm, such as automated shutdown procedures, complete facility power cut, fire suppression like halon release, etc. A variant of this is the scramble switch which triggers an alarm to activate emergent personnel to proactively attend to and go to such disasters. An air raid siren at an air base initiates such action, where the fighter pilots are alerted and \\"scrambled\\" to their planes to defend the base.

Also known as the E-R, the newspaper was first published in Bidwell Bar, California as the Butte Record in 1853 and is now part of the MediaNews Group corporation, who took control of the paper from Donrey in 1999. Donrey had owned the paper since March 14, 1983. The paper has a circulation of less than 10,000 and also publishes supplements, like \\"The North Valley Employment Guide\\", \\"The Real Estate Guide\\", \\"HomeStyle Magazine.\\" Editions of the Enterprise-Record include the Oroville Mercury-Register. Throughout its history as the Enterprise-Record, the newspaper has never missed a scheduled publication day. There have been several challenges to that accomplishment, including an earthquake in August 1975 which knocked out power to the newspaper's offices for several hours. The shock measured 5.7 ML and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), causing $3 million in damage and injuring 10. History The Enterprise-Record is the result of the merger of the Chico Enterprise and the Chico Record on Dec. 6, 1948. Both predecessor publications had a long and storied history throughout the north valley of the Sacramento River. The Chico Record can trace its roots to the Butte Record. The Butte Record moved publication from Bidwell Bar to Oroville in 1856 where it was briefly known as the Oroville Union Record from 1864 to 1866. The publication would relocate to Chico in 1873 and after the acquisition of the Chico Chronicle became the Chico Morning Chronicle-Record. The name was winnowed back to Chico Record after new owners purchased the paper in 1897. The Chico Enterprise originated in 1859 as the Tehama Tocsin in Tehama, California. It relocated to Red Bluff, California and, later, to Chico where it was renamed the Northern Enterprise. The name was later shorted to the Enterprise. The Enterprise and the Record were among many newspapers that were published in Chico in the 1860s. Other publications included the Chico Index, Chico Courant and the California Caucasian. The Caucasian was reportedly a central force in fomenting the atmosphere of hate and bigotry which led to the burning of Chico's then-\\"Chinatown\\" in 1877 (https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035004/http://www.what-you- see.com/calif/chico.htm). Ultimately, the Enterprise and the Record emerged as Chico's two primary newspapers. They competed against each other through the 1940s. They published together for the first time in a single combined edition in October 1946 due to a printer's strike. The Enterprise and the Record consolidated ownership in Nov. 13, 1947 when Record owners, Stanley and Samuel Beaubaire, sold their paper to the Chico Enterprise. Enterprise Publishing Co. published separate editions of the Enterprise and the Record until Dec. 6, 1948 when they were merged into the Chico Enterprise-Record. After merging, the paper was published in the afternoons Monday through Friday and on Saturday mornings. The newspaper's office and printing presses were at 700 Broadway. On March 14, 1983, more than a century of local ownership ended when the publication was sold to Donrey Media Group of Fort Smith, Ark. One change was the introduction of a Sunday morning edition on Oct. 30, 1983. The E-R shifted to an entirely morning newspaper on Sept. 8, 1992. The Enterprise- Record also moved its operation to its current offices and printing presses at 400 E. Park Ave. on Aug. 22, 1987. The ribbon cutting included Butte County Supervisor Jane Dolan, Chico Mayor Mary Andrews and Donrey founder Donald W. Reynolds.  National Influence and Coverage  In November 2018, the editor of the Enterprise-Record took a photo of Camp Fire, then consuming Paradise, California. The iconic photograph, taken with an iPhone camera, appeared on the websites of the New York Times, Washington Post, and Time magazine. The Los Angeles Times would later run an article detailing the efforts taken by the little paper to cover the tragedy, recognizing the staff for performing at \\"the highest of levels.\\" References External links *Official Site Category:Daily newspapers published in California ER Category:MediaNews Group publications Category:Publications established in 1853 Category:1853 establishments in California ","title":"Chico Enterprise-Record"},{"id":"1508286","text":"Edmund Wade Davis (born December 14, 1953) is a Canadian-U.S.-Colombian cultural anthropologist, ethnobotanist, author, and photographer whose work has focused on worldwide indigenous cultures, especially in North America and South America and particularly involving the traditional uses and beliefs associated with psychoactive plants. Davis came to prominence with his 1985 best-selling book The Serpent and the Rainbow about the zombies of Haiti. Davis is professor of anthropology and the BC Leadership Chair in Cultures and Ecosystems at Risk at the University of British Columbia. Davis has published articles in Outside, National Geographic, Fortune, and Cond√© Nast Traveler. Davis is an Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic Society. His work has taken him to East Africa, Borneo, Nepal, Peru, Polynesia, Tibet, Mali, Benin, Togo, New Guinea, Australia, Colombia, Vanuatu, Mongolia, and the high Arctic of Nunavut and Greenland. He was granted Colombian nationality and citizenship in April 2018. Early life, family, and education Davis was born in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He holds degrees in anthropology and biology and received his Ph.D. in ethnobotany, all from Harvard University. In 1974, at age 20, he crossed the Darien Gap on foot in the company of the English author and amateur explorer, Sebastian Snow. Career Davis is not only an ethnographer, writer, photographer, and filmmaker, he also is a licensed river guide and has worked as park ranger and a forestry engineer. Anthropology and ethnobotany Mostly through the Harvard Botanical Museum, he spent more than three years in the Amazon and Andes as a plant explorer, living among fifteen indigenous groups in eight Latin American nations while making some 6,000 botanical collections. He also conducted ethnographic fieldwork among several indigenous societies of northern Canada. His work later took him to Haiti to investigate folk preparations implicated in the creation of zombies, an assignment that led to his writing Passage of Darkness (1988) and The Serpent and the Rainbow (1986), an international bestseller. The book was used loosely as the basis of a Wes Craven horror film, The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988). Other books by Davis include Penan: Voice for the Borneo Rain Forest (1990), Shadows in the Sun (1998), Nomads of the Dawn (1995), The Clouded Leopard (1998), Rainforest (1998), Light at the Edge of the World (2001), The Lost Amazon (2004), Grand Canyon (2008), Book of Peoples of the World (ed. 2008), and One River (1996), which was nominated for the 1997 Governor General's Literary Award for nonfiction. His books have been translated into fourteen languages, including Basque, Serbian, Japanese, and Malay. He has published 1800 popular articles on subjects ranging from Haitian vodoun, Amazonian myth and religion, the traditional use of psychotropic drugs, the ethnobotany of South American Indians, as well as, how COVID-19 has signaled the end of the American era.https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/covid-19-end- of-american-era-wade-davis-1038206/ Davis has written for National Geographic, Newsweek, Premiere, Outside, Omni, Harpers, Fortune, Men's Journal, Cond√© Nast Traveler, Natural History, Scientific American, National Geographic Traveler, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The Globe and Mail, Rolling Stone, and numerous other international publications. Davis is a Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers (iLCP). Photography His photographs have appeared in some 20 books and more than 80 magazines, journals, and newspapers, including National Geographic, Time, GEO, People, Men's Journal, Outside, and National Geographic Adventure. They have been exhibited at the International Center of Photography (ICP), the Marsha Ralls Gallery (Washington, D.C.), the United Nations (Cultures on the Edge exhibition 2004), the Carpenter Center of Harvard University, and the Utama Center (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia). Some of his images are part of the permanent collection of the U.S. State Department, Africa and Latin America Bureaus. Davis is the co-curator of The Lost Amazon: The Photographic Journey of Richard Evans Schultes, first exhibited at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, and currently touring Latin America. A first collection of Davis's photographs, Light at the Edge of the World, appeared in 2001 published by National Geographic Books, Bloomsbury, and Douglas & McIntyre. A second collection was under contract for 2013 publication with Douglas & McIntyre as well. Lectures and education Davis's research has inspired numerous documentary films as well as three episodes of the television series The X-Files. He has been lecturing since the 1990s at various institutions. In late 2013, it was announced that Davis would join the University of British Columbia as a professor of anthropology in the summer of 2014. Filmmaking and other media involvement Davis was the series creator, host, and co-writer of Light at the Edge of the World, a four- hour ethnographic documentary series, shot in Rapa Nui, Tahiti, the Marquesas, Nunavut, Greenland, Nepal, and Peru, which aired in 165 countries on the National Geographic Channel and in the USA on Smithsonian Networks. He is featured in the MacGillivray Freeman IMAX film Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk, released in the spring of 2008. Other television credits include the award-winning documentaries Spirit of the Mask, Cry of the Forgotten People, Forests Forever, and Earthguide, a 13-part television series on the environment that aired on the Discovery Channel in 1990. His four-hour series with National Geographic, Ancient Voices / Modern World, was shot in Australia, Mongolia, and Colombia. It has been broadcast worldwide on the National Geographic Channel as part of the second season of Light at the Edge of the World. Advisory work An honorary research associate of the Institute of Economic Botany of the New York Botanical Garden, he is a Fellow of the Linnean Society, a Fellow of the Explorer's Club, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and a Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Davis was a founding board member of the David Suzuki Foundation and completed a six-year term on the board of the Banff Centre, a Canadian institution for the arts. He has served on the board of directors since 2009 for the Amazon Conservation Association, whose mission is to conserve the biological diversity of the Amazon. In 2009, he delivered the CBC Massey Lectures, Canada's most prestigious public intellectual forum. He is a member of the International Advisory Board, Hunt Consolidated, PLNG, and has also been engaged in Journey to Zero, a three-year campaign sponsored by Nissan and TBWA to support zero emission vehicles. Criticisms of work in Haiti In 1983, Davis first advanced his hypothesis that tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning could explain the existence of Haitian zombies. This idea has been controversial and his 1985 follow-up book (The Serpent and the Rainbow) elaborating upon this claim has been criticized as containing a number of scientific inaccuracies. One of these is the suggestion that Haitian witchdoctors can keep \\"zombies\\" in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years. As part of his Haitian investigations, Davis commissioned the exhumation of a recently buried child. (Dead human tissue is supposed to be a part of the \\"zombie powder\\" used by witchdoctors to produce zombies.) This has been criticized in the professional literature as a breach of ethics. The strictly scientific criticism of Davis's zombie project has focused on the claims about the chemical composition of the \\"zombie powder\\". Several samples of the powder were analyzed for TTX levels by experts in 1986. They reported that only \\"insignificant traces of tetrodotoxin [were found] in the samples of 'zombie powder' which were supplied for analysis by Davis\\" and that \\"it can be concluded that the widely circulated claim in the lay press to the effect that tetrodotoxin is the causal agent in the initial zombification process is without factual foundation\\". Davis's claims were subsequently defended by other scientists doing further analyses, and these findings were criticized in turn for poor methodology and technique by the original skeptics. Aside from the question of whether or not \\"zombie powder\\" contains significant amounts of TTX, the underlying concept of \\"tetrodotoxin zombification\\" has also been questioned more directly on a physiological basis. TTX, which blocks sodium channels on the neural membrane, produces numbness, slurred speech, and possibly, paralysis or even respiratory failure and death in severe cases. As an isolated pharmacological agent, it is not known to produce the trance-like or \\"mental slave\\" state typical of the zombies of Haitian mythology, or of Davis's descriptions. This criticism can be countered by pointing to the datura mentioned in Davis's research. In and of itself, datura can produce these trance-like symptoms, and if a part of regular meals, could cause (or contribute to) the maintained stupor. Datura ingestions may present with prolonged toxic effects lasting hours to days. Biochemist Jessika Jake has noted that Bromism also may be at play here. In his account of his release, Clairvius Narcisse reported that the master's wife fed salt to the enslaved and set them free. Administering NaCl helps the body excrete bromide, and thus is a known treatment for bromism. Symptoms of bromism include stupor, slurred speech, abnormal gait, and other symptoms described in zombie folklore (such as \\"behavior [that] can become violent, especially at night\\", skin rashes, and enlarged pupils).Rand.org Monograph Reports, Chapter 10 Bromism. Further investigation into the bromide source should be addressed, and may be as simple as the use of bromide salts when preparing food for the enslaved. Personal life Davis is married. He and his wife, Gail Percy, have lived in several places, sometimes with concurrent residences in Washington, D.C., Vancouver, the Stikine Valley of northern British Columbia, and Bowen Island near Vancouver. They have two adult daughters, Tara and Raina. On April 13, 2018, Davis was granted Colombian nationality by President Juan Manuel Santos.

His father was director of a printing works, but lost his job during the Depression, and Bland had to leave school to find work at 15. After a visit to the Soviet Union in 1937, Bland migrated to New Zealand in 1938-39. He returned to England in 1950. Before becoming a leading figure of the UK anti- revisionist movement, Bland was a member of the Communist Party of New Zealand and the Communist Party of Great Britain. Bland considered Mao Zedong a left- deviationist while still maintaining that Hoxha was a true Marxist-Leninist in the tradition of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Bland's line on Mao was problematic since Hoxha and Mao were strategic allies at that time. Bland's position was strengthened after the Sino-Albanian split and he formed the Communist League of Great Britain. Bland was one of the founders of the Albanian Society, and three years after its foundation he became its secretary, a post which he held almost continuously for 30 years until the fall of the communist regime in Albania. He was Editor of the journal of the society, Albanian Life. He also wrote an English-Albanian dictionary which included information on Albanian life, culture, politics and history. Together with the American Communist, Jack Shulman, he participated in the Alliance Marxist-Leninist (North America) and supported International Struggle Marxist- Leninist (ISML). In 1991, he helped found the Stalin Society, however, he was later expelled by a Maoist faction. Bland was the coauthor of A Tangled Web: A History Of Anglo-American Relations with Albania (1912-1955). Historian Peter R. Prifti described the book's treatment of the Corfu Channel incident as \\"a masterful exposition of that tragic incident, and a good indication of the level of scholarship that characterizes the contents of the book. . . this well-researched study by W. Bland and I. Price goes a long way to untangle the web, so that we may gain a clearer perspective on the subject.\\"Prifti, Peter R. Unfinished Portrait of a Country. 2005.

Blake wrote Songs of Innocence as a contrary to the Songs of Experience ‚Äì a central tenet in his philosophy and a central theme in his work.Kazin, Alfred. \\"Introduction\\". The Portable Blake. The Viking Portable Library. 41‚Äì43. Like many of Blake's works, the poem is about Christianity. The lamb is a common metaphor for Jesus Christ, who is also called \\"The Lamb of God\\" in John 1:29. This poem written in rhyming couplets, although the rhyme \\"lamb\\"/\\"name\\" is only approximate by modern standards. The first and last couplet in each stanza exhibit identical rhyme, as for example the first: \\"Little Lamb who made thee / Dost thou know who made thee\\". In the first stanza, the speaker asks the lamb who his creator is; the answer lies at the end of the poem. Here we find a physical description of the lamb, seen as a pure and gentle creature. In the second stanza, the lamb is compared with the infant Jesus, as well as between the lamb and the speaker's soul. In the last two lines, the speaker identifies the creator: God. Like the other Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, The Lamb may have been intended to be sung, but no records survive of Blake's own musical settings. It was set to music by Vaughan Williams in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs, although he described it as \\"that horrible little lamb ‚Äì a poem that I hate\\". It was also given a setting by Sir John Tavener, who explained: \\"The Lamb came to me fully grown and was written in an afternoon and dedicated to my nephew Simon for his 3rd birthday.\\" American poet Allen Ginsberg set the poem to music, along with several other of Blake's poems, in 1969 and was included on his album Songs of Innocence and Experience by William Blake.\\"Songs of Innocence and Experience by William Blake, tuned by Allen Ginsberg\\". Ginsberg's songs were re-worked by Steven Taylor for the album Songs of Innocence & of Experience: Shewing The Two Contrary States Of The Human Soul, released in 2019, by Ace Records, to coincide with the Blake exhibition at Tate Britain.

It is an area of some lying between the River Welland and River Nene and the towns of Stamford and Kettering. It has a rich and varied landscape, with farmland, open pasture, pockets of woodland and villages built from local stone. History The forest was named after the village of Rockingham, where the castle was a royal retreat. The boundaries were marked by the River Nene on the eastern side and on the western side what is now the A508 road from Market Harborough to Northampton. Over the years the forest shrank, and today only a patchwork of the north-eastern forest remains. The bulk of the remaining forest is located within a square, of which the corners are Corby, Kettering, Thrapston and Oundle. The area became a royal hunting ground for King William I after the Norman conquest. The term forest represented an area of legal jurisdiction and remained so until the 19th century. A Cistercian abbey was established in 1143 which became known as Pipewell Abbey. In 1298 the de Lacys were granted permission to inclose pertaining to the manor of Wadenhoe, lying within the forest, in order to make a park. The forest boundaries were set in 1299, although the boundaries returned to a smaller area as a result of King Charles I's actions. King Charles II took little interest in the forest and gave away or sold much of it. By 1792 there was no significant royal ownership of the forest area. Parliamentary enclosure of the bailiwicks and disafforestation of Rockingham bailiwick in 1832 resulted in a much smaller forest area with much of the land turned over to agriculture. The Forestry Commission took over the remnants of public woodland in 1923. The forest originally stretched from Stamford down to Northampton. Geology The forest extends across a tract of country underlain by sedimentary rocks of Jurassic age, a part of the great Jurassic escarpment stretching from the Cotswolds to the southwest through the East Midlands to the Humber via Lincoln Edge. Largely a mix of mudstone and limestone layers dipping gently eastwards, the sequence is this (in stratigraphic order i.e. youngest/uppermost at top): *Ancholme Group **Oxford Clay Formation *Great Oolite Group **Cornbrash Formation **Blisworth Clay Formation **Blisworth Limestone Formation **Rutland Formation *Inferior Oolite Group **Lincolnshire Limestone Formation **Grantham Formation **Northampton Sand Formation The plateau is largely covered by glacial till of a stony, clayey nature. Exploitation of the ironstone within the Northampton Sands was the basis for the once-important iron and steel industry in Corby on the western edge of the forest. Management Areas managed by the Forestry Commission include: * Southey Wood, Peterborough * Wakerley Great Wood * Bedford Purlieus National Nature Reserve * Fineshade Wood * Fermyn Woods It is famous for its population of red kites which now number 300.http://www.bbc.co.uk/naturescalendar/summer/woodlands/rockingham/rockingham.shtml Chequered skipper reintroduction In the spring of 2018 chequered skipper butterflies (Carterocephalus palaemon) from Belgium were released at a secret site as part of the Back from the Brink (BftB) project. A further release of butterflies from Belgium will take place in the spring of 2019, to supplement the newly emerged offspring of last years release. Invasive scrub has been removed from more than 8 km of woodland rides by Butterfly Conservation and their partners, and if the reintroduction is successful they will be the first native-born chequered skippers to emerge in England in more than 40 years.

Biography He was born in Amaliada (Peloponnese, Greece) in 1915. He came from a relatively prosperous family and went on to study Law in Athens, but before being able to graduate he was arrested and jailed in the Akronauplia prison (Nauplion) by the Ioannis Metaxas regime in the 1930s and transferred to the Germans after the Axis occupation of Greece (1941). He escaped in 1943 and joined the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) in Peloponnese in the side of Aris Velouchiotis. After becoming Political Commissioner of the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) during the Greek Civil War he was one of the last to leave the country (1949) after its defeat. Liakos, Antonis, and Marchetos, Spyros (2013), 'Nikos Beloyannis', in Lane, Thomas A. (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders, Vol. I: A-L. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. pp. 74-75 (p. 74). In June 1950 Beloyannis returned to Greece in order to re-establish the Athens organization of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) that had been declared illegal. He was arrested on 20 December 1950 and was taken before a court-martial on charges of violating Compulsory Law 509/1947, which criminalized KKE. He was accused of treason, allegedly having transmitted information to the Soviet Union. The Beloyannis trial started in Athens on 19 October 1951. In total, 94 people were accused. One of the three members of the court-martial was Georgios Papadopoulos who later (1967) became the leader of the military dictatorship of 1967-1974. Beloyannis denied all accusations and stressed the patriotic nature of his actions during the anti-Nazi resistance (1941‚Äî1944), the British intervention (1944‚Äì1946) and the Greek Civil War (1946‚Äì1949). He became globally known as the \\"Man with the Carnation\\" and as such he was depicted in a famous Pablo Picasso sketch. Beloyannis made an impassioned defense of the achievements of the resistance and exposed the fact that in the postwar years people who had fought the Nazis were persecuted for their left-wing views, while Nazi collaborators were rewarded with posts in the Greek government due to the Cold War atmosphere. Despite national and international appeals for clemency, in 15‚Äì16 November the court-martial sentenced Beloyannis and eleven of his comrades to death.rizospastis.gr, October 2001 On 1 March 1952, Beloyannis and seven others were sentenced to death. Within a week the Greek government received from all over the world hundreds of thousands telegrams against the death sentence, while an international campaign -- with the participation of personalities like Picasso, Charlie Chaplin, Jean Paul Sartre, Paul √âluard, Nazim Hikmet and others -- asked for the cancellation of the military tribune's verdict.\\"The man with the carnation\\": 64 years since the execution of communist hero Nikos Beloyannis, In Defense of Communism Four prisoners were taken from Kallithea early Sunday morning, 30 March 1952, and executed in the Goudi camp.1952: Nikos Beloyannis, the man with the carnation, Executedtoday.com; accessed 25 July 2018. The sentences of the other co- defendants of Beloyannis were commuted to life imprisonment, and by the mid-1960s all were released from prison. Beloyannis became one of the great heroes of the Greek resistance, and a symbolic victim of the authoritarian postwar establishment. His name was given to the village of Beloiannisz built in Hungary to house the Greek political refugees who lived in exile from the end of the civil war (1949) until they were allowed to return to Greece by the first Andreas Papandreou government in the early 1980s.Danforth, Loring M., and Riki van Boeschoten (2012), Children of the Greek Civil War: Refugees and the Politics of Memory.

It is managed by the Woodland Trust.There are tracts of ancient woodland within the forest, and old ditch boundaries can be found at the edges of several of the individual woods. The area has been the subject of extensive academic historical research.The Whittlewood Project An area of 400 hectares in seven different patches has been designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade 2. Extent The core of the forest is between the villages of Silverstone, Syresham, Abthorpe, Wicken and Potterspury extending south to the Northamptonshire-Buckinghamshire county boundary. Interconnecting woods, made up in part by Hazelborough Wood, make up the main section. Isolated woods such as Bucknell Wood and a scattered collection east of the village of Whittlebury, stretching east to Potterspury make up the majority of the rest. Remnants exist all around the villages and over the county boundary into Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes. Outliers include Whistley wood to the west of Syresham. Management It is managed by the Forestry Commission, who also manage neighbouring woods such as Salcey Forest and Yardley Chase. Parts of the wood are protected as an SSSI, especially a number of separate copses which represent the remnants of the old Royal Forest. . Ecology It is notable for bluebells in mid-Spring in many parts of the forest together with other ancient woodland indicator species such as Yellow rattle and the Lesser celandine. There are stands of beech and oak interspersed with hazel coppice as well as conifer plantations within the forest. The conifer plantations are slowly being removed as a part of a national policy to restore ancient woodland. They will be replaced with native hardwoods such as oak and beech. As with most ancient woods, coppicing is no longer practised, and many former coppice stools can be seen in the woods. Many types of deer can be found in the forest, including red deer and roe deer as well as Muntjac deer. Foxes and badgers are common. Birds include buzzards and there are occasional sightings of the Red kite, possibly from the expanding population in the Chilterns. The SSSI is ancient semi-natural woodlands with many trees which are mature or over-mature, especially pedunculate oaks. There are also many ash trees and a scattering of silver birches and aspens. The oaks have nationally rare and nationally uncommon beetles, and there are locally rare lichens. Access Some areas are open to the public, and footpaths go through others such as Say's Copse, but some are private land.

The British Olympic Association had been working on the bid since 1997, and presented its report to government ministers in December 2000. Following three consecutive unsuccessful UK bids to host summer Olympic Games (Birmingham for 1992 and Manchester for 1996 and 2000), the decision was made to bid with London, given the clear indication that it was the only UK city that had a chance of being selected by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) when put up against other world cities in a competitive bidding process. On 6 July 2005 at its 117th Session in Singapore, the IOC awarded London the right to host the Games of the XXX Olympiad. The city beat the favourite Paris 54 to 50 on the fourth and final ballot. London is the first city to host the Games three times. At the time of the bid, the budget projection was around ¬£2 billion, but it was later estimated that the true cost would be around ¬£9 billion. The project involved a major regeneration of the Stratford area of London, as well as improvements to surrounding services and associated venues. Public transport, an aspect of the proposal which scored poorly for the bid, saw numerous improvements, including to the London Underground and the new \\"Olympic Javelin\\" service. The celebrations of the bid's success were partly silenced the day after the announcement when the 7 July 2005 London bombings killed 52 people and injured hundreds more. There was no confirmed link between the IOC decision and the attack, which also coincided with the G8 Summit in Scotland. Following the success of the bid, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) was established to oversee the ongoing development of the games. Some alterations were made after the bid was accepted, including the decision by the IOC to eliminate some sporting events, and a new layout for the Olympic Zone, both resulting in some relatively minor changes to the Olympic venues. London 2012 banner at The Monument Sporting venues The 2012 Olympics were planned to use a mixture of newly built venues, existing facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. In the wake of the problems that plagued the Millennium Dome, the intention was that there would be no white elephants after the games. Some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others would be reduced in size and several would be relocated elsewhere in the UK. The plans would contribute to the regeneration of Stratford in east London, which would be the site of the Olympic Park, and of the neighbouring Lower Lea Valley. However, this required the compulsory purchase of some businesses and this caused controversy, with some of the business owners claiming that the compensation offered was inadequate. The purchased buildings were demolished to make way for Olympic venues and infrastructure improvements. The majority of venues were divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. Also some venues (such as those for sailing) were outside the boundaries of Greater London. The IOC noted that future negotiations were necessary to ensure the use of the Old Trafford and Villa Park football stadiums. The need for compulsory purchase orders was also highlighted as a possible problem for the Olympic Park, but IOC did not expect this to cause any \\"undue delay to construction schedules\\". At the time of the bid, 60% of the venues and facilities were in place. The remaining venues were proposed to be completed between 2007 and the start of the games. At time of the bid the following were the tentative completion dates for some of the remaining venues: Channel Tunnel/Stratford rail link (2007); Aquatics Centre and London Velopark (2008); East London line extension (2010); Olympic Stadium and Heathrow's Terminal Five final completion (2011). Olympic Zone The Olympic Zone encompasses all of the facilities within the 500-acre (2 km¬≤) Olympic Park in Stratford. This park was developed on existing waste and industrial land, at grid reference , just seven minutes by Olympic Javelin train from central London. The park contains: * The Olympic Stadium, hosting the track and field athletics events as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. * The Aquatics Centre, hosting diving, swimming and synchronised swimming. * The Water Polo Arena, hosting water polo ‚Äì the first Olympic venue dedicated to hosting the sport. * The London Velopark, including a 6,000-seat indoor velodrome for track cycling and a 6,000-seat outdoor BMX racing track. * The Riverbank Arena, with 15,000 and 5,000-seat arenas, hosting hockey. * Four indoor arenas (Olympic Park Arenas 1‚Äì4), hosting basketball (2), fencing (4), volleyball (1), handball (3), and the fencing and shooting disciplines of the modern pentathlon (2). * The London Olympic Village, with accommodation for all athletes and accredited officials (some 17,320 beds in total). After the games, the village was planned to become a district of the Stratford City development, a multi-billion-pound development project on the former railway goods yard to the east of the Olympic Park. * The Olympic Press and Broadcast Centres. * A tennis training centre. River Zone ExCel Exhibition Centre The River Zone featured five main venues in the Thames Gateway area straddling the River Thames: * The ExCeL Exhibition Centre, for boxing, fencing, judo, table tennis, taekwondo, weightlifting, and wrestling. * The Millennium Dome and Greenwich Arena, for badminton, basketball, and gymnastics. * Greenwich Park, for equestrianism. * The Royal Artillery Barracks, for shooting. Central Zone The Central Zone was formed out of all the remaining venues within Greater London. They are quite widely spread across central and west London: * The new Wembley Stadium for the football finals. * The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon for tennis. * Lord's Cricket Ground for archery. * Regent's Park for road bicycle racing. Baseball and softball were also due to be hosted in Regent's Park before it was announced in July 2005 that they would be dropped as Olympic events for the London games. * Horse Guards Parade for beach volleyball. * Hyde Park for the triathlon. Outside Greater London Three of the venues were just outside Greater London: * Weald Country Park, Essex for mountain biking * Broxbourne, Hertfordshire for canoe/kayak slalom * Dorney Lake, in Buckinghamshire, for rowing and canoe/kayak flatwater. The Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, in Portland Harbour, Dorset, on the south coast of England, would be used for the sailing events. It is around 120 miles (192 km) from central London. The earlier stages of the football competition were played at football stadia around the country including: * Hampden Park in Glasgow * Millennium Stadium in Cardiff * Old Trafford in Manchester * St James' Park in Newcastle * Ricoh Arena in Coventry * Windsor Park in Belfast Olympic Village The Olympic Village was located in Lower Lea Valley in east London. The area was then underdeveloped, and thus a well-suited place to construct the village. Because the Olympic Village is located within the Olympic Park, about 75 percent of athletes would be within 15 minutes of their venues; this compact design, according to double Olympic decathlon gold medallist Daley Thompson, would \\"make [the experience] so much more inspirating [sic] and real\\". When the games are over, the Village will be converted into new homes and facilities for the local community. Australian construction company Lend Lease Corp Ltd was chosen to build the Olympic Village. The project cost ¬£5.3 billion (A$13.2 billion) and was constructed in two phases. The first phase, which involves the development of 4,200 residential buildings and other accommodations for the village, began in 2008. When the 2012 Olympics are over, the second phase will involve the refurbishment of the Olympic village and construction on another of space to complete the regeneration of Stratford City. The Olympic Village's accommodations are the most spacious in Olympic history. Each athlete and official is guaranteed their own bed ‚Äì over 17,000 beds in total. Each apartment was billed to include Internet access and wireless networking and other state-of-the-art technology. Transport and infrastructure A London Underground train decorated to promote London's olympic bid ‚Äì this coincided with plans for investment the city's public transport network Public transport, an aspect of the bid which scored poorly in the IOC's initial evaluation, was planned to see numerous improvements, including the expansion of the London Underground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the temporary \\"Olympic Javelin\\" service. The games were won without a commitment to deliver Crossrail by 2012. This was the largest transport project proposed for London, and it was widely assumed in the early stages of the bidding process that the games could not be won without a guarantee that it would be completed before the games. The bid envisaged that 80% of athletes would be within 20 minutes of their events and 97% would be within 30 minutes of their events. It was estimated that 80% of spectators would arrive by rail. Together, all the planned heavy rail, light rail, and underground services (excluding Crossrail) were expected to deliver around 240 trains every hour. Additionally, there were to be two major park and ride sites off the M25 within 25 minutes of the Olympic Park capable of holding 12,000 cars. For the most part, predictions showed that on event days, 78% of spectators were likely to travel from within London and only 22% from the rest of the UK and Europe. Organizers hoped to use low- or no-emission vehicles to transport Olympic athletes and officials. Budget As of the time of the bid, projections for the cost of the 2012 Olympics were low. The bid team believed that London could end the Games with a surplus of more than ¬£100 million. The organising committee laid out the following figures: * ¬£560 million for new venues, including ¬£250 million for the Olympic Stadium. * ¬£650 million for the Olympic village. * ¬£1.5 billion to run the Games. * ¬£200 million on security. The revenue for the games was also projected: * ¬£1.5 billion from a special Olympic National Lottery game. * ¬£625 million from a council tax surcharge of ¬£20 per year for London households. * ¬£560 million from IOC television and marketing deals. * ¬£450 million from sponsorship and official suppliers. * ¬£300 million from ticket sales. * ¬£250 million from the London Development Agency. * ¬£60 million from licensing. While this projection seemed reasonable, many were adamant about the actual costs. In early 2007, it was suggested that the actual cost of the games could exceed ¬£9.35 billion (US$18.03 billion), well over the bid projection. For comparison, the 2004 games in Athens cost around ¬£7 billion (US$13.5 billion) and estimates for the 2008 games in Beijing run between ¬£10 billion and ¬£20 billion (US$19 billion and US$39 billion). Ticketing Approximately 8.0 million tickets were proposed to be available for the Olympics, and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympics. and the London Organising Committee planned on selling a total of 6.5 million (an 81% sellout) Olympic tickets, and a 63% sellout for Paralympic tickets. Olympic tickets go on sale on 15 March 2011London 2012 Tickets To go on Sale March 15 , worldnewsinsight.com and should remain on sale until the start of the event, depending on availability. With the purchase of a ticket, each person is entitled to free transportation on London's public transport system for that day. Paralympic tickets go on sale on 9 September 2011.Six weeks to apply for London 2012 tickets from March, moneycontrol.com, 16 January 2011 Marketing Director David Magliano said that 1.5 million tickets would be sold for ¬£15 (US$29). The average ticket price was set to be ¬£40 (US$77) and 75% of all tickets would cost less than ¬£50 (US$97), prices that Magliano says are reasonably accessible to almost everyone in Britain. In addition to stadium seats, there would be 20,000 ¬£10 (US$19) tickets for the Olympic Park to watch events on big screens. Political commitment To facilitate the Olympics at a governmental level, Cabinet-level Minister for the Olympics Tessa Jowell was set to be responsible for the games. Also in the Cabinet would be an Olympic Security Committee to co-ordinate security planning. In addition, the government proposed to create the Olympic Delivery Authority, which would oversee the construction of venues and see that the games are lived out past 2012. Other details * A tri-generation plant to supply electricity, heat and chilled water to the Olympic Park using technology which produces 33% lower CO2 emissions than from the electricity grid. * By 2012, it was estimated that over 135,000 hotel rooms would be available within 50 kilometres of the Olympic Park, up from 103,000 at the time of the bid. 40,330 rooms had been guaranteed at the time of the bid. * For the first time in any Games, live Olympic backdrop presentation facilities would be available to broadcast rights holders via rooftop studios on the main press centre with a direct view of the Olympic Stadium and Park. * The torch relay would highlight the \\"Olympic Truce\\" by passing through the countries of Nobel Peace Prize winners. Following criticism of the International Torch relay in advance of the 2008 Beijing Summer Games, this was re-designed to be a UK-wide 70-day, 8000-mile torch relay with a brief excursion to Dublin, Ireland. * The first chairman of the London Olympic Bid was airline executive Barbara Cassani. Charles Allen, Lord Coe and Alan Pascoe were appointed Vice Chairmen in September 2003. Cassani guided the group through the first submission to the IOC, but stepped down in May 2004 in favour of Lord Coe. Coe, himself an Olympic gold medal-winning athlete and former Conservative politician, enlisted the support of many current and former British Olympians, including Kelly Holmes, Steve Redgrave, and Daley Thompson. Planned legacy of the Games The organising committee paid special attention to the after effects of the games on London, and what they could do to make sure the games left a lasting impression on London and the world. The LOCOG planned out the uses of important stadiums and transportation systems after the games, as well as the social factors of the 2012 legacy. One of the most prominent of the proposed legacy is the conversion of the Olympic Village into 3,600 apartments, most of which will be affordable housing. Most of Stratford City will be regenerated with the construction of 500,000 more square metres of space. The committee outlined plans to donate the sports equipment used in the Games to sports clubs and charities in the United Kingdom. Sports venues One of the priorities governing the contents of London's bid was to avoid leaving \\"white elephants\\" after the games. To be sure that important venues and stadiums do not go to waste, the organising committee has planned what to do with them after the games. All venues that will not have a planned use after the games are over will be built as temporary venues. The 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium will be converted into a 25,000-seat multi-purpose venue to be mainly used for athletics events. The Stadium should become the hub of east London activities when the games end. The Aquatics Centre after the games will include two 50-metre pools, a 25-metre diving pool and a fitness centre. They will be able to accommodate elite, development, local club and community users. The venue will allow for 3,500 spectators and would host local, national, and worldwide swimming events. To connect a variety of cycling and walking trails throughout the Lea Valley, the London Velopark will be transformed into a multi- discipline cycling centre. It will be extended further northwards, with the legacy road cycling circuit straddling the A12 and extending into the old Eton Manor site, where the mountain biking area will be located.London 2012: Demolition work starts on Olympic Park site 14 December 2006 The transformed stadium will consist of a 3,000-seat velodrome, road track, competition and play BMX tracks, and a mountain biking course for use by all levels of cyclists. The Olympic Hockey Centre after the games will become a venue providing training and competition facilities for hockey at all levels. It will feature a 5,000 seat arena and a training pitch. In addition, several of the indoor arenas would be assembled elsewhere in the UK. The construction of the Aquatics Centre and the Velopark was confirmed before London won the Games, so it might be more accurate to call them legacies of the bid rather than of the Games. While the legacy venues would be tailored to London's ongoing needs, some of them would be expensive for that purpose. For example, London will have paid for an 80,000-seat athletics stadium, but will only possess a 25,000-seat stadium. Social and economic benefits At the time of the bid, those involved in British sport were hopeful that there would also be a 2012 legacy of increased commitment to sport in the UK, with the social and health benefits they believe that could bring, but it will be difficult to assess whether or not this really happens. Some commentators have argued that it would be better to invest directly in grass roots sport. Disability organisations including the Autism Awareness Campaign UK were confident that the Olympic and Paralympic Games would encourage people across the disability spectrum to take up sport. Other legacy items would include the conversion of the Olympic Village Polyclinic into a lifelong learning centre for the east London community with a nursery and primary and secondary schools, and the conversion of the media and press centre into a creative industries centre for east London. The organisers claimed that 3,000 new permanent jobs would be created, but opponents of the games were concerned that some of the 11,000 existing jobs in the Olympic Zone may be lost. It was also hoped that there will be a wider economic effect from the improvements which the games might make to London's image. Transport The planned transport legacy for the capital included new bus transit schemes, extensions to existing Underground lines, redevelopments of London Underground stations and upgrades to the trains used. There were also to be many upgrades to National Rail services with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, a new high-speed rail link, several new stations and upgrades to stations such as King's Cross St Pancras. Please view the Legacy Map to see the upgrades to the London Transport network in context. Opinions of the bid=Support The Head of the IOC evaluation commission praised the passion behind the London 2012 bid when they visited Stratford and other places in the city. The IOC evaluation commission chair Nawal El Moutawakel speaking at a press conference in London observed: \\"We could feel it, hear it and see it.\\" She added, \\"It was in every speech and every word.\\" 2012 was seen as a window of opportunity as observers saw Europe as the destination for the Games. Four of the five finalist cities were from Europe. Support for the bid topped 70% of the people of the United Kingdom and 68% of the people in London, as shown by an opinion poll commissioned by the IOC. Some of the support can be attributed to the city's \\"Back the Bid\\" campaign, which included the slogan on posters that were hung around London in the months leading up to the decision to award the 2012 Games to London. Many disability organisations including the Autism Awareness Campaign UK urged all people with disabilities to back the London 2012 bid. On 17 June 2005, British Prime Minister Tony Blair reiterated the Government's total commitment to London's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. Mr Blair told BBC Five Live that he would be travelling to Singapore with the London delegation to stress the \\"complete 100% support\\" of politicians from all the major political parties in the country. \\"The most important thing is to show people that the Government is absolutely behind the bid\\", said Mr Blair, who travelled to the Far East before returning to chair the 31st G8 summit at Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland. The leaders of the opposition parties also attended the meeting and expressed their support of the venture. Criticism Many Londoners challenged the high cost of the Olympics and the ¬£20 per year council tax rise to fund it as well as the possibility of white elephant sites like the Millennium Dome being left. Additionally there were concerns that unions, including the RMT, would strike near or during the proceedings for bonuses and that construction deadlines would not be met. Outside of London the success was not universally welcomed, with fears that the event would divert funding from the rest of the country and that the rest of the United Kingdom would be forced to help fund it, for no benefit. Local business ‚Äì some extant in this area for over 100 years ‚Äì were questioning the package of measures in place to allow them to find new sites when the new Olympic village displaced them. Comparison had been drawn between the Manchester bid and this one, in terms of the amount of government support, and the overwhelmingly hostile attitude of the London-based press to Manchester's bid. Furthermore the cost of travelling and accommodation would rise across London which many thought would outprice tourists and leave many events under- attended. IOC evaluation report The International Olympic Committee's evaluation report was generally very positive. It scored poorly on the transportation and public/government support aspects of the evaluation, but received a 10 in accommodations. > London has proposed Games based on providing world-class facilities and > services for the athletes, and a legacy for sport and the community.

He died of a heart attack in Spain while supervising the testing of the aborted Honda F1 project. He was married to Cherry and had two children, Ben and Amey. Early career After leaving the Royal Masonic School for Boys, Harvey Postlethwaite attended the University of Birmingham, England to study mechanical engineering and graduated, with a BSc and then a doctorate, during the 1960s. He was a keen follower of motor sport, competing in a Mallock at club level for a while. After graduation Postlethwaite joined ICI as a research scientist, but bored by this he soon began to pursue a career as a race car engineer, joining March in 1970, then aged just 26. Postlethwaite worked on the fledgling company's Formula 2 and Formula 3 cars but was lured away to join the Hesketh Formula One team who were a March customer. The Hesketh team was well known for an unconventional approach to Formula One‚ÄîPostlethwaite was himself considered 'eccentric': :\\"The Doc's explanation of his move to Hesketh was that 'They got me drunk'.\\"Gerald Donaldson James Hunt ‚Äì The Biography Collins Willow paperback edition 1995 p.105 Formula One Working to modify and improve the novice team's March 731 chassis, Postlethwaite elevated the team into serious contention and the following year designed the team's car from scratch. 'Doc' Postlethwaite's Hesketh 308 secured a number of podium positions. The following year he further developed the car's unusual rubber spring suspension and saw his creation take victory at the Dutch Grand Prix in the hands of James Hunt. By Lord Hesketh could no longer afford to run the team and sold out. Postlethwaite went with his cars to the newly founded Wolf‚ÄìWilliams Racing, headed by Walter Wolf and Frank Williams, but the results were poor and the owners soon went their separate ways. Postlethwaite remained with Wolf, designing the team's challenger, the WR1. Success was immediate with Jody Scheckter taking victory at the season's opening race. Two more wins and a number of podium results followed and Scheckter eventually finished second in the Drivers' Championship. Although Postlethwaite remained with the team until they were never to repeat their success. When Walter Wolf closed the team down at the end of 1979 he transferred, along with the Wolf cars and driver Keke Rosberg to the Fittipaldi Automotive team. He produced a new design, the F8, for the latter half of 1980 but left to join Ferrari in early 1981. At the time the Italian team were considered amongst the best engine builders in the sport, but amongst the worst chassis designers. Postlethwaite was selected personally by Enzo Ferrari to rectify this problem and by the following year everything was in place for success. The 126C2 Ferrari took the Constructors' title despite several serious setbacks, including the practice crash at Zolder which claimed the life of Gilles Villeneuve. Despite the loss of their inspirational Canadian driver, Postlethwaite's updated design, the 126C2B, took the Constructors' title again in . Postlethwaite remained with Ferrari until . After 1983 his cars took several more wins, but were unable to compete with McLaren and Williams for title victory. He was eventually replaced by John Barnard and moved to Tyrrell, where he worked for four years. During his tenure as technical director Tyrrell's results improved noticeably, culminating in the season opener in Phoenix, where Jean Alesi was able to challenge Ayrton Senna's McLaren for victory and finished second in a Tyrrell 018. Alesi repeated the feat in the Postlethwaite's novel 019 ‚Äì the first of the 'high nose' Formula One cars ‚Äì at Monaco. At the car's launch Postlethwaite proved the structural integrity of its unusual front 'gull wing' by standing on it. While at Tyrrell Postlethwaite employed Mike Gascoyne, who became his assistant and prot√©g√©. In 1991, Postlethwaite was signed as technical director of the Sauber team who planned to enter Formula One in . Taking Gascoyne with him, Postlethwaite relocated to Switzerland and designed the team's first car. Despite leaving Sauber before the start of 1993, the designer's car went on to considerable success in the hands of JJ Lehto and Karl Wendlinger regularly scoring points. Postlethwaite moved back to Tyrrell in 1994 where he remained until when the team was sold to become British American Racing. Although by the late 1980s and 1990s Tyrrell was a small, and largely uncompetitive team, the designer remained well respected within the sport and was hired as technical director of the abortive in-house Honda F1 project in 1999. Although Honda had not committed to race in Formula One the project produced an evaluation car, designed by Postlethwaite and built by Dallara, and it was during testing of this car at Barcelona in Spain that he suffered a fatal heart attack. The project was subsequently discontinued, although Honda began supplying engines again from the 2000 season onwards, eventually taking over the BAR team for 2006.

The character, who first arrived onto Albert Square in 23 April 2001 and later departed the programme on 23 December 2004, was portrayed as a bad boy who was a member of the already-established Trueman family. In his exit storyline, Paul became a drug dealer - which Beadle has been critical towards as he suggested it played into black, racial stereotyping. It was implied that Paul was killed upon his exit, though his death was not screened. During his time on the show, Paul instigates a feud with his brother Anthony (Nicholas Bailey); copes with the untimely death of their mother Audrey (Corinne Skinner-Carter); develops a close interaction with Audrey's ex-husband Patrick (Rudolph Walker), who soon turns out to be Paul's adopted father; sparks friendships with the square's local hardman Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and his nemesis Steve Owen (Martin Kemp); gets blackmailed by old acquaintance Angel Hudson (Goldie) into repaying him the money he owes and later having a relationship with the latter's estranged lover Precious (Judi Shekoni); conspire with Phil's cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) to force his enemy Trevor (Alex Ferns) into leaving Walford so his wife, Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth), would be prevented from further domestic abuse; temporarily romanced with Phil's sister Sam (Kim Medcalf); briefly date Billy's ex-girlfriend Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) until she ends up causing the death of his friend Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) on the day after they got married; support Patrick on his wedding day to his fellow shopkeeper Yolande (Angela Wynter); and end up working for Sam's gangland husband Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) that ultimately contributes to Paul's departure from the show. Storylines Paul Trueman first appeared in Walford to visit his brother Anthony (Nicholas Bailey) and their mother Audrey (Corinne Skinner-Carter) upon being estranged for them for some time. Audrey rejects him, but he decides to stay - going as far as to blackmail Anthony for money in exchange for keeping his drink-driving secret. Paul soon befriends Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), a local nightclub owner, when they begin to play poker with their neighbors. During one of Steve's poker events, however, Paul is shocked when his old acquaintance Angel Hudson (Goldie) joins the game. It quickly transpires that Paul owes Angel money, and Angel - after recognizing Paul - threatens to harm him unless he pays up. Paul tries to get the money by stealing property from his mother, pawning the goods and gambling the money he receives. This fails and he ends up with less money than he began with. When Angel comes to collect his money, Paul fails to pay, so Angel gives him a severe beating and trashes Audrey's bed and breakfast. As Angel continues to threat him, Paul blackmails Anthony into giving him the money. Anthony has no choice but to oblige; he takes out a loan and Paul pays Angel. Audrey is struck by falling debris while walking past some building works. Several days later, after an argument with Paul during which he revealed Anthony was the one who was driving at the time of the accident, Audrey collapses and dies, caused by a delayed reaction to the blow she received earlier. Just before she dies, Audrey tells Paul that she knew about Anthony being the driver and tells Paul to tell Anthony that she loves him. Paul replies \\"What about me?\\". Just as Audrey is about to say something to him, she dies. However, everything is left to Paul in Audrey's will. Paul's supposed father Patrick (Rudolph Walker) arrives in Walford for her funeral. Paul initially reacts to Patrick with apprehension but they eventually bond. Both are devastated when Anthony discovers via DNA tests that Patrick is not Paul's biological father. Paul later discovers he is the biological child of Milton Hibbert (Jeffery Kissoon), Patrick's friend with whom Audrey had been having an affair. Despite this, Patrick and Paul maintain a close relationship. Angel returns with more orders for Paul. Angel is soon to stand trial for murder and is using his wife, Precious (Judi Shekoni), as a fake alibi. He tells Paul to guard her until she could testify. Paul obliges and Precious moves to Albert Square. Paul initially does not know that Precious is Angel's wife and when she make advances towards him, he has no qualms about having sex with her. The two begin an affair, but both fear repercussions from Angel. Precious refuses to be Angel's alibi, hoping that he will be imprisoned, but he is found not guilty. Paul and Precious make plans to flee the country, but a brawl between the Truemans and the Slaters at the Queen Vic stalls their departure and Angel apprehends Precious stating that she can have her divorce however if he ever discovers she and Paul have resumed their relationship, he will kill them both. Precious has no choice but to finish with Paul and leave Walford alone. Paul is shocked when an abandoned baby is left on his doorstep. The child is the result of a one-night stand between Paul and a woman called Amy. Amy dumps her on Paul's doorstep, and he struggles to cope as a single parent. He names the baby Eleanor (Charnae Leckie), after his stepfather, Patrick's mother. As Paul starts to cope with looking after Eleanor, Amy decides she wants her back and Social Services collect her, leaving Paul heartbroken. Paul has a sexual relationship with Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks); they concoct a plan to fleece Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) of all his money. Janine professes to love Barry while all the time sleeping with Paul. Paul however attempts to stop the plan on Janine's wedding day to Barry confessing he loved her and they didn't need Barry's money but Janine refused. She marries Barry, thinking he is terminally ill so she can inherit his wealth, but the illness is a false alarm, and following the wedding, Janine confesses their marriage is a sham and pushes Barry away, repulsed; he falls down a ravine to his death. Paul suffers from immense guilt about his involvement in this. He finishes with Janine and in his guilt, makes a conscious effort to support Barry's grieving ex-wife Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). Paul develops feelings for Natalie and they begin a relationship, but he struggles with his guilt. After Natalie grows suspicious of the nature of Paul's relationship with Janine, Paul finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul had conspired with her to \\"fleece\\" Barry from the start, and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square. Paul is delighted when Janine is arrested and imprisoned for killing Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman). Paul then decides to leave Walford and join his brother travelling Europe, but returns to Albert Square to see Patrick and Yolande (Angela Wynter) marry and is persuaded to stay in Walford. Paul has a spell working with troubled youth, but begins to get involved in crime again when he starts drug dealing for Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs). After being arrested Paul informs the police about Andy's criminal dealings, which proves to be his undoing, as Andy then orders him killed. Paul considers escaping, but realises his family would be in danger if he does, so he says a tearful goodbye to Patrick, leaving in a taxi; the driver of the taxi is a hitman, sent by Andy. Paul tells Patrick he is leaving and will not be seen again. Patrick is not aware that Paul is actually leaving to get killed. Paul asks the driver to \\"make it quick\\". A month later, when Patrick wants to find Paul after he fails to get in contact with him, he discovers Paul has been killed, and identifies his corpse. He swears revenge on Andy and eventually gets his wish when Andy is killed by Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). Reception Gary Beadle was critical of his exit storyline, accusing EastEnders of racial stereotyping for turning his character into a drug dealer. He commented to The Mirror: \\"I hate the storyline, I'm really not happy about it. It's so unimaginative, full of stereotypes - black people and drugs, blah, blah, blah. Any scenes involving drugs, you can rest assured I hated filming them. I just knew Paul wouldn't do that - it's not his style. Once they started hanging my character so dramatically, I knew I'd made the right decision to leave.\\" Speaking to BBC Radio 1 in 2004, Beadle stated that the storyline had a negative effect on his private life, with public shouting at him in the street things such as 'Drug dealer' or 'Sell me some drugs'. Beadle suggested that the storyline was \\"about a very deep subject and if you are going to write about that subject then you need to explain it completely. I'm just talking about believability. You need to show the beginning, the middle and the end, otherwise it looks negative.\\" Beadle also said that he was disappointed that Paul was not shown to die on-screen - his death was implied not screened.

College of Arts & Sciences  The University of Alabama  Description  Composite image of the Earth at night in 2012, created by NASA and NOAA. The brightest areas of the Earth are the most urbanized, but not necessarily the most populous. Even more than 100 years after the invention of the electric light, some regions remain thinly populated and unlit. White spoke of culture as a general human phenomenon and claimed not to speak of ‚Äòcultures‚Äô in the plural. His theory, published in 1959 in The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome, rekindled the interest in social evolutionism and is counted prominently among the neoevolutionists. He believed that culture ‚Äì meaning the sum total of all human cultural activity on the planet ‚Äì was evolving. White differentiated between three components of culture: # Technological, # Sociological and # Ideological, and argued that it was the technological component which plays a primary role or is the primary determining factor responsible for the cultural evolution.  Argument Synopsis  White's materialist approach is evident in the following quote: \\"man as an animal species, and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechanical means of adjustment to the natural environment\\". This technological component can be described as material, mechanical, physical and chemical instruments, as well as the way people use these techniques. White‚Äôs argument on the importance of technology goes as follows:Leslie White (The United States, 1900-1975). Minnesota State University # Technology is an attempt to solve the problems of survival. # This attempt ultimately means capturing enough energy and diverting it for human needs. # Societies that capture more energy and use it more efficiently have an advantage over other societies. # Therefore, these different societies are more advanced in an evolutionary sense. For White ‚Äúthe primary function of culture‚Äù and the one that determines its level of advancement is its ability to ‚Äúharness and control energy.‚Äù White's law states that the measure by which to judge the relative degree of evolvedness of culture was the amount of energy it could capture (energy consumption). White differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use energy of domesticated animals. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to agricultural revolution here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness nuclear energy.  White's Energy Formula  White introduced a formula: : C = ET, ...where E is a measure of energy consumed per capita per year, T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy and C represents the degree of cultural development. In his own words: ‚Äúthe basic law of cultural evolution‚Äù was ‚Äúculture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased.‚Äù Therefore \\"we find that progress and development are affected by the improvement of the mechanical means with which energy is harnessed and put to work as well as by increasing the amounts of energy employed\\". Although White stops short of promising that technology is the panacea for all the problems that affect mankind, like technological utopians do, his theory treats technological factor as the most important factor in the evolution of society and is similar to the later works of Gerhard Lenski, the theory of Kardashev scale of Russian astronomer, Nikolai Kardashev and to some notions of technological singularity.

WRFD is owned by Salem Media Group and is a sister station to conservative talk outlet WTOH (98.9 FM). The two stations share studios in the northwest portion of Columbus, and WRFD's transmitter is based near Cooper Stadium on the city's west side. WRFD can also be heard via translator station W283CL (104.5 FM), which launched in November 2016. Overview WRFD is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission as a daytime-only station, and is required to sign-off at local sunset to protect WCBS in New York City, a 50,000-watt, clear-channel station on the same frequency. Despite the interruption of over-the-air service, WRFD offers programming 24 hours daily through its webstream. WRFD began broadcasting September 14, 1947, with 5 KW power and was owned and operated by Peoples Broadcasting Company, an affiliate of Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (the present-day Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company; the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation was Nationwide's founding member). WRFD was originally aimed at the regional agricultural market (hence the use of RFD, or rural free delivery), and had its studios and transmitter located on East Powell Road in rural Delaware County, north of Columbus. Nationwide Communications Corporation, later known as Nationwide Communications Corporation, a subsidiary of the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. (Note the Nationwide \\"eagle\\" logo inside the Peoples microphone logo) WRFD held a construction permit for an FM station that actually was on the air for a period of time in the early 1950s; the license was turned in for financial considerations. In 1961 WRFD re-opened a sibling FM station, WRFD-FM, which became WNCI by 1967. WRFD was later sold to Buckeye Media in 1974, which later sold it to current owner Salem Communications in late 1981. Since February 1, 1982, WRFD has operated with a Christian talk radio format. On air personalities at that time included Chuck Brown, Rick Dolezal, Boyce Lancaster, Bill DeWeese and Steve Lineberry. The station maintained a daily broadcast schedule of farm news and agribusiness information. In the late '90s, the farm program adopted the brand Ohio Farm Radio. One widely known WRFD farm broadcaster was Ed Johnson, who hosted the program from 1967 until 1972. Leaving WRFD, he founded The Agri Broadcasting Network (ABN) which he owned and operated until his death in February 2001. The longest serving Farm Director at the station during the Salem Years was Joe Cornely, who broadcast daily farm news and information until 1998, when he joined the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation staff. He was followed by Darrin Johnston, who was replaced in 2002 by Andy Vance who left Salem Communications in 2005 to found the Buckeye Ag Radio Network, and later acquire Johnson's ABN Radio. In 2005, Salem executives, with hopes of providing a more consistent programming schedule, decided to discontinue WRFD's agricultural programming. Local programming Local programming on WRFD includes Bob Burney Live on weekdays. On Saturdays, there is \\"Listen to Your Money,\\" \\"Saving Face,\\" and \\"Saturday Live,\\" hosted by Columbus radio legend Tom Wiebell.

According to the , it has a population of people. The main means of livelihood of the people is farming and fishing. The municipality's marine environment is home to various species of marine wildlife and plants, the most important of which is the giant tamilok, the largest shipworm species in the world. The species can only be found within the area, and no where else in the world, making Kalamansig an important biodiversity area. Formerly hunted by the locals, the giant tamiloks are now strictly protected by the municipality, specifically the former hunters of the species, after research confirmed the high importance of the species in the area's biodiversity.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfmNZ9Gx1OM The nearest point of entry is through Cotabato Airport, Cotabato City.

Convenient and safe public transport that plies directly to Kalamansig are also available at NCCC Mall Davao, General Santos City Public Terminal, Cotabato City Lebak-Kalamansig Terminal and Tacurong City Public Terminal. Etymology Like most municipalities in the Philippines, Kalamansig traces its name from various legendary origins. A popular folklore among the Manobos, a tribe of people who were among the earliest inhabitants of the place, explained that the name originated from a phrase ‚ÄúKulaman-su-wayeg‚Äù, which literally translates as ‚ÄúKulaman in the water‚Äù. Kulaman is said to be a famous Sultan of the Valley during the seventeenth century. According to the legend, a long famine came to the place and the Sultan, who was a loving father and provider to his family, ventured alone and gathered cassava, a staple food of the Manobos, for their consumption. Before returning home, the Sultan decided to wash the root crop in a river, but a sudden and strong river current arrived and swept the aging Sultan from his feet, carrying him downstream and was drowned in the process. His body was later found and recovered downriver, coining the word ‚ÄúKulaman-sa-ig‚Äù (Kulaman in the water). The name evolved into ‚ÄúKalamansig‚Äù which later become the official name. In honor of this Manobo tribal leader, the river where he was found was named after him and later, the entire upper valley was called ‚ÄúKulaman‚Äù. This barangay is now part of the Municipality of Sen. Ninoy Aquino. History 150-foot tower of United States forces. Build in early 1920 (US colonization period) as wireless communication station connecting Cotabato, Malabang and Lanao still stands today. The existing seat of government of Kalamansig was formerly the municipality of Lebak. The first attempt to separate was on Lebak (presently Kalamansig) was under the municipal district of Kiamba while Salaman (now Lebak) use under the district of Dinaig on August 18, 1947 under Executive Order No. 82. and it was again reunited under one independent municipality of Lebak on December 31, 1948. The seat of government was transferred to Salaman on April 12, 1951. Ten years later, the Municipality of Kalamansig formally created by the virtue of Executive Order No. 459 dated December 29, 1961 signed by Carlos P. Garcia, creating the municipality of Kalamansig from certain barangays of Lebak and Palimbang. There are 20 barangays and sitios carved out from Lebak: Lun, Pitas, Dansalan, Pedtegenan, Madu, Port Lebak, Lenek, Santa Clara, Sebayor, Nalilidan, Bosawon, Calubcub, Camp III, Poral, Limulan, Simsiman, Cadiz and Tipudos. The 8 barangays and sitios were taken from Palimbang are Sangay, Mat, Danawan, Paril, Babancao, Basiawan, Narra and North Kulaman. Kalamansig was transferred from Cotabato Province to Province of Sultan Kudarat on November 22, 1973 by Presidential Decree No. 341 by President Ferdinand Marcos. Kalamansig lies the few miles from the epicenter of the devastating 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake. In 2004, gigantic shipworms were discovered by the locals within the municipal waters. In 2017, the shipworms were formally researched on by local and international scientists. The research confirmed that the giant Kalamansig tamilok is kuphus polythalamia and is the largest species of its kind in the world. Due to the research, Kamalansig became the first and only known permanent natural habitat of the endangered species.https://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/168005-backstory- discovery-giant-shipworm-phiippineshttp://technology.inquirer.net/61394/rare- giant-shipworm-mollusks-found-philippine-waters Barangays It is politically subdivided into 15 Barangays: * Bantogon * Cadiz * Datu Ito Andong * Datu Wasay * Dumangas Nuevo * Hinalaan * Limulan * Nalilidan * Obial * Pag- asa (Sultan Gunting Mopak) * Paril * Poblacion * Sabanal * Sangay * Santa Clara ClimateDemographicsEducation=Elementary * Datu Guiabar Pilot School/DGPS (Barangay Poblacion), Kalamansig District I * Ricardo Cabaluna Memorial Elementary School/ RCMES (Barangay Sangay), Kalamansig District II * R.D.

The design was a contemporary of the British Bristol Blenheim (which was larger and designed purely as a bomber) and the German Messerschmitt Bf 110 (which was designed purely as a fighter). The Potez 630 was in use by several operators during the Second World War. Following the Battle of France, both the Vichy French Air Force and Free French Air Forces used the type; a number of captured aircraft were operated by several air wings of the Axis powers. After the end of the conflict in 1945, a handful of aircraft were used for training purposes for some time. Development=Origins On 31 October 1934, the French Ministry of Air issued a specification for a heavy fighter. The specification demanded the aircraft be capable of performing three principal roles: fighter direction, in which it was required to lead formations of single-engine fighters with sufficient maneuverability; day attack, in which the type was also to escort friendly close air support and bomber aircraft; and nightfighter operations. Specified performance details included a maximum speed of 450 km/h at 4,000 meters, a 300 km/h cruising speed, and an endurance of at least four hours. Armament requirements included two fixed forward- firing 20 mm cannons and a single machine gun to the rear for self-defence. The sought aircraft was also required to accommodate two/three seats along with a twin-engine configuration; however, some of the performance limitations imposed upon the aircraft, such as the maximum weight, served to restrict the range of suitable engines to power the type.Danel 1967, p. 4. The original Potez 630 was developed to meet this specification; two variants of the aircraft were originally submitted for consideration, one (the 630) powered by Hispano-Suiza 14AB radial engines and the other (the 631) with the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N. Other companies also produced submissions in response, including Breguet Aviation, Hanriot, Chantiers a√©ronavals √âtienne Romano, and Loire-Nieuport. Each of the competing manufacturers were requested to produce a single prototype for evaluation at their own expense; work on the first prototype, designated as the Potez 630-01, commenced in April 1935. In addition to the Potez 630, the same specification had ultimately resulted in the successful Breguet 690 series of attack aircraft. On 25 April 1936, the Potez 630-01, equipped with a pair of 580 hp Hispano-Suiza 14, conducted its maiden flight from M√©aulte, Picardy. Initially, the prototype was equipped with an experimental feature in the form of a braced horizontal stabilizer that incorporated no dihedreal. On 6 May 1936, the prototype suffered some damage due to a hard landing following the mid-air loss of a propeller blade. On 3 August 1936, after receiving repairs, the Potez 630-01 was transferred to Villacoublay Air Base, √éle-de-France; it was soon refitted with an alternative tail arrangement similar to later production aircraft and long-stroke landing gear. On 20 November 1936, flight testing of the prototype resumed; it was shortly thereafter delivered to the Centre d'Essais de Mat√©riels A√©riens (CEMA) for official tests. The original engines of the Potez 630-01 were progressively replaced with improved models of Hispano-Suiza engine, gradually increasing thrust to reach 700 hp on takeoff. At its maximum takeoff weight of 3,850 kg, the prototype was capable of a maximum speed of 460 km/h and a maximum range of 1,300 km when flown at an economical cruising speed of 300 km/h. In March 1937, the second prototype, designated Potez 630-02, performed its maiden flight from M√©aulte.Danel 1967, pp. 4‚Äì5. The Potez 631-01 was damaged after a landing with its landing gear not being locked into the down position; after repairs, it was handed over to CEMA for official trials in November 1937.Danel 1967, p. 5. Production Cutaway of the Potez 630. On 23 December 1936, the Soci√©t√© nationale des constructions a√©ronautiques du Nor (SNCAN) was officially formed, grouping together five French aircraft factories; further amalgamations into SNCAN soon took place, including Potez in early 1937. Shortly following its establishment, SNCAN received a provisional order letter for ten experimental aircraft; four of these were derived from the Potez 630, three from the Potez 631 (one being the existing 631-01 prototype), two Potez 633 light bombers and one Potez 637 aerial reconnaissance aircraft. This was promptly confirmed by a contract, under which one Potez 633 was replaced by a single Potez 637 low level ground attack aircraft. In June 1937, an order for an initial production batch of 10 two- seat and 30 three-seat Potez 631 day fighters was received, the first five of which were to be delivered by February 1938. As large-scale manufacturing of the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M engines had yet to be achieved and thus was not able to reach the desired production rate of the Potez 630, an additional order was placed for 80 aircraft powered by the alternative Hispano-Suiza engine. The first 48 aircraft to be produced were equipped with Hispano-Suiza 14AB02/03 engines, these were succeeded on later models by the improved Hispano-Suiza 14AB10/11. In December 1937, regular contracts took the place of the provisional letters; a further order for 50 Potez 633 light bombers was also received, bringing the total orders for the type to 180, including the ten prototypes that had been ordered. During the late 1930s, the Potez 630 received considerable foreign interest; in addition to France, many countries were in the process of re-equipping their air forces. One such foreign venture was the acquisition of a licence to manufacture by the Czechoslovakian aircraft firm Avia to produce a variant of the aircraft, designated as the Potez 636; none were completed prior to Czechoslovakia's annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938. In 1938, a further 50 additional Potez 631s were ordered, of which 20 were to be diverted to Finland, although they never reached that country. A number of firm foreign orders was placed with SNCAN for the type; the Republic of China ordered four Potez 631 and five Potez 633, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ordered two Potez 630 and one Potez 631, the Kingdom of Romania ordered 20 Potez 633, the Kingdom of Greece ordered 24 Potez 633, and Switzerland ordered one Potez 630 and one Potez 633. In May 1937, series production of the Potez 630 commenced. Manufacturing work on the aircraft's various sections and components was shared out across various SNCAN facilities; the fuselage and tailplanes were produced in Caudebec-en-Caux, Normandy, the wings were made at Le Havre, Normandy, and final assembly was initially performed at M√©aulte; the assembly work was later transferred to Les Mureaux.Danel 1967, pp. 5‚Äì6. In February 1938, the first production Potez 630 conducted its maiden flight; on 23 February, the French Air Force accepted their first production 630 aircraft.Danel 1967, p. 6. Early on, production of the Potez 630 was hit by considerable delays, caused by a shortage of engines, propellers, and cannons; the first batch of Potez 630s were armed with four machine guns instead of the two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza cannons. On 2 August 1938, the first Potez 631 was officially accepted. On 15 March 1938, a major re- equipment and expansion program of the French Air Force, known as Plan V, was approved. While there had been intentions to order a more capable twin-engine aircraft, these were not ready for production, thus the Potez 631 and 633 were retained for this production program, which first involved 207 twin-engined day-and-night fighters along with 449 daytime light bombers. On 25 March 1938, the order for the Potez 633 was increased to 125 bombers, which were also requested to be three-seaters. The Potez 633 orders were subsequently cancelled, ordering additional Potez 631 aircraft in their place; further orders of the Potez 631 were placed to allow for the speedy withdrawal of the troublesome Potez 630. Between January and June 1940, an average production rate of 100 aircraft per month was maintained. Design Front of a Potez 63.11 The Potez 630 was a twin engine, monoplane, fully metallic three-seater with efficient aerodynamic lines and twin tailplanes. The basic design allowed for the type to replace various obsolete aircraft in the French Air Force in a wide range of roles. The long glasshouse housed a crew of three, comprising a pilot, an observer or commander who was carried based upon mission requirements, and a rear gunner who manned a single flexible light machine gun. The Potez 637 featured a glazed gondola located beneath the fuselage for an observer to be carried in the prone position. Some variants, such as the Potez 631 and 633, had a vertical bomb bay located between the two crew members. The 630 was a relatively simple and sound design, requiring an average of 7,500 man-hours to assemble each aircraft. All members of the family (with the possible exception of the Potez 63.11) shared pleasant flying characteristics and were designed to allow for easy maintenance.Danel 1967, p. 3. As a day fighter aircraft, the performance of the Potez 631 C3 was relatively disappointing, due to a low maximum speed and inadequate rate of climb compared with contemporary fighter aircraft. As a nightfighter, lack of detection equipment drastically limited their effectivness. Later models had a heavy armament (12 machine guns for the Potez 63.11). The Potez 63 family, as with the contemporary Fairey Battle and Bristol Blenheim bombers, and like many French aircraft of the time, proved vulnerable to Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Their similarity to the Messerschmitt Bf 110, both being equipped with twin engines, twin fins and a long greenhouse canopy, is believed to have resulted in several aircraft being lost to \\"friendly fire\\". Operational service=Introduction From May 1938, production Potez 630 fighters started to be delivered; the first improved Potez 631 aircraft were received in August that year.Danel 1967, p. 6. Potez 630 and 631s, in two-seater configuration, were soon used to replace obsolete ANF Les Mureaux 113 used as night fighters, while single-seat fighter groups received a number of three seat Potez 63s to act as command aircraft, from which formations of single-seat fighters would be directed and co-ordinated by radio.Breffort and Jouineau 2005, p. 67Danel 1967, pp. 4, 6. In July 1938, the first fifteen Potez 630 aircraft participated in the Villacoublay Air Show. In May 1938, the Arm√©e de l'Air (French Air Force) placed an order for 125 Potez 633 light bombers; additional orders had also being placed by Romania and Greece for 20 and 24 Potez 633s respectively.Green 1967, p. 51. France cancelled its order for Potez 633s in the summer of 1938, but further orders for the 633 were placed by Romania (for 20 more aircraft, which had been part built under the French order), and from China, for nine. Deliveries to Romania started late in 1938, with the Greeks receiving their first aircraft in the spring of 1939. In August 1939, with the risk of war increasing the French government requisitioned 32 Potez 633s from the Greek and Romanian orders that were still in France awaiting delivery.Green 1967, pp. 52‚Äì53. By September 1938, the Potez 630 had begun to supplant the obsolete Bloch MB.200 bomber in the fighter direction role; however, the Potez 630's engines proved so troublesome in service that most units were rapidly re-equipped with the Potez 631 prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. By 1 April 1939, a total of 77 Potez 630 and 88 Potez 631 aircraft had been accepted by the French Air Force. The retirement of other obsolete French aircraft, such as the Morane-Saulnier M.S.225 and Dewoitine D.510, could be accommodated for by the increasing numbers of Potez 631s.Danel 1967, pp. 6‚Äì7. Just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, the French Air Force had 85 Potez 630s, 206 Potez 631s, 22 Potez 633s, 63 Potez 633s, and 5 Potez 63.11 aircraft.Danel 1967, p. 7. The Potez 633 aircraft that were exported to Greece and Romania saw greater service than their French counterparts despite their limited numbers. Greece had nine Potez 633s in service when Italy invaded Greece in October 1940. These were used for bombing attacks against Italian supply lines until shortage of spares forced their withdrawal. In June 1941, Romania joined Germany in the invasion of the Soviet Union. Two squadrons were equipped with the Potez 633 which were used to support the Romanian army as it advanced towards Odessa. In 1942, they were replaced by Junkers Ju 88 bombers, allowing the survivors to be transferred to the advanced training role.Green 1967, pp. 54‚Äì55. Second World War A Potez 630 captured during the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign, 1941 On 28 August 1939, the French Air Force initiated the mobilisation of its units, including those equipped with the Potez 630 series. Due to requests from French Naval Aviation some Potez 631 aircraft were soon diverted to replace their Dewoitine D.371 fighters. In February 1940, a new war plan, Plan V bis, was adopted; under this plan, nearly all Potez 630 and a number of Potez 631 aircraft were retired from front line service, with some of the 630s converted to become dual-control training aircraft. That same month, it was decided to rearm the majority of Potez 631s, replacing their original armament of one cannon and one machine gun with two cannons and four underwing machine guns for the purpose of conducting ground attack missions; however, progress on this was relatively slow.Danel 1967, pp. 7, 10. The French Air Force found a use for the Potez 633 aircraft as conversion trainers for units that had received the Breguet 691 attack aircraft. On 20 May 1940, three Potez 633s took part in a strafing mission against German troops near Arras. This was the type's only operational mission over France as two days later the aircraft was withdrawn from front-line service.Green 1967, p. 54. A small number of Potez 633 originally destined for China were commandeered by the French colonial administration in Indochina and saw limited action in the brief French-Thai War in early 1941. Parked in the open ground, a number of them were destroyed by Thai Hawk 75N strafing during air raid at Siem Reap.Joseph 2011, p. 275. Once active combat had begun, the Potez 631 had quickly proved to be an ineffectual interceptor; it was slower than some German bomber aircraft and 130 km/h slower than the Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter. Perhaps the most successful unit operating the Potez 631 was the Flottille F1C of the French Naval Air Arm; between 10‚Äì21 May 1940, aircraft of the unit shot down 12 enemy aircraft in exchange for 8 of their own losses prior to its withdrawal from active combat.Danel 1967, p. 12. At one point, the Potez 637 was the only modern aircraft equipping the Groupes de Reconnaissance (GOA), which had long been equipped with obsolete aircraft.Danel 1967, p. 10. From November 1939 onwards, the first units to convert to the Potez P.63.11 were each assigned three aircraft. By mid-January 1940, there were 43 Potez 63.11s in service with 12 GOAs.Danel 1967, pp. 10‚Äì11. By June 1940, more than 700 reconnaissance Potez 63.11 had been delivered.Danel 1967, p. 11. These aircraft encountered various fates in service: more than 220 were destroyed or abandoned. Despite the addition of extra machine gun armament, aircraft having received either six, eight, or ten machine guns, the Potez 63.11 suffered the heaviest losses of any French type. One factor contributing to the high losses was the near- complete lack of spares, rendering 70 per of all P.63.11 aircraft unserviceable even prior to the German invasion; many aircraft were destroyed on the ground by enemy bombing and strafing attacks, and entire units were wiped out without conducting a single mission. The Potez 63.11 continued in service with the air force of Vichy France and with the forces of the Free French; this led to the two opposing sides both operating the type in the North African theatre.Danel 1967, pp. 12‚Äì13. The Free French Air Force initially possessed as few as three Potez 630 aircraft, but further models were captured from the Vichy French Air Force. The Germans initially allowed several Potez 630-equipped units to continue under Vichy French control; these were typically stationed in Southern France and North Africa. In the latter theatre they frequently engaged in combat with Allied forces. By 1 November 1941, the Vichy Air Force had 22 Potez 630s, 82 Potez 631s, six Potex 637s, and 236 Potez 63.11 aircraft. Large numbers of Axis-aligned Potez 630s stationed in North Africa were destroyed by American bombers during Operation Torch; Allied 630s were also used during the operation to conduct ammunition supply missions and to respond to Luftwaffe aircraft.Danel 1967, p. 13. On 27 November 1942, German military units occupied Vichy Air Force bases and seized their aircraft: around 134 Potez 630s of several variants were taken. Of the seized aircraft, 53 were refurbished and dispatched to Romania for use as trainers and target tugs; spare engines were also reused to power a number of Luftwaffe Henschel Hs 129Bs. Production of the type was resumed under German control; significant numbers of aircraft appear to have been pressed into service by the Germans, mostly in liaison and training roles. The last three Potez 631s in service were recaptured examples; these made a final contribution following the cessation of hostilities in their use as trainer aircraft at the Centre d'Essais en Vol for the revived French Air Force.Danel 1967, pp. 13‚Äì14. Variants Unlike many contemporary French aircraft, production of the Potez aircraft was reasonably prompt and the first deliveries were effected before the end of 1938. The 63 had been designed with mass production in mind and as a result, one Potez 630 was cheaper and faster to manufacture than one Morane-Saulnier M.S.406. As production tempo increased, a number of derivatives and experimental models were also developed. Fighter variants A typical feature of the 630 and 631 was the frontal armament, which originally consisted in two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannons in gondolas under the fuselage, though sometimes one of the cannons was replaced by a MAC 1934. Later in their career, 631s received four similar light machine guns in gondolas under the outer wings, though it was theoretically possible to fit six. ;Potez 635 CN2:night fighter project was cancelled ;Potez 63.12 C3:with Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp Junior radials remained a single prototype ;Potez 670-01:Fighter prototype ;Potez 671:heavy fighters were on the assembly lines when the Germans captured the SNCAN M√©aulte factory near Albert. Prototypes ;Potez 63.01:The first prototype ;Potez 630.01:The second prototype ;Potez 630 CN.2 No.01:Night-fighter prototype ;Potez 631.01:The first Gnome-Rhone powered prototype. Trainer variants ;Potez 634:A dual control trainer aircraft derivative of the 630 was proposed, which was simply designated as ;Potez 631 Ins: (for instruction) 630 conversion with Gnome-Rh√¥ne engines ;Potez 63.16 T3:A crew trainer derivative of the 63.11 with different, larger wings. Only one prototype was built. Bomber variants ;Potez 633 B2:two-seater, light level bomber. The Potez 633 retained the fuselage, wings and engines of the 631 but the observer's position and cannon gondolas were deleted and a small bomb bay was added between the pilot and rear gunner. Front armament consisted of a single light machine gun in the nose. The bomb bay could house eight 50 kg-class or two -class bombs. There was no bombardier position, as the rear gunner was supposed to direct the bombing run through a periscopic bombsight fitted ahead of him, a disposition that proved unworkable in the field. ;Potez 633.01:The first two-seat bomber prototype flew in late 1937. The Arm√©e de l'air ordered 133 Potez 633s in 1938, but two months later decided all aircraft in the light level bomber category should be 3-manned, like the Douglas DB-7 and Bloch MB.175. The French order for 633s was converted into an order for more 631s. The 633 was however offered for export and attracted orders from Romania, China and Greece. ;Potez 632 Bp.2:One example of the dive bomber prototype was started, but completed as a 633 however with Hispano-Suiza engines. It was sold to Switzerland for evaluation. ;Potez 639 AB2:The single two-seat attack bomber prototype was converted as a standard 633. Reconnaissance variants Potez 63.11 at Aleppo, Syria, in June 1941. Dissatisfied with its strategic reconnaissance aircraft such as the troublesome Bloch MB.131, the Arm√©e de l'air required the development of a derivative of the Potez 631 for this role. ;Potez 637:Strategic reconnaissance aircraft. The observer was housed in a gondola under the fuselage; this arrangement resulted in an aircraft that retained most of the qualities of the 631. 60 examples were ordered in August 1938 and delivered. :At the same time, the Arm√©e de l'Air was desperate to re-equip its army cooperation units which had particularly antiquated equipment, but since the development of the 637, had completely changed its mind about how the observer position should be arranged. Potez was therefore required to develop a variant that, while retaining the wings, engines and tail surfaces of the 631, hosted the observer in a more conventional nose glasshouse. ;Potez 63.11:Because the pilot needed to be seated above the observer, the fuselage was taller, which resulted in reduced top speed and manoeuvrability. As a result, the 63.11 proved very vulnerable, despite being protected with some armour and basic self-sealing coating over the fuel tanks. As a secondary light bomber capability was part of the requirements (though it was rarely if ever used), the fuselage accommodated a tiny bomb bay, carrying up to eight 10 kg-class bombs. This bomb bay was replaced by an additional fuel tank on late examples. Additionally, two 50 kg- class bombs could be carried on hardpoints under the inner wings. Frontal armament was originally one, then three MAC 1934s under the nose, and many 63.11s were equipped with the same additional guns in wing gondolas as the 631s. :The first Potez 63.11 No.1 and second No.2 prototypes first flew in December 1938, and no less than 1,365 examples were on order in September 1939, of which 730 were delivered, making the 63.11 the most numerous variant of the family by far.

For example, three points are always coplanar, and if the points are distinct and non-collinear, the plane they determine is unique. However, a set of four or more distinct points will, in general, not lie in a single plane. Two lines in three-dimensional space are coplanar if there is a plane that includes them both. This occurs if the lines are parallel, or if they intersect each other. Two lines that are not coplanar are called skew lines. Distance geometry provides a solution technique for the problem of determining whether a set of points is coplanar, knowing only the distances between them. Properties in three dimensions In three- dimensional space, two linearly independent vectors with the same initial point determine a plane through that point. Their cross product is a normal vector to that plane, and any vector orthogonal to this cross product through the initial point will lie in the plane. This leads to the following coplanarity test using a scalar triple product: Four distinct points, and are coplanar if and only if, :[(x_2 - x_1) \\\\times (x_4 - x_1)] \\\\cdot (x_3 - x_1) = 0. which is also equivalent to :(x_2 - x_1) \\\\cdot [(x_4 - x_1) \\\\times (x_3 - x_1)] = 0. If three vectors and are coplanar, then if (i.e., and are orthogonal) then :(\\\\mathbf{c}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat a})\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat a} + (\\\\mathbf{c}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b})\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b} = \\\\mathbf{c}, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat a} denotes the unit vector in the direction of . That is, the vector projections of on and on add to give the original . Coplanarity of points in n dimensions whose coordinates are given Since three or fewer points are always coplanar, the problem of determining when a set of points are coplanar is generally of interest only when there are at least four points involved. In the case that there are exactly four points, several ad hoc methods can be employed, but a general method that works for any number of points uses vector methods and the property that a plane is determined by two linearly independent vectors. In an -dimensional space (), a set of points, are coplanar if and only if the matrix of their relative differences, that is, the matrix whose columns (or rows) are the vectors \\\\overrightarrow{p_0 p_1}, \\\\overrightarrow{p_0 p_2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\overrightarrow{p_0 p_{k-1}} is of rank 2 or less. For example, given four points, , and , if the matrix :\\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 - w_1 & x_2 - w_2 & \\\\dots & x_n - w_n \\\\ y_1 - w_1 & y_2 - w_2 & \\\\dots & y_n - w_n \\\\ z_1 - w_1 & z_2 - w_2 & \\\\dots & z_n - w_n \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} is of rank 2 or less, the four points are coplanar. In the special case of a plane that contains the origin, the property can be simplified in the following way: A set of points and the origin are coplanar if and only if the matrix of the coordinates of the points is of rank 2 or less. Geometric shapes A skew polygon is a polygon whose vertices are not coplanar. Such a polygon must have at least four vertices; there are no skew triangles. A polyhedron that has positive volume has vertices that are not all coplanar.

Properties * A log-concave function is also quasi-concave.

Log-concave distributions Log-concave distributions are necessary for a number of algorithms, e.g. adaptive rejection sampling. Every distribution with log-concave density is a maximum entropy probability distribution with specified mean Œº and Deviation risk measure D. As it happens, many common probability distributions are log- concave. Some examples:See *The normal distribution and multivariate normal distributions. *The exponential distribution. *The uniform distribution over any convex set. *The logistic distribution. *The extreme value distribution. *The Laplace distribution. *The chi distribution. *The hyperbolic secant distribution. *The Wishart distribution, where n >= p + 1. *The Dirichlet distribution, where all parameters are >= 1. *The gamma distribution if the shape parameter is >= 1. *The chi-square distribution if the number of degrees of freedom is >= 2. *The beta distribution if both shape parameters are >= 1. *The Weibull distribution if the shape parameter is >= 1. Note that all of the parameter restrictions have the same basic source: The exponent of non- negative quantity must be non-negative in order for the function to be log- concave. The following distributions are non-log-concave for all parameters: *The Student's t-distribution. *The Cauchy distribution. *The Pareto distribution. *The log-normal distribution. *The F-distribution. Note that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of all log-concave distributions is also log-concave. However, some non-log-concave distributions also have log- concave CDF's: *The log-normal distribution. *The Pareto distribution. *The Weibull distribution when the shape parameter < 1\\\\. *The gamma distribution when the shape parameter < 1\\\\. The following are among the properties of log- concave distributions: *If a density is log-concave, so is its cumulative distribution function (CDF). *If a multivariate density is log-concave, so is the marginal density over any subset of variables. *The sum of two independent log-concave random variables is log-concave. This follows from the fact that the convolution of two log-concave functions is log-concave. *The product of two log-concave functions is log-concave. This means that joint densities formed by multiplying two probability densities (e.g. the normal-gamma distribution, which always has a shape parameter >= 1) will be log-concave. This property is heavily used in general-purpose Gibbs sampling programs such as BUGS and JAGS, which are thereby able to use adaptive rejection sampling over a wide variety of conditional distributions derived from the product of other distributions.

The ergosphere is a region located outside a rotating black hole's outer event horizon. Its name was proposed by Remo Ruffini and John Archibald Wheeler during the Les Houches lectures in 1971 and is derived from the Greek word (ergon), which means \\"work\\". It received this name because it is theoretically possible to extract energy and mass from this region. The ergosphere touches the event horizon at the poles of a rotating black hole and extends to a greater radius at the equator. A black hole with modest angular momentum has an ergosphere with a shape approximated by an oblate spheroid, while faster spins produce a more pumpkin-shaped ergosphere. The equatorial (maximal) radius of an ergosphere is the Schwarzschild radius, the radius of a non-rotating black hole. The polar (minimal) radius is also the polar (minimal) radius of the event horizon which can be as little as half the Schwarzschild radius for a maximally rotating black hole. Rotation As a black hole rotates, it twists spacetime in the direction of the rotation at a speed that decreases with distance from the event horizon.Misner 1973, p. 879. This process is known as the Lense‚ÄìThirring effect or frame-dragging. Because of this dragging effect, an object within the ergosphere cannot appear stationary with respect to an outside observer at a great distance unless that object were to move at faster than the speed of light (an impossibility) with respect to the local spacetime. The speed necessary for such an object to appear stationary decreases at points further out from the event horizon, until at some distance the required speed is that of the speed of light. The set of all such points defines the ergosphere surface, called ergosurface. The outer surface of the ergosphere is called the static surface or static limit. This is because world lines change from being time-like outside the static limit to being space-like inside it.Misner 1973, p. 879. It is the speed of light that arbitrarily defines the ergosphere surface. Such a surface would appear as an oblate that is coincident with the event horizon at the pole of rotation, but at a greater distance from the event horizon at the equator. Outside this surface, space is still dragged, but at a lesser rate. Radial pull Animation: A test particle approaching the ergosphere in the retrograde direction is forced to change its direction of motion (in Boyer‚ÄìLindquist coordinates). A suspended plumb, held stationary outside the ergosphere, will experience an infinite/diverging radial pull as it approaches the static limit. At some point it will start to fall, resulting in a gravitomagnetically induced spinward motion. An implication of this dragging of space is the existence of negative energies within the ergosphere. Since the ergosphere is outside the event horizon, it is still possible for objects that enter that region with sufficient velocity to escape from the gravitational pull of the black hole. An object can gain energy by entering the black hole's rotation and then escaping from it, thus taking some of the black hole's energy with it (making the maneuver similar to the exploitation of the Oberth effect around \\"normal\\" space objects). This process of removing energy from a rotating black hole was proposed by the mathematician Roger Penrose in 1969 and is called the Penrose process. The maximal amount of energy gain possible for a single particle via this process is 20.7% in terms of its mass equivalence,Chandrasekhar, p. 369. and if this process is repeated by the same mass, the theoretical maximal energy gain approaches 29% of its original mass-energy equivalent.Carroll, p. 271. As this energy is removed, the black hole loses angular momentum, the limit of zero rotation is approached as spacetime dragging is reduced. In the limit, the ergosphere no longer exists. This process is considered a possible explanation for a source of energy of such energetic phenomena as gamma ray bursts. Results from computer models show that the Penrose process is capable of producing the high-energy particles that are observed being emitted from quasars and other active galactic nuclei. Ergosphere size The size of the ergosphere, the distance between the ergosurface and the event horizon, is not necessarily proportional to the radius of the event horizon, but rather to the black hole's gravity and its angular momentum. A point at the poles does not move, and thus has no angular momentum, while at the equator a point would have its greatest angular momentum. This variation of angular momentum that extends from the poles to the equator is what gives the ergosphere its oblate shape. As the mass of the black hole or its rotation speed increases, the size of the ergosphere increases as well.

He was a Senator for the Administrative Panel from 2002 and 2007. Early life Born in Carrigart, County Donegal, in 1971. McHugh was educated at Umlagh National School and the Loreto Convent, Milford. He attended the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, where he received an honours degree in economics and sociology, and a higher diploma in education. A keen sportsman, McHugh has been a member of the Carrigart Boxing Club, has played soccer in the Donegal League with Cranford F.C. and Bonagee United F.C., and has also been a Gaelic footballer. McHugh taught geography and mathematics at the Loreto Convent Secondary School, Letterkenny, from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996, he taught A-level economics in Dubai, during which time he helped establish the first GAA club in the United Arab Emirates. In 1996, he returned to Ireland and became a youth worker in the Ballyboe area of Letterkenny. Political career=Donegal County Council Brought into Fine Gael by Eddie McGinley from Kilmacrennan, McHugh won a seat in the Milford local electoral area on 11 June 1999. In 2001, he introduced a motion to establish a youth council for the county, which led to the formation of the Donegal Youth Council, the first democratically elected youth forum in Ireland. He also worked closely with Young Fine Gael, helping to establish the first branch in the county in March 2004. While a member of the council, he was appointed chairman of the cross-border body ERNACT (European Region Network for the Application of Communications Technology), where he made the provision of broadband in border areas a priority. Seanad √âireann He was elected to Seanad √âireann as a Senator for the Administrative Panel in 2002, where he served as Fine Gael Spokesperson on Community, Rural, Gaeltacht and Marine Affairs. McHugh set up a full-time constituency office in Letterkenny. When he was selected as the D√°il candidate for Donegal North-East, he moved into a new constituency office, which was officially opened by Fine Gael party leader Enda Kenny on 6 October 2006. D√°il √âireann McHugh topped the poll Donegal North-East at the 2007 general election with 22.6% of the first preference vote. His wife Olwyn Enright also won re-election to the D√°il, making them the third married couple to sit in the same D√°il.Michael O'Higgins and Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins both served in the 16th D√°il, 17th D√°il and 18th D√°il, and Alexis FitzGerald Jnr and Mary Flaherty both served as members in the 23rd D√°il. McHugh was appointed party deputy Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach, with special responsibility for North-South Co-operation in October 2007. McHugh was re-elected to the D√°il at the 2011 general election, attaining 19.3% of the first-preference vote. In January 2011, McHugh called for a monument, funded by the government, in Donegal, dedicated to the founding of the Ulster Volunteer Force in 1912. McHugh was criticised by Eileen Doherty, a sister of Donegal County Councillor Eddie Fullerton, who was assassinated by loyalists in 1991. Doherty claimed McHugh and other Fine Gael councillors in Donegal had snubbed a number of commemorative events and opposed the building of a monument in Fullerton's memory in Buncrana. Fullerton was the third elected official in the Republic of Ireland to be assassinated. In Manchester in October 2011, McHugh became the first Fine Gael TD to address delegates from the British Conservative Party. He described it as an \\"opportunity.\\" On 15 July 2014, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, with responsibility for Gaeltacht Affairs and Natural Resources. His appointment was met with criticism as his knowledge of the Irish language was at a basic level, although he subsequently received praise for his efforts to improve his language skills to the point where he could conduct lengthy interviews in the language. RT√â Radio 1 created the radio documentary Fine Gaeilgeoir, narrated and produced by M√°ire Treasa N√≠ Cheallaigh, following McHugh's efforts to improve his Irish over the course of a year. The appointment of a non-Irish speaker to a Gaeltacht ministry has since become known as a \\"Joe McHugh moment\\", with Shane Ross having written of having his own in May 2016. In February 2016, McHugh was heavily criticised for allocating 93% of Gaeltacht grants to the Donegal Gaeltacht, which is located in and beside his constituency. This revelation led to calls for McHugh to appear before the D√°il Public Accounts Committee to explain such a disproportionate allocation of funding. McHugh subsequently denied the claims.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/joe-mchugh-defends- approving-theatre-grant-against-advice-1.2603338 At the 2016 general election, McHugh was elected to the new five-seater Donegal constituency on the 11th count.

Holley, on the far left Robert William Holley (January 28, 1922 ‚Äì February 11, 1993) was an American biochemist. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 (with Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall Warren Nirenberg) for describing the structure of alanine transfer RNA, linking DNA and protein synthesis. Holley was born in Urbana, Illinois, and graduated from Urbana High School in 1938. He went on to study chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in 1942 and commencing his PhD studies in organic chemistry at Cornell University. During World War II Holley spent two years working under Professor Vincent du Vigneaud at Cornell University Medical College, where he was involved in the first chemical synthesis of penicillin. Holley completed his PhD studies in 1947. Following his graduate studies Holley remained associated with Cornell. He became an Assistant Professor of organic chemistry in 1948, and was appointed as Professor of Biochemistry in 1962. He began his research on RNA after spending a year's sabbatical (1955‚Äì1956) studying with James F. Bonner at the California Institute of Technology. Holley's research on RNA focused first on isolating transfer RNA (tRNA), and later on determining the sequence and structure of alanine tRNA, the molecule that incorporates the amino acid alanine into proteins. Holley's team of researchers determined the tRNA's structure by using two ribonucleases to split the tRNA molecule into pieces. Each enzyme split the molecule at location points for specific nucleotides. By a process of \\"puzzling out\\" the structure of the pieces split by the two different enzymes, then comparing the pieces from both enzyme splits, the team eventually determined the entire structure of the molecule. The structure was completed in 1964, and was a key discovery in explaining the synthesis of proteins from messenger RNA. It was also the first nucleotide sequence of a ribonucleic acid ever determined. Holley was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for this discovery, and Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall W. Nirenberg were also awarded the prize that year for contributions to the understanding of protein synthesis. Using the Holley team's method, other scientists determined the structures of the remaining tRNA's. A few years later the method was modified to help track the sequence of nucleotides in various bacterial, plant, and human viruses. In 1968 Holley became a resident fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California.

Part of the Chilean and Argentine Andean Volcanic Belt (AVB), it is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the various segments of the AVB. This part of the Andean volcanic arc begins in Peru and runs first through Bolivia and Chile, and then through Argentina and Chile, and contains about 44 active volcanoes. Socompa lies close to the pass of the same name, where the Salta- Antofagasta railway crosses the border. Socompa is known for its large debris avalanche, which was formed 7,200 years ago when most of the northwestern slope collapsed and slid down, forming an extensive deposit. It was at first considered to be either a moraine or a nuee ardende deposit, until the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens prompted awareness of the instability of volcanic edifices and the existence of large scale collapses on them. The Socompa collapse is among the largest known with a volume of and covers a surface area of , and its features are well preserved by the arid climate. Notable are the large toreva blocks which were left behind within the collapse crater. After the landslide, the volcano was rebuilt by the effusion of lava flows and much of the scar is now filled in. Socompa is also noteworthy for the high-altitude biotic communities that are bound to fumaroles on the mountain and form well above the regular vegetation in the region. The climate on the mountain is cold and dry.  Geography and geomorphology  Socompa is situated on the border between Argentina and Chile, due east of Monturaqui. The Salta‚ÄìAntofagasta railway crosses the border between the two countries just below Socompa, rendering the volcano easily accessible despite its remote location. The same pass was an important route between the two countries and reportedly between 1940 and 1970 the Carabineros de Chile had a post there. Rails and roads at Socompa go up to an elevation of ; from there the volcano can be climbed from its southern, eastern and northern flank. The mountain is considered to be an apu by the local population, and constructions have been reported either from its slopes or from its summit. The volcano is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the four volcanic zones of the Andean Volcanic Belt. The Central Volcanic Zone spans Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and contains about 44 active volcanoes, plus a number of monogenetic volcanoes and silicic caldera volcanoes. A number of older inactive volcanoes are well preserved owing to the dry climate of the region. Many of these systems are in remote regions and thus are poorly studied but pose little threat to humans. The largest historical eruption in the Central Volcanic Zone occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina in Peru, and the recently most active volcano is Lascar in Chile. Socompa is a high composite volcano consisting of a central cone and several lava domes; it is the most voluminous conical volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone. Several dacitic lava flows form the summit area of the volcano, the youngest of which originates in a summit dome. This summit dome is capped off by a summit crater at an altitude of , and four additional craters occur northeast of the summit at altitudes of . Northwest of the summit, a dacitic lava dome is the source of a high talus slope. The summit area is surrounded by an inwards-dropping scarp that opens to the northwest and whose southern margin is buried by lava flows. Pyroclastic flows crop out beneath lava flows in the northwestern segment of the volcano, within the scarp. On the southern and eastern side the scarp is long and high, while the southern side is about long. A large wedge-shaped scar is recognizable on the northwestern flank, delimited by prominent scarps running through the western and northern flanks of the edifice. The existence of a lake in the summit area within the scarps at elevations of has been reported. On the northeastern flank a pumice deposit is clearly visible. Lava domes are recognizable in the southern and western slopes, while lava flows appear mainly on the eastern and northern slopes. The whole edifice has a diameter of and, like many Central Andes volcanoes, probably originally consisted of lava domes, lava flows and various pyroclastic formations. The volcano apparently developed within a northwest- striking valley, the southern part of which now contains Laguna Socompa. This lake lies at an elevation of ; to the north the volcano is bordered by the high Monturaqui basin. A water table exists at depths of , but surface runoff is only ephemeral. Sector collapse Socompa suffered a major sector collapse during the Holocene, forming one of the largest terrestrial collapse deposits. The deposit left by the collapse was first discovered on aerial photography in 1978 but the correct interpretation as a landslide occurred in 1985; at first it was interpreted as a form of moraine, then as a large pyroclastic flow and the collapse scar as a caldera. The collapse removed about 70¬∞ (about ) of Socompa's circumference on its northwestern side, descended over a vertical distance of about and redeposited it over distances of over , at a modelled speed of . As it descended, the collapse landslide accumulated sufficient energy that it was able to override topographic obstacles and climb an elevation of about ; secondary landslides occurred on the principal deposit and there is evidence that the landslide was reflected back from its margins. The collapse occurred in several steps, with the first parts to fail ending up at the largest distances from the volcano; it is not established whether the collapse happened in a single event or as several separate failures. The total volume of material removed was about , which was dilated as it flowed and eventually ended up as a deposit with a volume of ; thorough mixing of the avalanche material occurred as the landslide progressed. The summit of the volcano was cut by the collapse and some lava domes embedded within the volcano were exposed in the rim of the collapse amphitheatre; before the collapse the volcano was about high. The collapse scar was partly filled by blocks left over by the collapse. The walls of the amphitheatre were about high, so high that secondary landslides occurred. The largest of these detached from a dome northwest of the summit and descended a horizontal distance of , forming a landslide structure notable in its own right and covering about . The central section of the collapse amphitheatre was not a simple collapse structure, but instead contained a secondary scarp. At the mouth of the collapse scar, the walls were lower, about . After the principal collapse, lava flows and pyroclastic flows ‚Äì some of which emerge from the western rim of the collapse scar ‚Äì filled up the scar left by the collapse. A similar collapse was observed in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. In fact, the occurrence of a large landslide at Mount St. Helens probably aided in the subsequent identification of the Socompa deposit as a landslide remnant. Other volcanoes have suffered from large scale collapses as well; this includes Aucanquilcha, Lastarria and Llullaillaco. In the case of Socompa, the occurrence of the collapse was probably influenced by a northwest tilt of the basement the volcano was constructed on; it caused the volcano to slide downward in its northwestern sector and made it prone to a collapse in that direction. The collapse happened about 7,000 years ago, with a date of 7,200 years before present indicated by radiocarbon dating on the deposit; it was not witnessed in historical records. This age and the age of similar collapses on Parinacota volcano also in Chile and Mount Meru in Africa coincide with the 8.2 kiloyear event; volcanic sector collapses often occur just after glacial maxima, suggesting climatic influence on the occurrence of mass failures of volcanoes. This event probably lasted only 12 minutes based on simulations. There is evidence in the collapse deposit that a lava flow was being erupted on the volcano when the landslide occurred, which together with the presence of pyroclastic fallout on the southwestern side of Socompa implies the collapse may have been started by volcanic activity. The quantity of water in the edifice rocks on the other hand was probably minor. Another theory assumes that the volcanic edifice was destabilized by ductile and mechanically weak layers beneath Socompa; under the weight of the volcano these layers can deform and \\"flow\\" outward from the edifice, causing the formation of thrusts at its foot. Evidence of such spreading of the basement under Socompa has been found. The collapse generated a large amount of energy, about . Some evidence in the form of tephra suggests that the collapse was accompanied by a lateral blast, but other research found no such evidence. Such sector collapse events are catastrophic phenomena, and the debris avalanches associated with them can reach large distances from the original volcano. The fragmentation of rocks during the landslide and the fine material generated during this process might enhance the fluidity of the avalanche, allowing it to extend far away from the source. = Landslide deposit = alt=A number of tongue-like protrusions expand radially from a central point The collapse deposit covers a surface area of , and is thus not as large as the deposit left by the Mount Shasta collapse or by the Nevado de Colima collapse. It forms the Negros de Aras surface northwest of the volcano and the El Cenizal surface due north where it has a hook-like surface distribution; the name \\"Negros de Aras\\" was given to the deposit before it was known that it had been formed by a landslide. The thickness of the deposit varies, with thin segments in the extreme southeastern and southwestern parts being less than thick and the central parts reaching . The deposit spreads to a maximum width of and is bounded by levees higher than , which are less prominent on the eastern side. As later parts of the collapse overrode the earlier segments, they formed a northeast-trending scarp in the deposit, across which there is a striking difference in the surface morphology of the collapse. The landslide deposit has been stratigraphically subdivided into two units, the Monturaqui unit and the El Cenizal unit. The first unit forms most of the surface and consists itself of several subunits, one of which includes basement rocks that were integrated into the collapse as it occurred. Likewise, the El Cenizal unit included basement rocks as well, such as playa deposits. The amount of basement material is noticeably large and might form as much as 80% of the landslide volume; the topography of the northwestern side of the volcano may have prevented the mass failure from being localized along the basement- edifice surface area, explaining the large volume of basement involved. Further, the basement-derived material was probably mechanically weak and thus allowed the landslide to move over shallow slopes. This basement material forms part of the white surfaces in the landslide deposit; other bright areas are formed by fumarolically altered material. The basement material was originally considered to be pumice. The landslide deposit contains large blocks, so called toreva blocks, which were torn from the mountain and came to a standstill unmodified, forming ridges up to several high; the largest such blocks are long and wide and their total volume is about . These blocks form an almost closed semicircle at the mouth of the collapse amphitheatre and in part retain the previous stratigraphy of the volcano. Such toreva blocks are far more frequent in submarine landslides than subaerial ones and their occurrence at Socompa may reflect the relatively non-explosive nature of the collapse and material properties of the collapsed mass. Aside from the toreva blocks, individual blocks with sizes of up to occur in the deposit and form large boulder fields. In addition to the blocks, the surface of the landslide deposit contains hummock-like hills and small topographic depressions. Part of the landslide deposit was later covered by pyroclastic flows, and this covered area is known as the Campo Amarillo. As it descended, the landslide deposit filled a shallow valley that previously existed northwest of the volcano, as well as a larger northeast-striking depression. A lava flow was rafted on the avalanche to the El Cenizal area and ended up there almost unmodified. The collapse deposit is well preserved by the arid climate, among the best preserved such deposits in the world. However, because of its sheer size its structure and stratigraphy were only appreciated with the help of remote sensing. Pleistocene lava flows and a northwest-striking drainage were buried by the landslide but can still be discerned from aerial imagery; apart from these and some hills most of the area covered by the landslide was relatively flat. At La Flexura, part of the basement beneath the avalanche crops out from the ground.  Geology  Socompa as seen from nearby railway station Socompa  Regional  Volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench at a rate of . It does not cause volcanism among the entire length of the trench; where the slab is subducting beneath the South America Plate at a shallow angle there is no recent volcanic activity. The style of subduction has changed over time. About 27 million years ago, the Farallon Plate which hitherto had been subducting beneath South America broke up and the pace of subduction increased, causing increased volcanism. Around the same time, after the Eocene, the subduction angle increased beneath the Altiplano and caused the development of this plateau either from magmatic underplating and/or from crustal shortening; eventually the crust there became much thicker.  Local  El Negrillar volcano just north of Socompa; the white area to the right is part of the Socompa landslide deposit Socompa forms a northeast-trending alignment with neighbouring volcanoes such as Pular and Pajonales, which reach elevations of about . Monogenetic volcanoes were active in the area as well during the Pliocene and Quaternary and generated lava flows. One of these centres is El Negrillar just north of the collapse deposit, which was active during the Pleistocene and formed andesite-basaltic andesite lavas unlike the eruption products of Socompa itself. A long lineament known as the Socompa Lineament is associated with the volcano. Other volcanoes such as Cordon de Puntas Negras and the rim of the large La Pacana caldera farther north are also influenced by this lineament. To the west Socompa is bordered by the Sierra de Alameida (or Almeida), which farther north merges into the Cordon de Lila. To the east the high Sal√≠n volcano neighbours Socompa; other volcanoes in the area are the high Cerro Bayo and the high Socompa Cairis, all of which show evidence of glacial activity unlike the younger Socompa.  Basement  A spaceborne image of the region northwest of Socompa, which is recognizable in the lower right tip The basement at Socompa is formed by Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations and by Quaternary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The former crop out in the Sierra de Alameida and Alto del Inca west of Socompa and the latter as the thick Quebrada Salin Beds east of the volcano. Part of these beds were taken up into the avalanche as it collapsed and form the Flexura inliner, others appear in the Loma del Inca area north and the Monturaqui area due west of Socompa. The basement rocks are subdivided into three named formations, the Purilactus Formation of Paleozoic-Mesozoic age, the San Pedro and Tambores formations of Oligocene-Miocene age and the Miocene-Pliocene Salin formation; part of the latter formation may have been erupted by Socompa itself. The volcano is situated at the point where the Sierra de Alameida meets the Puna block. During the Pliocene this basement was covered by the Arenosa and Tucucaro ignimbrites (2.5 and 3.2 million years ago by potassium-argon dating, respectively) which also crop out west of Socompa; Socompa is probably constructed on top of these ignimbrites. The Arenosa ignimbrite is about thick while the Tucucaro reaches a thickness of . Some normal faults appear in the area north of Socompa and appear to run through the edifice. While they are not visible in the edifice itself, Socompa was uplifted on its southeastern side by the fault motion. This might have aided in the onset of edifice instability and the collapse event. In addition, directly north-northwest of Socompa lie three anticlines probably formed under the influence of the mass of both Socompa and Pajonales: The Loma del Inca, Loma Alta and La Flexura.  Composition  Socompa has erupted andesite and dacite, with dacite dominating. Phenocrysts found in the rocks of the avalanche include the minerals augite, hornblende, hypersthene, magnetite and plagioclase; dacites also contain biotite while andesites also contain olivine. In the summit area, clay, silt and sulfur bearing rocks are also found.  Climate and ecology  There are few data on climate at Socompa. The area is windy and dry given that the volcano lies in the Desert Puna, with frequent snow cover and penitentes but no glaciers. The relatively low cloud cover means that insolation is high. Weather data collected in 1991 found an average temperature of , a large diurnal air temperature cycle (and a larger soil temperature cycle of ) and low evaporation. The present-day precipitation has been estimated to be , with other estimates assuming less than . Periglacial landforms indicate that in the past the area was wetter, possibly thanks to the Little Ice Age. There is however no evidence for Pleistocene glaciation including no cirques, which may be due to the volcano's young age. Socompa features autotrophic communities associated with fumaroles and thermal anomalies at high altitude, between of elevation. The autotrophic communities on Socompa are the highest known in the world, and they occur both on the actual fumaroles and on \\"cold fumaroles\\". The various species are often extremophiles since the environment on Socompa is harsh, and the communities also include heterotrophic species. Such heterotrophs include ascomycota and basidiomycota, the latter of which have noticeable similarity to Antarctic basidiomycota. The fumaroles on Socompa also feature stands of bryophytes such as liverworts and mosses as well as lichens and algae, and animals have been found in the stands. These stands are among the highest in the world and cover noticeably large surface areas despite their elevation, and are fairly remote from other plant life in the region. There is a noticeable diversity between separate stands, and the vegetation is quite dissimilar to the vegetation in the surroundings but resembles that found in the paramo and cloud forests in South America and the subantarctic islands. A sparse vegetation cover is also found on the lower slopes of Socompa.  Eruptive history  alt=A mountain featuring various white and brown lobes descending its slopes rises above a building complex Activity at Socompa commenced with the extrusion of andesites, which were followed later by dacites. Several Plinian eruptions have occurred on Socompa. Several dates have been obtained on Socompa rocks, including 2,000,000 ¬± 1,000,000, 1,300,000 ¬± 500,000, 800,000 ¬± 300,000 and less than 500,000 years ago. After the sector collapse 7,200 years ago, activity continued filling the collapse scar. The explosion craters on the summit are the youngest volcanic landforms on Socompa, there are no dates available for the lava domes and flows within the collapse scar. The youngest eruption was dated to have occurred 5,250 years before present. The absence of moraines on Socompa suggests that volcanic activity occurred during the post-glacial time. The volcano also has a young appearance, similar to historically active Andean volcanoes such as San Pedro, implying recent volcanic activity. There is no evidence for historical activity at Socompa and the volcano is not considered an active volcano, but both fumarolic activity and the emission of have been observed. The fumarolic activity occurs at at least six sites and is relatively weak; anecdotal reports indicate a smell of sulfur on the summit. Groundwater is warmer and richer in the closer to Socompa it is pumped, also suggesting that volcanic gas fluxes still occur at the volcano and that the volcano influences groundwater systems. Hot springs are found at Laguna Socompa as well. In 2011, the Chilean mining company Escondida Mining was considering building a geothermal power plant on Socompa to supply energy; the Argentine Servicio Geol√≥gico Minero agency started exploration work in January 2018 for geothermal power production.

He wrote some satirical prose, now lost, and he wrote some sensual poetry, of which 134 epigrams survive. He also compiled numerous epigrams from diverse poets in an anthology known as the Garland, and although this does not survive, it is the original basis for the Greek Anthology. Life He was the son of Eucrates, born in the city of Gadara, now Umm Qais in Jordan, which was then a partially Hellenized community that was noted for its \\"remarkable contribution to Greek culture\\". He was educated in Tyre and spent his later life in Cos where he died at an advanced age (est. 70 years old). According to short autobiographical poems he wrote, Meleager was proud of his hometown and identified himself as cosmopolitan, being both \\"Attic\\" (i.e. Hellenistic) and Syrian, and also praised Tyre for having \\"made [him] a man\\" and Kos for taking \\"care of [him] in [his] old age\\". The scholiast to the Palatine manuscript of the Greek Anthology says he flourished in the reign of Seleucus VI Epiphanes (95 - 93 BC). The uppermost date of his compilation of the Anthology is 60 BC, as it did not include Philodemus of Gadara, though later editors added thirty- four epigrams. Some writers classed him among the Cynics,Athenaeus, Deipnosophists iv. 157. See also Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 99, who classes Meleager with Menippus. and according to historian Benjamin Isaac Meleager's belief that \\"all men are equal and compatriots\\" strengthens this view, as some Cynics already held such a world view possibly as early as the 5th century BC. Like his compatriot Menippus, Meleager wrote what were known as spoudogeloia (Greek singular: ), satirical prose essays putting philosophy in popular form with humorous illustrations. These are completely lost. Meleager's fame is securely founded on the one hundred and thirty-four epigrams of his own which he included in his Anthology. The manuscripts of the Greek Anthology are the sole source of these epigrams.Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology J.W. Mackail, editor. Longmans, Green & Co., 1890 The Garland of Meleager Meleager is famous for his anthology of poetry entitled The Garland (). Polemon of Ilium and others had created collections of monumental inscriptions, or of poems on particular subjects earlier, but Meleager first did so comprehensively. He collected epigrams by forty-six Greek poets, from every lyric period up to his own. His title referred to the commonplace comparison of small beautiful poems to flowers, and in the introduction to his work, he attached the names of various flowers, shrubs, and herbs ‚Äî as emblems ‚Äî to the names of the several poets. The Garland itself has survived only as one of the original constituent roots to the Anthologia Graeca. Poetry Meleager's poetry is concerned with personal experience and emotions, frequently with love and its discontents. He typically describes himself not as an active and engaged lover, but as one struck by the beauty of a woman or boy. The following is an example:Greek Anthology, xii. 127, from Peter Jay, (1974), The Greek Anthology and Other Ancient Greek Epigrams, page 142. :At 12 o'clock in the afternoon ::In the middle of the street ‚Äì :::Alexis! :Summer had all but brought the fruit ::To its perilous end: :::And the summer sun and that boy's look :Did their work on me!

When 90¬∞ < Œ∏ ‚â§ 180¬∞, a1 has an opposite direction with respect to b. The vector projection of a vector a on (or onto) a nonzero vector b, sometimes denoted \\\\operatorname{proj}_{\\\\mathbf{b}} \\\\mathbf{a} (also known as the vector component or vector resolution of a in the direction of b), is the orthogonal projection of a onto a straight line parallel to b. It is a vector parallel to b, defined as: \\\\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b}\\\\, where a_1 is a scalar, called the scalar projection of a onto b, and bÃÇ is the unit vector in the direction of b. In turn, the scalar projection is defined as: a_1 = \\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\rightcos\\\\theta = \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b} = \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{b}}{\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\}\\\\, where the operator ‚ãÖ denotes a dot product, ‚Äña‚Äñ is the length of a, and Œ∏ is the angle between a and b. The scalar projection is equal to the length of the vector projection, with a minus sign if the direction of the projection is opposite to the direction of b. The vector component or vector resolute of a perpendicular to b, sometimes also called the vector rejection of a from b (denoted \\\\operatorname{oproj}_{\\\\mathbf{b}} \\\\mathbf{a}), is the orthogonal projection of a onto the plane (or, in general, hyperplane) orthogonal to b. Both the projection a1 and rejection a2 of a vector a are vectors, and their sum is equal to a, which implies that the rejection is given by: \\\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{a}_1. Notation Typically, a vector projection is denoted in a bold font (e.g. a1), and the corresponding scalar projection with normal font (e.g. a1). In some cases, especially in handwriting, the vector projection is also denoted using a diacritic above or below the letter (e.g., \\\\vec{a}_1 or _a_ 1; see below for more details). The vector projection of a on b and the corresponding rejection are sometimes denoted by a‚à•b and a‚ä•b, respectively. Definitions based on angle Œ∏=Scalar projection The scalar projection of a on b is a scalar equal to a_1 = \\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\cos \\\\theta , where Œ∏ is the angle between a and b. A scalar projection can be used as a scale factor to compute the corresponding vector projection. Vector projection The vector projection of a on b is a vector whose magnitude is the scalar projection of a on b with the same direction as b. Namely, it is defined as : \\\\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1 \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b} = (\\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\cos \\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b} where a_1 is the corresponding scalar projection, as defined above, and \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b} is the unit vector with the same direction as b: : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b} = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\}\\\\, Vector rejection By definition, the vector rejection of a on b is :\\\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{a}_1 Hence, :\\\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\\\mathbf{a} - (\\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\cos \\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b}. Definitions in terms of a and b When Œ∏ is not known, the cosine of Œ∏ can be computed in terms of a and b, by the following property of the dot product a‚ãÖb: \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\, \\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\} = \\\\cos \\\\theta. Scalar projection By the above-mentioned property of the dot product, the definition of the scalar projection becomes: a_1 = \\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\cos \\\\theta = \\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\, \\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\} = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\ }. In two dimensions, this becomes a_1 = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a}_x \\\\mathbf{b}_x + \\\\mathbf{a}_y \\\\mathbf{b}_y} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\ }. Vector projection Similarly, the definition of the vector projection of a onto b becomes: \\\\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1 \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b} = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\ } \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\}, which is equivalent to either : \\\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat b}, or : \\\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\^2}{\\\\mathbf{b}} = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\mathbf{b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}}{\\\\mathbf{b}}. Scalar rejection In two dimensions, the scalar rejection is equivalent to the projection of a onto \\\\mathbf{b}^\\\\perp = (-\\\\mathbf{b}_y, \\\\mathbf{b}_x), which is \\\\mathbf{b} = (\\\\mathbf{b}_x, \\\\mathbf{b}_y) rotated 90¬∞ to the left. Hence, a_2 = \\\\leftmathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}^\\\\perp} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\ } = \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a}_y \\\\mathbf{b}_x - \\\\mathbf{a}_x \\\\mathbf{b}_y} {\\\\leftmathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\ }. Such a dot product is called the \\"perp dot product.\\" Vector rejection By definition, :\\\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{a}_1 Hence, :\\\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}} {\\\\mathbf{b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}}{\\\\mathbf{b}}. Properties If 0¬∞ ‚â§ Œ∏ ‚â§ 90¬∞, as in this case, the scalar projection of a on b coincides with the length of the vector projection. Scalar projection The scalar projection a on b is a scalar which has a negative sign if 90 degrees < Œ∏ ‚â§ 180 degrees. It coincides with the length ‚Äñc‚Äñ of the vector projection if the angle is smaller than 90¬∞. More exactly: * a1 = ‚Äña1‚Äñ if 0 ‚â§ Œ∏ ‚â§ 90 degrees, * a1 = ‚àí‚Äña1‚Äñ if 90 degrees < Œ∏ ‚â§ 180 degrees. Vector projection The vector projection of a on b is a vector a1 which is either null or parallel to b. More exactly: * a1 = 0 if Œ∏ = 90¬∞, * a1 and b have the same direction if 0 ‚â§ Œ∏ < 90 degrees, * a1 and b have opposite directions if 90 degrees < Œ∏ ‚â§ 180 degrees. Vector rejection The vector rejection of a on b is a vector a2 which is either null or orthogonal to b. More exactly: * a2 = 0 if Œ∏ = 0 or Œ∏ = 180 degrees, * a2 is orthogonal to b if 0 < Œ∏ < 180 degrees, Matrix representation The orthogonal projection can be represented by a projection matrix. To project a vector onto the unit vector a = (ax, ay, az), it would need to be multiplied with this projection matrix: : P_a = a a^\\\\mathrm{T} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_x \\\\ a_y \\\\ a_z \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_x & a_y & a_z \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_x^2 & a_x a_y & a_x a_z \\\\ a_x a_y & a_y^2 & a_y a_z \\\\ a_x a_z & a_y a_z & a_z^2 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} Uses The vector projection is an important operation in the Gram‚ÄìSchmidt orthonormalization of vector space bases. It is also used in the Separating axis theorem to detect whether two convex shapes intersect. Generalizations Since the notions of vector length and angle between vectors can be generalized to any n-dimensional inner product space, this is also true for the notions of orthogonal projection of a vector, projection of a vector onto another, and rejection of a vector from another. In some cases, the inner product coincides with the dot product. Whenever they don't coincide, the inner product is used instead of the dot product in the formal definitions of projection and rejection. For a three- dimensional inner product space, the notions of projection of a vector onto another and rejection of a vector from another can be generalized to the notions of projection of a vector onto a plane, and rejection of a vector from a plane. M.J. Baker, 2012. Projection of a vector onto a plane. Published on www.euclideanspace.com. The projection of a vector on a plane is its orthogonal projection on that plane. The rejection of a vector from a plane is its orthogonal projection on a straight line which is orthogonal to that plane. Both are vectors. The first is parallel to the plane, the second is orthogonal. For a given vector and plane, the sum of projection and rejection is equal to the original vector. Similarly, for inner product spaces with more than three dimensions, the notions of projection onto a vector and rejection from a vector can be generalized to the notions of projection onto a hyperplane, and rejection from a hyperplane. In geometric algebra, they can be further generalized to the notions of projection and rejection of a general multivector onto/from any invertible k-blade.

He was re- elected to the 24th Seanad in 2011, despite pressure on him to resign in order to make way for newer Fianna F√°il candidates; this was a strategy devised by party leader Miche√°l Martin in an attempt to recover from the party's disastrous result at the 2011 general election. √ì Murch√∫'s re-election was credited to support from Sinn F√©in voters who had not contested the panel. On 15 September 2011, at a meeting of the Fianna F√°il parliamentary party, the issue of the 2011 presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, √ì Murch√∫ sought to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen as a challenge to the authority of Miche√°l Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. √ì Murch√∫ withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. In 2012, √ì Murch√∫ was listed as having the worst attendance record of any Senator, having missed 19 of 61 votes. The Irish Independent newspaper later published an apology, because √ì Murch√∫'s absence was owing to his wife's illness while on a business trip to the United States of America.

The expression is believed to be first seen in Ptolemy's Geography c. 150. The term was reintroduced in the 15th century from the rediscovery of Ptolemy's work during the Age of Discovery. The equivalent on French maps would be terres inconnues (plural form), and some English maps may show Parts Unknown. Similarly, uncharted or unknown seas would be labeled mare incognitum, Latin for \\"unknown sea\\".  Details  An urban legend claims that cartographers labelled such regions with \\"Here be dragons\\". Although cartographers did claim that fantastic beasts (including large serpents) existed in remote corners of the world and depicted such as decoration on their maps, only one known surviving map, the Hunt‚ÄìLenox Globe, in the collection of the New York Public Library, actually says \\"Here are dragons\\" (using the Latin form \\"HIC SVNT DRACONES\\"). However, ancient Roman and Medieval cartographers did use the phrase HIC SVNT LEONES (Here are lions) when denoting unknown territories on maps. Alternatively, 'terra incognita' may also refer to the hypothesized continent Terra Australis Incognita (\\"The unknown land of the South\\"), as seen in the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum map by Abraham Ortelius (1570). During the 19th century terra incognita disappeared from maps of the earth, since both the coastlines and the inner parts of the continents had been fully explored. But the bottoms of the seas remain mostly un-mapped, as do many other land surfaces in the solar system. The phrase is now also used metaphorically by various researchers to describe any unexplored subject or field of research. Etymology * Terra: Latin for 'earth' or 'land'. Related English words include terrestrial, territory and terrain. * Incognita: from Latin cognoscere 'to know, be acquainted with' (negated by the prefix 'in-'), which is related to English know and Greek Œ≥ŒΩ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ gnosis 'knowledge'.

It is supposedly located below the ice of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, an area disputed between Argentina and Chile. The 1988 eruption deposited ash and pumice on the ice field and produced a mudflow that reached Viedma Lake. The exact position of the edifice is unclear, both owing to the ice cover and because the candidate position, the \\"Viedma Nunatak\\", does not clearly appear to be of volcanic nature.  Geography and geomorphology  Viedma is located in the southern Patagonian Andes, southwest of Mount FitzRoy. The lake of the same name lies southwest of the volcano. The area is poorly accessible and the volcanic history poorly known. Viedma is part of the Austral Volcanic Zone. This volcanic zone consists of six volcanoes, from north to south Lautaro, Aguilera, Viedma, Reclus, Monte Burney and Fueguino. These volcanoes form a long chain of volcanoes, the most southern of which is a volcanic complex of lava domes and lava flows on Cook Island. Few things are known with certainty about the volcanic edifice of Viedma as it is mostly buried beneath glacial ice and the \\"Viedma Nunatak\\" was later revealed to not be a volcano. In 1956 Louis Lliboutry proposed that volcanic activity may occur in fissure vents buried beneath glaciers; between eruptions they would be concealed below the ice; Lliboutry considered dark bands on the ice to be tephra deposits, a view supported by a 1958-1959 expedition that found pumice on the Viedma Glacier. Other reports of volcanic phenomena in the region exist, and the existence of a large caldera beneath the Southern Patagonian Ice Field has been suggested as an explanation for volcanism there.  Viedma Nunatak  The Viedma Glacier and the Viedma Nunatak (centre-right) The Viedma Nunatak is commonly interpreted to be the site of the volcano, after observations made in 1944-1945 and 1950 by survey flights including controversial sightings of fumaroles which also led to the nunatak becoming known as the \\"Volcan Viedma\\"; but the lack of clear evidence and the difficulty of field sampling has rendered its identification with the Viedma vent contentious. The nunatak is about high above sea level. Most of the mountain is buried beneath the Viedma Glacier of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field and only parts of it crop out. The outcropping nunatak is elongated in north-south direction. A number of structures interpreted as craters and concave depressions are found especially on the southern part of the volcano, some of which are lined up in north-south direction. The northern sector of the volcano was apparently more heavily affected by glacial erosion; conversely, several craters in the southern sector appear to be young. The nunatak shows clear evidence of glacial action, including glacial striations and coverage by glacial drifts; the Viedma glacier may once have crossed the nunatak in its central part. Rock samples taken from the nunatak are Jurassic metamorphic rocks, including gneiss and schists, and no evidence of magmatic rocks was found in a 1958-1959 expedition. Different observations have yielded different sizes and numbers of supposed craters; Gonz√°lez-Ferr√°n et al. 1995 reported several craters and calderas with sizes ranging , while Kobayashi et al. 2010 observed fewer craters and none of them larger than . These craters were later interpreted as being actually glacial cirques containing tarn lakes.  Geology  Map of the volcanic zones arcs in the Andes, and subducted structures affecting volcanism Off the southernmost west coast of South America, the Antarctic Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate at a rate of . This subduction process is responsible for volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone. The Austral Volcanic Zone is one of four volcanic zones in the Andes, the other three are the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Southern Volcanic Zone, all of which are separated from the Austral Volcanic Zone and each other by gaps where no volcanic activity occurs. Unlike the Austral Volcanic Zone, volcanism in these other zones is controlled by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. The Austral Volcanic Zone was identified as such in 1976, but some volcanoes were identified and localized later. Owing to their similar composition the three northerly volcanoes Lautaro, Viedma and Aguilera are grouped as the \\"northern Austral Volcanic Zone\\". Volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone is not well known before the Holocene; it is likely that a lull of volcanism occurred before the Pliocene while the Chile Triple Junction was being subducted in the region. Magmas from the Austral Volcanic Zone are adakitic owing to the melting of the subducting slab and the interaction of these melts with the crust and mantle. The basement consists of metamorphic rocks of Paleozoic age. Outcrops of the basement are found around the volcano and could even occur on the edifice that crops out from the glaciers. The regional basement is formed by these Paleozoic and younger metamorphic and sedimentary rocks as well.  Composition  Viedma like other volcanoes of the Austral Volcanic Zone has erupted andesite and dacite. Phenocrysts include amphibole, biotite, hypersthene and plagioclase; orthoclase, plagioclase and pyroxene also occur as xenoliths. The rocks form a calcalkaline suite, but there is also an adakitic signature. The xenoliths may reflect a crustal contamination of the magma erupted at Viedma.  Eruption history  Tephra attributed to Viedma has been found in the Laguna Potrok Aike, including three tephra layers 26,991 - 29,416, 40,656 - 48,219 and 41,555 - 57,669 years before present which may originate either on Viedma or on Lautaro. Viedma has erupted during the Holocene; a tephra found in Lago Cardiel and dated 3,345 - 3,010 years before present may have originated at Viedma, although Aguilera and Lautaro are also candidate source volcanoes. Due to the absence of traces of volcanism at Viedma Nunatak the Global Volcanism Program removed its entry for Viedma in 2019.  Historical  Many observations referring to volcanic activity on the Southern Patagonian Ice Field exist, including reports of ashfalls, layers of tephra on glaciers and columns of smoke rising from the ice. A subglacial eruption occurred in 1988, depositing ash and pumice on the Viedma Glacier. These materials later gave rise to a lahar. The eruption had melted part of the ice and formed a network of valleys; it was assumed that it had taken place at some point between September and November of that year.  Hazards  There are no major population centres close to any volcano in the Austral Volcanic Zone, and the volcanoes are largely unmonitored. Among the know eruptions are large Holocene explosive eruptions, while historical eruptions took place in 1908 at Reclus and 1910 at Monte Burney. Future eruptions of volcanoes in the Austral Volcanic Zone may lead to ash fall at large distances from the volcano, including interruptions in air traffic and direct ash damage.

The Treaty of London between the Netherlands and Belgium in 1839 recognised the independence of Belgium. As part of the treaty, Belgium had the right to build a road or canal from Sittard to the Prussian border over Dutch territory, with Belgium funding the construction. This right was further established in the Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873. At first, Belgium planned to dig a canal, but in the end it opted for a railway. In 1868, construction of the Iron Rhine started, and in 1879, the first trains used the railway. Initially, traffic was dense and frequent, but it decreased over time. Currently the railroad is used by some trains between Antwerp and the zinc factory in Budel, and between Budel and Weert. The line Weert - Roermond is part of the Dutch InterCity network, and is used daily by many trains. Between Roermond and the German border, traffic has fully ceased since 1991. Current operation Although the Iron Rhine is not fully operational, of its tracks are in regular use. of the route is double tracked and is electrified. However, the 16.5 kilometers (Roermond-Dalheim) are not operational and a further (Budel-Weert) are used only rarely. of track in Dalheim, on the German side is fully overgrown. On the German section M√∂nchengladbach-Dalheim RegionalBahn trains run alongside freight trains, long distance travel no longer takes place on the German section. On the Belgian and Dutch side of the track the route is used extensively by InterCity - Interregio -, local and freight trains. Germany The Schwalm-Nette-Bahn (RB 34) traverses the line between M√∂nchengladbach Hbf and Dalheim, directly on the border with the Netherlands. It is operated on behalf of DB Regio by Rurtalbahn and runs during peak times every hour and off peak every two hours. The line runs through the territory of the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (AVV) and the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR). The train stops only when needed at the Arsbeck and M√∂nchengladbach- Genhausen halts. The Rurtalbahn uses railcars of type RegioSprinter on the line. A resumption of cross-border passenger traffic between Dalheim and Roermond (with a Meinewegstation) is the aim of the AVV by 2015.Aachener Zeitung / Aachener Nachrichten, 1 March 2008, the target network avv 2015 Freight transportation is provided to military base near Rheindahlen and to the connection for the Test- and Validationcenter Wegberg-Wildenrath near Arsbeck/Klinkum. Netherlands Iron Rhine in the Netherlands The Dutch section between Weert-Roermond, since the abandonment of the stations Buggenum, Baexem-Heythuysen, and Kelpen in the 1940s, sees no more regional trains. The stations Roermond and Weert are connected with each other, however, by InterCity trains of the Netherlands Railways. These trains link Amsterdam and Schiphol with the South Limburgian cities Heerlen and Maastricht every fifteen minutes. Double-decker EMUs of type DD IRM are mainly used. Belgium Given its proximity to the large Belgian port city of Antwerp, freight and passenger traffic between Antwerp, Lier and Mol (the line branches here to Hasselt and Neerpelt) has always been relatively dense. The section between Mol and Neerpelt (inoperational after the Second World War) was, because of political pressure from the municipalities Lommel and Neerpelt, reactivated on 27 May 1978. Iron Rhine in Belgium by Lier A long-distance inter-regional line (IR e) connects Hamont with Antwerp every hour. The trains start in Hamont, combine in Mol with a train partition from (or to) Hasselt, (or on the way back splits) and travels via Herentals and Lier to Antwerpen Centraal. In Herentals a branch line connects to the city of Turnhout, which is served by two lines of the SNCB; the InterCity R and the Interregio g. The latter, hourly train, uses the same route Herentals‚ÄìLier‚ÄìAntwerp as the Interregio e (Antwerp‚ÄìLier‚ÄìHerentals‚ÄìMol‚ÄìHasselt/Neerpelt). The InterCity R, which also travels hourly, however, leaves the Iron Rhine in Lier, and reaches Brussels-Midi via Mechelen. The section Antwerp-Lier is also used by the Interregio c(Antwerp-Lier-Aarschot-Liege) and by local trains on the route Antwerp-Lier-Aarschot-Leuven. The service offering is reinforced along the trunk route of the Iron Rhine, with hourly local trains on the route Antwerp- Lier-Herentals-Mol serving smaller intermediate stations. In addition, the only during peak travel time circulating P-Train (Piekuurtrein / Train d'heure de pointe come) will also use the route. On weekends and holidays, the traffic is modest and the route will be run only by the IR e, the IR cand IR g at hourly intervals, whereas the IC-, P-, and L-trains do not run. Smaller stations will be serviced either by the IR gor not at all. The rolling stock used by the IR e and P-and L-Trein are diesel trains of the NMBS Class 41. InterCity traffic use AM80 break-motor coaches and locomotive-hauled trains (HLE21/27) with M5 or M6 Bilevel rail cars. The IR g and IR c use AM80 Break- railcars and the L-Trein service Antwerp-Lier-Aarschot-Leuven use railcars of type NMBS Class AM 86-89. Reopening of border section The Iron Rhine in Vlodrop In 2004, Belgium requested a reopening of the Iron Rhine. The government stated it was the result of the increasing transport of goods between the port of Antwerp and the German Ruhr Area. As part of the European policy of modal shift on the increasing traffic of goods, transport over railway lines and waterways is preferred over road transport. Currently Belgium uses the , south of the Iron Rhine, from Antwerp to Aachen via Aarschot, Hasselt, Tongeren and Montzen, for transportation of goods to Germany. High passenger traffic on parts of this route causes a lack of capacity for goods, and a number of steep inclines over the route make it problematic for long and heavy trains. The Belgian request is based on the treaty of 1839, and the Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873. Critics felt that Belgium could not invoke these treaties, as the 1873 treaty granted Belgium a concession of 99 years on the Iron Rhine route, a period which ended in 1972. Furthermore, Belgium had sold the railroad to the Dutch Government. The argument that carries most weight in the Netherlands is that the railroad runs through the nature reserve of De Meinweg, and nature activists fear the destruction of the local habitat of several threatened species, whereas Belgian interests consider this to be a delaying tactic while the Netherlands completes the Betuwe line. After a series of failed negotiations, the Belgian and Dutch governments agreed to take the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration and respect its ruling in the case. In its ruling of 24 May 2005, the court acknowledged both the Belgian rights under the cessation treaty of 1839 and the Dutch concerns for the nature reserve. The 1839 treaty still applies, the court found, giving Belgium the right to use and modernize the Iron Rhine. However, it has to finance the modernisation of the line, while the Netherlands have to fund the repairs and maintenance of the route. Both countries will split the costs of the construction of a tunnel beneath the nature reserve. The reopening would allow heavier trains than on the Montzenroute (2000 tonnes in both directions compared to 800 and 1300 tonnes); and a shorter journey (162 km compared to 211 km); it would reopen some time after 2015.Infrabel: Steel Rhine railway line Currently the Dutch and Belgian authorities remain discussing the route the Iron Rhine would take. Main point of contention is whether the route should go through Meinweg national park.

Although many of the stories do not contain references to any particular setting, it is most likely that all stories in the anthology are set in Perth, Western Australia, around the late (post-World War II) 20th century. Most of the stories deal with relationships which are placed under hardship and stress, it also deals with the theme of men and masculinity. They are written in a minimalist style typical of Tim Winton. Perhaps the most prominent theme throughout all the stories is not necessarily the adversity these people are placed under, but the way in which they react to the problems confronting them. For example- Jerra Nilsam doesn't try to deal with his problems at all; preferring to accept his circumstances and be depressed about it. Jerra a failed rock musician chose marriage and he is the stay at home carer who wonders where the music, the happiness the money of their earlier life has gone. Rachel doesn't address the cause of her problems, but moves on from them, determined to better herself with education and a career. Jerra's father accepts his illness (cancer), but rather than wallowing in it, decides to make the most of his remaining days. The unnamed boy in \\"No Memory Comes\\" uses denial to deal with his problems, assuring himself that things are not changing, and that 'he doesn't mind' when things do. Queenie Cookson is possibly the most successful, going back to her old town to confront her past demons, deal with them, and then be able to move on in her life. In the title story Minimum of two Madigan, rather than dealing with the actual problems arising from his wife's rape, decides to deal with the cause, killing her rapist once he is released from prison. Many of the stories mentioned in this book relate to two common characters found throughout the book, Jerra and Rachel Nilsam. Rachel and Jerra are two very separated people who learn to live together through the birth of their son Sam. Sam provides the two with a connection which ultimately always pulls them through their everyday and life struggles. Since 2005 the anthology has been included in the VCE reading list, as an option for study by Year 11 and 12 English Students.

Professional career Lydon was educated at St Eunan's College in Letterkenny, County Donegal; University College Galway; University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin. His bachelor's degree was in sociology and English; his postgraduate work was in the area of education and psychology. Lydon has also worked as a consulting psychologist. For a number of years, he was a non-executive director of Connsbrook Productions Limited and a non-executive of Corona Holidays Limited in Dublin. He has published a number of papers in professional journals, mostly in the area of alcoholism or psychopathology in adolescents. Lydon was awarded a Council of Europe Medical Fellowship in 1977 in order to go abroad to study \\"Residential Treatment of Disturbed Adolescents\\". He was the first psychologist in Ireland to receive such a fellowship. Political career He was a member of Dublin County Council from 1985 to 1993 and was a member of D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council from 1994 to 2002. He was first elected to Seanad √âireann in 1987 and was elected at all subsequent elections until his defeat at the 2007 election. He has at various times been the Senior Senate Spokesman on Justice, Senior Senate Spokesman on the Department of the Taoiseach and European Affairs, Senior Senate Spokesman on European Affairs, and laterally held the position of Spokesman on Foreign Affairs with Special Responsibility for Overseas Development Assistance and Human Rights. He has served as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Women‚Äôs Rights, the Joint Services Committee, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social, Community & Family Affairs and was laterally a member of the Joint Parliamentary European Affairs Committee. In February 1993, during a meeting in the council chamber of Dublin Corporation, he famously grabbed the Green Party TD Trevor Sargent in a headlock when Sargent waved a cheque, sent to him by a builder. 'Headlock' senator Lydon snubbed by party - Irish Independent article, 22 June 2007. Sargent asked the rest of the council had they been sent any checks, and if they thought that this was a case of the building sector attempting to bribe the council. Lydon was nominated as a candidate for the 23rd Seanad in 2007 and stood as a member of Fianna F√°il. His proposers included Senator Tom Morrissey, former Fianna F√°il Senator Margaret Cox and Fianna F√°il TD Ned O'Keeffe. He lost his Seanad seat in the 2007 election. He was a member of the Irish Council of the European Movement and served as Vice- Chairman from 1991‚Äì1993. He was also a member of both the Council and Executive of The Institute of European Affairs. Donations disclosed to Standards Commission TDs, Senators and MEPs were required to furnish to the Standards Commission their Donations Statements and accompanying documentation each year. Any donations with a value exceeding ‚Ç¨634.87 received during the year must be disclosed. The maximum value of donations which can be accepted from the same donor in the same calendar year is ‚Ç¨2,539.48. Donations received from the same donor must be aggregated and regarded as a single donation for the purposes of the disclosure to the Standards Commission and maximum acceptance limits. TDs, Senators and MEPs are prohibited from accepting anonymous donations exceeding ‚Ç¨126.97 or foreign donations of any value. Lydon disclosed one donation over ¬£500 to the Commission between 1997 and 2005. This was in respect of a political donation of ¬£1,000 received in 1999 from Castlemarket Holdings Limited at the time of the Local Government election.Donations disclosed to Standards Commission by Senators, Fianna F√°il TD's, Senators and MEP's for 1999 Mahon Tribunal The Mahon Tribunal, previously known as The Flood Tribunal, was established by the Irish Government in November 1997. This Inquiry uncovered evidence of politicians and former politicians accepting substantial donations from property developers which coincided with planning decisions that favoured the interests' of donors. Lydon was examined in the course of several modules of inquiry. Lydon proposed the 11 November 1993 motion to Dublin County Council that enabled the development proposed by Monarch Properties at Cherrywood, County Dublin, and he was regarded as the main access to Fianna F√°il support for Monarch proposals. The motion was passed by 44 - 27 votes. A second motion favouring Monarch was signed by Lydon on 10 October 1994. Lydon admitted that he was the most prominent Fianna F√°il supporter of Monarch proposals at the Council. Lead Councillor Bill O'Herlihy a public relations consultant retained by Monarch Properties in 1991, told the Tribunal on 7 June 2006 that he was told by Mr. Richard Lynn in the bar of the Royal Dublin hotel that members of Dublin County Council were alleged to pocket ¬£50,000 per year in return for favourable planning decisions. This 'hearsay evidence' indicated that transaction process involved a property developer developing a bilateral relationship with a lead councillor. The lead councillor would then determine with colleagues what exactly was required to secure a particular vote on a planning or rezoning matter. The lead councillor cited by O'Herlihy in respect of Monarch's interests was Lydon.Bill O'Herlihy's evidence to The Mahon Tribunal 7 June 2006 Lynn told the Tribunal that he had never told this to O'Herlihy and stated that he was not in the Royal Dublin at the time specified by O'Herlihy but was actually at a meeting of Dublin County Council. This appears to have been confirmed by Dunlop's evidence to the Tribunal. Lydon, in evidence, on 19 July 2006 also disputed O'Herlihy's allegation but did acknowledge that Monarch Properties used to take large numbers of councillors to restaurants \\"all over the place\\" when planning decisions in respect of Cherrywood were pending and that he proposed a Monarch related motion on 27 May 1992.Mahon Tribunal transcript, page 33, 19 July 2006 Lydon told the Tribunal on 19 July 2006 that the allegations made against him had damaged his chances of getting elected for a sixth term to the Seanad.Mahon Tribunal transcript - 19 July 2006 It was accepted on Lydon's behalf on 25 July that a Tribunal has the discretion to accept hearsay evidence in the common good.Mahon Tribunal transcript - 25 July 2006 The Tribunal has been requested to rule on the admissibility of O'Herlihy's hearsay evidence which it did on 27 July noting that Lydon had been afforded an opportunity to challenging such evidence, which he has already done.Mahon Tribunal transcript - 27 July 2006 Evidence to Fianna F√°il inquiry Lydon admitted to the Tribunal that evidence he presented to a Fianna F√°il internal inquiry in 2000 into payments received was \\"wrong\\" He told that inquiry that he received payments of ¬£400 to ¬£500 from Monarch Properties at the time of the 1991 and 1999 local elections as well as a contribution of ¬£1,000 towards his 1993 Seanad election campaign. He told the Mahon Tribunal that he had in fact received ¬£600 1991; ¬£2,500 in 1992/92 and ¬£450 in 1999 from this source. He also received an unsolicited political donation ¬£1,000 from Monarch lobbyist Frank Dunlop in 1992/93 for the Senate campaign and a political donation of ¬£250 in 1999 for the Local Government election campaign. Lydon neglected to disclose to the Inquiry, until his attention was drawn to this on 1 May 2003, that he received ¬£5,000 from a developer in a pub in Goatstown in 1992 because the Inquiry \\"never asked him about these things\\". Lydon subsequently proposed a rezoning motion in respect of lands in County Dublin owned by this donor. He also neglected to disclose this money to the internal Fianna F√°il inquiry, details of which were to be forwarded to the Tribunal, nor did he seek to correct his evidence subsequently and he did not consider that his failure to do so adversely impacted his reputation. Seven election contests, one fund raising event Lydon only held one fund-raising event in respect of the 7 elections he contested. This took place in 1991 at The Goat Grill from which a couple of hundred pounds were raised. He explains \\"I was very lucky, people gave me a lot of money\\" and that he would take money from anybody \\"except gangsters\\" if it helped him retain his elected positions. He was never bothered about the perception associated with accepting money and the consequential impact of his vote on planning and rezoning decisions. Lobbyists' role: 'Keep councillors happy' Lydon confirmed in response to the Tribunal that he received no donations, benefits, gifts or assistance from, or o behalf of developers, connected to decisions relating to Quarryvale, west Dublin. He viewed the function of lobbyists as one of keeping councillor happy ‚Äì that is buy them drinks, meals and send them money at election time. Following the establishment of the Tribunal, Frank Dunlop stated in sworn evidence that he met Lydon in the car park of St John of Gods Hospital and that the Tribunal were taping telephones and that he, Dunlop, should be careful about what he said on the telephone about people, particularly politicians. This was rejected by Lydon as being false when he gave evidence to the Tribunal. Carrickmines rezoning Dunlop told the Tribunal in May 2003 that Lydon asked Dunlop for a ¬£5,000 bribe to rezone at Jackson Way, Carrickmines, County Dublin for industrial use but that he accepted ¬£3,000 three days after he, Lydon, signed the Council motion in 1992. These allegations were rejected totally by Lydon when he gave evidence on the basis that the two meetings mentioned by Dunlop did not take place. This evidence was supported by sworn evidence given by independent third parties confirming that Dunlop's allegations were false. Dunlop has since retracted two further allegations he made against Lydon but refused to apologise to Lydon for the damage these false allegations may have done to Lydon's reputation. Criminal Assets Bureau investigation The Criminal Assets Bureau secured a freezing order from the High Court on 26 July 2007 based on its investigation of corruption in respect of bribes allegedly paid to councillors by Frank Dunlop to secure the rezoning on 16 December 1997 by D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council of of land assets owned by Jackson Way Properties at Carrickmines. This rezoning was investigated by the Mahon Tribunal in 2003. Lydon stood charged with corruption following his district court appearance on Friday 22 October 2010 along with 3 other former FF councillors. He was, however, found innocent. Senate expense claims In 2004, Lydon changed his place of residence from Dublin to Donegal to qualify for a different travel and subsistence rate, despite living and working in Dublin. Lydon's yearly claim for travel and subsistence varied from ‚Ç¨37,000 to ‚Ç¨39,000 during the years 2004 to 2006, (in 2007 he claimed ‚Ç¨24,000 as he only worked for 7 months). It has been reported that there will not be an investigation into his expenses as \\"there is no provision for looking into the expenses claims of former members of the Oireachtas\\" On 27 March 2012, after being named in the final report of the Mahon Tribunal for receiving corrupt payments, Lydon resigned from Fianna F√°il before he could be expelled.

In July 2013, he claimed that Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were \\"good Christians\\" while speaking in the Seanad. On realising the absurd nature of his comments, he apologised to the chair and admitted he was distracted.

He was the founding leader of the Regulators, a deputized posse that fought in the Lincoln County War. Early life Boaz Community Park Brewer was born on February 19, 1850 in St. Albans, Vermont. At the age of four, he and his family moved to Boaz, Wisconsin.Wisconsin Historical Society Dictionary of Wisconsin History Brewer moved on to Missouri before arriving in Lincoln County, New Mexico. Brewer tried farming as a profession, and he bought a farm in Lincoln County with this in mind. In the spring of 1871, Brewer began working for Lawrence Murphy, but soon left that job. By 1876, he was working as a cattle foreman for cattleman John Tunstall, owner of one of the largest farms in the area.Wisconsin Historical Society Dictionary of Wisconsin History The Lincoln County War On February 18, 1878, Tunstall was murdered. After Tunstall's murder, a posse was deputized to serve arrest warrants on his killers, with Brewer chosen to lead the posse.Otero, Miguel Antonio (1936) The Real Billy the Kid with new light on the Lincoln County War Rufus Rockwell Wilson, New York, pg. 46 The Regulators originated from that posse, and included Billy the Kid and Jose Chavez y Chavez. Dick Brewer established a bond of friendship with Billy the Kid, Chavez and the rest of Billy the Kid's gang, and he was often accompanied by gang members. Being one of the founders of the Regulators, Brewer sometimes assumed a leadership role when around Billy, Chavez and the rest of their company, and was the first leader of the Regulators during the early stages of the Lincoln County War. The pair remained friends until Brewer's death, and evidently he followed Brewer's lead. Brewer was the most mature of the group, by all accounts, and the rest of the Regulators accepted him in that role. The confirmed killings claimed to have been carried out by the Regulators during Brewer's period as leader were those of Sheriff William Brady, William Morton, deputy George W. Hindman, lawman/outlaw Frank Baker, Buckshot Roberts, and fellow Regulator William McCloskey, whom the Regulators believed to have betrayed them. Brewer did not agree with the killing of Sheriff Brady and Deputy Hindman, but supported and participated in the other murders. Although most of those killed by the Regulators throughout their existence were publicly credited to Billy the Kid, most historians agree that there are doubts as to whether he was the actual killer in most cases, and agree that often their victims were killed during a shootout, with many members of the Regulators firing at the same time, including Brewer. It was, however, Billy the Kid who became known, and through whose notoriety, the fame of the Regulators spread. Brewer was killed by an old buffalo hunter, Buckshot Roberts, during the Gunfight of Blazer's Mills, on April 4, 1878, during which five other Regulators were wounded. Buckshot Roberts was also killed during the gunfight, either by a shot fired by George Coe, whose finger was shot off by Roberts, or Charlie Bowdre.

His storylines include being the possible father of local resident Denise Fox (Diane Parish), his marriage to Yolande Duke (Angela Wynter), an affair with Pat Evans (Pam St Clement), coping with the death of his adoptive son Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle), being assaulted by an unknown assailant in his own shop, coping when Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) and his father Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) begin a vendetta against him, a relationship with Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), being injured after falling from a ladder, discovering that Denise's fianc√© Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) had sex with prostitute Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), suffering a stroke, a relationship with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and becoming embroiled in Claudette's feud with her son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood). On 7 December 2015, Walker filmed his 1,000th episode as Patrick. On 2 August 2019, it was revealed that Patrick had married Sheree Trueman (Suzette Llewellyn), with whom he secretly has a son, Isaac Baptiste (Stevie Basaula). Storylines Trinidadian Patrick arrives in Walford for his former wife Audrey Trueman's (Corinne Skinner-Carter) funeral, reuniting with his two sons, Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) and Anthony Trueman (Nicholas Bailey), after decades apart. After a period of adjustment, the Trueman brothers accept Patrick; however, Paul grows suspicious of him and secretly performs a DNA test, where it is revealed that although Anthony is Patrick's biological son, Paul is not. It transpires that Paul is the son of Patrick's best friend Milton Hibbert (Jeffery Kissoon). Despite the upset, Patrick and Paul maintain a father-son relationship. Patrick becomes close friends with pensioner Jim Branning (John Bardon), who helps him woo Yolande Duke (Angela Wynter) with love letters after Patrick has a holiday romance with her in Trinidad. As a result, Yolande moves to Walford, leaving her strict Christian husband Victor (Ben Thomas), whose attempt to bribe Patrick to finish with Yolande ultimately fails. Patrick and Yolande marry and briefly foster a young girl named Katie (Parhys-Jai Cato) in 2004, though they find it difficult when she is returned to her mother. Paul starts dealing drugs for Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), ultimately leading to his death when he tries to double-cross Andy. Patrick is devastated to lose his son and begins a vendetta against Andy. Patrick rents the car-lot, hiring Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) to do bookkeeping. Patrick and Pat begin a casual affair, which Yolande discovers when Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) informs her; Yolande slaps Pat, who retaliates. Yolande threatens to leave, but Patrick persuades her to rebuild their marriage. Yolande remains resentful and almost strays with Aubrey Valentine (Joseph Marcell), a member of Patrick's former band, The Five Hectors; Aubrey tries to destroy Patrick but fails and the Truemans remain together. Denise Fox (Diane Parish) discovers that a member of Patrick's band is her father although she is unsure which member. Patrick takes a DNA test and it is revealed that he is not Denise's father, but he pretends he is as he has grown attached to her. The truth comes out while Patrick and Denise holiday together; despite initial upset, Denise and the Truemans remain close. Patrick sees Denise as the daughter he never had and acts as grandfather to her two daughters Chelsea (Tiana Benjamin) and Libby (Belinda Owusu). After purchasing the Minute Mart grocery store, Patrick and Yolande run it together. Patrick is assaulted there, and although Chelsea and her friend Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) claim the assailant is Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) in a set-up, it is later revealed to be Craig Dixon (Rory Jennings), whom Patrick had disagreed with over the sale of alcohol. Patrick becomes fearful of leaving his house, but eventually overcomes this with support from his wife and friends. After Yolande impresses a Minute Mart official, she is offered a management position in Birmingham. Yolande accepts and prepares to move, however Patrick is less keen. Yolande leaves for Birmingham in October 2008, leaving Patrick behind to sell their house under the premise he will join her later. However, Yolande ultimately decides she is happier without Patrick and ends their marriage, leaving Patrick devastated; they divorce in 2009. The Fox family move in with Patrick, including Denise's lover Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet), a religious fanatic. When Patrick discovers Lucas is withholding information about a tryst he has had with his ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), Patrick orders him to confess. Lucas responds by blackmailing Patrick, threatening to tell Denise about his criminal past during the 1958 Notting Hill race riots when Patrick was convicted of assault. Patrick's past was revealed anyway, by Chelsea's boyfriend Theo Kelly (Rolan Bell), who is in league with Tommy Clifford (Edward Woodward). Tommy claims to be writing a book about black culture, but it is eventually revealed that he is the man who killed Patrick's fianc√©e, Ruth, in a fire in the 1950s. Patrick is furious, but eventually relents to Tommy's dying wish and forgives his criminal act moments before his death. After attending an over-50s dance, Patrick starts a relationship with Liz Turner (Kate Williams), Denise's former mother-in-law. However, Patrick tires of her quickly and Liz moves away when it is revealed that Lucas is a serial killer who has murdered her son, Owen Turner (Lee Ross). Lucas is eventually imprisoned after holding Denise, Patrick, Libby and Chelsea hostage. Denise is supported through emotional recovery by Patrick and her sister Kim Fox (Tameka Empson). Kim purchases the B&B; in Walford; Patrick and the Fox sisters run the business together, while Patrick also works as a potman in The Queen Vic. When Patrick sees Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) kissing Duncan Willis (Steven France), Ben throws a brick through Patrick's window and confronts him. Ben's father, Phil (Steve McFadden) sees Patrick defending himself against Ben, and starts feuding with Patrick; Phil's aggression towards Patrick only ceases when Ben admits to Phil that he threatened Patrick so as not to divulge that he is gay. Patrick has a brief dalliance with Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins), and later loses his home when Kim's B&B; is burnt down during on Christmas Day. Patrick begins to keep stolen fireworks and alcohol in his home's basement for Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), which enhance the damage done by the fire and results in Kim being unable claim insurance. Patrick moves in with Rose and her sister Dot (June Brown), but he is devastated when his friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison) is murdered. The trauma of the murder deeply affects Patrick, and he decides to leave Walford temporarily to visit his son Anthony, returning a few months later. Patrick becomes friends with Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell). At a funeral of one of Patrick's old friends, they pretend to be in a relationship. Although Patrick has feelings for Cora, she insists they are just friends and their kiss was meaningless. After Patrick admits that he likes her as more than friends, they decide to start a relationship, taking it slowly. Patrick is disgusted when Ben is unmasked as Heather's killer, and it emerges that Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) helped cover it up. The whole square rejects Jay, but Patrick softens towards him when he remembers how he was victimised in the past and takes Jay to live with him as he has nowhere else to go. When Patrick becomes unwittingly involved with the return of Cora's adopted daughter, Ava Hartman (Clare Perkins), Cora ends the relationship, but they remain friends. When Patrick falls off a ladder, injuring his arm and leg, Denise and Kim vow to take care of him. However, when they are too busy, Denise hires Magda Bakowska (Wanda Opalinska) to look after Patrick. This frustrates him and when Magda leaves him on his own, Patrick becomes intoxicated and lashes out at Denise, culminating in her falling and cutting her face. Patrick soon reconciles with Denise, and recovers from his injuries. Patrick befriends Betty Spragg (Tessa Wyatt), and picks her as his dance partner over Cora. Cora is jealous, and makes fun of Betty behind her back, which angers Patrick and puts a strain on their friendship. Cora's granddaughter, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) and Kim plot to get Cora and Patrick back together, locking them in a shed. Patrick then ends his friendship with Betty and resumes a relationship with Cora. Cora and her grandson Dexter Hartman (Khali Best) move in with Patrick briefly, but the relationship ends after Cora makes hurtful comments towards Dot following the death of her son Nick Cotton (John Altman). Patrick suffers a number of mini-strokes, but recovers quickly and decides against visiting a doctor. He finds out that Ian had sex with prostitute Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), so threatens Ian that he will tell Denise. After seeing Ian and Denise leaving, Patrick leaves Denise an urgent voicemail and then suffers a major stroke in the middle of the street and is hospitalised. Patrick loses the ability to speak and is very confused. Anthony returns to Walford to visit Patrick, but Patrick mistakes Anthony for his deceased stepson, Paul. Anthony reveals to Denise that he cannot look after Patrick, so gives Denise ¬£2000 to look after him. Despite Ian's attempts to ensure the safety of his secret by putting Patrick in a care home, he eventually agrees to let Patrick live with him and Denise. However, Rainie reveals the truth to Denise. She tells Ian she forgives him, but when she discovers that Patrick knew but could not tell her because of his stroke, she decides to leave Ian. They then find Patrick's house broken into and trashed. Denise struggles to look after Patrick, but eventually he recovers from his stroke. He dislikes Kim's husband Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), and is suspicious of him but eventually Patrick accepts him, and is glad when Vincent finds an old record Patrick recorded with his former band. Patrick starts dating Vincent's mother, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas). When Denise discovers Lucas's son, Jordan Johnson (Joivan Wade), is in trouble, Patrick is against helping him, but eventually bonds with Jordan's son JJ Johnson (Zayden Kareem) and is against Jordan and Denise visiting Lucas in prison, warning them that Lucas will manipulate them. He then discovers they are helping Lucas get work in the prison and tries to stop it, unsuccessfully. Patrick is shocked when he walks in on Vincent choking Claudette and gets him to stop, but Vincent reveals that Claudette murdered his father, Henry, many years ago, so Patrick attempts to call the police. As Claudette tries to stop him, she falls down the stairs and strikes her head on a brick.

Patrick realises Dot is having problems with her sight and she confides in him that she thinks she is going blind. Patrick takes Dot to lunch, forgetting that he agreed to meet Claudette; Claudette confronts him so he ends their relationship, calling her an evil woman. Claudette then leaves. Patrick supports Dot by booking a doctor's appointment and going with her. Patrick is reunited with Yolande as he is celebrating his 77th birthday in The Queen Vic.

Creation and development=Introduction Patrick was introduced by John Yorke as a replacement parental figure to the Trueman brothers; Anthony (Nicholas Bailey) and Paul (Gary Beadle), following the departure of Audrey Trueman (Corinne Skinner-Carter), the mother of Anthony and Paul who was killed off in September 2001. Patrick first appeared at Audrey's \\"rum-fuelled wake\\" as her estranged husband. Characterisation Walker was keen to play a comic element to the character; telling Larry Jaffee of Walford Gazette, \\"Before joining, I told the producer comedy is an area I would like to explore with the character because there was not enough of it in the show. Patrick treats a lot of things with a certain amount of humour. His way of escaping a problem is to find something funny to do or say or sometimes to get himself out of a tight corner. That‚Äôs really the sort of foundation. I try to put as much humour as possible into the character.\\" In 2018, Patrick was described by Bailey as \\"charisma personified\\" and a \\"Caribbean alpha male\\" who \\"stands his ground\\" and \\"takes no nonsense\\". Yorke revealed that a lot of Patrick's character traits come from ideas from Walker himself, so the character is not stereotypical. The character is known for his trademark laugh, trilby hat and his catchphrase, \\"Yeah, man!\\". Relationships Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter) was introduced in 2003 as a love interest for Patrick. Following their screen marriage in 2004, the characters were involved in the BBC's season \\"Taking Care\\", which covered issues \\"surrounding a different kind of childhood\\". The Truemans were involved in a storyline about fostering after they decided to foster a 14-year-old boy, JJ, following an encounter with him at their Bed and Breakfast. In 2007, executive producer Diederick Santer used Patrick and Yolande to cover a storyline about racism, that according to the producer, was inspired by the 2007 Celebrity Big Brother race row, sparked by supposed racist bullying of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty by UK celebrity Jade Goody. In the storyline, the characters Jay Brown and Sean Slater used racist phrases to the Truemans, and their reaction to the insults. Santer commented, \\"The Celebrity Big Brother race row kicked off as I took charge of my first scripts. I thought it was fascinating because it showed there was a real need for a debate about race in Britain. [Big Brother] didn‚Äôt do it particularly well, so I thought it could be something EastEnders should do. Our stuff won‚Äôt be overly moralistic or preachy but it will tackle this serious issue head on.\\" Wynter was axed from EastEnders in 2008, ending Patrick and Yolande's screen union. Discussing Wynter's axing, Rudolph Walker said: \\"I really enjoyed working with Angela, because apart from anything else, she was a tremendous help to me - we've known each other a long time. I have to be thankful for the time she was in the show, and I'm in regular contact with her. I know she does watch EastEnders and while she obviously misses being part of the cast, she still enjoys it. Whether she's keeping an eye on Patrick or Rudolph, I can't be sure!\\" Racism In February 2009, EastEnders aired its first episode consisting of an entirely black cast. The episode focused up on Patrick and the Fox family. It concentrated on Patrick reminiscing about London in the 1950s after his arrival from the Caribbean. The script involved discussion about racism, with reference to the real life occurrence of the 1958 Notting Hill race riots in London. Taking the discussion of racism further, the characters considered it lessened in the 21st century, but that it still existed, possibly in more subtle forms. The episode averaged 8.37m (35.6%) viewers. It was part of a wider storyline concentrating on Patrick's past, and the murder of his fianc√©e during the race riots. Actor Edward Woodward was brought in especially for the storyline as Tommy Clifford, the man who killed her and subsequently sought his redemption before he died. Reception Following the airing of EastEnders' first all- black cast episode in the show's history in 2009, the BBC received criticism for not adequately advertising the event. The programme-makers refuted these claims, insisting that the storyline received the same publicity treatment as the soap's other ongoing plots. A spokesperson told media website Digital Spy: \\"Everyone at Elstree has been truly shocked and surprised by the attention that an episode with an all-black cast has had, given that we live in such a diverse and multicultural society. [The] episode focuses on Patrick Trueman sharing his experiences of being a young man living in 1950s Britain with the family he lives with (the Foxes) which does mean it is solely an all-black cast on screen.

Some 57 complaints, meanwhile, were logged before it aired.\\" The BBC responded, \\"It is not unusual for EastEnders to devote a whole episode to a single storyline or set of characters, and this episode was one of these occasions. This was an opportunity to explore in some depth the background and experiences of Patrick Trueman, one of EastEnders' longest-standing and most popular characters. There have been many 'all-white' episodes in the show's 24-year history, and we do not believe there is any reason why an 'all-black' episode should not be included within the series. Some viewers felt it was unnecessary to raise the subject of the Notting Hill race riots. These form part of the character's experience, as well as British history, and we feel it was absolutely legitimate for these characters to discuss them.\\" On 2 June 2018, Walker was awarded the \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" at The British Soap Awards 2018 for portraying the role of Patrick for 17 years.

He was a specialist in pain, vascular surgery and the sympathetic trunk. He sensitized many who were mutilated in the first World war, he was the first to be interested in pain and to practice gentle surgery with as little trauma as possible. Two symptoms have the name Algoneurodystrophy and the aortic iliac obliteration. He has trained many students, such as Michael E. DeBakey, J√£o Cid dos Santos, Ren√© Fontaine et Jean Kunlino. Biography He came from a family of Lyonian doctors, his father Ernest Leriche is confessed near the civil court of Roanne (after studying law in Paris) and his mother Anne Chamussy, married to Leriche, belong to the elite industrial region. Rene Leriche was the third child of seven siblings. He is the brother of Marc Leriche, a French sculptor. He attended at the school of Maristes. In 1893, he obtained a bachelor's degree in rhetoric. He then poses a question of following the footsteps of his grandfather, his great-uncle and his uncle in the path of surgery, √âcole Militaire de Saint-Cyr to take on a military career. In March 1894, he changed his mind and wrote to his parents that he wanted to become a surgeon. He completed his bachelor of philosophy to enter the Faculty of Sciences of Lyon in November, and prepared the PCN (Physics, Chemistry, Natural Sciences). In 1899-1900, Leriche did his military service in the 98th Infantry Regiment. He was an intern in 1902, then a doctor of medicine by supporting a thesis on the technique of surgical resection in the treatment of stomach cancer in 1906, under the direction of Antonin Poncet. In Lyon, he became friends with Alexis Carrel, whom he later meet in New York. Ren√© Leriche married Louise H√©liot Calenborn on 27 September 1910 in Lyon. His wife comes from an old Germanic Catholic Family . A doctor herself, she will be his closest collaborator. First World War At the beginning of the war, he was assigned in a surgical ambulance automobile in the Vosges. After a short visit to Creil in a triage and regulation hospital, he was appointed to the Panth√©on hospital. Then he goes to the Russian hospital in the Carlton Hotel. In April 1917, wishing for a long time return to the front, Ren√© Leriche joined Robert Proust and his team of Auto-chir (ACA n o 17). Leriche was asked by the Lyon histologist and radiobiologist Claudius Regaud to enter the training he was preparing for to serve as a \\"School of Medicine and War Surgery in HOE 4 de Bouleuse, near Reims. It became such a renowned centre of instruction and improvement for all physicians and surgeons who passed it that it was decided to admit into active formation the newly-arrived Americans. Ren√© Leriche found several great names in medicine: the brilliant specialist in thoracic surgery Jean-Louis Roux- Berger (well ahead of what was done elsewhere), Lema√Ætre who will remain the creator of the primitive suture of the wounds, the neurologist Georges Guillain, Lyon radiologist Thomas Nogier and pathologist Pierre Masson. However, he had the support for assistant Paul Santy and convert for his department of fractures and joint lesions. A young doctor, freshly arrived, hastened to meet him: Georges Duhamel. With the help of Paul Santy, Leriche undertook very extensive research work on osteogenesis and was particularly interested in repairing fractures with experiments carried out on rabbits, and he was already pursuing scholarly reflections on the role of vasa motricity in the site of trauma. That required many cuts histological and as many X-rays or photographs, but the environment and the organization of the very large 3,000-bed field hospital permitted it. He became chief surgeon on 28 December 1917. During the war, Leriche's idea was to differentiate the traditional white linen in which the wounded were brought from the laundry of the aseptic surgical operating rooms. He chose blue and had the surgical rooms painted blue. All the linen of the operating rooms is also blue: operating linen, casaques, caps, masks. The colour would be adopted worldwide, and the convention will make it possible to minimise infectious contamination. Interwar period He became a surgeon of the hospitals in Lyon in 1919. A stay in the United States allowed for him to meet Simon Flexner (who advocates \\"smooth\\" surgery) at the Rockefeller Foundation and then William Halsted in Baltimore but a number of surgeons also had an influence on him. In 1924, he was the holder of the chair at The University of Strasbourg, who responded to the call of the dean Georges Weiss after the death of Louis Sencert. He introduced the important notion of non aggressive surgery. In 1925, during his inaugural lecture at the chair of surgical clinic of the University of Strasbourg. He said that surgery should no longer be limited to the correction or removal of anatomical lesions but should address the treatment of functional disorders. He cured and amputated Marshal Joffre at the end of his life. In 1936 he succeeded Charles Nicolle at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, where he occupied the chair of Experimental Medicine from 1937 to 1950. This enabled him to continue his research by creating a laboratory for experimental surgery and conceptualizing his theories on Physiology and pathology. In the wake of Claude Bernard, Leriche states that \\"the disease appears above all as a functional perversion. Second World War Back in Lyon after the armistice of 22 June 1940, he declined the post of health minister who was offered by the French head of state, Philippe P√©tain. He, however, accepted the presidency of the National Order of Physicians, created in October 1940 by the Vichy r√®gime, which strengthened the state's hold over the organization of medicine, supported the numerus clausus in medical studies and applied an important role in the exclusion of Jewish doctors by participating in their denunciation and especially the process of despoiling \\"vacant\\" practices. Several years after the war, he would say that he left because he disagreed with the directive of the state. He justified his attitude by stating, like other defenders, that the r√©gime served as a shield against the occupiers. Like many people engaged in the collaboration with Vichy, he would be hardly troubled and minimised his involvement. Post-War At the Liberation of France, he was expelled from the official circuits. However, he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences and of the National Academy of Medicine in 1945. He corrected the proofs of his autobiography shortly before his death. The book was published in 1956, under the title, chosen by the publisher, Souvenirs de ma vie morte.

He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin Central constituency from 2007 to 2011. Brady is a former civil servant who for 20 years, ran the constituency office of the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Political career In 2002, Brady was nominated by the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, as a member of the 22nd Seanad √âireann. 2007 general election In late 2005, Brady and his brother Royston, a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and unsuccessful candidate for the European Parliament, were both reported to be in contention for a Fianna F√°il nomination in the Dublin Central constituency. Although Dublin Central was the constituency of the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and was considered a strong Fianna F√°il constituency there was stiff competition from other parties. In 2002 the second Fianna F√°il TD Dermot Fitzpatrick had been elected in 2002 with a narrow margin of just 79 votes over the Sinn F√©in candidate Nicky Kehoe. The rivalry between the brothers led to a public call from a third brother, Fulton Brady, to \\"put an end to it\\". Royston was not one of the four contenders nominated for at the selection conference in March 2006, when Cyprian Brady and Councillor Mary Fitzpatrick were selected as Ahern's two running-mates. Fitzpatrick was the daughter of the outgoing TD Dermot Fitzpatrick. At the 2007 general election, held under Ireland's single transferable vote system, Brady polled just 939 first preference votes (2.7%) in the first count. However he was elected on the fourth count, due in large part to a pre-arranged electoral strategy seeing large transfers from his running mate, the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, and became only the second ever TD (after Brian O'Higgins) to be elected with less than 1,000 first-preference votes. His election became the subject of a public interest (in large part because his running mate was the sitting Taoiseach), covered in national newspapers and on the RT√â Radio 1 news programme Drivetime and on the weekly Documentary on One which had been covering the campaigns of the three female candidates in the constituency. Mary Fitzpatrick, daughter of the outgoing Fianna F√°il TD and the third Fianna F√°il candidate in the 4-seat constituency, received 1,725 first-preference votes and 1,362 (whereas Brady received 2,403). On the night before polling day, 24 May 2007, Fitzpatrick distributed leaflets to households asking people to vote for her as their first preference. In the early hours of the following morning, a letter had been hand-delivered from Ahern's office to 30,000 voters in the constituency, urging them give their first preference to the Taoiseach and their second to Brady. Since Ahern was expected to be elected with a large surplus, and the overall Fianna F√°il vote was likely to be large enough to elect two candidates, the destination of the Taoiseach's transfers would determine whether Brady or Fitzpatrick won the second Fianna F√°il seat in Dublin Central. After Ahern's transfers secured Brady's election, Fitzpatrick complained that \\"I didn't think they'd go out to completely undermine me and shaft me.\\" Ahern's election agent Chris Wall blamed Fitzpatrick, saying \\"She was asked not to do this sort of thing. Having then done it, she therefore effectively set in train a motion she wasn't going to be able to stop.\\" Brady said \\"An election is an election and not everybody can win\\", adding \\"Mary is a colleague of mine and she is a very good councillor. It's not really fair for Mary to be blaming anybody\\". 2011 general election In January 2011, he was selected as a Fianna F√°il candidate in Dublin Central for the 2011 general election along with Mary Fitzpatrick. Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said his loyalties this time would be with the sitting TD (Brady), and there was no hope of Fianna F√°il winning two seats in the constituency. He lost his seat having received 1,637 votes (4.7%).

He contested the 1997 general election as an independent candidate having failed to get a Fianna F√°il nomination to run for the party. He later rejoined Fianna F√°il and was nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad √âireann in 2002, but left the party again on 29 April 2004 to join the Progressive Democrats (PD), after a dispute arising from the end of the dual mandate.

She did not win a nomination, and speculation that she would be imposed as a candidate by the national party did not happen. Rose Brennan also defected to the Progressive Democrats, and was elected as a PD County Councillor for Bruff. She subsequently became Vice Cathaoirleach of Limerick County Council, and in the 2009 local elections she was elected as a Fine Gael member of the council for the Adare area.

He is a retired farmer and former agricultural journalist. Early and personal life Dardis was educated at the Dominican College in Newbridge, County Kildare and at University College Dublin, where he graduated with a degree in Agricultural Science. He is married to Beatrice Lane, and has one son and two daughters. He lives in Newbridge. Political career Dardis served in Seanad √âireann from 1989 until he retired in 2007, being nominated by the Taoiseach in 1989, 1997 and 2002, and elected by the Agricultural Panel in 1992 (this was facilitated by an electoral pact with Democratic LeftChapter 10 The Subterranean Election of the Seanad Michael Gallagher and Liam Weeks UCC). He was also a member of Kildare County Council for twelve years, representing the Kildare town electoral area from the 1991 local elections until he stood down from the council in 2003 on the abolition of the dual mandate under the Local Government Act 2001. He stood for election to D√°il √âireann for the Kildare constituency at the 1992, but was unsuccessful. After the division of the constituency, he stood again in the Kildare South constituency at the 1997 general election and again in 2002, but was defeated on both occasions. He also stood for election to the European Parliament in the Leinster constituency at the 1989 and 1994 elections. Salmon drift-nets In October 2005, Dardis launched a Progressive Democrats (PD) policy document which advocated a ban on the use of drift nets to catch salmon in Irish waters, and called for \\"fair and appropriate\\" compensation for licence- holders. The policy was agreed at the party's conference in Galway. The PDs' policy contradicted that of the coalition government (with Fianna F√°il) of which they were part, and came days before a report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recommended similar measures. The party was accused of \\"political opportunism\\" by the Green Party of only taking an interest in the issue in advance of a Government policy shift, and Tommy Broughan of the Labour Party said \\"‚ÄúThe PDs had seven years to do something about this and they did nothing. Now they are taking a sudden interest in the issue on the eve of our report coming out.\\" In a letter to The Irish Times, Dardis ‚Äì who is a keen angler, ‚Äì replied that the party had opposed drift-netting since 1999. The governmented then established an Independent Salmon Group to review policy, and the group's report in October 2006 recommended radical measures to halt \\"the catastrophic decline of Irish salmon stocks\\", including both a ban drift nets and on angling for salmon in major rivers including the Liffey, Boyne, Barrow, Nore and Suir. In November 2006, the government imposed a ban on drift-netting with effect from January 2007, accompanied by a ‚Ç¨30m hardship fund. The decision was publicly criticised by the junior minister responsible, Pat \\"the Cope\\" Gallagher, whose Donegal South-West was one of the most-important drift-netting area. He said that he did not accept the basis of the scientific report on which the Cabinet had agreed the policy change. The decision was supported by angling groups, but opposed by sea-fishermen, some 400 of whom marched on the D√°il. The drift- netters' anger was directed at the Cabinet Minister, Noel Dempsey, with one poster in the village of Passage East in County Waterford reading \\"'Noel Dempsey should be hanged, not Saddam ‚Äì Fianna Fail Out\\". Dardis responded that the government had to act on the scientific advice, and said that \\"the future of a species that has been central to Irish life has been secured by today's decision\\". Conflicts of interest in planning In June 2006, Dardis raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest in the planning system, when local council planning officials take up new jobs with development companies operating in the same area. He told the Seanad that \\"no less than a former county manager of a local authority has taken up a senior position with a development company\\", noting that the move came only three months after the manager had approved planning permission for a large and controversial development by the same company. 2007 election In 2005, Dardis took office as Chairman of the Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party. He had been expected to stand again in Kikdare South at the 2007 general election, but announced his decision in March 2007. Noting that it would be hard for the party to a win a seat in the three-seat constituency, he said \\"We had hoped that the most recent electoral boundary changes would result in a fourth seat for Kildare South but this did not happen\\". He was instead appointed as chair of the party's election campaign. In the election, the PDs lost six of their eight seats in the D√°il, including that of the party leader Michael McDowell. Dardis subsequently headed a committee to examine the options for the party leadership, which recommended that the role be taken on by a senator or councillor to take on the party leadership (the party rules then required that the position must be held by a TD). A meeting of the party's General council on 16 February 2008 changed the rules to allow any senator, councillor or any party member with the support of 20 other members to stand for the party's leadership.

Inspiration came both from successful symphonic power metal band Nightwish and from the myth of Atlantis. History=Eternal Endless Infinity and Line-up changes (2000‚Äì2004) Fascinated by the myth of Atlantis, Werner Fiedler, Thomas Caser, Christian Stani, and Chris Kamper decided in August 2000 to work out a concept inspired by the secret of Atlantis. Late in summer mezzo-soprano Nicole Bogner joined the project, and this was the birth of Visions of Atlantis. A first demo, Morning in Atlantis was released in 2000. In 2001 they signed with TTS Media Music/Black Arrow Productions, and in 2002 their first album, Eternal Endless Infinity was released. In 2003, the band saw some changes in line-up, replacing Christian Stani with Mario Plank and Chris Kamper with Miro Holly. Cast Away and Nicole's departure (2004‚Äì2005) Now with Napalm Records, which released the band‚Äôs second studio effort ‚ÄùCast Away‚Äú worldwide in November 2004. To mark the release, Visions of Atlantis produced their first official music video to the track ‚ÄúLost‚Äú, which received significant airplay on VIVA and MTV, and made it possible for the band to present the album. In early 2005, Visions of Atlantis did their tour across Europe, while being supported by labelmates Elis and Celtic rock based band Lyriel. In late 2005, Bogner left the band due to commitments elsewhere. New singer and 3rd studio album (2005‚Äì2007) After Nicole left the band, she was replaced by American soprano singer Melissa Ferlaak (formerly with Aesma Daeva) and Wolfgang Koch replaced Werner Fiedler. In 2006, Martin Harb, who already played with VoA on their tour in Mexico in 2003, replaced Miro Holly. In May 2007, VoA released their 3rd album Trinity, mastered at Finnvox Studios and recorded at Bavarian Dreamscape Studio). The following autumn brought Visions of Atlantis to the United States, where the band toured together with Epica for 6 weeks and won numerous new fans. Departure of Melissa Ferlaak and Wolfgang Koch (2007‚Äì2008) Upon returning, the band went through changes in the line-up. On November 28, 2007, a message was posted on the official VoA website saying that Melissa Ferlaak and Wolfgang Koch had left the band, both citing personal reasons. Following this Visions of Atlantis announced a few days later that their ex guitarist, Werner Fiedler, had rejoined the band. Joanna Nieniewska and Maxi Nil (2008‚Äì2009) After Melissa's departure, Visions of Atlantis not only looked for a replacement for a singer, but also wrote the song material for the fourth album. The band was advertising on their website the position for a female vocalist for several months, and on September 3, 2008, they finally announced that they had found a new female singer; however, her identity wasn't revealed until February 1, 2009, as the 20-year-old Austrian soprano vocalist Joanna Nieniewska. On July 29, 2009, VoA announced that because of health problems, Joanna Nieniewska is no longer in the band but will continue to support VoA behind the scenes. The band announced the replacement vocalist, Maxi Nil from Greece, and was also known for her work with On Thorns I Lay, guest with Moonspell and her former band Elysion. Delta and \\"Maria Magdalena\\" EP (2010‚Äì2011) On December 3, 2010, VoA announced the new title of their 4th studio album Delta which was released on February 25, 2011 worldwide. On July 18, 2011, bass player Mario Lochert left the band due to crucial internal differences. In a recent interview Harb said that the band is not planning on replacing him. Instead, they will continue without a bassist as a fixed band member. In August 2011, the band announced the title of their first EP Maria Magdalena, it was released on October 21, 2011. Death of Nicole Bogner and Ethera (2012‚Äì2013) On January 6, 2012, Visions of Atlantis announced on their Facebook and MySpace pages that former singer Nicole Bogner had died at the age of 27 after suffering from a severe disease over a long period of time. The band said that they were saddened to have lost their first vocalist, and expressed their gratitude to Bogner for her time with the band.Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed January 8, 2012 On January 27, 2012, the band announced the title Ethera for their upcoming album, which was scheduled to be released in 2012. Ethera was released on March 22, 2013. It was the first album with guitarist Christian Hermsd√∂rfer and with no official bassist. It was dedicated to Bogner's memory. Line-up changes and The Deep & The Dark (2013‚Äì2019) Visions of Atlantis - Wacken Open Air 2018 On December 6, 2013, Visions of Atlantis announced on their Facebook page that most of the line-up was parting ways with Visions of Atlantis, leaving the only remaining and founding member Thomas Caser on drums. This decision was mostly because of a desire from the parting members to play their own style of music, whilst the band was orientating to go back to its classic style. Thus, it welcomed back some of its old members: Werner Fiedler (guitars), Chris Kamper (synths), and Michael Koren (bass). Maxi Nil was replaced by Cl√©mentine Delauney, and Mario Plank by Siegfried Samer. Michael Koren was replaced by Herbert Glos on bass in late 2017, and Werner Fiedler by Christian Douscha at the same time. Chris Kamper left the band in 2015. Their new album The Deep & The Dark was released on February 16, 2018. Wanderers (2019) After extensive tours with Serenity and Kamelot as well as several festival shows in 2018, the band released their first live album The Deep & The Dark Live @ Symphonic Metal Nights on February 16, 2019, which featured new male lead singer Michele Guaitoli (from Italian symphonic metal band Temperance) sharing lead vocal duty with Siegfried Samer, the former having permanently replaced the latter at the end of the Symphonic Metal Nights IV tour in late 2018. The band then announced on July 1, 2019 that their seventh album Wanderers will be released on August 30, 2019 via Napalm Records. The album will again feature Cl√©mentine Delauney and Michele Guaitoli sharing lead vocal duties.

He made his first appearance in the episode broadcast on 11 December 2000 and left in 2003 but returned in 2004 and 2005 for brief stints such as the wedding of Yolande Duke (Angela Wynter) and Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). Anthony made a brief return on 22 July 2014 following Patrick's stroke. He returned whilst EastEnders was off-screen during the Coronavirus pademic after Patrick had contracted COVID-19 and was put into intensive care for a month due to his age and having underlying health conditions. Storylines Anthony is the younger son of Patrick (Rudolph Walker) and Audrey Trueman (Corinne Skinner-Carter) and the brother of Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle). He is the brains of an otherwise dysfunctional family, and his dodgy-dealing brother Paul always feels under his shadow. Anthony works as a doctor in the Square. Audrey becomes deeply involved with his life, whilst ignoring Paul. She disapproves of Anthony dating Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and tries to interfere many times, leading to Anthony rebelling against his mother. When Audrey dies, Anthony's long lost father, Patrick, arrives for Audrey's funeral, reuniting with his two sons after decades apart. After a period of adjustment, the Trueman brothers accept Patrick; however, Paul grows suspicious of him and secretly performs a DNA test, where it is revealed that although Anthony is Patrick's biological son, Paul is not. After Kat breaks up with Anthony, he and Kat's teenage daughter Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) begin an affair. Zoe disowns Kat for disapproving of their relationship, and later runs away when Anthony reveals that he is still in love with Kat. Anthony and Kat's relationship resumes, but Zoe returns and catches them in bed together. Zoe then accepts they are together. After Kat fails to impress Anthony's colleagues she breaks up with him as he is about to propose. Kat discovers she is pregnant by him and decides to have an abortion. Her boss Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) persuades her not to, but she suffers a miscarriage while on her way to tell Anthony of the pregnancy. Kat then breaks up with Anthony again after realising he is not who she wants. In 2003, when Anthony causes the death of a pregnant patient, he leaves the Square to go travelling, but returns for Patrick's wedding to Yolande Duke (Angela Wynter) and Paul's funeral. After living in Cambodia for several years, Anthony returns to the UK and settles in Glasgow, marries a woman named Sophie and has children. In 2013, Patrick falls from a ladder and considers staying with Anthony but decides not to. In 2014, Anthony is featured in a medical journal, in an article about his work in Cambodia, a copy of which Patrick buys. After hearing about Patrick's stroke, he returns to Walford, though Patrick mistakes him for Paul. Despite feeling obliged to take care of his father, Anthony admits he cannot forgive Patrick's absence during his childhood. He writes Denise Fox (Diane Parish) a cheque for ¬£2000 to help look after Patrick and returns to Scotland. In 2020, while the show is offscreen. He returned to look after Patrick in hospital after he contracted COVID-19 during the pandemic. And afterwards invited Patrick and Sheree to stay with him during lockdown and the pair make amends. Creation and development In early 2000, it was announced that a new doctor would arrive in EastEnders. A few days later it was announced he would be played by Nick Bailey. Bailey was working for an investment bank unloading boxes, when he received the call about auditioning for Anthony. He explained \\"I was alone in the stockroom when my agent's wife rang and told me I'd got the part. I just jumped up and punched the air, then did a rumba round the room.\\" EastEnders marked Bailey's first major television role. Anthony was introduced as the son of B&B; owner Audrey Trueman (Corinne Skinner-Carter). He made his first on-screen appearance on 11 December 2000. It was later announced his family would arrive later in the year. In December 2002, it was announced that Anthony will begin a relationship with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). \\"Kat and Alfie is a romance just waiting to happen and we don't have to wait long,\\" an insider told The People today. \\"Bosses are convinced they will become the next Den and Angie.\\" Kat, who has only just rekindled her love with her daughter's former fianc√© Anthony Trueman, will ditch him after embarrassing herself at a dinner party the Doc has taken her to. \\"Kat and Anthony's romance has been on- off from day one,\\" the insider added. \\"Kat first realises she has a thing for Alfie when he coaches her on table etiquette before the big date. And after the night goes pear-shaped she flings herself at Alfie saying, 'Anthony is not the man for me'. Alfie, who's fancied Kat since he gave her barmaid's job, is delighted. They kiss and soon become a serious item.\\" Bailey reprised his role in July 2014 for one episode. Anthony returned to Walford following his father's stroke. In 2015, Bailey stated that his return in 2014 was confusing, saying, \\"Anthony was always a man of duty and responsibility so I don't know why he would abandon his father. It was never explained to me and it was all a bit surreal. I'm baffled myself, but then EastEnders now doesn't resemble the show I was in.\\" In popular culture The character of Anthony Trueman has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show 2DTV.

He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin Rathdown constituency from 2016 to 2020, and previously from 2011 to 2016 for the Dublin South constituency. He was a member of Seanad √âireann for the University of Dublin from 1981 to 2011, until his election to D√°il √âireann at the 2011 general election. He is a former business editor of the Sunday Independent. He was a Fine Gael Wicklow County Councillor, and a one-time Fine Gael general election candidate in the Wicklow constituency. In the 31st D√°il he was a member of the D√°il Public Accounts Committee. He co-founded the Independent Alliance with Michael Fitzmaurice in 2015. He was re-elected to the 32nd D√°il, and subsequently appointed by Taoiseach Enda Kenny as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in May 2016. Early life and career Shane Ross was born in Dublin in 1949. He is the son of former Senator and prominent member of the legal fraternity, John N. Ross, and the noted gardener and writer Ruth Isabel Sherrington. He was schooled at St Stephen's School, Dundrum, and Rugby School, before attending Trinity College Dublin, where he graduated with a degree in history and political science in 1971. During his time at Trinity he was the Record Secretary of the College Historical Society. A stockbroker with NCB, Ross was Business Editor of the Sunday Independent, Ireland's biggest- selling weekend broadsheet, until his election to the D√°il in 2011, when he resigned from the post. He is married to Ruth Buchanan, a former presenter and journalist with RT√â, Ireland's national broadcaster. His son-in-law is Nick Webb, who succeeded him as Business Editor of the Sunday Independent. He was first elected to the Seanad in 1981, as an Independent candidate for the University of Dublin constituency, and was re-elected on nine occasions, becoming the longest-serving member of the house. He stood unsuccessfully as an Independent candidate at the 1984 European Parliament election, for the Dublin constituency. At the 1991 local elections, he was elected as a Fine Gael candidate to Wicklow County Council for the Bray local electoral area, and served until 1999. He stood as a candidate for the party in the Wicklow constituency at the 1992 general election, but did not gain a seat, remaining instead in the Seanad where he once again sat as an Independent Senator following the 1997 election. He is one of Ireland's most visible business commentators, promoting free enterprise, small government and low taxes, and is widely identified as one of the most visible champions of laissez-faire capitalism in Irish politics, praising former Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, as a \\"brilliant Minister in the boom years\\" and lauded McCreevy's controversial tax individualisation as \\"visionary\\". He profited from the boom in Irish land prices, selling his home at Carrickmines to a developer in 2004 for an estimated ‚Ç¨4 million to ‚Ç¨4.5 million an acre; however, he subsequently bought a house in Enniskerry, County Wicklow, for ‚Ç¨6.2 million in 2005. Despite labelling himself as one of Ireland's foremost business commentators his record as a stock picker is mixed: as he noted himself, \\"my record when a stockbroker was so bad that Dermot Desmond rightly gave me my P45. ...if any readers are beginning to take me seriously, remember it was I who advised people to sell First Active Shares when they went public and subsequently quadrupled and it was I who told innocent investors not to touch Ryanair shares with a barge pole at the flotation. They rocketed.\\"http://www.shaneross.ie/were-not-on-obamas-radar/ Shareholder activism Ross promotes himself as standing up for small shareholders and consumers. In 2000, he and Eamon Dunphy championed the case of small shareholders of eircom, after shares in the former state-owned company fell in value by more than a third in just over a year. Ross took the board of directors to task over the level of salaries, bonuses and fees being paid, and denounced a plan whereby senior management were to get share options at a value below the flotation price. He was also sharply critical of the decision to sell the mobile phone arm Eircell to Vodafone and later sought the dismissal of 5 board members at the March 2001 AGM, citing poor share price performance and poor acquisitions. At a shareholders' meeting in May 2005, Ross highlighted the monopolistic practices of tolling agency NTR plc. Ross persisted in drawing attention to the issue, criticising the National Roads Authority in August 2008, for its inadequate and confusing management of the M50 barrier-free tolling system, and was reported in The Sunday Times of London as having declared that \\"the removal of the barrier should have been cause for celebration. Instead, we have higher tolls, an administrative mess and pending chaos\\". Stance on corporate governance and cronyism The packaging conglomerate Smurfit Group, small shareholdings in which were held by many Irish investors, has also been a frequent target for Ross, specifically its high executive pay, poor shareholder returns, and alleged nepotism and cronyism. Criticism of Bank of Ireland Prior to the Irish financial crisis he was a persistent critic of the performance of Bank of Ireland, of which he was a shareholder. He contrasted the conservative performance of the \\"establishment\\" Bank of Ireland with other financial institutions, notably Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS) and Anglo Irish Bank (Anglo) which he praised. In his Sunday Independent column he described Michael Fingleton's Irish Nationwide as publishing \\"a cracking set of figures... he even leaves superstar Sean Fitzpatrick's Anglo Irish standing\\", and in another column dismissed shareholder critics of Fingleton, notably Brendan Burgess, and contrasted the small shareholder rebellions of eircom, Smurfit and First Active with that of the INBS, the CEO of which, he claimed, \\"despite all his abrasiveness, was delivering small riches to them\\", Ross dismissed the corporate governance concerns of Fingleton's critics, writing \\"for all his faults, has delivered the only thing that matters in business: profit\\". In his article on Pernod Ricard executive Richard Burrows' appointment as the Governor of the Bank of Ireland, Ross claimed it was mainly due to Burrows' social status as a \\"toff\\" and criticised the bank for not even interviewing the \\"far too dynamic\\" Sean FitzPatrick, then CEO of Anglo Irish Bank. In 2007, Ross praised Sean Quinn's purchase of a stake in \\"anti- establishment Anglo Irish Bank\\" and referred to Quinn as \\"this genius... [who] has combined being a champion of the customer with making a mint\\",http://www.shaneross.ie/sean-quinn-we-salute-you/ describing Quinn Direct as \\"the most successful insurance business in Ireland\\". Anglo Irish Bank revelations In April 2008, Ross revealed that a group of Anglo customers were planning to launch a leveraged fund to buy Anglo shares to \\"squeeze\\" the Anglo \\"short sellers\\" whom Ross blamed for the collapse in the Anglo share price. Ross had been briefed by a member of the group, and quoted him saying \\"We are going to teach the brokers and hedge funds that damaged the bank a salutary lesson... They will come out of this with their fingers burned\\"; the episode became known as the Maple 10 and cost Anglo and ultimately the taxpayer ‚Ç¨451 million. As leverage for the Anglo share purchase was provided by Anglo, this coordinated action would have constituted market abuse. Ross was also a trenchant critic of the under-performance of the Irish Pension Funds, and contrasted their performance with the SVM Global's Saltire Fund, the hedge fund which he chaired; however, in 2013, the Saltire Fund revealed a large loss of 32.4% during a period in which global stock markets had gained 17.7%. Campaigning and political activism In the aftermath of the voters' rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in its first referendum in June 2008, in spite of support for the treaty by the major political parties, Ross highlighted the \\"disconnect\\" between the ruling caste of the nation's politicians and the democratic will of the public. In January 2009, he took the Central Bank of Ireland and Ernst & Young to task for their failings leading up to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank. In his capacity as Senator, Ross pressed Allied Irish Bank executives on the bank's fraudulent offshore dealings involving subsidiaries and Caribbean front operations, charging that the only party to be disciplined in the affair was the whistleblower who brought it to light and forcing from the bank's CEO Eugene Sheehy, the admission that the institution may have been in breach of the Companies Act. He authored an account of the Irish financial crisis later that year ‚Äì The Bankers: How the banks brought Ireland to its knees. In October of that year Ross drew the ire of the public transport company CI√â for publicising charges of widescale fraud and mismanagement within the semi-state organisation. He has criticised government inaction in voicing concerns about the Sellafield nuclear plant, and has called for stronger legal protection for whistleblowers in cases of fraud and corruption. For his investigation into waste at the state training agency F√ÅS pursuant to the F√ÅS expenses scandal, Ross was recognised by his peers as the 2009 Journalist of the Year. Ross is frequently featured as a source by international news media, and has been cited as \\"one of Ireland's foremost financial commentators\\" by the Associated Press. D√°il √âireann On 15 January 2011, during the course of a television interview, Ross announced that he would stand in the Dublin South constituency at the next general election, which at that date had not been announced but was expected very soon. He had refused an offer to run for the resurgent Fine Gael party and become an \\"insignificant backbencher\\", and was determined instead to stand as an Independent candidate, declaring: \\"I think you're going to see in this election a huge number of similar independents who want to put an end to cronyism, who want to see a change in the political system, who want to put an end to Civil War politics in Ireland, who want to see an end to the kind of tribal politics we've got, who are going to stand in the election as well\\". During the general election campaign Fine Gael TD Alan Shatter attacked Ross,Shane Ross, Alan Shatter, Dublin South and the banks saying the Senator \\"was a cheerleader for Sean FitzPatrick and Michael Fingleton\\" and had \\"reserved his criticism of bankers for AIB and Bank of Ireland and celebrated the enormous profits earned by Anglo and Nationwide\\".http://www.businesspost.ie/#!story/Home/News/Shatter+critical+of+Ross+election+claims/id/9631e289-f484-4ed9-9fc5-c30e24b15eac In the election Ross received the second-highest vote in the country, heading the poll in Dublin South with 17,075 votes. In April 2011, Ross claimed the Government was \\"wearing the clothes of the last government of Brian Cowen\\" in its economic policy. He asked why senior bondholders had to be treated in the same way as depositors. \\"They are completely different creatures\\", he said. \\"Senior bondholders go out there and take a risk and make an investment.\\" He claimed that Enda Kenny's greatest cheerleaders in his policy were in Fianna F√°il. \\"The support is coming from the last government\\", he added. \\"And very few people can see the difference, if there is any, between this government and the last government in its attitude to the banks.\\" Ross accused the Government of completely and utterly surrendering to the IMF and the EU. \\"They know that, we know that . . . everybody knows that\\", he said. \\"Default, apparently, is the word which cannot be mentioned in this chamber.\\" In February 2013, Ross spoke in the D√°il against water fluoridation, referring to a Hot Press article he cited Declan Waugh whom he called \\"a well known scientist\\" and claimed fluoridation was the cause of Ireland's \\"high rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes\\". He also claimed that Ireland had double the incidence of Down's syndrome of Northern Ireland as a result. In 2015, Ross co-founded the Independent Alliance. He lost his seat at the 2020 general election. Ministerial career At the 2016 general election he topped the poll in Dublin Rathdown, and was elected. Taoiseach Enda Kenny nominated him as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in May 2016. However, Ross's apparent lack of knowledge of sports in multiple disciplines has been repeatedly observed. He tweeted, \\"Go Katie go!\\", shortly after Finnish boxer Mira Potkonen knocked Katie Taylor out of the 2016 Summer Olympics.https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/banter/trending/bad- connection-means-sports-minister-shane-ross-katie-taylor-tweets-are- illtimed-34968209.html A few days later, after Thomas Barr twice broke the Irish record on his way to finishing fourth in the final of the men's 400 metres hurdles at the same Olympics, Ross instead congratulated a mysterious \\"Thomas Barry\\". During the 2016 Summer Olympics ticket scandal, Ross arrived back from visiting the arrested Olympic Council of Ireland boss Pat Hickey in Rio de Janeiro with a duty-free plastic bag astride his trolley. Following the Ireland national rugby union team's 2018 Six Nations Championship Grand Slam, Ross tweeted a photograph of himself alongside Ireland players Johnny Sexton and Rob Kearney; the photograph's caption stated, \\"Congratulations and welcome home this evening to superstars Johnny Sexton and Dave Kearney\\". Rob Kearney responded to Ross's error by tweeting: \\"You're welcome Leo\\", followed by a wink emoticon. In May 2018, Ross tweeted that he was \\"delighted to confirm\\" that a fee-paying school, Wesley College (located in his constituency), would be given a grant of ‚Ç¨150,000 to resurface its field hockey pitch. Ross was then criticised for announcing increased funding for the Ireland women's national field hockey team following their second place finish at the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup in August 2018, the timing being seen to indicate a publicity stunt on Ross's part. The following month, a statement from Ross congratulated a \\"Dominant Puspure\\" after her gold medal at the 2018 World Rowing Championships. In mid-November 2018, Ross tweeted a photograph of himself inside the stadium celebrating the Ireland rugby union team's victory over the All Blacks in Dublin; the photograph portrayed his tie poking through an open trouser fly.https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/the- corkman/20190606/282402695879818 During a radio interview on Newstalk on 30 November 2018, Ross displayed a lack of knowledge of association football; initially crediting the goalkeeper Shay Given with having scored the winning goal against Germany in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying in October 2015, Ross corrected himself and credited Given with the assist and Shane Long with the goal. The problem, which was not corrected during the interview, was that Given had gone off injured after half an hour and it was his replacement, Darren Randolph, who had provided the famous assist. During the same interview Ross congratulated a \\"Shane Kenny\\" on being appointed manager of the Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team, with the intention of being promoted to the senior job after UEFA Euro 2020.https://www.joe.ie/sport/shane-ross-649936 Publications  ReferencesExternal links * *Shane Ross at the Sunday Independent Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Fine Gael senators Category:Independent members of Seanad √âireann Category:Independent TDs Category:Irish Anglicans Category:Local councillors in County Wicklow Category:Members of Seanad √âireann for the University of Dublin Category:Members of the 15th Seanad Category:Members of the 16th Seanad Category:Members of the 17th Seanad Category:Members of the 18th Seanad Category:Members of the 19th Seanad Category:Members of the 20th Seanad Category:Members of the 21st Seanad Category:Members of the 22nd Seanad Category:Members of the 23rd Seanad Category:Members of the 31st D√°il Category:Members of the 32nd D√°il Category:Ministers for Transport (Ireland) Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Politicians from County Dublin Category:Stockbrokers Category:Sunday Independent (Ireland) people Category:University of Geneva alumni ","title":"Shane Ross"},{"id":"1508635","text":"Mary Elizabeth Frances Henry (born 11 May 1940 in Blackrock, Cork) is a former Irish politician and medical doctor.

He founded the Superquinn supermarket chain and served as a Senator for the National University of Ireland constituency from 1993 to 2016. Early and personal life Quinn was born in Dublin in 1936. His father, Eamonn, founded a grocery brand, and later the Red Island resort in Skerries. He was a first cousin of Labour Party politician Ruairi Quinn and of Lochlann Quinn, former chairman of Allied Irish Banks (AIB). Quinn was educated at Newbridge College and was a commerce graduate of University College Dublin. He was married to Denise, daughter of Ned and Grace Prendergast, and they had five children. He lived in the Baily area of Howth near Dublin, near the former head office of the Superquinn chain at Sutton. Business and public sector career Quinn built a career in business and later took on a range of public service roles. Supermarkets He founded the national supermarket chain, Superquinn (originally Quinn's Supermarkets), of which he remained non-executive president for some years after his family sold out their interest in August 2005 for over ‚Ç¨400 million. Superquinn was known for its focus on customer service and pioneered a number of innovations, including Ireland's first supermarket loyalty card in 1993, SuperClub. It also introduced self-scanning of goods by customers in a number of its outlets. Superquinn became the first supermarket in the world to guarantee the absolute traceability of all its beef from pasture to plate, using TraceBack, a system developed at Trinity College, Dublin by IdentiGEN. Public sector work Quinn became the chairman of the Interim Board for Posts and served as chairman of its successor An Post (the Irish postal administration) until 1989 ‚Äì he also served on several other public authorities and boards.

He was a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs, the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service and was an Oireachtas member of the National Economic and Social Forum, along with the Joint Committee on Jobs and Innovation. During his time in Seanad √âireann he tabled many amendments to government Bills and introduced 17 Private Members Bills. The most successful of those was the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 ‚Äì to protect building sub- contractors which was enacted as the Construction Contracts Act 2013 and was brought into force on 23 July 2016. The proposals contained in several of his other Bills were implemented - for example, in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship and Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2003, Quinn sought to bring an end to the ‚Äòpassports for sale‚Äô scheme. The following year, Quinn‚Äôs proposal was enacted in the form of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004. A further example relates to the Social Welfare and Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2014 ‚Äì a Senator Quinn Bill which sought to remove from Irish Water, the power to require its customers to provide their PPS numbers to the entity. Following the publication of the Bill, the Government announced that it had decided to \\"discontinue\\" the requirement for Irish Water customers to produce their PPS number. The Government subsequently amended the law to mirror Quinn's proposal. Quinn was one of the co-founders and was a driving force behind Democracy Matters ‚Äì a civil society group that was formed to oppose the Government's plans to abolish Seanad √âireann.

The Seanad Bill 2013 succeeded in being passed at Second Stage in the Seanad. During the Seanad abolition referendum campaign, the Bill demonstrated to the electorate, in a very palpable way, that reform of the Seanad was achievable if they voted for its retention. In a referendum held in October 2013 on the Abolition of Seanad √âireann, the people voted to retain the Seanad by 51.7%. In 2014, Quinn revealed that since being first elected to Seanad √âireann, he had donated his entire salary to charity and in more recent years he had refused to accept any salary.

It is known for the manufacture of handmade wooden toys, tiles, its temples and various beautiful architectural monuments on its hills, and its historical background. Idar is at the southern end of the Aravalli Range. Etymology Idar Bus Station Idar was historically named Ilvadurg, which means the fortress of Ilvan. Its name was later corrupted into Idar. It was mentioned in Padma Purana as well as in the Mahabharata as Ila. History Idar in map of Mahi Kantha Agency, British India, 1878 Legends The town is mentioned in Mahabharata and Bhavishottar Puran as 'Ilvadurg'. The exact date of its origin is not known; but it is believed that it came into existence at the time when Yudhishthira was ruling over Hastinapur at the end of the Kurukshetra War of Mahabharata. According to tradition, Idar has been celebrated from the earliest times. Even in the past cycle, yuga, it was known, and in the present cycle, before the days of Vikram, the legendary king Veni Vachh Raj ruled at Idar, the possessor of a golden figure which helped him to build the hillfort and its reservoirs. His queen was a Nagputri, the daughter of a snake-king of the under world, whither, the legend says, she and her consort betook themselves when the queen found that men were mortal. Ancient history The first clear tradition shows Idar in the possession of Bhils. Raja mandlik was King of Ider. After the fall of Vallabhi in 770, Kamalavati or Pushpavati, one of the wives of Maitraka king Shiladitya was at Ambaji to fulfil a vow. She heard news and took refuge in a cave in the mountains and there gave birth to a son called Gruhaditya or 'Goha' or cave-born. Making over the child to a Brahmin woman, the queen followed her husband through the fire. The young prince, of a daring character and adventurous spirit, soon passed out of his guardian's hands, and joining the Idar Bhils was by them chosen king. Whether in sport or earnest, the election was real, and for several generations his successors ruled in Idar. At last Nagaditya or Aparajita the eighth prince was killed by his subjects. He left a son named Bappa Rawal who never succeeded to his father's chiefship, but became the founder of Mewar dynasty. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang (640) mentions a place which he calls O-clia-li, the Chinese way of writing Vadali, a village nearby. British General Cunningham identified this place with Idar. He further noted that in the eleventh century Vadali or Vadari was the capital of a family of chiefs claiming descent from Raja Bhara Gupta, whom the General believed to be the same as the above-mentioned Bappa. According to tradition, Idar was refounded by Parihar Rajputs, who, subject to Chittor, ruled there for several generations. Towards the close of the twelfth century, the Idar chief took part with Prithviraj Chauhan, king of Delhi, against the Ghurid Sultanate and was killed in the Battles of Tarain (1192). Idar then fell into the hands of a Koli king named Hathi Sord who founded the Sord Dynasty and was succeeded by his son Samalio. The latter was killed by a Rathod prince named Sonangji, who took occupied Idar, and became the founder of the dynasty of the Raos who ruled there for several generations. After numerous changes of fortune and many struggles with the Muslims, the Raos had at last to leave Idar, and were, in 1728, succeeded by the Rathod dynasty from Marwar. Modern history Raja Anand Singh, with the help of his brother Rai Singh and a few horseman from Palanpur and the Kolis of Gadhwara, he established himself in Idar without difficulty in 1728 or 1729. He died in 1753. Then HH Maharaja Rajendra Singh became the ruler of princely state of Idar.uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/ips/i/idar.html In 1924 it was made part of the Western India States Agency. It was transferred to the Rajputana states in the early 1940s. In 1949 it was dissolved and split between Sabarkantha and Mehsana districts which were at that point in Bombay State.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer, p. 824 Both these districts became part of Gujarat when it was formed in 1960.

Daytime temperatures are high throughout the year, but nighttime temperatures can dip below in the dry season. Economy Idar is a region which has become a hub for cotton ginning and processing.

Inside of the wall, a road, running round the town, leads to the Gantino Darwajo, a rock-cut passage giving access to the main route to Rajasthan in past. Only a portion of the fortification is present now. Idar clock tower * Clock Tower, the starting of old town * Chaturbhuj Stepwell, an ancient stone stepwell * Idargadh palaces: At the end of the town and immediately under the hill is the palace, a large building with no architectural pretensions. The palace is said to have been built by Maharaja Dowlatsinhji in early twentieth century. Behind the palace, on the south- western face of the range of hills, which joins the Vindhya and Aravalli Range, rises Idargadh, so steep, rocky, and well fortified, that according to the local saying, to take Idargadh is to achieve the impossible. So, a famous folk song was mostly sung in traditional marriages, √Åme √äderio Gadh ƒ¥itya Re Aanand Bhayo (We are very happy that we have conquered Idar Fort). From the palace a steep and easily held pathway leads through more than one gateway and fortified work to the fortress plateau, a table land raised well above the plain surrounded by heights, and with the gaps in the crest filled in and strengthened by ramparts. From below, two buildings, on opposite peaks, attract attention. The other building, on an enormous granite peak to the right, domed and of fine stone, lately smothered with whitewash, is known as the Roothi Rani no Mahel or Angry Queen's Palace. It measures twenty-five feet long by nineteen broad and twelve high. The story is that when Rao Narayanji or Narandas (1573) driven from Idar by Akbar, took refuge in Polo forests, in spite of a terrible ulcer on his back, he continued to harass the Musalmans. One day, when his back was being dressed, his Rani came into the room, and, seeing the fearful sore, mournfully shook her head. Noticing this in a mirror, the Rao asked why she shook her head. She said 'from what I see I have no hope that you will regain your lost throne.' This so annoyed her husband that he left the house, and, afterward, when he retook Idar, he refused to see the Rani's face. Disgusted at this treatment, and unwilling to live in her husband's palace, the Rani had a dwelling built on the highest peak of the hill and there passed the rest of her life. Some centuries after, this palace was the scene of a cruel assassination. Surajmal, Thakor of Chandni who had saved Idar from the Marathas, was so puffed up by his success that he gave great offence, especially to Bhavanisingh the son and heir- apparent of the old Maharaja Shivsingh. Bent on revenge the prince invited Surajmal to a feast, and, under pretence of inspecting the fort, took him up to the Angry Queen's Palace and there killed him. The way into the fort is by a stone paved pathway, the stone slippery and polished from the wear of ages. Passing under more or less ruined gateways the pathway leads to a part of the hill between, and much lower than, the two peaks. *Following the path, on the right hand is a house built by the late Maharaja after a Mount Abu pattern. There are some ruins said to be remains of the Raos' old palace. Further on is a well- preserved freestone. *The Queen's palace is rather difficult to reach, as, besides climbing to the top of the peak, a high smooth narrow granite ridge, unsafe for booted feet, has to bo crossed. * Sheela Udyan, a rock garden * Harishchandra Ki Chouri, where Raja Harishchandra got married * Kharadi Bazaar, the market of toys Main temples Rani Talav with Jain temple in the centre *Sambhavanath Temple : Sambhavanath Temple is a Digambara Jain sect and dedicated to Sambhavanath, the third Tirthankara. This seems of even greater age than the other, but, like it, bears no date. Within the limits of the fort, with a wall and terraces in front, is a natural cavern twenty-eight feet by eighteen and seven high, containing an image of Vajra Mata a goddess worshipped by Hindus of all castes. The whole of the hill is surrounded with more or less ruined fortifications. To the rear are the remains of a fortified gateway, opening on the plain behind, a way of escape for the too hard-pressed defenders of the fort. It was through this gateway that Maharaja Anandsingji fled in 1733 and was attacked and slain by a party of Rehvar horse. The interior of the hill-fort, or rather fortified hill, is very striking from the dense brushwood by which the ruins are more or less hid. Perhaps the finest view is near Shambhavnath's temple, whence, looking towards the Angry Queen's Palace, the sheer scarp of the great granite peak, towering above the trees, stands clear against the sky. *Shantinath Temple:This temple belongs to the Svetambara Jain sect and dedicated to Shantinath, the sixteenth Tirthankara. This temple, measuring 160 feet by 125 and 55 high, is evidently of considerable age, but there is no writing to show its exact date. Near the temple is a deep reservoir always filled with water. * Rani Talav, a lake, half a mile to the north-east of Idar, has an area of ninety-four acres and a greatest depth of seventeen feet. Its supply lasts throughout the year but is used for irrigation. The east side of the lake is banked with masonry steps. It is said, but this is doubtful, to have been dug and built about 380 years ago by the wife of Rao Bhau, chief of Idar. The Pavapuri Jain temple is built recently in the centre of the lake which can be reached by a bridge. The main temple is around 72 feet high, 72 feet long and is built on 72 pillars. The height of central idol of Mahavira is 72 cm which is surrounded by 72 carved figurines.

It was founded by Mitsuo Nagamachi, Professor Emeritus of Hiroshima University (also former Dean of Hiroshima International University and CEO of International Kansei Design Institute). Kansei engineering parametrically links the customer's emotional responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the intended feeling. It has now been adopted as one of the topics for professional development by the Royal Statistical Society. Introduction Product design on today's markets has become increasingly complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. With a shortened product lifecycle, development costs are likely to increase. Since errors in the estimations of market trends can be very expensive, companies therefore perform benchmarking studies that compare with competitors on strategic, process, marketing, and product levels. However, success in a certain market segment not only requires knowledge about the competitors and the performance of competing products, but also about the impressions which a product leaves to the customer. The latter requirement becomes much more important as products and companies are becoming mature. Customers purchase products based on subjective terms such as brand image, reputation, design, impression etc.. A large number of manufacturers have started to consider such subjective properties and develop their products in a way that conveys the company image. A reliable instrument is therefore needed: an instrument which can predict the reception of a product on the market before the development costs become too large. This demand has triggered the research dealing with the translation of the customer's subjective, hidden needs into concrete products. Research is done foremost in Asia, including Japan and Korea. In Europe, a network has been forged under the 6th EU framework. This network refers to the new research field as \\"emotional design\\" or \\"affective engineering\\".  History  Nowadays, people want to use products that are functional at the physical level, usable at the psychological level and attractive at the subjective, emotional level. Affective engineering is the study of the interactions between the customer and the product at that third level. It focuses on the relationships between the physical traits of a product and its affective influence on the user. Thanks to this field of research, it is possible to gain knowledge on how to design more attractive products and make the customers satisfied. Methods in affective engineering (or Kansei engineering) is one of the major areas of ergonomics (human factor engineering ). The study of integrating affective values in artefacts is not new at all. Already in the 18th century philosophers such as Baumgarten and Kant established the area of aesthetics. In addition to pure practical values, artefacts always also had an affective component. One example is jewellery found in excavations from the stone ages. The period of Renaissance is also a good example. In the middle of the 20th century, the idea of aesthetics was deployed in scientific contexts. Charles E. Osgood developed his semantic differential method in which he quantified the peoples' perceptions of artefacts. Some years later, in 1960, Professors Shigeru Mizuno and Yoji Akao developed an engineering approach in order to connect peoples' needs to product properties. This method was called quality function deployment (QFD). Another method, the Kano model, was developed in the field of quality in the early 1980s by Professor Noriaki Kano, of Tokyo University. Kano's model is used to establish the importance of individual product features for the customer's satisfaction and hence it creates the optimal requirement for process oriented product development activities. A pure marketing technique is conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis estimates the relative importance of a product's attributes by analysing the consumer's overall judgment of a product or service. A more artistic method is called Semantic description of environments. It is mainly a tool for examining how a single person or a group of persons experience a certain (architectural) environment. Although all of these methods are concerned with subjective impact, none of them can translate this impact to design parameters sufficiently. This can, however, be accomplished by Kansei engineering. Kansei engineering (KE) has been used as a tool for affective engineering. It was developed in the early 70s in Japan and is now widely spread among Japanese companies. In the middle of the 90s, the method spread to the United States, but cultural differences may have prevented the method to enfold its whole potential. Procedure  As mentioned above, Kansei engineering can be considered as a methodology within the research field of 'affective engineering'. Some researchers have identified the content of the methodology. Shimizu et al. state that 'Kansei Engineering is used as a tool for product development and the basic principles behind it are the following: identification of product properties and correlation between those properties and the design characteristics'. According to Nagasawa, one of the forerunners of Kansei engineering, there are three focal points in the method: # How to accurately understand consumer Kansei # How to reflect and translate Kansei understanding into product design # How to create a system and organization for Kansei orientated design  A model on methodology  In Japanese publications, different types of Kansei engineering are identified and applied in various contexts. Sch√ºtte examined different types of Kansei engineering and developed a general model covering the contents of Kansei engineering. ; Choice of Domain Domain in this context describes the overall idea behind an assembly of products, i.e. the product type in general. Choosing the domain includes the definition of the intended target group and user type, market-niche and type, and the product group in question. Choosing and defining the domain are carried out on existing products, concepts and on design solutions yet unknown. From this, a domain description is formulated, serving as the basis for further evaluation. The process is necessary and has been described by Sch√ºtte in detail in a couple of publications. ; Span the Semantic Space The expression Semantic Space was addressed for the first time by Osgood et al.. He posed that every artifact can be described in a certain vector space defined by semantic expressions (words). This is done by collecting a large number of words that describe the domain. Suitable sources are pertinent literature, commercials, manuals, specification list, experts etc. The number of the words gathered varies according to the product, typically between 100 and 1000 words. In a second step the words are grouped using manual (e.g. Affinity diagram, compare: Bergman and Klefsj√∂, 1994) or mathematical methods (e.g. factor and/or cluster analysis, compare: Ishihara et al., 1998). Finally a few representing words are selected from this spanning the Semantic Space. These words are called \\"Kansei words\\" or \\"Kansei Engineering words\\". ; Span the Space of Properties The next step is to span the Space of Product Properties, which is similar to the Semantic Space. The Space of Product Properties collects products representing the domain, identifies key features and selects product properties for further evaluation. The collection of products representing the domain is done from different sources such as existing products, customer suggestions, possible technical solutions and design concepts etc. The key features are found using specification lists for the products in question. To select properties for further evaluation, a Pareto-diagram (compare Bergman and Klefsj√∂, 1994) can assist the decision between important and less important features. Synthesis In the synthesis step, the Semantic Space and the Space of Properties are linked together, as displayed in Figure 3. Compared to other methods in Affective Engineering, Kansei engineering is the only method that can establish and quantify connections between abstract feelings and technical specifications. For every Kansei word a number of product properties are found, affecting the Kansei word. ; Synthesis The research into constructing these links has been a core part of Nagamachi's work with Kansei engineering in the last few years. Nowadays, a number of different tools is available. Some of the most common tools are : * Category Identification * Regression Analysis /Quantification Theory Type I * Rough Sets Theory * Genetic Algorithm * Fuzzy Sets Theory ; Model building and Test of Validity After doing the necessary stages, the final step of validation remains. This is done in order to check if the prediction model is reliable and realistic. However, in case of prediction model failure, it is necessary to update the Space of Properties and the Semantic Space, and consequently refine the model. The process of refinement is difficult due to the shortage of methods. This shows the need of new tools to be integrated. The existing tools can partially be found in the previously mentioned methods for the synthesis. Software tools Kansei engineering has always been a statically and mathematically advanced methodology. Most types require good expert knowledge and a reasonable amount of experience to carry out the studies sufficiently. This has also been the major obstacle for a widespread application of Kansei engineering. In order to facilitate application some software packages have been developed in the recent years, most of them in Japan. There are two different types of software packages available: User consoles and data collection and analysis tools. User consoles are software programs that calculate and propose a product design based on the users' subjective preferences (Kanseis). However, such software requires a database that quantifies the connections between Kanseis and the combination of product attributes. For building such databases, data collection and analysis tools can be used. This part of the paper demonstrates some of the tools. There are many more tools used in companies and universities, which might not be available to the public. User consoles  Software  As described above, Kansei data collection and analysis is often complex and connected with statistical analysis. Depending on which synthesis method is used, different computer software is used. Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) uses QT1 for linear analysis. The concept of Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) Link√∂ping University in Sweden. The software generates online questionnaires for collection of Kansei raw-data Another software package (Kn6) was developed at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain. Both software packages improve the collection and evaluation of Kansei data. In this way even users with no specialist competence in advanced statistics can use Kansei engineering.

The regression models can be viewed in some cases as substitutes for the Kalman filter when applied in the context of mixed frequency data. Bai, Ghysels and Wright (2010) examine the relationship between MIDAS regressions and Kalman filter state space models applied to mixed frequency data. In general, the latter involve a system of equations, whereas in contrast MIDAS regressions involve a (reduced form) single equation. As a consequence, MIDAS regressions might be less efficient, but also less prone to specification errors. In cases where the MIDAS regression is only an approximation, the approximation errors tend to be small.

Where normal mouse control uses single-click for selection and double-click to open/edit/etc, the xmouse system automatically selects objects after hovering the mouse over the object for a certain period of time (often one second). The context function, previously activated by double-clicking, is activated by single-clicking. Double-clicking is made redundant by this system and is ignored. Operation of menus, text selection and other features remain unchanged. Proponents of the xmouse system claim it has many advantages over the regular system of selection. Most notably, it requires much less effort on the part of the user to use the computer, and can be considerably faster once users have adjusted to the non-standard interface. The two main disadvantages are the selection speed, and the non-standardness of the xmouse system. Firstly, if the activated window is also configured to be drawn into foreground there must be a minimum time for the cursor to hover over a window before it is selected, or else all touched windows would be immediately in foreground and cover other windows. This 'lag time' reduces the maximum speed that xmouse can be used at, and could lead to annoying pauses. Secondly, as it is rarely used in the world, people who get used to the xmouse system might find it hard to adjust to using other computers, and vice versa. On Microsoft Windows, an Xmouse Control Panel applet was available as part of the Windows 95 PowerToys, used to configure focusing windows in the user interface by hovering.

The main settlement in the parish is Castletown. Prior to the 19th century, the parish was sub-divided into ten townlands or \\"fermlands\\". Townland boundaries were mostly disregarded and lost during the agricultural improvements in the 19th century, but many townland names remain identifiable with farmstead names ending with Mains. Early history The name Olrig (or Olrick) is thought to signify ‚Äúthe son of Erick,‚Äù from one of the Norwegian chieftains prominent in the locale following the invasion of Caithness by the King of Norway at the beginning of the ninth century. The Danes invaded Olrig at a distant period, landing at the bay of Murkle but were defeated by the inhabitants in a conflict on a height called, from the slain, Morthill, which is the origin of the name Murkle. There are numerous Pictish houses in the parish, and a nunnery is said to have been located on the lands of Murkle, its site perhaps being marked by a small burn called Closters, a corruption of the word cloisters. At the top of the hill of Olrick are the remains of an ancient watchtower, and it is believed that a church called St. Coomb‚Äôs Kirk once stood near the eastern boundary of the parish. Its name is derived from its probable dedication to St. Columba. This church is supposed to have been the church of the united parishes of Olrig and Dunnet. There is a tradition that the kirk and the adjoining manse disappeared overnight when they were suddenly overwhelmed by a sandstorm, but ‚Äúthere is no trace of any structure in an area of consolidated sand dunes.‚Äù Sinclairs of Olrig Members of Clan Sinclair became associated with Olrig in the mid- seventeenth century. They were as follows: *George Sinclair, the fifth son of Sir James Sinclair of Canisbay. *Alexander Sinclair, the son of George. He was killed in a duel in 1710 by William Innes of Sandside. *Donald Sinclair of Olrig and Bilbster, son of Alexander. *Charles Sinclair, the son of Donald. *Donald Sinclair, the son of Charles. He died without issue on 9 March 1722. *Fenella Sinclair, the sister of Donald, who married Archibald Cullen. She sold the lands of Olrig and Bilbster. Myths and legends Various legends and folk tales are associated with the parish. Versions of these two tales appear in James Traill Calder's History of Caithness 1887 (pages 55 to 61, as republished 1973 by Stansfield, Fortrose). The hillock and well of Sysa figure in both. According to Calder, the well dried up as a result of 19th century agricultural improvements. The hillock is still there, on the south side of Olrig Hill (). The words of Dorrad, in the first tale, are re-quoted from The Raven Banner (page 19) by Ian Cassells, Thurso, circa 1995. *See also the Stone Lud Dorrad's vision at Sysa, 1014 At the time of Clontarf, the 1014 battle near Dublin, Caithness was ruled as a part of the Norwegian earldom of Orkney. At Clontarf Earl Sigurd the Stout of Orkney made a bid to become High King of Ireland, in battle with Brian Boru, the established High King. Both Brian and Sigurd died in the battle. Sigurd's bid had been invited by Sigtrygg Silkbeard, the Norse King of Dublin. Sigtrygg survived and prospered. The battle was fought on Good Friday and, in legend, on the same Good Friday, a Norse poet called Daraddus or Dorrad had a vision, an apparition of the Valkyries, twelve in all, on horseback at Sysa. They seemed to ride into the hillock. Daraddus himself approached the hillock and found an opening in its side. When he peered inside he saw the Valkyries were weaving a cloth and singing. Daraddus recorded what he heard and saw: :Blood rains from cloudy web on the broad loom of slaughter. The web of man, grey as armor, is now woven. The Valkyries will cross it with a crimson weft :The warp is made of human entrails. Human heads are used as weights. The heddle rods are blood- wet spears. The shafts are iron-bound, and arrows are the shuttles. With swords we shall weave this web of battle. :The Valkyries go weaving with drawn swords, Hild and Hjorthrimul, Sangrid and Svipul. Spears will shatter. Shields will splinter. Swords will gnaw like wolves through armour. :Let us now wind the web of war which the young King once waged. Let us advance and wade through the ranks, where friends of ours are exchanging blows. :Let us now wind the web of war and then follow the king to battle. Gunn and Gondul can see there the blood-splattered shields that guarded the King. :Let us now wind the web of war where the warrior‚Äôs banners are forging forward. Let his life not be taken. Only the Valkyries can choose the slain. :Lands will be ruled by new people who once inhabited outlying headlands. We pronounce a great King destined to die. Now an Earl is felled by spears. :The men of Ireland will suffer a grief that will never grow old in the minds of men. The web is now woven and the battlefield reddened. The news of disaster will spread through lands. :It is horrible now to look around, as blood-red cloud darkens the sky. The heavens are stained with the blood of men, as the Valkyries sing their song. We sang well victory songs for the young king. Hail to our singing! Let him who listens to our Valkyrie song learn it well and tell it to others. Let us ride our horses hard on bare backs, away from here, with swords unsheathed. When the bloody cloth was woven the Valkyries tore it into twelve pieces. Each took a piece and remounted her horse. Then the twelve rode furiously away, six to the north and six to the south. The Piper of Windy Ha Again at Sysa, one sunny tranquil day in the leafy month of June, a cowboy called Peter Water stopped to drink and linger at the well, while on his way home to Windy Ha. He rested and slept till near sunset, when he was awakened by a touch on his shoulder. A young lady was beside him, dressed in green, her eyes blue and her hair in golden ringlets. Peter was bashful and felt himself blushing. \\"I have come to make a man of you\\" the lady said. Peter mistook her meaning and demurred. She laughed and continued with her offer: \\"I will put you in the way of rising in the world and making your fortune\\" she said, and she asked Peter to choose between a book and a pipe. Both were magical. In the book Peter saw the status and fortunes of a popular preacher. In the pipe he saw those of a popular musician. He was attracted by both but, though he had never fingered a pipe before, the pipe is what he chose. He found he could play the pipe immediately, and play it well. One condition was attached to the lady's gift: that he swear by the well to return in moonlight on the same evening seven years hence. Peter promised that if alive he would do so. Peter was soon a popular and prosperous musician, growing in fame and fortune throughout the next seven years. He was true to his word and returned to the well of Sysa in the moonlight on the same evening, seven years hence. Peter has never been seen since, but still his pipe is sometimes heard in Olrig. (The skeptics, however, attribute the sound to the wind playing though the radio masts on top of the hill.)

The service designation MiG-5 was reserved for the production version of the aircraft. Competing designs in the USSR included the Grushin Gr-1, Polikarpov TIS and Tairov Ta-3. It was intended to develop reconnaissance and bomber versions but these plans were disrupted by Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion in June 1941. The project failed due to its disappointing Mikulin AM-37 engines and when a second prototype was built with M-82 radial engines its performance was mediocre. The design was cancelled in 1943 after at least two prototypes had been built. Design and development The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti‚ÄîPeople's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry) requested on 7 October 1940 that the OKO (opytno-konstrooktorskiy otdel‚ÄîExperimental Design Department) of Factory (Zavod) No. 1, which would later become the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau (OKB) begin work on a twin- engined long-range, single-seat escort fighter intended to use the AM-37 engine, then under development by Mikulin. It also requested that specifications, along with a model, be ready to be discussed on 12 November of that year. Three days later Mikoyan and Gurevich were ordered to produce three prototypes to undergo State acceptance trials on 1 August, 1 September and 1 November 1941. After the meeting, the NKAP broadened its roles to include bombing, torpedo attack, reconnaissance and interdiction. A low-wing, twin- engined, twin-tailed monoplane, the DIS was of mixed construction. The front section was built from duralumin, the middle section was a wooden monocoque and the rear section was steel tubes covered with a duralumin skin. The twin tails were wooden and had an electrically operated variable-incidence horizontal stabilizer. The elevators had duralumin frames, but were covered by fabric. The two-spar wing was made in three pieces. The center section was metal, but the outer panels were wooden with fabric-covered ailerons and veneer-covered Schrenk flaps. The wing had leading edge slats along two-thirds of its length. The main undercarriage retracted rearwards into the rear of the engine nacelles and the tailwheel retracted into the rear fuselage. The Mikulin AM-37 inline engines were slung underneath the wings with the engine oil coolers mounted in the outer wing panels. The air intakes for the engine superchargers were located in the wing leading edge. The pilot was provided with a glass panel on the underside of the nose to improve his downward visibility, and he was protected by armor up to thick at the front, rear, sides and underside of his seat. The fuel capacity was in two protected tanks behind the pilot, and another four in the wings.Gunston, p. 179 The DIS was intended to be armed with a VYa cannon with 200 rounds in a pod beneath the nose, but the VVS preferred the Taubin MP-6 cannon. The DIS was to carry two of them with 120 rounds per gun, but they proved to be a failure and the aircraft reverted to the original VYa cannon. Each wing root was to have a synchronized Berezin UBS machine gun with 300 rounds mounted below a pair of ShKAS machine guns with 1000 rounds per gun. The gun pod could be removed and bombs up to or a torpedo could be carried instead. Flight testing The first prototype, with the internal designation of T, made its first flight on 11 June 1941. Its initial flight tests, conducted by the manufacturer between 1 July and 5 October, were a disappointment as it could reach only a speed of at , slower than estimated. The three-bladed AV-5L-114 propellers were exchanged for four-bladed AV-9B-L-149 propellers and the engine installation was redesigned, after wind tunnel tests by TsAGI (Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute), which revealed that the poorly designed engine accessories were the major cause of the excess drag. After modifications, the aircraft reached at an altitude of . Its time to was 5.5 minutes. Even with the improvements the LII (Lyotno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot‚ÄîFlight Research Institute) did not recommend production, but recommended that development and testing should continue. The German advance on Moscow in October 1941 forced the Institute and the DIS to evacuate to Kazan while the OKO and its factory went to Kuibyshev. The failure of the AM-37 to enter production doomed the project, albeit temporarily.Gordon, pp. 126, 128 The OKO, along with all other aircraft designers, had been directed to use the Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine as a backup engine for their products in May 1941, but the evacuation disrupted the production of this version, known internally as the IT and it was not built until the autumn of 1942. Aside from the engines, it differed from the T in small respects. Its tailcone was split vertically to use as an air brake and the armament was revised to consist of two VYa cannon in the undernose pod with 150 rounds each and four Berezin UBK machine guns mounted in the wing roots. It made its first flight on 28 January 1943 and demonstrated a top speed of and a time to 5,000 meters of 6.3 minutes. Flight testing was stopped on 10 February when the floatless carburetors had to be sent to TsIAM (Tsentrahl'nyy Institoot Aviatsionnovo Motorostroyeniya‚ÄîCentral Institute of Aviation Motors) for adjustment. There were continuous problems with these and they delayed the entire project until it was cancelled in October 1943. The service designation MiG-5 was reserved for the production version of this aircraft, as demonstrated in the NKAP order of 2 October 1941, which instructed Zavod No. 1 to begin manufacture of the MiG-5 after the completion of its State acceptance tests. Other known designations for the aircraft include the DIS-200 and Idzeliye 71, its factory designation. The bomber version, if it had entered production, might have been known as the MiG-2. Two prototypes are known to have been built, but some records suggest that others were also built. The original order called for three aircraft and was amended later for two additional aircraft with M-82 engines. Some sources quote dates for the latter version's first flight of January 1942 and 15 October 1941, which could be an indication that two of the latter version were completed, or they could simply be clerical errors.Gordon, pp. 129‚Äì30 Variants * DIS ‚Äì basic designation * DIS-T ‚Äì initial prototype with 2 √ó Mikulin AM-37 inline engines with 1,400 hp each. * DIS-IT ‚Äì second prototype with 2 √ó Shvetsov M-82F radial engines with 1,700 hp each; other subtle revisions added to improved performance. * MiG-5 ‚Äì reserved Soviet Air Forces designation for production-quality aircraft (not used).

Cooper and Cedric Fauntleroy, fighting in the Polish Air Force. Polish 7th Air Escadrille emblem Insignia of the 303 Polish Squadron, during World War II, would be identical with that of the Ko≈õciuszko Squadron. The 303 Squadron honour badge had \\"303\\" added to the original Ko≈õciuszko Squadron emblem. Polish 7th Air Escadrille (), better known as the Ko≈õciuszko Squadron, was one of the units of the Polish Air Force during the Polish- Soviet War of 1919-1921. Formed in late 1918, it was re-formed in late 1919 from US volunteers. It was one of the most active Polish squadrons in the war. Operational history The unit was formed when Poland regained independence, on 7 November 1918 in Krak√≥w, as the 3rd Air Escadrille, utilizing mostly bomber and reconnaissance aircraft left by Austro-Hungarian forces. On 25 November 1918 it was moved to Lw√≥w (current Lviv), where it took active part in fighting of the Polish-Ukrainian War until June 1919. On 21 December 1918, after unification of Polish air units' names, its name was changed to the 7th Air Escadrille. It was commanded by Jerzy Boreysza, from April 1919 by Stefan Stec. Among pilots was World War I Ace Mieczys≈Çaw Garsztka and Harvard graduate Edmund Pike Graves. Number of aircraft was variable, in May 1919 it possessed 3 fighters Fokker D.VIII (E.V), 3 reconnaissance Hansa-Brandenburg C.I and 1 LVG C.V. In June 1919 the escadrille was converted into fighter unit, then in September it was withdrawn into reserve. In October 1919 the commander became Ludomi≈Ç Rayski. In late 1919 eight American volunteers, including Major Cedric Fauntleroy and Captain Merian C. Cooper, arrived in Poland from France where in September 1919 they had been officially named the Ko≈õciuszko Squadron (after the Polish American hero Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko) with Major Fauntleroy as its commander. After reaching Poland the men from Ko≈õciuszko Squadron joined the 7th Squadron. More pilots arrived during the following weeks - in all, there served 21 American pilots, along with several Polish pilots, including Ludwik Idzikowski, the ground crew was all Polish. In November 1919 Major Fauntleroy took the command and on 31 December 1919 the escadrille took the name Ko≈õciuszko Squadron. Meanwhile, the Polish Air Force underwent reorganization. Even though most volunteers asked to be sent to the frontlines as soon as possible, the Polish high command delayed their deployment in view of the coming Polish offensive. The Ko≈õciuszko Squadron was the first air squadron to use a railway train as a mobile flying base with specially designed railroad cars that could transport their aircraft as the front moved and developed. The train also included the squadron's operational headquarters, aircraft spares and repair workshops and living quarters. The Ko≈õciuszko Squadron was first used in the Kiev Offensive in April 1920, rebasing from Lw√≥w to Po≈Çonne. Its aircraft were Albatros D.III (Oef) fighters, supplemented by Ansaldo A.1 Balilla. Since there were no air encounters, primary missions became reconnaissance and ground attack. Most of the Squadron's flights were directed against Semyon Budionny's First Cavalry Army. The Squadron developed a tactic of low-altitude machine-gun strafing runs. Polish land commanders highly valued the contribution of the Ko≈õciuszko Squadron. General Puchucki of the 13th Infantry Division wrote in a report: \\"The American pilots, though exhausted, fight tenaciously. During the last offensive, their commander attacked enemy formations from the rear, raining machine-gun bullets down on their heads. Without the American pilots' help, we would long ago have been done for.\\" Merian Cooper was shot down but survived. Budionny had put half a million rubles on Captain Cooper's head, but when he was caught by the Cossacks he managed to convince them that he was a corporal. A few months later he escaped from a POW camp near Moscow to Latvia. In August 1920 the Ko≈õciuszko Squadron took part in the defense of Lw√≥w, and after the Battle of Warsaw it participated in the Battle of Komar√≥w which crippled Budionny's cavalry. Most active days were August 16 and 17, when Escadrille, reduced to 5 uninjured pilots, fulfilled 18 ground attack missions each day. After the Polish-Soviet War, in 1925 the 7th Ko≈õciuszko Squadron was reorganized as the 121st Fighter Squadron, eventually renamed as the Polish 111th Fighter Escadrille, each bearing the \\"Ko≈õciuszko\\" eponym. The 111th Squadron fought in the Invasion of Poland. Perhaps the most famous successor to the original Ko≈õciuszko Squadron would be the World War II No. 303 \\"Ko≈õciuszko\\" Polish Fighter Squadron (Warszawski im. Tadeusza Ko≈õciuszki), the most successful fighter squadron in the Battle of Britain.  Squadron statistics  Faunt-le-Roy i jego eskadra w Polsce : dzieje Eskadry Ko≈õciuszki book cover In 1920 the Ko≈õciuszko Squadron made over 400 combat flights. Colonel Cedric E. Fauntleroy and Lt.- Col. Merian C. Cooper received Poland's highest military decoration: the Virtuti Militari. Other Kociuszko Squadron recipients of the Virtuti Militari included Major George M.

Design  A member of the Home Guard demonstrates a Lee-Enfield rifle equipped to fire an anti-tank grenade, Dorking, 3 August 1942. British research into shaped charges in the inter-war period brought about some useful progress but did not result in any weapons. Development of the grenade started in late 1939, after a demonstration arranged for a British military commission of a series of anti-tank rifle grenades and artillery warheads at the Swiss Army Proving Ground at Thun in Switzerland, which had been designed by Henry Mohaupt. Guessing that Mauhaupt's weapons were using the hollow charge principle, the British abandoned negotiations and began development of a rifle grenade based on their own previous work. The No. 68 has some claim to have been the first high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) device in use. The design of the warhead was simple and was capable of penetrating 52 mm (2 inches) of armour.R F Eather, BSc & N Griffithe, OBE MSc - Some Historical Aspects of the Development of Shaped Charges - Ministry of Defence, Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment - 1984 - page 6 - AD-A144 098 The fuze of the grenade was armed by removing a pin in the tail which prevented the firing pin from flying forward. The grenade was launched from a rifle cup. The simple fins gave it some stability in the air and, provided the grenade hit the target at the proper angle (90 degrees), the charge would be effective. Detonation occurred on impact, when a striker in the tail of the grenade overcame the resistance of a creep spring and was thrown forward into a stab detonator.Hogg, Ian V. (1977) The Encyclopedia of Infantry Weapons of World War II, Arms & Armour Press. The grenade was fired, as was the No 36M Mills bomb, from a specially adapted Lee-Enfield Rifle No 1 EY, often converted from a rifle that was unfit for general use and had been marked \\"DP\\" for drill purpose. The \\"EY\\" suffix (for \\"EmergencY\\") indicated that it should be used to fire standard \\"ball\\" ammunition only in an emergency situation. The converted rifles were strengthened by the addition of an additional bolt to secure the breech mechanism to the stock, and a cord binding was fastened around the forestock. A special Ballistite high explosive cartridge was required to propel the grenade. The grenade itself was held in place by the 2¬Ω inch discharger cup No 1 Mk I. With the weapon's introduction into Home Guard use, the Adaptor No. 1 and the Discharger No 2 Mk I were introduced, which allowed grenades to be launched from the M1917 Enfield rifle with which they were equipped, although a contemporary manual warned that rifles used for that purpose were likely to be \\"somewhat spoilt as a precision weapon\\".  Service  The No. 68 grenade entered service with the British Army in November 1940. However, it proved to be not much better than the inadequate Boys anti-tank rifle and could not be improved as the size of the explosive charge was limited by the diameter of the discharger cup. It was introduced into service with the Home Guard in February 1941 and was retained until the force stood-down in 1944.  References  External links  * The Home Guard Pocket Manual, by Capt. A.

The former army major, who had been a Cabinet Minister, resigned his seat to take up the position of Governor of Bermuda in late 1972. His murder would result in the last executions to be conducted under British rule anywhere in the world. Career Sharples passed out from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in 1936 and was commissioned into the Welsh Guards. He married Pamela Newall in 1946; they had two sons and two daughters. The family greatly enjoyed yachting, and this was the basis of a close friendship with Edward Heath, later prime minister. Sharples was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Sutton and Cheam in a 1954 by-election. After the 1970 general election, he served as Minister of State at the Home Office, before resigning his seat in 1972 to take up the position of Governor of Bermuda. He was assassinated in 1973 by a faction associating itself with the Black Power movement. His widow was subsequently made a life peer as Baroness Sharples. Assassination The graves of Sharples and Sayers in the cemetery of St Peter's Church Sharples was killed outside Bermuda's Government House on the evening of 10 March 1973. An informal dinner party for a small group of guests had just concluded, when he decided to go for a walk with his Great Dane, Horsa, and his aide-de-camp, Captain Hugh Sayers of the Welsh Guards. The two men and dog were ambushed and gunned down outside the Governor's residence. The Governor's coffin was borne by officers of the Bermuda Regiment, and Sayers' by a party from the Welsh Guards. The coffins were carried atop 25-pounder field guns of the Bermuda Regiment, to the , which was stationed at HM Dockyard Bermuda at the time. The ship's Royal Marines detachment provided an honour guard on the flight deck. HMS Sirius conveyed the bodies from Hamilton to St. George's, where they were interred at St. Peter's Church. After the assassination HMS Sirius provided enhanced security for Senior Naval Officer West Indies (SNOWI) who was stationed on the island. A detachment of Royal Marines (subsequently replaced by soldiers from the Parachute Regiment) was posted to the Dockyard to guard SNOWI.Guarding SNOWI, by Mick Pinchen, Royal Marine Sharples was buried in the graveyard at St Peter's Church in St George's on 16 March 1973, six days after his assassination, with Captain Sayers and Great dane, Horsa. Elements of the British Army's airborne forces, which were training at Warwick Camp with the Bermuda Regiment at the time of the murders, were called in to assist the civil authorities. The 23 Parachute Field Ambulance, 1 Parachute Logistic Regiment and the band of the 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment subsequently provided protection for government buildings, officials and dignitaries as well as assisting the Bermuda Police. Police launched a massive manhunt and investigation. Eventually, in 1973, an armed man named Erskine Durrant \\"Buck\\" Burrows was arrested. He confessed to shooting dead Sharples and Sayers. At his trial he was also convicted of murdering the Bermuda Police commissioner George Duckett on 9 September 1972 and killing the co-owner and the bookkeeper of a supermarket in April 1973. He was sentenced to death. In his confession Burrows wrote: A co-accused named Larry Tacklyn was acquitted of assassinating Sharples and Sayers but was convicted of killing Victor Rego and Mark Doe at the Shopping Centre supermarket in April 1973. Unlike Burrows, who did not care whether he was to be executed, Tacklyn expected to get a \\"last minute\\" reprieve. Both murderers remained in Casemates Prison while the appeals process for Tacklyn was brought before the Privy Council in London. During this time, it was reported that Tacklyn passed the time playing table tennis, while Burrows took a virtual vow of silence, only communicating his thoughts and requests on scraps of paper. Both men were hanged on 2 December 1977 at Casemates Prison. A moratorium on hanging was then in effect, and, although others had been sentenced to death in the intervening years, no one had been executed in Bermuda since the Second World War. Burrows and Tacklyn would be the last people to be executed under British rule anywhere in the world. Three days of rioting followed the executions. During the riots, the Bermuda Regiment proved too small to fulfill its role (which was considered by Major General Glyn Gilbert, the highest ranking Bermudian in the British Army, in his review of the regiment, leading to its increase from 400 soldiers to a full battalion of 750). As a consequence, at the request of the Bermuda Government, soldiers of the 1st Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers were flown in as re-inforcements in the aftermath of the riots. The cost of the damages was estimated to be $2 million.Bermuda Online: British Army in Bermuda from 1701 to 1977 NotesSources The Ottawa Citizen, 11 March 1973,**as first reported.** *'The Black Panthers: Their Dangerous Bermudian Legacy The Black Panthers: Their Dangerous Bermudian Legacy, Mel Ayton 2006.

History Tombs of Ustad in Nakodar Tomb at Nakodar The town is of considerable antiquity and had been held in succession by three different races, the Arain, Jatts, Kambojs, and then by the muslim Rajputs, traces of whom still exist in the extensive ruins by which the town is surrounded. The town was anciently founded by the Hindu Kamboh, according to Sir William Wilson Hunter and others.Punjab gazetteers, 1883, bound in 10 vols., without title-leaves, 1883, p. 159, PunjabPunjab District Gazetteers, 1970, p. 496, Punjab (India).Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1886, p. 180, Sir William Wilson Hunter.Gazetteer Jalandhar, First Edition, 1980, Chapter XIX, Places of Interest .Encyclopedia of Jalandhar: Jalandhar, 2004, p. 38, Harajindar Si·πÖgha Dilagƒ´r. The Kamboh settlements lay to the west of present town and the sites are still marked by extensive ruins and two old fine tombs, now called the Black and Red Domes, from the color of the material. Tradition attributes the Kamboh expulsion to the Nawab Kutb Khan who came with an army from Indor near Nuh in 1570 AD. As a consequence, the lordship of the town thus passed over to the Khanzadaas from the Kamboj tribe. Within two generations, the Rajputs got the town in jagir from Emperor Jahangir, in later sixteenth century, apparently divesting the Khanzadahs, the successor race to the Kambohs. The Rajputs were themselves later ousted during Sikh period by one Sardar Tara Singh Ghaiba who made a fort and made himself the master of the surroundings. From Ghaiba, the town was seized by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1816. Geography Nakodar is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc ‚Äì Nakodar It has an average elevation of 223 metres (731 feet).

In that case, the German supreme command of the armed forces (OKW ‚Äì Oberkommando Wehrmacht) was acquitted of the charge of having been a criminal organization. These twelve trials were all held before U.S. military courts, not before the International Military Tribunal, but took place in the same rooms at the Palace of Justice. The twelve U.S. trials are collectively known as the \\"Subsequent Nuremberg Trials\\" or, more formally, as the \\"Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals\\" (NMT). Background High Command Trial courtroom The accused in this trial were high-ranking generals of the German Wehrmacht (including three field marshals and a former admiral), some of whom had been members of the High Command of Nazi Germany's military forces. They were charged with having participated in or planned or facilitated the execution of the numerous war crimes and atrocities committed in countries occupied by the German forces during the war. The judges in this case, heard before Military Tribunal V-A, were the American John C. Young (presiding judge), Winfield B. Hale, and Justin W. Harding. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Telford Taylor. The indictment was filed on November 28, 1947; the trial lasted from December 30 that year until October 28, 1948. Of the 14 defendants indicted, two were acquitted on all counts. Johannes Blaskowitz committed suicide during the trial. The remaining defendants received prison sentences ranging from three years including time served to lifetime imprisonment.  Indictment  The accused faced four charges of having committed war crimes and crimes against humanity: # Crimes against peace by waging aggressive war against other nations and violating international treaties. # War crimes by being responsible for murder, ill-treatment and other crimes against prisoners of war and enemy belligerents. # Crimes against humanity by participating or ordering the murder, torture, deportation, hostage-taking, etc. of civilians in military-occupied countries. # Participating and organizing the formulations and execution of a common plan and conspiracy to commit aforementioned crimes. All defendants were indicted on all counts; they all pleaded \\"not guilty\\". Count 4 of the indictment‚Äîthe conspiracy charge‚Äîwas soon dropped by the tribunal because it was already covered by the other charges. On count 1, the tribunal considered all accused not guilty, stating that they were not the policy-makers and that preparing for war and fighting a war on orders was not a criminal offense under the applicable international law of the time.  Defendants and judgements The accused were, with respect to each charge, either indicted but not convicted (I) or indicted and found guilty (G), as listed below by defendant, charge, and eventual outcome.

German leverage increased as the urgency of rearming Germany grew. Under these intense pressures, in 1950, U.S. High Commissioner John McCloy established a review panel chaired by Judge David Peck of New York and, on its recommendation, reduced the sentences of three of the six High Command defendants still in prison. After further proceedings by mixed commissions composed of Allied and German members, the last of the High Command defendants returned home in 1953.See Detlev F.

It is managed by the Forestry Commission and to promote biodiversity, and is also commercially exploited for timber products. The eastern third of the forest, an area of 159.6 hectares, is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Description In 2005, a tree top forest walk was constructed which has attracted many visitors and rises through the forest to a height of about 15 metres (49 ft), at a gradient not exceeding 1 in 12. At the end, a raised viewing platform sits above it at 18 metres (59 ft) from the ground, which is accessed by stairs. Northampton town can be seen from the top of the final tower. In May 2018 the raised walkway was closed to the public following health and safety reasons.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-47659234 The project was placed first in the Environmental category of the British Construction Industry Awards 2006. There is a similar but longer raised walkway at Kew Gardens. There are public footpaths through the forest and a range of wildlife can be observed. The forest is a remnant of the medieval royal hunting forest. Reminders of the past can still be found, with several miles of ancient woodland, building remains and ancient trees. The 'druids' or veteran oaks in Salcey are rare and distinct wildlife habitats, and some of the veteran oaks are believed to be over 500 years old.

It is an official Bookcrossingzone and has two bookshelves where books can be left or taken for free. The cafe closes at 16.00 hours in the winter, and the park itself at 17.00 hours. During the Second World War, elephants from circuses were put to use to fell trees. There is a pond named The Elephant Pond where the elephants could bathe at the end of the day. The forest was served by its own railway station on the Stratford- upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway until 1908.

Holme was one of the Valiant Sixty, a group of early leaders and activists in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Life Holme was born in Lancashire, England, on November 3, 1624, to a yeoman named George and his wife Alice (n√©e Whiteside). He married Sarah Croft in 1649, and soon enlisted in the army under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, where he attained the rank of captain. It may have been in the army that he gained some experience in surveying. After retiring he was granted more than 4,000 acres (16 km¬≤) in County Wexford, Ireland, which was then under the control and colonization of England. At some point he joined the Quaker movement in Ireland, reputedly converted by George Fox, founder of the sect. There he met fellow Quaker William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. In 1682, Penn wrote to Holme from the colony asking him to come be his surveyor, since his original surveyor, Captain William Crispin, had recently become ill and died on the voyage to America. Shortly thereafter, Holme, a widower, sailed with four of his children to America, where he arrived in August 1682.Thomas Holme Historical Marker Holme designed the plan of the city of Philadelphia and produced the first detailed map of Pennsylvania, entitled \\"A Mapp of Ye Improved Part of Pensilvania in America, Divided Into Countyes, Townships and Lotts....\\" (published circa 1687).\\"A Brief History of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Spring City, Pa\\" Page 7, 1899 On Penn's arrival in the colony, he appointed Holme as one of his councilors. Holme also served as a justice of the peace and commissioner of property. Holme held the office of Surveyor-General until his death at age 71 in the spring of 1695, in Dublin Township, Philadelphia County (now the Holmesburg section of the city of Philadelphia). In 1863, a memorial was erected at his burial site, in the form of a six-foot-tall marble obelisk, near where his home is believed to have been located, now part of Pennypack Park.

She was an anchoress, who came from a wealthy Anglo-Saxon family trying to accommodate with the Normans at that time. She later became the prioress of a community of nuns. Early life Originally named Theodora, she was born into a wealthy merchant family.\\"Christina of Markyate\\", Diocese of Ely Her mother's name was Beatrix, marking an effort to appear more Norman, and her father's was Auti. Her mother told a story of \\"knowing\\" her daughter would be holy because a dove had flown into her sleeve and lived there for seven days while she was pregnant. As a child, Theodora is said to have talked to Christ \\"as if he were a man whom she could see.\\" She befriended an older man named Sueno, who became her first religious mentor. Her hagiography states that Sueno had once led an unholy life and that Christina's faith renewed his, so that they helped each other. Theodora visited St Alban's Abbey in Hertfordshire with her parents in her youth and the visit apparently instilled in her the deep faith that prompted her to make a private vow of chastity.Urquhart, Toni. \\"A book for Christina of Markyate\\" Florida State University Special Collections & Archives division She told Sueno of this, but no one else. Marriage While visiting an aunt, Elfgifu, Theodora met Bishop Ranulf Flambard. Her aunt was the bishop's concubine and Ranulf lusted after young Theodora, seeking to make her another one of his concubines. According to one account, when Ranulf attempted to force his attentions on her, Theodora suggested that she lock the door to guarantee their privacy. When he agreed, she proceeded to do so, from the outside, trapping him within.Speigel, Frances. \\"Christina of Markyate: A Medieval Woman Who Refused Marriage\\", Decoded Past, September 15. 2014 Rebuffed, he then exacted revenge by brokering a marriage for her with a young nobleman named Beorhtred. Theodora's parents readily agreed, but Theodora did not, in view of her vow. Her angry parents arranged for Beorhtred to have access to her room, only to discover next morning that the two had spent the night discussing religious subjects. On one occasion Theodora recounted the life of St Cecilia, who according to legend, was guarded on her wedding night by a vengeful angel. On another occasion, she hid behind a tapestry while Beorhtred searched for her in vain. As word went round of Theodora's plight, a hermit name Eadwine, with the blessing of the Archbishop of Canterbury, helped her to escape disguised in men's clothes. Eadwine then took her to stay with an anchoress at Flamstead named Alfwen, who hid her from her family. There Theodora changed her name to Christina. Anchoress Christina next found shelter with Roger, a hermit and sub-deacon of St Alban's Abbey, whose cell was at Markyate. The hermit Roger, who died before 1118 and whose death anniversary (12 September) is recorded in the St. Albans Psalter, is likely to have been identical with Roger d'Aubigny, a brother of abbot Richard d'Aubigny (1087‚Äì1119) and father of William d'Aubigny (Pincerna).Bernhard Gallistl, \\"A book for Avicia?\\" Der Eremit Roger im Psalter von St. Albans, Concilium medii aevi, 21, 2018, pp. 1‚Äì52. Christina spent her time there in prayer, sewing to support herself. She was a skilled needlewoman, who later embroidered three mitres of superb workmanship for Pope Adrian IV.\\"The Personalities\\", St Alban's Psalter, University of Aberdeen After two years, Beorhtard released Christina from her marriage contract, and Archbishop Thurstan of York formally annulled the marriage in 1122. Thereafter Christina was able to come out of hiding and move into a small hut. Prioress Upon the death of Roger, Christina took over the hermitage near St Alban's Abbey, where she reportedly experienced frequent visions of Jesus, Mary, and St Margaret. Other women, including her sister Margaret, joined her there. Christina took her vows at St Albans in 1131. Markyate Priory was established in 1145. Geoffrey de Gorham became abbot of St Albans in 1119, and as prioress, Christina became his close friend and counsellor. Their friendship was such that he is said to have altered the St. Albans Psalter as a gift for her, by having an illuminated \\"C\\" placed at the beginning of Psalm 105. Images of each page of the Psalter with transcriptions and translations of the text can be found on the online St Albans Psalter project. Hagiography Her Latin Vita was apparently written by a monk of St Alban's Abbey. This hagiography is considered to be one of the most realistic known. Some parts still follow the typical route of hagiographies ‚Äì a vow of chastity, overcoming all obstacles including marriage, and even being an anchoress ‚Äì but others pull away from the norm. Christina is shown as having power as Prioress of St Albans. She is also one of very few shown to have sexual desire, even though she overcomes it. Her hagiography is incomplete. Parts were lost in a fire in the 18th century and it is unknown whether the biographer wrote the account before or after her death. In the light of the Priory's legal foundation by St Paul's, the friendship between Christina and Geoffrey seems likely to derive from a fiction by Abbot Robert de Gorron (1151‚Äì1166)Katie Bugyis: The Author of the Life of Christina of Markyate: The Case for Robert de Gorron (died 1166), in: The Journal of Ecclesiastical History 68 (2017), pp. 719‚Äì746 or by the chronicler Matthew Paris (c. 1200‚Äì1259), who alleged in his chronicle that St Alban's Abbey had clerical competence over the nuns of Markyate. \\"It would almost seem that in the Gesta Abbatum the origins of Markyate and Sopwell have been confused. There Markyate Priory is said to have arisen through the occupation of the hermitage of Roger, a former monk of St. Albans, by a saintly recluse called Christina, for whom abbot Geoffrey built a house. But in reality Markyate was not dependent on St. Albans, as it would have been if founded by the abbot, and as Sopwell was.\\"William Page, The Victoria History of the County of Hertford , 4, London 1914, p. 422. \\"It is therefore altogether very possible that what we are dealing with here is a later piece of fiction from a monastic chronicler.\\"Bernhard Gallistl, \\"The Christina of Markyate Psalter\\" A Modern Legend: On the Purpose of the St. Albans Psalter, Concilium medii aevi, 17, 2014, p. 45, A medieval cult of the anchoress Christina is not substantiated by liturgical or historical sources.Rachel M.

The film stars Kieran O'Brien and Margo Stilley. The title refers to the nine songs played by eight different rock bands that complement the story of the film. It was controversial upon original release due to its sexual content, which included unsimulated footage of the two leads, Kieran O'Brien and Margo Stilley, having sexual intercourse and performing oral sex as well as a scene of ejaculation.What Culture#3: 9 Songs The film was showcased at the Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film tells the modern love story set over a period of 12 months in London, England, of a young couple: Matt, a British climatologist, and Lisa, an American exchange student. The story is framed in a personal review from Matt's perspective when he is working in Antarctica. Their main common interest is a passion for live music and they frequently attend rock concerts together. The film depicts the couple, or Matt alone, watching the nine songs at Brixton Academy and other concert venues. It also shows their weekend getaway into the countryside, and their travels around London. Lisa brings their short and intense relationship to an end at Christmas time when she returns to the United States.

The sex is used as a metaphor for the rest of the couple's relationship. And it is shot with Winterbottom's customary sensitivity.\\" Radio Times gave a lackluster review, awarding it two stars out of five and claiming: \\"From the hot, blurry chaos of the gigs to the sparsely furnished flat where the couple unite, this is very much an exercise in style over content. As such, some will find it a rewarding art house experiment with much to recommend it, others watching simply for the explicit and unsimulated lovemaking may well find it boring and pretentious.\\" Writing for East Bay Express, Luke Y. Thompson claimed: \\"Michael Winterbottom delivers the sex, and not much else.\\" He continued: \\"Though there isn't much narrative in effect, Winterbottom does quite literally build to a climax...O'Brien is well endowed, while Stilley is all natural...If the movie were any longer, the onscreen events might become a lot more tedious, but there are just enough different things each time to avoid dull repetition. You may have seen a handjob onscreen, for instance, but have you ever seen a foot job? It's interesting, to say the least.\\" 9 Songs currently holds a positive score of 24% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 97 reviews with an average rating of 4.38/10. The site's consensus states: \\"The unerotic sex scenes quickly become tedious to watch, and the lovers lack the personality necessary to make viewers care about them.\\" Controversy According to The Guardian, 9 Songs is the most sexually explicit mainstream film to date, largely because it includes several scenes of real sex between the two lead actors. The film is unusual in that it features its lead actors, Margo Stilley and Kieran O'Brien, having unsimulated and very graphic sex, including genital fondling, masturbation with and without a vibrator (including a footjob in a bathtub scene), penetrative vaginal sex, cunnilingus and fellatio. During a scene in which Stilley gives O'Brien a handjob after performing fellatio on him, O'Brien became the only actor who has been shown ejaculating in a mainstream, UK-produced feature. To avoid a possible pregnancy, O'Brien wore a condom on his erect penis during the vaginal sex but not while receiving oral sex. Margo Stilley asked Winterbottom to refer to her simply by her character's name in interviews about the film. The release sparked a debate over whether the scenes of unsimulated sex artistically contributed to the film's meaning or crossed the border into pornography. In the United Kingdom, the film received an 18 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification and became the most explicit mainstream film to be so rated in the country. In Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification gave the film an X rating, which would have prevented the film from being shown theatrically and restricted sale of the film to the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory. The OFLC Review Board later passed the film with an R rating, although the South Australian Classification Council raised the rating back to X in South Australia. In New Zealand, while the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards lobbied for the film to be kept out of cinemas, it was passed uncut at R18 by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. The film was broadcast on New Zealand pay TV Rialto Channel in July 2007. In June 2008, the film was broadcast on Dutch national television by the public broadcasting station VPRO.

VV., Dizionario di toponomastica. Storia e significato dei nomi geografici italiani, Milano, GARZANTI, 1996, p. 327 is a comune and city in the province of South Sardinia in Italy. It was co-capital of the province of Carbonia-Iglesias with Carbonia, and the province's second-largest community. Under Spanish control Iglesias was one of the most important royal cities on Sardinia, and it is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Iglesias. At an elevation of in the hills of southwestern Sardinia, it was the centre of a mining district from which lead, zinc, and silver were extracted. Iglesias was also a centre for the distillation of sulfuric acid. History=Prehistory and ancient history The area around present-day Iglesias was inhabited in prehistory, with the oldest traces of human settlement dating to the Neolithic. The fourth-millennium-BC domus de Janas, attributed to the Ozieri culture, were discovered in the mountainous region of San Benedetto. Other pre-Nuragic finds attributed to the Monte Claro, Bell Beaker and Bonnanaro cultures were discovered in nearby caves,La collezione Pistis-Corsi ed il patrimonio archeologico del Comune di Iglesias followed by evidence of a Nuragic, Punic and Roman presence. Ancient Roman sources record a city known as Metalla, perhaps located along Iglesias' border with Fluminimaggiore. Medieval history During the ninth century AD, after a period of human absence, a small town arose with a Byzantine church (the Church of San Salvatore). When the Byzantine influence left Sardinia, the southern part of the island was controlled by the Judicate of Cagliari. After the fall of the Judicate in 1258, south-western Sardinia (the curatorias of Cixerri and Sulcis) was assigned to the Della Gherardesca family; the Cixerri region was controlled by Ugolino della Gherardesca. The count took advantage of the region's silver resources and established a city: Latin: Villa Ecclesiae (Churchville), renovating old buildings and constructing new ones. The Della Gherardesca family built the medieval Castle of Salvaterra, defence walls, a hospital and an aqueduct. Torre pisana in Iglesias After Ugolino's March 1289 death in Pisa's Tower of Muda (where he was imprisoned in the summer of 1288 for sedition and treason, his Sardinian holdings in the Cixerri reason were inherited by his son, Guelfo della Gherardesca; escaped from Pisa in 1288, he had settled in the Villa di Chiesa. Guelfo, hostile to the Pisan government, tried to seize one-sixth of the former Judicate of Cagliari (Sulcis) owned by Gherardo della Gherardesca's heirs and occupied Villamassargia's Castle of Gioiosa Guardia. Pisa's response was swift; in 1295 republican troops, supported by the forces of Marianus II of Arborea, attacked Villa di Chiesa. Guelfo was wounded near Domusnovas; after trying to escape to Sassari, he died from an infection in the hospital of Siete Fuentes. Villa di Chiesa was briefly administered by Arborea before falling under Pisan control between 1301 and 1302. Under Pisan domination, Villa di Chiesa was one of the most important and populous cities on Sardinia thanks to its lead and silver resources. At the beginning of the 14th century, its mines produced an estimated 10 percent of Europe's circulating silver.Enrico Artifoni, Storia medievale, p.471 The city, primarily inhabited by Sardinians and Pisans, also housed other communities from Tuscany and the Italian Peninsula, Corsica and Germany. The city was governed by the Breve di Villa di Chiesa, its original legal code, a 1327 version of which is preserved in the municipal archives. A mint was established in the city. Conquered by the Aragonese on February 7, 1324 after an over seven-month siege, Villa di Chiesa was the first Sardinian city to fall to the Iberians and the first city of the new Kingdom of Sardinia to be recognised as a royal city in June 1327. During the Aragonese period, the city's name changed from Villa di Chiesa to Iglesias. 14th-century real commemorating Alfonso IV of Aragon, coined in the Iglesian mint During the transition from Pisan to Aragonese rule, 6,000‚Äì7,000 people lived in Villa di Chiesa; however, the Black Plague of 1348 killed much of the population.Roberto Farinelli, Giovanna Santinucci, I codici minerari nell‚ÄôEuropa preindustriale: archeologia e storia p.46 In late 1353 a revolt began against the Aragon government, siding with Marianus IV of Arborea (who had begun hostilities against the Crown of Aragon). After the 1355 peace of Sanluri, the city returned to Aragon; in 1365, with the resumption of a conflict between the Judicate of Arborea and the Kingdom of Sardinia, Villa di Chiesa was recaptured by Marianus IV of Arborea. The city remained in Arborean hands until 1388 when, after the treaty between Eleanor of Arborea and John I of Aragon, it was returned to the Aragonese. In 1391 the city again revolted against the Aragonese, welcoming the judge's army led by Brancaleone Doria. It was seized by the Iberians in the summer of 1409. In 1436, Alfonso V of Aragon gave the city in fief to Eleonora Carroz for 5,000 gold florins; however, after paying a ransom Villa di Chiesa regained the status of a royal city in 1450. Modern history Piazza La Marmora Corso Matteotti Men in traditional dress Women in traditional dress In 1720, after almost 400 years of Aragonese-Spanish rule, the city passed with the rest of Sardinia to the House of Savoy. Since the mid-19th century, thanks to the reopening of nearby mines, Iglesias has experienced a period of economic, social and cultural renewal. Many miners, workers and technicians from elsewhere on Sardinia and northern Italy settled in the city, whose population increased from 5,000‚Äì6,000 during the 1850s to about 20,000 in the early 20th century. After the Second World War the Sardinian mining sector was in crisis, the effects of which involved the Iglesiente's mines and the town of Iglesias.

Steam rising from the Monteponi mine, around 1948‚Äì1955 Economy Iglesias' economy has waxed and waned because it has been largely focused on mineral resources. During the 21st century, with little surviving mining activity, the town has tried to emphasise medieval tourism with a medieval parade, a tournament of archers and a living game of chess. Attractions=Castle of Salvaterra Castle of Salvaterra Church of San Francesco Church of Santa Maria di Valverde The Castle of Salvaterra was probably built as part of urbanization after 1258 under Ugolino della Gheradesca. It was designed as a bulwark from which to survey the town and its surroundings as far as the silver mines. In 1297 Sardinia and Corsica were made subject to the Crown of Aragon by Pope Boniface VIII, but were not taken possession until 1324. The castle of San Guantino changed its name to Salvaterra and its status; a 1325 stone slab calls it castris regalis, a royal castle. The square castle's northern and eastern sides, built in courses of stone alternating with brick, seem to adhere to the original medieval plan and confer solidity. It had a chapel dedicated first to San Guantino and later to Eulalia of Barcelona. The castle well has been rebuilt in its internal courtyard. Santa Chiara Cathedral Construction of the Santa Chiara Cathedral was an initiative for demographic and urban development undertaken by the Donoratico della Gherardesca family. The cathedral has a variety of architectural styles. Over the centuries it has been transformed several times by successive rulers or restoration, particularly during the 19th century). The cathedral's fa√ßade, with a pitched roof, is divided into two parts by a horizontal, moulded cornice at the level of the architrave over the doorway. It has a large nave with six side chapels, and a cross-vaulted roof supported on pillars with carved capitals. The cathedral's bell tower houses a 1337 Andrea Pisano bronze bell; the tower was plastered and its spire added in 1862. The Museum of Sacred Art is in the cathedral's crypt. Church of San Francesco The Church of San Francesco has a gabled fa√ßade with smooth stonework; the door in its centre is surmounted by a rose window and flanked by two side oculi. Its wood-ceilinged nave is divided into seven bays, flanked by seven side chapels; the chapels and the presbytery were added during the 16th century. The chapels all have simple cross vaulting (meeting in a hanging pendant), except for the Crucifix Chapel. The stone choir replaced the original wooden choir, which was demolished at the beginning of the 20th century. The church has a marble font and artworks in the chapels, including a retablo by Antioco Mainas. The monastery, with the San Francesco Cloister, was annexed to the church during the 16th century. Church of Santa Maria di Valverde The Church of Santa Maria di Valverde is outside the town walls and nearly contemporary with the cathedral, with similar style and structure. Like the cathedral, it has a typical Romanesque style with Gothic features. The church's fa√ßade underwent conservation and restoration until the twentieth century. Built of pink trachyte ashlar, it is divided into two parts by a horizontal, moulded cornice. Its nave originally had a lower, wooden roof; it ends in a large, square, cross-vaulted presbytery with four pendants. The central pendant, larger than the others, depicts the Madonna and child. Medieval fortifications City walls Pisan walls surround the city's historic centre, following its irregular outline and using its incline with the Castle of Salvaterra. Although urban expansion led to the incorporation of several stretches of wall into private homes, the remnants retain the features of medieval military fortifications: blind fa√ßades of mixed stones arranged in horizontal courses to create an uneven mass, providing resistance to attack. With 23 towers, the walls could be passed through four gateways: Porta Maestra, Porta Castello, Porta Sant Antonio and Porta Nuova. Town Hall Town Hall Town Hall is at the heart of the historic town centre relative to the medieval walls. According to plans by civil engineer Antonio Cao Pinna, it was built by the Vincenzo Sulcis company between 1871 and 1872. The fa√ßade, set on a base of volcanic-stone ashlar, is divided horizontally by stringcourse cornices. The council meeting room was decorated during the 1920s in a design by Sardinian sculptor Francesco Ciusa and painter and illustrator Remo Branca. Artist Carmelo Floris created a triptych of panel paintings which decorates the rear walls. Sanctuary of Madonna delle Grazie The Sanctuary of Madonna delle Grazie dates to the 12th and 13th centuries, and was initially dedicated to the Cagliari martyr San Saturno. The communities which have altered the building can be seen in its fa√ßade. The oldest portion is in the centre. The church nave is divided into six bays by pointed trachyte arches supporting a wooden vault with exposed beams. Openings in the thick outer walls simulate chapels. Two chapels are on the sides of the presbytery: one dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the other to Saint Francis. Mining Art Museum The museum was conceived in 1998 by a group of mining men who wanted a tangible reminder of their origins so the history of their land would not be forgotten. Housed in the basement of the Giorgio Asproni Mining Institute, it displays scale model reproductions, newspaper articles about life in the mines and a collection of photographs. The museum also contains various machinery for excavation, drilling and transport and a reconstruction of a mechanical workshop with modern machinery. The tunnels underneath the building are reached by a ramp along a railway, along which elements of work in the mines have been reconstructed. Archive Villa di Chiesa code book The archive preserves the history of Villa di Chiesa from the Catalan-Aragonese, Spanish and Savoy periods. The documents begin with Il Breve di Villa di Chiesa, a book of laws dating back to 1327. Written on parchment (possibly mutton), only a few pages are missing. Its text, in Gothic script, was written in the Pisan dialect. The book was the result of a process of legislative drafting which began during Donoratico rule and ended with Aragon dominion. The definitive version, in four books, dates back to the period of direct rule by Pisa. Porto Flavia The harbour has an important position in innovation and technology in Sardinian mining construction. The Belgian Vieille Montagne company appointed engineer Cesare Vecelli to conduct a planning study from 1922 to 1924 of reducing the cost of transporting ore from the mine to the port. A tunnel runs through the mountain for before opening high above the sea. The opening consists of a fa√ßade with a large arch beneath the inscription \\"Porto Flavia\\", flanked by a tower. The work consisted of excavating nine reservoirs in the mountain for the ore by enlarging natural caverns. The nine large rooms open into two tunnels, one on top of the other, opposite the islet known as Pan di Zucchero (Sugarloaf). Monteponi mine Monteponi When mining activity in the region began is uncertain, but \\"Monte Paone\\" was mentioned in the 1324 will of Berto da San Miniato (a trader from Pisa). Unprofitable mining operations alternated between the government and private companies until 1850, when investors led by the Ligurian Paolo Antonio Nicolay founded the Monteponi company as a 30-year mining project using existing structures. The four-level settlement is a workers' village. A 2008 project by architects Herzog & de Meuron planned to restore the industrial area for tourism and culture. Saint Michele Church Dating to the Aragonese period, the church is linked to the Archfraternity of the Holy Virgin of Santo Monte. The only feature distinguishing the fa√ßade from a secular building is its oculus and moulded, arched lintel. The interior is a small hall and nave, divided into two bays by a pointed arch. At the centre of the presbytery, a stone table is decorated with a relief of the Last Supper; behind it is a niche with a statue of Saint Michael. A 1727 chapel dedicated to the Mysteries, contains processional statues to commemorate the Passion of Jesus. A stone font, with four fish carved into the bowl, dates to the 16th or 17th century. Saint Giuseppe Church This church was built near the church of Santa Lucia, with a hospital annex run by brothers. As Santa Lucia fell into disuse, the Sanctuary of San Giuseppe became the new location of the Confraternity of Santa Lucia (which later changed its name). Its simple facade is surmounted by a tympanum; an oculus in the centre has coloured glass forming an image of Saint Joseph and the child Jesus. The nave has a vault of pointed arches and the presbytery, with a square apse, has cross-vaulting. Two chapels are furnished with simulacra, including a wooden niche. Purissima Church As the only example in Iglesias of Counter-Reformation architecture, the predominant feature of this church is the correspondence between its interior and exterior. The facade has white plaster contrasting with red trachyte. Its bell tower, which functions as a clock tower, was rebuilt during the 20th century. The interior has a large nave with three side chapels and marble ornamentation. Decorative features added after 1774, when the Jesuits left the city after the suppression of their order, contrast with the church's general sobriety; its paintings date to the early 20th century, in fact. An exhibition on sacred architecture in Sulcis-Iglesiente is in the church's underground rooms. Saint Domenico Church The church is distinctive for its sober, decorative fa√ßade, reminiscent of embroidery. Framed by Corinthian columns and an architrave engraved with the Cannavera coat of arms, the doorway is in Gothic-Catalan style. The nave has a barrel vault, divided into four spans by pointed arches. Two chapels are on each side, dedicated to the corporations which financed the work. The chapels added in 1910 differ from the original building in displaying its exposed rock. Four memorial tablets include one dedicated to Bishop Nicol√≤ Cannavera, who built the church. Saint Marcello Church Saint Marcello Church was the headquarters of the San Marcello brotherhood and was adjacent to the Church of San Francesco until the end of the 19th century, when it was moved to make room for a primary school. The reconstruction project was planned by engineer Luigi Degrossi in 1901 with material recovered from the original church, including slate slabs for the inside flooring. The red, sloping neo-Gothic fa√ßade, its doorway containing a pointed arch, is all that remains of the original building. At the cusp of the arch, a Greek orthodox cross points to the rose window above; the top of the fa√ßade has a motif of small Gothic arches, identical to those on the windows of the bishop's palace. Saint Antonio Abbot Saint Antonio Abbot dates back prior to the construction of the town (after 1258). On a hill near the Cixerri Valley, the church would have been at the centre of a small village. The building, which has undergone much reconstruction, has a simple facade with a gabled roof in the Byzantine style. Its facade indicates the church's age, traces of which remain in the present sacristy; neighbouring buildings have absorbed one of the original building's three naves. Inside is a fairly-small, quadrangular room with four pointed arches marking four bays and terminating in a large, horseshoe-shaped apse. Saint Salvatore Church Saint Salvatore Church, also dating to before the city's construction, is outside the city walls. A comparison with the Church of Santa Croce in Ittireddu dates it to the ninth or tenth century. The church follows the structural layout of other churches of average size, with a cruciform plan built near developing settlements. The simple building has a sloping facade, dominated by an arched doorway from which its weight is distributed to the external walls. The nave crosses the transept and ends in a window, tracing the ancient apse. Saint Francesco Cloister The church and monastery of San Francesco belonged to the Friars Conventual Minor in Sardinia. The cloister was an open space, surrounded on four sides by porticos. The monastery includes wings developed according to the model of open ground-floor loggias, arranged around a green area accessed through broad arches of pink trachyte. It was heavily damaged during World War II (when it was used as an air-raid shelter), but part of the original complex has been restored. Cemetery The cemetery covers the area between Via Cappuccini and Su Pardu, following a plan with intersecting avenues marking squares. At the centre, a stairway leads to the chapel on the principal avenue. Developed during successive enlargements, the cemetery does not follow a plan; certain aspects stand out, such as the Avenue of the Children. Its nucleus is eclectic in its outer railings, funeral stones, urns, owls and angels flanking the stairway. The entrance from Via Cappuccini separates the sober Liberty-style flowers and Masonic symbols on one side from memorials to the war dead on the other. It includes sculptures by Giuseppe Sartorio. Piazza Sella Piazza Sella, with benches, a pedestrian area and the town market, is Iglesias's social centre. It is bordered by Via Garibaldi (which leads to the railway station and separates it from nearby Piazza Oberdan), Via Valverde and Via Gramsci. The piazza is named after Quintino Sella because of the statue of the politician and economist by Giuseppe Sartorio which was erected in its centre in 1885; Sella developed Iglesias as a mining town. Piazza Oberdan Opposite Piazza Sella is a piazza named after Guglielmo Oberdan, with a war memorial in its centre created in 1928 by Francesco Ciusa. The area bordering the piazza was a car park during the 1930s and 1940s and was also the Satas bus station. The piazza has been used for military commemorations, from Fascist gatherings and parades to present-day celebrations of national events. A renovation of Piazza Oberdan was proposed in April 1953; pavement slabs were laid and flower beds were arranged around the monument, which was fenced off with chains. In 1981, the piazza was resurfaced and its flower beds rearranged. Saint Barbara Cave Discovered in 1952, some scholars estimate that the cave dates back to the Silurian (between 444 and 416 million years ago). A tour takes about three hours; it begins on a small train which runs to a lift, which approaches a grotto. A spiral staircase leads into the interior. A large, elliptical room with a diameter of at its widest point and a height of , the cave has aragonite columns, calcareous formations in a variety of shapes and a pool in diameter. The cave is covered in concretions, and \\"organ pipes\\" are calcareous formations which reproduce the sound of an organ when touched. Cala Domestica Tower The tower was built for defence and counterattack on the furthest promontory of the coast between Portixeddu and Porto Paglia, above the harbour entrance, against Muslim invasion as part of a network of hundreds of towers and outposts built by the Spanish crown. The towers, equipped with cannons, would open fire while the watchtowers sent smoke signals or drumbeat warnings. A fortress in the shape of a truncated cone, high and in diameter, was constructed of calcareous stone ashlar. The doorway, about high, leads into a domed room about wide with six loopholes. Mineralogical Museum The museum was built in 1871, at the same time as the mining school, to complete the miners‚Äô theoretical training. It has two rooms with about 3,000 items, one of the sector's most complete and valuable collections. The first room has samples from all over the world, including samples from the Paris basin. In addition to the mineral samples, there are examples of the tools used to extract them. The second room contains the nucleus of the collection, with underground minerals (now no longer obtainable) from throughout the region. The Liberty style display cases have grotesque and arabesque carvings and herms.

Messenger protocol. It enabled users to chat with each other over the global Yahoo! chat system. The last version, ChitChat 1.2, had a more refined user interface, speed improvements, Address Book support, IM reformatting, an improved events system, and numerous bug fixes. ChitChat was programmed in the REALBasic programming environment.  History  ChitChat was an offshoot of \\"miChat!\\", a Yahoo! Chat program for Macintosh computers written by J. Seth Lowe in the REALbasic programming language. In late 2000, Seth publicly asked for other REALbasic programmers to join the project, in the hope that it would spawn a number of competing Yahoo! Chat clients and enrich the Macintosh experience. A programmer by the name of Tomis Erwin responded to this query. After collaborating on several features, Seth encouraged him to take free rein in creating his own client from the miChat code base. The new program, dubbed \\"ChitChat\\", went through several major interface overhauls throughout its existence, seemingly in perpetual beta or pre-release, though it was available publicly. Finally, \\"ChitChat 1.0\\" was released in early 2004 with versions for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and Windows 98. Over the years ChitChat had picked up a rather large feature set. In an effort to deflect feature creep without crippling the program, \\"ChitChat Lite\\" was introduced in late 2005. The Lite version, a simplified no-frills release, never picked up as large a user base as its predecessor.  End of the Line  In April 2006, Yahoo! disconnected their \\"Java Chat\\" (known internally as YCHT protocol) in favor of the newer Yahoo! Messenger protocol (known as YMSG). ChitChat was designed on this older protocol and would need to be rewritten to support the new system. Citing the amount of time and effort a re-write would entail, Tomis announced that ChitChat was effectively terminated. \\"...I would like to thank everyone for all the support over the years. It was fun, and I learned a lot...\\" ~ Tomis Erwin, ChitChat Homepage During the years that ChitChat was in active development, a new trend in chat clients emerged; that of the multi-client.

Designed by architects John Replogle, Robert Dorr Jr., Milton Schwartz and Maxwell Starkman, it was the tenth resort to open on the Strip. Bellagio now stands on the former grounds. The Dunes golf course is now occupied by parts of Park MGM, New York-New York, CityCenter, Cosmopolitan, and T-Mobile Arena (home of the Vegas Golden Knights). History In the early 1950s, Al Gottesman, the retired owner of a movie theater chain who was living in Miami, received a request from two developers for a $58,000 loan that would be used to purchase desert property for a Las Vegas hotel. Gottesman agreed to provide funding in exchange for a small portion of the hotel's profits. Gottesman provided an additional $16,000 to hire an architect for the new project. Gottesman later discovered that other partners, who were from Rhode Island and were led by Joe Sullivan, had also invested in the project. Sullivan's group had secretly included mobster Raymond Patriarca, a fact that was not discovered until years later. The initial developers later dropped out of the project, and the property was subsequently taken over by Gottesman and by Sullivan's group, both of whom had plans for a large gambling resort. An additional $1.5 million was raised, with Beverly Hills jewelry seller Bob Rice as an additional partner. A pension fund from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which had connections to the mafia, helped to complete the new resort, which cost $3.5 million to build. Opening and early years (1955‚Äì1960s) Violetta Villas The Dunes, themed after the Arabian Nights stories, opened on May 23, 1955. It was designed by architects John Replogle and Robert Dorr Jr. Milton Schultz designed the Diamond of the Dunes tower in 1961. Maxwell Starkman designed the south tower in 1979.Dunes hotel tower architect Starkman dies, Las Vegas Sun, January 26, 2004 The new resort included 200 hotel rooms, located in several two-story buildings. Also featured was a 90-foot V-shaped swimming pool and a 150-foot lagoon. The resort also featured the Arabian Room, which had the capabilities and size of a Broadway theatre. Hollywood star Vera-Ellen headlined on opening night. The resort was located on an property, some of which remained vacant at the time of opening. The hotel's slogan was \\"The Miracle in the Desert\\". From the time of its opening, the Dunes was known for the tall fiberglass sultan statue that stood above its main entrance. Gottesman and Sullivan were surprised by the amount of money lost on the hotel and on expensive headliner entertainment, while the resort suffered from poor revenue on its table games and only minimal success from the Arabian Room. Managers of the Sands Hotel and Casino leased the showroom and casino for a short time, but were unable to make it a success. By August 1955, Gottesman was prepared to sell the resort as he had become upset with the large amount of his own money that he had to spend to keep it operational. The casino was closed briefly for a lack of business. The resort was purchased in 1956 by two businessmen, Major A. Riddle and Jake Gottlieb, who had dealings with the Chicago Outfit. Rice stayed with the property to work on its entertainment aspect with Riddle. On January 10, 1957, Riddle introduced Nevada's first topless show, called Minsky's Follies, the first of which was \\"Minsky Goes to Paris.\\" Although the State Legislature was opposed to the show, it set a record for attendance in a single week at 16,000. In 1958, the pension fund of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters loaned $4 million to Riddle and Gottlieb to help the resort. At one point, Jayne Mansfield performed in the resort's showroom for $35,000 a week. An 18-hole golf course was added in 1959. In April 1959, the Dunes celebrated what was the first double groundbreaking ceremony in Las Vegas, with construction beginning simultaneously on the resort's new Exhibitor & Convention Hall and a 500-space parking lot. In 1961, a 24-story, 250-room hotel tower, known as Diamond of the Dunes, was added to the northern part of the property, bringing the total number of rooms to 450. At the top of the tower was the Top O' the Strip restaurant and lounge. The tower was designed by Chicago architect Milton Schwartz. The tower was the tallest building in the state at the time. The height was 84m / 275'7\\". It was completed in 1964. In 1964 Schwartz designed a restaurant with a dome-shaped roof, known as Dome of the Sea, operated on the property through the 1970s. Many top performers, such as Dean Martin, Liberace, George Burns, Ray Vasquez, Pat Cooper, Judy Garland, Violetta Villas, Phyllis Diller and Frank Sinatra, performed at the hotel. Operation and final years (1960s‚Äì1993) The Dunes, and Oasis Casino, in 1983 Although it opened to much fanfare, it struggled from the start because The Dunes was at the then-southernmost part of the Strip. The hotel frequently had to borrow money, and even the Sands Hotel lent its executives to help out, as well as bringing in numerous famous celebrities and entertainers such as Frank Sinatra's surprise appearance dressed as a sultan. In the late 1960s, Morris Shenker bought an interest in the Dunes and became its Chairman of the Board. In 1970, there were unrealized rumors Howard Hughes would buy into the hotel. From 1976 to 1978, Johnny Elvis Foster starred in his Elvis show, For The Love Of Elvis, at the Dunes' showroom. Shenker was Foster's godfather. Foster was the first Elvis impersonator before Elvis died. In 1979, the South Tower was added, expanding the hotel to 1300 rooms. The new tower was designed by Los Angeles architect Maxwell Starkman. In 1983, brothers Stuart and Clifford Perlman, founders of Caesars World, agreed to buy the Dunes for $185 million, and even took over operation of the property for several months, but the sale ultimately fell through. A second casino in a separate, round building on the site opened in 1983 under the name Oasis Casino at The Dunes. In 1985, the sultan statue was moved to the golf course during renovations, and later caught fire, reportedly due to an electrical short. Many major professional boxing events took place at the Dunes during this era, from 1975 to 1990; notably the May 20, 1983 undercard that featured Ossie Ocasio retaining his WBA's world Cruiserweight title by fifteen round unanimous decision over Randy Stephens, Greg Page beat Renaldo Snipes by twelve rounds unanimous decision in a WBC's Heavyweight division elimination bout, Michael Dokes retained his WBA world Heavyweight title with a fifteen round draw (tie) over Mike Weaver in their rematch, and Larry Holmes won over Tim Witherspoon by a twelve round split decision to retain his WBC world Heavyweight title. This was the first time in history that two world Heavyweight championship fights took place on the same day. The Dunes, suffering from low revenue, filed for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 on November 6, 1985. Later that year, Steve Wynn, chairman of the local Golden Nugget hotel-casino, offered $115 million to purchase the resort, although the offer was rejected. Businessman Donald Trump subsequently offered to purchase the resort for $100 million, although he was rejected as well. By July 1987, Hilton Hotels Corporation and Japanese investor Masao Nangaku both separately planned to purchase the resort. Nangaku purchased the Dunes that year for $155 million, although he could not make it financially successful. Neon facade of the Oasis Casino in 1990 On November 17, 1992, the Dunes was sold to Wynn's company, Mirage Resorts, Inc., for $75 million. Closing and demolition On January 26, 1993, the Dunes closed its doors for good. A liquidation sale was conducted by National Content Liquidators to clear the property of its contents as a prelude to the building's demolition. Like many of the legendary properties of its era, it could no longer compete with the newer and more exciting megaresorts that were being built. Steve Wynn bought the Dunes and started the redevelopment trend with the demolition of the 32-year-old North Tower. On October 27, 1993, the Dunes was demolished in a grand ceremony that involved major fireworks displays and the use of several \\"cannon blasts\\" from the English ship 'HMS Britannia' of Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. Over 200,000 people watched its demise. The Dunes sign itself was lit and read \\"No Vacancy\\" as if it were still open. Steve Wynn, along with Controlled Demolition, Inc. stood by and said \\"Captain of the Britannia, are you ready sir? Prepare broadside. Ready! Aim! Fire!\\" Cannon shots from the ship were simulated to coincide with explosions along the Dunes property. The neon sign was destroyed and a fireball fueled by 16,000 liters (4226 gallons) of aviation fuel engulfed the Diamond Tower shortly before explosives brought it down. Everything except the south tower was destroyed \\"amid a shower of fireworks never before equaled west of the Mississippi.\\" The 15-year-old South Tower was demolished 9 months later in July 20th 1994, with no fanfare and minimal media attention. The demolition also held symbolic significance for the city. Many long-time residents knew the Dunes was controlled by the mafia, having been first built with money from it and the mob-controlled pension funds of the Teamsters and Pipefitters unions. The demolition signaled the end of significant mafia control and influence in Las Vegas. For many years, the hotel was owned by Major Riddle from the \\"Chicago Outfit\\" and later sold in part to Morris Shenker, an \\"attorney associated with the St. Louis Mafia, Meyer Lansky, Jimmy Hoffa, and Frank Foster, owner of Athony Alarm\\". Riddle and Shenker later became a target of the Organized Crime Strike Force in St. Louis. During its construction of a new resort and casino, workers found four bags of Dunes casino chips that were buried at the site. The Bellagio now stands in place of the Dunes: the former‚Äôs fountain and lake alone are located on the site of the latter‚Äôs casino and its North tower. The Dunes golf course is now occupied by parts of Park MGM, New York-New York, CityCenter, and Cosmopolitan, and T-Mobile Arena.

Born in Trenton, New York, Page was the son of Ebenezer and Rachael Page. He was baptized into the Church of Christ, established by Joseph Smith, in Brownhelm, Ohio, in August 1833 by missionary Emer Harris (brother of Martin Harris, a witness to the golden plates). After his conversion, Page was ordained an elder. He relocated to Kirtland, Ohio, in 1835, and joined the growing body of church members in that region. Page served two missions in Upper Canada, the first beginning in May 1836 and the second in February 1837. By his count, he baptized 600 persons. Page was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in July 1838. In August 1838, he moved his family to Missouri, settling in Far West, Caldwell County. Life was difficult for the new Missouri settlers. Page left personal accounts of attacks by mobs of Missouri residents, both while with the wagon train and while residing in Far West. He noted that he \\"buried one wife and two children as martyrs to our holy religion, since they died through extreme suffering for the want of the common comforts of life.\\"B. H. Roberts (ed.), History of the Church 3:241. Page received his ordination to the office of apostle in Far West on December 19, 1838, from Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball. Page and fellow apostle Orson Hyde were called to travel and preach in the Holy Land and dedicate the land for the return of the Jews. He and Hyde started on their mission, but Page had a change of heart and never left the United States. In June 1841, in Philadelphia, apostle George A. Smith sought him out and encouraged him to complete his preparations and sail with Hyde in two days time. Page refused to go. While in Philadelphia, Page became involved in a controversy with some of the Latter Day Saints there, which led to a directive from Assistant President of the Church Hyrum Smith instructing Page to return to church headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois. After the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, Page made a brief claim to the leadership of the church. The majority of the Latter Day Saints, under the direction of Brigham Young, rejected Page's claim, but retained him in his position with the Quorum of the Twelve. Page was then called to serve in the Council of Fifty to help plan and facilitate the church's move to the Rocky Mountains. After urging the Latter Day Saints to follow James J. Strang as leader of the church, Page was excommunicated on June 27, 1846. Ezra T. Benson was called by Young to replace Page in the Quorum. Although Page was an apostle under Joseph Smith and President of the Quorum of the Twelve under Strang, he eventually came to reject both leaders as \\"fallen prophets\\". He later became affiliated with the organization of James C. Brewster and Hazen Aldrich, and later that of Granville Hedrick. He was instrumental in helping the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) (Hedrickites) obtain possession of the Temple Lot in Independence, Missouri. Page died in 1867 in DeKalb County, Illinois.

The Third International Theory, also known as the Third Universal Theory (), was the style of government proposed by Muammar Gaddafi in the early 1970s, on which his government, the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, was officially based. It was partly inspired by Islamic socialism, Arab nationalism, African nationalism and partly by the principles of direct democracy. It has similarities with the system of Yugoslav municipal self- management in Titoist Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav Third Way during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s as developed by Edvard Kardelj. It was proposed by Gaddafi as an alternative to capitalism and communism for Third World countries, based on the stated belief that both of these ideologies had been proven invalid. The Higher Council for National Guidance was created to disseminate and implement this theory, and it found partial realization in Libya. By 2011 the fall and death of Gaddafi had seen his system disestablished and replaced by the National Transitional Council.  Background  Muammar Gaddafi, author of the Third International Theory, here in 2009. Key provisions of the Third International Theory are outlined in The Green Book (published from 1976‚Äì1979). It is a system of views which criticizes European-style democracy and Soviet Marxism in detail. Intellectual and political context In the 1960s and 70s, in the countries of the Arab-Muslim East, various theories of \\"national brands of socialism\\", named \\"Islamic socialism\\", became widespread. This socialism was based on the principles of nationalism, religion and equality, and its ideas inspired a number of revolutions, popular uprisings and coups in the Arab world. Similarly, in Libya, on 1 September 1969 a group of Libyan army officers belonging to the Movement of Free Officers, Unionists, and Socialists overthrew the monarchy and proclaimed the Libyan Arab Republic. The supreme power was temporarily relegated to the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), headed by 27-year-old Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.Borisov SP Muammar Gaddafi on the road to socialism / / Pravda. - 27 March 2002. - ‚Ññ 23, pp. 19 The anti-imperialist orientation of the Libyan revolution manifested itself clearly in the first months of the new regime. On 7 October 1969 at the 24th Session of UN General Assembly, the Permanent Representative of Libya announced its intention to eliminate all foreign bases on Libyan land. Following this, the Libyan leadership informed the ambassadors of the United States and Britain that it was terminating the respective agreements. Almost at the same time an offensive began against the position of foreign capital in the economy. The first results and the nearest tasks of the Libyan revolution were fixed in a public statement on 11 December 1969, a Provisional Constitutional Declaration. Islam was declared the official state religion. It was proclaimed that one of the main goals of the revolution was the building of a form of socialism based on \\"religion, morality and patriotism\\". Gaddafi and his companions intended to achieve this through \\"social justice, high levels of production, the elimination of all forms of exploitation and the equitable distribution of national wealth\\". The Revolutionary Command Council was to function as the centre of the political organization of society, with the right to appoint cabinet ministers, to declare war and enter into contracts, to issue decrees with the force of law, and to handle key aspects of internal affairs and foreign policy. Chairman of the IBS, Gaddafi was appointed head of the Libyan Arab Republic. In 1973, Gaddafi organized the Arab Socialist Union, which became the sole legal political organization in the country. In 1977 the General People's Congress, representing numerous national committees, adopted a decree (the \\"Sabha Declaration\\") on the establishment of a \\"regime of people's power\\" (the so-called 'direct popular democracy') in Libya, and the country was renamed the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The Revolutionary Command Council was also renamed and transformed into the General Secretariat of the Congress. In practice, the Arab Socialist Union then merged with the apparatus of the General People's Congress. The people elected into the General Secretariat of the General People's Congress were Gaddafi (General Secretary) and four of his closest associates ‚Äî Major Abdessalam Jalloud, and generals Abu-Bakr Younis Jabr, Mustafa al-Harrubi and Huveyldi al-Hmeydi. Two years later, the five leaders resigned from public office, yielding them to professional managers. From then until his death, Gaddafi officially held the title of the Leader of the Libyan Revolution and the group of the five leaders is named \\"the Revolutionary Leadership\\". Furthermore, a hierarchy of Revolutionary Committees was established with the purpose of implementing the policies of the Revolutionary Leadership within the system of the People's Congresses.  Doctrine  The official ideological doctrine is the Third International Theory, described in Gaddafi's \\"Green Book\\" (1976‚Äì1979). Copies of the \\"Green Book\\" were always on sale in Libyan bookstores in many languages prior to the revolution.Kudelev V. V. \\"The situation in Libya\\", Journal of the Russia in Global Affairs. - 2007. - ‚Ññ 1, pp. 31 The book is a collection of quotes of the Libyan leader, divided into three parts and covering the following vital aspects of existence: # Solving the problem of Democracy (People Power); # Solving the problem of the economy (Socialism); # The public aspect of the \\"Third International Theory.\\"  \\"People Power\\"  The first part of the \\"Green Book\\" is \\"Solving the problem of democracy: The Authority of the People\\". This political aspect of the Third International Theory, published in January 1976, rejects traditional forms of democracy such as parliament, political parties, referendums, and outlines the basic principles of direct popular democracy based on the people's congresses and people's committees. The book argues that representative democracy is in fact nothing but a kind of dictatorship. According to the \\"Green Book\\", the winner in the struggle for power is always an instrument of government - an individual, party, class; and the loser is always the people, and thus, it is not true democracy. The political struggle often leads to the rise to power of an instrument of government which represents a minority, and that through legal democratic means. Thus, all existing political regimes falsify genuine democracy and are dictatorships.Muammar Gaddafi. The Green Book: Translated from Arabic by Kovalev N.G. - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p. 4 Parliamentarism, according to Gaddafi, is a perverse solution to the problem of democracy. A Parliament can not speak on behalf of the people, because democracy means the rule of the people, not of those who act on its behalf. Methods of electing the parliament can not be considered democratic, because the masses become completely disconnected from the Members of Parliament. The MPs monopolize the power of the masses and the right to decide their business for them. Parliament, in fact, represents not the people, but the party that won the elections. In fact, the people are used by the political forces in the struggle for power. The system of elected parliaments is a demagogic system because votes can be bought and manipulated, that is, parliamentary representation is a fraud. In general, the theory of representative government is, Gaddafi argues, an outdated practice that was invented by philosophers and thinkers at the time when the common folk were ordered about like livestock by their rulers. The party, according to the \\"Green Book\\", is a modern tool of dictatorial rule - it is the power of a part over the whole. Parties are established by groups of people to act in their interests, or to impose their views on the public and to establish their ideology on it. The number of parties in a system does not alter the substance of the matter. Moreover, the more numerous the parties are, the more intensive is the power struggle between them, which in turn undermines the programmes geared to benefit the entire society. The interests of society and of its development are sacrificed for the sake of the partisan struggle for power. In addition, parties may be corrupt and can be bribed from the outside and inside. The 'opposition' is not an organ of control over the activities of the people of the ruling party, it only waits for the right moment to take the place of the ruling party at the trough of power. Control is in the hands of the party in power (through Parliament), and power in the hands of the party in control. Gaddafi compares party and clan. In his view, in the struggle for power, the party is no different from a power struggle between tribes and clans. Both types of struggle are portrayed as having a negative and disintegrating effect on society. Referendum is also described as a falsification of democracy. Voters can say only \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" The theory states that everyone should be able to justify their desire and the cause of their approval or disapproval. Therefore, to be completely democratic, it is necessary to create such an instrument of government, which would be identical to the entire nation as a whole, rather than to a representative body acting on its behalf. = People's congresses = Gaddafi offers to create a special hierarchical structure of people's congresses and committees, resulting in a system where \\"management becomes popular, control becomes popular, and the old definition of democracy as 'control of people over the government' is replaced by its new definition as 'the people's control over itself'.\\" \\"The only means of people's democracy are the people's congresses. Any other system of government is undemocratic. All existing world systems of government are undemocratic, if they do not adhere to this method of governance. People's congresses are the ultimate goal of the movement of peoples on the path to democracy. People's congresses and people's committees represent the end result of the peoples' struggle for democracy. \\" In the proposed Jamahiriya, the entire population is divided into People's Congresses, which elect the People's Committees, which in turn form the second round of the People's Congresses, which elect the State Committees, which fulfil the function of state administration. Issues considered at the People's Congresses are finally formulated each year at the General People's Congress. Accordingly, the outcomes and decisions of the General Congress are brought to the lower levels in the reverse order. At the General People's Congress, which gathers together the governing bodies of the people's congresses, the people's committees, the trade unions and the professional associations, the most important public issues are discussed and the definitive legislative decisions are made. In the first part of the \\"Green Book\\" Gaddafi also lays out his views on freedom of speech. According to him, \\"a human being, as an individual, should have the freedom of expression, and even if mad, s/he should have the right to freely express his/her madness.\\" Man, as a legal entity, is also free to express themselves as such. In the first case the man represents only himself, in the second‚Äîonly a group of individuals forming a legal entity.Muammar Gaddafi. The Green Book: Translated from Arabic by Kovalev NG - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p. 10 \\"Society is composed of many individuals and entities. Therefore, if an individual is insane, that does not mean that the rest of society are mad, too. Press is a method of expression of society, not a single person or entity. A newspaper, if owned by an individual, expresses only the views of its owner. The assertion that it represents public opinion is untenable and has no basis, because in reality it expresses the views of an individual, and from the point of view of genuine democracy it is unacceptable that an individual should own the print media and other types of media that provide the public with information. \\"  Socialism  The second part of the \\"Green Book\\"‚Äî\\"The solution of the economic problem (Socialism)\\"‚Äîsets out the economic aspect of the Third International Theory (published on 2 February 1978). This part criticizes wage labor, comparing it with slavery, and proclaims the right of an employee to any product produced by them. A person must work in accordance with their powers and must also be able to satisfy their needs, and all surplus should be directed to the accumulation of social wealth. The accumulation of surplus by one person reduces [the possibility of satisfaction of] the needs of another person, and is therefore unacceptable.Muammar Gaddafi. The Green Book: Per. Arabic for Kovalev NG - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p.22 In September 1977, Gaddafi put forward as the basis of economic life the principle of \\"self-government in the economy\\". In line with this principle, it was envisaged that enterprises should be transferred to the collective management of those who work there. The slogan \\"Partners, not employees\\" was given theoretical justification in the second part of the Green Book, and in November of the same year this idea began to be implemented in some industrial enterprises. During the development of his economic ideas, Gaddafi put forward another slogan: \\"Real Estate‚Äîproperty of its inhabitant.\\" That is, a person living in a house was an owner, not a tenant. In May 1978, a law was passed, whereby renting residential premises was prohibited, and tenants became owners of their rental apartments and houses. With the slogan \\"Partners, not employees\\", workers and employees under the leadership of the People's Committees took over businesses and institutions in not only production but also trade, as well as the various services of service. Former owners got compensation and the opportunity to participate in the management of these enterprises, but in \\"equal partnership with the producers.\\" This campaign was described as a \\"people's capture\\" and was a form of elimination of private ownership of business by upper and middle classes. The functioning of the political system of the \\"Jamahiriya\\" in the field and especially in production was hampered both by the opposition of the upper classes and by the insufficient preparations for the activities conducted and the inability of the new management staff to manage the economy. This led to discontent and unrest among the population against the political and economic innovations of the Libyan leadership. Some of the Muslim clergy accused Gaddafi of \\"deviation from the Qur'an.\\" In response, authorities made serious efforts at limiting the influence of the clergy. Gaddafi made a televised public examination of members of the pro-opposition clergy on the subject the Qur'an. According to Gaddafi, he proved that they were unable to answer his questions, and he subsequently used that as a reason to deprive some of them of the right to conduct religious services.Strokan SN Libya defends its principles / / Kommersant. - 2005. - ‚Ññ 243 / P (‚Ññ 3327), pp. 17 The final result of the economic reforms in the Jamahiriya was meant to be \\"the achievement of a new socialist society\\", a stage at which profit and money disappear from society and it becomes fully productive, and production fully meets the material needs of all members of society. At this stage, profits and money were meant to disappear by themselves. Thanks to successful oil exploration starting in 1961, Libya has become a prosperous state with the highest per capita income in Africa. In 1970, oil prices on world markets increased considerably, leading to the accumulation of substantial funds in Libya, as a supplier of oil to western countries. Government revenues from oil exports were to be used to finance urban development and the creation of a modern system of social welfare. At the same time, to improve Libya's international prestige, huge sums were spent on creating a well-equipped modern army. In the Middle East and North Africa, Libya served as a carrier of ideas of Arab nationalism and as an uncompromising enemy of Israel and the United States. The sharp drop in oil prices in mid-1980s and the UN sanctions for harbouring Palestinian separatists (in 1992) led to a significant weakening of Libya. On 12 September 2003 UN Security Council lifted the sanctions imposed in 1992.  Public aspect of the theory  The third part‚Äîthe \\"Public aspect of the Third International Theory\\" was published on 1 June 1979. This addressed many aspects of life, including women, the education system, sports, and merging the world's languages. In this part a global vision of proper co-existence is presented. The fundamental principles come down to this: every nation should have its own religion, and should recognize the importance of a continuous social chain (\\"the family‚Äîthe tribe‚Äîthe nation‚Äîthe world,\\" \\"from the small to the great\\"). According to the \\"Green Book\\": \\"if the national spirit is stronger than the religious spirit, the struggle between different nations, which used to be united in one religion, is amplified, and each of those nations achieves independence, returning to the social structure that is characteristic of it.\\" \\"A tribe is the same as a family, but one that has increased due to the increased growth of offspring, that is, the tribe is a big family. The Nation is a tribe, but a tribe that has grown as a result of increased offspring, i.e., a nation is a large tribe. The World is a nation but a nation divided into many nations as a result of population growth, i.e., the world is a great nation.\\"Muammar Gaddafi. The Green Book: Translation from Arabic by Kovalev N.G. - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p.38 \\"The tribe is the natural social protection of the individual, ensuring his social needs.\\" In Libya, according to accepted social tradition, the tribe collectively provides redemption of its members by collectively paying ransom for them, paying their fines, avenging them and collectively defending them. A special place in the Green Book is reserved for women, their physical build and social role in society: * First ‚Äì \\"A woman is a human, just like a man is\\"; * Second ‚Äì a woman is an individual of the female sex, whereas a man is an individual of the male sex. In view of this, a woman \\"has a regular disease in the form of monthly bleeding, but if this does not happen, then she has become pregnant.\\" * Third ‚Äì the tendency to deny a woman her natural role of mother and replace her with nurseries is the beginning of a denial of humane, human society and of its transformation into a biological society, living an artificial life (as a result of this, in Libya, there are no kindergartens, and a woman, once she has given birth to a child, never goes to work again). * Fourth ‚Äì males in the world of plants and animals are by nature strong and rough, whereas women in the world of plants and animals in the world and the world's peoples are by nature beautiful and tender. Accordingly, Gaddafi concluded that \\"human rights are for everyone‚Äîmen and women, but the responsibilities are not equal.\\" The issue of language is also addressed: \\"People will remain underdeveloped, until there is a common language.\\" However, this question can be resolved only through a merging of languages in a series of stages, over several generations, provided that over time these generations lose their inherited traits: \\"the sensory perceptions, tastes and temperament of their fathers and grandfathers.\\" The Green Book also has an original take on sports and spectacles: * \\"Sport can only be individual, like a prayer\\"; * \\"Mass sport is a social need of the human beings, so it is unacceptable from either a sporting or a democratic point of view to 'subcontract' sport to others [professionals]\\"; * \\"Collective sport is the business of the masses\\"; * \\"Stadiums exist in order to restrict the masses from using sports fields\\"; * \\"Boxing and various kinds of wrestling suggest that humanity has not completely rid itself of the vestiges of barbarism.\\" This approach to sport led to most of Libya's stadiums being open only during military parades, and any kind of wrestling being strictly prohibited. = Relationship with Islam = In the absence of specific prescriptions for the transformation of society in the so-called \\"Islamic socialism\\", Gaddafi constantly made revisions to this theory. Before the \\"Green Book\\", Islam was considered one of the ideological sources of official ideology, but the third part of this book, which appeared in the summer of 1979, did not assess its truthfulness on the basis of the precepts of Islam. On the contrary, \\"the truth\\" of Islamic provisions themselves was evaluated in terms of their compatibility with the theory. It was declared that the driving force of history was national and social struggle. At the same time, as Gaddafi specified, \\"if we were to restrict ourselves to the support of Muslims only, that would be an example of bigotry and selfishness: True Islam is the one that defends the weak, even if they are not Muslims\\".Kudelev V.V. \\"The situation in Libya\\", Journal of the Russia in Global Affairs. - 2007. - ‚Ññ 1, pp. 32 In the subsequent explanations and comments on the \\"Green Book\\", many of its provisions underwent significant revisions while still remaining the basic catechism of ideology in Libya.  Implementation in Libya  The theory was partially implemented in Libya. In March 1977, the \\"Declaration of Sabha\\" was declared, and the republic was transformed into a Jamahiriya (the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya). Those forms of private ownership which were deemed exploitative were abolished (whereas private family businesses in the service sector were preserved). With the advent of globalization and the information revolution Gaddafi slightly modified his theory by introducing a thesis about the era of large spaces in which the nation-state is becoming inviable. The word \\"Jamahiriya\\" ( ', approximately \\"[state] of the masses\\") is an Arabic neologism. It is the feminine nisba adjective formed from the term \\"Jamahir\\" (masses). It echoes the Arabic term for \\"Republic\\", \\"Jumhuriyah\\" (formally the feminine nisba adjective from Jumhur \\"people\\") . Gaddafi's \\"Jamahiriya\\" form of government was supposed to be different from both the monarchy and the republic, hence the name of \\"Third\\" International Theory.Kiselev SA Muammar Gaddafi - the theorist of the Third International Theory / / Vedomosti. - 2003. - ‚Ññ 10. with. 13 Politics and government of Libya under Gaddafi Under Gaddafi, Libya was governed by a military regime professing the idea of Arab nationalism, socialism, and Islam. The highest state authority was the General People's Congress (GPC), consisting of representatives of People's Committees. In practice, the GPC had the functions of a parliament. Its members were elected at local and regional levels, although part of them were assigned by Gaddafi personally. Gaddafi also appointed his ministers from among the members of the GPC. While Gaddafi himself did not hold any official posts, he remained the leading political figure in Libya. Islam is the state religion of Libya, but the influence of the Muslim clergy is limited. Direct democracy has been declared in the country and oil revenues make it possible to maintain a high standard of living for the Libyan population. The presence of foreign capital is reduced, the enterprises in the sphere of large and medium industry are owned by the state. The basis of justice is the Quran. Judicial proceedings are conducted by a hierarchical system of courts. Small lawsuits are considered in the Magistrates' Courts. Next come the Courts of the First Stage, the Appellate Courts and the Supreme Court. The official main principle of government in Libya was: \\"Power, wealth and weapons - in the hands of the people.\\"Strokan S.N. Libya defends its principles / / Kommersant. - 2005. - ‚Ññ 243 / P (‚Ññ 3327), pp. 16 Modification of the theory in Libya The transformation of Libyan society into Jamahiriya was accompanied by many zigzags and went more slowly than Gaddafi intended. The system that he created may have aroused the Libyan people to political activism, but, as he had to admit, \\"popular participation in government was not complete\\".Vladimir Bogdanov.

It was about creating, instead of the primary public meetings (People's Congresses), 1500 communes, which are self- guided mini-states within a state, each with full authority within its district, including the allocation of budgetary funds.Efremov VS.

R. Martin and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996), Jorah is a knight in exile, the disgraced former lord of Bear Island and the only son of Jeor Mormont, the honorable lord commander of the Night's Watch. Jorah subsequently appeared in Martin's A Clash of Kings (1998), A Storm of Swords (2000) and A Dance with Dragons (2011). After fleeing Westeros, Jorah pledges fealty to Daenerys Targaryen and over the course of both the novels and the television show becomes her closest and most loyal companion; Jorah's passionate yet unrequited love of Daenerys is central to the character's arc in both the novels and television show. He is portrayed as a skilled warrior whose knowledge of the peoples and customs of Essos proves invaluable to Daenerys' journeys. Jorah is portrayed by the Scottish actor Iain Glen in the HBO television adaptation. Character=Background Ser Jorah Mormont is the only child of the Night's Watch's Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, who abdicated shortly before Robert's Rebellion to join the Night's Watch and let Jorah assume the lordship of Bear Island. At some point Jorah married a lady of House Glover, who died from miscarriage after ten years of marriage. Jorah fought in Greyjoy's Rebellion, distinguishing himself by being one of the first to enter the fray during the siege of Pyke and was knighted by King Robert Baratheon. At a tourney at Lannisport celebrating the Baratheon victory, Jorah fell in love with the beautiful Lynesse Hightower (aunt of Margaery Tyrell). He named her Queen of Love and Beauty after winning the tourney and asked her father for her hand in marriage, which he accepted. However, Lynesse found herself ill-suited to the rough life on Bear Island, having grown up as a member of the wealthy House Hightower. Jorah bankrupted himself trying to provide her with luxuries and eventually sold poachers found on his lands to a Tyroshi slaver to fund her lifestyle. His liege lord, Eddard Stark, condemned Jorah to death, but he and Lynesse fled to Lys. Jorah then made his living as a sellsword, but was still unable to provide enough to satisfy Lynesse, and eventually returned from a campaign to find that Lynesse had become a concubine of a wealthy Lysene merchant. The merchant warned Jorah that he would be enslaved to settle his debts if he remained in Lys and Jorah was forced to flee again. Afterwards he drifted among the Free Cities and the Dothraki, before becoming a spy for Varys. Jorah Mormont is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister. Jorah mostly serves to provide Daenerys with background information such as Westerosi history and the various cultures of Essos. Storylines Coat of arms of House Mormont A Game of Thrones In Pentos, Jorah enters the service of House Targaryen during Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo, although he is actually spying on behalf of Robert's Master of Whisperers Varys in hopes of earning a royal pardon. Although Jorah holds Daenerys' brother Viserys in contempt, he comes to admire Daenerys for her bravery and strength of character, and eventually falls in love with her. In Vaes Dothrak, Jorah is warned by Illyrio Mopatis that Robert has ordered Daenerys' assassination and saves her from being poisoned. After Drogo's death, Jorah is the first to pledge fealty to Daenerys and is astounded when she emerges from Drogo's funeral pyre with three dragon hatchlings. A Clash of Kings Jorah accompanies Daenerys and the remnants of her khalasar to Qarth. There, Jorah stops sending reports to Varys, having truly fallen in love with Daenerys. Daenerys discovers his love after Jorah notes her physical similarity to Lynesse, but does not tell Jorah that she knows. At Qarth's docks, Jorah and Daenerys encounter the former pit fighter Strong Belwas and his squire Arstan Whitebeard. Arstan claims to know Jorah; Jorah finds him familiar, but does not recognise him. Despite Jorah's mistrust, Daenerys accepts the duo into her service. A Storm of Swords Jorah confesses his love to Daenerys, who rejects his advances. Jorah recommends that they sail to Astapor to buy an army of Unsullied, and commands the army when they overthrow the masters of Yunkai. As they arrive at Meereen, Arstan is revealed to be Ser Barristan Selmy, former Kingsguard to Aerys II Targaryen and Robert, and he announces Jorah's former status as a spy. Daenerys orders Jorah and Selmy to infiltrate Meereen and release slaves. Upon their return, Jorah refuses to beg forgiveness, insisting that Daenerys owes him forgiveness as reward for his service. Daenerys agrees but notes that she cannot grant it without undermining her authority, and banishes Jorah. A Dance With Dragons Jorah encounters the exiled Tyrion Lannister in a brothel in Selhorys and abducts him, hoping to return to Daenerys' graces by presenting a Lannister captive as a gift. In Volantis they encounter the dwarf Penny, whom Tyrion takes pity on and is allowed by Jorah to accompany them. During their voyage to Meereen, their ship is disabled by a storm and later seized by slavers, and Jorah is badly beaten and branded trying to fend them off. In Meereen the trio are sold to the Yunkish master Yezzan zo Qaggaz. Jorah becomes despondent after learning that Daenerys has taken the Meereenese nobleman Hizdhar zo Loraq as her husband. When Yezzan dies from dysentery, Jorah and Tyrion escape to the camp of the sellsword company Second Sons, formerly in service to Daenerys before defecting to the slavers, and Jorah rejoins the company along with Tyrion. Jorah realises that the Yunkai'i will lose the coming battle with Meereen and tells Tyrion that they need to convince the company to defect again. Family tree of House Mormont ;Notes TV adaptation Iain Glen plays the role of Jorah Mormont in the television series. Jorah Mormont is portrayed by Scottish actor Iain Glen in the television adaption of the series of books.  Season 1  Ser Jorah Mormont is an exiled knight in the service of Daenerys Targaryen and the son of Jeor Mormont of the Night's Watch. To fund his wife's extravagant lifestyle, he sold poachers on his land to slave traders, which is illegal in the Seven Kingdoms. Rather than face punishment by Lord Stark, he fled to Essos and learned the lifestyle of the Dothraki, who embrace him as one of their own and know him as \\"Jorah the Andal\\". Jorah serves as an adviser to the Targaryens on both political and cultural matters regarding the Seven Kingdoms and Essos. Jorah is actually spying on the Targaryens for Lord Varys in exchange for a pardon from Robert, but after learning more about Daenerys, it appears that Jorah is falling for her; even preventing her poisoning, when Robert & Varys so order it.  Season 2  When Daenerys is widowed after Khal Drogo's death, Jorah travels with her to Qarth and becomes the first knight of her Queensguard. He travels with Daenerys to Qarth, serving as her adviser and protector. When a mysterious, masked, female seuthsayer (privately) questions his fealty, he affirms that he will no longer help Varys, or anybody else, betray Daenerys. He explains to Daenerys that he respects her birthright claim to the Seven Kingdoms as she \\"has a kind heart\\", which he believes to be the key to being a just ruler. When Daenerys' dragons are stolen by the warlock Pyat Pree (a member of the Thirteen, the leaders of Qarth) and taken to the House of the Undying, Jorah accompanies her as she defeats her children's captor and departs Qarth for Astapor.  Season 3  After Daenerys sacks Astapor and defeats the slavers who own the city, Jorah plays an important part in the capture of Yunkai, together with Unsullied commander Grey Worm and Daario Naharis, Lieutenant and leader of the Second Sons. Led by Daario, the trio infiltrates the city and kills a number of Yunkish guards to open a gate, ensuring the city's capture. Jorah later assists Daenerys and her army in conquering Meereen, and later informs her of Joffrey's death, but at the same time dissuades her from invading King's Landing, since she is not strong enough to take all of Westeros yet. When Daenerys appears to begin a romantic relationship with Daario, Jorah voices his disapproval.  Season 4  Following Daenerys' capture of Meereen, Jorah joins her council and aids her in ruling the city and its nearby territories. However, another member of Daenerys' advisory council, Ser Barristan, uncovers the truth about Jorah's original mission in Essos, and presents the information to Daenerys. When it is revealed to her that Jorah spied on her for the \\"usurper\\" Robert Baratheon, which almost led to her poisoning by the wine merchant in Vaes Dothrak, she exiles Jorah from Meereen on the threat of death. Jorah subsequently departs alone, with his destination unclear.  Season 5  Jorah encounters Tyrion Lannister in Volantis and kidnaps him with the intention of delivering him to Daenerys. Sailing through the ruins of Valyria, the duo is assaulted by \\"stone men\\" ‚Äì humans turned insane by the disease greyscale ‚Äì and Jorah is infected in the struggle. He decides to hide this information from Tyrion. Jorah then learns from Tyrion that his father Jeor was killed in a Night's Watch mutiny beyond the Wall. The pair are captured by slavers and sold into the fighting pits in Meereen. At a demonstration of pit fighters, Jorah encounters Daenerys, who orders him freed but refuses to let him return to her service. With nowhere else left to go, Jorah returns to the fighting pits. At the reopening of the fighting pits, Jorah foils an assassination attempt on Daenerys and protects her from the insurgent Sons of the Harpy in the resulting confrontation. After Daenerys flies away on Drogon, Jorah and Daario Naharis leave Meereen to look for her.  Season 6  Jorah and Daario discover Daenerys' intentionally discarded ring in a grass plain, and Jorah deduces that she has been captured by a Dothraki horde and taken to Vaes Dothrak. Upon arriving there, they are reunited with Daenerys, who rejects their offer to flee the city and instead asks them to help her with her own plan, to which they reluctantly agree. The next evening, Jorah and Daario watch as Daenerys, after trapping and burning all the Khals alive in the temple building, emerges from it completely unharmed, and they join the rest of the Dothraki in kneeling before her in awe. As Daenerys and her entourage prepare to leave Vaes Dothrak, Jorah reveals his greyscale to Daenerys and his intention to end his life before his illness overtakes him. Daenerys instead orders him to find a cure for his condition and return to her, declaring that she will need his counsel after conquering Westeros. Jorah then departs alone.  Season 7  Jorah returns to Westeros, seeking aid at the Citadel in Oldtown. By this time his greyscale has drastically progressed, consuming his entire arm and part of his torso. Archmaester Ebrose diagnoses Jorah's greyscale as untreatably advanced, and informs Jorah that he has six months of sanity left and will be exiled from the Citadel the next day. Samwell Tarly, who formerly served under Jeor in the Night's Watch, rediscovers a cure for greyscale. Despite being forbidden to administer it, because whoever treats the patient could become infected, he treats Jorah in secret and successfully heals Jorah's greyscale. Ebrose, although unimpressed by Jorah's attempts to conceal Sam's treatment, discharges Jorah. Jorah then returns to Daenerys, who is happy to see him and accepts him into her service once again. He then joins the expedition led by Jon Snow beyond the Wall to capture a wight and prove its existence to Cersei Lannister. He and Jon talk about their respective fathers, and Jon expresses his relief that Jorah was not executed. Jon attempts to return Longclaw to Jorah, on the basis that it is still the family sword of House Mormont, but Jorah refuses, claiming that he forfeited his right to claim the sword and that Jeor gave the weapon to Jon, making it his. Jorah survives the expedition and returns to Dragonstone.  Season 8  Jorah travels with Jon, Daenerys, and her forces to Winterfell to make a stand against the White Walkers. Daenerys is displeased with Tyrion when she learns that his sister Cersei Lannister is not sending her army, but she is mollified after Jorah speaks up in support of him. Samwell grants Jorah House Tarly's ancestral sword Heartsbane out of gratitude for Jeor's formative influence on him. During the Battle of Winterfell, Jorah is mortally wounded defending Daenerys from certain death at the hands of the undead, though he does survive long enough to see the army felled. Jorah dies in the arms of a sobbing Daenerys, encircled by the wings of her dragon, Drogon.

Seven years later, Harvard anthropologist Dennis Alan is in the Amazon rainforest studying rare herbs and medicines with a local shaman. He drinks a potion and experiences a hallucination of the same black man from Christophe's funeral, surrounded by corpses in a bottomless pit. Back in Boston, Alan is approached by a pharmaceutical company looking to investigate a drug used in Haitian Vodou to create zombies. The company wants Alan to acquire the drug for use as a \\"super anesthetic\\". The corporation provides Alan with funding and sends him to Haiti, which is in the middle of a revolution. Alan's exploration in Haiti, assisted by Doctor Marielle Duchamp, locates Christophe who is alive after having been buried seven years earlier. Alan is taken into custody, and the commander of the Tonton Macoute, Captain Dargent Peytraud‚Äìthe same man from Christophe's funeral and Alan's vision in the Amazon‚Äìwarns Alan to leave Haiti. Continuing his investigation, Alan finds a local man, Mozart, who is reported to have knowledge of the procedure for creating the zombie drug. Alan pays Mozart for a sample, but Mozart sells him rat poison instead. After embarrassing Mozart in public, Alan convinces Mozart to show Alan how to produce the drug for a fee of $1,000. Alan is arrested again by the Tonton Macoutes, and tortured by having a nail driven through his scrotum, and then dumped on a street with the message that he must leave Haiti or be killed. Alan again refuses to leave and meets with Mozart to create the drug. Alan has a nightmare of Peytraud, revealed to be a bokor who turns enemies into zombies and steals their souls. When Alan wakes up, he is lying next to Christophe's sister who has been decapitated. The Tonton Macoutes enter, take photos, and frame Alan for murder. Peytraud tells Alan to leave the country and never return, lest he be convicted of the murder, executed, and then his soul stolen by Peytraud. He puts Alan on a plane, but Mozart sneaks on board and gives Alan the zombie drug. Mozart asks Alan to tell people about him, so that Mozart can achieve international fame. Alan agrees and returns to Boston with his mission apparently completed. At a celebration dinner, the wife of Alan's employer is possessed by Peytraud, who warns Alan of his own imminent death. Alan returns to Haiti, where his only ally, a houngan named Lucien Celine, is killed by Peytraud and Mozart is beheaded as a sacrifice for Peytraud's power. Alan is then sprayed with the zombie powder and dies; later, Peytraud steals Alan's body from a medical clinic before the death can be reported to the US Embassy. Peytraud takes Alan to a graveyard where, helpless in his coffin, Alan sees that Peytraud has captured Marielle and will sacrifice her. Peytraud shows Alan Celine's soul in a canari. Alan is then buried alive with a tarantula to \\"keep him company\\". Waking up in his coffin a few hours later, Alan is rescued by Christophe who was also turned into a zombie by Peytraud. Having escaped Peytraud's trap, Alan returns to the Tonton Macoute headquarters looking for Marielle. There, Alan defeats Peytraud through a battles of wills, using Celine's white magic to drive a nail into Peytraud's groin, and sends his soul to hell. As the Haitian people celebrate the downfall of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Marielle proclaims \\"The nightmare is over\\".

During production in Haiti, the local government informed the cast and crew that they could not guarantee their safety for the remainder of the film's shoot because of the political strife and civil turmoil that was occurring during that time; as a result, production was relocated to the Dominican Republic for the remainder of the shoot. Release=Rating In an interview, Craven stated that unlike his previous films that had problems with the Motion Picture Association of America, the first cut got an R rating without any problems. According to an article from Fangoria #71, the original cut was three hours long but Craven felt that it was too long and talky so it was cut down to 98 minutes. It was then test screened to the audience and their reactions were favorable. Box office The Serpent and the Rainbow was released theatrically in the United States by Universal Pictures on February 5, 1988. It grossed $19,595,031 at the box office. Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Serpent and the Rainbow holds an approval rating of 65%, based on 34 reviews, and an average rating of 5.8/10. Its consensus reads, \\"Although it's occasionally overwhelmed by excessive special effects, The Serpent and the Rainbow draws on a chilling atmosphere to deliver a intelligent, politically informed story.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie three stars out of a possible four, praising Pullman's performance and the \\"stunning\\" visuals, while also noting The Serpent and the Rainbow seemed to take Haitain voodoo more seriously as a religion and cultural force than most horror movies with similar themes, which merely use voodoo as a \\"gimmick\\".https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-serpent-and-the-rainbow-1988 Home media The film was first released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 1998, though this version is now out of print. It was subsequently re-released by Universal Studios in 2003 and in 2016 on Blu-ray from Scream Factory.

The Augusta Chronicle, Pg. G3. It has since been published in newspapers, books, and as a webcomic. The story takes place in the land of Dikay, a country fraught with undeath, and focuses on the warrior Van Von Hunter and his \\"never-ending fight against evil...stuff\\". The opening of the series and Von Hunter's presence gives the series a Castlevania-like feel, but essentially the comic spoofs role-playing games, fantasy creatures and folklore (in one instance Von Hunter slays an Irish pixie), among other things. Publication history The series has been released in three printed volumes by Tokyopop in North America, after Van Von Hunter: Circlet of Necromancy won a first-place trophy and $1,000 in Tokyopop's first Rising Stars of Manga contest.Publishers Weekly Staff (March 17, 2003). \\"Rising Star Winners; Battle Royale Ahead\\". Publishers Weekly, Pg. 28.Levy, Stu (Publisher) (April 2003). Rising Stars of Manga, Vol. 1, Los Angeles: Tokyopop. Pg. 32 The manga series runs a storyline that takes place after the events in the webcomic. In summer 2006, Van Von Hunter started a 6-month run of the Sunday newspapers. It was syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, with about 30 papers in North America and one in Sweden publishing the strip, including the Los Angeles Times, The Denver Post, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The Detroit News, The Oregonian, The Vancouver Sun, and the Toronto Sun.Memmott, Carol (December 29, 2005). \\"Comics pages make room for manga; Newspapers target the young\\". USA Today, Pg. 1D.Chin, Richard (February 5, 2006). \\"Funnies fans, prepare to meet manga\\". St. Paul Pioneer Press, Pg. 1E. Van von Hunter was the second Tokyopop manga to be syndicated to newspapers. The first was Peach Fuzz by Jared Hodges and Lindsay Cibos. The comic's anniversary falls on Valentine's Day (February 14), which is jokingly referred to as Von Hunter Day on the site (after Van decided that anyone who didn't want to celebrate Valentine's Day should have an alternative). Characters *Van Von Hunter ‚Äì The hero of our story, Von Hunter is a jovial and easygoing adventurer who, for whatever reason, is dedicated to battling the forces of evil. He always introduces himself as \\"Van Von Hunter, mighty warrior and hunter of evil... stuff!\\" While not the sharpest sword in the armory, Von Hunter makes up for his shortcomings with irrepressible optimism, a strong sense of justice, a certain degree of cunning, and excellent armed-combat skills. Changed his name to Hunter to suit his profession; he was originally named Van Von Vaughn. *Van Von Hunter's Sidekick ‚Äì A lovely young woman whom Von Hunter rescued from Count Disdain one fine day. Until the day she visited Von Hunter's mansion and was accidentally hit on the head with the flat of a battleaxe, she never got a chance to introduce herself. Afterwards, she lost her memory and was unable to introduce herself. She tags along with Von Hunter because she has nowhere else to go. This sidekick doesn't do much fighting, but her common sense has thankfully saved Von Hunter's bacon more than once. Recently, she became willingly engaged to Prince Lesley‚Äîthough only because she wants to be a princess. However, she appears to have ended the relationship after learning the Prince's real name. *Prince Lesley Mortermer Lemorte ‚Äì Better known by his own ill-chosen title, the Flaming Prince rules over Dikay Kingdom at the wish of his truly wicked father. He is Van Von Hunter's self-proclaimed sworn nemesis, and, fortunately for our hero, is even dimmer than Von Hunter himself. Enjoys crushing random objects in his hand. The Flaming Prince, in his vendetta against Von Hunter, employs ghastly minions to dispose of him, including mummies, skeletons, a fearsome Beast, and even goblins. Not a one has proved useful so far, aside from a goblin-run bakesale to restore the kingdom's treasury. Recently, he has kidnapped Von Hunter's sidekick, intending to force her to marry him. However, his plan is currently stalling while his doomsday device warps reality. In the most recent comic, it has been hinted that his father (or another relative) is a vampire. *The Man in the Dark Glasses ‚Äì The Flaming Prince's answer to Von Hunter's sidekick, only male and much more cooperative with his employer's idiocy. He is actually less a servant than the Prince's right-hand man; providing encouragement, thoughtful advice, and random things to crush, he's really the glue that holds the kingdom together. Considering that he has never received thanks for his support, this is impressive in itself. Webcomic has hinted he has a name; \\"Better than your name,\\" the Flaming Prince says to his servant after Sidekick makes fun of the prince's name. *The Archmage Ariana Rael ‚Äì A cute little girl who blew up her village when they tried to feed her to a dragon, she was hired by the Flaming Prince as a secret weapon. When Von Hunter arrived to do battle with the Prince, Ariana was supposed to destroy him with her powerful pyromancy, the Mega-Destruction Flare. Instead, she simply blew up everything surrounding him. Ari ended up traveling with our heroes for a time, until they discovered that she was evil and ditched her. One could hardly blame them: Ari drinks, smokes and blows things up with reckless abandon, all the things girls shouldn't do. Recently, she enrolled at Warthogs School of Magic to steal whatever powerful item they might possess. While failing to obtain the Philopher's Stone, she has learned a spell even worse than the Flare, Apoxageddon. *Vengeance Joe ‚Äì No one really knows who this man is‚Äîbesides the name \\"Vengeance Joe\\" ‚Äì or where he comes from. But one thing is certain: once angered, nothing will stop him from finding his revenge. His list of grudges is long and varied, ranging from a staircase (for tripping him) to a tree (for getting in his way) to even the blissfully ignorant Von Hunter (for not introducing himself as they passed each other on the street). He is now questing to carry out his vengeance on Von Hunter by destroying all that the righteous warrior cares for. He is allergic to walnuts. Monsters There are many types of monsters in Von Hunter's world, though not all are very fearsome. *Zombies ‚Äì Zombies seem to get appointed for the jobs that no one else wants in Von Hunter's world, from lawyers to accountants. They also display lower than average intelligence which makes them more harmful than useful. Wanted posters in zombie-infested woods can be seen as \\"zombie deflectors\\". *Orcs ‚Äì Used to comprise a large portion of the prince's army before being wiped out by Ari. Like seen in most medium, they are large and dangerous looking. The prince prefers them as servants over goblins for obvious reasons. *Goblins ‚Äì More cute than deadly, goblins wear hats and outfits that make them resemble Christmas Elves to a degree. Regardless they are by far the most useful of the prince's forces (despite his apparent dislike for them) as they fill some of the menial chores, such as bar-tending, can be bizarrely versatile, and were able to restore the kingdom's finances through bakesales. They are apparently talented chefs, and mesmerized Von Hunter's Sidekick with brownies in the print version. *Mummies ‚Äì Similar to zombies but less useful as they are wrapped too tightly and can not move very quickly. *The Beast ‚Äì Supposedly unleashed to kill Von Hunter, this minotaur- like monster, after being locked up for millennia, immediately began hogging a nearby toilet. Soon after he got stuck in a brunch-line and was later set on fire by a demon before the Prince's doomsday device turned it into a potted plant. In the book, he had a case of food poisoning. *Vampires- Vampires are undead beings, though not always humans, with fangs and pointed ears. They feed on blood and turn to dust when staked through the heart. Vampires are the rulers of the unnamed country were the webcomic opens. *Ghouls- Ghouls are bald, and have pointed ears, fangs and nails. Ghouls eat humans and founded the country the webcomic opens in. *Trolls- Large and grotesque looking creature seen at a monster's bar. *Leprechaun- Tiny little men with beards and pointed ears. *Dragons- Giant lizard-like creatures with bat-like wings and horns. *Werewolves- People who transform into half-wolf monsters during the full moon. *Sasquatch- A large, hairy, ape-like creature. *Pollywacker- A monster in the Mysterious forest of the accursed valley of the Twelve Severed Heads, who terrorized the Valley until von Hunter killed it. *Gargoyles- Large winged monsters called \\"stoners\\" by the Prince. The Gargoyles of Von Hunter's world behave similar to stereotypical stoner teenagers. *Bugs- The Insects (and most likely arachnids like spiders) are sentient creatures with their own society. They are still just as small, however. Their leader, Lord Chitin, was inadvertently killed by the Flaming Prince early on. *Demons- The only demon seen in the webcomic is a large and ferocious-looking monster, similar in appearance to the Balrog. However, it is comforts the Beast when The Flaming Prince scolds it and is used to serve hot drinks. *Hybrids- To combat Von Hunter, The Flaming Prince had several combinations of monsters created. These were: a goblin-orc creature (a fat goblin), a weresasquatch (a very hairy creature that would get even hairier during the full moon), and a combination of five dragons (a five-headed dragon whose heads attacked one another). Live-Action Movie In 2010, Van Von Hunter was adapted as a live-action film directed and written by Steven Calcote and Stuart J. Levy. It stars Yuri Lowenthal, Heather Marie Marsden, and Lucas Bridgeman. It won Levy and Calcote \\"Best Director\\" at Mockfest 2011. Collections Starting in 2005, Tokyopop published a series of graphic novels set in the Van Von Hunter universe, taking place several years after the conclusion of the webcomic's plot. * Van Von Hunter volume 1. .

TOKYOPOP. 2006-12-12 Reception Carlo Santos of Anime News Network stated: \\"For those who have grown tired of the fantasy genre's ridiculous self-importance and constantly recycled clich√©s, Van Von Hunter is the antidote, attacking these clich√©s with irreverent fervor. However, in doing so it becomes something of a clich√© itself, relying on a predictable comedic approach and putting its characters in overused situations‚Äînot to mention that the whole adventure-comedy thing has been done plenty of times before.\\" Reviewing the webcomic, Dani Atkinson of Sequential Tart stated that the black and white artstyle of Van Von Hunter is initially fairly \\"crude\\", but evolved into a more crisp tone as the series continued.

Built in 1979, it was 106 m high and had 32 floors of which 29 were above ground level and 3 below, thus ranking it as the eighth tallest building in Madrid (and 23rd in Spain). The building was gutted by a huge fire on February 12, 2005, and partially collapsed; it has since been demolished.  Characteristics of the building  The building, located at Calle Raimundo Fern√°ndez Villaverde 65, had a total area of and was one of the first modern towers in Madrid. The tower was designed in 1974 by a team of six important Spanish architects and was constructed between 1975 and 1979. Its distinctive appearance was due to its elemental geometry, lacking composite elements. Its fa√ßade was completely covered by reflective glass-like panels that mirrored the sky of Madrid, diminishing its visual impact. The structure was divided into two halves by a mechanical floor without windows. It was a very solid building, with a central core of reinforced concrete that resisted the high temperatures of the fire without collapsing. The building did not have a fire sprinkler system. Sprinklers were being retrofitted, but they were not yet operable when the building was destroyed by fire.Standing Committee on Structural Safety, \\"The Fire at Torre Windsor Office Building, Madrid 2005\\"  Disaster  Around midnight, on Saturday, February 12, 2005, a fire was detected on the 21st floor of the building. The fire spread quickly throughout the entire building, leading to the collapse of the outermost, steel parts of the upper floors. It took firefighters about 24 hours to extinguish the fire. In the aftermath, seven firefighters were injured, but nobody was killed during the disaster. However, the building was a total loss, which was arguably the worst in Madrid's history. The fire was blamed on an electrical fault. The city council of Madrid covered the cost of demolishing the remains of the building, thought to be some EUR 22 million (USD $32.5 million). Demolition was completed in August 2005, and a 23-story replacement called Torre Titania was built from 2007 to 2011.

Designed by the Mikoyan Design Bureau and built by the Moscow Aircraft Production Association, the MiG-AT made its first flight in March 1996. It is the first joint aircraft development programme between Russia and France and the first military collaborative project between Russia and the West to reach first flight. The design lost out to the Yakovlev Yak-130 in 2002 in the competition for a government contract, and had also been unsuccessfully marketed to countries such as India, Greece, and those of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Design and development The design effort on the MiG-AT began when Soviet authorities looked to replace the country's ageing fleet of Aero L-29 and L-39 military trainer aircraft. The project competed with proposals from the design bureaux of Sukhoi, Myasishchev and Yakovlev; in 1992, the designs of the two former firms were eliminated, leaving the MiG-AT and Yak-130 as the sole contenders for a government contract. Due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent fall in defence spending, Mikoyan entered into collaboration with French firms Snecma/Turbomeca and Sextant Avionique (later Thales Avionics), who would provide the aircraft engines and avionics, respectively. Following the freezing of the MiG-AT's final design in early 1994, the Moscow Aircraft Production Association (MAPO) started fabricating the first prototype. The two companies, which would merge in 1995 to form MAPO-MiG, used their own funds for the construction of the aircraft.} The first MiG-AT (81 White) was rolled out in May 1995, before it was transferred to Zhukovsky, where it made a short initial \\"hop\\" in early March 1996. Its official first flight, however, took place on 21 March 1996, when Roman Taskayev took the aircraft aloft for 45 minutes, accompanied by a MiG-29UB and an L-39 acting as chase planes. The aircraft reached a height of and a speed of . The second prototype joined the flight test programme in October 1997; by then, the first aircraft had accumulated more than 200 test flights. Mikoyan had originally planned to conduct the test programme using three flying prototypes and a static aircraft and also to construct about fifteen additional aircraft for its joint international marketing effort with Snecma. The MiG-AT is more conventional than the competing Yak-130. It has a low-set, straight wing, engines mounted on either side of the fuselage and a mid-mounted tail. The first aircraft had avionics that had been jointly developed by Sextant Avionique and GosNIIAS that was derived from prior French software. The avionics system comprised multi-function liquid crystal displays, a head-up display and other navigation systems, some of which used commercial technology to shorten development time. The avionics systems, when working with the MiG-AT's fly-by-wire flight- control system, allowed the aircraft to adopt the characteristics of third- and fourth-generation jet fighters. The second prototype differed from the first in having Russian avionics and hardpoints for the carriage of armament. MiG-AT at MAKS-2007 airshow The aircraft is powered by two Snecma-Turbomeca Larzac 04R20 turbofan engines, rated at , that had been developed in the 1970s for the Alpha Jet. Under a 1995 agreement between French and Russian authorities, the Russian side reserved the right to locally produce and develop a higher thrust derivative of the engine. In November 1996, a contract was signed for the production of ten Larzac engines for the initial pre- production aircraft, which did not come into fruition. At the same time, the was working on a Russian alternative to the Larzac, named the , rated at at take-off. Both aircraft prototypes later served as a separate test beds for the RD-1700 and NPO Saturn AL-55I engine. As the tender for a military trainer progressed, operational experience in the air force and pressure from foreign participating companies shifted the original requirements for a purely trainer aircraft to one that encompassed a light combat capability. In mid-March 2002, Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Mikhailov stated that the Yak-130 had been chosen over the MiG-AT as the air force's new trainers, only for the media to subsequently report that both aircraft had been chosen. The Yak-130, however, was said to be superior as it could serve the dual role of a trainer and combat jet, and in the end, on 10 April 2002, it was announced that the Yak-130 had indeed been selected over the MiG-AT. Mikoyan protested the decision, in particular the expanded requirements for a lightweight combat trainer, and the weapons load requirement that was apparently too great for such physically-inadequate designs. By then, the two prototypes had amassed 750 flights. An aspect of the Mikoyan's original 1993 agreement with the French companies was that the latter would assist in the marketing of the MiG- AT outside the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In particular, the agreement was intended to add credibility to the project, and to draw on Snecma's international business network. Aside from the CIS, Russia would market the aircraft to countries that had traditionally purchased the country's aircraft, including India and Malaysia. The aircraft was demonstrated to officials and pilots of such countries as Algeria, Greece, India and the United Arab Emirates. Despite the loss in 2002 to the Yakovlev design, Mikoyan proceeded with discussions with prospective overseas partners and continuing flight-test programme. In February 2004, the design received its Russian military certification, and it was expected that Algeria would be the first to place an order for the aircraft. In June 2018, vice president of the United Aircraft Corporation Sergei Korotkov announced the Russian Defence Ministry is considering a revival of the program and possibility of using the aircraft as a main platform for base training of pilots. Further, it was reported by Viktor Bondarev if the decision is taken, the aircraft may be introduced to the Russian Air Force in 2023.

Married, single, divorced, and widowed are examples of civil status. Civil status and marital status are terms used in forms, vital records, and other documents to ask or indicate whether a person is married or single. In the simplest contexts, no further distinction is made. A status of married means that a person was wed in a manner legally recognized by their jurisdiction. A person's specified civil status might also be married if they are in a civil union or common-law marriage. The civil status of a person who is legally separated is married. Whether a cohabiting couple (such as in a domestic partnership) have a civil status of \\"married\\" depends on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. In addition to those who have never married, single status applies to people whose relationship with a significant other is not legally recognized. Questions about civil status appear on questionnaires for quantitative research, such as census forms and market research instruments. In a person's medical history, civil status is considered to have both quantitative and qualitative significance. A government records the civil status of its citizens by means of a civil registration system. Historically, inquiries into marital status have also appeared on applications for employment, loans, and credit. Familial status indicates whether a person is the responsible caregiver for a child.

He derived equations that describe properties of glass electrodes as well as other types of ion-selective electrodes depending on chemical structure and multi-component composition of glass, concurrent interference of ions (see Nikolsky-Eisenman equation and Nikolsky-Shultz-Eisenman thermodynamic ion-exchange theory of GE–®—É–ª—å—Ü –ú. –ú. –ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–µ–≤–æ–π —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–∏ —Å—Ç–µ–∫–ª—è–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤. –£—á—ë–Ω—ã–µ –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –õ–ì–£ ‚Ññ 169. –°–µ—Ä–∏—è —Ö–∏–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—É–∫ ‚Ññ 13. 1953. —Å—Ç—Ä. 80-156 (Shultz, M.M.

In preparation for the game, a prize (or \\"gift\\") is wrapped in a large number of layers of wrapping paper or reusable fabric bags of different sizes. Usually, each layer is of a different design so they can be easily distinguished. Smaller prizes or mottos may be placed between some or all other layers of wrapping. During the game, music is played as the parcel is passed around. Whoever is holding the parcel when the music is stopped removes one layer of wrapping and claims any prize found under that layer. The music is then restarted and the game continues until every layer is removed and the main prize claimed. The stopping and starting of the music is usually done by an adult who is not taking part in the game. While they should not observe the game in order for it to be fair, in practice they often do to ensure that every participant has a turn, that prizes are well distributed and perhaps that the child whose party it is claims the main prize (or to ensure that a guest claims the prize). A fairer alternative is to prepare recordings of short snatches of music. Variations on the game include allowing participants to remove as many layers of paper as possible (rather than just one) before the music restarts, and including challenges or forfeits on slips of paper in place of mottos.

Bernardino de Mendoza was born in Guadalajara, Spain around 1540, as the son of Don Alonso Suarez de Mendoza, third Count of Coru√±a and Vicecount of Torija, and Do√±a Juana Jimenez de Cisneros. In 1560, he joined the army of Philip II and for more than 15 years fought, he in the Low Countries under the command of Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba. During that period, he participated in the Spanish military actions at (among others) Haarlem, Mookerheyde and Gembloux. In 1576, he was appointed a member of the military Order of St. James (Orden militar de Santiago) in recognition of those military achievements. In 1578, Philip II sent Mendoza as his ambassador to London. There, he acted not only as diplomat but also as a spy, using a variety of secret codes in the reports that he returned to Spain. He was expelled from England in 1584, after his involvement in Francis Throckmorton's plot against Elizabeth I was revealed. Crucial to that plot was his correspondence with Phillip II, using a code known only to himself and the king that they had learnt years earlier. For the next six years, Bernardino de Mendoza served as Spanish ambassador to the King of France. As the effective agent of Philip's interventionist foreign policy, Mendoza acted in concert with the Catholic League for which he acted as paymaster by funnelling to the Guise faction Habsburg funds; he encouraged it to try, by popular riots, assassinations and military campaigns, to undercut any moderate Catholic party that offered a policy of rapprochement with the Huguenots. The militant Mendoza and his master considered them as nothing more than heretics who needed to be crushed and rooted out like an infection.Leonardo, Dalia M. \\"Cut off this rotten member\\": The Rhetoric of Heresy, Sin, and Disease in the Ideology of the French Catholic League\\" The Catholic Historical Review 88.2, (April 2002:247-262). His role in backing the extremist Catholic House of Guise became so public that King Henry III demanded his recall. In 1591, with the Catholic League in disarray after the assassination of Henry I, Duke of Guise, he resigned for ill health. His eyesight had been deteriorating for years, and by the time of his return to Spain, he had become completely blind. His last years were spent in his house in Madrid. Many of his dispatches to Madrid were first deciphered only in the Simancas archives by De Lamar Jensen;Jensen 1964. they revealed, for the first time, Mendoza's role in organising and co-ordinating the Paris riots led by the Duke of Guise, known as the Day of the Barricades (12 May 1588), which had been presented as a spontaneous rising of the people and timed to coincide with the sailing of the Spanish Armada. Among Mendoza's public writings is a famous account of the war in the Low Countries that is entitled Comentario de lo sucecido en los Paises Bajos desde el a√±o 1567 hasta el de 1577. Bernardino also published a book on the art of warfare, under the title The√≥rica y pr√°ctica de la guerra and a Spanish translation of the Politicorum sive civilis doctrinae libri sex of the Flemish philosopher Justus Lipsius.

Born in 1890, Underwood received his B.A. from Yale in 1920 and a M.A. from Harvard in 1923. After opening an office in Los Angeles that year, he became associated with Daniel Ray Hull of the National Park Service. This led to a commission with the Utah Parks Company of the Union Pacific Railroad which was developing the parks in hopes of producing destinations for travelers. During this time Underwood designed lodges for Cedar Breaks National Monument (now demolished), Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. His surviving Utah Parks Company buildings are considered exceptional examples of the Rustic style of architecture, and are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, Underwood was contracted to design Yosemite National Park's The Ahwahnee, also on the National Register and probably his greatest triumph in the Rustic style. Inside Omaha's Union Station (1931) Underwood also designed stations for the Union Pacific, culminating in the magnificent Art Deco style station in Omaha in 1931. Then Underwood joined the Federal Architects Project in 1932. While working for the federal government, Underwood produced the preliminary designs for the Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, and went on to design more than 20 post offices, two major federal buildings, and the U.S. State Department Building. From 1947 to 1949, he was appointed as federal supervisory architect. Following retirement but utilizing an association with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and the Williamsburg Lodge project in Virginia, Underwood designed as his last major commission the Jackson Lake Lodge (1950‚Äì1954), Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. He died in 1960.

For social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and travesti roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the pantomime traditionally contains a role for a \\"principal boy\\", a breeches role played by a young woman, and also one or more pantomime dames, female comic roles played by men. Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of Victorian burlesque, there were usually one or more breeches roles. Etymology The word means \\"disguised\\" in French. Depending on sources, the term may be given as travesty,*Budden, Julian (1992), 'Travesty' in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, p 799 travesti,Kennedy, Michael (2006), The Oxford Dictionary of Music, p 899*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), The Oxford Dictionary of Opera, p 716 or en travesti. The Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English explains the origin of the latter term as \\"pseudo-French\\",According to Speake and LaFlaur (1999), the phrase itself is not recorded in French, and derives from the misinterpretation of travesti (the past participle of the French verb travestir) as a noun. although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. Biblioth√®que musicale du Th√©√¢tre de l'op√©ra (1876), La revue des deux mondes (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.See, for example Duron (2008) p. 231 and Coste (2004) pp. 26 and 141 Men in female roles The famous castrato Farinelli caricatured in one of his female roles Until the late 17th century in England and the late 18th century in the Papal StatesThe ban on women performing on stage was imposed by Pope Sixtus V in 1588. It was never legally enforceable in the Legations (Bologna, Ferrara and the Romagna) and was occasionally disapplied in Rome too, in particular from 1669 (during the papacy of erstwhile librettist Clement IX) to 1676, at the instigation of Queen Christina of Sweden, who was a fan of opera (Celletti, Rodolfo (2000). La grana della voce. Opere, direttori e cantanti (2nd edition). Rome: Baldini & Castoldi; chapter: \\"Nella Roma del Seicento\\", p. 37 ff ). The ban remained in force until 1798 when the French invaded Rome and a Roman Republic was proclaimed (Kantner, Leopold M, and Pachovsky, Angela (1998). 6: La Cappella musicale Pontificia nell'Ottocento. Rome: Hortus Musicus; p. 24 ).‚Äîalthough not elsewhere in EuropeWomen were banned from Lisbon's stages too for several decades in the latter half of the 18th century. The prohibition, however, was not generally observed throughout the Portuguese Empire‚Äînot even in Oporto and occasionally in Lisbon itself (Rog√©rio Budasz (2019). Opera in the Tropics. Music and Theater in Early Modern Brazil. New York: Oxford University Press; p. 238. )‚Äîwomen were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in drag because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral. In theatre As a boy player, Alexander Cooke is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as Agrippina in Ben Jonson's Sejanus His Fall.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 114‚Äì15. With the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. Edward Kynaston, whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's Epicoene and Evadne in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy, was one of the last of the era's boy players.Howe (1992) p. 25. London's Shakespeare's Globe theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original Globe Theatre, continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of Henry V in 1997,\\"Audience plays its part in Shakespeare's wooden O\\". The Independent, 7 June 1997 while Mark Rylance played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of Antony and Cleopatra.\\"Meet Mr Cleopatra\\". BBC News, 27 January 1999 Travesti roles for men are still to be found in British pantomime, where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the pantomime dame.See, e.g., \\"Panto's merriest widow\\". The Telegraph, 14 December 2005, accessed 7 February 2011 In opera Castrati, adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas - initially in female roles. In the first performance of Monteverdi's Orfeo in 1607 the roles of Eurydice and Proserpina were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the Papal States, where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the end of the 18th century. An exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.Senelick (2000) p. 177 In Lully's 1686 opera Armide the hero (Renaud) was sung by a haute-contre (a type of high tenor voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In Rameau's 1733 Hippolyte et Aricie, the hero (Hippolyte) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three Fates and Tisiphone were scored for basses and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's Plat√©e is also for an haute-contre. Female roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's 1890 opera H√§nsel und Gretel was originally written for a mezzo-soprano, but was sung by the tenor Philip Langridge in the Metropolitan Opera's 2009 production directed by Richard Jones.Metropolitan Opera (2009). \\"Sweet and Low-Down\\" Azio Corghi's 2005 opera Il dissoluto assolto, which incorporates story elements from Mozart's Don Giovanni, casts a countertenor in the role of the mannequin of Donna Elvira.Moiraghi, p. 324 In dance The portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in Renaissance court balletLee (2202) p. 54 and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abb√© J√©r√¥me Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: \\"Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers.\\"quoted in Harris-Warrick (2005) p. 38 Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: \\"What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?\\" In the original production of The Sleeping Beauty in 1890, a male dancer, Enrico Cecchetti, created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.Brillarelli (1995) p. 31. In Frederick Ashton's 1948 choreography of Cinderella, Robert Helpmann and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. Ben Stevenson later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet.Upper (2004) p. 66 Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in La Sylphide and the Widow Simone in La fille mal gard√©e. Women in male roles The ballerina Eug√©nie Fiocre as a matador circa 1860 With the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men.See Howe (1992) Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in travesti roles were Mary Anne Keeley who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby and the robber Jack Sheppard in Buckstone's play based on his life; Maude Adams who played Peter Pan in the American premiere of Barrie's play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times;Harbin, Marra, and Schanke (2005) p. 15 and Sarah Bernhardt who created the role of Napoleon II of France in Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon, played Lorenzino de' Medici in Musset's Lorenzaccio, Pell√©as in Maeterlinck's Pell√©as and M√©lisande and perhaps most famously played the title role in Hamlet. In the Victorian era, musical burlesques generally included several breeches roles. According to the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, although \\"an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency.\\"Schwandt, Erich et al. \\"Burlesque\\", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 One of the specialists in these roles was Nellie Farren who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including Robert the Devil, Little Jack Sheppard and Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√©.Culme, John. Information \\"Nellie Farren (1848‚Äì1904) English burlesque actress\\" at Footlight Notes, 2003, accessed 8 February 2011 In British pantomime, which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or Principal boy is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.Taylor (2007) pp. 117 and passim The practice of women performing en travesti in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as castrato singers went out of fashion and were replaced by mezzo-sopranos or contraltos in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of Rossini's 1813 Tancredi was specifically written for a female singer. However, travesti mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both Handel and Mozart, sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro. In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was Richard Strauss, who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier and the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos. From 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the corps de ballet portraying matadors, hussars, and cavaliers, and even as the prima ballerina's 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France.Garafola (1985) p. 35.

Painting by Thomas Rowlandson (1756‚Äì1827). Announcement of the annual race for Doggett's Coat and Badge. Doggett's Coat and Badge is the prize and name for the oldest rowing race in the world. Up to six apprentice watermen of the River Thames in England compete for this prestigious honour, which has been held every year since 1715. The 4 miles 5 furlongs (7.44 km) race is rowed on the River Thames upstream from London Bridge to Cadogan Pier, Chelsea, passing under a total of eleven bridges en route. Originally, it was raced every 1 August against the outgoing (falling or ebb) tide, in the boats used by watermen to ferry passengers across the Thames. Today it is raced at a date and time, often in September, that coincides with the incoming (rising or flood) tide, in contemporary single sculling boats. The winner's prize is a traditional watermen's red coat with a silver badge added, displaying the horse of the House of Hanover and the word \\"Liberty\\", in honour of the accession of George I to the throne. In addition, each competitor who completes the course receives a miniature of a Doggett's Badge for their lapel in a ceremony at Watermen's Hall, in silver for the winner and in bronze for the others. Monetary prizes are also awarded by the Fishmongers' Company to the rowing clubs of those taking part, with ¬£1,000 to the winner's club, ¬£600 for second, ¬£400 for third and ¬£200 for fourth. In addition to the prizes received, winning Doggett's Coat and Badge in the 18th and 19th centuries would help attract more trade to the talented waterman. While this is no longer the case, winning the Doggett's Coat and Badge is today still seen as very prestigious. History Three winners of the race. Pictured, left to right, are: J. J. Turferry (winner in 1900), W. H. Campbell (1850), A. H. Brewer (1901) Frederick William Pearce's badge from winning the 1916 Doggett's race pictured alongside his father and previous winner from 1894, both wearing the Doggett's coats Twenty winners pictured in 1908 \\"Liddy, the Winner of Doggett's Coat and Badge\\" Illustrated London News, 6 August 1842 Thomas Doggett was an Irish actor and comedian who became joint manager of Drury Lane Theatre. He relied heavily upon the watermen of the Thames, who were then the equivalent of the modern taxi driver, to convey him between the various plying stairs near his workplaces in the City of London and his residence in Chelsea. There is a legend that in 1715 Doggett was rescued by a waterman after falling overboard whilst crossing the Thames near Embankment. Although this has always been dismissed, along with other myths, by the Fishmongers' Company, the story continues that in gratitude for his rescue he offered a rowing wager to the fastest of six young watermen in their first year of freedom, over the course between \\"The Swan\\" pub at London Bridge and \\"The Swan\\" pub at Chelsea. Rowing wagers were common in those days, but this one was unique: Doggett set the wager to be a traditional red watermens' coat, but, being a \\"great Whig in Politics\\", Doggett arranged the race for 1 August each year, and had the coat furnished with a silver badge \\"representing Liberty\\", to commemorate the accession to the throne on 1 August 1714 of George I of the House of Hanover. The current badge prominently features both the word \\"Liberty\\" and an image of the horse, an emblem of the House of Hanover. The race was organised and financed by Doggett each year from 1715 until his death in 1721. In his will, Doggett left specific instructions for the continuation of the race, which is now held by the Fishmongers' Company, a livery company of the City of London. However, over the ages, several particulars have changed: * Originally, the race was run against the tide, but since 1873 it has been run with the incoming tide. * It was intended to be held each \\"1st day of August forever\\", but now often occurs in September, with the precise date and time depending on the tides. * The intention was that competitors should race in the boats of their passenger-ferrying trade. At first these boats were four-seater passenger wherries (which could take nearly two hours to row the distance), later \\"old fashion boats\\", then \\"best\\" boats, then clinker gigs, then modified best boats. Since 1769 the Fishmongers' Company has set regulations; these state that all vessels must be \\"common Scullers Boats\\" and examined by the Company. Contemporary single sculls are now used and take about 30 minutes to race the course. * Lots were originally drawn at Watermen's Hall but are now drawn at Fishmongers' Hall due to unfair practices. * As the population of watermen has declined, since 1988 the event has been open to unsuccessful competitors to row again in their second and third years of freedom.

It is called one of the most beautiful rivers in the United States. The Alatna River stems from the central Brooks Range flowing through the Endicott Mountains, passing Circle Lake, the Arrigetch Peaks and Takahula Lake before entering the Helpmejack Hills. The last section of the river continues to flow in a SSE direction through the Alatna Hills into its confluence with the Koyukuk River near the small village of Allakaket. The first of the Alatna are shallow and rocky, followed by of a continued shallow area with more rapids. The river then mellows out near Takahula and Circle Lake becoming deeper and more meandering while the scenery turns from mountain peaks into hilly boreal forest. According to The Alaska River Guide, this river is long from the headwaters to Allakaket and from Circle Lake to Allakaket. The river is very popular for float trips due to its calm flow and wonderful scenery. Float trips usually take from four to fourteen days, depending on put-in spot and pick-up spot, and also weather/river conditions. One common place to put in is Circle Lake, a small lake which is float plane accessible and is located in a beautiful part of the valley. Another place to put in is Takahula Lake, a larger, float-plane accessible lake, further downstream from Circle Lake. Gaedeke Lake is also a possible put in spot, but according to the Alaska River Guide, this upstream section near the headwaters of the river is shallow and rocky making portaging or lining necessary. Most floaters take out at the village of Allakaket. Bob Marshall made an exploratory mapping trip up the river in 1931, following the river drainage from Allakaket upstream, to the Kutuk River, and onwards to the Brooks Range. He was following in the footsteps of Philip Smith in 1911, the Murie brothers Olas and Adolph in 1923, and the Smith, Fitzgerald, and Mertie USGS trip of 1924.

Yakutat area fishing Both rivers produce king, silver, and sockeye commercially. Chum and pink salmon can also be caught, but are not generally sought after due to their relative lack of worth/quality. These two rivers can be characterized as low volume fisheries, while the Alsek river in particular produces particularly high quality salmon due to its low temperature. The Alsek's silt content also prevents the sun from damaging the fish. The area also supports subsistence and sport fishing.

In 1980, the Andreafsky and the East Fork Andreafsky rivers became part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The designation covers about 265 river miles (RM) or 426 river kilometers (RK) along the two streams and their headwaters. About 198 RM (319 RK) of these flow through the Yukon Delta Wilderness; 54 RM (87 RK) cross private lands, and 13 RM (21 RK) flow through a wild-river corridor within non-wilderness refuge lands. Flora and fauna Black spruce and white spruce, balsam poplar, and large bogs dominate the land near the rivers, while willow shrubs, mosses, lichens, and other vegetation grows on the tundra at higher elevations in the watershed. Wildlife includes foxes, beavers, bald eagles, golden eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, geese, and large populations of brown bears. Bristle-thighed curlews have one of their main nesting grounds in the upstream (Nulato Hills) portion of the wilderness. Grayling, salmon, and Dolly Varden trout are found in both rivers.

The river empties into the Kuskokwim River slightly east of Aniak. Aniak is a Yup'ik word meaning \\"the place where it comes out,\\" which refers to the mouth of the Aniak River. This river played a role in the Placer Gold Rush of 1900‚Äì01, when prospectors from Nome rushed to the Kuskokwim River Delta after hearing of discoveries along the \\"Yellow River\\", later believed to be the Aniak River because of the yellow tint from silt carried from headwater streams. The Aniak has excellent sports fishing opportunities for salmon, Arctic char, rainbow trout, Arctic grayling, and, near the river mouth in spring, northern pike and sheefish. In addition, Aniak Lake supports populations of lake trout. Several sports fishing outfitters operate along the Aniak. Navigation of the river is tricky, since it is swift flowing with multiple channels and many hazards, including debris loads, log jams and sweepers (trees hanging just above the water which \\"sweep\\" the surface as it flows by) that change position with each spring's ice breakup cycle. The lower river is more navigable with an experienced boat driver. The upper river, however, is typically only accessed by rafts which can be dropped off by airplane at Aniak Lake, upstream from the Kuskokwim confluence. The Aniak River itself, approximately from the mouth, is unusable for surface travel in winter due to incomplete freeze and speed of flow. Historical winter trails parallel most of its length.

Construction A seagoing dugout canoe The canoes are made by carving solid logs, usually of red cedar but in some areas of Sitka spruce or cottonwood. The boats were typically widened beyond the original diameter of the log by spreading the sides after a steam-softening process. Spreading does more than widen the canoe; it also introduces major changes of form throughout the hull which the canoemaker must anticipate when carving the log. The straight and level gunwales bend smoothly out and down, while the ends rise, forming a graceful sheer and transforming a rigidly narrow, hollow trough into an elegant watercraft. In order to spread without splitting, the walls of the hull are made remarkably thin. When the hull is completely carved, water is poured into it to a depth of six inches or so, and heated to boiling with red-hot rocks. The resulting steam is confined by covering the open hull with mats. The hot rocks are replaced as needed to keep the water at a boil. The softened sides, heated through by the steam inside and fires outside, begin to move outward, aided by the weight of water and rocks pressing down in the centre. Spreading sticks are tapped into place between the gunwales, and are moved towards the ends and increased in length in the centre as the sides flare outward. When the planned beam and form are reached, the canoe is allowed to cool, the water is removed, and the thwarts, bow and stern blocks, and gunwale caps are fitted and fastened in place. Large travelling and war canoes were often painted with designs associated with the names of the canoes or the crests of the owners. Uses The canoes were used for transport up and down the coast. They were used for trading, as war canoes, in competitions, and for fishing. Emily Carr, who grew up in the early days of Victoria, British Columbia, describes a regatta in which the Indian races were the highlight. The canoes, of ten paddlers and a steersman acting as coxswain, \\"flash[ed] through their races like running fire.\\" The Kloochman (\\"wife\\" in Chinook Jargon) was \\"an even grander race\\" than the men's, with the women giving \\"every scrap of themselves to the canoe\\", working in complete unityThe Book of Small, Emily Carr, 1942.

Modern examples In 1937 Betty Lowman Carey became the first woman to row single-handed the Inside Passage of British Columbia in a dugout canoe. In 1978 Geordie Tocher and two companions sailed a 3¬Ω ton, 40 foot (12 metre) dugout canoe (the \\"Orenda II\\"), made of Douglas Fir, and based on Haida designs (but with sails), from Vancouver, Canada to Hawaii to add credibility to stories that the Haida had travelled to Hawaii in ancient times.

The creek begins at the confluence of Champion and Bear creeks in the White Mountains National Recreation Area, about north of Fairbanks. From there it flows west around the southern end of the White Mountains, then northeast into the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, then west into the Yukon River downstream of Beaver. In 1980, The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act designated the upper of Beaver Creek as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Most of this lies within the recreation area, but the last are in the wildlife refuge.  Description  Beaver Creek flows from its headwaters through thick forest of white spruce and paper birch forests and tundra on the high slopes of the White Mountains, where limestone peaks reach on the creek's north and east side. The creek has plentiful gravel bars, and willows grow on its banks. The lower portion of the creek follows a very convoluted course through Yukon Flats, an area that contains thousands of lakes. Geographical features of these lowlands include sloughs and oxbow lakes. Beaver Creek is part of an active alluvial stream system in one of the most productive waterfowl breeding areas in North America and the most productive in Alaska. Recreation The most common way to visit lower Beaver Creek is to float down from upstream, although it is possible to land small aircraft on the stream's gravel bars. The upper creek can be reached via Nome Creek, which flows into Beaver Creek a few miles from its origin. Nome Creek is accessible by highway. The lower reaches of Beaver Creek can also be accessed by boating upstream from the Yukon River, if the water level is medium to high. The entire creek is rated Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty and can be floated in a variety of watercraft. The Nome Creek approach involves difficult paddling in a winding, narrow channel with shallows and overhanging vegetation. However, Beaver Creek itself is wide and deep from the confluence with Nome Creek to the confluence with Victoria Creek, more than further downstream. Below that, in the wildlife refuge, the river becomes even wider and deeper, with broad gravel bars. Overhanging or partly submerged trees, stumps, and logs pose a hazard to boaters. Sports fishing for northern pike and Arctic grayling along Beaver Creek can be \\"outstanding\\", according to Alaska Fishing.

Beginning at the confluence of its north and south forks in the Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, the Fortymile flows generally northeast into Canada to meet the larger river southeast of Eagle, Alaska. History Prospectors named the river after gold was discovered there in 1886. The name reflected the distance of the river mouth from Fort Reliance, a former Hudson's Bay Company post upstream along the Yukon River. Miners eventually extracted more than a half-million ounces of gold from the Fortymile watershed. After the gold discovery, two Alaska Commercial Company traders, Jack McQuesten and Arthur Harper, built a post at the mouth of the river. Between 1968 and 1978, Cassiar Mining extracted about a million metric tons of asbestos from three open pits along Clinton Creek, a tributary of lower Fortymile River in the Yukon. After abandoning the site, the company went bankrupt in 1992, and the territorial and Canadian governments and others removed or buried mine wastes, stabilized the creek banks, and worked to partly restore the land. Wild and scenic designation In 1980, a total of of stream segments within the Alaska portion of the Fortymile River watershed were added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System of the United States. This included designated \\"wild\\", called \\"scenic\\", and designated \\"recreational\\". The Bureau of Land Management oversees the Fortymile Wild and Scenic River, accessible via the Taylor Highway in Alaska as well as an unpaved road branching from the Top of the World Highway in the Yukon Territory. Float trips, camping, and sightseeing are among the recreational possibilities in the watershed. Boating The Fortymile River main stem as well as the North Fork, South Fork, and other tributaries offer a variety of boating possibilities for experienced paddlers of rafts and kayaks, or experienced canoeists willing to portage around difficult rapids. The many runnable segments vary from Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty to Class V (extremely difficult). In addition to rapids, dangers include overhanging or submerged vegetation and the high probability of confusing one bend in a stream with another--thus entering rapids disoriented and unprepared--without the aid of a map and compass. One of the watershed's hydrologic features, the Kink, is an artificial channel that is part of a Class V rapids on the North Fork. Mining interests blasted the channel through a ridge in 1904 in order to expose of the original riverbed for prospecting on dry land. The Kink is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a significant engineering feat of the early 20th century.

In an era when siege warfare dominated military campaigns, he and his French counterpart Vauban were the acknowledged experts in designing, taking and defending fortifications. Both had their advocates; Vauban's maxim of 'more powder, less blood' also took longer, an important consideration when most military deaths occurred from disease. He is also viewed as more innovative in the design and extent of his fortifications, which included ports, waterways, roads and even town layouts. However, unlike Vauban, Van Coehoorn had limited financial resources. He showed great skill in maximising these, while adapting to the specific challenges posed by the flat terrain in the Netherlands. Some of his water defences and designs were still being used in the 1950s. Life The United Provinces; Friesland at top Van Coehoorn was born at Britsum in March 1641, one of six sons of Goosewijn van Coehoorn and Aaltje van Hinckena, owners of the Lettinga State, near Leeuwarden, in the Dutch province of Friesland. Goosewijn was an officer in a Friesland regiment of the Dutch States Army and a member of the petty nobility. The family originally came from Kuhhornshof, near Frankfurt; in 1572, his great- grandfather joined the army of William the Silent, leader of the Dutch Revolt. Van Coehoorn was educated at home with his brothers, and showed an aptitude for mathematics and military drawing. He later attended the University of Franeker, where he was supervised by his uncle Bernardus Fullenius (1602-1657), professor of mathematics and trainer of surveyors. He had four surviving children from his first marriage to Magdalena van Scheltinga in 1678: Goosewijn (1678-1737), Gertruda (1679-1757), Hendrik (1683-1756) and Amalia (1683-1708). After her death in 1683, he married Truytje van Wigara (dates unknown); he died on 17 March 1704 and was buried at Wijckel. Early career In 1657, he was commissioned Lieutenant in his father's company, part of the permanent garrison in Maastricht. Promoted captain in October 1660, Van Coehoorn first saw action in 1665 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, when he helped repulse an English-funded invasion by the Bishop of Munster. During the 1672 to 1678 Franco-Dutch War, he was wounded at the defence of Maastricht in 1673, then fought at Grave and Seneffe in 1674. Promoted major just before Cassel in 1677, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel when the war ended. In the Netherlands, 1672 is still known as the Rampjaar or Year of Disaster. The rapid fall of major fortresses like Nijmegen and Fort Cr√®vec≈ìur near 's-Hertogenbosch demonstrated the Republic's vulnerability, and the obsolescence of its defences. This caused intense debate in two areas; first, where to locate strongpoints; second, how to design fortifications suitable to the flat terrain of the Netherlands. Design principles Sluice gate near Utrecht; Van Coehoorn incorporated water defences in his designs Van Coehoorn set out his ideas in a public debate over the design of a new fortress at Coevorden with Captain Louis Paen, an officer in the same regiment, who had produced a well-received critique of the Dutch drill manual in 1679. In 1682, Van Coehoorn published Versterckinge des Vijfhoeks met al syne buytenwerken or Fortification of the Pentagon and all its outer works; this was followed in 1685 by what remains his best-known work, Nieuwe Vestingbouw op een natte of lage horisont or New Fortress Construction on a Wet or Low Horizon. Few states could afford a large standing army, so permanent fortifications were intended to slow down an opponent, providing time to mobilise reserves. In 1672, the Dutch were nearly over-run due to the speed with which the French captured fortresses like Nijmegen, and saved only by activating the Hollandic Water Line. Van Coehoorn accepted the flat terrain of the Netherlands and huge cost of construction meant an effective defence could not rely solely on fortifications. His designs included these key principles; Active defence; defenders should constantly disrupt the besiegers, rather than simply sitting behind their walls. This meant providing open areas within the fortifications to assemble a counter-attacking force. Multiple defence lines; the existing practice of all round defence meant a breach in one area often led to the rapid surrender of the whole position. Instead, Van Coehoorn created multiple 'Inner' and 'Outer' defence zones that funnelled attackers through successive 'killing zones' of flanking fire; Variously delivered from loopholed redoubts in the re-entrant places-of-arms, from earthen faussebrayes, and long, concave double-bastioned flanks. These works were screened from view by their low profiles, and, in the case of the flanks, by narrow, tower-like orillons of solid masonry\\"; Denial of terrain; \\"... he protected his works by digging alternate ranks of wet and dry ditches. The dry ditches and covertways were cut down to within a few inches of the water table ... (if the besiegers) cut into the floor in the normal way, they would soon be flooded out;\\" Van Coehoorn argued the high water table common in the Netherlands negated the danger posed by mining, and thus he required only two-thirds of the materials needed for similar French fortifications. Water was another feature of his work; although completed years after his death, he designed the Zuider Waterlinie between Sluis and Nijmegen. His recommendation of a defensive barrier in the east, using the IJssel and the Dutch portion of the Lower Rhine, formed the basis of a NATO defence line built in the 1950s, codenamed Plans 'C' for Coehoorn and 'D' for Deventer.  Namur; the Sieges of 1692 and 1695  His ideas remained untested until the 1688-1697 Nine Years War, whose tactics placed great emphasis on manoeuvre and siege warfare. He was present at the capture of Kaiserswerth and Bonn in 1690; his role is unclear but Frederick I offered him a position as Major-General in the Prussian army, which he refused. Van Coehoorn was finally able to implement his ideas when appointed commander of Namur in 1691. Namur was divided between the 'City', on the flat northern bank of the River Sambre, with the 'Citadel' on high ground to the south controlling access to the Sambre and Meuse rivers. He strengthened the 'inner' Citadel with new outworks at Fort William and La Casotte, but did not have time to do the same for the 'outer' City area. The garrison of 5,000 was too small for an active defence, while many were poorly trained and motivated Spanish troops. In the 1692 Siege of Namur, the City fell in less than five days, but the Citadel and its 500 Dutch defenders held out until 30 June. This was largely due to the terms negotiated when Van Coehoorn surrendered the City; he agreed not to fire on the City from the Citadel, in return for the French not attacking from that direction. As Vauban pointed out, this made it almost impregnable. Regardless, the defence was a significant achievement and William III made him Major-General and commander of the vital city of Li√®ge. He also supervised the construction of new defences at Huy, which the Dutch lost in July 1693, then recaptured in September 1694. His French counterpart and rival, Vauban (1633-1707) The focus of the 1695 Allied campaign was the second Siege of Namur. The fortifications had been strengthened by Vauban, while Marshall Boufflers had a garrison of 13,000. Van Coehoorn was put in charge of siege operations and quickly captured the outer City; by mid-August, the Citadel remained largely intact and William was growing impatient. A battery of 200 guns was established and on 21 August began a continuous 24 hour bombardment of the Citadel's lower defences; assaults on the resulting breaches were extremely bloody, including 3,000 casualties in three hours on 30 August but the defenders surrendered on 4 September. The two sieges of Namur were the key events of the Nine Years War in Flanders and made Van Coehoorn's reputation. Nieuwe Vestingbouw was translated into English, French and German among others and reprinted on a regular basis, while his ideas were widely used elsewhere, including Mannheim, Belgrade and Temesvar. Ironically, Boufflers' defence of Namur was the best example of Van Coehoorn's defensive principles. He ...demonstrated one could effectively win a campaign by losing a fortress but exhausting the besieging force...(Boufflers) conducted a classic active defence and contested every advance as best he could. An often overlooked innovation used by both Vauban and Van Coehoorn was to focus their entire artillery on specific points, rather than the previous practice of targeting multiple areas. Overwhelming defences with massive firepower became known as the 'Van Coehoorn method'; Vauban preferred a more gradual approach, summarised as 'more powder, less blood.' Both had their supporters; the trade off was time, an important consideration when far more soldiers died from disease than combat.  Later career  Bergen op Zoom after Van Coehoorn's renovations; note diversion of the Scheldt. In recognition of his service, Van Coehoorn was promoted Lieutenant General and appointed Ingenieur Generaal der Fortificati√´n and General of Artillery. His brother Gideon replaced him as Colonel of the Nassau Friesland Regiment, while Van Coehoorn himself transferred to a Holland regiment; this increased his influence, since he now reported to William, rather than the Frisian Stadholder Hendrik Casimir. The 1697 Treaty of Ryswick allowed the Dutch to garrison towns in the Spanish Netherlands, including Nieuwpoort, Charleroi, Luxembourg, Mons and Namur. This created a buffer zone, or defence-in-depth, later formalised in the 1715 Barrier Treaty. Van Coehoorn was given responsibility for the Dutch Republic's fortifications; one of his strengths was adapting to fit individual sites and minimising costs, essential skills as the Dutch had insufficient funds for all the repairs and additions needed. Nijmegen and Bergen op Zoom were prioritised for upgrades, although both were incomplete when the War of the Spanish Succession broke out. Van Coehoorn was appointed Governor of Sluis and military commander in Zeelandic Flanders. The armies of the Nine Years War often exceeded 100,000 men, too large for the pre-industrial societies that supported them; Marlborough, Allied commander in the Low Countries, argued one battle was more beneficial than taking 12 fortresses. Van Coehoorn's burial place in Wijckel Although Van Coehoorn agreed, the Dutch survived a century of almost constant warfare by keeping their army together; losing a battle might lose them the war, and they considered Marlborough's approach unnecessarily risky. Instead, they spent 1702 and 1703 taking towns such as Venlo and Roermond in the modern Dutch province of Limburg, as well as Li√®ge, Bonn and Huy. Strategy was affected by conflicting objectives, between England and the Republic and also the States General. The States of Holland opposed the 1703 offensive against Ostend and Antwerp, since it potentially threatened Amsterdam's monopoly over the Scheldt river trade. In the confusion, a Dutch army was surrounded by a French force several times their size at Ekeren on 30 June, and only just escaped. Rightly or wrongly, Van Coehoorn was blamed for this; he was a difficult character and William's death deprived him of his most powerful sponsor. The campaigns of 1702 and 1703 exposed his limitations as a field officer and led to criticism from Marlborough and his Dutch colleagues. He was considering an offer to serve with the army of Savoy when he died on 17 March 1704 in The Hague, attending a conference with Marlborough. The States of Friesland paid for a monument over his grave at Wijckel. Other In May 1701, Van Coehoorn demonstrated a light-weight mortar to William, later known as the Coehorn (sic). Designed to provide cover for infantry assaults, it was first used at Kaiserworth in 1702 and variations remained in service during the US Civil War in 1861. He also led a number of significant civil projects, including re- dyking the Lower Scheldt, and designing new barrages along the Zuiderzee. The Menno van Coehoorn Foundation was established in 1932 to preserve the cultural heritage of historical fortifications in the Netherlands and their associated wildlife.

The Ka-226 features an interchangeable mission pod, rather than a conventional cabin, allowing the use of various accommodation or equipment configurations. The Ka-226 entered service in 2002.  Development  A twin-turbine version of the successful reciprocating- engined Kamov Ka-26, (the Kamov Ka-126 is the single-turbine version) the Ka-226 was initially announced in 1990. Originally developed to meet the requirements of the Russian disaster relief ministry, the aircraft first flew on 4 September 1997. Certification to Russian AP-29 \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" transport categories was granted on 31 October 2003. The Ka-226 entered production at \\"Motor Sich\\", Zaporozhye, Ukraine. In December 2014 it was reported that India is in agreement with the Russian Federation to produce Ka-226T and Mi-17 on its territory. Under a 2011 contract with Russian Ministry of Defence, Kumertau Aviation Production Enterprise completed production of a batch of Ka-226.80 helicopters, which was delivered to the customer on 17 April 2015. \\"The planned scope of the assignment of state contract signed with the Ministry of Defence in 2011 fully implemented with ahead of schedule deliveries. Prematurely delivered a large consignment of helicopters. Previously, under the state contract with the Russian Defence Ministry were also delivered several Ka-226.80 batches\\", - said the Managing Director of Kumertau Aviation Production Enterprise (KumAPP) Viktor Novikov. In April 2015 Certification of Ka-226T light multi-role helicopter powered by Turbomeca Arrius 2G engines from France has been successfully completed in Russia. Two Ka-226T helicopters took part in the flight test programme. The version of Ka-226T powered by Turbomeca Arrius 2G engines offers much better performance compared to production Ka-226s powered by Allison 250-C20R/2 engines. It was reported earlier that deliveries of Ka-226 helicopters manufactured by Kumertau Aviation Production Enterprise (Ka-226.50 and Ka-226.80 versions) and powered by Allison 250-C20R/2 engines were started in 2005. The helicopters were delivered to the Federal Security Service of Russian Federation (at least six vehicles), Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (11 vehicles), Russian air forces (a total of 36 helicopters should be delivered) and Ukrainian Ministry of Emergency Situations (1 helicopter). Next year the enterprise was to start implementation of a contract for delivery of 18 Ka-226TG helicopters to Gazpromavia. In late March 2017 Russian security structures received first 2 ship-based Ka-226Ts and the delivery of six helicopters was completed in April 2018. In March 2018 Russia issued a supplement to the certificate for Ka-226T helicopter that allows the machine to operate at high temperatures. Following selection of the Ka-226T to meet an India requirement for 197 helicopters, an agreement was signed in December 2015 for the creation of a joint venture between Rostec, Russian Helicopters and Hindustan Aeronautics to build the helicopters at a new factory to be built at Tumakuru in India.  Design  The design is a refinement of the proven Ka-26, featuring interchangeable mission pods. The aircraft is fitted with a new rotor system, increased visibility nose, and new passenger cabin design. The Ka-226 also features a new transmission system and is made largely from composite materials. The aircraft is fitted with trademark Kamov coaxial rotors, of advanced composite design, making the Ka-226 highly manoeuvrable and eliminating the need for a tail rotor.  Variants  A Russian Air Force Ka-226 Search and rescue, medivac, disaster relief and patrol variants have been developed for the Russian Emergency Ministry. Air ambulance, police and fire fighting variants have been developed for the Russian government. ;Ka-226: Utility helicopter. ;Ka-226AG: Gazprom specific variant. ;Ka-226T: Instead of Rolls-Royce 250C engines, this variant is fitted with the more powerful Turbomeca Arrius 2G1. Each engine provides 670 shp, increasing the service ceiling to around 7,000 m, providing improved high altitude and high temperature operation. Helicopter has new avionics with multifunctional displays, automatic control system, navigation system, radar. It can be equipped with hoist system, helicopter sling, searchlight, additional external fuel tank.

He confirmed explorer John Rae's controversial report gathered from Inuit sources on the fate of Franklin's lost expedition, the ill-fated Royal Navy undertaking commanded by Sir John Franklin in 1845 to be the first to traverse the Northwest Passage. McClintock's report was received more favorably than that of Rae, who was shunned and denied recognition for having discovered the lost expedition's fate. Rae's report ultimately guided McClintock to the correct area to conduct a search. McClintock also stirred controversy with his claim that Franklin, before his death, had essentially discovered the Northwest Passage, while in reality he had not. Rae, with his discovery of Rae Strait, had discovered the real ice-free passage through North America's Arctic archipelago.  Early life  Francis Leopold McClintock was born on 8 July 1819, one of 14 children of Henry McClintock, a collector of customs at Dundalk in County Louth, Ireland, and his wife Elizabeth Melesina . He was the second oldest son, although the eldest died as an infant. The family was well connected; McClintock's uncle, John McClintock, was a member of parliament for County Louth and owned Drumcar House. Arctic exploration In 1835, McClintock became a member of the Royal Navy as a gentleman volunteer, and joined a series of searches for Sir John Franklin between 1848 and 1859. He mastered travel through the manhauling of sledges, which remained the status quo when it cames to overland travel in the Royal Navy‚Äîuntil the death of Robert Falcon Scott in his bid to reach the South Pole in 1912. In 1848, McClintock accompanied James Clark Ross on his survey of Somerset Island. As part of Captain Henry Kellett's expedition from 1852 to 1854, McClintock travelled by sled and discovered of previously unknown coastline.  Fate of Franklin's expedition  on a rock near Island In 1854, explorer John Rae travelled west from Repulse Bay and learned from the Inuit that a ship had been abandoned somewhere to the west. Previous expeditions had not searched the area because they thought it was ice-blocked. In April 1857, at Lady Jane Franklin's request, McClintock agreed to take command of the and led a 25-man crew in a new search for Franklin's lost expedition in the area west of Repulse Bay. At Disko Bay, he hired 30 sled dogs and an Inuit driver. It was a bad year for ice, and from September the Fox was beset in the ice for eight months. The following year was another disappointement, and he did not reach Beechey Island until August 1858\\\\. He entered Peel Sound, found it blocked by ice, backed up, and entered Prince Regent Inlet in the hope of passing Bellot Strait. He was glad to extricate himself from this narrow passage and found winter quarters near its entrance. In February 1859, when sledging became practical, he went south to the North Magnetic Pole‚Äîwhich had been found by James Clark Ross in 1831. Here he met some Inuit who told him that a ship had been crushed by ice off King William Island, the crew had landed safely and that some white people had starved to death on an island. In April, he went south again and on the east coast of King William Island met other Inuit who sold him artefacts from Franklin's expedition. William Hobson, who had separated from him, found the only written record left by Franklin's expedition buried under a cairn on the northwest corner of the island. The document recorded Sir John Franklin's death on 11 June 1847, and also intimated Francis Crozier and James Fitzjames' plan to lead the survivors south toward the North American mainland. They also found a skeleton with European clothes and a ship's boat on runners containing two corpses. They got as far south as Montreal Island and the mouth of the Back's Great Fish River. Discovery of the remains of the cairn McClintock returned to England in September 1859, and was hailed as the discoverer of the lost expedition's fate. In addition to being knighted, the officers and men of the Fox shared a ¬£5,000 parliamentary reward. The tale was published in The Voyage of the 'Fox' in the Arctic seas: a narrative of the discovery of the fate of Sir John Franklin and his companions. McClintock's findings were of special importance for the subsequent romantification of John Franklin's figure in British culture, since the establishment of his date of death as having occurred before the ships' abandonment, and the crew's failed trek south firmly acquitted the veteran sailor from any suspicion of cannibalism. This had been a concern since 1854, when Rae had arrived back to London with shocking reports from Inuit sources that had greatly scandalized Victorian society, particularly Lady Franklin. McClintock's writings, on the other hand, were obsequious towards Franklin, even going so far as to celebrate his \\"virtual completion\\" of the Northwest Passage, even though and never sailed through Rae Strait, the only truly navigable passageway‚Äîfor a 19th-century ship‚Äîthat would have allowed sailing along North America's northern Arctic coastline all the way into the Pacific. From 1865 to 1868, he was appointed Commodore Jamaica Division and in superintended Jamaica Dockyard. Later life From 1872 to 1877, McClintock was admiral-superintendent of Portsmouth Dockyard. In 1879, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the North America and West Indies Station aboard the flagship .William Loney RN McClintock retired from the Royal Navy in 1884 as a rear admiral. He died on 17 November 1907 and was buried at Kensington Cemetery.Library and Archive catalogue Royal Society His son, Robert S. McClintock, married Mary, the youngest daughter of Major General Sir Howard Craufurd Elphinstone.

A-GPS is extensively used with GPS-capable cellular phones, as its development was accelerated by the U.S. FCC's 911 requirement to make cell phone location data available to emergency call dispatchers. Description Standalone/self-ruling GPS devices depend solely on information from satellites. A-GPS augments that by using cell tower data to enhance quality and precision when in poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, for example in urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit multipath propagation where signals skip off structures, or are weakened by meteorological conditions or tree canopy. Some standalone GPS navigators used in poor conditions can't fix a position because of satellite signal fracture and must wait for better satellite reception. A regular GPS unit may need as long as 12.5 minutes (the time needed to download the GPS almanac and ephemerides) to resolve the problem and be able to provide a correct location. An assisted GPS system can address these problems by using external data. Utilizing this system can come at a cost to the user. For billing purposes, network providers often count this as a data access, which can cost money, depending on the tariff. To be precise, A-GPS features depend mostly on an Internet network or connection to an ISP (or CNP, in the case of CP/mobile-phone device linked to a cellular network provider data service). A mobile (cell phone, smart phone) device with just an L1 front-end radio receiver and no GPS acquisition, tracking, and positioning engine only works when it has an internet connection to an ISP/CNP, where the position fix is calculated offboard the device itself. It doesn't work in areas with no coverage or internet link (or nearby base transceiver station (BTS) towers, in the case on CNP service coverage area). Without any of those resources, it can't connect to the A-GPS servers usually provided by CNPs. On the other hand, a mobile device with a GPS chipset requires no data connection to capture and process GPS data into a position solution, since it receives data directly from the GPS satellites and is able to calculate a position fix itself. However, the availability of a data connection can provide assistance to improve the performance of the GPS chip on the mobile device. Assistance falls into two categories: # Mobile Station Based (MSB): Information used to acquire satellites more quickly. #* It can supply orbital data or almanac for the GPS satellites to the GPS receiver, enabling the GPS receiver to lock to the satellites more rapidly in some cases. #* The network can provide precise time. # Mobile Station Assisted (MSA): Calculation of position by the server using information from the GPS receiver. #* The device captures a snapshot of the GPS signal, with approximate time, for the server to later process into a position. #* The assistance server has a good satellite signal and plentiful computation power, so it can compare fragmentary signals relayed to it. #* Accurate, surveyed coordinates for the cell site towers allow better knowledge of local ionospheric conditions and other conditions affecting the GPS signal than the GPS receiver alone, enabling more precise calculation of position. As an additional benefit, in mobile station assisted implementations, the amount of processing and software required for a GPS receiver can be reduced by offloading most of the work onto the assistance server. A typical A-GPS- enabled receiver uses a data connection (Internet or other) to contact the assistance server for aGPS information. If it also has functioning autonomous GPS, it may use standalone GPS, which is sometimes slower on time to first fix, but does not depend on the network, and therefore can work beyond network range and without incurring data-usage fees. Some A-GPS devices do not have the option of falling back to standalone or autonomous GPS. Many mobile phones combine A-GPS and other location services, including Wi-Fi positioning system and cell-site multilateration and sometimes a hybrid positioning system. High- Sensitivity GPS is an allied technology that addresses some of these issues in a way that does not require additional infrastructure. However, unlike some forms of A-GPS, high-sensitivity GPS cannot provide a fix instantaneously when the GPS receiver has been off for some time. Basic concepts Standalone GPS provides first position in approximately 30‚Äì40 seconds. A standalone GPS needs orbital information of the satellites to calculate the current position. The data rate of the satellite signal is only 50 bit/s, so downloading orbital information like ephemerides and the almanac directly from satellites typically takes a long time, and if the satellite signals are lost during the acquisition of this information, it is discarded and the standalone system has to start from scratch. In A-GPS, the network operator deploys an A-GPS server, a cache server for GPS data. These A-GPS servers download the orbital information from the satellite and store it in the database. An A-GPS-capable device can connect to these servers and download this information using mobile-network radio bearers such as GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE or even using other radio bearers such as Wi-Fi or LoRa. Usually the data rate of these bearers is high, hence downloading orbital information takes less time. Modes of operation A-GPS has two modes of operation: ;Mobile Station Assisted (MSA): In MSA mode A-GPS operation, the A-GPS capable device receives acquisition assistance, reference time and other optional assistance data from a mobile service provider. The mobile service provider continuously logs GPS information (mainly the almanac) from the GPS satellites using an A-GPS server in its system. With the help of the above data (the data received from the mobile device and the data already present in an A-GPS server) the A-GPS server calculates the position and sends it back to the A-GPS device. ;Mobile Station Based (MSB): In MSB mode A-GPS operation, the A-GPS device receives ephemeris, reference location, reference time and other optional assistance data from the A-GPS server. With the help of the above data, the A-GPS device receives signals from the visible satellites and calculates the position. Standards A-GPS protocols are part of Positioning Protocol defined by two different standardization bodies, 3GPP and Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). ;Control Plane Protocol: Defined by the 3GPP for various generations of mobile phone systems. These protocols are defined for circuit switched networks. The following positioning protocols have been defined. * RRLP ‚Äì 3GPP defined RRLP (Radio Resource Location Protocol) to support positioning protocol on GSM networks. * TIA 801 ‚Äì CDMA2000 family defined this protocol for CDMA 2000 networks. * RRC position protocol ‚Äì 3GPP defined this protocol as part of the RRC standard for UMTS network. * LPP ‚Äì 3GPP defined LPP or LTE positioning protocol for LTE networks. ;User Plane Protocol: Defined by the OMA to support positioning protocols in packet switched networks.

History=Early years Loading airmail, late 1930s, Detroit The first cargo flight took place on the 7 November 1910 in the USA, between Dayton and Columbus, Ohio. Philip Orin Parmelee piloted a Wright Model B aeroplane 65 miles (105 km) carrying a package of 200 pounds of silk for the opening of a store. Newspaper clippings quoted the Wright brothers as stating he covered the distance in 66 minutes, but the flight was officially recorded at 57 minutes, a world speed record at the time. It was the first ‚Äúcargo only‚Äù flight solely for the transport of goods; the first flight commissioned by a client, and the first example of multimodal air transport, since the pieces of silk were transported by car from Columbus aerodrome to the store. The world's first official airmail flight by airplane took place on 18 February 1911, at a large exhibition in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, British India. The organizer of the aviation display, Sir Walter Windham, was able to secure permission from the postmaster general in India to operate an airmail service in order to generate publicity for the exhibition and to raise money for charity. This first airmail flight was piloted by Henri Pequet, who flew 6,500 letters a distance of 13 km (8.1 mi), from Allahabad to Naini‚Äîthe nearest station on the Bombay- Calcutta line to the exhibition. The aircraft used was a Humber-Sommer biplane with about fifty horsepower (37 kW), and it made the journey in thirteen minutes. The world's first scheduled airmail post service took place in the United Kingdom between the London suburb of Hendon, and the Postmaster General's office in Windsor, Berkshire, on September 9, 1911. It was part of the celebrations for King George V's coronation and at the suggestion of Sir Walter Windham, who based his proposal on the successful experiment he had overseen in India. The service ran for just under a month, transporting 35 bags of mail in 16 flights. In the early 20s, air cargo developed rapidly because numerous entrepreneurs realized aircraft could move high value and low volume consignments much faster than the railroads and shipping companies. The first scheduled flight from London to Paris in 1919 had only one passenger but carried leather for a shoe manufacturer and grouse for a restaurant. Cinema films were also a frequent consignment: original news‚Äô bulletins were first carried to a central laboratory to make copies, and then distributed by air throughout Europe for their release in cinemas. Post-war years A Douglas C-54 during the Berlin blockade Although there were a few attempts to organize air freight airlines from the 1920s on, the first commercial airlines that were all-cargo did not emerge until after World War II. In 1945, at a conference in Havana, 57 airlines formed the International Air Transport Association. In 1948 Berlin was jointly controlled by the Western Allies and Russians, although the Russians held the area surrounding the city and thus land access. As this access was closed, in the so-called Berlin blockade, an airlift remained the only option to get increasingly urgent deliveries of food, coal, and other supplies to West Berlin. Over 330 days to 12 May 1949 a total of 2.26 million tons of cargo were airlifted to Berlin, an average of 6,800 tons a day, 80% by the US and 20% by the UK.Morrell, Peter S. (2011): Moving Boxes by Air. The Economics of International Air Cargo Although freight traffic developed modestly, reaching only 800,000 tonnes worldwide by the mid-1950s, the world economy was hitting its post-war stride. Germany and Japan were emerging from their period of purgatory and were poised to take the world of business by storm, the United States was approaching the height of its economic dominance, and Western Europe had recovered from the war. In 1968, Boeing launched the four engine 747, the first wide-body aircraft. The 747 was the first aircraft capable of transporting full pallets in the cargo hold, revolutionizing the air cargo industry. Modern air cargo A FedEx Boeing 777F, an UPS Boeing 747-400F and a DHL tail Despite widespread hopes for a vibrant industry, for decades the air freight sector did not grow as expected and remained a very small part of total air traffic. For much of the first five post-war decades most carriers saw it as a secondary activity, although there had always been specialized cargo airlines. Some passenger airlines have found the practice of carrying \\"belly cargo\\" a highly lucrative enterprise (in fact, it is estimated that 50% of all air freight is moved in this way), to the point where it has lessened the demand for dedicated large cargo aircraft. Cargo emerged as a solid pillar of the industry in the 1990s. The catalysts for the renewed growth in the sector were the express parcel carriers, typified by FedEx, DHL, TNT and UPS, and changes in practices in the manufacturing sector. In 1992, FedEx sent software on computer disks to thousands of customers, allowing them to track shipments from their own workstations. The rise of internet in the years that followed contributed to increase the reliability and accessibility to the air cargo industry. Most airlines now offer to their customers real-time flight status and the booking and tracking options. In addition, the industry is adopting electronic procedures,IATA. Cargo-XML Standards: Modernizing air cargo communication. such as the electronic air waybill, to reduce the amount of paper documentation accompanying each shipment and increasing the security and safety of the transportation. Many retailers are making an effort to integrate the air cargo delivery process with their customer service offering to respond to increasing consumer pressure.\\"eCommerce delivery ‚Äì What do your customers want?\\" SEKO Logistics, 22 August 2018. Accessed: 12 February 2019. An industry expert estimates that 15-20 tonnes of air cargo is worth 30-40 economy passenger seats, when both are on passenger planes.\\"A barrier to A380 sales in the United States\\" RunwayGirl, 3 July 2014. Accessed: 20 July 2014. However, with the exception of the integrators (FedEx, UPS, DHL and TNT) the air cargo industry continues to suffer as the by-product 'poor-relation' of the passenger business. In 2017, the IATA observed a 9% rise in freight tonne kilometers: air cargo demand is strong due to industrial production and global trade growth above expansion of e-commerce, outpacing capacity as available tonne kilometers grew by 3%. Boeing is doubling its 767F production since 2016 to three per month in 2020.

It is part of the theatrical tradition of travesti portrayal of female characters by male actors in drag. Dame characters are often played either in an extremely camp style, or else by men acting butch in women's clothing. They usually wear heavy make up and big hair, have exaggerated physical features, and perform in an over- the-top style. Dame characters Characters who are played as pantomime dames are often, though not exclusively, older, matronly women. They may be the protagonist's mother, as in Jack and the Beanstalk and Robinson Crusoe, or a nursemaid to the protagonist, as in Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Although often warm and sympathetic characters, dames may also be employed as comic antagonists, such as with the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella. Although some pantomimes traditionally do not contain standard dame roles, certain productions of those stories add a dame character, for example, in many versions of Peter Pan. Other examples of dame characters include: *Widow Twankey, Aladdin's mother in the pantomime versions of the story *Mother Goose *The nanny or nurse in Babes in the Woods *The cook in Dick Whittington *The queen in Puss in Boots *Goldilocks' mother in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, who runs a circus in many versions of the pantomime.

Cultural criticism has significant overlap with social and cultural theory. While such criticism is simply part of the self-consciousness of the culture, the social positions of the critics and the medium they use vary widely. The conceptual and political grounding of criticism . Terminology  Contemporary usage has tended to include all types of criticism directed at culture. The term \\"cultural criticism\\" itself has been claimed by Jacques Barzun: No such thing was recognized or in favour when we [i.e. Barzun and Trilling] began--more by intuition than design--in the autumn of 1934.Remembering Lionel Trilling, (1976), reprinted in The Jacques Barzun Reader (2002).Casey Nelson Blake, a professor at Columbia University where Barzun and Trilling were, uses the term in the 1990 book title Beloved Community: The Cultural Criticism of Randolph Bourne, Van Wyck Brooks, Waldo Frank, and Lewis Mumford. It has been argued that in the inter-war period, the language of literary criticism was adequate for the needs of cultural critics; but that later it mainly served academe. Alan Trachtenberg's Critics of Culture (1976) concentrated on American intellectuals of the 1920s who were \\"nonacademic\\" (including H. L. Mencken and Lewis Mumford), where the 1995 collection American Cultural Critics covered mainly later figures, such as F. O. Matthiessen and Susan Sontag, involved in debates on American culture as national. In contrast, a work such as Richard Wolin's 1995 The Terms of Cultural Criticism: The Frankfurt School, Existentialism, Poststructuralism (1995) uses it as a broad-brush description. Victorian sages as critics Cultural critics came to the scene in the nineteenth century. Matthew ArnoldHis much-cited Culture and Anarchy was subtitled An Essay in Political and Social Criticism. and Thomas Carlyle are leading examples of a cultural critic of the Victorian age; in Arnold there is also a concern for religion. John Ruskin was another. Because of an equation made between ugliness of material surroundings and an impoverished life, aesthetes and others might be considered implicitly to be engaging in cultural criticism, but the actual articulation is what makes a critic. In France, Charles Baudelaire was a cultural critic, as was S√∏ren Kierkegaard in Denmark and Friedrich Nietzsche in Germany. Twentieth century In the twentieth century Irving Babbitt on the right, and Walter BenjaminE.g. Richard Wolin, Walter Benjamin: An Aesthetic of Redemption (1994), series Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism, 7. on the left, might be considered major cultural critics. The field of play has changed considerably, in that the humanities have broadened to include cultural studies of all kinds, which are grounded in critical theory. This trend is not without its dissidents, however; James Seaton has written extensively in defense of the continued importance of the Humanistic Tradition Irving Babbitt and his heirs championed, while criticizing the dominance of critical theory in the teaching of literature. Theory's Empire: An Anthology of Dissent features a collection of essays from prominent English professors, writers and critics stating their disagreement with the prominent role given to critical theory in English departments.

Unlike his father Shuja-ud-Daulah was known from an early age for his abilities to synthesize his subordinates, this skill would eventually cause him to emerge as the chosen Grand Vizier by Shah Alam II. Shuja-ud-Daulah was a giant man. Nearly seven feet tall, with oiled moustaches that projected from his face like a pair of outstretched eagle's wings, he was a man of immense physical strength. By 1763, he was past his prime, but still reputedly strong enough to cut off the head of a buffalo with a single swing of his sword, or lift up two of his officers, one in each hand. Shuja-ud- Daulah is also known to have assisted the famous Alivardi Khan on various occasions when the territories of the Nawab of Bengal, were being ravaged by Raghoji I Bhonsle and his Marathas. Thus Shuja-ud-Daulah is known to have been a very respected figure among the servicemen of Alivardi Khan. Nawab of Awadh Procession of Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula at Faizabad. From an album of 18th century Indian watercolours. After the death of his father the Mughal Grand Vizier Safdarjung in the year 1753, Shuja-ud-Daula was recognized as the next Nawab by the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Shuja-ud-Daula despised Imad- ul-Mulk, an ally of the Marathas of the Maratha Empire whose regime emerged after the Battle of Sikandarabad with the support of the Sadashivrao Bhau. Imad-ul-Mulk blinded Ahmad Shah Bahadur and placed Alamgir II on the Mughal imperial throne. Alamgir II and his son Prince Ali Gauhar, were often persecuted by Imad-ul-Mulk because they refused to abandon their peaceful terms with Ahmad Shah Durrani, they also demanded the resignation of Imad-ul- Mulk mainly due to his relations with the Marathas. Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire Prince Ali Gauhar fled from Delhi when he realized a conspiracy that would eventually lead to the murder of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II. Shuj-ud-Daula welcomed and protected Prince Ali Gauhar, who then declared himself Shah Alam II and officially recognized Shuja-ud-Daulah as the Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire. Together they challenged the usurper Shah Jahan III, who was placed on the Mughal imperial throne by Sadashivrao Bhau and his forces, which plundered much of the Mughal Empire. Shah Alam II was then advised to lead an expedition that would attempt to retake the eastern regions of the Mughal Empire from Mir Jafar who was supported by the British East India Company. While Shuja-ud-Daula, Najib-ul-Daula and Mirza Jawan Bakht allied themselves with Ahmad Shah Durrani and assisted his forces during the Second Battle of Sikandarabad in the year 1760 and later led a Mughal Army of 43,000 during the Third Battle of Panipat. Third Battle of Panipat Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula at Lucknow After escaping from Delhi due to the murder of his father the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II, the young Prince Ali Gauhar was well received by Shuja-ud-Daula. The Nawab of Awadh and the newly appointed Mughal Grand Vizier Shuja-ud-Daula assured Prince Ali Gauhar that he and Najib-ud- Daula would initiate a struggle that would overthrow the Maratha if Prince Ali Gauhar would lead what remained of the Mughal Army against the expanding British East India Company in Bengal. Shuja's decision about whom to join as an ally in the Third Battle of Panipat was one of the decisive factors that determined the outcome of the war as lack of food due to the Afghans cutting the supply lines of Marathas was one of the reasons that Marathas could not sustain the day-long battle. Their forces were weak due to starvation and also fighting facing the sun. Shuja was earlier not very sure about whose side should he take before the Third Battle of Panipat. Marathas were still further south then and it would have taken them considerable time to reach Shuja's province. In spite of His mother was of the opinion that he should join the Marathas as they had helped his father previously on numerous occasions he Joined Abdali. As the chosen Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire, Shuja-ud-Daula commanded a sizeable army of Mughal troopers, who cut off the supplies of the Marathas and even defeated them in pitched confrontations during the Third Battle of Panipat and dispatched the Maratha leader Sadashivrao Bhau. Battle of Buxar Shuja is also known for his role in the Battle of Buxar, a battle that was no less definite in Indian history. He along with the forces of Mughal emperor Shah Alam II & Mir Qasim ruler of Bengal were defeated by the British forces in one of the key battles in the history of British East India company.  Allahabad Treaty  Shuja-ud-Daula with his sons and relatives. He again fought British with the help of Marathas at Kara Jahanabad and was defeated. On 16 August 1765 AD he signed the Treaty of Allahabad, which said that Kora and Allahabad district will go to Company and the Company will get 5 million rupees from Awadh.Wikisource: Text of Allahabad Treaty British will be allowed free trade in Awadh and will help each other in case of war with other powers, which was a very shrewd politics of the Company.HISTORY OF AWADH (Oudh) a princely State of India by Hameed Akhtar Siddiqui To pay for the protection of British forces and assistance in war, Awadh gave up first the fort of Chunar, then districts of Benaras, Ghazipur and finally Allahabad.Shuja-ud-daula (1754‚Äì1775) Reemergence of Shah Alam II Shuja-ud-Daula served as the leading Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire during the Third Battle of Panipat, he was also the Nawab of Awadh, and a loyal ally of Shah Alam II throughout his lifetime. After the defeat in the Battle of Buxar Shah Alam II realised that he needed the help of the East India Company to retain his throne with respect rather than becoming a puppet emperor dominated by Maratha's and he did so. Death and burial Gulab Bari, the tomb of Shuja-ud-Daula, in Faizabad. Shuja-ud-Daula died on 26 January 1775 in Faizabad, the then capital of Awadh, and is buried in the same city.

His fate remains unknown, and his case is one of the most famous disappearances in US history. Abduction On July 1, 1874, four-year-old Ross and his five-year-old brother Walter Lewis were playing in the front yard of their family's home in Germantown, a well-to-do section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A horse-drawn carriage pulled up and they were approached by two men who offered the boys candy and fireworks if they would take a ride with them. The boys agreed and they all proceeded through Philadelphia to a store where Walter was directed to buy fireworks inside with 25 cents given to him. Walter did so, but the carriage left without him. Charley Ross was never seen again. Ransom Christian K. Ross, the boys' father, began receiving ransom demands from the apparent kidnappers. They arrived in the form of notes mailed from post offices in Philadelphia and elsewhere, all written in an odd hand and in a coarse, semi-literate style with many simple words misspelled. The communications generally requested a ransom of $20,000 ($400,000 today). The notes cautioned against police intervention and threatened Charley's life if Christian did not cooperate. Christian Ross owned a small dry goods store, and the family lived in a large house. Contrary to what the kidnappers may have thought, the Ross family was not wealthy, and was actually heavily in debt due to the stock market crash of 1873. Seeing no way to pay the ransom, Christian Ross went to the police. The kidnapping soon became national news. In addition to the heavy press coverage, some prominent Philadelphians enlisted the help of the famous Pinkerton detective agency, who had millions of flyers and posters printed with Ross's likeness. A popular song based on the crime was composed by Dexter Smith and W. H. Brockway, entitled \\"Bring Back Our Darling\\". Several attempts were made to provide the kidnappers with ransom money as dictated in the notes, but in each case the kidnappers failed to appear. Eventually, communication stopped. Suspects On the night of December 13, five months after the kidnapping, the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn house belonging to Judge Charles Van Brunt was burgled.\\"Beautiful Shore Road\\", Brooklyn Daily Eagle, August 31, 1890 Holmes Van Brunt, Charles' brother, lived next door, and gathered the members of his household, armed with shotguns, to stop the intruders in the act. As they entered Van Brunt's house, they saw two lanterns go out, and the resulting torrent of gunfire from Holmes and his men brought down both burglars where they stood. They were Bill Mosher and Joe Douglas, career criminals who had recently been released from jail. Mosher was killed instantly while Douglas was mortally wounded, but managed to live about two more hours and was able to communicate with Holmes. Everyone present was shaken by the experience, and there is no clear consensus regarding exactly what Douglas said. Most agree that Douglas said that there was no point in lying (as he knew he was mortally wounded) so he admitted that he and Mosher had abducted Ross. His further statements, if any, are more controversial. He either said that Ross was killed, or that Mosher knew where Ross was, possibly adding that he would be returned unharmed to the Rosses within a few days. In any case, he did not give any clues to Ross's location or other particulars of the crime, and died soon afterwards. Walter Ross was taken to New York City to look at the bodies of Mosher and Douglas so as to determine if they were the men from the carriage ride. Walter confirmed that they were the same men who took the boys from in front of their home the previous summer. Mosher in particular was very identifiable as he had a distinctively malformed nose, which Walter had described to police as a \\"monkey nose\\". (The cartilage of Mosher's nose had been destroyed by syphilis or cancer). For most, the issue of who the men in the carriage were was settled beyond reasonable doubt, but Charley Ross was still missing. Trial A former Philadelphia policeman named William Westervelt, a known associate of William Mosher (and his wife's brother), was arrested and held in connection with the case. He was tried in 1875 for kidnapping. Although Westervelt was a friend and perhaps a confidant of Mosher (while in prison awaiting trial he had told Christian Ross that his son had been alive at the time of Mosher's death), there was virtually no evidence to tie him to the crime itself. Walter Ross, for one, insisted that Westervelt was not one of the men in the carriage that took them away. Westervelt was found not guilty of the kidnapping. However, he was found guilty of a lesser conspiracy charge and served six years in prison. He always maintained his own innocence and swore that he did not know the whereabouts of Charley Ross. Aftermath Two years after the kidnapping, Christian Ross published a book on the case, titled The Father‚Äôs Story of Charley Ross, the Kidnapped Child, in order to raise money to continue searching for his son. By 1878, the media interest in the case had begun to wane. To renew interest, Ross had the book reprinted and began giving lectures in Boston. Christian Ross and his wife continued to search for their son until their deaths (Christian Ross died in 1897 and his wife died in 1912). They followed leads and interviewed over 570 boys, teenagers, and eventually grown men from around the world who claimed to have been Charley Ross. All proved to be imposters. The Rosses eventually spent approximately $60,000 looking for their son. In 1924, newspapers began running stories about the case to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Ross's abduction. By that time, Walter Ross was an adult and was working as a stockbroker. In interviews, he said that he and his three sisters still received letters from middle aged men claiming to be his brother. In 1934, Gustave Blair, a 69-year-old carpenter living in Phoenix, Arizona, petitioned a court to recognize him as the real Charley Ross. Blair claimed that after he was abducted, he lived in a cave and was eventually adopted by a man who told him he was Charley Ross. Walter Ross dismissed Blair's claim calling him \\"a crank\\" and added, \\"The idea that my brother is still alive is not only absurd, but the man's story seems unconvincing. We've long ago given up hope that Charles ever would be found alive.\\" As Blair's claim went uncontested, the court ruled that Blair was \\"Charles Brewster Ross\\" in March 1939. Despite the ruling, the Ross family refused to recognize Blair as their relative and did not bequeath him any money or property from their parents' estate. Blair briefly moved to Los Angeles and attempted to sell his life story to a movie studio but was unsuccessful. He eventually moved to Germantown with his wife before moving back to Phoenix. He died in December 1943 still claiming that he was Charley Ross. The claim of Gustave Blair as being Charley Ross was eventually found to be false as his descendants took a DNA test and it was uncovered that Blair was actually a man named Nelson Miller. * The case, and in particular the fates of Mosher, Douglas, and Westervelt, served as a deterrent to other potential ransom kidnappers: it would be a quarter of a century before another high-profile ransom kidnapping case emerged with Edward Cudahy, Jr. in 1900. The common admonition \\"don't take candy from strangers\\" is said to have come from Charley Ross's abduction. The Charley Project, a major missing persons database, is named for Charley Ross. While waiting for President Franklin D. Roosevelt to appear at the 1936 Democratic National Convention concluding at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, newspaper columnist H.L. Mencken noted a prank had been played on a public address announcer by someone getting him to continually summon a \\"Charles Ross\\" to the press area.The Impossible H. L.

Career in the army Andr√© L√©v√™que was born at Beauvais, France, as the first son of Henri Eug√®ne L√©v√™que and his wife, Blanche Eug√©nie Paintr√©. During World War I (1914 - 1918), he served his country as a soldier, and was decorated with the croix de guerre. Andr√© L√©v√™que joined the armed forces as a simple artillerist, but very soon, became an officer. Several times, he was cited as being very cold-blooded, serving in extremely dangerous situations. Three times (during the battles of the 14th and 15 July, as well as of the 20th of August 1918), he is said to have been exposed to poison gases (citation de l‚ÄôAssociation des Officiers de R√©serve). Engineering education After the war, as the first major in the competition, Andr√© L√©v√™que was admitted to the famous √âcole polytechnique in 1919 and graduated, ranking first on 25 July 1921 . There was no diploma awarded by the polytechnic in those times). Later, he continued his studies at the √âcole des Mines and received his diploma in mining engineering [dipl√¥me d‚Äôing√©nieur des Mines] on 9 August. 1923. On 30 March 1928, Andr√© L√©v√™que defended his doctorate thesis entitled, Les lois de la transmission de chaleur par convection before a jury (MM. Koenigs, Fabry, Villat) of the Faculty of Science in Paris (Facult√© des Sciences de Paris). This thesis is published in full (192 printed pages) in the Annales des Mines, Tome XIII, p. 201-299, 305-362, 381-415. The most important part of his thesis deals with the derivation of an asymptotic equation of convective heat transfer in a fully developed flow (the L√©v√™que equation, p. 287), found on p. 283-299. The 47 references listed on p. 413-415, contain 24 papers of German authors, 13 of these, being from Wilhelm Nusselt, and one entitled Die W√§rme√ºbertragung im Rohr from the Festschrift zur Hundertjahrfeier der Technischen Hochschule Karlsruhe, 1925. Career as an engineer At the Corps de Mines, Andr√© L√©v√™que became an engineer in July 1923. He was put in charge of the mines in the sub arrondissement of Arras-East at his hometown in B√©thune in 1924, and of the sub arrondissement B√©thune East in 1927. In that same year, he was named Engineer-in-Chief of the first class. Personal life At B√©thune, on 24 July 1925, Andr√© L√©v√™que married Clotilde Marie Elise Foret who was born at Carvin on 19 February 1902. A daughter seems to have been born in 1925; unfortunately she died in 1928 at the age of three. In 1929, his son, Jean Andr√© Eug√®ne L√©v√™que, was born. Twenty years later, in 1949, the younger L√©v√™que was admitted to the Ecole polytechnique, the polytechnic that Andr√© L√©v√™que attended. Andr√© L√©v√™que died on 1 March 1930 from tuberculosis at Pau, in a suburb called Bizanos. This place, close to the Pyrenees, has been recommended to him by the doctors because of the better air quality. He was buried at Beauvais, where he was born, only 33 years and 4 months before.

The name derives from the Vlachs (Aromanians), who had lived across much of the area.  Name  The name derives from the Aromanians or Vlachs, a chiefly transhumant ethnic group that lives in several mountainous areas of the Balkans, descended from ancient Romance-speaking populations mixed with the people from the Barbarian Invasions of Late Antiquity. In the broadest sense, both Greek and Western sources of the later Middle Ages‚Äîlike the French, Italian, and Aragonese versions of the Chronicle of the Morea, or the chroniclers Ramon Muntaner and Marino Sanudo Torsello‚Äîused \\"Vlachia\\" or similar names (Blaquie, Blaquia, Val[l]achia) to refer to all of Thessaly, from the Pindus mountains in the west to the Aegean Sea in the east, and from the area of Mount Olympus and Servia in the north to the towns of Zetouni (Lamia) and Neopatras (Ypati) in the south. Thessalian Vlachia was apparently also known as \\"Vlachia in Hellas\\" (), as well as \\"Great Vlachia\\" (ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ ŒíŒªŒ±œáŒØŒ±), to distinguish it from other Vlach-inhabited areas, \\"Upper Vlachia\\" in Epirus, and a \\"Little Vlachia\\" in Aetolia-Acarnania. The contemporary Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates however distinguishes \\"Great Vlachia\\" as a district near Meteora. \\"Vlachia\\", \\"Great Vlachia\\", and the other variants began to fall out of use for Thessaly at the turn of the 14th century, and with the emergence of Wallachia north of the Danube, from the 15th century the name was reserved for it.  Thessalian Vlachs in the Middle Ages  The Vlachs of Thessaly first appear in Byzantine sources in the 11th century, in the Strategikon of Kekaumenos and Anna Komnene's Alexiad. Kekaumenos, who wrote in the late 1070s, in particular stresses both their transhumance as well as their disdain of imperial authorities. Kekaumenos records a failed Vlach uprising of 1066, under the unwilling leadership of Nikoulitzas Delphinas, a relative of his and grandson of the original Nikoulitzas, whom Emperor Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) placed to rule over the Thessalian Vlachs. Anna Komnene reports a Vlach settlement near Mount Ossa in 1083, in connection with the campaign of her father, Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118), against the Normans. In the 12th century, the Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela, who toured the area in 1166, recorded that the town of Zetouni (Lamia) was \\"situated at the foots of the hills of Vlachia\\". The term was evidently not simply a geographic or ethnic designation, for a chrysobull of Emperor Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195‚Äì1203) in 1198 includes the Provincia Valachie among the districts of Thessaly where Venetian merchants were granted exemptions, and the same information is repeated in the list of provinces granted to Boniface of Montferrat in the Partitio Romaniae of 1204. According to the Byzantinist George C. Soulis, from this information it appears that this late 12th-century Byzantine province of Vlachia \\"was situated in the Mount Othrys region, occupying the area lying between the towns of Lamia, Domokos and Halmyros\\". Despite their prominence in Thessaly, however, the Vlachs never came to rule over the region, submitting instead to the various Greek, Latin, and later Serb rulers. Following the Fourth Crusade and the capture of Thessaly by the Despotate of Epirus, the Vlachs were used by the Epirotes as elite troops against their rivals; the 13th-century scholar George Pachymeres comments on the bravery of the Megalovlachitai in the army of the ruler of Epirus, Michael II Komnenos Doukas (r. ca. 1230‚Äì1268). Michael's bastard son, John, was married to a Vlach, the daughter of the chieftain Taron, and his Vlach troops‚Äîit is unclear whether they were regular forces or perhaps a private army raised from his estates‚Äîplayed a prominent role in the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259. When Michael II died in ca. 1268, his realm was divided, and John became ruler of Thessaly, with his capital at Neopatras. Western authors often used the term \\"Vlachia\\" to refer to the autonomous Thessalian realm of John Doukas and his heirs. Part of Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, had remained in the hands of the Nicaean Empire, and after 1261 the restored Byzantine Empire, for several years after Pelagonia. This district was governed by a \\"kephale of Great Vlachia\\", a post held in 1276 by the pinkernes Raoul Komnenos. After the conquest of large parts of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-1340s, the Serbian ruler Stefan Dushan was crowned emperor in 1346, founding the Serbian Empire. In 1347‚Äì1348 he and his general Preljub extended Serbian control over Epirus and Thessaly. Afterwards, Stefan Dushan claimed the titles, in Latin, of imperator Raxie et Romanie, dispotus Lartae et Blachie comes (\\"Emperor of Rascia and Romania [Byzantine Empire], Despot of Arta and Count of Vlachia\\").

In statistics, marketing and demography, a cohort is a group of subjects who share a defining characteristic (typically subjects who experienced a common event in a selected time period, such as birth or graduation). Cohort data can oftentimes be more advantageous to demographers than period data. Because cohort data is honed to a specific time period, it is usually more accurate. It is more accurate because it can be tuned to retrieve custom data for a specific study. In addition, cohort data is not affected by tempo effects, unlike period data. On the contrary, cohort data can be disadvantageous in the sense that it can take a long amount of time to collect the data necessary for the cohort study. Another disadvantage of cohort studies is that it can be extremely costly to carry out, since the study will go on for a long period of time, demographers often require sufficient funds to fuel the study. Demography often contrasts cohort perspectives and period perspectives. For instance, the total cohort fertility rate is an index of the average completed family size for cohorts of women, but since it can only be known for women who have finished child-bearing, it cannot be measured for currently fertile women. It can be calculated as the sum of the cohort's age-specific fertility rates that obtain as it ages through time. In contrast, the total period fertility rate uses current age- specific fertility rates to calculate the completed family size for a notional woman, were she to experience these fertility rates through her life. A study on a cohort is a cohort study. Two important types of cohort studies are: # Prospective Cohort Study: In this type of study, there is a collection of exposure data (baseline data) from the subjects recruited before development of the outcomes of interest. The subjects are then followed through time (future) to record when the subject develops the outcome of interest. Ways to follow-up with subjects of the study include: phone interviews, face-to-face interviews, physical exams, medical/laboratory tests, and mail questionnaires. An example of a prospective cohort study is, for instance, if a demographer wanted to measure all the males births in the year 2018. The demographer would have to wait for the event to be over, the year 2018 must come to an end in order for the demographer to have all the necessary data. # Retrospective Cohort Study: Retrospective Studies start with subjects that are at risk to have the outcome or disease of interest and identifies the outcome starting from where the subject is when the study starts to the past of the subject to identify the exposure. Retrospective use records: clinical, educational, birth certificates, death certificates, etc. but that may be difficult because there may not be data for the study that is being initiated. These studies may have multiple exposures which may make this study difficult. On the other hand, an example of a retrospective cohort study is, if a demographer was examining a group of people born in year 1970 who have type 1 diabetes. The demographer would begin by looking at historical data. However, if the demographer was looking at ineffective data in attempts to deduce the source of type 1 diabetes, the demographers results would not be accurate.

Four Middle English Romances. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Western Michigan University for TEAMS. Octavian: Introduction. On stylistic evidence, there has always been some question whether these two flanking poems in Cotton Caligula A.ii might be attributed to Thomas Chester as well, with arguments on both sides.Schofield, William Henry. 1895. Studies on the Libeaus Desconus. Ginn and Company, Boston, for Harvard University. p 1.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969 Libeaus Desconus is found in five other medieval manuscripts. A 14th-century Middle English Octavian occurs in two other manuscripts in a version that is definitely not by Thomas Chestre, the story is arranged in a different way and it is known as the Northern Octavian. Style Many similarities have been noted in the way the poems Sir Launfal, Libeaus Desconus and the Southern Octavian have been written. The underlying dialect of all three works is best interpreted as being of the southeast English Midlands,Mills, Maldwyn (Ed), 1969, p 34. although the scribe of British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A.ii. might have been from Kent.Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 1 All three works display the same eclectic style of composition. The difficulty in assigning a more precise indication of the region of England that Thomas Chestre may have hailed from lies in the readiness of all three works to borrow lines and phrases directly from other Middle English romances.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969, p 35. Thomas Chestre was prepared to go to any lengths to secure a rhyme.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969, p 36. In addition, he was willing to ‚Äúendow words with new or at least strained meanings, and introduce notions that are either quite at odds with the immediate context of the rhyme-word embodying them, or conflict with statements made a very short time earlier.‚Äù All three of these romances show this idiosyncrasy and produce narrative that is both ‚Äúterse in its statements and disjointed in its continuity.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969, p 65. In both Sir Launfal and Libeaus Desconus, story elements from more than one romance have been stitched together to make the tale as a whole,Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969, p 50. and some allusions to his sources are very condensed.‚ÄùMills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969, p 55. Like many Middle English poets working with older material, he shows a preference to reduce moral ambiguity and to avoid any great agonising over love.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969, p 63. Chestre's subject matter and inspiration Nothing is known of Thomas Chester outside of the one verse romance he is known to have penned and the two that lie either side of it in British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A.ii. Octavian is a tale of a young prince who is taken as a baby by an animal and reared as the son of a merchant, before displaying his noble qualities, fighting with a giant, winning great martial acclaim and finally being reunited with his real family again. It has many of the traits of folk-tale or Breton lai.Brewer, Derek. 1983. History of Literature Series: English Gothic Literature.Schocken Books, New York, pp 81‚Äì82. Following this in the manuscript, Sir Launfal is an Arthurian tale in which King Arthur's steward is reduced to dire poverty, meets with an Otherworld fay in a woodland whom he falls in love with and is magically restored to great wealth again. It is based ultimately upon one of the 12th-century Breton lais recorded by Marie de France, the lay Lanval, via a Middle English romance Sir Landevale, an Old French lay of Graelent and a lost romance that might have included a giant named Sir Valentyne. Following this, Libeaus Desconus is another Arthurian tale., in which a young man who does not know his own name journeys from King Arthur's court to a city in which a lady is kept prisoner. She is finally rescued by him with a kiss, upon which she changes from a snake into a beautiful maiden. On the way to her city, the hero has already encountered another lady of enchantments, an elf-queen, and defeated a giant who was guarding her. The ultimate sources for this tale might be a lost 12th-century Old French romance upon which Le Bel Inconnu was based, and Chr√©tien de Troyes' Erec and Enide.Schofield, William Henry. 1895.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969. Geoffrey Chaucer's parody of tail-line romance in his Canterbury Tale of Sir Thopas, has the hero Sir Thopas begin a fight with a giant in order to try to reach an elf-queen with whom he wishes to fall in love. It mentions Libeaus Desconus in its list of excellent romances, or ‚Äúromances of prys‚Äù.eChaucer ‚Äì texts: http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/chaucer/texts/ct/18thop07.txt lines Thop 897‚Äì900.

He has been the stills photographer on the BBC filming teams that made Michael Palin's television travel programmes. Early career Pao was born in Hong Kong, but started his career as an art director and graphic designer in New York and Los Angeles. His work during that time included making numerous record covers and posters for Atlantic Records, Polygram and Warner Bros. Records. During this time, Pao also met Michael Palin, when they worked together on the book for the Monty Python film Life of Brian in 1979. The following year, Pao designed the LP cover for Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album. In 1980, Pao returned to Hong Kong and took up photography as his new career. Michael Palin trips When Michael Palin was doing his first trip for the BBC in 1988, Around the World in Eighty Days, he asked Basil Pao to show him around Hong Kong when he arrived there. After a couple of days in Hong Kong, Palin asked Pao to accompany the BBC team on the stretch from Hong Kong to Shanghai to act as guide and interpreter, and Pao agreed. Many of the photographs between Hong Kong and Shanghai used in the book that Palin later wrote about this trip, Around the World in 80 Days, were taken by Pao. In 1992, when Palin and the BBC were planning to make a new travel programme, Pole to Pole, they decided that it would be a good idea to have a full-time stills photographer on the team, and that Pao was a top candidate for the job. Pao accepted, and, except for the very first few days and the very last few days (he missed out on the two poles due to lack of space in the small aircraft used at both ends of the trip) it was exclusively his pictures that were used in the follow-on book that Palin wrote, Pole to Pole with Michael Palin. Pao took 30,000 pictures on the Pole to Pole trip, and together with BBC Books released a large format book with some of these pictures, Pole to Pole - The Photographs. Palin wrote some introductory text and lent his name to the cover, but the book was almost completely dedicated to Pao's pictures, some of them displayed in two-page spreads. The success of the collaboration on Pole to Pole marked the start of a long tradition. Each of the following Michael Palin trips for the BBC included Basil Pao on the team as the stills photographer, and it was almost exclusively Pao's pictures that were used in the follow-up book that Palin wrote about each trip. These books are Full Circle, Hemingway Adventure, Sahara, Himalaya and New Europe. As well as providing pictures for the Michael Palin books, Basil Pao made three additional photography books: Full Circle - The Photographs, Inside Sahara, and Inside Himalaya. Palin's name is featured on each of these books and he provided some introductory text, but these books are otherwise exclusively about Pao's pictures. There are no Basil Pao photography books related to Hemingway Adventure or New Europe, although he was on the team for those trips too. Other activities Basil Pao's photographs have been used in books and magazines all over the world. He took photographs for Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor and Il piccolo Buddha (Little Buddha), and held the photographic exhibitions Glimpses of Silence and The Last Emperor Collection across Asia and Europe. He has also produced several other photography books, including China Revealed (publisher Weidenfeld & Nicolson) and limited edition books Aman and Bhutan for publisher Amanresorts. He lately released a book called Hands containing only pictures of people's hands from all over the world. Pao also performed as an actor in the role of Zaifeng, Prince Chun and assistant director in The Last Emperor.

There is an OS trig point on the summit. The walk to the summit is usually from the road at Astley's Plantation car park, itself at over 200 metres above sea level, and only 700 metres from the summit. Although short and easy by most standards, and popular with families, it has many of the characteristics of a walk in the higher Lakeland fells, with some (short) steep slopes, rocks to negotiate, and rowan, bracken and heather.

The use of the names 'weald' and 'wald' in the 12th century indicate the influence of woods. What was the Roman Ermine Street, now the A1198 road, bisects Caxton parish. The modern village has grown up around the road, although the church is a short distance south-west, along Gransden Road. There are also three medieval moated sites further from the road: Caxton Moats, which has signs of Anglo-Saxon or Norman occupation; Caxton Pastures, south- west of Caxton Gibbet, which may have belonged to John of Caxton, a 13th- century landowner; and Swansley, south-east of the gibbet. St Peter's Street (or, Lane), north and east of the church, may have been the centre of the original village.'Parishes: Caxton', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 5 (1973), pp. 26-35. Date accessed: 27 July 2008 The road provided passing trade; the market was held next to it and the Crown and George inns were built there. Parts of the Crown inn date from the 15th century and it was known by that name by 1545. Caxton benefitted from travellers passing through but highway robbers could also be a problem. The road became busier after the 16th century and a post office was opened at the Crown inn 'many years' before 1660. By the mid-18th century, Caxton post office was one of only two in the whole county. After the end of the coaching era, Caxton declined. In 1863, a traveller described the village as \\"a small, rambling village, which looked as if it had not shaved and washed its face, and put on a clean shirt for a shocking length of time\\". Fires in 1896 and 1897 destroyed more than a dozen houses and, although the arrival of the motor car brought traffic back through the village, its former prosperity did not return. In 2004 a bypass was completed around Caxton to accommodate traffic for the newly built Cambourne to the north.

It stands on the A1198 (Ermine Street, the Old North Road) between the villages of Papworth Everard, to the north, and Longstowe, to the south. Roads run from Caxton to the villages of Bourn and Great Gransden.Ordnance Survey: www.getamap.co.uk It ranges from 44 to 68 metres above sea level and the soil is clay with a blue gault subsoil.GENUKI: Caxton Bourn Brook runs through Caxton, eventually joining the River Cam. Sport Speedway racing was staged at Caxton. The venue was described as being on the main Cambridge to St Neots road near Caxton Gibbet. The first meeting was staged on 6 April 1931 and a number of Sunday afternoon events were staged that year and again in 1932. Fewer meetings appear to have been staged 1933 and further research is needed to ascertain other activity. A greyhound racing track was opened adjacent to the speedway track on 11 September 1932. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. Totalisator and refreshment facilities were available in addition to a free car park. Demography At the time of the 2001 census, the population of Caxton parish was 480 people. All residents were white and 72% described themselves as Christian, with 27.8% either having no religion or stating none.Cambridgeshire County Council: Parish Census Profiles In 1881 the population was 129, and in 1921 the population had grown to 398.

Life  Daughter of Queen Tamar of Georgia by David Soslan, she succeeded her brother George IV of Georgia on January 18, 1223. George‚Äôs untimely death marked the beginning of the end of the Georgian Golden Age. Rusudan was unable to preserve whatever was gained by her mother and brother. She was known as a beautiful woman devoted to pleasure, whose hand was sought by her Muslim neighbors. In Muslim sources, such as Ata-Malik Juvayni, Rusudan was known as Qiz-Malik, from the Turkish qiz, \\"maiden\\", and the Arabic malik, \\"king\\".Minorsky, Vladimir, \\"Tiflis\\", in: M. Th. Houtsma, E. van Donzel (1993), E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, p. 756. Brill, In the autumn of 1225, Georgia was attacked by the Khwarezm shah Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, pursued by the Mongols. The Georgians suffered bitter defeat at the Battle of Garni, and the royal court with Queen Rusudan moved to Kutaisi, when the Georgian capital Tbilisi was besieged by the Khwarezmians. A year later Jelal ad-Din took Tbilisi on 9 March 1226. The citizens fought courageously and over 100,000 lost their lives when the city fell to the Khwarezmians. The defeated Georgians were ordered to change religion and become Muslims, but refused and almost the whole population of Tbilisi was massacred. In February 1227, the Georgians took advantage of Jelal ad-Din‚Äôs failures in Armenia, and retook Tbilisi, but soon were forced to abandon the city ‚Äì which they themselves had set alight in their battle with the occupation forces. Rusudan made an alliance with the neighbouring Seljuk rulers of R√ºm and Ahlat, but the Georgians were routed by the Khwarezmians at Battle of Bolnisi, before the allies could arrive (1228). The Khwarezmians were superseded by the Mongols. They advanced into Georgia in 1235. Devastated and plundered by Jelal ad-Din‚Äôs incursions, Georgia surrendered without any serious resistance. By 1240 all the country was under the Mongol yoke. Forced to accept the sovereignty of the Mongol Khan in 1242, Rusudan had to pay an annual tribute of 50,000 gold pieces and support the Mongols with a Georgian army. Fearing that her nephew David VII of Georgia would aspire to the throne, Rusudan held him prisoner at the court of her son-in-law, the sultan Kaykhusraw II, and sent her son David VI of Georgia to the Mongol court to get his official recognition as heir apparent. She died in 1245, still waiting for her son to return.  Marriage and children  She married in 1224 to the Seljuk prince Ghias ad-Din, a grandson of Kilij Arslan II who converted to Christianity on his marriage. They were the parents of David VI of Georgia and a daughter named Tamar, who married her cousin, the sultan Kaykhusraw II, and following his death in 1246, the Pervane Mu'in al-Din Suleyman as one of the preconditions of the peace settlement.

The technology assists drivers in parking their vehicle. On vehicles equipped with the IPAS, via an in-dash screen and button controls, the car can steer itself into a parking space with little input from the user. The first version of the system was deployed on the Prius Hybrid sold in Japan in 2003. In 2006, an upgraded version debuted for the first time outside Japan on the Lexus LS luxury sedan, which featured the automatic parking technology among other brand new inventions from Toyota. In 2009, the system appeared on the third generation Prius sold in the U.S. In Asia and Europe, the parking technology is marketed as the Intelligent Park Assist System for both Lexus and Toyota models, while in the U.S. the Advanced Parking Guidance System name is only used for the Lexus system. Development The initial version of the Intelligent Parking Assist System, launched in 2003, was designed for reverse parallel parking. Driver intervention was not required, as the system estimated the size of the parking space and maneuvered the vehicle appropriately. This was done by an onboard computer which used a camera built into the forward and rear of the car. Sensors located at similar locations detected the proximity of nearby vehicles. The dashboard displayed an image of the lot, and the driver would then have to determine the exact position that the vehicle in the lot via the arrows which appeared on the screen. Using the arrows, the user would set the location of the vehicle in the space. When satisfied, the user pressed the \\"Set\\" button, which then IPAS. The system then took over steering control to maneuver the vehicle. Early versions of this system had difficulty detecting objects, including cats, baby prams and pedestrians. Secondly when the driver activated the system in a too small a space, the system constantly flashed warning signals to inform the user of the danger of hitting the vehicle. User assistance is required in such situations. In 2005, an upgraded version added recognition capability for parking stripes. A later version of this parking technology, launched in 2006, added integration with parking sensors. This latest version could calculate the steering maneuvers needed for parallel or reverse parking, and help determine that the car has enough clearance for a particular space with colored screen displays which indicated adequate or inadequate space. How it works=Technology Demonstration of the parallel parking system on a Toyota Prius The IPAS/APGS use computer processors which are tied to the vehicle's sonar warning system feature, backup camera, and two additional forward sensors on the front side fenders. The sonar park sensors, known as \\"Intuitive Parking Assist\\" or \\"Lexus Park Assist\\", include multiple sensors on the forward and rear bumpers which detect obstacles, allowing the vehicle to sound warnings and calculate optimum steering angles during regular parking. These sensors plus the two additional parking sensors are tied to a central computer processor, which in turn is integrated with the backup camera system to provide the driver parking information. When the sonar park sensors feature is used, the processor(s) calculate steering angle data which are displayed on the navigation/camera touchscreen along with obstacle information. The Intelligent Parking Assist System expands on this capability and is accessible when the vehicle is shifted to reverse (which automatically activates the backup camera). When in reverse, the backup camera screen features parking buttons which can be used to activate automated parking procedures. When the Intelligent Parking Assist System is activated, the central processor calculates the optimum parallel or reverse park steering angles and then interfaces with the Electric Power Steering systems of the vehicle to guide the car into the parking spot. Functions Newer versions of the system allow parallel or reverse parking. When parallel parking with the system, drivers first pull up alongside the parking space. They move forward until the vehicle's rear bumper passes the rear wheel of the car parked in front of the open space. Then, shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the car's rear view appears on dash navigation/camera display. The driver's selection of the parallel park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen causes a grid to appear (with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing the corner of the parking spot, and adjustment arrows). Demonstration of the automatic parking system on a Lexus LS The driver is responsible for checking to see if the representative box on the screen correctly identifies the parking space; if the space is large enough to park, the box will be green in color; if the box is incorrectly placed, or lined in red, using the arrow buttons moves the box until it turns green. Once the parking space is correctly identified, the driver presses OK and takes his/her hands off the steering wheel, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal. When the driver slowly releases the brake, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal, the car will then begin to back up and steer itself into the parking space. The reverse parking procedure is virtually identical to the parallel parking procedure. The driver approaches the parking space, moving forward and turning, positioning the car in place for backing into the reverse parking spot. The vehicle rear has to be facing the reverse parking spot, allowing the backup camera to 'see' the parking area. Shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the driver selects the reverse park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing the corner of the parking spot, and adjustment arrows; reverse parking adds rotation selection). After checking the parking space and engaging the reverse park procedure, the same exact parking process occurs as the car reverse parks into the spot. The system is set up so that at any time the steering wheel is touched or the brake firmly pressed, the automatic parking will disengage. The vehicle also cannot exceed a set speed, or the system will deactivate. When the car's computer voice issues the statement \\"The guidance is finished\\", the system has finished parking the car. The driver can then shift to drive and make adjustments in the space if necessary. Media coverage=Press reports Lexus LS parking demonstration on \\"Oprah\\" The debut of the parking technology in the United States in 2006 received widespread media attention, with demonstrations performed on television shows ranging from cable news programming to The Oprah Winfrey Show. In automotive publications, the feature garnered mixed reviews, with opinions on its utility varying from useful to impractical, depending on the parking situation and driver. A video from CNBC showed the system working \\"quite effectively\\" with a first-time user and other reviewers found that the system worked smoothly. A video produced by Automobile Magazine demonstrates how the system makes parking more difficult, due to some complexity to the touchscreen. * A demonstration by Winding Road magazine. Advertising Lexus capitalized on the debut of the parking system in the U.S. with its LS flagship with two ads. The first, \\"Pyramid,\\" depicted a driver parking a car between two stacks of glasses using the system. A second ad showing a montage of different technologies, followed finally by a demonstration of the parallel park feature, and a man stating that he never thought this technology could possibly exist. The system was also referenced by competitors Audi and Hyundai in their own advertisements. Audi marketed their 2007 A4 as \\"the luxury car for people who can park themselves,\\" and showed a professional driver swing into a tight parallel parking space. Hyundai's advertisement for the 2007 Azera listed a side-by- side feature comparison between the Azera and the LS460, reaching a conclusion that although the Azera lacks the style, luxury, performance, class, and comfort of the LS, its savings can pay for valet.

Its route is to/through the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and the Angeles National Forest. With the exception of a -long section in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, the entire route is part of California State Route 2. The road is in length, with its western terminus at the intersection at Foothill Boulevard in La Ca√±ada Flintridge and its eastern terminus at the Pearblossom Highway (State Route 138) northeast of Wrightwood. The majority of the route passes through the San Gabriel Mountains located north of the Greater Los Angeles Area. Segments of the road reach altitudes above , with a summit of at the Dawson Saddle, which makes this road one of the highest in Southern California. The segment from La Ca√±ada Flintridge to the Los Angeles‚ÄìSan Bernardino county line is known as the Angeles Crest Scenic Byway, which is both a National Forest Scenic Byway and an officially designated California Scenic Highway.  Route description  Red Box Saddle Angeles Crest Highway in the Angeles National Forest The Angeles Crest Highway winds through the mountains. The clouds in the distance cover Los Angeles. The Angeles Crest Highway in the Angeles National Forest The route is best described as mountain-rural. Because the route passes through the protected San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and Angeles National Forest, development is very limited. There are not many buildings between La Ca√±ada Flintridge and Wrightwood save for Newcomb's Ranch, and forest service campgrounds and visitor centers. Other points of interest along the route include the Mountain High and Mt. Waterman ski areas. Mount Wilson and its Mount Wilson Observatory and various radio/television transmitters are about 4.5 miles from the junction of Mount Wilson Road and Angeles Crest Highway. Depending on visibility conditions, impressive views of the Los Angeles Basin are possible from the vicinity of Mount Wilson. The most frequent hindrances of what can be seen are the smog and/or a marine layer covering the basin below. The westernmost segment of the highway, combined with Angeles Forest Highway to/from State Route 14, is heavily travelled by southbound traffic in the morning (and corresponding northbound traffic in the afternoon) that comprises commuters who live in the Antelope Valley and work in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The route is a convenient alternative to the Antelope Valley Freeway (State Route 14) and the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5), both located to the west, for reaching the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) and San Gabriel Valley. Because the road is a two-lane highway, its vehicle capacity is significantly lower than either of the two freeways. In contrast, the remainder of the Angeles Crest Highway is lightly traveled. Typically, this traffic is composed of vacationers, sightseers, and locals. The three areas comprising Mountain High ski resort are just west of Wrightwood. History San Gabriel Range for Angeles Crest Highway, 1949 Construction of Angeles Crest Highway began in 1929. It was originally intended to be a fire access road. In 1941 construction stopped because of World War II. In 1946, after the war, construction resumed; the completed highway eventually opened in 1956. The road was constructed by prison labor from Camp 37, which has since been razed. Division of Highways (now known as CalTrans) staff lived at a site called Cedar Springs. The staff is now located at Chilao Flats. Children of the staff attended Chilao Mountain School, a one-room school; the school has been closed for several years. Angeles Crest Highway was originally planned to be upgraded to a freeway in the 1950s, but was later considered geographically improbable and the plans were abandoned. Roads in the San Gabriel Mountains have a high number of single-vehicle auto and motorcycle accidents. As an example, in the predawn hours of December 8, 2004, a van plunged off the side of Angeles Forest Highway at about north of its junction with the Angeles Crest Highway, killing 3 of the 10 people in the van. The van was a carpool carrying workers of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from the Antelope Valley to work in Pasadena. It was determined upon investigation by the CHP that the driver fell asleep at the wheel of the van. The Angeles Crest Highway and Angeles Forest Highway have figured in various murders, not as scenes of the murders but as drop-off points for the bodies of the victims, including that of Linda Sobek, a model kidnapped and found dead in the area in 1995. The motion picture Donnie Darko, released in 2001, was partially filmed on Angeles Crest Highway. In the opening scene with Donnie waking up in the middle of the road, next to his bike, the camera zooms in on Donnie, then loops around and shows a view of the valley seen from Angeles Crest Highway. The highway is also used later in the movie for other scenes. The Angeles Crest Highway is also used extensively in the motion picture The Love Bug for racing scenes, as well as in the sequel film Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, where the highway doubles for \\"The French Alps\\". Access and closures Signage near the western terminus warning of road closures Debris being removed by the Highway Patrol Intersections with other roads are few, which can be problematic in the event of road closures due to acts of nature such as landslides and fires. At about the midpoint of the highway is the junction with the north terminus of State Route 39. However, access to State Route 39 is not possible as it is closed indefinitely to automobile traffic because of persistent landslides along its route. Therefore, travelers to the Angeles National Forest preferring the Angeles Crest Highway corridor should expect to be on the Angeles Crest Highway throughout much of its length, use available alternate routing where possible, or be willing to turn around and retrace their trip at any point along its route if necessary. The Angeles Crest Highway is normally closed in the winter from Islip Saddle to Vincent Gap due to rockfall and avalanche hazards. The winter storms of 2004/05 caused several landslides and significant damage to the highway. Thus, the highway never reopened in the summer of 2005. Damage to the highway was estimated to be over $4 million as of November 2005. Terri Kasinga, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, stated in November 2005 \\"It is definitely not going to open until next spring (of 2006)\\". However, a March 2006 storm caused even more extensive damage to the highway, including a complete washout of a large section of roadway, further delaying the reopening of the highway. The long closure caused concern for the United States Forest Service and other emergency services agencies because it hindered access, particularly with firefighting efforts, and it hurt business in Wrightwood. After a four-and-a- half year closure, the highway reopened on May 20, 2009. Repairs included the construction of a new bridge intended to allow landslides to pass underneath without damaging the road. The work cost $10.5 million.\\"Angeles Crest Highway through Wrightwood reopens\\" By Nathan McIntire, Staff Writer Posted: 5/20/2009 4:34:02 pm PDT Pasadena Star News A moratorium on three-axles trucks was imposed in 2009 following the deaths of two people when a tractor trailer lost control and crashed into a La Ca√±ada Flintridge business (other California highways have similar truck bans such as I-580 and SR 85 but have been implemented for different reasons). Cell phone reception can be sporadic and, when available, signal strength and clarity is poor. Although the surrounding mountainous terrain is the primary reason for this, the limited presence of, and/or proximity to, cellular communication antennas to receive and transmit signals along the route contributes to the problem. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act passed in December 2004, protects the Angeles National Forest. Although anyone can park at the side of the road and access the wilderness along the side of the road, doing so for extended periods of time, such as camping or hiking, requires a National Forest Adventure Pass available for a $5.00 fee.  2009 Station Fire closure  During the 2009 wildfire season the large fire known as the \\"Station Fire\\" burned the mountains through which Route 2 travels. The fire damaged the signs, guardrails, and lane striping, as well as leaving large boulders and other debris all over the road. As a result, the highway was closed by Caltrans until November 30, 2009. It was briefly re-opened until mud and rock slides in early 2010 forced a portion of the highway to be closed again from 2 miles east of the I-210 junction to 14 miles east of La Ca√±ada Flintridge. It reopened on June 3, 2011.

He was previously presbyter and steward, oikonomos, of the great church at Constantinople (Chronicon Paschale, p. 378). Gregory the Great received the legates bearing the synodal letters which announced his consecration, partly from a desire not to disturb the peace of the church, and partly from the personal respect which he entertained for Cyriac; but in his reply he warned him against the sin of causing divisions in the church, clearly alluding to the use of the term oecumenical bishop, which Gregory interpreted as meaning \\"universal\\" or even \\"exclusive\\" bishop (Gregory, Ep. lib. vii. 4, Patrologia Latina lxxvii. 853). The personal feelings of Gregory towards Cyriac appear most friendly. Cyriacus did not attend to Gregory's entreaties that he abstain from using the title, for Gregory wrote afterwards both to him and to the emperor Maurice, declaring that he could not allow his legates to remain in communion with Cyriac as long as he retained it. In the latter of these letters he compares the assumption of the title to the sin of Antichrist, since both exhibit a spirit of lawless pride. \\"Quisquis se universalem sacerdotem vocat, vel vocari desiderat, in elatione sua Antichristum praecurrit\\" (whosoever calls himself universal priest, or desires to be called so, is the forerunner of the Antichrist) (Gregory Ep. 28, 30). In a letter to Anastasius I of Antioch, who had written to him to remonstrate against disturbing the peace of the church, Gregory defends his conduct on the ground of the injury which Cyriac had done to all other patriarchs by the assumption of the title, and reminds Anastasius that not only heretics but heresiarchs had before this been patriarchs of Constantinople. He also deprecates the use of the term on more general grounds (Ep. 24). In spite of all this Cyriacus was firm in his retention of the title, and appears to have summoned, or to have meditated summoning, a council to authorize its use. For in 599 Gregory wrote to Eusebius of Thessalonica and some other bishops, stating that he had heard they were about to be summoned to a council at Constantinople, and most urgently entreating them to yield neither to force nor to persuasion, but to be steadfast in their refusal to recognize the offensive title (ib. lib. ix. 68 in Patr. Lat.). Cyriacus appears to have shared in that unpopularity of the emperor Maurice which caused his deposition and death (Theophanes Chronicle, A.M. 6094; Niceph. Callis. H. E. xviii. 40; Theophylact. Hist. viii. 9). He still, however, had influence enough to exact from Phocas at his coronation a confession of the orthodox faith and a pledge not to disturb the church (Theophanes Chronicle, A.M. 6094). He also nobly resisted the attempt of Phocas to drag the empress Constantina and her daughters from their sanctuary in a church of Constantinople (ibid., A.M. 6098). Perhaps some resentment at this opposition to his will may have induced Phocas to accede more readily to the claims of Pope Boniface III that Rome should be considered to be the head of all the church, in exclusion of the claims of Constantinople to the oecumenical bishopric (Vita Bonifacii III, in Labbe, Acta Concil. t. v. 1615). Cyriac died in 606, and was interred in the church of the Holy Apostles (Chronicon Paschale, p. 381). He appears to have been a man of remarkable piety and earnestness, able to win the esteem of all parties. He built a church dedicated to the theotokos in a street of Constantinople called Diaconissa (Theophanes Chronicle, A.M. 6090; Niceph. Callis. H. E. xviii. 42).

She was built in 1988 by Brodosplit in Croatia, then Yugoslavia. Amorella has sister ships Gabriella in the Viking Line fleet, Isabelle operated by Tallink and a third one, Crown Seaways, operated by DFDS Seaways. History In Turku Harbor before a voyage to Stockholm Amorella was ordered in 1986 by SF Line, one of the partners in Viking Line consortium. Although Brodosplit outbid other shipyards, the Finnish State offered to subsidise construction of the ship if she was built at a Finnish shipyard. This was a common practice in the 1980s to bring more jobs to Finland, but this time SF Line declined and had the ship built in Croatia. The original planned delivery date for Amorella was in March 1988, but due to delays in construction she was not completed until September, which meant SF Line was forced to operate the lucrative summer season with old tonnage. Except for short periods of time in 1997, 1998 and 2002, Amorella has always served on the Turku‚ÄìMariehamn/L√•ngn√§s‚ÄìStockholm route, making her the longest-lasting ship on that route. Originally she only called in Mariehamn during day crossing, but in July 1999 she had to start calling at the √Öland Islands in both directions to maintain tax free sales on board, and as a result a call at L√•ngn√§s was added to the night crossing. Like all ships, Amorella has suffered occasional misfortune. In 1993 the ship ran aground near Stockholm. She was able to come off by her own power, but her bottom was damaged in the process; she started taking in water and diesel oil leaked from a damaged fuel tank. The ship continued to Stockholm, and after unloading passengers and cargo she sailed to Turku Repair Yard, Naantali for repairs. Arriving at Mariehamn from Turku, 2019 In 1995, and again in 2001, there was a fire in one of the cabins but the ship's own firefighters managed to put it out. In May 2005 there was a fire in a car parked on the cardeck on Deck 5, but that too was put out by the ship's crew. In March 2010, the ship had to be rescued by ice breakers after becoming stranded in thick ice along with several other vessels. During this stranding, Amorella collided with the Finnlines ship Finnfellow which resulted in a large dent on the port side hull. Nobody was injured in the collision. On 14 December 2013, MS Amorella lost her steering due to a blackout and ran aground with about 2,000 passengers on board.Viking Amorella karilla ‚Äì \\"Jotkut ovat itkeneet\\". Ilta- Sanomat, 14 December 2013. The only hull damage that occurred was a breach into a bow ballast tank. Therefore, no environmental damage occurred and there was no leak into the vessel. After being stuck for about twelve hours she was able continue her journey to Mariehamn under her own power. Ilta-Sanomat, 14 December 2013. On 20 September 2020, MS Amorella contacted the bottom with 207 and 74 crew aboard. The ship was intentionally run aground to stabilize the vessel. Future Isabella, the sister ship which sailed in pair with Amorella, was replaced by Viking Line's newbuilding Viking Grace in January 2013. Viking Line had an option for a sister ship for the same route but announced in May 2012 that they have decided not to build it. Amorella will therefore continue her traffic as normal as Viking Line has not made any announcements regarding future plans for the ship. This wouldn¬¥t be until January 2017 when Viking Line announced that they would sell Amorella in 2020 as there will be new ship at late Q1/early Q2 2020.

In 2014, Justice Ling-Cohan was appointed to the Appellate Term, First Department. She is the first woman of Asian descent to be appointed to an appellate panel in New York state. Ling-Cohan was born in Chinatown, Manhattan, the daughter of Chinese immigrants. Education She received a degree in psychology (summa cum laude) from Brooklyn College, in 1976. She was admitted into New York University's School of Law on a full scholarship, from which she graduated in 1979. Professional life Judge Ling-Cohan began her career as an attorney working for several New York Legal Services agencies, representing indigent clients, before she joined the New York State Attorney General's consumer fraud protection unit. Additionally, she taught classes in law and Asian American studies at CUNY School of Law, New York University, City College, and Queens College. In 1995 Judge Ling- Cohan was elected to the Civil Court of the City of New York from the Second Municipal Court District. At this time, Judge Ling-Cohan decided to seek elected positions rather than appointed ones, believing that judges who are continually tested by public opinion have a greater chance of later being elected to the State Supreme Court. In 2002, after being nominated by the Manhattan Democratic party for election to the New York State Supreme Court, she received the support of the state Republican, Democratic, Liberal, and Working Family parties. Ling-Cohan was elected to that post, receiving more than 230,000 votes. Judge Ling-Cohan is a member of several professional and humanitarian associations; she is a founding member of the Asian American Bar Association and the New York Asian Women's Center -- which is the first group dedicated to the prevention of domestic violence in New York City's Asian communities. Additionally, she is a member of the Jade Council, an organization for Asian court employees. Brooklyn College has honored Judge Ling-Cohan with its Distinguished Alumna Award, in recognition of her service to New York city as well as her advocacy for immigrants and non-English speakers' rights. Same-sex marriage Judge Ling-Cohan made national news when she handed down a ruling in Hernandez v. Robles, a case in which five gay and lesbian couples had sued New York, arguing that denying them marriage rights violated the state constitution. Ling-Cohan sided with the plaintiffs, and as of February 15, 2005, the ruling was on hold pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the state. See Judge Ling-Cohan's ruling in Hernandez v. Robles (PDF file) The decision was subsequently reversed by two appellate courts; however, same-sex marriage in the state of New York became legal on July 24, 2011, under the Marriage Equality Act, which was passed by the New York State Legislature on June 24, 2011 and signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo on the same day.

Life Charter of King George IV. A son of Queen Regnant Tamar and her consort David Soslan, George was declared as a coregent by his mother in 1207. He had princely domain in Javakheti, centered at Alastani, for which he was known by the title of javakht' up'ali, i.e., \\"the Lord of the Javakhians\\" as suggested by a type of silver coins struck in his name. George IV continued Tamar's policy of strengthening of the Georgia feudal state. He put down the revolts in neighbouring Muslim vassal states in the 1210s and began preparations for a large-scale campaign against Jerusalem to support the Crusaders in 1220. However, the Mongol approach to the Georgian borders made the Crusade plan unrealistic. The first Mongol expedition defeated two Georgian armies in 1221‚Äì1222 and left through Inner Caucasus. Georgians suffered heavy losses in this war and the King himself was severely wounded. King Georgi IV went to Bagavan, Armenia, to secure his sister's marriage to the Shah of Shirvan and ensure her succession.Gracias, Luke - The Devil's Prayer - Australian eBook Publisher, 2016, pp 350-351 Lasha George became an invalid and died prematurely in Bagavan at the age of 31. He was succeeded by his sister Rusudan. George Lasha was known as an open minded person and met much criticism from a conservative feudal society. The nobles and Christian clergymen rejected his wife and failed to recognize her as queen. She was a girl from a family of commoners. Ultimately, the King had to compromise and divorced her formally, refusing, however, to marry anyone else. Some medieval sources characterize George IV as a wise ruler and brave warrior, while others point to his immoral life style and addiction to mysticism and even Sufism. He was survived by a son David (the future King David VII Ulu). George was buried at Gelati monastery.

The CQBR features a barrel 10.3 in (262 mm) in length, similar to the Colt Commando short-barreled M16 variants of the past. This shorter barrel makes the weapon significantly more compact, which makes it easier to use in and around vehicles and in tight confined spaces. Special units such as commandos boarding ships and bodyguards for senior officers have found such shortened weapons very useful and use the CQBR. Its preliminary National Stock Number was 1005-LL-L99-5996; however, a complete CQBR-equipped carbine now has the NSN 1005-01-527-2288. The overall length of the upper receiver is 19.25 inches (489 mm). With the stock retracted, the overall length of the weapon is 26.75 inches (679.4 mm). Background The M4 carbine and M16 are not ideally suited for all missions, so it was proposed that the modularity of the M16 series would allow a user to replace the upper receiver of an existing weapon with one more suitable to the task. One of two proposed special mission receivers that were planned for inclusion into the SOPMOD Block II kit, the CQBR has taken off on its own. Like the proposed Special Purpose Receiver, the Close Quarters Battle Receiver has been more or less taken on by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (often referred to as NSWC-Crane or just \\"Crane\\") as its own project following the CQBR's removal from the SOPMOD program. Just as the Special Purpose Receiver morphed into the Special Purpose Rifle, and was type- classified as Mk 12 Mod 0/1, the complete CQBR-equipped carbine has been type- classified as the Mk 18 Mod 0, or the Mk 18 Mod 1 with a sightless gas block and full-length accessory rail kit. The purpose of the CQBR remains to provide operators with a weapon of submachine gun size, but firing a rifle cartridge, for scenarios such as VIP protection, urban warfare, and other close quarters battle (CQB) situations. The CQBR is designed to provide improvement over previous AR-15/M16-type weapons in this category. The CQBR is usually issued as a complete weapon system, and not just an upper receiver. The CQBR was once only available to Naval Special Warfare units (and by extension, other US Special Operations Forces units), but the Mk 18 Mod 0 has become general issue for Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) missions and, as of 2006, for NCIS agents deploying to active combat zones. The Mk 18 is also used by the Coast Guard's Tactical Law Enforcement Teams and Maritime Security Response Teams and the United States Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Operators. It is also used by Marine Force Recon's CQB operators, and is in most cases the standard weapons of choice for said operators where the range and accuracy of an M4 is not necessary. The short 10.3 in (262 mm) barrel length requires special modifications to reliably function. The gas port is opened from 0.062 to 0.070 in (1.6 to 1.8 mm). A one-piece McFarland gas ring replaces the three-piece gas ring set. The standard four-coil extractor spring is replaced with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) five-coil spring. An O-ring surrounds the extractor spring. The standard M4 flash hider has been replaced with the M4QD flash hider for suppressor compatibility.

The buffer in the host carbine would be used or upgraded as necessary via the supply system same as type 2. * CQBR type 3: Colt-contracted upper complete with all accessories. NO buffer supplied. The buffer in the host carbine would be used or upgraded as necessary via the supply system same as type 2. * CQBR type 3A: Colt-contracted upper naked without any accessories or buffer supplied. The buffer in the host carbine would be used or upgraded as necessary via the supply system same as type 2. * MK18 type 1: NSWC assembled carbine with contracted and/or overhauled parts complete with all accessories to current standards at time of build; will work with H or H2 and could have shipped with either. Units will balance buffer to ammo requirements: ** H okay with M193/M855. (All shipboard MK 18s should have H buffers as this was the standard at the time of assembly.) ** H2 needed for MK 262/R2LP and will run M193/M855. ** H3 may be needed for an extreme cases or when the gas port is eroded but the barrel still groups. * MK18 type 2: Colt-contracted carbine complete with all accessories (H buffer supplied). Units will balance buffer to ammo requirements same as Mk 18 type 1. * MK18 Mod 1: Similar to the changes found in the SOPMOD Block II kit, the Mod 1 features a gas block end without a front sight and a railed handguard, by Daniel Defense, that extends all the way to the base of the flash hider to provide more accessory rail space for the user. * MK18 Mod 2: Simultaneously with USASOC's adoption of the Upper Receiver Group, Improved (URG-I), which featured the Geissele Automatic's MK16 rail with M-Lok interface, Special Operations community had requested Geissele to develop a 9.3-inch rail for their MK18's. In 2019, there were requirements for a 10.5-inch rail instead, because reevaluation found 11.5-inch barrels to work better than 10.3-inch series, and thus a longer rail is needed. Together with the regular 14.5-inch uppers, these are often unofficially dubbed \\"SOPMOD Block 3\\" by operators. Specifications CQBR carbine used during a Navy Rifle Qualification Course. Navy SEALs conduct Shoot House Training at Little Creek, Virginia in mid 2007. Each Mk18 Mod 0 CQBR carbines has the M68 Aimpoint optic, Knight's Armament QD suppressor and AN/PEQ-2. *Upper and lower receivers: The lower receiver is a standard M4A1 lower receiver sometimes modified with the addition of a CQD RSM sling adapter plate. However, many CQBR rifles also use surplus M16A1 lower receivers. Internally, the CQBR also takes advantage of a larger gas port and modified bolt carrier and buffer assembly. The gas port has been opened to 0.070 in (1.8 mm). A number of Lewis Machine & Tool 10.5\\" (266.7 mm) upper receivers have also been reported to have been purchased for the CQBR program. These upper receivers feature a gas system optimized for short barrel use. The Mod 1 makes use of a forward sight delete and full-length handguard to provide more rail space for the user. *Sights: Initially, detachable carrying handles cut down so that only the rear sight assembly was used. However, most of these have been replaced with the similar, commercially-made Lewis Machine & Tool adjustable rear sight. Also used are several types of reflex and magnified optics, most commonly seen is the Aimpoint CompM2 in a Wilcox Industries Corp. Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) mount. On the Mod 1, the front sight is deleted and a full-length accessory rail is used; flip up iron sights may be mounted per user preferences *Stock: A variety of M4 retractable buttstocks are used on a standard 4-position receiver extension, including the standard \\"CAR\\" stock. Most often seen is the SOPMOD stock, often referred to as the \\"Crane stock\\", created by Dave Armstrong of NSWC-Crane. The angled stock offers better cheekweld as well as providing two storage compartments for spare batteries. The stock must be removed from the weapon to access the storage compartments. The initial run of stocks was made by NSWC-Crane from glass fiber polymer. Because of this, they were somewhat fragile and did not always properly lock into the receiver extension. A rubber band was used to secure the latch so it would not slide out of the desired position. The current L7LA2B SOPMOD stocks are made by Lewis Machine & Tools and have none of these problems. *Barrel: The CQBR uses a 1:7 in (178 mm) twist M4 barrel that has been modified in length to 10.3 in (262 mm). The diameter of the barrel under the handguards is 1.17 in (29.7 mm). The KAC M4-QD flash suppressor is fitted, allowing use of the KAC QDSS-NT4 suppressor (National Stock Number 1005-01-437-0324). Although it has a bayonet lug, the CQBR is not meant to be fitted with a bayonet. *Handguards: The standard handguard for the CQBR is the Knight's Armament Company Rail Interface System (M4 Carbine RIS; National Stock Number 1005-01-416-1089), which is designed for a variety of barrel profiles and allows for the use of any MIL-STD-1913 tactical accessories such as the AN/PEQ-2 infrared pointer, SureFire flashlights, or a vertical forward grip. The handguard manufacturer has since changed from KAC to Daniel Defense as the primary contractor for the MK18 RIS, NSN # 1005-01-548-1385. *Ammunition: The CQBR is designed to use standard 5.56√ó45mm NATO 62-grain SS109/M855 FMJ and M856 Tracer ammunition. However, due to the short barrel, the heavier 77-grain Mk 262 cartridge is preferred. There are no plans to rechamber the weapon in any additional calibers. CQBR modified to individual tastes being fired full- auto. This particular firearm has the Surefire Warden blast diffuser and the Aimpoint Micro T-2 red-dot sight.

The drain into the underground cistern is visible. The impluvium is the sunken part of the atrium in a Greek or Roman house (domus). Designed to carry away the rainwater coming through the compluvium of the roof, it is usually made of marble and placed about 30 cm below the floor of the atrium and emptied into a subfloor cistern.John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, The World of Pompeii, Routledge Press, 2007, Construction and use Rain falling through a compluvium in a modern lavoir. Inspection (without excavation) of impluvia in Paestum, Pompeii and Rome indicated that the pavement surface in the impluvia was porous, or that the non-porous stone tiles were separated by gaps significant enough to allow a substantial quantity of water caught in the basin of the impluvium to filter through the cracks and, beyond, through layers of gravel and sand into a holding chamber below ground. A circular stone opening protected with a puteal (easily visible in one photograph, resembling a chimney pot) allows easy access by bucket and rope to this private, filtered and naturally cooled water supply. Similar water supplies were found elsewhere in the public spaces of the city, with their stone puteals showing the wear patterns of much use (the rope wear patterns also are visible in the photograph). In wet seasons, excess water that could not pass through the filter would overflow the basin and exit the building, and any sediment or debris remaining in the surface basin could be swept away. In hot weather, water could be drawn from the cistern chamber (or fetched by slaves from supplies outside the domus) and cast into the shallow pool to evaporate and provide a cooling effect to the entire atrium: as the water evaporated, air drawn in through the compluvium was cooled and moved throughout the house to cool the surrounding living spaces, a form of passive cooling. The combination of compluvium and impluvium formed an ingenious, effective and attractive manner of collecting, filtering and cooling rainwater.

WPEP's format had been full-service, offering local news and talk programming, as well as music and nationally syndicated talk. The station was last owned by the Anastos Media Group. History=1940s In late 1948, Silver City Broadcasting Corp., owned by businessman John McGregor, applied for and was granted a construction permit for an AM broadcast station in Taunton. The station's callsign was originally to be WTRN, however the callsign was changed to WPEP before the station officially signed on the air December 22, 1949. When WPEP signed on, its studio was located atop the Roseland Ballroom, north of downtown Taunton. The original format is believed to have been all local programming. WPEP was a 1-kilowatt daytime-only station from 1949 to 1970. This meant that WPEP was required to cease transmitting from sunset to sunrise. WPEP's transmitter site was 760 County Street in Taunton, Massachusetts. 1970s On November 27, 1970, WPEP received pre-sunrise authority, allowing it to sign on at 06:00 local time with a power of 350 watts, which could be upped to the full kilowatt at sunrise (during months when sunrise occurs later than 06:00). News Director: John P. Shaw 1980s Daytime-only status lasted until September 1, 1986 when WPEP was granted nighttime authorization, which allowed WPEP to transmit 227.4 watts of power. 1990s WPEP was sold in 1997 by Silver City Broadcasting to J. Keating Willcox's Willow Farm Broadcasting. 2000s This would be the final calendar decade of WPEP's existence. WPEP was sold to Anastos Media Group in 2001. Paul Giammarco was named general manager in 2002 until he left for WSAR in 2003. After Giammarco left, staffer A.J. Nicholson was promoted to general manager. In 2004, WPEP added the Boston Red Sox Radio Network & carried the team's first World Series victory heard on radio. It was an affiliate in 2005 as well but station management had changed that March & didn't air games. A May 5, 2005 article in the Taunton Daily Gazette said that the station was in jeopardy because WNSH in Beverly, Massachusetts got approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to increase their daytime power. WNSH was owned by former WPEP owner J. Keating Wilcox. When Wilcox sold WPEP to Anastos Media, there was an informal agreement that Anastos Media would turn in the station's license to allow WNSH (on the same frequency) to up their power, contingent on the power increase being granted by the FCC. The city's mayor and U.S. Representative filed objections; however, the station's general manager at the time publicly dismissed the possibility the station may go dark. On December 2, 2005, Anastos Media filed a renewal of the WPEP license. The renewal was granted by the FCC on March 28, 2006. WPEP's license was turned in to the FCC on October 18, 2007.

It was originally spoken in a cluster of villages in Siirt Province in southeastern Turkey. Speakers of H√©rtevin Aramaic have emigrated mostly to the West, and are now scattered and isolated from one another. A few speakers remain in Turkey. Origins H√©rtevin was 'discovered' by linguist Otto Jastrow in 1970, and first described in publication by him two years later. His recordings of the language are available on Heidelberg University's Semitic Sound Archive. The speakers of the H√©rtevin dialect of Neo-Aramaic are traditionally Chaldean Catholics. Their area of habitation in and around the village of Hertevin (called Hertevinler in Turkish and H√§rt…ôv…ôn in Kurdish), near the town of Pervari in Siirt Province is at the very northeastern extreme of the area where Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages were traditionally spoken. Thus, H√©rtevin is a peripheral dialect that has developed quite differently from related languages. All H√©rtevin speakers are bilingual in Kurdish, and many also speak other languages. The Syriac alphabet is used for writing, but almost no literature in the H√©rtevin dialect exists. Church liturgy is in Syriac. Phonology Its major phonetic feature is the loss of the voiceless velar fricative x, which has become a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, ƒß. The original voiceless pharyngeal fricative has retained that pronunciation. In all the other dialects of eastern Neo-Aramaic the opposite is true: the voiceless pharyngeal fricative has been lost and merged with the voiceless velar fricative. Another feature of H√©rtevin Neo-Aramaic is its set of demonstratives. As with other languages of the eastern group, H√©rtevin makes no distinction between 'this' and 'that', and uses a single set of pronouns to cover both meanings: ƒÅwa (m. sg.), ƒÅya (f. sg.) and ƒÅni (pl.). However, unlike the other languages, H√©rtevin has developed an emphatic form of these pronouns that indicates 'this one right here': ≈çhƒÅ, ƒìhƒÅ and anhƒ´. Although belonging to the eastern, or northeastern, group of Neo-Aramaic dialects, H√©rtevin shares some features with the Turoyo language, of the central group, originating from nearby Mardin Province.

This theory serves as an alternative approach to maturational theories such as the model proposed by Jean Piaget concerning intellectual and learning development.  Theory  American psychologist Robert M. Gagne first introduced cumulative learning theory in 1968 with the proposition that intellectual skills can be broken down into simpler skills. He cited how new learning depends on the combination of acquired and recalled learned entities. In a later explanation, Gagne stated that \\"there is a specifiable minimal prerequisite for each new learning task,\\" and that if the learner cannot recall this capability, learning a new task is not possible. According to Gagne, the cumulative learning theory is better than the maturational model because of the focus on the hierarchies of capabilities. In this framework, instead of the content and concepts of the task, the learning hierarchies address intellectual skills and strategies. He demonstrated this in the case of children's performance on conservation tasks over time. A criticism cites that cumulative learning theory is inadequate as a general theory of mental development because it is not sufficiently developed in such a way that it permits empirical tests of it.  Application  A very simple example is the saying 'you can't run before you can walk'; the procedural memory built while learning to walk is necessary before one can start to learn to run. Pronouncing words is impossible without first learning to pronounce the vowels and consonants that make them up (hence babies' babbling). This is an essential cognitive capacity, allowing prior development to produce new foundations for further cognitive development. Cumulative learning consolidates the knowledge one has obtained through experiences, allowing it to be reproduced and exploited for subsequent learning situations through cumulative interaction between prior knowledge and new information. Arguably, all learning is cumulative learning, as all learning depends on previous learningRichey, Rita C. \\"The future role of Robert M. Gagne in instructional design.\\" The Legacy of Robert M.

It is based primarily on the 538-line Middle English poem Sir Landevale, which in turn was based on Marie de France's lai Lanval, written in a form of French understood in the courts of both England and France in the 12th century. Sir Launfal retains the basic story told by Marie and retold in Sir Landevale, augmented with material from an Old French lai Graelent and a lost romance that possibly featured a giant named Sir Valentyne. This is in line with Thomas Chestre's eclectic way of creating his poetry.Mills, M, 1969. Lybeaus Desconus, from the Medieval manuscripts Lambeth Palace MS 306 and British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A.ii. Published for the Early English Text Society by Oxford University Press. p 35. In the tale, Sir Launfal is propelled from wealth and status - the steward at King Arthur's court - to being a pauper and a social outcast. He is not even invited to a feast in his home town of Caerleon when the king visits, although Arthur knows nothing of this. Out in the forest alone, he meets with two damsels who take him to their mistress, the daughter of the King of Faerie. She gives him untold wealth and a magic bag in which money can always be found, on the condition that he becomes her lover. She will visit him whenever he wants and nobody will see her or hear her. But he must tell nobody about her, or her love will vanish at that instant. The story of a powerful (fairy) woman who takes a lover on condition that he obey a particular prohibition is common in medieval poetry: the French lais of Desir√©, Graelent, and Guingamor, and Chr√©tien de Troyes's romance Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, all share similar plot elements. The presence of a Land of Faerie, or an Otherworld, betrays the story's Celtic roots. A final court scene may be intended by Chestre as criticism of the contemporary legal and judicial framework in late-14th-century England. The equation of money with worth in the tale may satirize a late-14th-century mentality. Manuscripts Sir Launfal survives in a single manuscript copy: *British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A.ii., mid-15th century. The Middle English poem itself dates to the late-14th century,Laskaya, Anne and Salisbury, Eve (Eds). 1995.

Unusually for a Middle English romance, the poem's author can be named. The final stanza includes the lines: :\\"Thomas Chestre made thys tale :Of the noble knyght Syr Launfale, :Good of chyvalrye.\\"Laskaya, Anne and Salisbury, Eve (Eds). 1995.

Lybeaus Desconus, from the Medieval manuscripts Lambeth Palace MS 306 and British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A.ii. Published for the Early English Text Society by Oxford University Press. p 34. Plot Sir Launfal participates in the chivalric tradition of gift-giving to such an extent that he is made King Arthur's steward, in charge of celebrations. After ten happy years under Launfal's stewardship, however, King Arthur's court is graced by a new arrival, Guenevere, whom Merlin has brought from Ireland. Launfal takes a dislike to this new lady, as do many other worthy knights, because of her reputation for promiscuity. King Arthur marries Guenevere and Launfal's fortunes take a sudden turn for the worse. He leaves King Arthur's court when Guenevere shows ill will to him by not giving him a gift at the wedding. Insulted and humiliated, Launfal leaves the court, losing his status and income. Returning to his home town of Caerleon (now a village in South Wales, where the ruins of the Roman fortress of Isca can still be seen, whose walls surrounding its Roman baths and elsewhere were still standing high during the medieval period).Zienkeiwicz, J. D. 1986. The Legionary Fortress Baths at Caerleon (2 vols). National Museums and Galleries of Wales. Launfal takes humble lodgings, spends all the money that King Arthur gave him before setting out, and soon descends into poverty and debt. One Trinity Sunday, the king holds a banquet in Caerleon to which Launfal, because of his poverty, is not invited. The mayor's daughter offers to let him spend the day with her, but he declines her offer since he has nothing to wear. Instead, he borrows a horse from her and goes for a ride, stopping to rest under a tree in a nearby forest. Two maidens appear and bring him to a lady they call Tryamour, daughter of the King of Olyroun and of Fayrye, whom Launfal finds lying on a bed in a glorious pavilion. :\\"He fond yn the pavyloun / The kynges doughter of Olyroun, / Dame Tryamour that hyghte; :Her fadyr was kyng of Fayrye, / Of Occient, fer and nyghe, / A man of mochell myghte. :In the pavyloun he fond a bed of prys / Yheled wyth purpur bys, / That semyle was of syghte. :Therinne lay that lady gent / That after Syr Launfal hedde ysent / That lefsom lemede bryght.\\"Laskaya, Anne and Salisbury, Eve (Eds). 1995. Middle English text of \\"Sir Launfal\\", lines 277-88. (He found in the pavilion the daughter of the King of Olyroun, her name was Tryamour and her father was the King of the Otherworld - of the west, Following: Laskaya, Anne and Salisbury, Eve (Eds). 1995. Middle English text of \\"Sir Launfal\\", note to line 281. Occient may mean 'west' or 'ocean'. both near and far - a very powerful man. In the tent was a lavishly-adorned and very handsome bed. Lying in it was the beautiful woman who had summoned him.) Tryamour offers Launfal her love and several material gifts: an invisible servant, Gyfre; a horse, Blaunchard; and a bag that will always produce gold coins however many are taken from it, all on the condition that he keeps their relationship a secret from the rest of the world. No one must know of her existence. She tells him she will come to him whenever he is all alone and wishes for her. Launfal returns to Caerleon. Soon a train of packhorses arrives, bearing all kinds of valuables for him. He uses this new wealth to perform many acts of charity. He also wins in a local tournament, thanks to the horse and banner given him by the lady. A knight of Lombardy, Sir Valentyne, challenges him (on the honour of his beloved lady) to come to Lombardy to fight with him. This section of Thomas Chestre's tale does not derive from Marie de France's Lanval or from the English Sir Landevale, but perhaps from another romance that is now lost. Launfal makes the voyage, and defeats Valentyne, thanks to his invisible servant Gyfre, who picks up his helmet and shield when Valentyne knocks them down. Launfal kills Valentyne and then has to kill many more of the Lombard knights in order to get away. Launfal's reputation for martial prowess and generosity reaches new heights and word at last reaches King Arthur. Launfal is summoned again by the king, after a long absence, and asked to serve as steward for a long festival beginning at the Feast of St. John. During some revelry at the court, Guenevere offers herself to Launfal. Launfal refuses, Guenevere threatens to ruin his reputation in retaliation by questioning his manhood and Launfal blurts out in his defence that he has a mistress whose ugliest handmaiden would make a better Queen than Guenevere. Guenevere goes to Arthur and accuses Launfal of trying to seduce her and of insulting her as well. Knights are sent to arrest him. Launfal has gone to his room, but his faerie mistress does not appear and Sir Launfal soon realises why. Tryamour will no longer come to him when he wishes for her since he has given away her existence. Soon, her gifts have disappeared or changed. Now he is brought to trial. Since the jury of his peers all know that the Queen is more likely to have propositioned Launfal than the other way around, they believe Launfal's version of the encounter. However, for his insult he is given a year and a fortnight to produce the beautiful lady as proof of his boast; Guenevere says she is willing to be blinded if he manages to produce such a woman. As the day of the proof progresses, the Queen presses for him to be executed while others express doubt, particularly when two parties of gorgeous women ride up. Finally Tryamour arrives and exculpates Launfal on both counts. She breathes on Guenevere and blinds her. Gyfre, now visible, brings his horse Blaunchard, and Tryamour, Launfal, and her ladies ride away to the island of Olyroun, which in Marie's 12th-century version of the tale is Avalon.Burgess, Glyn S., and Busby, Keith, 1986. The Lais of Marie de France. Penguin Books Limited. Lanval, p 81. Once a year, on a certain day, Launfal returns and his horse may be heard neighing and a knight may joust with him, although he was never seen again in Arthur's land. Geography In this story, Arthur is king of England (also referred to as Bretayn) and holds court in Carlisle and Glastonbury, particularly during such summer feasts as Pentecost and Trinity Sunday. There is ambiguity, though. Kardevyle, where the opening scene of the story takes place, can be interpreted as Carlisle, in northern England,Laskaya, Anne and Salisbury, Eve (Eds). 1995. Middle English text of Sir Launfal, note to line 7. \\"Kardevyle : Carlisle as a place associated with Arthuriana is rendered Kaer-dubalum in Geoffrey of Monmouth (c.1136).\\" where King Arthur holds court in many Middle English romances, such as the Awntyrs off Arthure and The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle. But it can also be interpreted as Cardiff, in South Wales,Shepherd, Stephen H. A., 1995, regards Cardiff as the most likely intention, given Chestre's spelling, p 190. This interpretation is followed by James Weldon in his prose translation of Sir Launfal which is King Arthur's residence in Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, and might sit more comfortably with the other locations in Sir Launfal, such as Caerleon and Glastonbury. Marie de France's poem Lanval, along with other Old French Arthurian works,Bryant, Nigel, 1978, revised edition 2007. The High Book of the Grail. A translation from Old French into Modern English of the thirteenth century romance Perlesvaus. D S Brewer, an imprint of Boydell and Brewer Limited. \\"King Arthur was at Cardueil one Ascension Day\\", page 3. has this city as \\"Kardoel\\",Burgess, Glyn S., and Busby, Keith, 1986. The Lais of Marie de France. Penguin Books Limited. Lanval, text of the original Old French poem, line 5: \\"A Kardoel surjurnot li reis\\", p 139. which, given the confusion, must have sounded, even to a late-Medieval English ear, like a conflation of Carlisle and Cardiff. In Marie's poem, however, the intention seems clearly to be Carlisle, since King Arthur is fighting against Scots and Pictish incursions there. Guenevere (Gwennere, Gwenore) is stated by Thomas Chestre to be from \\"Irlond\\", possibly Ireland, the daughter of King Rion, who is an enemy of King Arthur in most other medieval Arthurian stories and usually hails from North Wales.Laskaya, Anne and Salisbury, Eve (Eds). 1995. Middle English text of Sir Launfal, note to line 40. Launfal's home base seems to be Caerleon, in South Wales. The realm of Fayrye is located on the island of Olyroun (probably Ol√©ron, near Brittany). Being the realm of Fayrye, however, it might not be expected to have a specific location in the real world. Marie de France relates that Lanval was taken by his Fa√´rie lover to Avalon, \\"a very beautiful island,\\" and was never seen again; just as Connla was taken by a daughter of the Irish god Manannan to a land across the sea that \\"delights the mind of everyone who turns to me\\", in an ancient Irish legend.Gregory, Lady A., 1904.

Also mentioned are knights of Little Britain (Brittany), and the need to cross the salt sea to reach Lombardy. Arthurian legend=Evolution Marie de France's lai was composed at a time when the story of King Arthur was not fully developed, and probably before the story of the love between Lancelot and Queen Guinevere had been added to it by Chr√©tien de Troyes in his Knight of the Cart. Thomas Chestre describes a 10-year period during which Launfal prospers at Arthur's bachelor court, followed by Arthur's marriage to Guinevere. In the 13th-century French Arthurian romances, Merlin warns against this marriage;Vinaver, Eugene, 1971. Malory: Works. Oxford University Press.

Malory takes his version from the thirteenth century La Suite du Merlin. in Chestre's poem, he arranges it, betraying Chestre's willingness to adapt an established legend in his own way. Such adaptation is further evident in Guinevere's blinding. Marie de France describes no such mutilation of the Queen, and it sits uncomfortably with the climax of King Arthur's reign, well- known from the 13th-century Lancelot-Grail Cycle, in which Lancelot and a seeing Guinevere play their part in King Arthur's final days.Benson, Larry D (Ed), revised by Foster, Edward E (Ed), 1994. King Arthur's Death: The Middle English Stanzaic Morte Arthur and Alliterative Morte Arthure, Kalamazoo, Michigan: Western Michigan University for TEAMS. This climax to King Arthur's legend is recorded in Middle English verse in the Stanzaic Morte Arthur from British Library MS Harley 2252 of c. 1390. Stanzaic Morte Arthur TEAMS Middle English text with introduction. Lanval and Sir Launfal Many passages of Chestre's poem follow Marie de France's Lanval line by line (probably via the earlier English romance). However, he adds or changes scenes and characters, sometimes working in material from other sources, and makes explicit and concrete many motivations and other aspects of the story which Marie leaves undiscussed‚Äîfor example, the fairy purse and other gifts, such as the horse Blaunchard and the invisible servant Gyfre, who both depart when he breaks his promise not to boast. Some of these additional elements are derived from an Old French lai of Graelent, itself borrowing from Marie's Lanval.Burgess, Glyn S., and Busby, Keith, 1986. The Lais of Marie de France. Translated from Old French with an introduction. Penguin Books Limited. Introduction, p 9.On plot changes in this and later versions, see Colette St√©vanovitch, \\"Enquiries into the Textual History of the Seventeenth-Century Sir Lambewell\\", in Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England, eds. Leo Carruthers, Raeleen Chai-Elsholz, Tatjana Silec. New York: Palgrave, 2011. 193-204. In Marie's Old French version of the story, Guinevere is not involved in Lanval's initial departure from King Arthur's court, and he is simply a poor knight who has been overlooked by the king, not an over-generous knight vulnerable to getting into debt.Burgess, Glyn S., and Busby, Keith, 1986. The Lais of Marie de France. Penguin Books Limited. Lanval. \\"He was the son of a king of noble birth, but far from his inheritance, and although he belonged to Arthur's household he had spent all his wealth, for the king gave him nothing and Lanval asked for nothing.\\" p 72. Arthur generally comes off much better in Sir Launfal than in Lanval, and Guenevere much worse; she is promoted to a major character, with more speeches and actions, and her comeuppance is the climax of the poem. Chestre also adds the Mayor of Caerleon, a character who is not present in Lanval and whose grudging disloyalty gives extra gloss to the generosity which Launfal shows when he obtains the fairy purse. Chestre adds two tournament scenes that are not present in Marie's lai, allowing him to show off his ability to fashion them and also changing the emphasis on his hero's character. He also introduces Sir Valentyne, possibly from a lost romance. Sir Valantyne is a giant whom the hero is required to defeat, as is so common in medieval romance. In fact, the poem is close to becoming a romance, recounting many years of Launfal's life - ten before King Arthur's marriage, then seven with his Otherworldly lady and a further year before his trial - in contrast to Marie's Lanval which concerns a single episode in the hero's life, like most of her other lais.Burgess, Glyn S., and Busby, Keith, 1986. The Lais of Marie de France. Penguin Books Limited. Lanval. Lanval meets his Faerie lover near the opening of the story and is propositioned by Guinevere: \\"In the same year, I believe, after St John's day...\\" p 78. His trial takes place soon afterwards, as soon as the king's noblemen can be assembled to hear the case. In general, Lanval is a story about love, whereas Sir Launfal is much more an adventure story which includes a love element. Motifs=Breton Elements of Sir Launfal that borrow from Marie de France's Lanval can be found in other Breton lais as well, particularly the land of \\"Fayerye\\". Marie de France's Yonec, for example, describes a woman following a trail of blood left by her lover; a man who was accustomed to arriving at the window of her room in the form of a hawk. She follows the trail of blood into the side of a hill and out into an Otherworld where all the buildings are made of solid silver, into a town where ships are moored.Burgess, Glyn S., and Busby, Keith, 1986. The Lais of Marie de France. Penguin Books Limited. Yonec, pp 86-93. Marie's lai Guigemar, sees the wounded hero set sail in a mysterious boat with candelabra at its prow and with only a bed on deck, upon which he lies, the only living soul on board.Burgess, Glyn S., and Busby, Keith, 1986. The Lais of Marie de France. Penguin Books Limited. Guigemar, pp 43-55. He arrives safely at the mysterious castle of a lady who heals him of his wound, and becomes her lover. Sir Orfeo follows a company of ladies into the side of a cliff and through the rock until he emerges into an Otherworld, in a Middle English Breton lai, where he rescues his wife who had been abducted, from amongst those who have been beheaded and burnt and suffocated.Laskaya, Anne, and Salisbury, Eve (Eds), 1995. The Middle English Breton Lays, Kalamazoo, Michigan: Western Michigan University for TEAMS. Many ancient Irish tales involve a hero entering a hill of the Sidhe, or crossing a sea to a Land of Youth, or passing down through the waters of a lake into an Otherworld.Rolleston, Thomas, 1911. Myths of the Celtic Race. The Gresham Publishing Company. (Reprinted 1998. Myths and Legends of the Celts. Senate, an imprint of Tiger Books International plc). A Middle English poem, the Isle of Ladies, describes an island where magic apples sustain a multitude of ladies, and only ladies, on an island that is made of glass;Pearsall, Derek (Ed), 1990. The Floure and the Leafe; The Assembly of Ladies; The Isle of Ladies, Kalamazoo, Michigan: Western Michigan University for TEAMS.

Leo Carruthers, Raeleen Chai-Elsholz, Tatjana Silec. New York: Palgrave, 2011. 175-91. Folktale Folktale elements inherited from Marie de France's Lanval include the fairy lover, magical gifts, a beauty contest and an offended fay. Sir Launfal adds a number of folktale elements of its own to those inherited from Marie de France's Lanval, including those of a spendthrift knight, combat with a giant, a magical dwarf-servant and \\"the cyclical return of the mounted warrior's spirit to this world once a year.\\" Contemporary (medieval) social commentaryWealth over worth= In a number of ways, Sir Launfal may give literary expression to some contemporary 14th-century concerns as well. Its depiction of a court and a kingdom where wealth is the only measure of standing and social worth, may be a satire on a bourgeois mentality in late-14th-century England.Spearing, A C, 1993. The Medieval Poet as Voyeur: Looking and Listening in Medieval Love-Narratives. Cambridge University Press, pp 97-119. A knight who, through his own generosity, falls into debt and poverty, and consequent misery, is depicted in at least two other late medieval Middle English works, Sir Amadace,Tuma, George W. and Hazell, Dinah (Eds). 2009. \\"Harken to Me\\" Middle English Romances in Translation. Medieval Forum Special Edition. Sir Amadace Translation in Modern English with a Commentary. and Sir Cleges.Laura A. Hibbard, 1963. Medieval Romance in England. New York Burt Franklin, p 79. =Justice= Launfal's breaking of his word not to reveal his lover's name may have contemporary medieval significance, since one of the tenets of Courtly love was \\"the code of avantance, in which the male was to protect his lover‚Äôs reputation by not revealing her identity.\\" But there may be much wider concerns expressed in Sir Launfal about legal process and the state of justice in England near the end of the 14th century. \\"Literary depictions of the king‚Äôs judicial failure, as in Sir Launfal, comment on the entire system.\\" In Thomas Chestre's poem, Queen Guinevere destabilizes the court by taking favourites and falsely accusing those who cross her, the king seems more willing to placate her than to see justice done and at least some of his noblemen are more concerned to see their king's desires blindly carried out than to see a fair outcome. There was undoubtedly dissatisfaction in some quarters with the legal system in England at this time.Ackroyd, Peter, 2004. Chaucer. Chatto and Windus. Republished 2005: Vintage, an imprint of Random House. Marie de France's depiction of King Arthur's court in Lanval, two hundred years earlier, may have been intended to parody the court of King Henry II of England, who saw himself as a new Arthur.Hazell, Dinah, 2003.

History  Screenshot of the Hula log-on screen Hula was an open-source effort sponsored by Novell and developed by Dave Camp and Joe Gasiorek, amongst others. Hula was derived from an existing product by the same software house, called NetMail, and retained many of the architectural features of that software. However, important components such as the mail store were intended to be re-developed to integrate new functionality (such as search) and new features (such as calendaring, using the calendar server protocol CalDAV). Hula aimed to expand in three main directions: # A calendaring tool # A web-based rich mail client # A search facility for all mail and calendar information within the server It came with a web-based client to access information, but desktop applications were intended to be readily supported. Novell Evolution released with Hula support in version 2.6, and other clients were expected to support Hula closer to Hula's release. On November 28, 2006, Novell announced that it would no longer have anyone work on it full-time. On January 30, 2007, The Messaging Architects announced an agreement to acquire NetMail and take over leadership of the open source Hula Project from Novell. Since late 2007, the Hula project website has been down. Before it disappeared, it announced the transfer, due to the move of Hula from Novell to The Messaging Architects. With the future of Hula unclear to many, a software fork of the source code was used to create the independent Bongo Project. Activity on this fork also seems to have been abandoned.

Irnerius (c. 1050 - after 1125), sometimes referred to as lucerna juris (\\"lantern of the law\\"), was an Italian jurist, and founder of the School of Glossators and thus of the tradition of Medieval Roman Law. He taught the newly recovered Roman lawcode of Justinian I, the Corpus Juris Civilis, among the liberal arts at the University of Bologna, his native city. The recovery and revival of Roman law, taught first at Bologna in the 1070s, was a momentous event in European cultural history. Irnerius' interlinear glosses on the Corpus Juris Civilis stand at the beginnings of a European law that was written, systematic, comprehensive and rational, and based on Roman law. Life He was born in Bologna about 1050. At the urging of Countess Matilda of Tuscany he began to devote himself to the study of jurisprudence, taking the Justinian code as a guide. After teaching jurisprudence for a short while in Rome he returned to Bologna, where he founded a new school of jurisprudence in 1084 or 1088, which would rival the law school of Ravenna. Some jurisprudence had been taught at Bologna, before Irnerius founded his school, by Pepo and a few others, and a tradition of jurisprudence had developed at Pavia since the mid-ninth century.The emergent role of Pavia put forward by Charles M. Radding, The Origins of Medieval Jurisprudence: Pavia and Bologna, 850‚Äì1150(Yale University Press, 1988) was considered to be overstated by most reviewers. He introduced the custom of explaining the Roman law by means of glosses, which originally were meagre interlinear elucidations of the text. But since the glosses were often too extensive to be inserted between the lines of the text, he began to write them on the margin of the page, thus being the first to introduce the marginal glosses which afterwards came into general use. Decretals with Glossa ordinaria After the death of Pope Paschal II, he defended the rights of Emperor Henry V in the papal election and upheld the legality of the election of the imperial antipope Gregory VIII. After 1116 he appears to have held some office under the emperor. He died, perhaps during the reign of the emperor Lothair II, but certainly before 1140. Teaching Irnerius taught along lines firmly established in the teaching of Scripture, by reading aloud a section of the civil law, which the students would copy, and add to the text his commentary and explanatory glosses. Thus he was the first of the glossators, whose explications of the law became an essential part of the legal curriculum. The text of Justinian's Pandects used in Bologna, referred to as the Littera Bononiensis, closely parallel to the Littera Florentina, would be disseminated throughout Europe as students returned home from Bologna: there are versions of the Bolognese Littera with provenances in Paris, Padua, Leipzig and at the Vatican (Purpura 2001). Works Glossae ad Digestum vetus, 12th-century manuscript. Padua, Biblioteca Universitaria di Padova, Fondo manoscritti, ms. 941, ff. 1-198. According to ancient opinion (which, however, has been much controverted), Irnerius was the author of the epitome of the Novellae of Justinian, called the Authentica, arranged according to the titles of the Code. His Formularium tabellionum (a directory for notaries) and Quaestiones (a book of judicial decisions) are no longer extant. The Summa Codicis, attributed to Irnerius by Herman Fitting in his 1894 edition Fitting, Summa Codicis des Irnerius, mit einer Einleitung (Berlin, 1894) is now widely considered a later work of between 1130 and 1159, but remains the earliest known summa on Justinian's Code Lange, R√≥misches Recht im Mittelalter I (Munich, 1997), pp. 403-405. Another important work, Quaestiones de juris subtilitatibus,Fitting, \\"Quaestiones de juris subtilitatibus des Irnerius, mit einer Einleitung\\" in Festschrift zum 200j√§hrigern Jubil√§um der Universitat Halle-Wittenberg, 1894. was generally ascribed to Irnerius until Hermann Kantorowicz published a manuscript from the British Museum.Kantorowicz with W.W. Buckland, Studies in the Glossators of the Roman Law: Newly Discovered Writings of the Twelfth Century (New York, 1939) reassigned Quaestiones de juris subtilitatibus to Placentinus. Other juridical works and glosses that are ascribed to Irnerius are extant only in fragments, or their authorship is uncertain. Reputation Irnerius was largely forgotten until his name was revived by German historians of the later 19th century and came to prominence with the celebrations marking the octocentennial of the University of Bologna.F. W. Maitland, reviewing Enrico Besta, ed. L'Opera del' Irnerio, vols I and II (Turin, 1896) in The English Historical Review 13 No. 49 (January 1898:143f). His name is also seen in manuscripts as Hirnerius, Hyrnerius, Iernerius, Gernerius, Garnerius, Guarnerius, Warnerius, Wernerius, Yrnerius. He called himself Wernerius when he signed documents. Anders WinrothAnders Winroth, The Making of Gratian's Decretum (Cambridge, 2000) has questioned much of the received account of Irnerius' life as well as his importance to the history of Roman law in the Middle Ages.

It is the antimony endmember of the continuous solid solution series with arsenic- bearing tennantite. Pure endmembers of the series are seldom if ever seen in nature. Of the two, the antimony rich phase is more common. Other elements also substitute in the structure, most notably iron and zinc, along with less common silver, mercury and lead. Bismuth also substitutes for the antimony site and bismuthian tetrahedrite or annivite is a recognized variety. The related, silver dominant, mineral species freibergite, although rare, is notable in that it can contain up to 18% silver. Tetrahedrite gets its name from the distinctive tetrahedron shaped cubic crystals. The mineral usually occurs in massive form, it is a steel gray to black metallic mineral with Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4 and specific gravity of 4.6 to 5.2. It occurs in low to moderate temperature hydrothermal veins and in some contact metamorphic deposits. It is a minor ore of copper and associated metals. It was first described in 1845 for occurrences in Freiberg, Saxony, Germany.  Applications  California-based Alphabet Energy announced plans to offer a thermoelectric device based on tetrahedrite to turn heat into electricity. The company claimed that other thermoelectrics typically produce about 2.5 percent efficiency, while tetrahedrite could achieve 5 to 10 percent.

It is situated on the northwestern coast of the largest Danish island, Zealand (or Sj√¶lland in Danish), on the opposite, eastern side of which lies the capital Copenhagen, away. Kalundborg is famous as the location of a large broadcasting facility, the Kalundborg transmitter. The city is also home to the largest coal-fired power station in Denmark. Kalundborg is a mainly trading and industrial town, but is also well known for the beautiful five-spired Church of Our Lady, which is closely associated with King Valdemar I and the famous Archbishop Absalon. The church itself is said to have been built by Absalon's brother, Esbern Snare. Kalundborg is also the traditional seat of the aristocratic Lerche family. Their stately home, Lerchenborg, the best example of rococo architecture in Denmark, can be seen in the town's outskirts. Ferries connect Kalundborg westward to the island of Sams√∏. Geography Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg, Denmark. Kalundborg is at latitude 55¬∞41‚Ä≤N, longitude 11¬∞6‚Ä≤E, about west of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand (Sjaelland). History The Kalundborg area was first settled in 1170 at a natural harbour at the head of the narrow bay today known as Kalundborg Fjord. It became more urbanized during the nineteenth century and had grown into a major industrial centre by the mid-twentieth century. Kalundborg Municipality has approximately 20,000 inhabitants, and its network is the most published example of Industrial Symbiosis. The history of Kalundborg Industrial Symbiosis activities began in 1961 when a project was developed and implemented to use surface water from Lake Tisso for a new oil refinery, to save the limited supplies of ground water. The City of Kalundborg took the responsibility for building the pipeline while the refinery financed it. Starting from this initial collaboration, a number of other collaborative projects were subsequently introduced and the number of partners gradually increased. By the end of the 1980s, the partners realised that they had effectively \\"self-organised\\" into what is probably the best-known example of Industrial Symbiosis. The material exchanges in the Kalundborg region include: conservation of natural and financial resources; reduction in production, material, energy, insurance and treatment costs and liabilities; improved operating efficiency; quality control; improved health of the local population and public image; and realisation of potential income through the sale of by- products and waste materials. Economy Kalundborg Municipality is home to approximately 19,000 jobs of which 13,000 are in the private sector (December 2014). Novo Nordisk has extensive production facilities in Kalundborg with a total of more than 2,400 employees. Since 1999 they have invested more than DKK 7.5 billions in the complex. Pronova BioPharma Danmark, a bulk manufacturer of Omega-3 products which was acquired by BASF in 2014, also has a manufaction plant in Kalundborg. Port of Kalundborg The port plays a central role in the town's economy. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. Kalundborg Container Terminal is served by Unifeeder on a weekly basis. Schultz Shipping is a local shipping company. As of 2015, the port is being expanded with a new west harbor on the south side of the Asn√¶s peninsula.

His later career has been as a composer of music for television programs and films. Many people know this artist from the American version of \\"The Office\\" from NBC. Childhood and early musical career Born in Burbank, California, in the San Fernando Valley, Ferguson grew up in the Van Nuys and Canoga Park sections of Los Angeles. At 12 years old, Ferguson's parents encouraged his musical abilities with classical piano lessons. When he was 16, Ferguson's interest transferred to the banjo. Along with his brother Tom, an accomplished fiddle player, he formed a bluegrass group called The Oat Hill Stump Straddlers including Michael Fondiler and Steve Fondiler. Ferguson was also a member of local garage bands Western Union and The Red Roosters. He also held part-time jobs at different points as a theater usher and an architect's assistant for his father John Ferguson, and taught piano in a music store and studied at UCLA after high school. The band Spirit Spirit was founded in the mid-1960s. Many musicians of the time cited The Beatles and their music as an influence, and Ferguson was no exception. Reuniting with longtime musician friends Randy California and California's stepfather Ed Cassidy, who, with Mark Andes and John Locke were in a band called the Red Roosters - Ferguson joined with them to form a jazz influenced rock group that was originally called Spirits Rebellious, after a Khalil Gibran passage. With the general consensus that the moniker was too long, they later shortened the name to Spirit. Ferguson was the last member to join the band and found himself in the position of lead vocalist and percussionist. Ferguson shared singing and songwriting duties with California, writing most of the songs on their first album. Spirit began playing at various nightclubs and concerts in the Los Angeles area, especially the clubs along the Sunset Strip, including Whiskey-a-Go-Go. At one of these shows, French film producer Jacques Demy saw Spirit perform and decided he wanted them in his next film. This led to a cameo role for the band and a short speaking part in which Ferguson played a character based loosely on himself in the film Model Shop. Spirit also provided much of the instrumental soundtrack. The band went on to tour and record several albums. Jo Jo Gunne Ferguson and Mark Andes decided to leave Spirit in 1971 and form their own band. Ferguson was Jo Jo Gunne's main songwriter (writing virtually all the material) and only lead vocalist. Jo Jo Gunne became the second act signed to the new Asylum Records label. The band scored a moderate hit with \\"Run, Run, Run\\" from their debut album (1972). With the first record and some touring already completed, Mark Andes decided to leave and join a band that would later become Firefall, with his brother Matt staying behind with Jo Jo Gunne. Jimmie Randall, an Austin, Texas bassist was recruited in Mark's place. Jo Jo Gunne toured all over the US and Europe for the next three years, and recorded three more albums, Bite Down Hard (1973), Jumpin' The Gunne (1974) and Where's The Show (1975). Matt Andes left the band after the third album and was temporarily replaced with Star Donaldson on lead guitar, and then, later, John Staehely. After a four-year existence, the group split up in the mid-1970s. Jo Jo Gunne reformed in 2005, and recorded a new album, Big Chain, which included both new material and new versions of several old Gunne songs. Solo career Ferguson took a year and a half off to rest, until record producer Bill Szymczyk asked Ferguson to come down to his Coconut Grove recording studio in Miami. He contributed in 1975 on piano and vocals to Joe Walsh's live recording of You Can't Argue with a Sick Mind before Walsh subsequently went on to join Eagles. Ferguson recorded three studio albums and a limited-run live album for Asylum. While managed by Martin Pichinson, he scored a Top 10 hit with the title song on his second solo album, Thunder Island (1978), which peaked at #9 in the US. Another minor hit was \\"Shakedown Cruise\\" (#31) from his last Asylum album, Real Life Ain't This Way. After his recording contract for Asylum was completed, Ferguson changed record labels, and recorded two more solo albums for Capitol Records. Soundtrack composer In 1982, after his sixth and last solo album, White Noise, Ferguson decided to become a soundtrack composer for movies and television. To date, he has written music for over 15 feature films and for many TV shows. His most recognizable composition as a TV and film scorer is the theme to the NBC-TV version of The Office, which won him the 2007 Film & TV Music Award for Best Score for a Comedy Television Program. (In The Office, He is also the guitarist in Kevin's band \\"Scrantonicity.\\") Ferguson recently began producing albums for other artists. He is the composer of \\"Pictures of You\\" from the soundtrack to The Terminator, and the entire score to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child and Bad Dreams, as well as the Tales From The Crypt episode ‚ÄùForever Ambergris‚Äù. Ferguson is also the current soundtrack composer for NCIS: Los Angeles, having replaced original composer James S. Levine halfway through season 1 with Ferguson's music debuting in the season 1 episode, \\"Chinatown\\".

Background The addition of an embedded marksman at the platoon or squad level has been a continuing process in the U.S. military. The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) experimented with this during Project Metropolis, before creating the \\"Squad Advanced Marksman\\" (SAM) position along with the Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle (SAM-R) specifically for this purpose. The 3rd Infantry Division followed suit in implementing a training program to have one marksman per squad, the Squad Designated Marksman (SDM), and developing a rifle, the Squad Designated Marksman Rifle (SDM-R). The SDM is an integral part of the squad and serves as a rifleman first and designated marksman second. The SDM is not meant to be a squad sniper who engages the enemy with precision fire at long ranges, but instead is trained to directly support the squad with well-aimed shots at ranges slightly beyond the normal engagement distances for riflemen. Much like the U.S. Marine Corps SAM-R, the 3rd Infantry division SDM-R was an accurized M16 rifle (5.56√ó45mm NATO caliber) built in-house by the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, and was informally known as \\"the AMU rifle\\". SDM-Rs have only been built for one major Army division and is not an Army program of record. The SDM-R is designed to provide engagement capability at the squad level to 600 meters, similar to the needs expressed by members of USSOCOM that led to the development of weapons such as the United States Navy Mark 12 Mod X Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) and the SEAL Recon Rifle. The National Guard Marksmanship Training Center of the Arkansas Army National Guard conducts the fourteen-day-long Squad Designated Marksman Course at Camp Joseph T. Robinson. Soldiers fire over 1500-rounds from the M16A4 rifle under the close supervision of course cadre. Task Force Small Arms Readiness Group (TF SARG) conducts the week-long SDM course at the SARG academy at Camp Bullis, Texas. Many of the instructors are President's 100 recipients. Specifications *The US Army used either M16A2 or A4 lower receivers previously supplied by either Colt or Fabrique Nationale de Herstal. All rifles were equipped with a fixed A2 stock and a Knight's Armament Company 2-stage match grade trigger The upper receivers were flat top style, but unlike the SAM-R and SPR, they did not have extended feed ramps. *Barrel: The 1:7 twist, barrel from the M16A2 and A4 were replaced with a stainless steel Douglas Barrels 1:8 twist, 20-inch barrel, with 12 flutes cut into the barrel to reduce weight. The front sight block was installed with 4 set screws instead of two taper pins. The SDM-R retained the A2-style flash hider. *Sights and optics: The issued optic was a 4√ó32 Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) (models TA31F, TA31RCO, TA01, TA01B, or TA01NSN). A Matech Industries 600-meter backup iron sight was also used. *Handguard: Daniel Defense M4 Rail 12.0 handguard, with an octagonal aluminum collar locking it to the upper receiver. The handguard provides a free-floating Picatinny rail forend. *Bipod: A Harris S-L bipod attached to an ARMS #32 throw-lever rail mount was mounted to the underside of the handguard. Since the handguard was free-floating, it did not come into contact with the barrel, and any pressure from the bipod on the handguard did not deflect the barrel. Variants The 82nd Airborne Division examined an alternate version, based on the M4 carbine. The barrel was to have been an long fluted Douglas barrel with 1:8 twist. A mid-length gas system was to be used, along with the Daniel Defense M4Rail 9.0 handguard. This effort never went beyond the staffing process.

The whisky was created on 23 March 1923 as a product of Berry Bros. & Rudd, with the home of the blend considered to be at The Glenrothes distillery in the Speyside region of Scotland. The name comes from the River Clyde-built clipper ship Cutty Sark, whose name came from the Scots term \\"cutty-sark\\", the short shirt [skirt] prominently mentioned in the famous poem by Robert Burns, \\"Tam o' Shanter\\". The drawing of the clipper ship Cutty Sark on the label of the whisky bottles is a work of the Swedish artist Carl Georg August Wallin. He was a mariner painter, and this is probably his most famous ship painting. This drawing has been on the whisky bottles since 1955. The Tall Ships' Races for large sailing ships were originally known as The Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races, under the terms of sponsorship by the whisky brand. US distribution Cutty Sark was originally distributed in the United States by Buckingham Co., which was acquired by Allied Lyons (later Allied Domecq) in 1989. Skyy Spirits bought the distribution rights from Allied Domeq in 1999. After Edrington acquired the brand, it switched US distribution from Skyy to R√©my Cointreau USA. Edrington launched its own distribution unit in the US in 2014. Bottlings The most popular member of the range, Cutty Sark Original Scots Whisky, is sold in a distinctive green bottle with a yellow label. The range also includes other blends, and premium blends, currently identified by the age of the youngest whisky in the blending Reviews Cutty Sark has received modest reviews from international spirit ratings organisations. In 2008, 2009, and 2011 for example, the San Francisco World Spirits Competition awarded the Cutty Sark blended scotch bronze and silver medals. The Beverage Testing Institute gave Cutty Sark modest scores of 85 and 87 in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Early life and education Buildings that housed sheet music publishers on Tin Pan Alley Botsford was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, but grew up mostly in Clermont, Iowa. He married singer Della Mae Wilson, and in 1900, they began touring with the Hoyle Stock Company troupe. An ad promoting Botsford and his wife as musicians appeared in the New York Clipper in 1901, which may indicate the first time that Botsford visited New York City. Career Botsford's first copyrighted number was \\"The Katy Flyer\\", published in 1899 in Centerville, Iowa. Other early numbers followed themes of relaxation and wide open space, with \\"Dance of the Water Nymphs\\", which was sold as Hawaiian mood music, and Western- themed \\"In Dear Old Arizona\\" and \\"Pride of the Prairie\\". This would change when Botsford moved to New York City, where he joined an assortment of Tin Pan Alley composers and began writing ragtime almost exclusively. Botsford secured his first songwriting contract with New York's J. H. Remick & Co. after selling them \\"Pride of the Prairie\\". It was while on that contract that he published \\"Black and White Rag\\", which stands as perhaps the most known work of his career. He was put in charge of vocal arrangements for Remick's \\"harmony & quartet\\" division in 1910. Botsford was a founding member of ASCAP in 1914. From 1914 to 1915, he experimented with miniature opera intended to be sung by three or four people, but the idea never gained momentum. Later life and death By the 1920s, Botsford had largely stopped composing, and mostly made his living through organizing vaudeville performances. He produced a handful of musical shows for stage and radio. His last known public performance was at the Algonquin Hotel in 1934. After a long career involving many kinds of music, Botsford died in New York on February 1, 1949. Legacy A 1912 cartoon referencing the \\"Grizzly Bear\\" dance \\"Pride of the Prairie\\" is a prime example of Tin Pan Alley's response to the rising popularity of cowboy music. Many western-themed songs were being released by New York ragtime composers at the time, but Prairie would become a part of the era's folk music catalogue, eventually being recorded by numerous country and folk acts including Aaron Campbell's Mountaineers, Tex Owens, and Patsy Montana. \\"Black and White Rag\\" sold over 200,000 copies in 1908, and eventually topped one million copies sold. The song was recorded by numerous artists, but most notably by Winifred Atwell, whose 1953 recording became a gold record and was used as the theme of the long-running BBC2 snooker tournament show, \\"Pot Black\\". The song was also used as theme music for the 1985 video game Repton. \\"Grizzly Bear Rag\\" initially saw moderate success, but jumped in popularity when Irving Berlin composed lyrics for it. The song was recorded under titles including Dance of the Grizzly Bear and Doin' the Grizzly Bear, and helped spark a trend of naming dances after animals; the most notable example of this being the foxtrot. \\"Sailing Down the Chesapeake Bay\\" became very popular at its time, and was recorded later by Bing Crosby for his 1975 album, A Southern Memoir.

WTMJ also simulcasts on an FM translator, W277CV (103.3). The station is owned by Good Karma Brands along with ESPN Radio affiliates WAUK and WKTI. Established in 1927 by The Milwaukee Journal, the station was the flagship radio station of the Journal Broadcast Group until April 2015, when it came under the ownership of the E. W. Scripps Company. JBG also owned the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, WTMJ-TV and sister radio station WKTI, along with other media assets across the U.S. (WTMJ remained owned with WTMJ-TV and WKTI until Good Karma acquired the radio stations in 2018, with the Journal Sentinel owned by the Journal Media Group spin-off until its April 2016 merger with Gannett). WTMJ maintains studio facilities located on Capitol Drive in Milwaukee (this Art Deco facility is known as \\"Radio City\\" in tribute to the New York complex of the same name), and its transmitter is located in Union Grove. As of February 22, 2018, WTMJ's HD Radio simulcast on WKTI-HD2 (which launched after Scripps' assumption of ownership) is translated within the core Milwaukee metro in analog form on W277CV (103.3), which is licensed to Milwaukee and transmits from the WTMJ-TV/WKTI tower just north of Radio City. WTMJ and WKTI are the two stations in southeastern Wisconsin responsible for Emergency Alert System alerts as a primary entry point for the state's EAS system.http://www.sbe24.org/eas/AP-J0915.pdf The station also has served as the flagship outlet for Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Bucks and Milwaukee Brewers games for most of the teams' histories, with Packers broadcasts airing on WTMJ since 1929. Technical details The station's AM signal broadcasts a 50,000-watt signal during daytime hours, and 10,000 watts during nighttime hours. Because of its signal strength, as well as Wisconsin's flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity) and its location near the bottom of the AM dial, WTMJ boasts one of the largest coverage areas in the nation. Its daytime \\"city-grade\\" signal reaches most of the eastern third of Wisconsin, including Madison and Green Bay, and it provides at least grade B coverage to most of the eastern two-thirds of the state. Additionally, the station provides at least grade B coverage to most of the Chicago area, as well as Grand Rapids, Michigan. From 2006 until 2018, the station broadcast in HD Radio, but the low adoption of AM HD Radio technology and the launch of W277CV allowed Scripps to choose to end HD Radio service at that time. W277CV's FM signal is licensed as a translator station transmitting at the standard 250 watts, but with its location atop the WTMJ-TV tower, sits upon a taller location than most translators (at ), thus its radius is able to cover much more terrain, including the WOW counties, and covers not only Milwaukee County, but most of Waukesha, Racine, Washington and Ozaukee counties (ranging from as far north as Cedar Grove to as far south as Kenosha). In addition, since most of its programming is spoken-word talk radio and sports coverage rather than music, it is carried in monaural sound rather than the standard stereo of most FM stations, which allows the signal to radiate further from the tower without stereo-caused degradation on the fringe of its signal radius. History In May 1922, The Milwaukee Journal sponsored its first radio program on Milwaukee's first radio station, WAAK, which was owned by the local division of the Gimbel's department store chain. The Journal bought radio station WKAF in April 1927 and built a new transmitter in Brookfield, west of Milwaukee. Then in June 1927, The Federal Radio Commission allowed the assignment of WTMJ to the station, to stand for The Milwaukee Journal. On July 25, 1927, WTMJ Radio went on the air at 1020 AM to complement the Journal. WTMJ's first broadcast featured music by the WTMJ Orchestra and included a remote broadcast featuring Bill Carlsen's orchestra. Carlsen was later hired by WTMJ and went on to become Wisconsin's most widely known radio and television weather forecaster. In 1928, The Federal Radio Commission reassigned WTMJ to 620 kHz. Some listeners began encountering interference from radio stations that shared frequencies in other parts of the country. Engineers solved the problem by developing directional radio signals, which are created by using multiple towers and controlled phasing. This allowed stations on the same frequency to protect each other, while providing strong signals to their intended coverage areas. In 1932, it was WTMJ's protected status on 620 kHz that led to the development of the first modern AM directional antenna system, as WFLA in Tampa, Florida created a directional signal pattern in order to protect Milwaukee's WTMJ (WFLA moved to 970 in 1941, with WSUN taking its place in Tampa, followed by the current-day WDAE). Directional signals for AM stations continue to be used to this day. In 1942, a new facility, the Milwaukee Journal's Radio City, opened for WTMJ-AM and FM, in addition to the yet-to- come WTMJ-TV. An article in the trade magazine Broadcasting reported that the building was the \\"first ever designed to house all three types of broadcasting.\\" WTMJ spent much of its life operating at 5 kW from Brookfield, which was still powerful enough to cover much of eastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois. However, when the 5 kW power limit on regional channels was lifted, WTMJ was the first station in line for an upgrade. WTMJ was granted permission in 1995 to upgrade to 50 kW days and 10 kW nights from a new six- tower site in Union Grove, south of Milwaukee; the Brookfield site's real estate was sold for development in the suburban community. The station's signal is directed generally north during both daytime and nighttime operation. During the day, four-towers are used. At night, all six towers are used, creating a tighter northward beam. WTMJ aired a full service MOR format featuring a mixture of music, news and local personalities along with sports play-by-play before switching to its current news and talk format in the early 1990s. WTMJ has long had a heavy sports presence, and has been the flagship station for Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Bucks and Milwaukee Brewers (the only times WTMJ did not air Brewers games were the 1970, 1981 and 1982 seasons, with WEMP airing them in 1970 [also the Brewers' first season of play], and WISN airing them in 1981-82http://archive.jsonline.com/entertainment/tvradio/brewers-wtmj-radio-a- winning-combination-131560733.html) games for most of the teams' histories. The Packers have been on WTMJ since 1929, the longest relationship between a station and an NFL team. From 1927 to 2014, WTMJ served as the Milwaukee outlet for Wisconsin Badgers football and men's basketball. It was the flagship station until 1993, when a station employee filed the paperwork for renewing its contract just minutes after the deadline (The WIBA/WIBA-FM stations in Madison took the flagship rights, with Learfield Media beginning to produce all Badger sports programming). The broadcasts moved to WOKY and WRIT-FM in 2014, after WTMJ elected to not renew its contract with Learfield. WTMJ is one of the few stations in the market to feature mostly live and local programming. WTMJ airs news programming in the morning with Gene Mueller and Jane Matenaer and in the afternoon with John Mercure. Doug Russell and Greg Matzek provide sports updates for those shows, respectively. During the midday, the station airs live and local talk shows with Jeff Wagner and (Steve) Scaffidi along with (Erik) Bilstad, host talk shows - and during the evenings Matzek hosts a sports program known as Sports Central. Late evenings (when WTMJ is not airing sports play-by-play) and overnights, WTMJ airs syndicated personalities Clark Howard, Jim Bohannon, Red Eye Radio and Gordon Deal. During the weekend the station airs a mixture of local how-to programming, talk shows, local sports talk programs, sports play-by-play and national talk shows, with much less weekend brokered programming than most major market AM stations. WTMJ's talk programming offers listeners content from current events to politics, as well as humor, lifestyle information and sports talk. The station also continues its commitment to news with Milwaukee's only 24/7 staffed newsroom, while also partnering with sister TV station WTMJ-TV for additional news and weather coverage. Journal Communications and the E. W. Scripps Company announced on July 30, 2014 that the two companies would merge to create a new broadcast company under the E.W. Scripps Company name that will own the two companies' broadcast properties, including WTMJ-AM, WTMJ-TV, and WKTI-FM. The deal separated the WTMJ stations from the Journal Sentinel after nine decades, as the two companies' newspapers were spun off into a separate company under the Journal Media Group name (that company merged with Gannett itself in April 2016; both WTMJ entities eventually partnered with the Milwaukee Business Journal after the sale for business coverage). The transaction was completed on April 1, 2015; E.W. Scripps will also continue to originate the Packers and Brewers radio networks. On February 22, 2018, WTMJ began simulcasting on a monaural FM translator, W277CV (103.3), from the WTMJ-TV/WKTI tower. The transmitter, formerly individually licensed to Frank Glass McCoy and leased to Scripps (who owns the physical tower and transmitter assets) and operated by Good Karma Brands, was formerly licensed to Waukegan, Illinois and translated Kenosha public radio station WGTD before the move of the translator to Milwaukee. McCoy sold the translator license to Auslator, LLC in May 2019. On July 27, 2018, as part of its exit from radio, Scripps announced the sale of WTMJ and WKTI to Good Karma Brands. The stations became part of a cluster with ESPN Radio affiliate WAUK. Morgan Murphy Media and other local groups have made investments in Good Karma Brands to back the purchase. Good Karma took control of WTMJ and WKTI on November 1, 2018, thus separating WTMJ-AM from its TV cousin for the first time.

It has traditionally been the homeland of indigenous Central Kenyan communities up to the colonial period, when it became the centre of European settlement in Kenya, and between 1902 and 1961 was officially reserved for the exclusive use of Europeans by the colonial government. Name The first European explorers and administrators used the term Highlands to refer to the region no less than 5,000 feet (1,524 m) above sea level, best suited climatically for Europeans to reside in.Morgan, W. T. W. \\"The 'White Highlands' of Kenya.\\" The Geographical Journal 129, no. 2 (1963): 140-55. . During the process of settlement, the term came to be used for those areas not already settled by local African tribes. As The Crown Lands Ordinance of 1902 only permitted land grants to Europeans, the Highlands came to mean only the lands Europeans could own and manage. History=Exploration To many early explorers and administrators, the cool climate and absence of populations over large swathes of the Highlands, made it a uniquely attractive area for European settlement in sub-tropical Africa. In 1893, the explorer Frederick Lugard, whilst lobbying for a railway in East Africa, noted that European settlement in the region was not feasible until the cooler Highlands were made accessible. This view was echoed by Sir Harry Johnston who, on completion of the Uganda Railway, noted of the Highlands: Settlement In 1902, Sir Charles Eliot, then British Commissioner of the Protectorate, encouraged settlement of the Highlands for farming. Commissioner Eliot, a leading critic of building the railway, believed the only way to recoup the money spent on its construction was by opening up the Highlands for farming.William Robert Ochieng', Robert M. Maxon, An Economic History of Kenya, East African Publishers, 1992, p.113 In his view, only European settlers and agriculture could develop the region and generate the necessary funds to fund the colonial administration. Eliot's view was supported by pioneer settlers such as The 3rd Baron Delamere and Ewart Grogan, who believed that they had a civilising mission to transform the entire country into a modern industrialised \\"White Man's Country\\". By 1903 there were about 100 European settlers in the Highlands.William Robert Ochieng', Robert M. Maxon, An Economic History of Kenya, East African Publishers, 1992, p.114 A large proportion of the settlers hailed from South Africa including 280 Boers from the Transvaal who settled in the Uasin Gishu plateau in 1908. By 1914, there were around a thousand European settlers in the Highlands. In 1914, around twenty percent of the leases held in the region were held by 13 individuals or groups. The granting of leases to settlers for low prices resulted in rampant land speculation, to the extent that by 1930 approximately sixty five percent of land reserved for Europeans was not under any form of agriculturally productive activity. Alienation When European settlement began, the Highlands were primarily inhabited by nomadic pastoralists and this absence of settled agrarian communities led British officials to believing the region was uninhabited.Sana Aiyar, Indians in Kenya, Harvard University Press, 6 Apr 2015, At the time, the African population was distributed between cultivating tribes and pastoralist people. The cultivating tribes existed mainly in the high rainfall areas of Nyanza and the slopes at the foot of Mount Kenya such as the Aberdares, Elgeyo and the hills of Ukambani. The intervening areas consisted of extensive but sparsely inhabited plains, at over 5,000 feet, where rainfall was more uncertain and pastoralists instead relied on the grazing of animals. European settlement was predominately in these extensive plains, traditionally inhabited by the Maasai tribe. At the turn of the century, the Maasai had been decimated by a concurrence of natural disasters. Accompanying a smallpox epidemic was a severe drought and an invasion of locusts which consumed vegetation over large tracts of land, whilst rinderpest had killed large numbers of cattle resulting in starvation within the community.Whittlesey, Derwent. \\"Kenya, the Land and Mau Mau.\\" Foreign Affairs 32, no. 1 (1953): 80-90. The Maasai entered into treaties with British officials to surrender large amounts of land, which reduced manpower meant they were unable to defend against rival tribes. Of the 12,000 square miles of European settled land, 7,000 consisted of former Masai grazing grounds abandoned under agreements between 1904 and 1913, and large parts of remaining areas, such as the Uasin Gishu plateau, were uninhabited. British officials also alienated land from other tribes, whom the Maasai had pushed to woodlands on the fringes of the Highlands. These tribes practised shifting cultivation, resulting in large areas of land remaining abandoned for a number of years. Similar disasters as afflicted the Maasai also caused havoc amongst these tribes and, between 1901-02, a famine resulted in the Kikuyu losing between twenty and fifty percent of their population on their frontier with the Maasai. Many survivors sought refuge amongst relatives elsewhere in their domain, but by leaving their land it made the frontier appear disused to European officials. Before the famine, the Kikuyu had been buying up parcels of land in the frontier for individual holdings. When British officials later began paying the Kikuyu for that land, they believed they were acquiring the land freehold. However, because the transaction had not followed native customs, the Kikuyu believed the British were only renting the land until the Kikuyu wished to reclaim it in future. This confusion laid the seeds for future enmity between the Kikuyu and European settlers, culminating in the Mau Mau Rebellion. End of reservation The reservation of the White Highlands for Europeans by administrative practice was ended by the Land Control Regulations in 1961. Extent Initially the region was not clearly defined, instead lying between two points on the railway track, namely Kiu and Fort Ternan, and later from Sultan Hamud to Kibigori. It was not until 1939 that the boundaries were defined in the 7th Schedule to The Crown Lands Ordinance under authority of the Kenya (Highlands) Order in Council, 1939. The Order also established a Highlands Board with a majority elected by the Legislative Council to advise and make recommendations on the disposal of land in the region. Today Today, the region is at the heart of Kenya's economy. It is the country's best served region by road and rail and has many flourishing cities such as Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kitale, Thika, Kericho and Nyeri.Joseph R. Oppong, Esther D. Oppong, Kenya, Infobase Publishing, 2009, p.35 Although covering only five percent of Kenya's total land area, it produces most of Kenya's agricultural exports, particularly tea, coffee, sisal and pyrethrum.

Following the latter war, he became the first American Military Governor of the Philippines. Early life Merritt was born in New York City. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1860 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd Dragoons, serving initially in Utah under John Buford. He became the adjutant for the unit when it was renamed the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. Civil War Major General Wesley Merritt. Photograph taken sometime between 1860 and 1870. In 1862, Merritt was appointed captain in the 2nd Cavalry and served as an aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. Philip St. George Cooke, who commanded the Cavalry Department of the Army of the Potomac. He served in the defenses of Washington, D.C., for the rest of 1862. In 1863, he was appointed adjutant for Maj. Gen. George Stoneman and participated in Stoneman's Raid in the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863. In the Gettysburg Campaign, Merritt commanded the Reserve Brigade, 1st Division, Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. He was slightly wounded in the Battle of Brandy Station; on June 29, 1863, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers for his \\"gallant and meritorious service\\" at Brandy Station and Upperville. Being promoted directly from captain to brigadier general was an unusual step, even for the Civil War, but Merritt shared this honor on that date with Captain Elon J. FarnsworthOn June 29, 1863 President Abraham Lincoln nominated Farnsworth to the grade brigadier general of volunteers. A day earlier, Brigadier General Alfred Pleasanton assigned Farnsworth to command a brigade in the Union Army Cavalry Corps. Farnsworth was killed in action at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863 and his nomination was never confirmed by the United States Senate so he remained a captain when he was killed. Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 596. and Captain George Armstrong Custer. In the initial cavalry actions of the Battle of Gettysburg, Merritt saw no action; his reserve brigade guarded the lines of communications of the Army of the Potomac. On July 3, 1863, however, he participated in the assault ordered by division commander Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick on the Confederate right flank, following Pickett's Charge. His fellow general, Elon J. Farnsworth, was killed during this futile assault against infantry troops. Merritt took over command of the 1st Division of the Cavalry Corps following the death by typhoid fever of its commander, John Buford, in December 1863. Brig. Gen. Alfred Torbert was the initial commander of the 1st Division but was absent ill for most of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign in 1864, so Merritt acted as commander in his place. He received a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his actions at the Battle of Yellow Tavern, the engagement in which Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart was killed. During Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's Valley Campaigns of 1864, Merritt commanded the 1st Division, Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Shenandoah. Arriving at the opportune moment, his division routed the Confederate forces at the Third Battle of Winchester, a deed for which he received a brevet promotion to major general of the volunteers. Upon his return his Cavalry was deployed across the valley, burning, destroying or taking away everything of value or likely to become of value to the enemy. October 5 his division alone destroyed from Port Republic to Toms Brook 630 barns, 47 mills, 410,742 bushels of wheat, 515 acres of corn not counting private homes. He was second-in-command to Sheridan during the Appomattox Campaign and was one of several commissioners for the surrender at Appomattox Court House. He was brevetted major general in the regular army, in April 1865, for bravery at the Battle of Five Forks and the Appomattox Campaign. In June 1865, Merritt was appointed command of Cavalry Forces of the Military Division of the Southwest, commanded by Sheridan. He led the 1st Division of Cavalry to march from Shreveport, Louisiana, to San Antonio, Texas, as part of the Union occupation forces on an arduous 33-day 600-mile march between July 9 and August 11, 1865. On January 28, 1866, Merritt was one of a number of brevetted generals mustered out of volunteer service and returned to their pre-war ranks in the regular army. Frontier duty and West Point After the war's end, Merritt continued to serve in the cavalry along the frontier. He was appointed lieutenant colonel of the newly raised U.S. 9th Cavalry on July 28, 1866, and in July 1867 was sent to command Fort Davis, Texas, garrisoned by six of the regiment's companies. He was made colonel of the 5th Cavalry on July 1, 1876, which he commanded in the Battle of Slim Buttes during the Indian Wars. As colonel of the 5th Cavalry, Merritt was a member of the court of inquiry which first sat on January 13, 1879 presided over by Colonel John H. King of the 9th Infantry, which was convened to consider the behavior of Major Marcus A. Reno of the 7th Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn (June 25 to 26, 1876); which resulted in the death of General George Armstrong Custer and over 200 men of the 7th Cavalry. He served on the frontier until being appointed superintendent of West Point, a post he filled from 1882 to 1887. In 1887, he was appointed brigadier general in the Regular Army. He was promoted to major general in the U.S. Army in 1895. Merritt was a companion of the Illinois Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War After Commodore Dewey's Asiatic Squadron destroyed Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo's Spanish Pacific Squadron at the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, the United States began to organize ground forces to attack and capture the city of Manila. Merritt was placed in command of the newly created Eighth Army Corps. In June 1898, Merritt and the available troops of the corps departed from San Francisco for the Philippines. When Merritt arrived in Manila, he and Dewey made preparations for the attack on the city. The two intentionally kept Emilio Aguinaldo in the dark about the plans for the attack because the Americans did not want Aguinaldo's forces to end up in control of the city. Merritt and Dewey made arrangements with Governor General Ferm√≠n J√°udenes, commander of the Spanish garrison, to surrender the city to the American forces after the latter put up a token resistance. The city fell to the Americans on August 13, 1898, and Merritt became the first American military governor of the Philippines. Merritt was relieved by Major General Elwell Stephen Otis on August 30 to advise the United States delegation in the peace negotiations leading to the Treaty of Paris. Based on his Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War service, Merritt became a member of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.https://archive.org/stream/registerofmilita1900mili#page/194/mode/2up Family and death Merritt was married twice. His first wife was Caroline Warren Merritt, who died on June 12, 1893 at the age of 44. She is buried at West Point Cemetery. Merritt's second wife was Laura Williams Caton, daughter of John D. Caton, whom he met in the late 1890s, when she was in her mid- twenties. General Merritt and Laura Williams were married in London on October 24, 1898.

They provided products for voice and audio processing, imaging and modems. The company began as a division of Rockwell International, before being spun off as a public company. Conexant itself then spun off several business units, creating independent public companies which included Skyworks Solutions and Mindspeed Technologies. The company was acquired by computing interface technology company Synaptics, Inc. in July 2017. History The motherboard for a dial-up modem for the Sega Dreamcast video game console, showing a Conexant chip. In 1996, Rockwell International Corporation incorporated its semiconductor division as Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, Inc. On January 4, 1999, Rockwell spun off Conexant Systems, Inc. as a public company. It was listed on the NASDAQ under symbol CNXT on January 4, 1999. At that time, Conexant became the world's largest, standalone communications-IC company. Dwight W. Decker was its first chief executive officer and chairman of its board of directors. The company was based in Newport Beach, California. In the early 2000s, Conexant spun off several standalone technology businesses to create public companies. In March 2002, Conexant entered into a joint venture agreement with The Carlyle Group to share ownership of its wafer fabrication plant, called Jazz Semiconductor. In June 2002, Conexant spun off its wireless communications division, which merged immediately following the spinoff with Massachusetts-based chip manufacturer Alpha Industries Inc. to form publicly held Skyworks Solutions Inc. In June 2003, Conexant spun off its Internet infrastructure business to create the publicly held company Mindspeed Technologies Inc. Mindspeed would eventually be acquired by Lowell, MA-based M/A-COM Technology Solutions. In 2004, Conexant merged with Red Bank, New Jersey semiconductor company GlobespanVirata, Inc., with Conexant as the surviving corporation. Subsequently, GlobespanVirata‚Äôs name was changed to Conexant, Inc. In April 2008, Conexant announced the sale of its broadband media processing business, which provided products for satellite, cable and IPTV applications, to Dutch semiconductor manufacturer NXP Semiconductors NV. In September 2008, Jazz was sold to Israel-based Tower Semiconductor Ltd and became known as TowerJazz. In August 2009, Conexant sold its broadband access product line to Fremont, CA semiconductor company Ikanos Communications. In February 2011, an agreement was announced for San Francisco investment firm Golden Gate Capital to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Conexant at a price of $2.40 per share, and take the company private. In February 2013, citing the burden of servicing debt related to multiple corporate acquisitions in the late 1990s, as well as the loss of revenue from the bankruptcy of key customer Eastman Kodak, Conexant filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. As part of the bankruptcy agreement, the company agreed on a restructuring plan with owners and its sole secured lender, QP SFM Capital Holdings Ltd. The reorganized company emerged from bankruptcy in July 2013. As part of the operational restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from Newport Beach to nearby Irvine, and focused on a narrower product portfolio, consisting of far-field voice input processing-based devices, video surveillance and printer systems on a chip (SoCs). Since 2013, Conexant's silicon and software solutions for voice processing have been instrumental in the CE industry's proliferation of voice-enabled devices. The company's AudioSmart brand of voice input processors and embedded far-field processing software has become adopted by CE device manufacturers in numerous products ranging from Artificially Intelligent digital assistant devices and smart speakers to voice-enabled televisions and personal robots. In February 2016, it was announced that Korean electronics company LG Electronics was going to integrate Conexant's CX2092x far-field voice input processor system- on-chip (SoC) into two of its smart home products: a set top box and an IoT hub for controlling home electronic devices. In March 2016, Conexant announced that their AudioSmart software was being integrated into Qualcomm's Hexagon digital signal processor family, a major component of Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor reportedly contained in over 1 billion smart devices. In December 2016, Conexant and Amazon co-announced the AudioSmart 2-Mic Development Kit for Amazon AVS, a commercial-grade reference solution that streamlines the design and implementation of audio front end systems. Based on the Conexant AudioSmart‚Ñ¢ CX20921 Voice Input Processor, the dual microphone board was designed to reduce time-to-market for new third-party voice-enabled Alexa devices. Conexant 2-Mic Dev Kit for AVS Devices On 11 May 2017 news appeared that security researchers discovered that Conexant's audio drivers were installing keylogger software, including many laptops sold by HP. The keylogger writes every single keystroke typed by a user (including passwords) and stores them in an unencrypted file on the user's computer. On July 26, 2017, Synaptics completed its acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC. Product line Conexant has two main product families: the AudioSmart brand of audio processors and the ImagingSmart brand of image processors and modems.

Tom Turpin was born in Savannah, Georgia, a son of John L. Turpin and Lulu Waters Turpin. In his early twenties he opened a saloon in St. Louis, Missouri which became a meeting-place for local pianists and an incubation point for early folk ragtime, such as musician Joe Jordan. Turpin himself is credited with the first published rag by an African-American, his \\"Harlem Rag\\" of 1897 (it was composed by 1892, a year before ragtime's introduction to the world at the 1893 Worlds Fair). His other published rags include \\"Bowery Buck,\\" \\"Ragtime Nightmare,\\" \\"St. Louis Rag,\\" and \\"The Buffalo Rag\\". Turpin was a large man, six feet (1.83 m) tall and 300 pounds (136 kg); his piano had to be raised on blocks so that he could play it standing up, otherwise his stomach would get in the way. In addition to his saloon-keeping duties and his ragtime composition, he controlled (with his brother Charles) a theater, gambling houses, dance halls, and sporting houses. He served as a deputy constable and was one of the first politically powerful African-Americans in St. Louis. His influence on local music earned him the title \\"Father of St. Louis Ragtime.\\" Date Turpin's date of birth is uncertain; both 1871 and 1873 appear in published sources.

He was born in Kansas City, Kansas, died in Kansas City, Missouri, and lived his entire life in those two cities. He published over 300 songs in his life, nearly 40 of them ragtime compositions such as \\"Doc Brown‚Äôs Cakewalk\\", \\"Dill Pickles\\", \\"Apple Jack (Some Rag)\\", and \\"Snookums Rag\\". His best selling piece, a sentimental ballad called \\"Sweet and Low\\", sold over a million copies. Experts believe that had Johnson lived and worked in New York, he would be included alongside Scott Joplin, James Scott, and Joseph Lamb as one of the greatest ragtime composers. He wrote more than the other three combined and exemplified a greater range of talent, composing waltzes, tangos, cakewalks, marches, novelty pieces, and other types of music popular at that time. Early life and education Johnson was born in the Armourdale district of Kansas City, Kansas to James R. and Helen F. Johnson. Clearly a prodigy, he was playing a neighbor‚Äôs piano by age six and began studying classical piano, harmony, and music theory a few years later. Although he had classical training, he always preferred popular music of the day. His musical ability led him to proficiency on other instruments as well: guitar, violin, banjo, and mandolin. As a young man Johnson became involved in the music scene of Kansas City by participating in several local groups. In this environment he wrote his first compositions. Personal life Johnson was married twice, first to Sylvia Hoskins in 1901, and they had a daughter Frances. The marriage ended in unclear circumstances; the ultimate fates of Sylvia or Frances are unknown. He married his second wife, Eva Otis, in 1926. She remained with him until his death in 1950. Career Johnson‚Äôs career was stable and prolific. He began work in the late 1890s for the J.W. Jenkins and Sons Music Company in Kansas City, Missouri plugging songs and playing piano. Over the next five years Jenkins would publish twelve of Johnson‚Äôs songs. Eventually Johnson would compose for many other publishers. By 1907, Johnson had also formed his own publishing company, putting out his own music and those of other local composers. In addition, Johnson began vanity publishing for others, often writing music for the lyrics of others or simply arranging others‚Äô compositions. His closest business partnership was with Fred John Adam Forster of the Forster Music Publisher, Inc. Although Johnson‚Äôs career would wax and wane with the economy of the turn of the century, World Wars I and II, and the Depression, Charles always had work and could always respond to the musical climate of the U.S. At some point in his career Johnson began writing under pseudonyms. He used Raymond Birch the most, penning several of his well-known rags under that name such as \\"Blue Goose Rag\\", \\"Melody Rag\\", and \\"Powder Rag\\". But he also used several others. Sheet music cover for Johnson's \\"Dill Pickles\\", 1906 Under any name, however, Johnson was a significant contributor to the Ragtime Era and to rag music in general. By far the biggest hit of 1906 was Charles‚Äô most successful rag \\"Dill Pickles\\". The first rag to sell a million copies was Scott Joplin‚Äôs \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\"; the second was \\"Dill Pickles\\". It has been suggested that by 1906 ragtime was already beginning to wane. After the publication of \\"Dill Pickles\\" there was a revival of interest in ragtime that extended its life by nearly ten more years. This piece of music made use of the ‚Äúthree over four‚Äù syncopation that was subsequently copied and used in dozens of rags by other composers. Joplin himself had difficulty getting away from its conventions. As mentioned before, Johnson had a remarkable ability to reflect the needs and trends of the time. A clear example of this was in his war pieces. During his musical career Charles wrote pieces for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, World War I, and World War II. Certainly most of these pieces (numbering almost 20) responded to the patriotism of U.S. soldiers in World War I. Among these pieces were \\"GoodBye Susanna\\", \\"Be a Pilgrim (And Not a Ram)\\", \\"We Will Follow the Red, White, and Blue\\", and \\"We Are All in the Same Boat Now\\".Stewart, Philip A.

Person life & career Born in Joplin, Missouri to Daniel Wenrich and Mary Ray, he left for Chicago in 1901 where he attended classes at the Chicago Musical College. Wenrich moved on to New York City around 1907 to work as a Tin Pan Alley composer, but his music retains a Missouri folk flavor. He composed at least eighteen rags, including \\"Ashy Africa,\\" \\"Noodles,\\" \\"Peaches and Cream\\" (1905), \\"Crab Apples,\\" and \\"The Smiler\\" (1907). His songs include \\"Wabash Avenue After Dark\\" and the hits \\"Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet\\" (1909, lyrics by Stanley Murphy), \\"When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose\\" (1914, lyrics by Jack Mahoney) and \\"Minnetonka\\" (1921, lyrics by Gus Kahn). \\"If It's Good Enough for Washington, It's Good Enough for Me\\" (1908, lyrics by Ren Shields) was a song about a homeless man sleeping on a bench in a public square with statues of Washington, Jefferson, McKinley, Grant and Lee. Wenrich married vaudeville performer Dolly Connolly and in 1911 wrote the hit \\"Red Rose Rag\\" for her with lyrics by Edward Madden. In 1912, Wenrich and Madden had another hit with \\"Moonlight Bay.\\" Wenrich and Connolly toured together for many years. In the late 1930s, Wenrich and several of his fellow hitmakers formed a sensational review called \\"Songwriters on Parade\\", performing all across the Eastern seaboard on the Loew's and Keith circuits.

In English, it is known as fermented black soybeans, Chinese fermented black beans (), salted black beans, salty black beans, or just black beans. They are a flavoring most popular in the cuisine of China, where they are most widely used for making black bean sauce dishes.Shurtleff, W.; Aoyagi, A History of Fermented Black Soybeans (165 B.C. to 2011). Lafayette, California: Soyinfo Center, 2011 Douchi is made by fermenting and salting black soybeans. The black type soybean is most commonly used and the process turns the beans soft, and mostly semi-dry (if the beans are allowed to dry). Regular soybeans (white soybeans) are also used, but this does not produce \\"salted black beans\\"; instead, these beans become brown. The smell is sharp, pungent, and spicy; the taste is salty, somewhat bitter and sweet. The product made with white soybeans is called mianchi. Douchi, \\"Chinese salted black beans\\", and \\"black soybeans\\" should not be confused with the black turtle bean, a variety of common bean that is commonly used in the cuisines of Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. History Fermented black soybeans are the oldest-known food made from soybeans. In 165 BC, they were placed, clearly marked, in Han Tomb No. 1 at Mawangdui Tomb Site in South Central China. The tomb was sealed about 165 BC and was first opened in 1972. The high-ranking woman to whom the undisturbed tomb belonged was probably the wife of the first Marquis of Tai. In 90 BC, in the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian, Chapter 69, refers to 1,000 earthenware vessels of mold-fermented cereal grains and salty fermented soybeans (shi). They were now an important commodity in China. When the prince of Huainan (legendary inventor of tofu) was exiled for inciting rebellion (in 173 BC) against his brother, the Han Emperor Wendi, his retinue and he were, nevertheless, provided with such necessities of life as firewood, rice, salt, shi (fermented black soybeans), and cooking utensils. This date, 173 BC, is before Han Tomb No. 1 at Mawangdui was sealed. Use Several varieties of douchi and douchi products Chicken feet dim sum with preserved black beans It is used as an ingredient for mapo tofu. Douchi is also used to flavor fish or stir-fried vegetables (particularly bitter melon and leaf vegetables). Unlike some other fermented soybean-based foods such as natto or tempeh, douchi is used only as a seasoning, and is not meant to be consumed in large quantities, being typically much saltier. Small packets of douchi are available wherever Chinese foods are sold. Some common dishes made with douchi are steamed spare ribs with fermented black beans and chili pepper (Ë±âÊ§íÊéíÈ™®), and braised mud carp with fermented black beans (Ë±ÜË±âÈØ™È≠ö). Around the world Fermented black soybeans are an ancient traditional food, used as condiments and seasonings in many Far Eastern countries and Chinese diaspora communities, where they are known by a variety of names. *In Japanese, douchi is also referred to as daitokuji natto, hamanatto, hamananatto, shiokara-natto, and tera-natto, sometimes using the same Han characters (Ë±ÜË±â), similar ones (Ë±ÜÈºì), or completely different ones; however, they are almost never known by their Chinese name. *In Korea, a similar black bean sauce made from roasted soy beans called chunjang is used in the well-known jjajangmyeon. It was first introduced by Chinese settlers in Incheon in the early 20th century; chunjang has made several changes and evolutionary steps over time. *In Vietnam, this sauce is called t√†u x√¨ or ƒë·∫≠u x·ªã and is made from the black soybean. *In Cambodia, douchi is also referred to as seang, or fermented salted bean, in the Khmer language, and is a common recipe. It is often used with the fermented salted fish prahok. *In Philippine cuisine, it is called tausi in Cebuano and Tagalog, both derived from the Lan- nang tƒÅu-sƒ´‚Åø (Ë±ÜË±â). It is often used when steaming fish. * In Cantonese- speaking regions, douchi is referred to as dau6si6 (\\"douchi\\") or hak1dau6 dau2si6 (\\"black-bean douchi\\"). *In Chinese Indonesian cuisine, it is called tausi which is derived from its Hokkien name. It is usually used in kakap tahu tausi, which is stir-fried red snapper, tofu, and douchi. *In Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America, douchi is commonly referred to as taus√≠ or tau-s√≠. *Similar African fermented products are ogiri and iru..

Ritter (born October 31, 1951, San Pedro, California) is an American novelist, short story writer, teacher, and lecturer. He has written six novels and numerous short stories spanning the historical, sports, and sociopolitical genres in the young adult field of literature. His first novel, Choosing Up Sides, published in 1998, won the 1999 International Reading Association Children's Book Award for Older Readers\\"IRA Names Award-winning Children's Books\\", Reading Today, June‚ÄìJuly 1999: 21. and was designated an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.\\"John H. Ritter\\", Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults, 2nd ed. (Florence. Kentucky: Gale Group, 2002). Kirkus Reviews praised Choosing Up Sides, which attacked the once-prevalent views of religious fundamentalists toward left-handed children, as, \\"No ordinary baseball book, this is a rare first novel.\\"Review of Choosing Up Sides, Kirkus Reviews, March 15, 1998. In 2004 Ritter received the Paterson Prize for Books for Young People for his third novel, The Boy Who Saved Baseball.Retrieved April 15, 2014. Ritter's novels have tackled subjects as diverse as the Vietnam War, the war in Iraq, the complexities of exurban land development, jazz fusion, Billy the Kid, the originations of the racial ban against African Americans in Major League Baseball, and the ascension prophecies of 2012. According to Vicki Sherbert, writing in The ALAN Review for the National Council of Teachers of English, Ritter \\"uses the game of baseball, the glory of music, and the power of the written word to illustrate how young people can overcome everyday, and not-so-everyday, challenges. Each book goes beyond the story of the game, beyond the story of the problem, right to the heart of Ritter's message: What is really valuable in life?\\"Vicky Sherbert, \\"Ahoy, You Crazy Dreamers!\\" The ALAN Review, winter 2007: 13-16. Early life Born in San Pedro, California, on October 31, 1951, novelist John H. Ritter grew up in the rural hills of eastern San Diego County. His father, Carl W. Ritter, was a sports writer, and later financial editor, for The San Diego Union newspaper. Ritter's mother, Clara, died of breast cancer, when he was four years old. Ritter recalls, \\"One thing I remember about my mom is that she sang to us constantly, making up a song for each of her four children that fit our personalities perfectly. So from her, I got a sense of how to capture a person's spirit in a lyrical phrase.\\" Writing in Dear Author: Letters of Hope, edited by Joan F. Kaywell, Ritter had this to say about his childhood. \\"When I was very young, my mother died. And my father, who deeply loved her, fell into a deep depression and began to drink heavily. After being left with four young children, my dad feared he would not be able to cope. I learned quite early that when a man drinks, he morphs into someone else. I didn‚Äôt like that drinking man. I hated the late-night arguments that filled our house, the screaming, the breaking of furniture, and the many sleepless nights I would lie in bed praying for peace, praying that my father could see the pain he was causing, how he was harming his children with his tirades, and driving the housekeepers away. In the morning, sober again, my dad would return to being the gentle, loving soul I knew him to be. And sometimes it would last all day. But never all week. Before long, I‚Äôd see his car roll up the driveway, see him climb out drunk and belligerent, and I would disappear. \\"As time went on, my dad did coach our ball teams, and we did have some great times. He even remarried. But he never stopped drinking. Eventually, his second wife divorced him. His children grew up and moved away. And my dad retired into a dark and lonely house.\\"Joan F. Kaywell, ed. Dear Author: Letters of Hope (New York: Philomel Books, 2007) 153-4. In an essay which appeared in the 2003 book Making The Match: The Right Book for the Right Reader at the Right Time for all yawl, Ritter again writes about his childhood. :\\"It was right around that time [1967] when a certain black book fell from heaven into my hands and changed my life. An amazing book‚Äîfull of crazy characters, of sadness and love, of desperation and revolution, of insight and morality. It was political and poetical, religious and surreptitious. It was a biography of the world and it was pure fiction. I was captivated by it, motivated by it, undressed, unblest, and depressed by it. All that summer, I‚Äôd been teaching myself primitive piano, had fancied myself a bluesy, outraged rock star or an actor maybe, or anyone with an audience, anyone with a voice. Then on this one particular hot, dry October afternoon, my older brother left for college and left behind his Bob Dylan Songbook. : :\\"It was long, lean, shiny, and black, a paperback, over a hundred pages full of musical notes and chords and the most surprising poetry I‚Äôd ever read. All of a sudden I had a new dream. I tore the baffle off my electric organ, cranked up the tiny Sears and Roebuck mail order amp, and sang that raggedy book from cover to cover, memorizing beat street lyrics, adopting the wail of a moaning man of constant sorrow, a tambourine man, a weather man, only a pawn, only a hobo, but one more is gone, leaving nobody to sing his sad song, and on and on. And I knew what I wanted to be. I would be the storyteller, the historian, the biographer of mixed up, dreamed up characters like these, ‚Äòwho push fake morals, insult, and stare, whose money doesn‚Äôt talk, it swears.‚Äô Or those who ‚Äòsing in the rat race choir, bent out of shape by society's pliers.‚Äô Characters with eyes, with guts.\\"Making the Match: The Right Book for the Right Reader at the Right Time, Grades 4-12 (Portland, Maine: Stenhouse, 2003) 5-7. Dylan's poems led Ritter to Jack Kerouac's On the Road, then to John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, \\"and back again somehow‚Äîwith different eyes‚Äîto Mark Twain's Roughing It. All journey books, all road poems, all the manic panic of romance and motion that a country boy needs.\\"Making the Match. After high school, Ritter attended the University of California at San Diego. There he played baseball and met his wife, Cheryl, who later became an elementary school teacher in San Diego, where Ritter worked for 25 years as a painting contractor while trying to establish himself as a writer. Writing career=Choosing Up Sides In 1994, Ritter received the Judy Blume Award and a cash grant from the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI) for a novel in progress. In 1996, he submitted his first novel, Choosing Up Sides, through Curtis Brown (literary agents), to Philomel Books, then a division of Penguin Putnam in New York, where the novel became the first acquisition of junior editor, Michael Green. Since then, Green has risen to become Editorial Director and Publisher of Philomel Books and has edited all six of Ritter's novels.Kelly Milner Halls, \\"One Voice (In a Million)\\", interview with Green, et al. 2002 Children's Writer's & Illustrator's Market, (Cincinnati, Ohio: Writer's Digest Books). Choosing Up Sides is set in southern Ohio in the 1920s. The novel's protagonist, 13-year-old Luke Bledsoe, is the oldest child of a preacher. Born left-handed, Luke is, in the eyes of his fundamentalist father, Ezekiel, a heathen and potential follower of Satan, for he believes the left hand is the hand of the devil. The authoritarian Ezekiel tries to \\"cure\\" Luke of his left-handedness, but with little luck. When Ezekiel becomes minister of the Holy River of John the Baptist Church in Crown Falls, Ohio, Luke inadvertently becomes involved with the local baseball team, which won the county championship the previous year and hopes to repeat their success. Unfortunately, in addition to viewing left-handedness as a conscious choice, \\"Pure backwards of what's right and good,\\"John H. Ritter, Choosing Up Sides (New York: Philomel) 1. Ezekiel also views baseball as a temptation that needs to be resisted, so Luke must practice pitching in secret, by throwing rocks and may apples in the woods. Early on, while Luke is watching a forbidden game, a ball lands at his feet. Throwing it back with his left hand, he amazes the crowd with both distance and placement. The ballplayers and his uncle, Micah, a sports editor for a northern Ohio newspaper, set about convincing Luke that wasting a talent such as his is the actual sin. When Luke decides to pitch for the team, a confrontation with his father ends in a violent beating, which later leads directly to the death of the father, when a crippled Luke is unable to save the man from drowning. Reviewing Choosing Up Sides, Elizabeth Bush described it in the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books as a novel that \\"pits fire and brimstone Fundamentalism against a rival religion‚ÄîBaseball‚Äîand treats both with cathartic understanding.\\"Elizabeth Bush, \\"The Big Picture\\", Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books June 1998.( Patricia K. Ladd wrote in The ALAN Review that Ritter \\"addresses themes of autonomy and independence common to young adult readers and portrays plot through authentic dialect and well- developed characters\\", and his uses of dialogue, similes, metaphors, and imagery \\"add dimensions to the plot that leave readers pondering the book's messages long after turning the final page.\\"Patricia K. Ladd, \\"Covering the Bases with Young Adult Literature\\", The ALAN Review spring-summer 2000: 10-17. Dr. Stefani Koorey in her Voice of Youth Advocates review maintained, \\"Unlike many sports novels, Choosing Up Sides does more than offer a mere glimpse of the grand old game of baseball‚Äîit takes a deeper look at faith, truth, and individuality\\", going on to dub the tale a \\"well-designed study of personal choice.\\"Dr. Stefani Koorey, review of Choosing Up Sides, Voice of Youth Advocates December 1998. For many years, Ritter painted the story the same way book critics did. The IRA Award-winning novel did indeed take a deeper look at faith. As Ritter revealed, nearly ten years later, Choosing Up Sides was actually inspired by a law passed by Colorado voters in 1992 known as Amendment 2 to the Colorado State Constitution, which prohibited enactment or enforcement of anti-discrimination protections for gay, lesbian and bisexual Coloradans. Though later declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court,Romer v. Evans Retrieved January 2, 2012 the law's enactment inspired Ritter to search for a metaphorical children's story paralleling the discriminatory amendment and the religious-based beliefs behind it.\\"John H. Ritter.\\" Something about the Author, vol. 215. (Florence. Kentucky: Gale Group, 2010). Responding to a question in a November 17, 2003, interview by Holly Atkins for the St. Petersburg Times, Ritter hints at the book's meaning: :Atkins: \\"In ‚ÄòA Note from the Author‚Äô at the end of Choosing Up Sides you write about where the idea for this novel originated. So although on one level this is a novel about a left-handed future baseball star, it's really about the larger issue of discrimination?\\" : :Ritter: \\"Yes‚Äîand religious-based discrimination, to be specific. That's the hardest prejudice to defeat, since it is delivered bearing a religious righteousness. I remember, as a boy, hearing segregation and racism being justified from the pulpit and I could not comprehend this glaring hypocrisy, totally contrary to what Jesus taught. Only later did I realize that the Bible often gets interpreted and reinterpreted in such a way as to reinforce one's own bigotry and social bias. I think it's important for children to recognize this practice as soon as possible and apply their critical thinking skills to it, since it certainly continues today.\\"Holly Atkins, \\"Baseball's Life Lessons: An Interview with John H. Ritter\\", The St. Petersburg Times November 2003. Around the year 2007, Ritter began to sense a cultural shift toward tolerance, even in the most conservative states where his books are most popular, and began testing the waters toward a public disclosure of his true inspiration. In a January 2007 interview in a newsletter published online by Brodart Books, he was asked, \\"Do you ever feel that the self-given title of ‚Äòbaseball novelist‚Äô is inhibiting, that it corners you into one genre?\\" Ritter responded, \\"This might be hard to understand, but being called a baseball novelist actually gives me a certain unique freedom among writers. I slip under the radar of an awful lot of people because of that title, and it allows me to reach an audience who would most likely never pick up a book about religious based bigotry [Choosing Up Sides] or the cowardice of war [Over the Wall] or one that demonizes anti- environmental developers [The Boy Who Saved Baseball], and so on, if I didn‚Äôt write under the cover of baseball.\\"Carrie Pauling, interview with Ritter, Broadart Books & Automation Newsletter January 2007, 10. At this point, Ritter began to openly acknowledge and discuss the metaphorical underpinnings of Choosing Up Sides in schools and conferences across the country. Over the Wall In April 2000, Ritter published his second novel, Over the Wall. Inspired by his sense of outrage at the circumstances surrounding the U.S. Gulf War in the early 1990s and the U.S. bombing of Iraq in 1998, Ritter once again adopted an historical setting in a story about a boy's attempt to reconnect with his father and discover who he is in the process, this time using the \\"festering wound\\" of the Vietnam War. \\"There are many 'walls' in 13-year-old Tyler's life: the literal wall of the baseball field he wants to clear with a mighty slam; the Vietnam Memorial Wall bearing his grandfather's name; and the invisible wall Tyler's dad has built around himself since causing the death of Tyler's sister nine years earlier.\\" \\"Beginning with the lines, 'People say time heals all wounds. I used to think so. Now I know better. Time won‚Äôt heal anything. Time is nothing but a stack of yesterdays,' Over the Wall is a study not only of one family's case of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the collective case of PTSD which Ritter believes the entire nation has suffered ever since the end of the Vietnam War. When young Tyler Waltern is invited to spend the summer in New York City with his cousin, he launches a book-length journey to find out what, if anything, truly will heal his family's wounds. Tyler is determined to make it onto the roster of an all-star baseball team. However, his explosive temper gets in the way of his obvious talent. With the help of his pretty cousin and with the sage advice of his coach, a Vietnam vet who also suffers from PTSD, the young man manages to navigate the risky waters of this passage. In this novel, Ritter parallels the parable of the Good Samaritan to show how, step by daunting step, Tyler's crippling anger dissolves into compassion for the \\"battered man\\" who was once his enemy.\\" \\"By the end\\", noted Todd Morning in a review for School Library Journal, \\"Tyler has gained a level of self-awareness by unraveling some of the tangled stories in his family's past and understanding the intricacies lying beneath the surface of life.\\"Todd Morning, review of Over the Wall, School Library Journal June 2000: 152. A Publishers Weekly reviewer wrote that Ritter \\"tackles tough subjects relating to violence in sports, religious hypocrisy, and the Vietnam War while creating layers of metaphors which neatly unfold...\\" and described the novel as a \\"powerful lesson in compassion.\\"Review of Over the Wall, Publishers Weekly 29 May 2000:83. Writing in The ALAN Review, Patricia K. Ladd noted \\"Readers are left questioning societal mores and values, rules and politics, and their own moral development,\\"Patricia K. Ladd, \\"Covering the Bases with Young Adult Literature\\", The ALAN Review Spring-summer 2000: 10-17. and Roger Leslie commented in Booklist that Over the Wall is a \\"fully fleshed-out story about compassion and absolution.\\"Roger Leslie, review of Over the wall, Booklist 1 April 2000: 1451. After publishing two completely different books in time and place, Ritter began to be noticed for his ability to switch writing style and voice at will. His editor at Philomel, Michael Green, told writer Kelly Milner Halls, in an interview on authorial voice for the 2002 Edition of Children's Writer's and Illustrator's Market, that when it comes to voice, \\"John is a true chameleon.\\" 2002 Children's Writer's & Illustrator's Market. In the wake of Over the Wall, with its strong anti-war theme, Ritter viewed America's response to the 9/11/2001 events with increasing dismay. Writing in the September 2002 volume of the California English Journal, Ritter stated, \\"The strain of this past year has been tough on me. After witnessing for days the grand, immediate outpouring of selflessness, generosity, and sacrifice in lower Manhattan‚Äîthe ‚Äòsmall friendly town of New York City‚Äô that I celebrated in my recent novel, Over the Wall‚ÄîI now sit in a blue funk, disappointed in our nation's response and the public outcry for further military retaliation. Discouraged might be a better word. I mean, why do I even bother to write books about empathy and reaching out to others, why do our teachers bother to offer lessons on the same thing, when in crisis, we hunker in survivor mode under a blanket of ethnocentrism, fear, and nationalistic fervor? Seems to me that these were the precise sentiments that drove the hijackers.\\"John H. Ritter, \\"Pacifism Is Not Passive: A Young Adult Responds to Terror\\", California English Journal September 2002: 10-11. The Boy Who Saved Baseball Ritter finally met with widespread recognition in 2003 with his third novel, The Boy Who Saved Baseball. In an admitted attempt to lift his spirits, Ritter took on the U.S. Invasion of Iraq by disguising it as an environmental issue and using a lighter and more humorous vein in a work based loosely on Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. Cited in People Magazine as a book to read, \\"Now that the youngsters have read Harry Potter...\\",\\"Spotlight on...Kids' Books\\", People Magazine 21 July 2003: 50. the story centers on Doc Altenheimer, the eccentric octogenarian owner of an apple orchard in Dillontown, California, who is preparing to sell his acres of land‚Äîincluding the town's century-old baseball field‚Äîto wealthy outside developers including a banker from Texas in cahoots with a comical and dishonest mayor. After talking with twelve-year-old Tom Gallagher, however, Doc decides to let the fate of his land rest on the outcome of a single baseball game pitting a team of local ballplayers against an all-star squad from a neighboring community. \\"Do or die,\\" Doc tells the townsfolk. \\"If our team wins‚Ä¶ the town stays the way it is. If they lose, bring on the bulldozers.\\" With the help of a mysterious newcomer, Cruz de la Cruz, Tom convinces a disgraced former major leaguer and social recluse, Dante Del Gato, to whip the Dillontown team into shape. Del Gato's character, Ritter reveals in an interview for the Baker & Taylor book distributor's newsletter, \\"was partially based on the real life tragic hero, Ken Caminiti, who was a big league MVP and batting champ in the '90s, but struggled with addictions, leaving the game under a cloud, and was dead by age 41.\\"Interview with Ritter, Baker & Taylor newsletter, Cat's Meow 28 September 2006. Once again heralding Ritter's authorial voice, a starred review in Publishers Weekly said the book's prose was \\"Enthralling...at times stunning,\\" and that, \\"Ritter delivers a baseball tale of legendary dimension, featuring several larger-than-life characters.\\"Review of The Boy Who Saved Baseball, Publishers Weekly 19 May 2003: 75. Writing in the Summer 2003 edition of The ALAN Review, editor Pamela Sissi Carroll noted, \\"This uplifting novel is a joy to read and to carry in the mind. Like Ritter's previous novels...[he] addresses the realities that trouble today's teens and the forces that shape and reshape local and national cultures. Yet John H. Ritter's game is unfailingly hopeful and encouragingly positive.\\"Pamela Sissi Carroll, Review of The Boy Who Saved Baseball, The ALAN Review spring-summer 2003: 12-13. Blair Christolon observed in School Library Journal that the work \\"is peppered with both optimism and dilemmas; it has plenty of play-by-play action, lots of humor, and a triumphant ending.\\"Blair Christolon, review of The Boy Who Saved Baseball, School Library Journal June 2003: 150. \\"Baseball in Iraq\\" Despite the reception and commercial success of The Boy Who Saved Baseball, Ritter could not shake the ever- increasing depression he felt over the suffering caused by the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and subsequent loss of civil liberties at home. He began to use writing invitations to rail against the violent turn the nation had taken. In an essay published in the Summer 2004 volume of The ALAN Review, he wrote, \\"The idealistic hopes and dreams for a better America, for a more balanced and peaceful world which guided so many of us in the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s has, in the last three years, evaporated into thunderclouds of arrogance, self-indulgence, anger, and fear.\\"John H. Ritter, \\"Are YA novelists morally obligated to offer their readers hope?\\" The ALAN Review Spring-summer 2003: 8-12. He used the invitation from editors M. Jerry and Helen Weiss, to contribute a short story to their fantasy anthology, Dreams and Vision, which examines the morality of going to war versus terrorism. The story, \\"Baseball in Iraq,\\" is a somber depiction of a newly dead American soldier facing a life review by a six-foot-tall rooster and a sympathetic Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh. Writing in The Washington Post, longtime Book World reviewer Paul di Filippo states, \\"Overall, the Weisses exhibit fine taste and editorial restraint, although...their selection of the [clich√©d] opening piece is puzzling...But then a challenging story such as John H. Ritter's ‚ÄòBaseball in Iraq (Being the True Story of the Ghost of Gunnery Sergeant T. J. McVeigh)‚Äô comes along and dispels all cant and clich√© with its elegant portrayal of the reviled terrorist working out his karma.\\"Paul di Filippo, review of Dreams and Visions: Fourteen Flights of Fantasy, Washington Post 14 May 2006. Under the Baseball Moon In a further bid to battle overwhelming personal despair, Ritter chose a somewhat autobiographical skateboarder from a musical family as the focus of his fourth novel, Under the Baseball Moon, to examine the true definition of happiness and success for an artist in the midst of a Faustian bargain: professional good fortune paid for by an overwhelming loss of spirit and joy. Reviewers reacted positively. According to a starred review in Kirkus, Under the Baseball Moon was \\"‚Ä¶a work that is far beyond the ordinary. It's about music and softball, dreams and passion, courage and loyalty and mysticism. The characters are eccentric and dynamic... Even the language is multi-layered, mixing music, sport and street talk with soaring imagery.\\"Review of Under the Baseball Moon, Kirkus Reviews 15 April 2006. In a starred review in Booklist, writer Bill Ott noted that \\"Ritter pulls out all the stops in his myth-heavy plot, but what really makes the book soar is his sense of place: the laid-back, hippie-influenced, communal spirit of OB permeates every scene, offering stark contrast to the coldly commercial world toward which Andy aspires. As in his earlier work, Ritter melds style to content beautifully, telling his story in a hip, street-smart argot that perfectly matches Andy's trumpet improvisations. Teen friendly, lots of fun, never preachy, but with plenty of thematic pizzazz,\\"Bill Ott, review of Under the Baseball Moon, Booklist 1 August 2006: 76. and a Publishers Weekly contributor noted that \\"Ritter's dialogue crackles with the rhythms of the funky California setting, and Andy's passion and ambition give the novel its heartbeat.\\"Review of Under the Baseball Moon, Publishers Weekly 8 May 2006: 66. In the novel, Andy Ramos, a skilled trumpeter who hopes to revolutionize the music scene with his band's fusion of Latin jazz, rock, and hip-hop, finds himself strangely drawn to Glory Martinez, a childhood rival and talented softball pitcher who has returned to the neighborhood. Andy and Glory soon discover that their talents peak when they perform together, but when a mysterious benefactor promises to launch Andy's musical career, he agrees to walk away from his budding romance. Asked whether there were any autobiographical characterizations in his work, Ritter said, \\"Andy Ramos, the main character in Under the Baseball Moon, is fairly autobiographical. I wrote tons of songs and dreamed of making it big in the rock world from age 15 to 22. His father, though, is closer to who I am today in his approach to life and his view of the entertainment industry's customary habit of reining in and ‚Äòbranding the maverick‚Äô of talented, rising stars whom they deem as being too far out creatively.\\"Cat's Meow. Questioning the uniqueness of the characters in the novel, the interviewer commented to Ritter that in Under the Baseball Moon, \\"Glory Martinez is a handful. It seems like she stepped out of a Joyce Carol Oates novel. Can you elaborate on why she had such a tough upbringing and still comes across with charm and drive? She is one of the more intriguing characters I‚Äôve come across in recent YA literature.\\" Ritter replied that he sees her charm \\"as being hard-won through a conscious decision she made a few years before the book begins...I know from personal experience how hard it is to grow up happy and somewhat normal in a single parent home when that parent is an alcoholic. As you get older, though, you have a choice, and it can go one of two ways. Either you become your antagonistic, anti-social parent and repeat his mistakes or, by watching and suffering through his failures, you become the opposite. Of those two choices, Glory made the healthy one, which, as you say, is quite unusual in YA literature. But kids in Glory's situation do occasionally develop a desire to dream big, coupled with the drive to succeed, and I find this rare character far more fun and interesting to write about than the typical.\\" During the 2006 Florida Council of Teachers of English Convention in Orlando, Florida, FCTE President, Dr. Virginia White, presented Ritter with the President's Award for \\"significant contribution to the teaching of English in the state of Florida\\" citing the literary value of his books and the positive impact they had on the teaching of literature in Florida schools. > The Desperado Who Stole Baseball Ritter's fifth novel, The Desperado Who Stole Baseball, set in the Wild West of the 1880s and written in the manner of a tall tale mixed with Mexican style magical realism, is a prequel to The Boy Who Saved Baseball and Book One of the Dillontown Trilogy. On his way from St. Louis to Dillontown to find his long-lost uncle, the playing-manager of a championship baseball team, twelve-year-old Jack Dillon meets Billy the Kid, who is looking for a fresh start in California. Upon his arrival, Jack learns that the Dillontown Nine have scheduled a game against the powerful Chicago White Stockings, with the town's fortune hanging in the balance. Again, Ritter's voice caused critics to react. In the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, Elizabeth Bush described Ritter's authorial voice as having \\"all the charm of a well-spun tall tale with plenty of Twainian malarkey.\\"Elizabeth Bush, review of The Desperado Who Stole Baseball, The Bulletin of the Center for children's Books April 2009. Marilyn Taniguchi asserted in School Library Journal that \\"Ritter writes in an idiom- laden, mock-epic style full of bombast and bravado...Reminiscent of Sid Fleischman.\\"Marilyn Taniguchi, review of The Desperado Who Stole Baseball, School Library Journal April 2009: 141. Of significance is the Author's Note included in the paperback edition (Puffin 2010) revealing Ritter's inspiration. The \\"Desperado\\" of the title is not Billy the Kid, but a Major League Baseball owner, William Hulbert, who along with Albert Spalding and Cap Anson, added impetus to the movement to \\"steal\\" baseball from African American players, a little known fact in baseball lore, yet one Ritter believed showed a character even more nefarious: \\"Others would also tend to downplay baseball's racial divide, as personified by the management of these Chicago White Stockings (later to become the Chicago Cubs). I was not about to do that, having worked on the manuscript from early 2007 to June 2008, paralleling the launch and quixotic presidential quest of a mixed-race U.S. Senator and dedicated Chicago White Sox fan. And yes, as I note, Long John Dillon did stand up once and say, \\"For the first time in my life, I am proud to be a part of this land.\\"‚Äîa sentiment I heard echoed across this beautiful nation repeatedly as I penned this tome. And in those moments I found hope and grace.\\"John H. Ritter, The Desperado Who Stole Baseball (New York: Puffin, 2010) 260. Among critics, the book received virtually no comments alluding to the novel's racial thrust. Only Ian Chipman, reviewing the work in Booklist, noted that The Desperado Who Stole Baseball provided \\"a good child's eye introduction to baseball's segregated past.\\"Ian Chipman, review of The Desperado Who Stole Baseball, Booklist 15 February 2009: 82. Fenway Fever Ritter's sixth novel, Fenway Fever, a book his publisher describes as \\"another magical novel that celebrates teamwork‚Äîand the innate power to heal that even the least among us is born with,\\" is scheduled to be released on April 12, 2012, to coincide with the 100 year anniversary of Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts.Penguin Books for Young Readers Catalog for Spring of 2012, printed in 2011. Ritter is currently working on a utopian novel, 2020 Vision, premised on the changes American society must go through after a floodgate of top-secret disclosures occur upon the release of undisputed evidence of U.S. Government participation in the events of September 11, 2001.

They grow on disturbed land, roadsides, arable land and pastures.Altervista Flora Italiana, genere Onopordum includes photos and distribution maps for several species They are biennials (rarely short-lived perennials) with branched, spinose winged stems, growing 0.5‚Äì3 m tall. In the first season they form a basal rosette of gray-green felted leaves and rarely a few flower heads. In the second season they grow rapidly to their final height, flowering extensively, and then die off after seed maturation.Flora of China Vol. 20-21 Page 159, Â§ßÁøÖËìüÂ±û da chi ji shu Onopordum Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 827. 1753. The leaves are dentate or shallowly lobed to compound with several pinnatifid or deeply cut leaflets, and strongly spiny. The terminal flower head is typical for thistles, a semi-spherical to ovoid capitulum with purple (seldom white or pink) disc florets. There are no ray florets. The receptacle is glabrous with dentate margins. The tube of the corolla is slender, sac-shaped and symmetrical. The anthers have awl-shaped outgrowths on the top. The capitula have several overlapping rows of leathery basal simple linear-lanceolate spines. These are smooth to slightly pubescent. These plants propagate only by seed. The seed heads mature in mid-summer, releasing their seeds. The fruit is a glabrous achene, 4‚Äì6 mm long and with 4-50 ribs. The pappus consists of many rows of simple, fine to minutely rough hairs, united in a circular base. Onopordum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora onopordiella (feeds exclusively on O. acanthium). In the Greek island of Crete a native species called agriagginara (Œ±Œ≥œÅŒπŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ±) or koufoti (Œ∫ŒøœÖœÜœâœÑŒøŒØ) has its heads (flowers) and tender leaves eaten raw by the locals. ; Species * Onopordum acanthium L. - Cotton thistle, Scotch thistle, Scotch common-thistle, heraldic thistle, woolly thistle Onopordum acanthium - habit - widespread across Europe and temperate Asia * Onopordum acaulon L. \\\\- Stemless thistle, horse thistle - France, Spain, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia * Onopordum alexandrinum Boiss. \\\\- Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Jordan * Onopordum algeriense (Munby) Pomel \\\\- Algeria * Onopordum ambiguum Fresen. \\\\- Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Jordan * Onopordum anatolicum (Boiss.)

Though primarily a social organization, its members pride themselves on their affiliations to the life sciences and agricultural sciences. Founding The fraternity considers the Morrill Act of 1862 to be the instrument of its inception. Having been signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, it provided land and other financial supports to establish one institution of higher learning in the agricultural and mechanical sciences within each state. Alpha Gamma Rho, referred to as \\"AGR\\", was founded when two local fraternities from Ohio State University (Alpha Gamma Rho, founded 1904) and the University of Illinois (Delta Rho Sigma, founded in 1906) met at an International Livestock Competition in Chicago. Sixteen men originally signed the fraternity's charter at the Claypool Hotel in Indianapolis on April 4, 1908. Expansion increased dramatically over the next three decades to almost all land-grant universities in the country. The first chapter at a non-land-grant university was chartered in 1958 at Arizona State University. The first non-state (private) associated chapter (Beta Psi) was at Delaware Valley University in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The four pillars of Alpha Gamma Rho are recruitment, commitment, education, and recognition. These four pillars, built upon a firm foundation, support and maintain the integrity of our brotherhood. One of AGR‚Äôs earliest Grand President‚Äôs, S.K. Bjoronson (North Dakota) said, \\"I want her men to be leaders of the future, not because they are my Fraternity Brothers, but because I believe them to be the strongest of character and the most honorable and resolute of the times. I want each of them, by their deeds and actions, to justify the existence of Alpha Gamma Rho.\\" The Brotherhood Covenant pillars make up the principles that Alpha Gamma Rho brothers are expected to live by. Once initiated, each member is required to sign the Covenant.

Beginning near the southeastern end of Summit Lake in the Alaska Range, the river flows generally south to meet the larger river northeast of Glennallen. The Richardson Highway and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline run north- south, nearby and roughly parallel to the Gulkana River. Slightly south of Summit Lake the river passes under the east‚Äìwest Denali Highway near its junction with the Richardson Highway at Paxson. \\"Wild\\" segments A total of of streams in the Gulkana River watershed were designated \\"wild\\" and added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System in 1980. This included the of the main stem between Paxson Lake and Sourdough. The other designated segments included the north and south branches of the West Fork Gulkana River, the West Fork itself, and the Middle Fork Gulkana River from Dickey Lake to the fork's mouth on the main stem. The federal Bureau of Land Management administers the \\"wild\\" river segments and their surrounds. Recreation The Gulkana River watershed, which includes many clearwater lakes and streams, \\"has one of Alaska's most productive and popular grayling fisheries...\\", according to Alaska Fishing. Accessible by highway, airplane, boat, and foot trails, the Gulkana system supports large populations of king and red salmon, rainbow trout, and lake trout as well as Arctic grayling. The river flows through wild country affording views of the Wrangell Mountains. Visitor services are available along the Richardson Highway. The main stem and some of its tributaries are popular with boaters of various skill levels. Depending on which segments are being run, floats on these streams vary from Class I (easy) to IV (very difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. A float trip down the main stem of the Gulkana may take four or five days Trips starting on the forks may take much longer, depending on the chosen route. Put-in and take-out places along the main stem from source to mouth include Paxson Lake, Paxson Lake Campground, Sourdough Campground, Poplar Grove Campground, and the Richardson Highway Bridge at Gakona. Floats on the Middle Fork Gulkana River usually start at the Delta National Wild and Scenic River Wayside along the Denali Highway and include lake segments and portages near the headwaters. It is also possible to take a floatplane to Dickey Lake and start from there. The West Fork Gulkana River and its two branches are also runnable but difficult to reach and navigate. In particular, portages on the South Branch route, which includes lakes and a segment of the Tyone River, are \\"arduous\\". Hazards on these streams include Canyon Rapids, rated Class III to IV (difficult to very difficult) on the main stem, isolation, cold water, logjams, overhanging or submerged vegetation, portages of varying difficulty, and powerboats on the lower river.

His deep, resonant voice has also been featured in many commercial advertisements and movie trailers. One critic wrote that \\"you may not know Ken Nordine by name or face, but you'll almost certainly recognize his voice.\\"  Life and career  The son of Theresia (Danielson) and Nore S. Nordine, a contractor, Ken Nordine was born in Cherokee, Iowa. His parents were Swedish. The family later moved to Chicago, where he attended Lane Technical College Prep High School and the University of Chicago. During the 1940s, he was heard on The World's Great Novels and other radio programs broadcast from Chicago. One of which, Honore de Balzac's short story \\"Une passion dans le d√©sert\\", was recorded for the 1955 album Passion in the Desert. In 1955, he provided the voiceover on Billy Vaughn's version of \\"Shifting Whispering Sands\\", which peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. He subsequently attracted wider attention when he recorded the aural vignettes on Word Jazz (Dot, 1957). Love Words, Son of Word Jazz (Dot, 1958) and his other albums in this vein feature Nordine's narration over cool jazz by the Fred Katz Group featuring Chico Hamilton recording under an alias.Weber M., The CODA Interview with Fred Katz, CODA The Jazz Magazine, Issue 176 (1980) Nordine began performing and recording such albums at the peak of the beat era and was associated with the poetry-and-jazz movement. However, it has been observed that some of Nordine's writings \\"are more akin to Franz Kafka or Edgar Allan Poe\\" than to the beats. Many of his word jazz tracks feature critiques of societal norms. Some are lightweight and humorous, while others reveal dark, paranoid undercurrents and bizarre, dream-like scenarios. Nordine's DVD, The Eye Is Never Filled was released in 2007. Nordine hosted the weekly Word Jazz program on WBEZ, also carried on other stations, from the 1970s for over forty years. Nordine was in demand as a voiceover artist on commercials for several companies including the First Chicago Bank, Levi's, Gallo Wine and Magnavox amongst others. In 1988, Nordine appeared on two selections from the album Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films: the opening track, \\"Hi Diddle Dee Dee (An Actor's Life For Me)\\" from Pinocchio, and the second to last track \\"Desolation Theme\\", also from Pinocchio\\". In 1990, Nordine was approached by Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead to be the anchor for their New Year's Eve radio broadcast from Oakland, California. For the broadcast he recorded some improvisations with Garcia, drummer Mickey Hart and Egyptian musician Hamza El-Din. This subsequently led to an album Devout Catalyst, released on the Grateful Dead's own label in 1991 and Upper Limbo in 1993 and appearances with the band such as their show at Rosemont, Illinois, in March 1993. In 2007, he was a performer at the High Line Festival in New York, curated by David Bowie. With his wife, the former Beryl Vaughn, an actress whom he married in 1945, he had three sons. Beryl died April 26, 2016. Ken Nordine died February 16, 2019. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Ken Nordine among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.  Films and television  Nordine appeared as the narrator, credited as \\"The Stranger\\", in Philip Kaufman's 1967 underground comedy Fearless Frank. He was also Linda Blair's vocal coach for her role in the 1973 film The Exorcist. Subsequently, Nordine filed a lawsuit, saying he was not properly compensated for his work, eventually settling in 1979. Nordine narrated several films for classroom use, made by Coronet Instructional Films in the 1950s. In at least one, Developing Your Character, he appears on screen. On television, Nordine did a series of readings on a show titled Faces in the Window on WNBQ, and Fred Astaire danced to Nordine's \\"My Baby\\" on a TV special. Nordine's past radio series were Now Nordine and Word Jazz. He also provided the opening narration for the music video of \\"Can You Feel It\\" by the Jacksons. Nordine worked with author Maurice Sendak on Sesame Street, providing the narration for the animated segments \\"Bumble Ardy\\" and \\"Seven Monsters\\". Nordine provided the voiceover for NewTek's Video Toaster demo reels, such as the 1991 \\"Revolution\\".

It begins in the Ogilvie Mountains north of Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. From there it flows north through the community of Old Crow, veers southwest into the U.S. state of Alaska, and enters the larger river at Fort Yukon. It derives its name from the Gwich'in word for the river, Ch'oonjik, or \\"Porcupine Quill River\\". The Porcupine caribou herd, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) Alaska, gets its name from the river. The oldest (but disputed) possible evidence of human habitation in North America was found in a cave along one of its tributaries, the Bluefish River. Many apparently human-modified animal bones have been discovered in the Bluefish Caves. They have been dated to 25,000 to 40,000 years old by radiocarbon dating--several thousand years earlier than generally accepted human habitation of North America. Boating The Porcupine River offers the possibility of \\"an excellent novice river trip for those experienced in remote wilderness travel,\\" according to author Karen Jettmar. Boaters can travel by canoe, kayak, or raft, though rafters may have difficulty with upriver winds. A float trip beginning at Summit Lake in the Yukon Territory, descending the Bell River to its confluence with the Porcupine, and continuing to Fort Yukon is all rated Class I (easy) on the international scale of river difficulty. However, in high water the difficulty may rise to Class II in Upper and Lower Rampart canyons, downstream of the international border, where the current is swift.

It is also used in Indian cuisine, Tamil cuisine, where it is known as karuppu kaaramani and in Maharashtrian cuisine, where it is known as Kala Ghevada. The black turtle bean is often simply called the black bean (frijoles negros, zaragoza, jud√≠a negra, poroto negro, caraota negra, or habichuela negra in Spanish; and feij√£o preto in Portuguese), although this terminology can cause confusion with other black beans. Background The black bean has a dense, meaty texture, which makes it popular in vegetarian dishes, such as frijoles negros and the Mexican- American black bean burrito. It is a very popular bean in various regions of Brazil, and is used in the national dish, feijoada. It is also a main ingredient of Moros y Cristianos in Cuba, is a required ingredient in the typical gallo pinto of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, is a fundamental part of Pabell√≥n criollo in Venezuela, and is served in almost all of Latin America, as well as many Hispanic enclaves in the United States. In the Dominican Republic cuisine, it is also used for a variation of the Moros y Cristianos simply called Moro de habichuelas negras. The black turtle bean is also popular as a soup ingredient. In Cuba, black bean soup is a traditional dish, usually served with white rice. The bean was first widely grown in the present-day United States after the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), however, initially the variety was primarily grown as a snap pea (for the edible seed pod).

Early life Friday was born in Dublin and grew up in Ballygall, a neighbourhood located on Dublin's Northside located between Finglas and Glasnevin where he went to school. When he was fourteen years old and living on Cedarwood Road, he met Bono and Guggi at a party to which he had not been invited. Bono said: \\"We caught him trying to steal something of the house. Classic teenage stuff... but we became friends.\\" Career He was a founding member of the post-punk group The Virgin Prunes and has recorded several solo albums and soundtracks. In 1986, after the demise of Virgin Prunes, Friday devoted himself to painting for a while, sharing a studio with Bono, Guggi and Charlie Whisker. This resulted in the exhibition Four Artists ‚Äì Many Wednesdays (1988) at Dublin's Hendricks Gallery. Friday, Guggi and Whisker showed paintings, while Bono opted to exhibit photos taken in Ethiopia. Friday's part of the show was entitled I didn't come up the Liffey in a bubble, an expression often used by Friday's father. His main collaborator between 1987 and 2005 was multi-instrumentalist, Maurice Seezer. They signed to Island Records in 1988 and released three albums together, before parting with the company in 1996. Since then Friday and Seezer composed the score for the Jim Sheridan films The Boxer and In America which was nominated for Best Original Film Score in the 2004 Ivor Novello Awards. He has maintained a close friendship with U2's Bono since both were children, and they collaborated on the soundtrack for the Jim Sheridan film In the Name of the Father, including the title track, \\"Billy Boola\\" and \\"You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart\\", which was sung by Sin√©ad O'Connor and nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. In 2003 they wrote \\"Time Enough for Tears\\", the original theme tune for Sheridan's film In America, as sung by Andrea Corr. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 1995 he performed \\"Look What You've Done (To My Skin),\\" one of two songs (the other sung by P.J. Harvey) written by Philip Ridley and Nick Bicat for Ridley's second feature film as writer and director, The Passion of Darkly Noon. In 2005 Friday and Seezer collaborated with Quincy Jones on incidental music for the 50 Cent biopic Get Rich or Die Tryin'. In 2001 they scored the film Disco Pigs by Kirsten Sheridan. Two years later Friday and Seezer and their ensemble also collaborated with Bono on Peter & the Wolf in aid of the Irish Hospice Foundation. In September 2006 a 2-CD collection of sea shanties called Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys, produced by Hal Willner, was released on the ANTI- label. Friday contributes to two tracks including the lewd \\"Baltimore Whores\\" and \\"Bully in the Alley\\" with ex-Virgin Prunes bandmates Guggi and Dave-id. The reunion of Friday, Guggi and Dave-id was the first time they had recorded together since the Virgin Prunes broke up in 1985. Friday worked again with Hal Willner in June 2007, appearing in the concert \\"Forest of No Return ‚Äì the Vintage Disney Songbook\\" as part of the Meltdown Festival presented at London's newly reopened Royal Festival Hall. Sharing a stage with artists such as Grace Jones, Nick Cave, Pete Doherty and curator Jarvis Cocker, Friday performed the Disney songs \\"The Siamese Cat Song\\" and \\"Castle in Spain\\". Taking time out from work on his fourth solo album with Herb Macken, Friday teamed up with English composer, Gavin Bryars, the Royal Shakespeare Company and Opera North for a new interpretation of Shakespeare's Sonnets touring as part of the 2007 Complete Works Festival. Opening in Stratford-Upon-Avon, Friday presented his take on Sonnet 40 ('Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all') and narrated Bryars' 40-minute piece 'Nothing Like The Sun'. Friday and Macken composed the music for the Patrick McCabe play, The Revenant. The Revenant opened as part of the 2007 Galway Arts Festival. The play's main theme is entitled 'Dreamland'. In 2009, Friday and Macken worked on Gavin's fourth studio album, set for release in 2010. On 6 April 2010 Record company Rubyworks announced they signed Gavin Friday and that a new album is on its way. The new CD is titled catholic and was released in Ireland on Good Friday: 22 April 2011. Acting Friday's first acting experience was in the Kirsten Sheridan film Disco Pigs (2001), in which he played a bit part. In 2005 Gavin Friday played Billy Hatchett in the Neil Jordan film Breakfast on Pluto based on Irish author Patrick McCabe's book, which had been influenced by Friday's album Shag Tobacco. On the soundtrack he sings \\"Wig Wam Bam\\" and \\"Sand\\", a duet with Cillian Murphy.

Other regular members include vibraphonist Bill Ware, bassist Brad Jones and drummer E. J. Rodriguez; the group has often featured a violinist (Rob Thomas, Jim Nolet or, more recently, Sam Bardfeld).

Recently the Passengers have recorded infrequently as a full ensemble, though the individual bandmembers' recent side projects tend to feature many fellow Passengers, as well as a similarly skewed musical sensibility.

The game features 16-color EGA graphics and IMF AdLib compatible music. It was developed by Frank Maddin and Gerald Lindsly. The game is divided into three episodes. The first episode of the game is available to download under a shareware license, but the two remaining parts of the game must be purchased. The registered game also removes advertisements and reminders of the benefits of purchasing the games from the first episode and enables cheat code functionality. The game was re-released in 2014 on GOG.com with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Plot The player controls Johnny Dash, whose pet dog Tex was just dognapped by the game's main villain, Count Chuck. Aided by the friendly Bed Monster and Frank Lloyd Rat, Johnny enters the Underworld armed with a slingshot and an infinite supply of rocks to slay Count Chuck and his minions and rescue his beloved Tex, as well as many more captured pets. Gameplay Johnny fighting a zombie Johnny must work his way through a total of 28 horror-themed levels. Throughout the levels, Johnny can collect candy for points, interact with objects and pickup various powerups. The three difficulty modes determine how many health points Johnny has. Any monster, enemy projectile or hazard that Johnny touches will deduct a health point from him. Health is replenished by collecting a heart. Certain hazards and deadly terrain will instantly kill Johnny and take a life away. Up to five lives can be regained by collecting a voodoo doll or earning 20,000 points. If all lives are lost, the game is over. In each level the player has to release all pets from their cages, before making it to the exit to proceed to the next level. When entering a new level, all powerups are removed and Johnny's health is fully replenished. The player comes across various inanimate objects which they must interact with in order to complete the level. These include furniture that springs Johnny into the air, deployable ladders and flying broomsticks. At one point in each episode, Johnny will face his \\"Nemesis\\", a doppelganger of himself as a minor boss. At the end of an episode, the player must defeat a boss monster. Johnny has an unlimited supply of rocks, and he can fire his slingshot either forward or diagonally up. Rocks move in a realistic projectile-like pattern, and can bounce off walls and other objects. As well as killing enemies, the player can also use the slingshot to position objects. The player can collect powerups for the slingshot that allow Johnny to shoot a limited quantity of more powerful projectiles, including larger rocks, missiles, and fireballs. Enemies are based on horror-monsters, and include disembodied crawling hands, flying witches, zombies, demons, walking skeletons and werewolves. While some enemies appear in several levels, others only appear in theme-related levels. Some enemies take more hits to die than others, and a couple are invincible. Release Monster Bash was the first shareware game Apogee developed to take up a Megabyte of disk space. To cater for users with slower modems and better commercialize the game, Apogee created a cut down version titled \\"Monster Bash Lite\\". Reception Monster Bash's three episodes were reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #200 by Sandy Petersen in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.

Biography John Wesley Jarvis (great, great nephew of Methodist leader John Wesley), was born at South Shields, England. His father was an English mariner, who moved his family to the United States in the mid-1780s. The Jarvis family settled in Philadelphia; there he spent his childhood and began his artistic training. He is known to have frequented the studio of the aging colonial-era portrait painter Matthew Pratt and he knew the Danish painter Christian Gullager. His formal instruction began around 1796, when he became apprenticed to Edward Savage. He also spent times with David Edwin, an English engraver also employed by Savage. Jarvis moved to New York in 1801 with Edward Savage. Within a year he was working on his own as an engraver. In 1803 he entered into a partnership with Joseph Wood. His partnership with Wood lasted seven years. Together they executed engravings, miniatures, and larger portraits. Jarvis had learned the technique of miniature painting from Edward Malbone; and by the time of the Jarvis/Wood partnership, he was also producing his first oil paintings. In addition, he operated a drawing school and executed inexpensive silhouette portraits. In New York City he enjoyed great popularity, though his conviviality and eccentric mode of life affected his work. He visited Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans, entertaining much and painting portraits of prominent people, particularly in New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson was one of his sitters. Isaac Collins, the New York City printer, became a favorite subject for Jarvis to sketch a portrait of in 1806. He had for assistants at different times both Thomas Sully and Henry Inman. He affected singularity in dress and manners, and his mots were the talk of the day. Lafitte Brothers in Dominique You's Bar, attributed to John Wesley Jarvis (c. 1821, oil on wood panel) In 1809, Jarvis married Betsy Burtis (who died four years later in 1813, leaving him with two children). He parted with his family in order to seek portrait commissions in Baltimore. Although he made occasional trips back to New York, he remained in Baltimore for several years. While New York always remained his home base, he continued his habit of extended residences in other cities for most of the rest of his life. During the 1820s and 30s, for example, he sought work in South Carolina, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Washington, Virginia, Ohio, and Georgia. His apprentice, Henry Inman, probably accompanied him on these trips until his term of service ended in 1822.American Art Gallery Organization Jarvis rose to the top of his profession by 1814, when he took over an unprecedented commission for six full-length portraits of the naval heroes of the War of 1812 for the City of New York. (Gilbert Stuart had given up the important project after a dispute with the patrons). For over a decade, he remained the premier portrait painter in New York, with important ties to the political, mercantile, and cultural elite. Jarvis was also something of a social outsider, known for his ostentatious dress, flippant manner, and propensity to consume alcohol. He was celebrated as a hilarious storyteller, and his ties to the theater world were many. As early as the 1820s, however, he received some personal setbacks. In 1823 he was sued successfully by his apprentice John Quidor for breach of contract, and the following year he lost custody of his children in a court battle with his estranged second wife. A decade later, in 1834, he suffered a debilitating stroke while in New Orleans. Partially paralyzed and mentally incapacitated, he spent the rest of his life in New York City, cared for by his sister. He died there in 1839, in poverty. Examples of his painting are in the collections of the New York Historical Society, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

B108 and Magic 108 The station was sold to a group calling itself KTWN-FM, Inc., with the new owners immediately switching the station's format to a soft adult contemporary and oldies hybrid on September 24, 1983.http://www.radiotapes.com/documents/KWTN.pdf .Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1984 page B-135 The call sign became KGBB (\\"B108\\"). Later, the station became \\"Magic 108\\" with the call letters KMGW (later KMGK). The station's signal limitations were a hindrance, with competition from full- market stations such as WLTE and KSTP-FM. In the mid-1980s, KMGK got permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to become a full- signal station, increasing power to 100,000 watts on a tower more than 1,000 feet in height above average terrain (HAAT), making the station's signal equal to other major Twin Cities FM stations. In 1988, KMGK was acquired by Trumper Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1990 page B-164 KQQL On September 30, 1988, KMGK began stunting with a loop of various versions of the 1960s oldie \\"Louie, Louie.\\" At Noon on October 3, the station was reborn as KQQL \\"Kool 108.\\" While some FM stations had oldies as part of their playlists, KQQL was the first all-oldies FM station in the Twin Cities area. The first song on \\"Kool 108\\" was \\"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\\" by Danny & the Juniors. The oldies format originally spanned the era of the early days of Rock 'n Roll Music of the mid 1950s through the late 1960s. In the mid-1990s, some 70s hits were added. By 2000, the 1950s hits were removed, and the station shifted to hits of the 1960s and 1970s (with an occasional early 1980s song thrown in). For a brief time, KQQL was the FM flagship station for Minnesota Vikings football, with games being simulcasted with co-owned sports radio station KFAN. Clear Channel ownership In 1997, KQQL was acquired by the Chancellor Media Corporation.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-232 Three years later, Chancellor was merged into Clear Channel Communications, based in San Antonio.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-282 (In 2014, Clear Channel changed its corporate name to iHeartMedia, Inc.) In the early 2000s, KQQL began switching to Christmas music during the holiday season. It would usually begin on the Friday before Thanksgiving at 5 p.m and conclude at midnight on Christmas Day. KQQL would compete with CBS-owned adult contemporary station 102.9 Lite FM until WLTE flipped to country music in December 2011, which ended its Christmas music tradition. In 2008, KQQL started the Christmas music earlier than usual, on the weekend of November 15. This may have been triggered by Lite FM flipping its format earlier in the week. KQQL's format was tweaked again in 2006, to an oldies/classic hits hybrid, positioned as \\"Super Hits of the 60s & 70s.\\" Some 1980s hits were also included. Kool 108 also began airing \\"American Top 40\\" episodes from the 1970s hosted by Casey Kasem. For a short time, Kool 108 also aired classic 1980s American Top 40 shows, but the station dropped the AT40 '80s broadcasts after the station cut back on playing '80s music. On April 28, 2009, KQQL released all on-air personalities, including morning host Lois Mae and radio veteran Dan Donovan. Disk jockeys on KQQL were voicetracked from other Clear Channel stations, with news coming from KOA in Denver. However, in mid-2010, KQQL hired several new on-air personalities, including radio veteran and KARE-TV 11 reporter Lee Valsvik. On December 27, 2009, the station tweaked to a classic hits format and dropped most 1960s titles while adding some 1990s songs, with a primary focus on 1970s and 1980s hits. Direct competition with Cumulus Media's WGVX (Love 105) ended when that station switched formats to adult contemporary music in early 2012. At this time AT40: The 80s returned, and Dick Bartley's Classic Countdown was added to the lineup. In January 2019, KQQL slightly tweaked its format and officially dropped all music from the 1960s, and many hits from the 1970s while also adding some 2000s music. The station's format now primarily focuses on music from the 1980s and 1990s. In addition, the Classic Countdown was replaced with America's Greatest Hits with Scott Shannon. HD Radio=HD2 On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel Communications announced that KQQL's HD2 subchannel would carry a format focusing on hit music from the 1980s. The HD2 station, called Kool 1-0-80s, showcased every song to ever hit the Top 40 in the 1980s. During summer 2011, the HD2 subchannel changed its programming to a simulcast of AM all-sports sister station KFXN. On September 8, 2011, the \\"Score\\" sports format began airing exclusively on KQQL-HD2. The Score's former signal on 690 AM flipped to ethnic programming, mainly serving the Hmong community. In August 2012, the HD2 subchannel was changed back to \\"Kool 1-0-80s,\\" now using iHeartRadio's \\"My 80s\\" service, with many of the same 1980s hits format it had before. On May 23, 2014, KQQL-HD2 flipped to urban adult contemporary, and began simulcasting on FM translator W227BF (93.3 MHz), licensed to Shoreview, Minnesota.93.3 Minneapolis Changes Soon after, it started stunting with several types of music, changing every few days. On June 13, 2014, KQQL-HD2 changed to an alternative rock format, branded as \\"ALT 93.3\\".ALT 93.3 Debuts in Minneapolis On June 29, 2020, 15 iHeart stations in markets with large African-American populations, including W227BF/KQQL-HD2, began stunting with African-American speeches, interspersed with messages such as \\"Our Voices Will Be Heard\\" and \\"Our side of the story is about to be told,\\" with a new format slated to launch on June 30. On June 30, it was made official that W227BF/KQQL-HD2 would be a charter affiliate of iHeart's new Black Information Network, which is an all-news format specifically geared toward African-American listeners. HD3 Around the same time, KQQL's Kool 1-0-80s format moved to KQQL's HD3 channel, feeding FM translator W244CS at 96.7 MHz, licensed to Calhoun Beach.Radio-Locator.com/K244FE The translator serves the Southeast metro area of the Twin Cities. On June 12, 2015, KQQL-HD3 and W244CS changed to an LGBTQ- centric dance/EDM format from iHeartRadio, branded as \\"96.7 Pride Radio.\\" On August 27, 2018, KQQL-HD3 and K244FE dropped the Pride Radio format and flipped to all-sports as \\"KFAN Plus.\\"KFAN Plus Debuts in Minneapolis Radioinsight - August 27, 2018 Pride Radio now is heard on the HD-3 subchannel of co-owned KDWB.

Galvin Parkway in Phoenix, central Arizona. Founded by the Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society in 1937Deborah A. Starr, \\"Desert Botanical Garden\\", Horticulture, March 1994:48-54. and established at this site in 1939, the garden now has more than 50,000 plants, in more than 4,000 taxa, one-third of which are native to the area, including 379 species, which are rare, threatened or endangered. Of special note are the rich collections of agave (4,026 plants in 248 taxa) and cacti (13,973 plants in 1,320 taxa), especially the Opuntia sub-family. Plants from less extreme climate conditions are protected under shadehouses. It focuses on plants adapted to desert conditions, including an Australian collection, a Baja California collection and a South American collection. Several ecosystems are represented: a mesquite bosque, semidesert grassland, and upland chaparral. Desert Botanical Garden has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride. History In the 1930s, a small group of local citizens became interested in conserving the fragile desert environment. One was Swedish botanist Gustaf Starck, who found like-minded residents by posting a sign, ‚ÄúSave the desert,‚Äù with an arrow pointing to his home. In April 1934 they formed the Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society (ACNFS) to sponsor a botanical garden to encourage an understanding, appreciation and promotion of the uniqueness of the world's deserts, particularly the local Sonoran Desert.Rhys Lee A shining beacon of conservation: The Desert Botanical Garden Arcadia News Oct 1, 2019 Eventually Gertrude Webster, whose home encompassed all of what is today the neighborhood of Arcadia, joined the Society. She offered her encouragement, connections and financial support to establish the botanical garden in Papago Park. Margaret Bell Douglas provided support as well, donating 1,500 specimens to the herbarium. Webster served as president of the Society's first Board of Directors and Gustaf Starck, W. E. Walker, Rell Hasket, L. L. Kreigbaum, and Samuel Wilson were the five vice president. The latter also served as Treasurer. Paul G. Olsen was Secretary. In 1938, after much work by the ACNFS, the board hired the Garden's first executive director, George Lindsay, who oversaw the first planting on the grounds. The Desert Botanical Garden opened in 1939 as a non-profit museum dedicated to research, education, conservation and display of desert plants.  Education & Art  The Garden offers specialized tours, workshops and lectures on desert landscaping and horticulture, nature art and photography, health and wellness . The Garden presents Spring and Fall open-air acoustic concert series, art exhibitions, and Las Noches de las Luminarias since 1978. The Luminarias Festival became a Southwestern Holiday tradition featuring live music by the flickering lights of 8000 hand-lit luminaria. Volunteerism Volunteers were essential in the Garden's creation and development, when the staff was small and finances tight. These early supporters, including a few amateur botanists who donated their own plant collections, helped plan and execute plant sales, photography and art exhibits, and numerous public events. Volunteers remain a Garden asset, sharing their time, talents and professional expertise. They work closely with staff to maintain the Garden's status as a premier plant research institution and serve as members of the Board of Trustees, setting policy and governing the Garden.

It was first published by Games Workshop in 1983 and the game designers were Gary Chalk and Ian Livingstone. Gameplay Each player has one or more \\"battlecars\\" that are equipped with machine guns, flamethrowers, spike droppers and the like, with much taken from the cinematic James Bond mythology of modified vehicles. The simple game mechanics allowed for quick and entertaining game play, with damage being marked off using card counters. The game was too simple for some more mature players, given its relatively basic rules and lack of capacity to design unique vehicles. It is possible that the game was intended to capitalise on the popularity at the time of Car Wars game published by Steve Jackson Games. The game was not successful and has been forgotten by the general public. The production values of the game, however, were higher than those of the early versions of Car Wars. History One expansion set for this game was released, Battlebikes, introducing motorcycles and also handling some errata. A licensed Swedish language version of the game was published by Target Games under the name Combat Cars. In the autumn of 1984, Games Workshop released Battlecars as a computer game for the ZX Spectrum. It was written by SLUG (a Harlow co-operative of ex-programmers from Red Shift).\\"From Tin Soldiers to Computer Games\\"; CRASH issue 9, October 1984; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition It was launched alongside two other Games Workshop titles, D-Day and Tower Of Despair. Later in the '80s Games Workshop released a new product named Battlecars, however this was for an expansion box of car models for their separate road-based wargame of Dark Future and was not connected to, or compatible with, the original game. Reception Chris Baylis reviewed Battlecars for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"if you like mentally blowing away the guy who cuts you up on the motorway, then Battlecars will help you gain revenge and relieve the tension, without alerting the local constabulary.\\" Ian Waddelow reviewed Battlecars for White Dwarf #52, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that \\"Battlecars is abstract, yet this is to its advantage. If you want quick, simple and fluid action, take a look at Battlecars.\\" Craig Sheeley reviewed Battlecars in Space Gamer No. 71. Sheeley commented that \\"Battlecars is an admirable boardgame, a simple wargame. But compare its limited movement and combat, its scanty number of options in auto selection, and tis price to the somewhat more-complex but free movement and combat and bewilderingly large vehicle selection (including design-your-owns) in Car Wars, which retails for less than one-third the money. It's not likely that Battlecars is going to oust Car Wars for the number one position. However, if what you want is a simple, elegant game of auto-combat with a high price tag, then you might consider Battlecars. I'll stay with Car Wars.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #18 (Dec 1983) NotesSee also *Dark Future - a subsequent miniature-based car battle game by Games Workshop.

Outler is generally considered to be one of the most important Wesley scholars in the history of the church as well as the first real United Methodist theologian. He was also a key figure in the 20th-century ecumenical movement.  Biography  Outler was born and raised in Georgia and was an ordained Methodist elder who served in several appointments. He graduated from Wofford College and received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Yale University, teaching at both Yale and Duke University before beginning a long tenure at Southern Methodist University in Texas. He was a delegate to Consultation on Church Union, served on the Faith & Order board of the World Council of Churches and was an official observer at the Second Vatican Council.  Theological contribution  Outler is widely credited with being the first to recognize John Wesley's method for theologizing, via what Outler referred to as the Wesleyan Quadrilateral: scripture, church tradition, reason, and personal experience. This understanding of Wesleyan theology is prevalent throughout Methodism, particularly in the United Methodist Church. Using this model, Outler was a key figure in organizing the theological statement put forth by the United Methodist Church after its formation in 1968. With his many references to the early church, Outler's work has proven very influential to those in the paleo- orthodox movement and contemporary evangelicalism, notably Thomas C. Oden.

It opened as the park's fifth roller coaster on July 18, 2015. Freestyle originally opened at Canada's Wonderland in 1985 as SkyRider and closed in 2014. Built by TOGO, it was the second stand-up roller coaster from the company following the now-defunct King Cobra, which opened the previous year at Kings Island. On August 6, 2014, Canada's Wonderland announced that the ride would close permanently on September 1, 2014. The coaster accommodated nearly 23 million guests during its lifespan. In the Fall of 2014, SkyRider was sold, dismantled and relocated overseas to Cavallino Matto. It was reassembled and opened in 2015 as Freestyle. Yukon Striker, a Bolliger & Mabillard Dive Coaster, is currently located in the space vacated by SkyRider.  SkyRider Memories Contest  In August 2014, Canada's Wonderland announced it would be holding a special contest for thrill seekers before the ride's official retirement. The contest was held on Canada's Wonderland official Twitter page under the banner \\"SkyRiderMemories\\", where 24 lucky winners were invited to have the final ride on SkyRider before its official closing on September 1, 2014 at 8pm. The winners were also given one of SkyRider's roller coaster wheels to keep as a souvenir. Similar rides While SkyRider was relocated in 2014, King Cobra was put in storage at sister park Kings Island before the start of the 2002 season and eventually scrapped in 2008. Freestyle is the second oldest stand-up roller coaster in operation., RCDB Shockwave at Kings Dominion had a similar track layout until the second camelback hill, where instead of a trick track and a turn to the right, the ride immediately turned to the left and went over one bunny hill before entering the brake run. As the last TOGO stand up and the oldest Stand Up in North America, Shockwave closed on the 9th of August, making room for Delirium, a HUSS Giant Frisbee. In Japan, the Pink Typhoon Standing Coaster at Washuzan Highland also has a similar layout to Freestyle until after the second camelback hill, where the trip back to the brake run is shorter and does not feature a banked section of straight track. Unlike Freestyle, only one of the two trains used on Star Jet has riders standing up. The second train is a standard TOGO sit-down train that has rider's facing backwards throughout the ride.

In his works, he often treats the notion of \\"culture\\" skeptically, focusing as much on how it is used as on what it means. Background Kuper was the son of Simon Meyer Kuper and Gertrude Hesselman. He was raised in Johannesburg and attended Parktown Boys' High School. He took his first degree at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. His doctorate, from the University of Cambridge, was based on field research in the Kalahari desert in what is now Botswana. After graduation he returned to Africa, doing further fieldwork in Botswana and Uganda. The sociologist Leo Kuper and anthropologist Hilda Kuper were his uncle and aunt. He married Jessica Cohen (1944-2013) of Johannesburg in 1966 and taught from 1967 to 1970 at Makerere University in Kampala. From 1970 to 1976 he taught at University College London. From 1976 to 1985 he was professor of African anthropology at Leiden University in the Netherlands. From 1985 to 2008 he was a professor at Brunel University, where he was the first head of the Department of Human Sciences, and latterly head of the Anthropology Department. In 2000 and in 2007 he was, respectively, awarded the Rivers Memorial Medal and the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Kuper was a Visiting Professor at Boston University, 2011‚Äì14, and a Centennial Professor, London School of Economics, from 2013-14 where he still holds a visiting appointment.Personal correspondence He has lived in Muswell Hill for over 25 years. The football writer Simon Kuper is his son. Research In the early 1970s Kuper did fieldwork in Jamaica, on attachment to the National Planning Agency in the Office of the Prime Minister. However his main ethnographic focus continued to be the societies of Southern Africa, on which he has published several books. In 1973 he published a history of British social anthropology, and since then he has continued to study and publish on the intellectual history of anthropology, most recently a book on the idea of culture in the anthropological tradition. He was awarded a Leverhulme Major Research Grant for two years (2003-5) which allowed him to spend more time on research. The topic was cousin marriage and incest in nineteenth century England. He has supervised many PhD students on Southern African ethnography, history of anthropology, family business, and kinship. Retirement dispute In January 2009 it was revealed that Brunel had reneged on an agreement to let him stay until 2010. Instead, he was forcibly retired in late 2008, just after the census date for publications submitted to the Research Assessment Exercise had passed. Kuper responded by suing the university for breach of contract. In 2011, employment laws were changed to permit phased retirements past the age of 65. This was because of changes to the 2006 Employment (Age) Regulations making mandatory retirement imposed by the employer unlawful.

Former park owner Paramount Parks collaborated with HUSS Park Attractions to design and manufacture the ride, which opened as on April 5, 2002. The flat ride featured a variety of special effects that correlated with the theme of the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider from Paramount Pictures. Under new ownership by Cedar Fair, Kings Island removed all references to the film from both the ride and its indoor queue line following the 2007 season. It reopened as The Crypt in 2008. An outdoor, smaller version of the ride opened at sister park Kings Dominion in 2005 as Tomb Raider: FireFall. History During the 2000 season, Kenton's Cove Keelboat Canal, a log flume water ride, gave its last ride. For the beginning of the 2001 season, the area around Kenton's Cove Keelboat Canal was fenced in, with the phrase, \\"An exciting new adventure is coming in 2002\\" written along the fence. Paramount's Kings Island officially announced Tomb Raider: The Ride on July 2, 2001, by placing the Hindu goddess Brahma prop used in the first movie (and later, in the ride's pre-show) in front of the park's Eiffel Tower and Royal Fountains. After the Paramount Parks were sold to Cedar Fair and all licensing rights were dropped, the rides within the park continued to operate with the Paramount movie names for the 2007 season. However, on January 21, 2008, Kings Island's main web site replaced the name Tomb Raider: The Ride with The Crypt. The ride cost approximately $20 million to build, making it one of the most expensive rides the park has ever constructed. The Crypt was the world's first and only Giant Top Spin, performing two inversions in a cycle that lasted 1:10.  Ride experience = Tomb Raider: The Ride (2002‚Äì2007)  The entrance and queue line when it was known as Tomb Raider: The Ride In the attraction's Tomb Raider: The Ride incarnation, the attraction's entry plaza featured a special edition Land Rover Defender parked by the ride's entrance to represent Lara Croft's presence at the site. Atmospheric music (some sampling the movie's score) played throughout the plaza and into the queue. Upon entering the building, guests found themselves walking on catwalks over artifacts and rubble while passing under ceilings supported by a seemingly temporary bamboo structure. A large antechamber, featuring large stone monkey warrior statues from the film, sectioned off one cycle's worth of guests into three rows. As the ride's original score intensified, ancient gears could be heard tumbling into place as a light aligned to illuminate the Triangle of Light featured on the elaborately-carved door located in front of riders. Once the light is aligned, the door began to slide open with accompanying sound and fog effects, allowing guests to enter the pre-show room. Once in the pre-show area, the door would slide closed. The pre-show room featured the statue of Brahma used in the film and a large oval projection screen that raised out of the altar beneath the statue. A video played to explain the foundation of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, establishing the ride's storyline to be centered around the Triangle of Light, an ancient artifact capable of controlling time, which is sought by Croft in the film. Once the pre-show video had ended, the entire left wall of the room rose, revealing the \\"secret\\" entrance to the sixty-foot- tall altar chamber of the god Shiva and allowing riders to board the vehicle, maintaining the same rows from the prior room. The ride featured an original soundtrack composed by Rob Pottorf, sound effects from The Bakery, and voiceovers from Angelina Jolie, along with other members of the film's cast. The ride lifted riders up toward the eyes of a carving of Shiva on the forward wall. His eyes (embedded with automated lights) scanned the car, and fire and ice emblems held in two of his six hands illuminated. The ride then flipped through the darkness before stopping with riders looking straight up at razor- sharp icy stalactites on the ceiling. It released, flipped again, and came to a stop, holding riders looking straight down on \\"lava pits\\", pools of water cascading from a massive volcano stretching up the chamber's back wall. In time with the music, the lava would begin to jump up, as fountains narrowly avoided splashing riders. After another flip through the darkness, the ride circled around the bottom of its arc, looking up at the god on the wall. As fog and lights filled the room, the fire and ice effects went off at once as, in time with the audio track, the god screamed and her fire, ice, and eyes went dark. He appeared to \\"wake up\\" once more as one final blast of fog emanated from the base of the ride structure, nearly contacting riders before fading away (this used as a device to keep riders engaged during the ride's lengthy homing procedure before the bridges could lower to allow guests to disembark). For the majority of its time as Tomb Raider: The Ride, the ride included four inversions, extended \\"hang time\\" over the lava pits, a god with piercing eyes and fire and ice emblems, fog effects, and a synchronized musical score composed specifically for the ride, lasting 2:30. The Crypt (2008‚Äì2011) In June 2006, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company purchased all five Paramount Parks from Viacom. After the 2007 season, the parks removed all references to Paramount and their licensed film properties from rides and attractions. At Kings Island, this led to a change in the name of Tomb Raider: The Ride which became The Crypt. The name change coincided with a change in theme, as many film aspects of the original ride were removed. The Shiva goddess statue in the Heart of the Tomb, a feature in the line queue, was painted over. The ride's water and fog effects were also removed. The Giant Top Spin's 77-seat gondola was reduced in size with the removal of the first row of seats, reducing the capacity by one third. The ride performed a nine- inversion cycle like its sister ride at Kings Dominion for the 2008 season and for a month of the 2009 season. Beginning in 2009, the ride was reprogrammed to perform a less intensive cycle with only two inversions ‚Äì half the number previously performed when it was known as Tomb Raider: The Ride. The Crypt was changed and updated several more times over the years. Following its operation in 2008 with a techno soundtrack in complete darkness, the soundtrack was changed to howling wind and beating drums. Gradually, more of the theatrical lighting used on Tomb Raider: The Ride returned to the ride. The queue line, which had its Tomb Raider: The Ride musical score removed earlier, began playing an album of atmospheric music from the Midnight Syndicate until 2011, when both the queue and ride were outfitted with music from the score of the film Inception. Also in 2011, new lighting and props were added to the queue line, and manual doors were retrofitted in place of the original \\"vault door\\" that would raise and lower to let riders in. In the middle of the season, the red, amber, and yellow underwater lights that formerly illuminated the \\"lava pit\\" were turned back on, and would stay illuminated throughout the ride. In addition, blue lights were installed on the goddess statue and would begin flashing as the gondola reversed direction halfway through the ride cycle. The Crypt gave its last ride October 30, 2011. The following year on January 20, 2012, The Crypt was removed from the park's website without explanation. Park officials confirmed the following month on Twitter that The Crypt \\"has reached the end of its service life\\", and that it would \\"be replaced by an all-new Halloween Haunt experience\\". Halloween Haunt Attraction (2012‚Äìpresent) The Crypt has been transformed into Madame Fatale's Cavern of Terror. This attraction is themed to a museum of oddities and wax. Design The show elements for Tomb Raider: The Ride were designed by Technifex, a special effects company specializing in themed entertainment. Scenic design was handled by Weber Group with lighting designed by Visual Terrain. The soundtrack was composed by Rob Pottorf of RPMusic while The Bakery handled sound design.

The Crypt is a higher-capacity version of the highly popular smaller Top Spin located at many amusement parks. Initially, Tomb Raider: The Ride accommodated 77 riders. When it was rebranded The Crypt, its capacity was reduced to 46 (by removing the first row of the gondola).

He was a man of limited education and had no gift as a debater or speaker, but he was a skillful organizer. (His first name has occasionally been spelled Jedidiah or Jedadiah in the literature.) An outspoken opponent of the John Adams administration and the Federalist Party in New York State, Peck was arrested by Federalist Judge William Cooper for circulating a petition against the Adams-era Alien and Sedition Acts and taken to jail in chains; massive protests from Peck supporters and opponents of the administration won his release without trial. Biography Peck was born in Lyme, Connecticut, one of thirteen children of Elijah Peck and Hepzibah Pierson. He was raised on the family farm, and his formal education was limited to attending a country grammar school, but he taught himself by reading the Bible many times over. In 1771 at about age 23, Peck returned from a sea voyage to learn that his parents, three brothers and a sister had died. He became extremely depressed and wrote in his journal that he longed for: > Days and times past when may father and Mother and all my bretherin and > Sisters were about me in helth and prosperity but alas! trubel and Sorow > hath Sorounded me and I am a poor Disconsolate Cretur. There is no place > that Seemes to be home to me. He kept that journal in a secret drawer in his desk throughout the remainder of his life, and from that time he became quite evangelical about his faith. He served four years as an enlisted man in the American Revolutionary Army. In 1790 he settled in what was to become the town of Burlington, Otsego County, New York. When Burlington was formed from a part of the Town of Otsego in 1792, Jedediah Peck became Burlington's first Town Supervisor and remained in that job for eight years. He is said to have been elected to the position three times, the latest in 1820, when he would have been 73. He also worked as a surveyor and millwright, studied law, was appointed as a judge, wrote political tracts, and conducted religious services on request. He is said to have been seen as an awkward figure, with his \\"drawling, nasal, yankee twang\\" and his saddle-bags \\"filled with political papers and scraps\\" that he distributed to all who would listen. Peck was a strong anti-Federalist, and in 1798, Judge William Cooper, an ardent Federalist, had him arrested by a United States Marshal under the Alien and Sedition Acts for circulating petitions against those very acts. Peck was taken in irons to be tried in New York City. The spectacle of the martyred war hero being transported in chains only served to help the Republican cause. Peck was soon released without trial. He was a member of the New York State Legislature for eleven years, in the Assembly (1798‚Äì1804) and in the Senate (1804 to 1808). Father of the Common School System of New York State While in the State Assembly (in 1801, 1803 and 1804), Jedediah Peck sponsored bills to establish common schools in the state, but each resolution was rejected. In 1811, after Peck's retirement from active politics, Governor Daniel D. Tompkins appointed Peck chairman of a five-man commission to study the problem of public school education. In five months the commission reported the fundamental principals of New York's educational system. In 1812, a bill become law and the basic foundation of the state's public school system was established. The law requires: *that there be a division of towns into school districts; *that there be trustees in each district to superintend those schools; *that each town raise taxes as much as it received from the state school fund; *that the funds be divided among the various towns on a population basis, and then subdivided among the school districts. In addition to his work in establishing the common school system of New York, he introduced a bill for the abolition of imprisonment for debt which later became a law. Although nearly seventy years of age at the time, he served in the War of 1812, and took part in the Battle of Queenston Heights. He died at age 74 and is buried at the in the Town of Burlington, New York. A New York State Historical Marker at the site reads: > In memory of Hon. Jedediah Peck, a Revolutionary Patriot, who died Aug 15, > 1821, in the 74th year of his age. The annals of the State bear record of > his public usefulness and the recollection of his virtues bear testimony of > his private work. References *History of Otsego County, New York 1740-1878: Ch.

The management team and much of the original development team came from Evans & Sutherland, bringing their 3D graphics and software engineering skills into the video game industry. Its most famous titles were the Twisted Metal and Jet Moto video game series. The company's first two games, WarHawk and Twisted Metal, were major critical and commercial successes, leading publisher Sony Computer Entertainment to contract two further games from SingleTrac. SingleTrac had ambitions of becoming a video game publisher as well as developer, and in early 1997 signed a deal with Microsoft to enable them to publish PC games, but these plans never came to fruition. Later in 1997 SingleTrac signed on as a developer for the Nintendo 64, but they ultimately never produced any Nintendo 64 games. After producing the two contracted games for Sony Computer Entertainment, SingleTrac was bought by the video game publisher GT Interactive, which was then bought by the French company Infogrames. The SingleTrac studio was closed down in 2000. Lineage A group of SingleTrac employees broke off and formed the game studio Incognito Entertainment in 1999, and went on to make some additional entries in the former SingeTrac franchise Twisted Metal and a sequel to SingleTrac's first game WarHawk, both for Sony Computer Entertainment. In 2009 most of the team members left Incognito to form Eat Sleep Play and LightBox Interactive rendering Incognito defunct. Both studios would go on to develop the same two former SingleTrac franchises Incognito made entries in - Eat Sleep Play developed a PS3 entry in the Twisted Metal series and LightBox Interactive developed a spiritual successor to the Warhawk series, Starhawk.

Neighboring municipalities *Akita Prefecture **Daisen **Yokote *Iwate Prefecture **Nishiwaga Demographics Per Japanese census data,Misato population statistics the population of Misato peaked at around the year 1960 and has been in steady decline since then. Climate Misato has a Humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa) with large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is heaviest from August to October. The average annual temperature in Misato is 14.3 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall is 1743 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.3 ¬∞C, and lowest in January, at around -3.8 ¬∞C.Misato climate data History The area of present-day Misato was part of ancient Dewa Province, dominated by the Satake clan during the Edo period, who ruled Kubota Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The area was organized into six villages within Semboku District, Akita with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The village of Rokug≈ç was raised to town status in 1891. The town of Misato was established on November 1, 2004, from the merger of the towns of Senhata and Rokug≈ç, with the village of Sennan. Economy The economy of Misato is based on agriculture and forestry. Rice is the primary cash crop. Industries are centered around food processing, with sake brewing and fermented foods made from soybeans such as natto, miso, and soy sauce predominant. Education Misato has three public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town has one public high school operated by the Akita Prefectural Board of Education.

This gives the latter as functions of the exogenous variables, if any. In econometrics, the equations of a structural form model are estimated in their theoretically given form, while an alternative approach to estimation is to first solve the theoretical equations for the endogenous variables to obtain reduced form equations, and then to estimate the reduced form equations. Let Y be the vector of the variables to be explained (endogeneous variables) by a statistical model and X be the vector of explanatory (exogeneous) variables. In addition let \\\\varepsilon be a vector of error terms. Then the general expression of a structural form is f(Y, X, \\\\varepsilon) = 0 , where f is a function, possibly from vectors to vectors in the case of a multiple-equation model. The reduced form of this model is given by Y = g(X, \\\\varepsilon) , with g a function. Structural and reduced forms Exogenous variables are variables which are not determined by the system. If we assume that demand is influenced not only by price, but also by an exogenous variable, Z, we can consider the structural supply and demand model : supply: Q = a_S + b_S P + u_S, : demand: Q = a_D + b_D P + c Z + u_D, where the terms u_i are random errors (deviations of the quantities supplied and demanded from those implied by the rest of each equation). By solving for the unknowns (endogenous variables) P and Q, this structural model can be rewritten in the reduced form: : Q = \\\\pi_{10} + \\\\pi_{11} Z + e_Q, : P = \\\\pi_{20} + \\\\pi_{21} Z + e_P, where the parameters \\\\pi_{ij} depend on the parameters a_i , b_i, c of the structural model, and where the reduced form errors e_i each depend on the structural parameters and on both structural errors. Note that both endogenous variables depend on the exogenous variable Z. If the reduced form model is estimated using empirical data, obtaining estimated values for the coefficients \\\\pi_{ij}, some of the structural parameters can be recovered: By combining the two reduced form equations to eliminate Z, the structural coefficients of the supply side model (a_S and b_S) can be derived: : a_S = (\\\\pi_{10}\\\\pi_{21} - \\\\pi_{11}\\\\pi_{20}) / \\\\pi_{21} , : b_S = \\\\pi_{11} / \\\\pi_{21} . Note however, that this still does not allow us to identify the structural parameters of the demand equation. For that, we would need an exogenous variable which is included in the supply equation of the structural model, but not in the demand equation. The general linear case Let y be a column vector of M endogenous variables. In the case above with Q and P, we had M = 2. Let z be a column vector of K exogenous variables; in the case above z consisted only of Z. The structural linear model is : A y = B z + v, where v is a vector of structural shocks, and A and B are matrices; A is a square M √ó M matrix, while B is M √ó K. The reduced form of the system is: : y = A^{-1}Bz+ A^{-1}v = \\\\Pi z + w, with vector w of reduced form errors that each depends on all structural errors, where the matrix A must be nonsingular for the reduced form to exist and be unique. Again, each endogenous variable depends on potentially each exogenous variable. Without restrictions on the A and B, the coefficients of A and B cannot be identified from data on y and z: each row of the structural model is just a linear relation between y and z with unknown coefficients. (This is again the parameter identification problem.) The M reduced form equations (the rows of the matrix equation y = Œ† z above) can be identified from the data because each of them contains only one endogenous variable.

Originally from Hungary, he has lived in the United Kingdom for most of his life after coming to the country as a refugee at the age of eight. Szirtes was a judge for the 2017 Griffin Poetry Prize. Life Born in Budapest on 29 November 1948, Szirtes came to England as a refugee in 1956 aged 8. After a few days in an army camp followed by three months in an off-season boarding house on the Kent coast, along with other Hungarian refugees, his family moved to London, where he was brought up and went to school, then studied fine art in London and Leeds. Among his teachers at Leeds was the poet Martin Bell. His poems began appearing in national magazines in 1973, and his first book, The Slant Door, was published in 1979. It won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize the following year. In 2000, British composer Jane Sinclair Wells used his text for her work Air Kissing. He has won a variety of prizes for his work, most recently the 2004 T. S. Eliot Prize, for his collection Reel, and the Bess Hokin Prize in 2008 for poems in Poetry magazine. His translations from Hungarian poetry, fiction and drama have also won numerous awards. He has received an Honorary Fellowhsip from Goldsmiths College, University of London and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of East Anglia. He also won the Poetry and the People Award in Guangzhou, China in 2016. Szirtes lives in Wymondham, Norfolk, having retired from teaching at the University of East Anglia in 2013. He is married to the artist Clarissa Upchurch, with whom he ran The Starwheel Press and who has been responsible for most of his book jacket images.

Arminius, the Cheruscan noble and military leader, had married Thusnelda, Segestes' daughter, against her father's will. As a result, Segestes, who favoured Roman overlordship, bore an ongoing grudge against Arminius. In 9 AD he warned the Roman governor Publius Quinctilius Varus of the impending uprising of his countrymen, but he was not believed.Tacitus, The Annals 1.55 Varus and his three legions subsequently perished in the three-day Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where several allied German tribes under the command of Arminius ambushed them. Segestes openly turned against Arminius when Germanicus invaded northern Germany in 15 AD in a renewed attempt to establish Roman rule in the area. Besieged in his stronghold by his own countrymen, Segestes appealed for help to Germanicus whose forces relieved the siege, and Segestes then handed over his pregnant daughter Thusnelda, Arminius' wife, to Germanicus as a prisoner.Tacitus, The Annals 1.57 Thusnelda was taken to Rome and, together with her brother Segimundus, displayed in Germanicus' victory parade in 17 AD, with her father as an honoured spectator. Thusnelda never returned to her homeland. Arminius' only son, Thumelicus, whom she bore while in captivity, was trained as a gladiator in Ravenna and is considered to have died in a gladiator fight before reaching the age of 20. In 21 AD, Segestes and other members of his family killed Arminius. Segestes was eventually given a residence by Germanicus in a Roman province west of the Rhine. References The most important historical source about Segestes is Tacitus, Annals, 1, 55-59. The Roman historians Velleius Paterculus, Florus, and Cassius Dio also mention him.

Eliot Prize for Poetry is a prize that was, for many years, awarded by the Poetry Book Society (UK) to \\"the best collection of new verse in English first published in the UK or the Republic of Ireland\\" in any particular year. The Prize was inaugurated in 1993 in celebration of the Poetry Book Society's 40th birthday and in honour of its founding poet, T. S. Eliot. Since its inception, the prize money was donated by Eliot's widow, Mrs Valerie Eliot and more recently it has been given by the T S Eliot Estate. The T S Eliot Foundation took over the running of the T S Eliot Prize in 2016, appointing Chris Holifield, formerly director of the Poetry Book Society as its new director, when the former Poetry Book Society charity had to be wound up, with its book club and company name taken over by book sales agency Inpress Ltd in Newcastle. At present, the prize money is ¬£20,000, with each of nine runners-up receiving ¬£1500 each, making it the United Kingdom's most valuable annual poetry competition. The Prize has been called \\"the most coveted award in poetry\\". The shortlist for the Prize is announced in October of each year On the evening before the announcement of the Prize, the ten shortlisted poets take part in the Readings at the Royal Festival Hall in London's Southbank. 2000 people attended the 2011 reading.

She was created as a replacement for Supergirl in post-Crisis on Infinite Earths Legion continuity. She was also inspired by elements of Superman's supposed descendant Laurel Kent (who, in post-Crisis, pre-Zero Hour continuity, was revealed to be a Manhunter android). Fictional character biography=Pre-Zero Hour Following her death in the Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series, Supergirl was removed from mainstream DC continuity, endangering the status of every Legion story featuring the Girl of Steel. Following the events of Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #4-5 (February‚ÄìMarch 1990), the sorceress Glorith supplants the Time Trapper as reality's master of time manipulation, resulting in several alterations in Legion continuity. In the new timeline, the 30th century native Laurel Gand replaces 20th century native Supergirl in Legion history; all of Kara Zor-El's appearances are said to have been appearances by Laurel. The pre-Zero Hour Laurel was similar to the pre-Crisis Supergirl in that she was a distant relative of the Glorithverse's Superboy analogue, Valor, and was born on an asteroid called Ricklef II (as opposed to the Krypton remnant Argo City). Also, upon arriving on Earth she had posed as a shy, bookish young woman with glasses. As a child, Laurel fought off a Khundian attack force threatening to invade Daxam (the planet of her ancestry), but not before the Khunds slaughtered her parents and other inhabitants of the Ricklef II research station. Living in exile on Earth and fearing further vengeance from the Khunds, Laurel jumped at the chance to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. Where the pre-Crisis Supergirl had been romantically linked to Brainiac 5, so too was Laurel Gand. However, Laurel and Brainy eventually parted ways, and after the \\"Five Year Gap\\", it was revealed (much to Brainiac's dismay) that Laurel had married Rond Vidar and borne a daughter, Lauren. Laurel spent her years away from the Legion, singlehandedly beating Khundian forces back from the United Planets systems, and rejoined the reunited Legionnaires when her husband Rond disappeared while on a mission to rescue Mysa Nal (the White Witch) from Mordru the Merciless. Laurel proved a tremendous asset to the new Legion during the war against Earthgov and the Dominators. When the mysterious \\"Batch SW6\\" doppelg√§nger Legion appeared, the younger SW6 Laurel soon distinguished herself from her adult counterpart by taking on the codename \\"Andromeda\\" and wearing a colorful gold-and-black costume. It is unknown whether the adult Laurel ever used \\"Andromeda\\" (or any other codename) during her own youth in the Legion. The adult Laurel stayed with her Legion when it was forced to go underground to fight corruption in the Science Police. Tragically, Laurel was killed by a terrorist bomb during one of the renegade Legion's early missions. Shortly thereafter, Laurel, her younger self, and the rest of the Legions were erased from history, following the Zero Hour reboot. Post-Zero Hour Laurel Gand spent most of her early life in a xenophobic Daxamite White Triangle community, being indoctrinated in the \\"horrors\\" of interspecies co-operation before the Triangle's political clout led her to become the Daxamite representative in the Legion. Away from Daxam's red sun, she gained powers similar to Superman's, but the race-wide hypersensitivity of Daxamites to lead meant that even minuscule amounts could prove fatal, even to a powered-up Daxamite, forcing her to wear a transuit at all times. This did not trouble her, since it meant she never had to actually touch any non-Daxamites. Her Triangle-derived beliefs hampered her effectiveness as a Legionnaire, thanks to her reluctance to physically engage with any enemies, but the real problems started after she let several Triangle members go free after a mugging, shortly after which they beat and almost killed Triad. Angered more for their defiance of her than for the beating, when she was ordered away to prevent the Composite Man gaining her powers, she flew after them. Immediately, they tore her transuit and directly exposed her to lead, and she barely managed to turn them over to the Science Police before crashing through the walls of Legion HQ. While Brainiac 5 worked on devising an anti-lead serum, he confronted her about her beliefs. After discovering the serum which Vril Dox II, his direct ancestor, had created for Valor and tailoring it to her genetic structure to allow it to work properly on her (much to her surprise, as she had been taught that all members of the same race were identical), Brainiac 5 forced her to confront the fact that he wasn't her inferior before giving her the serum. While this was happening, however, Shrinking Violet discovered a White Triangle necklace in her room and connected it to the group which had assaulted Triad and destroyed Trom, telling the rest of the team. Confined to quarters after an unsuccessful attempt by Cosmic Boy to have her removed from the team, she used her super- senses to see Ambassador Roxxas gloating, but he managed to bully her into giving him the anti-lead serum. Taking it himself and giving it to four other Daxamites, they proceeded to cause mass destruction on Earth. When Andromeda herself confronted Roxxas over what he was doing and had made her do, she was almost defeated when Violet began thrashing around in his head, before coming out and telling Andromeda to take him down. As she pummelled him repeatedly, he destroyed the covering of an \\"atomic furnace\\", and both were thought to have died in the resulting inferno (causing Brainiac 5 severe depression). Only Cosmic Boy was told that she had survived and voluntarily exiled herself to Planet Hell. Later, she was brought out of this exile by Live Wire, after Cosmic Boy had told him where she was as part of a way to build up a \\"Legion Rescue Squad\\", and she was awed by Valor (who later called himself M'onel), himself being another member. However, she declined to rejoin the Legion after the Squad had served its purpose, preferring to head off into deep space. She eventually joined a religious convent. After the events of Infinite Crisis, Earth-247, the home of the Post-Zero Hour Legion, was destroyed. Andromeda appears in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds, battling Superboy-Prime along with M'onel (Valor) and Superman. Later, in the fifth issue, her pre-Zero Hour younger and older counterparts are called to battle the Time Trapper, alongside dozens of other Legionnaires from alternate realities. She survives the battle and leaves with the 247 Legion to try to rescue more survivors from destroyed universes. Powers and abilities Generally, the abilities of Laurel Gand (and other Daxamites) are identical to those of Superman and other natives of the planet Krypton (super-strength; speed; flight; X-ray, heat, microscopic or telescopic vision powers; invulnerability and super hearing), with three major exceptions: 1\\\\. She is vulnerable to the inert element lead, instead of the radioactive element Kryptonite. 2\\\\. Lead poisoning is fatal to Daxamites, and Laurel is kept alive only through ingestion of anti-lead serum, such as the one modified by Brainiac 5. 3\\\\. In her two pre-\\"Zero Hour\\" incarnations, the radiation of a red star would not rob Laurel of her powers, as it would with most Daxamites and Kryptonians. In other media In Superman: The Animated Series, Andromeda made a cameo appearance in the episode \\"New Kids In Town\\". Andromeda appears with Legion of Super-Heroes in Justice League Adventures (the comic book adaptation of the modern Justice League animated series) #28\\\\. She is shown as the girlfriend of Brainiac 5.

She is the second U.S. Navy ship to be named for Carter Hall, an estate near Winchester, Virginia, built in the 1790s. Carter Halls keel was laid down on 11 November 1991 by the Avondale Shipyards at New Orleans, Louisiana. The ship was launched on 2 October 1993 and commissioned on 30 September 1995. As of January 2019, Carter Hall is homeported at JEBLC, Virginia, and assigned to Amphibious Squadron Four. Overview The mission of the Landing Ship Dock (LSD) is to transport and launch amphibious craft, vehicles, crews and embarked personnel in an amphibious assault. An LSD can also render limited docking and repair service to small ships and craft, and act as the Primary Control Ship (PCS) during amphibious assaults. Carter Hall is a Cargo Variant (CV) of the . A significant difference between the two classes is that Carter Halls well deck has been shortened from to . This provides Marines with added vehicle and cargo storage areas. The well deck can hold two Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC) and a variety of landing craft and tracked amphibious assault vehicles. Carter Halls two-spot flight deck can land and service any helicopter in the Navy and Marine Corps inventory. History=1990s Carter Hall and her plankowner crew departed on their first six-month Mediterranean deployment on 29 April 1997. Her crew completed a UNITAS/WATC Deployment from 24 July 1999 until 15 December 1999. 2000s In 2001, Carter Hall deployed to the Mediterranean Sea from 15 April to 15 October 2001. On 2 June 2007, Carter Hall engaged pirates after they boarded the Danish ship off the coast of Somalia. The LSD destroyed three small boats being towed behind the captured vessel, but was unable to pursue after the vessel entered Somalian waters. 2010s On 13 January 2010, Carter Hall was ordered to assist the humanitarian efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. On 31 October 2012, Carter Hall was sent towards the Hurricane Sandy impact area in case the United States Navy was needed to support the disaster relief efforts. In April 2016, one of Carter Halls sailors died after falling overboard from the ship. Navy and Coast Guard units searched for the sailor, but to no avail.  2020s  On , Navy Times reported that a Navy spokesperson confirmed that \\"[s]everal crew members\\" assigned to Carter Hall had tested positive for COVID-19 on . The spokesperson declined to provide an exact number of sailors, citing Defense Department policy, but added that those infected were \\"being checked on each day by their leadership [and] receiving deliveries of food and essential items\\". At the time, the ship was docked at its home base.https://seapowermagazine.org/cleaned-after- covid-19-detection-amphib-carter-hall-awaits-crews-return Most of the roughly 400 crew members were brought ashore while the ship was being sanitized. Ship's coat of arms The colors of the field red, white, and blue, stand for the United States. The saltire recalls the heritage of the South in the history of Carter Hall in Millwood, Virginia. The anchor represents the Navy. The times are in the form of pheons, symbolizing the mission of support to assault operations. The loose rope intertwined with the anchor signifies freedom. The border denotes unity. Dark blue and gold are the colors traditional associated with the Navy; red for courage, white for integrity. The griffin denotes courage and vigilance. The crown refers to the heritage of Carter Hall, recalling the Great grandfather of its builder, known as \\"King\\" Carter. The battle stars of the first are commemorated by the arc of battle stars, five gold for her service in Vietnam. The motto is underscored by the olive branch for peace and the oak for war. Gold is for excellence and red for courage.

Fictional character biography Like Legion founder Cosmic Boy, Dyrk Magz was born on the planet Braal, and possessed a high level of the power over magnetism that is natural to all Braalians. He was the first candidate to distinguish himself at the tryouts held by the Legion in Legionnaires #43; although acting leader Live Wire was reluctant to recruit a replacement for Cosmic Boy, who was at the time stranded in the 20th century, Dyrk's quick thinking and willingness to take action earned him a place in the Legion and the codename Magno. Power loss However, his service in the Legion was short-lived. After successfully deterring several rejected applicants' attempt at re-opening the newly filled membership slots, Magno and the other two new recruits, Sensor and Umbra, joined the rest of the Legion in battling Mordru. During the Legion's first encounter with the sorcerer, Magno saved Live Wire's life, but the team was unable to prevent the destruction of the planet Sklar. In the following climactic battle, although Live Wire was able to protect Magno from an energy surge which killed Workforce member Blast-Off, in the aftermath Dyrk's powers of magnetism were entirely gone. Dyrk chose to return home to Braal, but found that control over magnetism was taken for granted by native Braalians and was a constant reminder of his loss. None of the many specialists he saw there were able to reverse or even explain the loss of his powers. Eventually Live Wire was able to convince him to return to the Legion by offering the newly finished Outpost Allon as a sort of neutral ground. After the time-lost Legionnaires returned from the 20th century, Dyrk volunteered to stay on as part of the Outpost's support staff, handling monitor duty and the administration of the Outpost. In this capacity, Dyrk remained with the Legion for some time, appearing only periodically to pass along important information or to be asked for advice by Legionnaires like Star Boy and Ferro when they had concerns about their powers. When a lab accident turned the Legionnaires on the Outpost into Bizarros, the reversal temporarily returned his powers of magnetism at full strength and he referred to himself as the \\"Legion receptionist and most powerful member,\\" but after Invisible Kid restored him and the other affected Legionnaires to normal he was left powerless once more. Dyrk also developed a crush on XS, and the two of them dated briefly before the onset of the Blight. Dyrk was instrumental in Brainiac 5's strategy to defeat Tharok when the Fatal Five attacked Outpost Allon, as Tharok had not taken him into consideration and did not bother tracking his movements. When the Blight attacked, however, he was among the Legionnaires taken by it and presumed dead until its defeat. Science Police Upon the disbanding of the Legion after the Blight and the loss of Outpost Allon, Dyrk chose to join the Science Police, following in the footsteps of his older brother Omar. He appeared once more in Legion Worlds #3 at the beginning of his assignment to his home planet, unwittingly becoming involved in an operation of the re-forming Legion when he chose to arrest Cosmic Boy for vigilantism, which had at the time been outlawed by the United Planets. Upon learning that Cosmic Boy had intentionally gotten himself arrested in order to steal a new faster-than-light ship to allow the Legion mobility, Dyrk agreed to cover for his former teammate, on the condition that he be brought in on everything when circumstances allowed. That apparently never came to pass, as Dyrk did not appear again in the post-Zero Hour run of the Legion of Super-Heroes comics, and has not appeared in any subsequent versions of the Legion.

It was also the name of the German company (Tipp-Ex GmbH & Co. KG) that produced the products in the Tipp-Ex line. While Tipp-Ex is a trademark name for correction products, in some countries it has become a genericised trademark: to tippex or to tippex out means to erase, either generally or with correction fluid. History Tipp-Ex correction paper Tipp- Ex correction paper was invented by Wolfgang Dabisch from Eltville, West Germany, who filed a patent in 1958 on Colored film for the correction of typing errors (German: Tippfehler). He subsequently founded a company of the same name. Shortly after that a Tipp-Ex Sales & Distribution company (Tipp-Ex Vertrieb GmbH & Co. KG) was founded in Frankfurt by Otto Carls. This company still exists under the name of Tipp-Ex GmbH & Co. KG close to Frankfurt. Tipp- Ex became a registered trademark with the German patent office in 1987. Earlier, in 1951, Bette Nesmith Graham invented the first correction fluid in her kitchen and began marketing the product in 1956 as Mistake Out, later called Liquid Paper. Tipp-Ex GmbH only started to produce white correction fluid in 1965 under the brand Tipp-Ex, but also as C-fluid. The name \\"Tipp-Ex\\" is based on \\"tippen\\", the German word for \\"to type\\", and \\"ex\\", Latin for \\"out of\\" or \\"from\\". As a result of the invention of Tipp-Ex, it became possible to erase a typographical error made on a typewriter. The typewriter would be backspaced to the letter that was to be changed, the correction paper would be placed behind the ribbon, and the mistyped letter would be re-typed. The system only worked if the typewriter repositioned the re-typed letter in exactly the same place as originally typed, which could be problematic if returning to a previous line. Demand for this correction paper grew very quickly and brought interest from German and international distributors. Yet another Tipp-Ex company was founded in 1979, in Buntingford, England, by Neil Taylor. In 1992 Tipp-Ex introduced its first correction tape, followed in 1995 by the successful Pocket Mouse which worked as a best seller. In 1998, the correction pen was launched. The range was extended to erasers, and in 2000, the new foam applicator was adapted to all the correction fluid bottles. In 1997, Soci√©t√© Bic acquired Tipp-Ex. Tipp-Ex is now the leading European correction products brand and is the tenth most recognized French brand name in the world. Usage Tipp-Ex can often be written on after it has dried. The Tipp-Ex correction fluid is a white liquid. It is used for painting over mistakes in a piece of writing. A brush (which was later replaced by a foam applicator) is attached to the cap, so when the bottle is closed, the brush is immersed in the Tipp-Ex. When unscrewed, the brush is covered in liquid Tipp- Ex which is then painted over the mistake. However, it is still possible to see that Tipp-Ex has been used, and also the original content if the paper is held up to a light. If the contents of a Tipp-Ex bottle have been exposed to too much air (for example, if the cap has been unscrewed too long or if the bottle is half-full and there is air filling the space), the Tipp-Ex becomes thicker, and sometimes even solidifies. To help prevent this, Tipp-Ex released a product called \\"Tipp-Ex thinner\\", a few drops of which are mixed with the contents of a bottle of partially dried Tipp-Ex to thin it. This extends the lifetime of a Tipp-Ex bottle. One must write with a ball point pen on top of Tipp-ex, as a liquid ink pen will smudge. Gel ink will require a few seconds to fully dry, but can be used if no ball point pen is available. Toxicology The organic solvent 1,1,1-trichloroethane was originally used as a thinner in the product. This solvent is readily absorbed by the lungs via inhalation. It passes readily through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and may be lethal following acute exposure. 1,1,1-trichloroethane is also an 'ozone depleter', being one of the substances responsible for causing damage to the Earth's ozone layer. For both reasons, it has not been added to Tipp-Ex since 2000, and it has been replaced by aliphatic hydrocarbons. In 1988 the Ayrshire Education Authority (AEA) banned the use of Tipp-Ex in all its schools, by staff and students alike. The reason given was the possibility of the solvent (1,1,1-trichloroethane) being inhaled by children as a form of substance abuse. While a number of schools in the UK are known to have introduced similar rules, the AEA is the only local education authority to have extended it to an entire region. The decision was revoked six months later following complaints from staff, pupils and parents.

She was born in Copenhagen, and grew up in a little apartment in the poor central part of the city. Her Jewish parents had immigrated to Denmark from Russia at the start of the 20th century. Her father was a tailor, and her mother was a seamstress. She started her career as a dancer in the Helsing√∏r Revue in 1936 and had her debut as a singer in 1938, when she was also broadcast on radio for the first time. She sang with various orchestras through the early 1940s and in 1940 formed her own swing trio. That same year her first record was released. She also toured during these years in Sweden. As a Jew, she fled Denmark in October 1943 along with her family, as the country had come under Nazi occupation. She spent the rest of the war years in Sweden where she continued having great success with her career, performing with orchestras and in cabarets and varieties. Her jazz singing style has been compared to that of Ella Fitzgerald. She returned to Denmark in 1945 and in the years that followed she became Denmark's leading female ballad singer. Among her successes were Vovsen i vinduet (\\"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\\") in 1953 and Heksedansen (\\"The Witch Dance\\") in 1960. Her best- selling song was Hele ugen alene (\\"Seven lonely days\\") in 1953, which sold over 120,000 copies. She was the first artist in Denmark to earn a gold record. She continued to garner awards throughout her career. In addition to her Danish language recordings, she recorded also in Swedish, Yiddish and Hebrew. After qualifying in the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest, she participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1958, where she sang Jeg rev et blad ud af min Dagbog (I Tore A Page Out Of My Diary). She ranked number 8. She participated once more in the Danish Melodi Grand Prix, singing a duet with Grethe S√∏nck entitled Hjemme hos os (\\"At our home\\"). In the late 1980s she retired from public life. She died in Skodsborg in the northern part of Sj√¶lland four days before her 83rd birthday. References *Laursen, Carsten Michael (1999).

She took her seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1923. Mae Nolan was born in San Francisco, California, and attended public schools, St. Vincent's Convent, and Ayres Business College of San Francisco. Nolan was elected as a Republican to the 67th Congress by special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, John Ignatius Nolan, on November 18, 1922. She served in the 67th and 68th Congresses, from January 23, 1923 to March 3, 1925. The Nolans' grave at Holy Cross CemeteryNolan was the fourth woman elected to Congress, after Jeannette Rankin, Alice Mary Robertson, and Winnifred Sprague Mason Huck. All four were elected as Republicans to the House of Representatives. Nolan was the first woman elected to her husband's seat in Congress, which is sometimes known as the \\"widow's succession\\". As of 2004, 36 widows have won their husbands' seats in the House, and 8 in the Senate. Recent examples are Representatives Mary Bono (widow of Sonny Bono) and Lois Capps and Doris Matsui, all of California, and Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri. The most successful example is Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, who served a total of 32 years in both houses and became the first woman elected to both the House and the Senate. The third woman elected to Congress, Winnifred Huck, was similarly elected to her father's seat. Nolan initially supported her late husband's stance on women's suffrage, but later supported the right of women to vote. During her term, she was the chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department. She was not a candidate for renomination in 1924 to the 69th Congress, claiming \\"politics is man's business\\". Nolan moved to Sacramento, California in her later years, where she died. She was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

His voyages led to the discovery of the Marquesas, Cook Islands and Solomons among other archipelagos. Born in Congosto, in El Bierzo Region (Le√≥n), he was the nephew of Lope Garc√≠a de Castro, viceroy of Peru. Search for Terra Australis Historian Brett Hilder has written of ‚Äúardent spirits in Peru, inspiring three Spanish voyages to the south west Pacific in the forty years from 1565 to 1605.‚ÄùHilder, B.(1980) The Voyage of Torres. p.2 Queensland University Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. One of these ardent spirits was certainly Spanish soldier Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa who arrived in Peru in 1557. Sarmiento de Gamboa developed an interest in Inca stories of gold and riches being collected from lands further to the west. Sarmiento's proposal for an expedition to find land in the Pacific was put to Governor Lope Garc√≠a de Castro, finding favour as it matched common Spanish belief in the existence of a great South Land. Historian Miriam Estensen argues that Governor Castro also agreed as a way of maintaining peace and order. ‚ÄúRestless and disruptive‚Äù elements in the Spanish Americas were encouraged to join such journeys of exploration to remove them from colonial society. The lure of possible wealth made these expeditions attractive to such men, often drawn from the poorest levels of society.Estensen, M. (2006) Terra Australis Incognita; The Spanish Quest for the Mysterious Great South Land. P.15. Allen & Unwin, Australia. However, Sarmiento de Gamboa was bitterly disappointed not to be made Captain- General of the expedition. Instead, command was given to the Governor Castro's nephew, the younger and relatively inexperienced √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira. Sarmiento was to be ‚ÄúCosmographer‚Äù.Estensen, M. (2006) p.17 In Sarmiento's written account, he was Captain of the flagship and at least on the same level as chief pilot and navigator Hernando Gallego. While Sarmiento's interest was the riches to be gained, Menda√±a's priority was conversion of \\"the heathen\\" to Christianity.Spate, O.H.K. (1979) The Spanish Lake. p.121, (Second Edition 2004) Australian National University. Deep divisions had been created within the Spanish command, even before the expedition departed. The first voyage of 1567-1569 The two ships, the 200-ton Los Reyes (the Capitana or flagship) and the 140-ton Todos Santos (the Almiranta or secondary ship) sailed from Callao, in Peru on 20 November 1567, with about 150 sailors, soldiers, priests and slaves on board. After sighting a small island in mid January (probably Nui in what is now Tuvalu), a significant body of land was sighted on February 7, 1568. It was Santa Isabel Island, where they landed several days later. The expedition had discovered the Solomon Islands which they named Islas Salomon. The Spanish immediately came into contact with Solomon Islanders who were later found to be cannibals, though at first the relationship was cordial. However, the Spanish expedition's need for fresh food and water quickly led to tension and conflict as the islanders were unable to provide supplies after some time.Spate, O.H.K (1979) p.124 The real prizes were pigs, desperately needed by the Spanish, which were also important to the local people's economy.Spate, O.H.K. (1979) p.124 The Spanish were horrified to find the islanders were cannibals when they were offered ‚Äúa quarter of a boy with the arm and hand‚Äù which the islanders urged Menda√±a to eat.Hernando Gallego quoted in Estensen, M. (2006) p.27 After building a small brigantine, the surrounding islands of Malaita, Guadalcanal, Makira (which was named San Cristobal) and Choiseul Island were explored. However, the attempts to barter for food led to the same cycle of friendly welcome, misunderstandings, sullen retreats, occasional reconciliations, robberies and violent retaliation.Spate, O.H.K. (1979) p129 Finally, at a council meeting of captains, pilots, soldiers and sailors on August 7, 1568, the decision was made to return to Peru. Menda√±a had wanted to sail further south, while Sarmiento de Gamboa and several soldiers unsuccessfully urged the establishment of a colony.Estensen, M. (2006) p.44 -5 The two ships sailed north then east, passing the Marshall islands and Wake island, before reaching the Mexican coast in late January 1569. It was a long and difficult voyage, with numerous deaths from scurvy. =Results of the first voyage= The main result of the expedition was the discovery for Europeans of the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. The navigators also gained valuable sailing experience for Spain, especially in crossing the vast South Pacific from Peru. These discoveries led to successive expeditions in search for Terra Australis, both by Menda√±a himself and by Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s. However, the Great South Land had not yet been discovered by Europeans. The islands found, by now popularly called the Solomon Islands, had not revealed more than a few indications of gold. There were no spices and the people had not been converted to Christianity.A family group of Islanders abducted by the Spanish did become devout Christians in Peru The 1595-1596 voyage A much larger and costlier expedition had been planned by the early 1590s, after Menda√±a had spent years courting favour in Madrid and Lima. Four ships and 378 men, women and children were to establish a colony in the Solomon Islands. Again, the leaders of this voyage had ‚Äúwidely divergent personalities.‚ÄùEstensen, M (2006) p.63 Menda√±a was again in command, accompanied by his wife Do√±a Isabel Barreto, her three brothers and a sister. Chief pilot was to be a young Portuguese navigator in Spanish service, Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s. An argumentative old soldier, Pedro Merino Manrique was chosen as camp master. Manrique caused disputes before the fleet had even departed. The four ships, San Ger√≥nimo (the Capitana), the Santa Ysabel (the Almiranta), the smaller frigate Santa Catalina and the galiot San Felipe left Callao on 9 April 1595. Spirits were high in the first month, fifteen marriages being celebrated.Spate, O.H.K. (1979) p.128 Menda√±a had Queir√≥s prepare charts for his Captains that only showed Peru and the Solomon Islands.incorrectly marked as 1500 leagues west of Lima, as the Spanish underestimated the size of the Pacific. See Spate, O.H.K (1979) On 21 July 1595 the ships reached the Marquesas Islands, (named for the wife of the then viceroy of Peru, Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca√±ete) to be met by four hundred people in canoes. Although the Spaniards admired their ‚Äúgraceful shape‚Äù and ‚Äúalmost white‚Äù complexion, the relationship with the natives later deteriorated. When the expedition left two weeks later, Queir√≥s estimated 200 Marquesans had been killed.Spate, O.H.K (1979) p.128 Despite Menda√±a's confidence that the Solomon Islands were nearby, it was not until 8 September that they sighted land again, this time the island of Nendo, which they named \\"Santa Cruz\\".This island lies about 400 kilometres south-east of the main Solomon Islands chain The Santa Ysabel had disappeared, however, and despite searches by the two smaller vessels, it could not be found.As archaeological work in the early 1970s showed, the Santa Ysabel apparently made it to San Cristobal in the Solomon Islands chain, probably waiting there for the other ships. What fate befell the people of the Santa Ysabel we do not know. See Allen, J. and R.C. Green, 'Mendana 1595 and the Fate of the Lost, 'Almiranta': an archaeological investigation', The Journal of Pacific History,(1972), pp 73-91 Arriving at what is now Graciosa Bay, a settlement was commenced. Relations with local islanders and their chief Malope started well, with food provided and assistance in constructing buildings. However, morale amongst the Spanish was low and sickness (almost certainly malaria) was rife. Manrique was murdered at the orders of, and in front of Menda√±a, and shortly afterwards, Malope was killed by soldiers. Relations with the Islanders soon worsened. Wracked by internal divisions and an increasing death toll, the settlement began to fall apart. Menda√±a himself died on 18 October 1595, leaving his wife as heir and governor, her brother Lorenzo as captain-general. On 30 October, the decision was made to abandon the settlement. When the three ships departed on 18 November 1595, forty-seven people had died in the space of one month.Estensen, M (2006) p.85 Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s is credited with bringing the San Ger√≥nimo safely into the Philippines without the aid of charts, arriving in Manila Bay on 11 February 1596. Over fifty people died on the twelve-week voyage from Santa Cruz, in part due to the lack of food supplies and allegedly Do√±a Isabel‚Äôs refusal to share out her private store of food and water.On arrival in Manila Bay a horrified official asked why Do√±a Isabel‚Äôs two pigs had not been slaughtered. ‚ÄúWhat the Devil! Is this a time for courtesy with pigs?‚Äù he asked. See Spate, O.H.K (1979) p.131 The frigate (carrying Menda√±a's body) disappeared during the voyage, while the galiot San Felipe arrived in the southern end of Mindanao several days later. Bust at Solomon Island museum at Point Cruz Aftermath Of the 378 who sailed from Peru, about 100 survived, but ten more died shortly after arriving in Manila. Do√±a Isabel Barreto was honoured in Manila and Queir√≥s was commended for his service and absolved of any responsibility for the killings on Santa Cruz. Three months later Do√±a Isabel married the governor's cousin. She continued to agitate for a return to the Solomon Islands. She died in 1612.Estensen, M. (2006) p.88-90 Back in Peru in June 1597, Queir√≥s began his campaign to return to the Solomon Islands, leading the next Spanish venture in 1605. This expedition was also unsuccessful, but it led to the discovery of the Pitcairn Islands and Vanuatu which were explored, and briefly settled in the case of Espiritu Santo. Queir√≥s visited the Solomons in 1606, but was unable to establish a settlement. The Solomons were not again visited by outsiders until 1767, when Philip Carteret sighted Santa Cruz and Malaita islands. The story of the voyage is told in The Islands of Unwisdom, a historical novel by Robert Graves.

He was the author of 13 published novels, nearly 150 short stories, numerous poems, and a handful of books and articles on various subjects. Though he wrote science fiction, fantasy, horror stories, detective fiction, and poetry, Petaja considered his work part of an older tradition of \\"weird fiction.\\" Petaja was also a small press publisher. In 1995, he was named the first ever Author Emeritus by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Of Finnish descent, Petaja's best known works are a series of science fiction novels based on the Kalevala, the Finnish verse epic. Petaja's series brought him readers from around the world,Steinberg, David. \\"Sci-fi writer's fame reached to Siberia.\\" San Francisco Examiner, December 20, 1997. while his particular mythological approach to science fiction has been discussed in scholarly publicationsKailo, Kaarina. \\"Spanning the Iron and Space Ages: Emil Petaja's Kalevala-based fantasy tales\\".

In a statement published in Contemporary Authors (Gale Research, 1984), Petaja commented, \\"My writing endeavors have mainly been to entertain, except for the factual material concerning Hannes Bok and fantasy art in general, which serves to indicate my enthusiasm for these subjects. My novels about the Finnish legendary epic Kalevala: The Land of Heroes spring from a lifelong interest in this fine poetic work. I own six translations of the Kalevala, as well as the work in the original. Both of my parents were Finnish.\\"Contemporary Authors (Gale Research, 1984).  Early life and work  Emil Petaja (pronounced PET-a-ya) was born on April 12, 1915 in Milltown, Montana ‚Äì a small lumber town in the western part of the state. He was the youngest of 10 children born to John and Hanna Petaja. The future author attended schools in Bonner and Missoula, Montana.\\"Emil Petaja.\\" Missoulian, Missoula, Montana. August 20, 2000. According to an autobiographical account, Petaja's introduction to fantastic literature came in 1931 when he came across a copy of Weird Tales. Reading the magazine changed his life, and he became a lifelong devotee of fantasy and science fiction. Petaja started out as a fan and immersed himself in the genres by befriending other interested individuals, by collecting pulp and science fiction magazines, and by forming clubs and associations. During this time, Petaja also struck-up correspondence with, and sometimes befriended, such early luminaries as H. P. Lovecraft,Selected Letters V (1934-1937) Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, and August Derleth. Notably, Petaja is part of a unique group of individuals in the history of the genres who turned their fandom into literature. He was also a member of First Fandom ‚Äì a group which honors fans from the time when science fiction was known as \\"scientification.\\" Petaja corresponded with Lovecraft in late 1934, and the next year proposed teaming with Duane W. Rimel to form a fan magazine, The Fantaisiste's Mirror, that would resume serializing Lovecraft's Supernatural Horror in Literature from the point it had left off in the defunct Fantasy Fan. However, the magazine never materialized. Petaja and Lovecraft continued corresponding until the latter's death in 1937. The author's first published writings date from 1935 with the short story, \\"Two Doors,\\" for the semi-prozine Unusual Stories. Another early work, \\"Weird Music\\" (written with Duane W. Rimel), appeared in 1936 in The Phantagraph. Other short fiction and verse was published in The Californian (alongside the efforts of Lovecraft), Futuria Fantasia, The Acolyte, and other small press and regional publications. Much of Petaja's early literary efforts were verse ‚Äì and according to the author, he won a \\"couple of minor regional poetry contests.\\" In 1936, Petaja self- published a chapbook of poems, Brief Candle, running-off copies on the mimeograph machine at Montana State University, where he was a student majoring in creative writing.anonymous. \\"Quill Club Started at the University.\\" Helena Independent, November 27, 1936. Brief Candle contained cover art and illustrations by Petaja's friend, Hannes Bok, whom he had met that same year. The chapbook marked the first book publication for each author. According to Petaja, approximately 40 to 50 copies were printed with many \\"given to friends and well wishers.\\" Some of these early pieces were later collected in As Dream and Shadow (SISU, 1972). Other poems from throughout his career remain unpublished. In 1937, Petaja moved to Los Angeles, California. There, he settled into the Los Angeles sci-fi scene, befriending Ray Bradbury ‚Äì then still a teenager ‚Äì as well as Henry Kuttner, Henry Hasse, Forrest J. Ackerman and others. Throughout 1937 and 1938, Petaja and Bok shared an apartment, and together they attended fan meetings, haunted second-hand book shops, went to the movies, and helped each other with their poems and stories. In an autobiographical account, Petaja stated: \\"Perhaps when all is washed down over the dam, my major claim to fame will rest in the fact that it was I who got Hannes down to Los Angeles and I who dragged him, reluctantly, to the meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society. Where we met Ray Bradbury.\\" \\"It was at Clifton's Cafeteria on Broadway. We couldn't afford to eat there, usually, but we took advantage of the free lime sherbet. In that fabled back room where so many of the s-f elite have sat around the long table chewing the fat, fanwize, Hannes first met Forrie Ackerman, Henry Kuttner, et al.\\" During the 1940s, Petaja continued to write, turning out dozens of stories for many of the pulp fiction magazines. A prolific author, his science fiction, fantasy, and weird fiction stories appeared in Fantastic Adventures, Worlds of Tomorrow, Weird Tales, Fantasy and Science Fiction, Future Science Fiction Stories, and elsewhere. One story, \\"Dinosaur Goes Hollywood,\\" published in Amazing Stories in 1944, features a dinosaur on the loose of a movie set. Some of these early works were brought together in the author's only short story collection, Stardrift and Other Fantastic Flotsam (Fantasy Press, 1971). Petaja also published under the name of Theodore Pine (Theodore was the author's middle name, and Pet√§j√§ is Finnish for \\"pine\\"). As Pine, Petaja sold stories to detective and western story magazines of the period such as Crack Detective, Ten Detective Aces, Ten Story Detective, Mammoth Western, Western Action, and Western Trails. Many of these stories have evocative titles like \\"The Corpse Wants Company,\\" \\"Good Night, Dream Bandit,\\" \\"The Perfumed Peril,\\" \\"Satan Hogs the Camera,\\" \\"Bullets on the Downbeat,\\" \\"Sixgun Serenade,\\" and \\"Trigger Surgery.\\" During the 1940s, Petaja unsuccessfully attempted to publish a detective novel. One of his last detective stories, \\"Stirred Ashes,\\" appeared in the Saint magazine in 1967. Petaja had also been a member of the Mystery Writers of America.  Later life and work  In the late 1940s, Petaja moved to San Francisco, where he turned his interest in photography into a profession. He traveled the state as a school photographer, and at times maintained studios in Sausalito and San Francisco, California. He was the house photographer for local theater groups, and wrote articles for magazines such as Popular Photography. Having largely given up writing by the early 1950s, Petaja resumed literary work in the early 1960s. His first published novels were Alpha Yes, Terra No! (Ace Books, 1965) and The Caves of Mars (Ace Books, 1965). These works, like a number of Petaja's subsequent novels, were published as part of the paperback series of Ace doubles. As such, Petaja was published alongside emerging writers like Samuel R. Delany, Michael Moorcock, Brian Stableford, and Dean Koontz. Petaja, being of Finnish descent, is best known for works making up a series based on the Kalevala, the Finnish verse epic. In each of the books which comprise the \\"Otava Series\\" ‚Äì Saga of Lost Earths (Ace Books, 1966), Star Mill (Ace Books, 1966), The Stolen Sun (Ace Books, 1967), and Tramontane (Ace Books, 1967) ‚Äì an Earth descendant of one of the four main heroes of the Kalevala is reborn into an avatar's role in order to re-enact adventures on Otava, the planet of origin of the Kalevala pantheon. The series brought Petaja readers from around the world; while his mythological approach to science fiction ‚Äì an early example within the genre ‚Äì was discussed in scholarly papers presented at academic conferences. In 1979, two omnibus editions of the \\"Otava Series\\" were published by DAW Books. A fifth novel in the cycle, Return to Otava (1970), remains unpublished. Another novel unconnected with the series but related to the Kalevala is The Time Twister (Dell, 1968). The Green Planet books ‚Äì Lord of the Green Planet (Ace Books, 1967) and Doom of the Green Planet (Ace Books, 1968) ‚Äì recount similar adventures befalling its Irish protagonist, who finds himself role-playing Celtic deities for the benefit of a madman armed with instruments of coercion. Other novels dating from the late 1960s and early 1970s include The Prism (Ace Books, 1968), The Nets of Space (Berkley, 1969), The Path Beyond the Stars (Dell, 1969), and Seed of the Dreamers (Ace Books, 1970). Four other novels remain unpublished, Glory Stone (1970), Little Gods (1972), Spin the Star Wheel (1975), and Zodiac World (1980). This latter work concerns a planet whose population is ruled by astrological beliefs. As chairman of the Golden Gate Futurians ‚Äì an informal club for writers and fans ‚Äì Petaja hosted meetings for friends and colleagues at his home in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco. Among the regular attendees were local noted authors like Fritz Leiber, Avram Davidson and E. Hoffmann Price. Writers and editors who might be visiting from out of town ‚Äì such as Donald Wollheim or Harlan Ellison ‚Äì would also attend and there have a chance to meet local figures like the Satanist Anton LeVay or the film maker Kenneth Anger. Petaja enjoyed the company of other writers and artists and was acquainted with a number of individuals who lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, such as Warren Hinkle (his upstairs neighbor), Anthony Boucher, Frank M. Robinson, Poul Anderson, Philip K. Dick and Robert A. Heinlein. To date, Petaja's fiction has been translated and published in England, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, France, and Finland. In 1995, in recognition of a lifetime of significant achievement, Petaja was named an \\"Author Emeritus\\" by the Science Fiction Writers of America.Roberson, Fontaine. \\"Classic Science Fiction From Diamond Street.\\" Castro Star, October, 1997. The award was created \\"as a way to recognize and appreciate senior writers in the genres of science fiction and fantasy who have made significant contributions to our field but who are no longer active or whose excellent work may no longer be as widely known as it once was.\\" As Author Emeritus, Petaja was invited to speak at the annual Nebula Awards banquet. Petaja died of heart failure on August 17, 2000. He had suffered complications brought on from the treatment of a blood clot. After his death obituaries appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world.Yu, Allan. \\"Emil Theodore Petaja, 85, science fiction writer, artist.\\" San Jose Mercury News. August 18, 2000.  Emil Petaja and Hannes Bok  As a lifelong friend and collector of Hannes Bok, Petaja founded the Bokanalia Foundation in 1967, three years after the artist's death. According to a published statement, the foundation was set up \\"with the help and encouragement of Harold Taves of Seattle and Ray Bradbury of Los Angeles and the Golden Gate Futurians of San Francisco . . . . The avowed intention of Bokanalia is simply to keep the great imaginative art of Hannes Bok from slipping into oblivion, and to make new (better than pulp) prints available to his many admirers all over the world\\". Between 1967 and 1970, Petaja published three portfolios of Bok's art. Those portfolios include Variations on Bok Theme, (black & white portfolio, 1967); The Famous Power Series, (black & white portfolio, with text by Bok, 1969); and A Memorial Portfolio, (color portfolio, with booklet with text by Petaja, 1970). Petaja also authored a commemorative volume, And Flights of Angels: The Life and Legend of Hannes Bok (Bokanalia Memorial Foundation, 1968). Along with brief contributions from Wollheim, Roger Zelazny, Jack Gaughan, and others, And Flights of Angels contains Petaja's long biographical essay on the artist, a checklist of Bok's published artwork and writings, and reproductions of a substantial number of drawings, prints and illustrations. Later, under the SISU imprint (and on behalf of the Bokanalia Foundation), Petaja published an illustrated volume of Bok's poetry, Spinner of Silver and Thistle (1972), as well as editing The Hannes Bok Memorial Showcase of Fantasy Art (1974).  Emil Petaja and film  Petaja was a lifelong film buff and collector of movie memorabilia. He had a large library of film-related books, owned hundreds of 16mm films and videotapes, and enjoyed recounting stories about films and actors.Gladysz, Thomas. \\"Emil Petaja.\\" Classic Images, Muscatone, Iowa. October, 2000. Today, he is best known to film enthusiasts as the author of Photoplay Edition (SISU, 1975). This illustrated guide was the first book on the subject of photoplay editions, the movie tie-in books of the silent and early sound era. Petaja based the book on his personal collection, which at the time of publication numbered more than eight hundred books. As the author of Photoplay Edition, Petaja was a special guest at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival in 1998 and 1999. While living in Los Angeles, Petaja worked in the labs at Technicolor, and wrote a handful of stories set in and around the movie capital. His interest in movies and film making continued through the years. Petaja made two short dramatic films, Dread Return in 1949,anonymous. \\"Sausalito Gallery to Show Experimental Movie\\", San Rafael Independent Journal, September 22, 1949. and The Call in 1950.

Background The Beggars trilogy is set in a near future in which genetic engineering has become commonplace. \\"Genemods\\" were developed for intelligence, physical features, personality, enhanced sensory perception, and so on, but when Dr. Susan Melling discovered a genemod to alleviate the need for sleep, she changed the face of the world. These so-called \\"Sleepless\\" were not only more productive, due to 33% more hours in the day, but less prone to the vagaries of the unconscious mind due to their inability to sleep; they were well-adjusted, cheerful, intelligent, driven, and quickly came to dominate the scientific, economic, intellectual, medical, legal and technological arenas of the world, often at unprecedentedly young ages. As with many successful minorities, they were the target of prejudice, racism and general intolerance, but the final blow came when Melling discovered an unexpected side effect. The sleeplessness genemod had unlocked an unprecedented cellular-regeneration mechanism, and Sleepless do not age. At the start of the novel, their oldest specimen, computer magnate Kevin Baker, looks 35 years old but actually is 116. Beggars Ride begins in 2120 in a United States becalmed. The Sleepless have long ago banded together for protection and defense, forming the community \\"Sanctuary,\\" first in the southwest corner of New York State and then later in their own orbital. In 2092 the Sleepless, led by permanent leader Jennifer Sharifi, attempted to secede from America, but were prevented by a small contingent of their youngest generation. These \\"SuperBright\\" Sleepless, led by Jennifer's granddaughter Miranda, underwent such advanced engineering that their thoughts are no longer the same as normal humans. Jennifer was indicted for treason and served 27 years in prison; in the prologue of the novel, she is released. The Supers, meanwhile, moved to Earth and transformed the social landscape of America. America's political situation at the time had been unstable: 80% of the population, \\"Livers,\\" were unemployed and supported by a lavish dole, made possible by cheap cold fusion discovered by Kenzo Yagai sometime before 2008. These \\"Livers\\" were supposedly the upper class, enjoying a life of \\"aristo leisure\\" and served by the \\"donkeys,\\" genemod white-collar workers who were voted into power by Livers due to promises of increased prosperity. Due to economic stagnancy and (what turned out to be) constant sabotage by soi-disant revolutionary forces, the infrastructure supporting the Livers, and thus the nation itself, was in grave danger of collapse. Miranda Sharifi changed this by creating the \\"Change syringe,\\" a slim black injection that rebuilt the human body to be photosynthetic, able to absorb nutrients from any adjacent biological matter (dirt, grass, clothes, etc.), and resistant against disease, infection, foreign matter and casual injury. Lying on the ground in the sun for half an hour is sufficient \\"food\\" for any Changed individual. The Livers, now autotrophic, were able to cast free of the donkeys and now live in wandering communes, while the donkeys retreated behind their Y-shielded enclaves and likewise turned to a life of leisure.  Plot summary =Book I (November 2120-January 2121) In the prologue, Jennifer Sharifi evicts her granddaughter from the Sanctuary Orbital; the Supers are later revealed (through use of inter-chapter epistolary e-mails) to have moved to Selene Base on the Moon. These e-mails, sent by poor Livers, donkey enclaves and even top researchers, always regard the Change syringes, which the Supers have stopped supplying; neither syringes nor replies are ever sent. The novel then cuts to Jackson Aranow, M.D., resident of the Manhattan East Enclave. As a doctor in the age of the Change syringe, he is reduced to Changing newborns, dealing with occasional trauma, and death certificates, which he issues now for Harold Winthrop Wayland. He then returns home, where the reader is first introduced to his sister Theresa and ex-wife Cazie Saunders. The two could not be more different. \\"Tessie\\" is a pale, fragile girl, unChanged, who suffers from a neurological condition that causes her to feel endangered in the presence of new and unaccustomed stimuli, but refuses to take neuropharmaceuticals; she is writing a book on Leisha Camden, a long-dead Sleepless. Cazie is an explosive, endlessly vital, take-charge woman who comes and goes as she pleases. Her companions underline the vacility of donkey life, while Cazie underlines that, of 90 million eligible voters in the recent presidential election, only 8% bothered. America is ceasing to exist as a political unit. She also reveals that there has been a break-in at a Y-cone plant in Jackson's family business, TenTech (which she owns a third of, due to the divorce), and insists that they investigate on the morrow. The break-in is actually being orchestrated by a prodigious young data-dipper, Lizzie Francy, now seventeen and very much pregnant, and accompanied by her friend Victoria Turner (Diana, it is revealed later, has legally changed her name). As far as Lizzie is concerned, she owns the world: she's one of the best dippers alive, she has been helping provide for her tribe since Vicki gave her her first computer terminal, she got herself pregnant by some boy because she wanted a baby, and she is about to do the impossible: break into a Y-shielded donkey factory, steal some of their wares, and escape to tell the tale. Though the factory itself has gone haywire (the robots within were improperly programmed and have been destroying products instead of creating them), everything goes according to plan... Except for the escaping part. Restless and locked in, she and Vicki prowl the premises, attempting to find a way out. Jackson and Cazie arrive to confront their worst nightmare: not the insane factory, but rather the fact that a Liver--an unwashed, stupid, uneducated member of the lower classes--was smart to dip their factory. On the strength of Vicki's character (and possibly other things; she reminds him alarmingly of Cazie), Jackson refuses to arrest them, and furthermore accompanies Lizzie and Vicki back to the tribe when Lizzie goes into month-early premature labor (the baby is a breech presentation). He gains points with the tribe by injecting the baby with a Change syringe, which the tribe only had one of. (Jackson has three more with him, plus a stockpile in his home.) After dealing with a break-in from Livers in search of Change syringes for their children, Theresa, in endless search for meaning to her life, visits a bizarre Liver enclave where trios of people inject themselves with a red syringe that forces them to stay in close physical proximity to each other--on pain of death. (The triads also take on a new composite name; one pre-bonded group, Josh Mike and Patty, are later introduced as \\"Jomp.\\") The Livers have a holo recording from Miranda Sharifi explaining that this syringe is her next gift to them, building on the Change; this is Theresa's excuse to escape when she decides she doesn't want to be involved. Her next visit is to a convent, which she is ready to enter until the Mother Superior informs her that they use neuropharms to induce religious euphoria in their sisters. Afterwards she dumps Jackson's last sixteen syringes out of her aircar and watches as the people below fight over them. Jennifer Sharifi visits legendary Russian scientist Serge Mikhailovich Strukov, whom she instructs to create a genemod virus that will hardwire agoraphobia, xenophobia and novelty anxiety into the brains of anyone it hits. Researchers have been looking for years for neuropharms that can evade the Cell Cleaner, which destroys any foreign substance in the body, including beneficial analgesics and recreational drugs. What Strukov has found is a virus that changes brain conditions, so that, while the delivering virus is foreign, the conditions it leaves behind are treated as native by the Cell Cleaner. He also reveals that Sanctuary, not Miranda Sharifi, distributed the red bonding syringes and accompanying holo as a means to control Sleepers. Jackson is contacted by Lizzie with a daring plan. Harold Wayland, Jackson's patient from the first chapter, was an elected official, specifically District Supervisor. Lizzie wants to convince one of the members of her tribe, Shockey Toor, to run for that office. There are a lot more Livers in Willoughby County, Pennsylvania than donkeys, and if all the Livers register, between 11:30 and 11:50 PM on December 31 as an ambush on the donkeys, they can landslide their candidate into office. This is why Lizzie needs Jackson: comlink transmissions can be dipped, so his aircar will help spread the propaganda instead. (Lizzie's son, Dirk, is doing just fine--and, if Lizzie's plan works, will be doing a lot better.) At 00:01 hours on January 1, 2121, 4,082 donkeys and 4,450 Livers have registered to vote. Book II (March‚ÄìApril 2121) Six days before the election, Jackson drops by Lizzie's tribe to see the American political system at work: Livers accepting bribes, donkey newsgrid reporters all over the place, the candidate enjoying the perks of fame on his back under a slumming donkey girl. He realizes that, though the Livers are paying lip-service to the donkey figurehead candidate, Donald Thomas Serrano, they fully intend to vote for Shockey. He is also approached by a young Liver holding a dying baby, who is too far along for Jackson to help--especially since he, a donkey doctor, is out of Change syringes. Vicki tells him that, with Change syringes now in short supply, the world will need more doctors soon. \\"I'm the biggest advocate of adjusting to [what Miranda Sharifi gave the world]. So far, we haven't done that.\\" She also reveals that Jackson's attraction to her is reciprocated. On April 1, election day, Jackson takes Vicki and Lizzie (sans Dirk) to a nearby camp for some last-minute propaganda; they then vote from Jackson's aircar, and then watch the newsgrids of the Livers lining up to vote. The Livers, who up until this point have been courting fame, are all nervous around the donkey reporters; and the tally of votes shows Serrano's name skyrocketing. Back at the camp, everyone is timid, including Annie Francy and Dirk; they are all, Jackson realizes, acting like Theresa. Somehow, someone has found a way to create a neuropharm that causes fast-acting, non-reversible changes in brain chemistry, in this case inducing fear of novelty. Who could come up with such an innovation, besides Miranda Sharifi?--and how could Serrano have gotten his hands on it?--or, alternatively, why would Miranda have wasted it on a tiny election like this? (In fact, it was Sanctuary, testing Strukov's virus to see if it actually works.) Jackson takes Vicki, Lizzie and Dirk to his home in Manhattan East, where Theresa is just as terrified of Dirk as Dirk is of her. Jackson calls Thurmond Rogers, a lead researcher at neuropharm corporation Kelvin-Castner, to get an investigation going into the exact effects of the drug. Lizzie takes the opportunity to dip Jackson's house OS, and gets a glimpse of what Theresa watches on the newsgrids: endless photos of unChanged infants. She leaves Theresa a personal message, begging her on behalf of the Livers to get Miranda Sharifi to send more Change syringes. Theresa returns to the triad camp (which has evidently also been infected by Strukov's agoraphobia weapon) to see the Miranda-Sharifi holo; to do so, she must overcome her own inhibitions, which she does by becoming Cazie Saunders. It works remarkably well, though she feels confused about it; she has always denied the use of neuropharms so that she would not lose what it meant to be herself. She takes the holo with her, which she is sure is counterfeit, on a visit to the La Solana compound in New Mexico, where Leisha Camden once lived. There she leaves a message for Miranda Sharifi, as have thousands of supplicants before her, pouring out her heart and soul, her views on self, her views on pain and its necessity as proof of life, her views on the red syringes-- And, at the news of these syringes, Miranda Sharifi opens a comlink. The speed of their conversation proves that they are not at Selene, but rather right here at La Solana. She agrees to take action about the red syringes, and also explains why they discontinued the Change syringes: As Theresa departs in her chartered plane, La Solana is destroyed by a thermonuclear weapon. The SuperSleepless are dead... And only Theresa Aranow knows it. Jackson takes Vicky, Dirk and Shockey to Kelvin-Castner to undergo various tests. K-C makes no reply whatsoever as to how to reverse the condition, spending all its time trying to reverse-engineer it to its own profit. As far as they are concerned, they can always count on Miranda Sharifi to fix their problems for them. TenTech is asked for an investment, and Jackson wearily agrees--it'll help him keep control of the project. Meanwhile, Lizzie (for lack of anything else to do) tries to figure out who attacked her tribe. It takes nearly a month of careful dipping before she breaks into the transmission data... And discovers it points straight at Sanctuary. She needs to tell Dr. Aranow, and with no other recourse, decides to walk to his enclave. Theresa, for her part, is sick with radiation poisoning for months, but her first priority is to struggle out with the news that the SuperSleepless are gone. Jackson won't believe it, though Vicki does: \\"It's the only motive that makes sense for bombing La Solana without taking credit or making demands.\\" Jackson realizes that, without Miranda Sharifi, the world is poised to fall apart, starting with the agoraphobia weapon, unless he does something about it. He moves into Kelvin-Caster's proprietary labs to ensure a counteragent is created, teaching himself to become a medical researcher in the process. Book III (May 2121) Jennifer Sharifi, safe on Sanctuary Orbital, oversees the next part of her plans. Strukov's virus has been tested, a newly designed delivery drone has been successfully used to penetrate the Y-shields of low-security enclaves, and La Solana has been destroyed to keep the meddling Supers from hampering her again, though at great cost to Jennifer: she hallucinates Miranda's face and form during odd moments. Now it is time for a real test: to infect Brookhaven National Laboratories, one of the most well-protected enclaves in existence. The attack succeeds, and Jennifer's people pour champagne... Only to receive a message from Strukov, who in a fit of species solidarity has decided to cancel all the remaining attacks... And then some. \\"Do you know La Rouchefoucauld on superiority? 'Le vrai moyen d'√™tre tromp√© c'est de se croire plus fin que les autres.'\\" (\\"The truest way to be deceived is to think oneself more knowing than others.\\") Sanctuary Orbital and all remaining living Sleepless are destroyed by a nuclear weapon. Lizzie has made it into Manhattan East Enclave, but is immediately apprehended by security. Taking advantage of a lull in activities (as everyone scurries to watch the reports of Sanctuary's destruction), she sends another transmission to Theresa, begging her to get her out. Theresa does, once again by \\"becoming\\" Cazie. Lizzie then meets with Jackson at K-C, who instructs her (privately) to data-dip their systems, looking for proof that K-C hasn't spent any time working on the counter-agent. Meanwhile, Vicki moves through the Decon, but doesn't arrive until nearly midnight, having been detained by events pertaining to Theresa. Theresa is safely back at home, but curious as to herself. She has her nursing 'bot take two separate brain scans, one of Theresa under normal circumstances and one while she is \\"being\\" Cazie. Then, as Cazie, she takes the nursing 'bot to a Liver enclave by pretending to be a beggar. Unfortunately, in her unChanged and weak state, this leaves her prone to infection, and she becomes extremely sick. Vicki is the instrument of her salvation, administering the one Change syringe Jackson kept hidden in the hopes that Theresa would one day accept it. Tess, realizing that no Change can change who she is, accepts the syringe and is healed. Vicki later shows Jackson reproductions of the two brain scans (drawn on her breasts, the only way she could sneak them through decon); the \\"Cazie\\" scan shows \\"intense non- somatic activity,\\" the sort associated with \\"epileptic seizures, religious visions, imaginative delusions,\\" but controlled and channeled through intense concentration. Lizzie moves through decon herself, once again needing to carry vital information in her head: namely, the proof that K-C has no intention of working on a counter-agent, and that furthermore, their regimen of placating research is tailored specifically to fool Jackson. She has also discovered that the agoraphobia weapon has a 38.7% chance of mutating to the point where it can be transmitted directly through person-to-person contact; even if no more attacks are launched, the weapon can still spread. However, K-C doesn't fall in line until Vicki and Jackson announce, publicly, that there is no more deus ex machina; \\"The machina broke down,\\" Vicki says, \\"and the dea is dead.\\" If the humans don't help themselves, no one will. Someone does. In the epilogue, taking place in November 2128, the reader finds Theresa, now the leader of a semi-religious begging order, teaching the biofeedback techniques she developed to the \\"inhibited,\\" as they are now called, helping them conquer the fear artificially wired into their brains. Jackson is the second part of the Trojan Horse, providing the technical, holographic and medical equipment the Livers will need to train themselves fully into Theresa's techniques. No one has yet found a reverser, but his lover Vicki calls him with new information: at the Chicago School of Medicine, where the original Sleepless were engineered 125 years ago, the frozen gametes of the SuperSleepless have just arrived, delivered by time-activated 'bot. The debate on what to do with them, Vicki assures us, will be fierce...

Born in Newbury, Berkshire, England, Lewis became a Methodist local preacher at the age of seventeen. In 1900 he traveled to Newfoundland, Canada as a missionary before continuing his education in the United States. He eventually became a professor of theology at Drew. Lewis' early work demonstrates the influence of Boston personalism, a school of Protestant liberal theology widespread among Methodists during the first half of the 20th century, and British idealism. His book Jesus Christ and the Human Quest is an example of his early perspective. In the book, Lewis argues that the Christian faith has its foundation in the nature of persons and personhood. In 1929 he was named one of three editors of the Abingdon Bible Commentary. While preparing the massive reference work, Lewis claimed to have \\"rediscovered the Bible\\" for himself. He reacted strongly to the 1931 report Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry after One Hundred Years, which he believed hampered the Christian missionary effort, in his article \\"The Re- thought Theology of the Re-thinking of Missions\\" which appeared in the Christian Century. Growing more suspicious of the subjective theological liberalism of the day, he published A Christian Manifesto in 1934. In the book, Lewis railed against liberal theology (which he referred to as modernism), reasserting classical Christian themes such as the transcendence of God, the sinfulness of humankind, the divinity of Christ, and the objective work of the atonement. Lewis wrote: \\"No statement of Christian belief which does not include a supernatural reference...is a true statement.\\"Edwin Lewis, A Christian Manifesto (Nashville: Abingdon-Cokesbury, 1934), p. 15 He followed A Christian Manifesto with A Philosophy of Christian Revelation and The Creator and the Adversary, both of which continued his reclamation of Christian orthodoxy from an Arminian perspective. Lewis argued that God triumphs over evil by outsuffering and outloving his adversary.Thomas A.

The style of pipe spread quickly to Africa, and is known in the Americas since the 1960s. A chillum pipe is used in Rastafari rituals. Chillum stone When smoking a chillum a chillum stone is often inserted in the pipe to keep from directly inhaling debris much like a screen or filter is used in other pipes. They are generally tight fitting, conical with a flat top and usually have a small hole drilled down through the centre and slits down the sides to allow smoke to pass freely. Before they were commercially available people would search for the right size of pebble or stone to fit their pipes, a practice still followed by some. According to Alfred Dunhill, Africans have long employed chillum-style pipes for smoking cannabis and later tobacco. Gourds and various horns were often employed while conical bowls were common in Uganda. One of the more famous pipes is an ivory cone pipe once belonging to \\"Waganda\\" monarch King Mtesa. More recently, it has also seen use in sacraments by Rastafari.Spotlight on Rastafarian sects 'Rasta in Transition' launched at Livity Restaurant Since the 1960s the embellished bamboo chillum has become an American folk art form. These pipes are handmade and often sold by the artists on street corners in places like the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco and the Greenwich Village area of New York City. The designs on these contemporary smoking pipes recall traditional decorated bamboo pipes from Borneo, however, the American carved bamboo design often employs a brass lighting fixture for a bowl.

Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, Ant-Man's first appearance was in Tales to Astonish #35 (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist Hank Pym's superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size, but reformed thieves Scott Lang and Eric O'Grady also took on the mantle after the original changed his superhero identity to various other aliases, such as Giant-Man, Goliath, and Yellowjacket. Pym's Ant-Man is also a founding member of the super hero team known as the Avengers. The character has appeared in several films based on the Marvel character, such as Ant-Man (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Fictional character biography Over the years a number of different characters have assumed the title of Ant-Man, most of whom have been connected with the Avengers. Hank Pym The original Ant-Man was Biophysicist and Security Operations Center expert Dr. Henry 'Hank' Pym; who decided to become a superhero after the death of his first wife Maria Trovaya, who had been a political dissident in Hungary. Falling in love with him and believing that his American citizenship would protect her, Hank and Maria traveled to Hungary shortly after their marriage to start their new life together. Unfortunately they were confronted by corrupt agents of the secret police. Hank was knocked unconscious and Maria was murdered. Pym was greatly distraught by his wife's death, and decided to do whatever he could in the future to battle injustice. After discovering a chemical substance, which he called Pym Particles, that would allow the user to alter his size, he armed himself with a helmet that could control ants. After that, Pym would shrink down to the size of an insect to become the mystery-solving Ant-Man, solving crimes and stopping criminals. He soon shared his discovery with his new girlfriend Janet van Dyne, who became his crime-fighting partner The Wasp, when he helped her avenge the death of her scientist father Vernon van Dyne who was killed by an alien unleashed by one of Vernon's own experiments. The duo would become founding members of the Avengers, fighting recurring enemies such as the mad scientist Egghead, the mutant Whirlwind, and Pym's own robotic creation Ultron. While Pym is the original Ant-Man, he has adopted other aliases over the years including Giant-Man, Goliath, Yellowjacket, and Wasp after Janet's presumed death in Secret Invasion. Leaving his original persona vacant, his successors have taken up the Ant-Man role while Pym explored these other identities. Scott Lang Scott Lang was a thief who became Ant-Man after stealing the Ant-Man suit to save his daughter Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Lang from a heart condition.

Built in 1765, it was the home of Reuben Colburn, a patriot and shipbuilder, from 1765 to 1818. The house, one of the first to be built in the area, is most notable as one of the staging area's for Benedict Arnold's 1775 Quebec expedition. It is operated by the state as the Colburn House State Historic Site, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description The Colburn House stands on a rise overlooking the Kennebec River to the west. It is set south of the First Congregational Church of Pittston, on the west side of Arnold Road, an old alignment of Maine State Route 27, which runs just to the east. The house is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a side gable roof, central brick chimney, and clapboard siding. The front facade is five bays wide, with slightly irregular spacing of windows, and a comparatively elaborate front door surround consisting of flanking sidelight windows and pilasters supporting a corniced entablature. History Reuben Colburn and his family settled in Gardinerston (then part of Massachusetts) in 1761. In 1763, he was granted of land and built a saw mill, brick yard, boat yard, and grist mill on the shores of the Kennebec River. In 1765, he built his two-story home on \\"an eminence which gradually slopes down to the shore.\\" Colburn was later described as \\"one of our earliest 'kings of industry.'\\" Colburn assisted George Washington and Benedict Arnold in the planning and provisioning of Arnold's 1775 military expedition through the northern wilderness of Maine to Quebec City. This site was one of the last outposts of support and supply for the expedition. The house passed out of the Colburn family in 1953, after which it underwent some restorative work under private ownership. It was acquired by the state in 1971, and has been operated as a historic site since.

The two known species are within the genus Gigantura. Though rarely captured, they are found in cold, deep tropical to subtropical waters worldwide. The common name of these fish is related to their bizarre, tubular eyes. The genus name Gigantura refers to the Gigantes, a race of giants in Greek mythology--coupled with the suffix oura, meaning \\"tail\\", thus Gigantura refers to the greatly elongated, ribbon-like lower half of the tailfin that may comprise over half of the total body length. Species The currently recognized species in this genus are: * Gigantura chuni A. B. Brauer, 1901 (gigantura) * Gigantura indica A. B. Brauer, 1901 (telescopefish)  Description  The Giganturidae are slender, slightly tapered fish with large heads dominated by large, forward-pointing, telescoping eyes with large lenses. Their heads end in short, pointed snouts. The highly extensile mouth is lined with sharp, slightly recurved and depressible teeth and it extends well past the eyes. The body lacks scales, but is covered in easily abraded, silvery guanine, which imparts a greenish to purplish iridescence in life. The gas bladder is absent and the stomach is highly distensible. The transparent fins are spineless; the deeply forked and hypocercal caudal fin is most striking, with the lower lobe extended to a length exceeding that of the body. The pectoral fins are large (about 30-42 rays), situated above the gill opening, and inserted horizontally. The anal fin (about 8-14 rays) and single dorsal fin (about 16-19 rays) are both situated far back of the head. The pelvic fins and adipose fin are absent. Also absent are the premaxilla, orbitosphenoid, parietal, symplectic, posttemporal, and supratemporal bones, the gill rakers, and the branchiostegal rays. The loss of these structures is attributed to neoteny; that is, the retention of larval characteristics. Gigantura indica is the larger of the two species at about 20.3 cm standard length (a measurement excluding the caudal fin). However, Gigantura chuni (at about 15.6 cm standard length) is slightly more robust in build.  Life history  Telescopefish are presumed to be solitary, active predators, frequenting the mesopelagic to bathypelagic zones of the water column, from 500 to. 3,000 m. By using their tubular, large-lensed eyes--which are adapted for optimal binocular light collection, at the expense of lateral vision-- telescopefish are likely able to spy their prey's weak bioluminescence from a distance, as well as (by looking skyward) resolve the outlined silhouettes of prey against the gloom above. Their eyes may also help telescopefish to better judge distance of prey; these visual adaptations are typical of deep-sea fish (barrel-eye, tube-eye). Common prey include bristlemouths, lanternfish, and barbeled dragonfish. Owing to the telescopefishes' highly extensile jaws and distensible stomachs, they are able to swallow prey larger than themselves; this is also a common adaptation to life in the lean depths (sabertooth fish, black seadevil). Much less is known of their reproductive habits. They are presumed to be nonguarding pelagic spawners, releasing eggs and sperm indiscriminately into the water. The fertilized eggs are buoyant and become incorporated into the zooplankton, wherein they and the larvae remain--likely at much shallower depths than the adults--until metamorphosis into juvenile or adult form.

It is located about 50 km (30 mi.) south of Nuku Hiva, in the northern Marquesas. Until the beginning of the 1980s, it was the most populous of the Marquesas Islands, because when the other islands were being ravaged by diseases introduced by European explorers and traders, the Catholic priests on the island finally took to quarantining the remnant of the native population inside their churches whenever visiting ships approached the island, thereby reducing their exposure to external diseases. The center of the island is characterized by four high basalt pillars that reach high above the surrounding mountains. The highest of these pillars, Mount Oave (Mont Oave), reaches to above sea level and is the highest elevation in the Marquesas. The island covers an area of , and is located just northwest of the small island of Motu Oa.

PopulationHistory Ua Pou is the only major island that was unified under a single monarch prior to the arrival of European explorers. Prior to the island's unification, reportedly about 1585, there is evidence that the tribes of Ua Pou were sometimes united in war with the tribes of Te I'i on Nuku Hiva against those of Tai Pi Vai. Despite the fact that tribes from both the eastern and western halves of Ua Pou were often united in war against each other, however, it appears that such differences among them were not considered when members of tribes from either side of the island sought refuge among the tribes of Te I'i on Nuku Hiva.

The club are currently members of the and play at Rivacre Park. It was originally the works team of the Vauxhall Ellesmere Port Car Plant. It had much success in its local leagues and fought its way up to semi- professional status. It was announced in March 2014 that the club had tendered its resignation from the Football Conference, with effect from the end of season 2013‚Äì14. The club took over their reserve team's place back in the West Cheshire League Division One for the 2014‚Äì15 season. It is generally regarded as the local team of Ellesmere Port, although two other teams, Ellesmere Port and Ellesmere Port Town, play further down the pyramid in the Chester & District League. History Vauxhall Motors F.C. was founded in 1963, shortly after the opening of the new Vauxhall Motors Car Plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. Early in its history, it played in the Ellesmere Port League and the Wirral Combination, but it soon grew too strong for those leagues. By 1970, the club had achieved several promotions and played on the company-owned Hooton Park. By 1987 however, it had opened its own ground, Rivacre Park, where the club plays today. The opening of the new ground was especially important as then England manager Bobby Robson brought a number of former international stars for the opening game. On the pitch, the club also started finding some success, winning its first West Cheshire League championship in the 1985‚Äì86 season. Soon after, they reached their first Cheshire Amateur Cup and triumphed in the Wirral Senior Cup. These accomplishments did not go unnoticed, as the club successfully applied to join the North West Counties League for 1987‚Äì88. They easily won the league's Second Division in their second season at that level, and finished fourth in the First Division in 1989‚Äì90. Despite expectations to challenge for the league title the next season, the team only finished fifth, but won the North West Counties League Cup in the process, defeating Darwen 2‚Äì0. Soon after its fifth-place finish, the board took the decision to move back down to the West Cheshire League where the club finished in third place in the two following seasons. However, in 1994‚Äì95, the club won both divisions of the league ‚Äì only the third time any club had achieved that in the 103-year history of the league. Soon after, they were accepted back into the North West Counties League. Just as before, they easily won the Second Division of the NWCL, but did not have the best of seasons in Division One, although they did reach the semi-final of the Cheshire Senior Cup. It continued to play in Division One, and reached the final of the NWCL Cup, losing to Kidsgrove Athletic in a closely contested match. The 1998‚Äì99 season was the team's best by far to that point, reaching the fifth round of the FA Vase and earning its best ever league position in third place, and won the NWCL Cup. However, the next season was even better, with the team reaching the semi-finals of the FA Vase and winning the NWCL title, thus earning a spot in Division One of the Northern Premier League. The reserves also enjoyed a successful season, winning a number of smaller trophies. The club enjoyed considerable success in the Northern Premier League as well, earning promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division in their first season, and finishing in second place in the league. The team continued to play well, with its high point coming when they defeated Queens Park Rangers in their first appearance in the FA Cup first round, before losing in the next round in a televised match against Macclesfield Town. The season after, the club hired manager Owen Brown and they earned promotion to Conference North when that league was founded in 2004. The club finished twenty-first in the 2007‚Äì08 season, and were due to be relegated but after Nuneaton Borough's liquidation and the Conference's decision to expel Boston United, the club were reprieved. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, the club finished twentieth. However, due to the earlier resignation of Farsley Celtic and the subsequent relegation of Northwich Victoria due to financial troubles, Vauxhall Motors was again given a reprieve from relegation. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, they again qualified for the first round proper of the FA Cup, but were unable to repeat the success of eight years previously, although Josh Wilson scored in the 38th minute, his header was disallowed, drawing 0‚Äì0 against Hartlepool United before going on to lose 1‚Äì0 in the replay. On 26 May 2011 it was announced that, due to a promotion at work, Carl Macauley was stepping down from his role as manager and that his assistant Anthony Wright would be taking over the reins with former Notts County, Peterborough United, Burscough and Vauxhall Motors striker Gary Martindale as his number two. However results didn't go as hoped despite assembling one of the strongest squads the club had seen, resulting in Carl Macauley making a shock return to the Rivacre Park hotseat in November 2011 with Anthony Wright reverting to Assistant Manager and Gary Martindale to First Team Coach. In March 2014 the club announced its intention to withdraw from the Conference North due to \\"ever-increasing costs\\"BBC Sport: Vauxhall Motors to resign from Conference North (accessed 15 March 2014) leaving the club with no alternative but to return to the West Cheshire League to stabilise and rebuild once again for the future. A week after the announcement long-serving manager Carl Macauley left to become Assistant Manager to Steve Burr at Chester F.C., leaving Anthony Wright and Gary Martindale in charge once again until the end of the season. Only four of the founder members of Conference North remained in the league for its first ten seasons: Gainsborough Trinity, Harrogate Town, Stalybridge Celtic and Vauxhall Motors. Vauxhall's league positions in those season's were 15th, 18th, 15th, 21st, 11th, 20th, 17th, 18th, 12th and 18th. On 26 April 2014 Motors played their last game in Conference North for the foreseeable future losing 2‚Äì0 at home to Solihull Moors. In May 2014 former Vauxhall favourite Alan Schumacker was appointed as first team manager. The former Motors defender was a member of Alvin McDonald's all conquering North West Counties League championship side and had been reserve team manager since the summer of 2010. He appointed Kevin Baker as his assistant and Steve Foulkes as coach for the coming season. At the end of the 2015-16 season manager Alan Schumacker and his assistant Kevin Baker left the club and were replaced by former Motors‚Äô assistant manager Anthony Wright and former Mersey Royal Youth team manager Joe Wright as his assistant. However in October Anthony Wright had to step down due to family commitments and a month later Joe Wright left the club. In November 2016 the former Burscough captain, ex A.F.C. Liverpool assistant manager and Prescot Cables Reserve team manager Karl Bell was appointed the club‚Äôs new manager. Colours and badge Vauxhall Motors' colours are white with a strip of blue for the top and navy blue shorts with navy blue socks. The away kit is yellow shirts, green shorts and yellow socks. The kits have been sponsored by car retailer Lookers Wirral since 2000. The team badge is the same as the logo of its parent company, Vauxhall Motors. Stadium Rivacre Park has been the home of Vauxhall since the 1986 season, the club having formerly played at Hooton Park. It has a capacity of 3,300 with covered stand and terracing, with space for 350 seated guests. The stand has been refitted with new seats along with a step in the terrace at the golf course end of the ground. A new toilet block, disabled toilet and a new turnstile block have also been added. To increase capacity, more barriers have been installed to the covered terrace and the club shop has since been re- opened after the roof was damaged in a storm. The ground also has a large sports and social club. This was originally for employees of the Vauxhall plant but is also open to the public on match days etc. Records * Highest League Attendance: 1,752 versus Chester F.C. ‚Äì 30 October 2012 * Highest FA Cup Attendance: 1,109 versus Hartlepool United (FA Cup First Round Replay) ‚Äì 16 November 2010 * Highest FA Trophy Attendance: 1,104 versus Northwich Victoria (FA Trophy 4th Round) ‚Äì 2 February 2002 * Biggest Home Win: 12‚Äì2 versus Blackpool Mechanics, 9 December 1995 * Biggest Home Defeat: 6‚Äì0 versus Kettering Town, 1 March 2008 * Biggest Away Win: 6‚Äì0 versus Hinckley United, 5 February 2013 * Biggest Away Defeat: 6‚Äì0 versus Kettering Town, 25 August 2007 * All-Time Leading Goalscorer: Terry Fearns ‚Äì 111 goals * Most Appearances: Carl Nesbitt ‚Äì 520 appearances (500 starts, 20 as sub) *Best League Position: 11th, Conference North, 2008‚Äì09 *Best FA Cup Performance: 2nd Round Proper, 2002‚Äì03 *Best FA Trophy Performance: 4th Round Proper, 2001‚Äì02 *Best FA Vase Performance: Semi-Finals, 1999‚Äì00 Current squad :As of 28 August 2019.First Team Vauxhall Motors FC Notable players Several players have gone on to play in the Football League, including *Gregg Blundell ‚Äì Formerly with Doncaster Rovers.

Her keel was laid down by the Sevmash shipyard. She was commissioned into the Soviet Pacific Fleet. Collision incident On 13 June 1973, K-56 had completed test launches of her SS-N-3 Shaddock missiles in the Sea of Japan and was returning to port accompanied by the Vladivostok. She was carrying observers on board, including her Division Commander, Captain First Rank L.F. Suchkov, civilian technicians from Leningrad, and a team from her sister boat, , that included her commanding officer, Captain Second Rank L. Homenko. These 36 guests were housed in the second compartment. At approximately 01:00, the boat, running on the surface, rounded Cape Povorotny in Peter the Great Gulf. The navigation crew noted a surface contact on radar about ahead, moving toward them at . Since that was the only contact, and it would be about two hours before the submarine and the contact's combined speeds would bring them near each other, the captain felt no concern. The boat's RLS \\"Albatross\\" radar set had been used at full power throughout the day for the missile launches and now needed maintenance, which required that it be placed in \\"hot standby.\\" The captain gave permission for the radar to be secured, and relied on the lookouts to spot any hazards. Two hours later, the radar was re-energized and four contacts were immediately detected. The operators became confused, attempting to plot courses for the contacts. Three minutes after the radar came on, lookouts spotted a ship's navigational lights. The bridge ordered evasive action, but two minutes later, the research ship Academician Berg, traveling at , struck K-56 on the starboard side, tearing a four-meter hole through the hull into the first and second compartments. As the second compartment rapidly flooded, the officers within shut the watertight doors to prevent flooding the adjacent compartments. When the seawater flooded the battery well, many of the officers and civilians in the second compartment were killed by chlorine gas. The 22 sailors in the first compartment were able to fight the flooding and retain a pocket of air until K-56s captain ran his boat aground on a sandbar. The next day, salvage ships lifted K-56 from the sand bar onto pontoons, and towed her to dock. The investigating board ruled that the collision of Academician Berg with K-56 was a \\"navigation incident with serious consequences.\\" A civilian expert from Leningrad, 16 officers, five warrant officers, and five sailors were killed.

It has also been described as its paramilitary wing. The Fruit of Islam wear distinctive blue or white uniforms and caps and have units at all NOI temples. Louis Farrakhan, as head of the Nation of Islam, is commander-in-chief of the Fruit of Islam, and his son, Mustapha Farrakhan Sr, is second in command. The women's counterpart to the Fruit of Islam is Muslim Girls Training (MGT). The Fruit of Islam draws its membership from male members in Nation of Islam temples.

The agency received contracts primarily to patrol and staff public housing complexes in tough urban areas like Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles and received at least $20 million in the 1990s for security work. NOI Security had notable successes in Washington, D.C. projects particularly, but had difficulty in others and faced opposition by some members of the United States Congress and the Anti-Defamation League, among others.

Among his best-known work is the development of aldol reaction methodology (for example, Evans' acyl oxazolidinone method). Early life and education Evans was born on January 11, 1941, in Washington, D.C.. He received his A.B. from Oberlin College in 1963, where he worked with Norman Craig. He began his graduate work at the University of Michigan with Robert E. Ireland, but moved with the Ireland group to the California Institute of Technology and received his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1967. Academic career Evans began his independent research career at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he joined the faculty in 1967 and became a full professor in 1974. He then moved to the California Institute of Technology and remained there until 1983, when he moved again to Harvard University - a decision he later described as difficult. He was appointed the Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry in 1990, served as chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology from 1995 to 1998, and retired from the faculty, assuming professor emeritus status, in 2008.

Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting). ARIMA models are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity, where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the \\"integrated\\" part of the model) can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity.For further information on Stationarity and Differencing see https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/1 The part of ARIMA indicates that the evolving variable of interest is regressed on its own lagged (i.e., prior) values. The part indicates that the regression error is actually a linear combination of error terms whose values occurred contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The (for \\"integrated\\") indicates that the data values have been replaced with the difference between their values and the previous values (and this differencing process may have been performed more than once). The purpose of each of these features is to make the model fit the data as well as possible. Non-seasonal ARIMA models are generally denoted ARIMA(p,d,q) where parameters p, d, and q are non-negative integers, p is the order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive model, d is the degree of differencing (the number of times the data have had past values subtracted), and q is the order of the moving-average model. Seasonal ARIMA models are usually denoted ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m, where m refers to the number of periods in each season, and the uppercase P,D,Q refer to the autoregressive, differencing, and moving average terms for the seasonal part of the ARIMA model. When two out of the three terms are zeros, the model may be referred to based on the non-zero parameter, dropping \\"\\", \\"\\" or \\"\\" from the acronym describing the model. For example, is , is , and is . ARIMA models can be estimated following the Box‚ÄìJenkins approach. Definition Given a time series data Xt where t is an integer index and the Xt are real numbers, an \\\\text{ARMA}(p',q) model is given by :X_t-\\\\alpha_1X_{t-1}- \\\\dots -\\\\alpha_{p'}X_{t-p'} = \\\\varepsilon_t + \\\\theta_1 \\\\varepsilon_{t-1} + \\\\cdots +\\\\theta_q \\\\varepsilon_{t-q}, or equivalently by : \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^{p'} \\\\alpha_i L^i \\\\right) X_t = \\\\left( 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^q \\\\theta_i L^i \\\\right) \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, where L is the lag operator, the \\\\alpha_i are the parameters of the autoregressive part of the model, the \\\\theta_i are the parameters of the moving average part and the \\\\varepsilon_t are error terms. The error terms \\\\varepsilon_t are generally assumed to be independent, identically distributed variables sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean. Assume now that the polynomial \\\\textstyle \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^{p'} \\\\alpha_i L^i \\\\right) has a unit root (a factor (1-L)) of multiplicity d. Then it can be rewritten as: : \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^{p'} \\\\alpha_i L^i \\\\right) = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^{p'-d} \\\\varphi_i L^i \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - L \\\\right)^d. An ARIMA(p,d,q) process expresses this polynomial factorisation property with p=p'‚àíd, and is given by: : \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i L^i \\\\right) (1-L)^d X_t = \\\\left( 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^q \\\\theta_i L^i \\\\right) \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, and thus can be thought as a particular case of an ARMA(p+d,q) process having the autoregressive polynomial with d unit roots. (For this reason, no process that is accurately described by an ARIMA model with d > 0 is wide-sense stationary.) The above can be generalized as follows. : \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i L^i\\\\right) (1-L)^d X_t = \\\\delta + \\\\left( 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^q \\\\theta_i L^i \\\\right) \\\\varepsilon_t . \\\\, This defines an ARIMA(p,d,q) process with drift \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{1 - \\\\sum \\\\varphi_i} . Other special forms The explicit identification of the factorisation of the autoregression polynomial into factors as above, can be extended to other cases, firstly to apply to the moving average polynomial and secondly to include other special factors. For example, having a factor ( 1 - L^s) in a model is one way of including a non- stationary seasonality of period s into the model; this factor has the effect of re-expressing the data as changes from s periods ago. Another example is the factor \\\\left( 1 -\\\\sqrt{3} L + L^2 \\\\right), which includes a (non- stationary) seasonality of period 2. The effect of the first type of factor is to allow each season's value to drift separately over time, whereas with the second type values for adjacent seasons move together. Identification and specification of appropriate factors in an ARIMA model can be an important step in modelling as it can allow a reduction in the overall number of parameters to be estimated, while allowing the imposition on the model of types of behaviour that logic and experience suggest should be there. Differencing Differencing in statistics is a transformation applied to time-series data in order to make it stationary. A stationary time series' properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. In order to difference the data, the difference between consecutive observations is computed. Mathematically, this is shown as : y_t'= y_t - y_{t-1} \\\\, Differencing removes the changes in the level of a time series, eliminating trend and seasonality and consequently stabilizing the mean of the time series. Sometimes it may be necessary to difference the data a second time to obtain a stationary time series, which is referred to as second order differencing: : \\\\begin{align} y_t^* & = y_t' - y_{t-1}' \\\\ & =(y_t - y_{t-1})-(y_{t-1} - y_{t-2}) \\\\ & =y_ t - 2y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} \\\\end{align} Another method of differencing data is seasonal differencing, which involves computing the difference between an observation and the corresponding observation in the previous season e.g a year. This is shown as: : y_t'= y_t - y_{t-m} \\\\quad \\\\text{where } m=\\\\text{duration of season}. The differenced data is then used for the estimation of an ARMA model. Examples Some well-known special cases arise naturally or are mathematically equivalent to other popular forecasting models. For example: * An ARIMA(0, 1, 0) model (or model) is given by X_t = X_{t-1} + \\\\varepsilon_t ‚Äî which is simply a random walk. * An ARIMA(0, 1, 0) with a constant, given by X_t = c + X_{t-1} + \\\\varepsilon_t ‚Äî which is a random walk with drift. * An ARIMA(0, 0, 0) model is a white noise model. * An ARIMA(0, 1, 2) model is a Damped Holt's model. * An ARIMA(0, 1, 1) model without constant is a basic exponential smoothing model. * An ARIMA(0, 2, 2) model is given by X_t = 2X_{t-1} - X_{t-2} +(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta - 2) \\\\varepsilon_{t-1} + (1-\\\\alpha)\\\\varepsilon_{t-2} + \\\\varepsilon_{t} ‚Äî which is equivalent to Holt's linear method with additive errors, or double exponential smoothing.  Choosing the order To determine the order of a non-seasonal ARIMA model, a useful criterion is the Akaike information criterion (AIC) . It is written as : \\\\text{AIC} = -2\\\\log(L)+2(p+q+k), where L is the likelihood of the data, p is the order of the autoregressive part and q is the order of the moving average part. The k represents the intercept of the ARIMA model. For AIC, if k = 1 then there is an intercept in the ARIMA model (c ‚â† 0) and if k = 0 then there is no intercept in the ARIMA model (c = 0). The corrected AIC for ARIMA models can be written as :\\\\text{AICc}= \\\\text{AIC}+ \\\\frac{2(p+q+k)(p+q+k+1)}{T-p-q-k-1}. The Bayesian Information Criterion can be written as :\\\\text{BIC}= \\\\text{AIC}+((\\\\log T)-2)(p+q+k). The objective is to minimize the AIC, AICc or BIC values for a good model. The lower the value of one of these criteria for a range of models being investigated, the better the model will suit the data. The AIC and the BIC are used for two completely different purposes. While the AIC tries to approximate models towards the reality of the situation, the BIC attempts to find the perfect fit. The BIC approach is often criticized as there never is a perfect fit to real-life complex data; however, it is still a useful method for selection as it penalizes models more heavily for having more parameters than the AIC would. AICc can only be used to compare ARIMA models with the same orders of differencing. For ARIMAs with different orders of differencing, RMSE can be used for model comparison. Estimation of coefficientsForecasts using ARIMA models The ARIMA model can be viewed as a \\"cascade\\" of two models. The first is non-stationary: : Y_t = (1-L)^d X_t while the second is wide-sense stationary: : \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i L^i \\\\right) Y_t = \\\\left( 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^q \\\\theta_i L^i \\\\right) \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, . Now forecasts can be made for the process Y_t, using a generalization of the method of autoregressive forecasting. Forecast intervals The forecast intervals (confidence intervals for forecasts) for ARIMA models are based on assumptions that the residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed. If either of these assumptions does not hold, then the forecast intervals may be incorrect. For this reason, researchers plot the ACF and histogram of the residuals to check the assumptions before producing forecast intervals. 95% forecast interval: \\\\hat{y}_{T+h\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\, T}\\\\pm1.96\\\\sqrt{v_{T+h\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\, T}}, where v_{T+h\\\\mid T} is the variance of y_{T+h} \\\\mid y_1,\\\\dots,y_T. For h=1, v_{T+h\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\, T}=\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2 for all ARIMA models regardless of parameters and orders. For ARIMA(0,0,q), y_t=e_t+\\\\sum_{i=1}^q\\\\theta_ie_{t-i}. : v_{T+h\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\, T} = \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2 \\\\left[1+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{h-1}\\\\theta_ie_{t-i}\\\\right], \\\\text{ for } h=2,3,\\\\ldots In general, forecast intervals from ARIMA models will increase as the forecast horizon increases. Variations and extensions A number of variations on the ARIMA model are commonly employed. If multiple time series are used then the X_t can be thought of as vectors and a VARIMA model may be appropriate. Sometimes a seasonal effect is suspected in the model; in that case, it is generally considered better to use a SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) model than to increase the order of the AR or MA parts of the model. If the time-series is suspected to exhibit long-range dependence, then the d parameter may be allowed to have non-integer values in an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model, which is also called a Fractional ARIMA (FARIMA or ARFIMA) model. Software implementations Various packages that apply methodology like Box‚ÄìJenkins parameter optimization are available to find the right parameters for the ARIMA model. * EViews: has extensive ARIMA and SARIMA capabilities. * Julia: contains an ARIMA implementation in the TimeModels packageTimeModels.jl www.github.com * Mathematica: includes ARIMAProcess function. * MATLAB: the Econometrics Toolbox includes ARIMA models and regression with ARIMA errors * NCSS: includes several procedures for \`ARIMA\` fitting and forecasting.ARIMA in NCSS,Automatic ARMA in NCSS,Autocorrelations and Partial Autocorrelations in NCSS * Python: the \\"statsmodels\\" package includes models for time series analysis ‚Äì univariate time series analysis: AR, ARIMA ‚Äì vector autoregressive models, VAR and structural VAR ‚Äì descriptive statistics and process models for time series analysis. * R: the standard R stats package includes an arima function, which is documented in \\"ARIMA Modelling of Time Series\\".

He played with many leading jazz musicians over a career of sixty years. Drootin was born near Kiev, Ukraine and moved to Boston, Massachusetts with his family when he was five. His father played the clarinet and two of his brothers as well as his nephew were also musicians. Drootin began playing drums professionally as a teenager. At age twenty, he toured with the Jess Stacy All-Stars, a group that featured Lee Wiley. He also toured with Ina Ray Hutton around the same time. He then joined the band of Chicago jazz musician Wingy Manone. From 1947 until 1951, he worked as the house drummer at Eddie Condon's night club in New York. In the 1950s and 1960s he worked in clubs in New York, Chicago and Boston. He did a stint as bandleader at New York's El Morocco Club. He and his brother Al were in the house band at George Wein's Storyville in Boston during the early and mid 1950s. In those years he played with musicians including Bobby Hackett, Jimmy McPartland, Doc Cheatham, Vic Dickenson, Claude Hopkins, Arvell Shaw and Pee Wee Russell. He also recorded with Tommy Dorsey, Bobby Hackett, Jack Teagarden, Eddie Condon, Ruby Braff, Anita O'Day, George Wein, The Newport All-Stars, Lee Konitz, Sidney Bechet, PeeWee Russell and The Dukes of Dixieland. In 1968/69 he toured and recorded with Wild Bill Davison's Jazz Giants and then formed \\"Buzzy's Jazz Family\\" borrowing some of Wild Bill's sidemen (Herb Hall, Benny Morton) and adding Herman Autrey on trumpet and his nephew Sonny Drootin on piano. In 1973, after touring Europe and America, he returned to his hometown of Boston where he and his brother Al (sax and clarinet), and nephew Sonny formed the Drootin Brothers Band. They played at the Newport Jazz Festival. Buzzy played at the very first Newport festival and at many of the festivals after that. He also played at the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival in the 1980s. Drootin backed up many musicians over the years including Wild Bill Davison, Maxine Sullivan, Teddi King, Roy Eldridge, Joe Venuti, and Zoot Sims. He appears as a sideman on numerous recordings including with the bands of Bobby Hackett, Jack Teagarden and the Newport Jazz Festival All-Stars.

It helps both the customer and supplier organization to achieve the desired quality using the corresponded amount of time and money by providing methods and best practices for risk management, contract management, and planning. ISPL focuses on the relationship between the customer and supplier organization: It helps constructing the request for proposal, it helps constructing the contract and delivery plan according to the project situation and risks, and it helps monitoring the delivery phase. ISPL is a unique Information Technology method because where most other Information Technology methods and frameworks focus on development (e.g. DSDM, RUP), ISPL focuses purely on the procurement of information services. The target audience for ISPL consists of procurement managers, acquisition managers, programme managers, contract managers, facilities managers, service level managers, and project managers in the IT (Information Technology) area. Because of ISPL's focus on procurement it is very suitable to be used with ITIL (for IT Service Management) and PRINCE2 (for Project Management).This article is a part of the Method Engineering Encyclopedia of the Utrecht University.  Benefits  There are four main benefits of using ISPL. * The customer can take advantage of the competitive market * Proposals of suppliers become comparable * The use of a strategy that really fits the situation * The contract can be used as a control instrument These benefits are elaborated in the paragraphs below. The customer can take advantage of the competitive market ISPL helps the customer organisation to construct the Request for Proposal (RFP). It even provides the customer organisation with a table of contents. A very important part of the ISPL request for proposal is the elaboration on the supplier evaluation approach. The complete transparency of the supplier evaluation approach triggers the candidate supplier organisations to issue a really competitive proposal. As a result, the customer can take full advantage of the competitive market. Proposals of suppliers become comparable ISPL specifies the table of contents of the candidate supplier organisation's proposal. It also supplies the customer and candidate supplier organisations with one clear terminology. This makes the proposals of the candidate suppliers very easy to compare. The use of a strategy that really fits the situation ISPL provides the user with a really extensive risk management process. Based on best practices, it helps the management to design a delivery strategy that really fits the situation of both the customer and the supplier organizations. This is a benefit for both the customer and the supplier organizations because selecting a suboptimal strategy obviously brings along higher costs. The chapter #Service Planning describes the situation and risk analysis and the design of a service delivery strategy. Contract as a control instrument ISPL helps the customer and supplier organisations to set up a contract that specifies all critical aspects of the procurement. For example, the list of requirements, the budget and the delivery plan are all fixed in the contract. This provides both customer and supplier organisation with a very powerful control instrument. One of the benefits for the customer organisation is that the supplier organisation will be highly motivated to meet all the deadlines because otherwise the supplier commits contract breach. One of the benefits for the supplier organisation is that it becomes much harder for the customer organisation to change the requirements which would slow down the development process. In short, with ISPL there is a better control of costs and time-scales.  History  ISPL is developed and published in 1999 by a consortium of five European companies: EXIN and ID Research (ORDINA) from the Netherlands, FAST from Germany, SEMA from France and TIEKE from Finland. The development of ISPL was part of the SPRITE-S2 programme that was launched in 1998 by the European Commission. ISPL is derived from Euromethod and based on the research of about 200 real-life acquisitions.  Structure  Although ISPL is a best practice library it does not only consist of books. The structure of ISPL is displayed in Figure 1. In this figure the books are represented by squares and the other tools are represented by circles. The basis is formed by four practical books, the IS Procurement Management Essentials. Additionally, a specific book addresses public procurement. Plug-ins to the IS Procurement Management Essentials are provided for specific needs and situations. Currently, three plug-ins are available for which there is a large market potential. A fourth plug-in on the acquisition of product software is currently under construction. Follow the links below to get more information on the different parts of ISPL. * #Managing Acquisition Processes * #Specifying Deliverables * #Managing Risks and Planning Deliveries  Meta-Process Model  Figure 2 illustrates the meta-process model of ISPL. This model can be used to easily link and compare ISPL to other Information Technology methods and frameworks. I will provide each process with a link to more information. Define requirements The definition of requirements is out of the scope of ISPL. For more information on defining requirements I would like to refer to the entry on Requirements management processes. Specify deliverables Both customer and supplier organisation have to specify the information and services they want to receive from the other party. More information on the specification of deliverables can be found in the chapter on #Specifying Deliverables. Situation Analysis, Identify Risks, Select Strategy The customer organisation has to conduct a situation analysis to be able to identify critical risks and mitigate them using an appropriate delivery strategy. More information can be found in the chapter '#Managing Risks and Planning Deliveries'. Make decisions During the execution of the delivery plan the customer and supplier make decisions at each decision point. This is the #Contract Monitoring phase.  Acquisition Process Sequence  This chapter provides a high-level description of the ISPL acquisition process from a customer-supplier-interaction point-of-view. Figure 3 illustrates the sequence of customer and supplier processes during the acquisition. The following paragraphs link the processes in Figure 3 to the theoretical information that is present in this entry and thus provide a link from practise to theory. Make RFP To construct a request for proposal the customer first needs to describe the acquisition goal and other requirements, and perform a situation and risk analysis. Using the risk analysis a delivery plan has to be constructed. More information on all of these activities can be found in the chapter #Managing Risks and Planning Deliveries and the paragraph #Acquisition initiation in the chapter #Managing Acquisition Processes. The request for proposal is a #Tendering deliverable. Make proposal The supplier company writes a proposal in which it clarifies how it can fulfil the acquisition goal. More information on proposals can be found in the paragraph #Tendering deliverable. Select The customer selects a supplier. The selection activity is an important step in the #Tendering process, part of the #Procurement process. Negotiate contract Customer and supplier negotiate the contract. Usually this means that the delivery plan is refined to a more detailed level. The information in the chapter #Managing Risks and Planning Deliveries can be used to update the delivery plan. Make decisions For each contract the delivery plan is executed. Customer and supplier make decisions at each decision point. For an individual contract the final decision is whether #Contract Completion is reached. The deliverables used in this phase are of the #Decision point deliverable type. The final decision of the complete acquisition process is the #Acquisition completion.  Managing Acquisition Processes  The ISPL Acquisition Process is the actual process of obtaining a system or service to achieve a goal contributing to business objectives and/or needs. It is one of the most important parts of the ISPL method. This chapter is a summary of [2].  Model  Figure 4 displays a model of the ISPL acquisition process. The acquisition process consists of three sequential process steps. # Acquisition initiation # Procurement (one or more) # Acquisition completion These individual process steps are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below.  Target domain and service domain  In ISPL the terms target domain and service domain are used quite frequently. Target domain The target domain is the part of the customer organization that is affected by the service. Service domain The service domain is the service organization that delivers the service, i.e. the supplier.  Acquisition initiation  The first process to be executed by the customer contract authority within an acquisition is the acquisition initiation process. It consists of two sequential process steps: acquisition goal definition and acquisition planning. The final result of the process is an acquisition plan reflecting an acquisition strategy, along with a clear understanding of systems and services requirements defining the acquisition goal. The acquisition initiation process is illustrated in Figure 5. A more detailed description of the Acquisition Initiation phase can be found here. = Acquisition goal definition = The result of this step is a sufficiently clear understanding of the requirements to the systems and services that are the goal of the acquisition and the costs and benefits for the business and its various stakeholders. This process step consists of four activities: # Define the target domain. # Refine the definition of the acquisition goal in terms of systems and services requirements. # Analyse costs and benefits. # Analyse stakes and stakeholders. The input of business needs is ideally provided by Requirements management processes. = Acquisition planning = The goal of this phase is to define an acquisition strategy adapted to the situation, plan the main decision points of the acquisition, and establish the acquisition organisation. The acquisition planning phase consists of the following activities: # Determine overall service delivery scenarios. # Analyse risks. # Design acquisition strategy within the risk management framework: # Plan the main decision points of the acquisition. # Setting-up the customer organisation within the acquisition Steps two to four are discussed in detail in the chapter #Managing Risks and Planning Deliveries. Both the acquisition goal definition and acquisition planning are activities within the phase of Acquisition Initiation. A more thorough entry of this phase can be found here.  Procurement process  The procurement step of the ISPL acquisition process embodies the obtaining of one single contract. Note that the acquisition itself can contain multiple procurements. Such a contract consists of one or more projects or ongoing services. The procurement step consists of three sequencing processes: # Tendering # Contract monitoring # Contract completion = Tendering = The aim of the tendering process is to select a supplier and a proposal for the considered services and systems and to agree with the chosen supplier on a contract in which both parties‚Äô deliveries and responsibilities are defined. A very important aspect of such a contract is the planning of the decision points. The tendering process consists of four different steps: # preparation of request for proposal # response preparation # supplier selection # contract preparation and signing = Contract Monitoring = This process aims to monitor the services defined in the contract. It has to ensure that the deliverable and services conform to the requirements in the contract. The most important activity of the contract monitoring process is the execution of the decision points. In the decision point execution the customer organization makes judgments and decisions based on the status of the procurement at any given time. = Contract Completion = The aim of this process is to ensure that all outstanding technical and commercial requirements in the procurement contract (that was written and signed in the tendering phase) have been met.  Acquisition completion  This is the formal completion of all the contracts of the acquisition. The acquisition manager (often this is the customer company's contract authority) has to verify the successful conclusion of all contracts and the achievement of the acquisition goal. The acquisition completion process consists of four activities: # Check that all contracts have been completed # Assess the achievement of the acquisition goal # Decide whether the acquisition is complete # Write an acquisition report The following paragraphs elaborate on the different activities of acquisition completion. = Check that all contracts have been completed = The acquisition manager has to check the completion of the different contracts by checking if each individual contract's completion phase has been achieved and the required reports are written. If necessary the acquisition manager has to trigger the contract completion process for contracts that need it. = Assess the achievement of the acquisition goal = Unfortunately, when all individual contracts‚Äô goals are reached this does not automatically mean that the acquisition goal is achieved. In this activity of the acquisition completion the acquisition manager has to verify the customer company's business objectives have been met and there are no missing parts in the acquisition that have been overlooked. = Decide whether the acquisition is complete = Based on the assessment of the contract completions and the achievement of the acquisition goal the decision whether the acquisition is complete is made. This decision is generally made by the acquisition manager together with representatives of all the organizational authorities concerned with the acquisition. When one or more contracts are not completed or the acquisition goal is not reached this decision requires the involvement of the customer company's organizational authorities. = Write an acquisition report = The acquisition manager has to write an acquisition report. This report's purpose is to record all decisions made during the acquisition process, the level of acquisition completion, and lessons-to-be-learned for future acquisitions. Interesting data to be included in the acquisition report: * Real costs and duration versus budget and planning * Problems and their solution * Risks and an assessment of the used actions and strategies to mitigate them * Required expertise * Effectiveness of the delivery pans * Quality of the suppliers The whole idea behind the extensive acquisition report is that an enterprise can only learn from its faults and experiences when these are well documented available in relevant future situations.  Managing Risks and Planning Deliveries  ISPL's form of risk management is purely based on heuristics. By describing and analyzing the situation, critical risks can be identified and mitigated by selecting actions and an appropriate strategy. ISPL provides heuristics that link risks and situational factors to mitigating actions and strategies. This chapter is a summary of [3] and also includes information from [4].  Model  The process of managing risks and planning deliveries is illustrated in Figure 6. All the different steps in the process are described in detail in the paragraphs below.  Service Description  The first step of the process is describing the service that is to be procured. It is important to note the differences between a project and an ongoing service. Both types of services are described differently. ISPL provides the user with two separate sets of guidelines = Description of ongoing services = There are two steps in describing an ongoing service. I will briefly elaborate on each of these steps in the following paragraphs.  Identify type of service  ISPL proposes two methods for identifying the type of service: * ISO Life Cycle Processes (ISO- LCP) * Public domain service packages These methods can be used in a successive way where the ISO-LCP standard is used to identify the different process types and public domain service packages are used to refine the ISO- LCP processes. An example of a publicly available description of service packages is the one that is present in ITIL. Note that in ITIL, service packages are referred to as processes. More info on the ISO-LCP standard can be found in the Wikipedia entry on ISO/IEC 12207.  Describe service properties  The service can be described in more detail by its service properties. All service properties can be divided into three groups: * Investment properties * Functional properties * Quality properties ISPL provides methods for describing all three groups of properties. = Description of projects = Projects are described by an initial and a final state, i.e. the current and the desired situation. This is done by specifying the operation items (the actual parts of the Information service to be procured), and specifying the descriptive items (documentation). A short outline of documenting the initial and final state is given in the paragraphs below. More information on describing operation and descriptive items is given in the chapter #Specifying Deliverables.  Document the initial state  For each component of the Information Service, contents and quality of the operation items have to be described. Secondary, an assessment has to be made on which already present descriptions of future operational items are relevant to use in the project.  Document the final state  All the operational items that will be in use at the final state have to be documented. When describing these operation items the focus should be on: * The difference between new operational items and ones that are adapted from initial operational items * Specification of manuals and support documentation * Conversion and migration of existing data into new operational items * Specification of interfaces with new and already present operation items Not only the operational items have to be described: Descriptions of the documentation of the Information Service that is to be procured are also necessary. The client has to describe the profiles of the documentation needed for maintenance on, and further development of the Information service.  Service Planning  The service planning process consists of three sub- processes. These are: * Situation and risk analysis * Delivery strategy design * Decision point planning In practice, these three sub-processes are followed by a process of risk monitoring that can give input to the situation and risk analysis process. = Complexity and uncertainty = The terms complexity and uncertainty are used quite often in this chapter. Complexity In the context of ISPL, complexity can be regarded as the difficulty encountered in managing the available knowledge. Uncertainty In the context of ISPL, uncertainty can be regarded as the lack of available knowledge. = Situation and risk analysis = The analysis sub-process is divided into a situation analysis followed by a risk analysis.  Situation analysis  The situation of both the customer and supplier organizations has a lot of influence in the success of the Information Service acquisition process. The situation analysis is all about identifying situational factors and their values. A situational factor value says something about the relative contribution to the overall complexity or uncertainty of the service to be delivered. For both complexity and uncertainty it can have one of the following values: high, low or medium. The ISPL method provides a set of tables which aids the user in determining the situational factor values. An example of a part of such a table can be found in Table 1. The risk management strategy depends on the situation as is displayed in Figure 7. When all the situational factor values are determined it is possible to determine the overall complexity and uncertainty of the service. These two factors can be used by the manager for the Design of the service delivery strategy.  Risk analysis  In the #Situation analysis, complexity and uncertainty values have been attributed to each of the situational factors. In the Risk Analysis, these values are used to identify the possible risks and their probability. Examples of possible risks for the customer business are unpredictable/increased costs for the business, delays in system delivery and poor quality of service or system. Examples of possible risks affecting the quality of the service to be delivered are demotivate of service actors, unclear requirements and uncertain interfaces with other services or systems. ISPL provides tables that map situational factors to risks. An example of such a table can be found in Table 2. For each of the risks found, both the probability and impact, i.e. the consequence, are assessed. The product of these two values is called the risk exposure. The risk exposure value is used to identify the risks that are critical to service delivery. The critical risks influence the #Delivery strategy design and the #Decision point planning. = Delivery strategy design = This process uses the service description, the situation analysis and the risk analysis as inputs to define an optimal service delivery strategy. The resulting service delivery strategy consists of three elements: * A list of actions to mitigate risks * Service execution approach * Service control approach.  Define actions  ISPL provides heuristics on how to mitigate risks and change the individual situational factors that cause them. An excerpt of these heuristics can be found in Table 3.  Service execution approach  The service execution approach determines how the service is executed. For projects, the service execution approach is referred to as the development approach. It consists of a description approach, a construction approach and an installation approach. ISPL provides the user with heuristics on what type of description, construction and installation approach fits best to the situational factors and critical risks found in the #Situation analysis and #Risk analysis. For example, ISPL advises to use an evolutionary construction and installation approach when both overall complexity and uncertainty are high.  Service control approach  The selection of a service control approach is based on the situational factors and overall complexity and uncertainty found in the #Situation analysis. ISPL provides heuristics on which types of control are most suitable for various situational factors. In total there are six types of control: development, quality and configuration in a formal and frequent variant.  Check consistency and analyse impact  After defining a complete service strategy the consistency between the chosen strategy options has to be checked and possibly some choices have to be adjusted. The impact of the chosen strategy should also be analysed by checking that all critical risks have been addressed. It is also that some strategies cause new critical risks. = Decision point planning = The goal of decision point planning is to determine a sequence of decision points and give a clear description on each of the decision points, using the #Delivery strategy design as input. The sequence and contents of the decision points should reflect the chosen service delivery strategy. The decision point planning is made in the following order: # Derive basic sequence of decision points. # Adapt basic sequence to accommodate actions. # Describe decision points.  Derive basic sequence of decision points  The basic sequence of decision points is based on the #Delivery strategy design. ISPL provides heuristics on what basic sequences should be used for different delivery strategy options.  Adapt basic sequence to accommodate actions.  The basic sequence found is adapted to the list of actions to mitigate risks of the #Delivery strategy design.  Describe decision points  ISPL gives information on what information elements should be in a decision point. Think of for instance purpose and the pre-conditions. For every decision has to be determined which deliverables are required. General rule is that the deliverables must contain the right amount of information to be able to make the decision but no more than that. Too much information is costly and blurs the focus of the decision makers. More information about this topic can be found in the chapter on #Specifying Deliverables. = Risk monitoring = Risk monitoring takes place after the #Decision point planning phase. Its results can serve as input for the #Situation and risk analysis phase of service planning if necessary. It involves the tracking, controlling and monitoring of risks and risk mitigating actions.  Specifying Deliverables  ISPL focuses on the relationship between customer and supplier. It is very important that the communication between both parties is clear and unambiguous. A deliverable is a product that is exchanged between the supplier and customer organisations (both ways). Deliverables are exchanged in all phases of the acquisition process: e.g. the Request-For-Proposal during the tendering phase, the intermediate versions during the execution of the delivery plan, and the declaration of contract completion at the end of each contract. ISPL provides guidance for the specification of all deliverables needed in the acquisition process. This chapter is a summary of [5].  Types of deliverables  ISPL divides deliverables in various types, each with a defined set of properties. These properties characterise the knowledge that is captured by each type of deliverable. Figure 8 illustrates the different types of deliverables.  Contract domain deliverables  Contract domain deliverables are used to define and control all contracts in a procurement. There are two types of contract domain deliverables: the tendering deliverable and the decision point deliverable. In the following paragraphs each of these types is discussed in detail. = Tendering deliverable = Tendering deliverables are used in the tendering process to place requirements on all of the services within a procurement. There are four types of tendering deliverables: * Request for proposal * Response * Supplier evaluation report * Contract ISPL provides the customer and supplier organisations with templates for each of the different types. It is important to note that all of the tendering deliverables include the delivery plan in which all delivery and decision points are fixed. = Decision point deliverable = Decision point deliverables support the decision making during the execution of the delivery plan in the #Contract Monitoring phase. There are two types of decision point deliverables: * Decision point proposal * Decision point report Each of these types has its own, more specified subtype. The contract status report is a subtype of decision point proposal that describes the current status of a contract. The contract completion report, a subtype of the decision point proposal, records whether the contract has successfully achieved its business goals. ISPL provides the tables of content of each of the decision point deliverable types and subtypes.  Service domain deliverables  Service domain deliverables describe the service domain (see paragraph #Target domain and service domain for more information). They are delivered by both customer and supplier organisations to plan and control services. There are two types of service domain deliverables: service plans and service reports. = Service plan = A service plan provides information on how to meet identifies goals in terms of service levels, deliverables, schedules, resources and costs. It can for instance give guidance on how to reach targets. ISPL describes the different properties that can be included in the service plan. = Service report = In contrast to the service plan, the service reports controls the service status by reviewing service levels and results. It records the service's productivity and proposes corrective actions. ISPL gives guidance on which information should be included for each property that is described in the service report.  Target domain deliverables  The target domain is described using target domain deliverables. There are two different types of target domain deliverables: operational items and descriptive items. Both will be discussed in the following paragraphs. = Operational item = An operation item is a delivered system or system component that is or will be installed as part of the acquisition. They contribute to the functioning of the target domain. Some examples of different operational item types are listed below. * facilities * hardware devices * application software * physical data * user and operator manuals * trained actors In practice, descriptions of operational items often already present. It is important to make the distinction between functional and quality properties. = Descriptive item = A descriptive item captures knowledge about the target domain. They can be used to describe business organisations, business processes, information services et cetera. ISPL gives guidance on describing descriptive items by providing a descriptive item profile in which all properties of the descriptive item can easily be ordered.

The Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 616 is also located in the village. During the summer months the community offers 2 beaches, recreational boating, water skiing, canoeing, hiking, horseback riding, and cycling. During the winter months there is ice fishing, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, ice skating and horseback riding. A Community Centre is located in the centre of the community, the centre's operation is overseen by the Constance & Buckham's Bay Community Association. The Community Centre includes a free skateboard park along with 2 baseball diamonds (both fully illuminated for night play), soccer fields (full and mini), play-structure, outdoor ice rink, and a concession stand operated by community volunteers.  History  The actual bay was named by French Fur Traders after Simon Constant who was a member of the Algonquin First Nation and who was in the area before white settlers arrived. T.W. Edwin Sowter, a hobby archaeologist from Aylmer, Quebec, first identified the presence of archaeological sites at Constance Bay in the late 1800s. However, details of these sites were not available until Gordon Watson excavated a site in his Constance Bay cottage yard in the early 1970s. Watson's documented his findings in \\"A Woodland Indian Site at Constance Bay\\" available from the Ontario Archaeological Society. One item in the Watson collection is a large reconstructed ceramic vessel dating to about 2,500 years ago. In 1946 St. Gabriel's first chapel opened for services. Father J. Lorne Reynolds appointed parish priest. Hydro (electric service) was brought into the community in the summer of 1951. In the spring/summer of 2005, Enbridge Gas Distribution brought Natural Gas to the community.

It airs a classical music radio format. The station's studios are located in the Fair Park complex in South Dallas. The transmitter site is on West Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill.Radio-Locator.com/WRR-FM WRR operates with a maximum effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the highest output permitted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for non- grandfathered FM stations. It also transmits an HD Radio signal. Despite its ownership by the City of Dallas, WRR is a commercial station and sells advertising to support its broadcasts. Over the years, private broadcasters in the Dallas-Fort Worth radio market have made numerous but unsuccessful calls for privatizing the station. History=Early Years WRR-FM began experimental broadcasts in 1948. It officially signed on the air on October 14, 1949.Broadcasting Yearbook, 1951 edition, page 296. It began operations as a sister station to AM 1310 WRR (now KTCK), which was first licensed for municipal and police transmissions on August 5, 1921.\\"New Stations: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1921. Limited Commercial license with the randomly assigned call letters WRR was issued to \\"City of Dallas (Police and Fire Signal Dept.)\\", which authorized transmissions on the wavelengths of 400, 450 and 500 meters (750, 667 and 600 kHz.) It received an AM band broadcasting station license on March 13, 1922.WRR March 13, 1922 license Limited Commercial license, serial #213, issued to the City of Dallas on March 13, 1922 for a 3 month period for broadcasting on 360 and 485 meters. In its first few decades, WRR-FM mostly simulcast its AM counterpart, and the stations were network affiliates of the Mutual Broadcasting System and carried its schedule of comedies, dramas, news and sports during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" WRR-AM-FM later switched to the NBC Radio Network. Classical Music As network programming shifted to television, WRR-FM began airing classical music full time, while the AM station concentrated on news, talk and information. The City of Dallas sold AM 1310 to Bonneville International in 1978, which switched the call sign to KAAM (today KTCK). Meanwhile, the Dallas government kept WRR-FM, which continued its classical sound.Broadcasting Yearbook, 1979 edition, page C-213. Also in the 1970s, the station increased its power to 100,000 watts, from its previous output of 68,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook, 1980 edition, page C-221. City Council Broadcasts As part of its municipal ownership, WRR began broadcasting Dallas City Council meetings in 1978. They usually take place every other Wednesday at 9 a.m. But Portable People Meter (PPM) evidence showed that the meetings, which interrupted the classical format, caused a significant drop in the station's ratings. The station averages more than 11,000 listeners on weekdays, according to Nielsen Audio. But that number dropped to 1,900 during council meetings.\\"WRR Dropping City Council Broadcasts\\", November 19, 2018, (InsideRadio.com). Retrieved 24-11-2018] In 2018, station management was able to convince the city council to end the broadcasts. The meetings are still available on cable television in Dallas, as well as on line. Unusual Call Letters While most radio stations in Texas have four-letter call signs beginning with a K, this station has three call letters beginning with a W. Many stations going on the air in the early 1920s received three letter call signs. The AM station with which WRR-FM had once been partnered dates back to 1921. WRR on the AM side was the first licensed radio station west of the Mississippi and second in the country. With the introduction of land-based U.S. radio station licensing in late 1912, it had been the practice to assign call signs starting with \\"K\\" in the west and \\"W\\" in the east.\\"K/W Call Letters in the United States\\" by Thomas H. White. (Ship-based stations were just the opposite.) The original boundary line was located along the Texas-New Mexico border, and it wasn't until the shift in early 1923 to the Mississippi River that new stations going on the air in Texas received K instead of W call signs. However, existing stations were allowed to keep their non-conforming call letters. That included such stations as WRR Dallas, WBAP Fort Worth and WOAI San Antonio. When 1310 WRR put an FM station on the air in 1949, the FCC allowed the it to use the same call sign, plus the \\"-FM\\" suffix. After the AM station was sold and its call letters changed to KAAM, WRR-FM dropped the no longer required \\"-FM\\" suffix from its call sign, effective May 15, 1978. Notable Personalities The station was the starting point of John Peel's radio career. Peel, who later became a British disc jockey, notably covered the arraignment hearing of Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before Oswald was shot and killed.

It is also the basis for the design of the subsequent Avalon Hill game, Victory in the Pacific. Game summary Units represented in the game are individual ships of heavy cruiser size or larger, with provisions also given for convoys, submarines (specifically 'U-Boats'), and air power. Each turn represents a period of roughly six months. The board represents the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, which are divided up into six zones. Control of as many of these zones as possible, for as many turns as possible, is the goal of the game. One player assumes the role of the Allied player, and controls the British, Soviet, and American navies. His or her opponent is the Axis player, and controls the German and Italian navies. In addition to the units representing individual ships, both players have one unit each that represents land-based airplane squadrons, and the Axis player has units that represent squadrons of U-Boats.Game rules for War at Sea (Baltimore: Avalon Hill, 1976), p.1 Ships are represented by a single counter which typically gives three factors: gunnery, armor, and speed. While these are the essential statistics for surface vessels, this system keeps them all highly abstracted, as each is just a simple number, falling within a range of 0 to 9. Aircraft carriers have a fourth factor, in this case representing the naval air-power on board. The land-based air units each represent three air attacks (against three different targets).Game rules for War at Sea (Baltimore: Avalon Hill, 1976), p.2 Each turn begins with both players' ships in ports. The Allied player's ports include England, the United States, Leningrad, \\"Russia\\" (actually Murmansk, on the Arctic Ocean), and Malta, in the Mediterranean. The Axis player's ports include Germany, France (after Turn Two, when it is assumed that Germany conquers France by land, just as it did in the real war), and Italy. Each turn, each player (the Allied player first, and then the Axis player) moves all, some, or none of his ships into sea areas that are adjacent to the port in which those ships started the turn. Ships can also attempt to move one additional sea area if the first area was not controlled by the enemy on the previous turn; to accomplish that, the ship must roll a die and get a result less than that ship's speed factor. Ships that have a speed factor of seven or eight are thus automatically able to move two spaces, and are therefore very valuable. The proviso that the first area may not have been controlled by the enemy allows either player (usually the Allied player) to make certain that areas of the sea are unreachable to the enemy fleet due to intervening controlled areas. Ships that remain in port instead of moving are able to repair damage that they may have sustained in previous turns (see the paragraph on combat, below). When the Allied player is finished, the Axis player moves his ships. U-boats are able to move to any sea area and are therefore the only ships that cannot be blockaded by enemy control. If only one player's ships occupy a sea area after movement is finished, that player controls the sea area for the turn, and he or she scores points for it (the number of points varies, depending on which sea area is controlled by which player). If there are ships from both sides in the same sea area, the two fleets must fight at least one round of combat.Game rules for War at Sea (Baltimore: Avalon Hill, 1976), p.3 Combat is resolved with each ship picking a target and rolling one die per gunnery factor, and each 'hit' (generally, a roll of six) is re-rolled to produce the amount of damage generated, which is applied to the target's armor factor. If the amount of damage exceeds the armor factor, the ship is sunk. Air attacks are resolved by rolling one die for each attack at a number of targets equal to the air factor. On a roll of five, the ship is disabled, which means that it is forced to return to port. This method generates a lot of dice rolls, and gave the game the nicknames 'Dice at Sea' and 'Yahtzee at Sea', with critics arguing that it depended too much upon luck, and supporters countering that the high number of die rolls actually allows the luck to even out.Heard at Atlanticon gaming convention, Baltimore, MD, 1987 and 1990 Minor rules include provisions for U-boat combat, the 'neutral port' of South America (which is where disabled ships in the South Atlantic sea area must go, and which they have to leave the following turn, lest the owning player lose points), convoys (which score additional points for the Allied player if they make it to England or Russia), and the possible internment of the Italian fleet if the Allies control the Mediterranean Sea for much of the game.Game rules for War at Sea (Baltimore: Avalon Hill, 1976), p.4 Variations Numerous variations (or 'variants,' to use the word preferred by Avalon Hill) were published for War at Sea in the years since it was released. Many of them appeared in the General, Avalon Hill's house magazine. Among these variations are rules for the French Navy (which is interned early in the war), the Greek Navy, a third Russian port on the Black Sea, Allied mini-submarines (such as the 'X-craft' submarines that were used to attack the German battleship Tirpitz late in the war), and additional ships that were not represented in the original game. These variations add simulation detail to the game (meaning that they made it more like the real war at sea), but at the expense of making it slightly harder to play.War at Sea 2 Expansion Kit (Baltimore: Avalon Hill, 1980) Tournaments During the early 1980s War at Sea was played in Israel as part of a historic educational effort by Bnei Akiva beginning in Rehovot and then in Jerusalem with later to become famous participants such as Israeli media tycoon Shlomo Ben-Zvi and Rosh yeshiva Nehalim Shlomo Lorincz. War at Sea is still played in many competitive tournaments today, including the World Boardgaming Championships, PrezCon, and by PBEM on the BPA Tournament, and PBEM Ladder all for decades running, and still maintains AREA Ratings for players as well.

Life and career Ferris was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Stephen James Ferris, a portrait painter who was a devotee of Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me (after whom he was named) and also an admirer of Mariano Fortuny. He grew up around art; he was trained by his father and his uncles Edward Moran and Thomas Moran were both acclaimed painters. Ferris enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1879 and trained further at the Acad√©mie Julian beginning in 1883 under William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He also met his namesake Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, who greatly influenced his decision to paint scenes from American history. Ferris wrote, \\"[G√©r√¥me's] axiom was that one would paint best that with which he is most familiar\\". His early subjects were Orientalist in nature since that movement was in vogue when he was young. In 1882, he exhibited a painting entitled Feeding the Ibis which was valued at $600. By 1895, he had gained a reputation as a historical painter, and he embarked on his dream of creating a series of paintings that told a historical narrative. In 1898, he sold General Howe's Levee, 1777, but he later realized that such a series could not be complete if the separate paintings could not be kept together. Consequently, he never sold another, but he did sell the reproduction rights to various publishing companies. This had the effect of greatly popularizing his work, as these companies made prints, postcards, calendars, and blank-backed trade cards to use in advertisements. Laminated cards of these works were still being sold as late as 1984. Ferris married Annette Amelia Ryder in 1894, and the couple had a daughter named Elizabeth Mary. He died in Philadelphia in 1930. The Landing of William Penn The paintings showed idealized portrayals of famous moments from American history. The complete series was shown at Independence Hall in Philadelphia from 1913 to 1930, then moved next door to Congress Hall. In later years, it was shown in a number of locations, including the Smithsonian Institution, before being returned to the Ferris family. His works were widely popular for many years, but modern critics are far less generous in their praise. The American Philosophical Society claims that his historical paintings confuse \\"verity with verisimilitude\\", and art historian Gerald Ackerman describes them as \\"splendid in the accuracy of accessories, clothing and especially in the details of land conveyances and ships\\", but \\"extremely dry in execution and rather monotonous in composition.\\" See also * List of Orientalist artists ReferencesExternal links * Category:1863 births Category:1930 deaths Category:19th-century American painters Category:20th-century American painters Category:Alumni of the Acad√©mie Julian Category:American male painters Category:Artists from Philadelphia Category:Orientalist painters Category:Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts alumni ","title":"Jean Leon Gerome Ferris"},{"id":"1510233","text":"Pupils in a traditional classroom situation signal to their teacher that they want to be heard Successful communication between people of different cultures Manual communication systems use articulation of the hands (hand signs, gestures, etc.) to mediate a message between persons.

The crossing would provide a connection linking North America and Eurasia. With the two Diomede Islands between the peninsulas, the Bering Strait could be spanned by a bridge or tunnel. There have been several proposals for a Bering Strait crossing made by various individuals and media outlets. The names used for them include \\"The Intercontinental Peace Bridge\\" and \\"EurasiaAmerica Transport Link\\".A Transcontinental Eurasia-America Transport Link via the Bering Strait , at the 1st International Conference \\"Megaprojects of the Russian East\\" Tunnel names have included \\"TKMWorld Link\\" and \\"AmerAsian Peace Tunnel\\". In April 2007, Russian government officials told the press that the Russian government will back a US$65 billion plan by a consortium of companies to build a Bering Strait tunnel.\\"Russia wants a rail link to North America,\\" Der Spiegel, April 20, 2007  History  Satellite image of Bering Strait. Cape Dezhnev, Russia is on the left, the two Diomede Islands are in the middle, and Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska is on the right.  19th century  The concept of an overland connection crossing the Bering Strait goes back before the 20th century. William Gilpin, first governor of the Colorado Territory, envisioned a vast \\"Cosmopolitan Railway\\" in 1890 linking the entire world through a series of railways. Two years later, Joseph Strauss, who went on to design over 400 bridges, and then serve as the Project Engineer for the Golden Gate Bridge, put forward the first proposal for a Bering Strait rail bridge in his senior thesis.Kevin Starr. Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California, 330. Oxford University Press, 1996. The project was presented to the government of the Russian Empire, but it was rejected.An excerpt from memoirs of the Russian Empire Minister of Land Forces Aleksandr Rediger  20th century  A syndicate of American railroad magnates proposed in 1904 (through a French spokesman) a SiberianAlaskan railroad from Cape Prince of Wales in Alaska through a tunnel under the Bering Strait and across northeastern Siberia to Irkutsk via Cape Dezhnev, Verkhnekolymsk and Yakutsk. The proposal was for a 90-year lease, and exclusive mineral rights for each side of the right-of-way. It was debated by officials and finally turned down on March 20, 1907.Theodore Shabad and Victor L. Mote: Gateway to Siberian Resources (The BAM) pp. 70-71 (Halstead Press/John Wiley, New York, 1977) Czar Nicholas II approved a tunnel (possibly the American proposal above) in 1905. Its cost was estimated at $65 million and $300 million including all the railroads. These hopes were dashed with the outbreak of the 1905 Russian Revolution then World War I. Interest was renewed during World War II with the completion in 194243 of the Alaska Highway linking the remote territory of Alaska with Canada and the continental United States. In 1942, the Foreign Policy Association envisioned the highway continuing to link with Nome near the Bering Strait, linked by highway to the railhead at Irkutsk, using an alternative sea-and-air ferry service across the Bering Strait. At the same time the road on the Russian side was extended by building the 2000 km (1250 mi) Kolyma Highway. In 1958, engineer Tung-Yen Lin suggested the construction of a bridge across the Bering Strait \\"to foster commerce and understanding between the people of the United States and the Soviet Union\\". Ten years later he organized the Inter-Continental Peace Bridge, Inc., a non-profit institution organized to further this proposal. At that time he made a feasibility study of a Bering Strait bridge and estimated the cost to be $1 billion for the span. In 1994 he updated the cost to more than $4 billion. Like Gilpin, Lin envisioned the project as a symbol of international cooperation and unity, and dubbed the project the Intercontinental Peace Bridge.  21st century  According to a report in the Beijing Times in May 2014, Chinese transportation experts had proposed building a roughly long high-speed rail line from northeast China to the United States. The project would include a tunnel under the Bering Strait and connect to the contiguous United States via Canada. Several American entrepreneurs have also advanced private-sector proposals, such as an Alaska-based limited liability company founded in 2010 to lobby for a cross-straits connection and a 2018 cryptocurrency offering to fund the construction of a tunnel. In 2005, investor Neil Bush, younger brother of US President George W. Bush and son of President George H. W. Bush, traveled abroad with Reverend Sun Myung Moon of the Unification Church as he promoted a proposal to dig a transportation corridor beneath the Bering Strait. When questioned by Mother Jones during the Republican primary campaign of his brother Jeb Bush a decade later in 2015, he denied having supported the tunnel project and said that he had traveled with Moon because he supported ‚Äúefforts by faith leaders to call their flock into service to others.‚Äù Technical concerns Bering Strait depth  Depth of water  The depth of the water is a minor problem, as the strait is no deeper than . The tides and currents in the area are not severe.  Weather- related challenges  Restrictions on construction work = The route is just south of the Arctic Circle, and the location has long, dark winters and extreme weather, including average winter lows of and possible lows approaching . This would mean that construction work would likely be restricted to five months of the year around May to September and centered during summer. = Exposed steel = The weather also poses challenges to exposed steel. In Lin's design, concrete covers all structures, to simplify maintenance and to offer additional stiffening. = Ice floes = Although there are no icebergs in the Bering Strait, ice floes up to thick are in constant motion during certain seasons, which could produce forces of the order of on a pier.  Tundra in surrounding regions  Roads on either side of the strait would likely have to cross tundra, requiring either an unpaved road or some way to avoid the effects of permafrost. Likely route and expenses Place for the bridge.  Bridge option  If the crossing is chosen as a bridge, it would probably connect Wales, Alaska to a location south of Uelen. The bridge would also be divided by the Diomede Islands, which are at the middle of the Bering Strait. However, a tunnel would be necessary through the Diomede Islands, as Big Diomede Island is well over at its highest point. In 1994, Lin estimated the cost of a bridge to be \\"a few billion\\" dollars. The roads and railways on each side were estimated to cost $50 billion. Lin contrasted this cost to petroleum resources \\"worth trillions\\". Discovery Channel's Extreme Engineering estimates the cost of a highway, electrified double-track high-speed rail and pipelines, at $105 billion, five times the cost of the Channel Tunnel.  Connections to the rest of the world  This excludes the cost of new roads and railways to reach the bridge. Aside from the obvious technical challenges of building two bridges or a more than tunnel across the strait, another major challenge is that, , there is nothing on either side of the Bering Strait to connect the bridge to. = Russian side = The Russian side of the Strait, in particular, is severely lacking in infrastructure. No railways exist for over in any direction from the strait. The nearest major connecting highway is the M56 Kolyma Highway, which is currently unpaved and around from the strait. However, by 2025, the Anadyr Highway is planned to be built connecting Ola and Anadyr, which is only about from the Strait. = American side = On the American side, probably about of highways or railroads would have to be built around Norton Sound, through a pass along the Unalakleet River, and along the Yukon River to connect to Manley Hot Springs Road - in other words, a route similar to that of the Iditarod Trail Race. A project to connect Nome, from the strait, to the rest of the continent by a paved highway (part of Alaska Route 2) has been proposed by the Alaskan state government, although the very high cost ($2.3 to $2.7 billion, about $5 million per mile, or $3 million per kilometer) has so far prevented construction. In 2016, the Alaskan road network was extended westwards by to Tanana which is from the strait, by building a fairly simple road. The Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities project was supported by local indigenous groups such as the Tanana Tribal Council. =Track gauge= Russia uses a different track gauge from the US and Canada Another complicating factor is the different track gauges in use. Mainline rail in the US, Canada, China, and the Koreas uses standard gauge of 1435 millimeters. Russia uses the slightly broader Russian gauge of 1520 mm. To avoid transshipment difficulties, a new line would likely be built to a single gauge, but causing logistical issues wherever it met the rest of the rail network. On the increasingly popular China‚ÄìEurope rail freight route (which has two breaks of gauge) this is solved by having all cargo in containers which are fairly easily reloaded from one train to another. The TKMWorld Link Map showing the proximity of Chukchi Peninsula in Russia to Seward Peninsula in America The TKMWorld Link (Russian: –¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ö–æ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –º–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å, English: Transcontinental Railway) also called ICL-World Link (Intercontinental link) is a planned 6,000-kilometer link between Siberia and Alaska providing oil, natural gas, electricity, and rail passengers to the United States from Russia. Proposed in 2007, the plan includes provisions to build a tunnel under the Bering Strait which, if completed, would become the longest tunnel in the world, surpassing the Line 3 (Guangzhou Metro) tunnel. The tunnel would be part of a railway joining Yakutsk, the capital of the Russian Yakutia republic, and Komsomolsk-on-Amur, in the Russian Far East, with the western coast of Alaska. The Bering Strait tunnel was estimated to cost between $10 billion and $12 billion, while the entire project was estimated to cost $65 billion. In 2008, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin approved the plan to build a railway to the Bering Strait area, as a part of the development plan to run until 2030. The more than tunnel would run under the Bering Strait between Chukotka, in the Russian far east, and Alaska. The cost estimate was $66 billion. In late August 2011, at a conference in Yakutsk in eastern Russia, the plan was backed by some of President Dmitry Medvedev's top officials, including Aleksandr Levinthal, the deputy federal representative for the Russian Far East. It would be a faster, safer, and cheaper way to move freight around the world than container ships, supporters of the idea believed. They estimated it could carry about 3% of global freight and make about $7 billion a year. Shortly after, the Russian government approved the construction of the $65 billion Siberia-Alaska rail and tunnel across the Bering Strait. Other observers doubt that this will be cheaper than container ships, bearing in mind that the cost for transport from China to Europe by rail is higher than by container ship (except for expensive cargo where lead time is important).Logistics concept for the Chinese growth market (Deutsche Bahn, March 2014) In 2013, the Amur Yakutsk Mainline connecting the Yakutsk railway ( from the strait) with the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed. However, this railway is meant for freight and is too curvy for high-speed passenger trains. Future projects include the and Kolyma‚ÄìAnadyr highway. The Kolyma‚ÄìAnadyr highway has started construction, but will be a narrow gravel road. China‚ÄìRussia‚ÄìCanada‚ÄìUS railway In 2014, reports emerged that China is considering construction of a China‚ÄìRussia‚ÄìCanada‚ÄìUS bullet train that would include a undersea tunnel crossing the Bering Strait and would allow passengers to travel between the United States and China in about two days. Although the press remains skeptical of the project, China's state-run China Daily claims that China possesses the necessary technology, which will be used to construct a tunnel underneath the Taiwan Strait. It is unknown who is expected to pay for the construction, although China has in other projects offered to build and finance them, and expects the money back in the end through fees or rents. Trans-Eurasian Belt Development In 2015, it was reported another possible collaboration between China and Russia that will be part of the Trans-Eurasian Belt Development; a transportation corridor across Siberia that would also include a road bridge with gas and oil pipelines between the easternmost point of Siberia and the westernmost point of Alaska. It would link London and New York by rail and superhighway via Russia if it were to go ahead. China's Silk Road Economic Belt Initiative has similar plans so the project would work in parallel for both countries.

The film adaptation of Be Cool began production in 2003. It was directed by F. Gary Gray, produced by Danny DeVito (who produced and co-starred in the first film), and starred John Travolta, reprising his role from the first film. The film opened in March 2005 and was released to video and DVD distribution on June 7, 2005. This was Robert Pastorelli's final film, as he died one year before its theatrical release. Plot Chili Palmer, restless after years of filmmaking, enters the music industry after witnessing the Russian mob execute his friend Tommy Athens, owner of a record company. Chili offers to help Tommy's widow, Edie Athens, manage the failing business, which owes $300,000 to hip-hop producer Sin LaSalle. Chili is impressed by singer Linda Moon and helps free her from contractual obligations to Nick Carr and Raji, who has a gay Samoan bodyguard named Elliott, an aspiring actor and the butt of Carr and Raji's homophobic jokes. Carr and Raji hire a hitman, Joe \\"Loop\\" Lupino to kill Chili before he can save Edie's company by arranging a live performance for Linda along with Steven Tyler and Aerosmith. Lasalle demands payment of the $300,000, but agrees to give Chili a few days to get the money plus the vig. When the Russians attempt to kill Chili, Joe Loop mistakenly kills Ivan Argianiyev, the Russian Mob's hitman. Carr is furious about the mistake and demands that Raji talks to Loop at once. Raji then kills Loop with a metal baseball bat after Loop \\"disrespects\\" him. Carr then tries to trick Chili by handing him a pawn ticket, claiming that Linda's contract is being held at a pawn shop owned by the Russians. Chili being much smarter than Carr anticipated, has Edie give the ticket to the police, who pay the Russians a visit. Raji and Elliott set up LaSalle by making him believe that Carr tricked Chili in giving him the $300,000 to get Linda's contract. LaSalle and the DubMD confront Carr in his office, as do Bulkin and his men. Insulted by Bulkin's racist remarks, LaSalle kills him. Chili squeezes in a dance scene with Edie (a nod to the \\"Twist Contest\\" scene in Pulp Fiction), celebrating as Linda Moon gets to make her appearance with Aerosmith in concert. Based on Linda's success in that concert, Chili assuages LaSalle by making him her producer. But Carr is not accepting any deal, so he makes Raji put Elliott to kill Chili. By assuring Elliott that he can help his acting career, Chili befriends him. After learning that Chili had gotten him an audition for a Nicole Kidman film, Elliott turns on Raji, who had erased the message on his answering machine. For all his smooth talking and flamboyant wardrobe, Raji finds himself in a firework conflagration which roasts him live on camera. Carr is arrested on murder charges when Chili makes sure he is caught with the bat used to kill Joe Loop, via another pawn ticket. At the MTV Video Music Awards, Linda wins the awards for best new artist and video of the year. During her acceptance speech, she thanks Edie, Sin and Chili. Edie and Chili leave the award ceremony. And as Chili drives off, he passes a billboard revealing that Elliott is the co-star of a new movie with Nicole Kidman.

The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Be Cool is tepid, square, and lukewarm; as a parody of the music business, it has two left feet.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 37 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Halliwell called it \\"a palpable miss, a movie so lazy and laid back that it falls over; there are none of those insights ... that made Get Shorty so enjoyable\\".\\"Halliwell's Film Guide\\" In an August 2015 interview with Deadline, director F. Gary Gray discussed the failure of the film, stating: \\"With Be Cool, I made some assumptions in thinking that movie was going to work. I'd just made a successful PG-13 movie [The Italian Job], and when I walked into Be Cool, it was rated R and then at the last minute in preproduction I was told, 'Well, you have to make this PG-13.' I should have walked off the film. This was a movie about shylocks and gangsta rappers and if you can't make that world edgy, you probably shouldn't do it. I walked in thinking I was going to make one movie and then it changed. Maybe it was arrogant of me to think because I had success in this realm of PG-13 I could make that work\\".https://deadline.com/2015/08/f-gary-gray-straight-outta- compton-q-and-a-1201498938/ ReferencesExternal links  * Category:2005 films Category:2000s crime comedy films Category:2005 LGBT- related films Category:2000s satirical films Category:American crime comedy films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American satirical films Category:American sequel films Category:English-language films Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films based on works by Elmore Leonard Category:Films directed by F.

Following his retirement from wrestling, he made occasional on-air appearances on WWE television and pay-per-views and worked as a backstage booker and producer in WWE's NXT developmental territory. Billed as \\"the son of a plumber\\", Rhodes did not have a typical wrestler's physique; his character was that of the \\"common man\\", known for the personality exhibited in his interviews. WWE chairman Vince McMahon remarked that no wrestler \\"personified the essence of charisma quite like Dusty Rhodes\\". Rhodes was a three-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, and during his time in Jim Crockett Promotions, later known as WCW, he was a United States Heavyweight Champion, and multi-time World Television, World Tag Team and World Six-Man Tag Team Champion. He also won many regional championships, and is one of seven men inducted into each of the WWE, WCW, Professional Wrestling, and Wrestling Observer Newsletter Halls of Fame. His sons, Dustin and Cody, both pursued careers in professional wrestling, performing for WWE and AEW.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1967‚Äì1974)  After graduating from Johnston High School in Austin, Rhodes played baseball at West Texas State (now known as West Texas A&M; University). Turning professional, Rhodes tried out for the American Football League's Boston Patriots but was cut. He then played for the Hartford Charter Oaks in the Continental Football League until the team folded. In 1967, Rhodes saw an advertisement in the newspaper for Tony Santos‚Äô professional wrestling promotion Big Time Wrestling, based in Boston. Rhodes drove to Boston, and despite not having any wrestling experience, bluffed his way into working for the company by using his real life friendships with Bobby Duncum and the Funk brothers. Billed as Dusty Runnels, one of his first matches was for the BTW World Heavyweight title against champion Frank Scarpa in the Boston Arena. Having little money, Rhodes slept in his car and spent Thanksgiving with Rufus R. Jones in a Boston soup kitchen. Rhodes moved on to Fritz Von Erich's Texas territory World Class Championship Wrestling in 1968, at that time also called Big Time Wrestling. It was in Texas where Rhodes first adopted the ring name \\"Dusty Rhodes\\". Upon meeting Rhodes, Gary Hart suggested that he change his ring name to \\"Lonesome Rhodes\\", a character Andy Griffith portrayed in the film A Face in the Crowd. Rhodes reportedly replied: \\"Well...I don‚Äôt plan on being 'Lonesome'. I think I‚Äôll stick with Dusty.\\" Hart took an immediate liking to Rhodes and convinced Von Erich of the young wrestler's potential. Rhodes became a rule-breaking heel with Hart as his manager, teaming with Don Jardine, better known as The Spoiler. Later in 1968, Rhodes left Texas and entered the Kansas City territory, tagging with fellow Texan Dick Murdoch to form the tag team The Texas Outlaws. The team traveled both nationally and internationally, appearing in Big Time Wrestling (Texas), NWA Western States Sports (Texas), NWA Detroit, National Wrestling Federation (NWF), Championship Wrestling from Florida, World Championship Wrestling (Australia), Tri-State Wrestling, the American Wrestling Association (AWA), and International Wrestling Enterprise (Japan).  National Wrestling Alliance territories (1974‚Äì1984)  Rhodes performing his finishing maneuver, the bionic elbow, in 1979 Rhodes did not have a typical wrestlers' physique, but he was well known for his personality, charisma and interviews. In 1974, Rhodes's character became a hero after tag team partner Pak Song and manager Gary Hart turned on him during a match in Florida against Eddie and Mike Graham. This led him to break out as a solo wrestler, primarily in Florida, referring to himself as the \\"American Dream\\", a working class hero, and aligning himself with Eddie Graham. In 1977, Rhodes wrestled for Vince McMahon, Sr.'s World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on and off for lengthy periods of time until 1983. During that time, Rhodes main- evented twice in Madison Square Garden, both times challenging for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship against reigning champion Superstar Billy Graham. Rhodes won the first match on September 26 via countout, and lost the second, a Texas Death match, on October 24. Graham won after a mid-ring collision, falling on Rhodes for the three count.  Jim Crockett Promotions (1985‚Äì1989)  Rhodes battling Harley Race at an NWA event He eventually began working as a booker and wrestler with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in the Mid-Atlantic, which eventually purchased World Championship Wrestling (WCW), formerly Georgia Championship Wrestling. Rhodes also teamed with Magnum T.A. as \\"America's Team\\", who opposed the Four Horsemen and The Russian Team in 1985. They were one of the more dominant tag teams in the promotion until 1986, when Magnum's career was ended in a car accident. Subsequently, he teamed with Nikita Koloff as The Super Powers. Rhodes was also a two time World Six-Man Tag Team Champion with The Road Warriors. Rhodes had feuds with Abdullah the Butcher, Pak Song, Terry Funk, Kevin Sullivan, Blackjack Mulligan, Nikita Koloff, Harley Race, Superstar Billy Graham, \\"Crippler\\" Ray Stevens and, most notably, The Four Horsemen (especially Ric Flair and Tully Blanchard). Rhodes, Flair and Race fought each other many times over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Rhodes won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times; twice by defeating Race and once by defeating Flair. In October 1985, during his feud with Flair, Rhodes gave an interview that became known as his \\"Hard Times\\" promo, arguably his most popular promo: :\\"First of all, I would to thank the many, many fans throughout this country that wrote cards and letters to Dusty Rhodes, The American Dream, while I was down. Secondly, I want to thank Jim Crockett Promotions for waitin‚Äô and takin‚Äô the time ‚Äòcause I know how important it was, Starrcade '85 it is to the wrestling fans, it is to Jim Crockett promotions, and Dusty Rhodes The American Dream. With that wait, I got what I wanted, Ric Flair the World's Heavyweight Champion. I don‚Äôt have to say a whole lot more about the way I feel about Ric Flair; no respect, no honor. There is no honor amongst thieves in the first place. :He put hard times on Dusty Rhodes and his family. You don‚Äôt know what hard times are, daddy. Hard times are when the textile workers around this country are out of work, they got four or five kids and can‚Äôt pay their wages, can‚Äôt buy their food. Hard times are when the auto workers are out of work and they tell ‚Äòem to go home. And hard times are when a man has worked at a job for thirty years, thirty years, and they give him a watch, kick him in the butt and say \\"hey a computer took your place, daddy\\", that's hard times! That's hard times! And Ric Flair you put hard times on this country by takin‚Äô Dusty Rhodes out, that's hard times. And we all had hard times together, and I admit, I don‚Äôt look like the athlete of the day supposed to look. My belly's just a lil‚Äô big, my heiny's a lil‚Äô big, but brother, I am bad. And they know I‚Äôm bad. :There were two bad people‚Ä¶ One was John Wayne and he's dead brother, and the other's right here. Nature Boy Ric Flair, the World's Heavyweight title belongs to these people. I‚Äômma reach out right now, I want you at home to know my hand is touchin‚Äô your hand for the gathering of the biggest body of people in this country, in this universe, all over the world now, reachin‚Äô out because the love that was given me and this time I will repay you now. Because I will be the next World's Heavyweight Champion of this hard time blues. Dusty Rhodes tour, ‚Äò85. :And Ric Flair, Nature Boy‚Ä¶ Let me leave you with this. One way to hurt Ric Flair, is to take what he cherishes more than anything in the world and that's the World's Heavyweight title. I‚Äôm gon‚Äô take it, I been there twice. This time when I take it daddy, I‚Äôm gon‚Äô take it for you. Let's gather for it. Don‚Äôt let me down now, ‚Äòcause I came back for you, for that man upstairs that died 10-12 years ago and never got the opportunity to see a real World's Champion. And I‚Äôm proud of you, thank God I have you, and I love you. Love ya!\\". The promo apparently resonated with wrestling fans so much that people came to him in arenas in tears to thank him for \\"honoring their plight\\". In 2015, an ESPN article referred to \\"Hard Times\\" as Rhodes' best interview, writing, \\"In just over three minutes, Rhodes fully encapsulated every ounce of his charm by endearing himself to blue-collar mid-America\\". During his stint as booker, JCP were engulfed in aggressive competition with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). When the WWF introduced Mike Jones as Ted DiBiase's bodyguard, Bobby Heenan suggested to name the character Virgil as an inside joke on Dusty's real name. Also in the late 1980s, Rhodes became synonymous with what would become known as the \\"Dusty finish\\", a trick ending in which a wrestler would win a match while the referee was knocked out, and the decision would be overturned. Rhodes is often considered to be one of the most innovative and creative bookers in the history of professional wrestling. As previously mentioned, his work in the development of \\"supercards\\" and gimmick matches did much to enhance the quality of entertainment and move the industry forward, as evident by other major promotions following with their own major cards and gimmicks. At the same time, however, he and JCP had an \\"old school\\" philosophy that did not bode well with the changes that were brought with fast moving media such as cable TV, etc. The long-standing storylines and the frequent use of the aforementioned \\"Dusty finish\\", techniques that had worked well during the NWA's territorial days, had now started to leave many fans dissatisfied with the promotion's booking. Rhodes was fired after Starrcade '88, because of a taboo on-screen bloodletting (laid down by the Turner Broadcasting System following their purchase of the company) during a November 26 altercation with The Road Warriors. Furious with the interference, Rhodes booked a storyline in which Road Warrior Animal pulled a spike out of his shoulder pad and jammed it in Rhodes' eye, causing a severe laceration. Rhodes was then fired from WCW. Following this, Rhodes returned to Florida to compete in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), where he captured the PWF Heavyweight Championship and also returned to the AWA for a few appearances.  World Wrestling Federation (1989‚Äì1991)  In mid-1989, Rhodes returned to the WWF as the yellow polka-dotted \\"Common Man\\" Dusty Rhodes, a gimmick some felt was intended to humiliate him due to his synonymy with the rival JCP/WCW. Rhodes was introduced to WWF audiences through a series of vignettes in which he would gregariously and enthusiastically perform working class roles (including that of a plumber, butcher's apprentice, gas station attendant, and pizza delivery man), eventually being recognized by others at the end of the skit (\\"Hey! Aren't you...?\\"). He was managed by Sapphire, who was intended to represent the \\"common woman\\". During his early time in the WWF, Rhodes was embroiled in a heated storyline with \\"Macho King\\" Randy Savage and his manager/partner Sensational Queen Sherri, who in turn found a rival in Sapphire. After a confrontation between the two couples, Savage's ex-manager Miss Elizabeth allied herself with Rhodes and Sapphire and was instrumental in helping them win the WWF's first mixed tag-team match during WrestleMania VI. Sapphire, however, left Rhodes during SummerSlam for The Million Dollar Man's money. Afterwards, Rhodes dropped the polka dots and feuded with Dibiase and Virgil, which also resulted in the national debut of his son Dustin at the 1991 Royal Rumble. Both departed the WWF shortly after, marking the end of Rhodes' career as a full-time in-ring competitor.  Return to WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (1991‚Äì2001)  Rhodes returned to WCW in 1991 as a member of WCW's booking committee, making his first appearance only 11 days after his last WWF appearance at the Royal Rumble. Booking disagreements between Rhodes and Ric Flair led to the latter's return to the WWF and the Big Gold Belt controversy. Rhodes also served as the on-screen manager of Ron Simmons from 1991 to 1992 and was in Simmons' corner on August 2, 1992 when he defeated Big Van Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. He later joined the broadcast team, usually working with Tony Schiavone on Saturday Night. He was paired with Schiavone and Bobby Heenan on pay-per-views. Rhodes was originally on the side of WCW when its battle with the New World Order (nWo) began in 1996. At Souled Out 1998, Larry Zbyszko asked Rhodes, who was working the PPV broadcast, to accompany him to the ring for his match against Scott Hall. Zbyszko won the match by disqualification due to interference by Louie Spicolli. Rhodes entered the ring, delivering his trademark elbow smashes to Spicolli as Zbyszko stood and grabbed Hall. Rhodes went to elbow Hall, but seemingly inadvertently hit Zbyszko instead turning heel in the process. Hall then pointed to Rhodes as he revealed an nWo shirt. The three began to drop repeated elbows on Zbyszko before Rhodes announced \\"That's tradition, WCW! Bite this!\\". Announcer Tony Schiavone left the broadcast booth in shock, but later returned ripping Rhodes for his actions for most of the rest of the night. As a member of the nWo, Rhodes served as the manager of The Outsiders, Hall and Kevin Nash. This lasted until the November 30, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro, when Rhodes, who was guest refereeing a match between Barry Windham and Dean Malenko after being appointed by Eric Bischoff, defected back to WCW by disqualifying Windham and awarding the match to Malenko. Bischoff then fired Rhodes. He left WCW in 2000 and went to Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) where he put over former ECW World Champion, \\"King of Old School\\" Steve Corino. Rhodes returned once more to WCW, re-igniting his feud with Ric Flair.  Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling and other promotions (2000‚Äì2003)  After both WCW and ECW were bought by WWE (WWF), Rhodes went to compete in his own promotion, Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling with ex-WCW and ECW superstars in Georgia, Florida and Tennessee. During this time he feuded with Terry Funk and Steve Corino in other territories. In 2002, Rhodes competed in Pro Pain Pro Wrestling based in Philadelphia feuding with Kevin Sullivan. This would lead to a Texas Bullrope match on November 23 in which Rhodes defeated Sullivan.  Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003‚Äì2005)  Rhodes began appearing with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2003, returning to the ring to feud against the villainous Sports Entertainment Xtreme faction. on the January 15 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes, Road Warriors and Jeff Jarrett lost to Vince Russo and Triple X. on the January 22 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes called out Nikita Koloff to reform the Superpowers, but Nikita turns on him. On the February 26 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes and Vader defeated Don and Ron Harris by disqualification. On the March 19 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes, Jeff Jarrett and D-Lo Brown defeated Erik Watts, Brian Lawler and David Flair in a six-man tag team match a week later Rhodes defeated David Flair in a Bunkhouse match. On the April 9 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes defeated Brian Lawler in a Ladder match. On the August 13 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and America's Most Wanted defeated Glenn Gilbertti and Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger the following week Rhodes lost a bullrope to Glen Gilbertti after Christopher Daniels interfered. On the October 1 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes and Jarrett defeated A.J. Styles and Russo. The following week Rhodes got a shot at the NWA title against Styles but lost when he passed out during the figure-4. On the October 15 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes and America's Most Wanted defeated Legend, Sonny Siaki and Ekmo Fatu. On the November 26 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes and Jarrett wrestled to a no contest in a Lumberjack Fan Strap match. After taking a few months off Rhodes returned on May 19, 2004 where he and James Storm defeated Dallas and Kid Kash in a \\"Bunkhouse Brawl\\" this led to the duo getting a shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship on June 2 but they failed to win the titles. On the June 4 episode of Impact, Rhodes gave an interview with Mike Tenay but got punked out by NWA champ Jeff Jarrett. On the July 14 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes, Larry Zbyszko and 3Live Kru defeated Jarrett, Ken Shamrock, Hernandez, Chad Collyer and Onyx. On the August 25 NWATNA PPV, Russo suspended Rhodes from TNA and banned him from the Asylum a few days later on the August 27 episode of Impact, Rhodes showed up in the front row, and got attacked by Scott D‚ÄôAmore and ejected again. On the September 1 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes under a mask billed as Midnight Rider teamed with Konnan and B.G. James to defeat Team Canada (Eric Young and Bobby Roode and Johnny Devine). On the September 8 NWA-TNA PPV, Rhodes defeated Scott D'Amore with Russo as the special guest referee. On the October 29 episode of Impact, Rhodes started his campaign to replace Vince Russo as the Director of Authority. Later, he became the Director of Authority at their November 7, 2004 pay-per-view, Victory Road. At the same time, Rhodes acted as head booker and writer. On the April 8, 2005 episode of Impact, Rhodes made the on-air decision to make all matches at Lockdown PPV in Six Sides of Steel. Then on the April 29 episode of Impact, Rhodes announced that MMA fighter Tito Ortiz will referee the World title match at Hard Justice (2005). In May 2005, TNA President Dixie Carter asked Rhodes to move onto a creative team, which included Jeremy Borash, Bill Banks, and Scott D'Amore. Rhodes resigned as booker, waiting out the rest of his contract with TNA, which expired soon after.  Independent circuit (2003‚Äì2006)  Rhodes facing Kid Kash in Ballpark Brawl Rhodes made his first indy circuit appearance on April 12, 2003 for Ring of Honor (ROH), when he participated in the \\"I Quit Bunkhouse Riot\\" as a member of Homicide's team. On December 12, Rhodes defeated Jerry Lawler at an International Wrestling Cartel show that also featured Mick Foley as the special guest referee. Rhodes returned to ROH on March 13, 2004, where he competed alongside The Carnage Crew in a Scramble Cage match against Special K, which the Carnage Crew won. On July 24, Rhodes returned to Full Impact Pro (FIP) and defeated Gangrel. In October, he appeared for Northeast Wrestling in a victory over Kamala. Later in the month, he appeared for IWA Mid-South in a tag team match with Ian Rotten in a victory over Chris Candido and Steve Stone. Rhodes made three appearances for the Japanese promotion HUSTLE in 2004, the first being on January 4 in a six-man tag team match with Steve Corino and Tom Howard against Mil Mascaras, Dos Caras, and Sicodelico Jr., which Rhodes' team lost. The second was on March 7, where he teamed with his son Dustin against Shinjiro Otani and Satoshi Kojima, which he also lost. The third was on May 8, where he defeated Corino. Starting in December 2004, Rhodes made regular appearances for Carolina Championship Wrestling (CCW), where his first match for the promotion saw him team up with The Rock 'n' Roll Express to take on Dennis Condrey, Bobby Eaton, and Stan Lane, all three of the best-known members of the Midnight Express. He also briefly resurrected his feud with Tully Blanchard in CCW, earning two consecutive victories over him, the second being in a Bunkhouse Brawl. On April 9, 2005, Rhodes challenged Jeff Jarrett (who was still contracted to TNA, but due to TNA's then-affiliation with the NWA, he was allowed to appear for other affiliated promotions) for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In a match that featured Jimmy Valiant as the special guest referee, Jarrett retained the title after Terry Funk made a surprise appearance and interfered. This led to Rhodes challenging Funk to a Falls-Count-Anywhere Bunkhouse match, which Rhodes won. This would be Rhodes' final appearance with CCW until August, where he would team with his son Dustin against Phi Delta Slam. On July 15, 2005, Rhodes participated in Ballpark Brawl IV in a victory over Kid Kash. Rhodes participated in the first WrestleReunion, competing in an eight- man tag team match with D'Lo Brown, The Blue Meanie, and Tom Prichard against Steve Corino, Andrew Martin, Evil Clown, and the Masked Superstar. Rhodes faced Tully Blanchard at a Starrcade Tribute Show on November 19, where he was managed by Magnum T.A. and where Blanchard was managed by James J. Dillon. Rhodes ended up losing the match. On December 3, 2005, Rhodes returned to Carolina Championship Wrestling for one night only to face Terry Funk in an \\"I Quit\\" match, which Rhodes won. Rhodes made his final major appearances on the independent circuit before returning full-time to WWE in mid-2006, defeating Jerry Lawler by disqualification at a Southern Championship Wrestling (SCW) show and also earning a victory over Steve Corino in a Texas Bullrope match for Big Time Wrestling.  Return to WWE  Rhodes at the 2009 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, inducting the Funk Brothers Rhodes at the 2012 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, inducting the Four Horsemen = Final matches and retirement (2005‚Äì2010) = In September 2005, Rhodes signed a WWE Legends deal and was brought onto the Creative Team as a creative consultant. He made an appearance on the October 3, 2005 WWE Raw Homecoming in which he, along with other legends, beat down Rob Conway, to whom Rhodes delivered a signature Bionic Elbow. Rhodes made an appearance on the June 19, 2006 episode of Raw, appearing in a backstage segment with Vince McMahon where he promoted his new DVD, The American Dream ‚Äì The Dusty Rhodes Story. A few weeks before Survivor Series, Rhodes returned to WWE to be a part of Team WWE Legends, led by Flair. The team, which consisted of Sgt. Slaughter, Ron Simmons, and Arn Anderson (acting as manager) competed against The Spirit Squad at Survivor Series. Rhodes was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 31, 2007 by his two sons, Dustin and Cody. During his acceptance speech, Rhodes asked Ric Flair and Arn Anderson to hold up the \\"sign\\" and induct him and Harley Race into the Four Horsemen. He has also inducted several other people into the Hall of Fame, including his mentor Eddie Graham in 2008, The Funk Brothers (Terry and Dory Funk Jr.) in 2009, The Road Warriors in 2011, and longtime rivals The Four Horsemen in 2012. A few weeks before WWE's 2007 broadcast of The Great American Bash, Rhodes returned to WWE television to feud with Randy Orton. At The Great American Bash, Orton defeated Rhodes in a Texas Bullrope match after hitting Rhodes with a cowbell. This would be Runnels' final WWE match, officially retiring for the first time soon after at age 61. The following night on Raw, after Orton defeated Rhodes' son Cody, Orton delivered a kick to Rhodes' head while he was trying to tend to his son. On the December 10 episode of Raw, Rhodes was at ringside to see Cody and Hardcore Holly defeat Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship. On August 31, 2009, during the time Cody was part of The Legacy with Randy Orton and Ted DiBiase, Rhodes was the special guest host of Raw and booked a match between Cody and Orton for Orton's WWE Championship with John Cena as the special guest referee. It quickly turned out to be a ruse with Dusty's intention to allow Legacy to attack Cena, as well as D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) once they came to make the save. Despite the four standing tall together, Orton quickly gave an RKO to Rhodes, and though initially angered, Cody fell in line behind Orton. On July 9, 2010, Rhodes briefly came out of retirement and wrestled the final match of his career at an FCW live event, where he teamed up with Cody and Goldust to defeat the team of Caylen Croft, Curt Hawkins, & Trent Barreta in a 6-man tag team match. He would again retire shortly after. = Sporadic appearances (2010‚Äì2015) = Rhodes was the head writer and creative director for the weekly NXT Wrestling television broadcast. On September 12, 2013, he was removed as NXT Commissioner. Rhodes made his return to Raw on September 16, 2013 after accepting a \\"business proposition\\" from Stephanie McMahon in an attempt for WWE to rehire both his sons Cody and Dustin. After learning that McMahon would only rehire one son of his choosing, Rhodes turned down the offer and was subsequently knocked out by Big Show on the orders of McMahon. Rhodes also appeared at Battleground in the corner of Cody and Goldust as they took on The Shield (Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns with Dean Ambrose at ringside) in a tag team match. The stipulation of the match would be that if the Rhodes Family won, Cody and Goldust got their jobs with the company back, but if they lose Dusty would be fired as an NXT trainer and none of them could appear on WWE programming ever again. The Rhodes brothers won the match, thus reinstating them to the roster and allowing Dusty to retain his position in NXT. During the match, Dusty got into an altercation with Ambrose and performed the Bionic Elbow on him. Rhodes appeared on the February 16, 2015 episode of Raw, in an effort to reunite Goldust and Stardust, who were engaged in a conflict. Rhodes appeared at Fastlane on February 22, in a backstage segment with Goldust. Rhodes' final appearance on WWE programming would be on March 28, when he appeared on the Hall of Fame: Live From the Red Carpet show.  Personal life  Runnels was married to Sandra from 1965 to 1975. In 1978 he married Michelle Rubio; the couple were married for 37 years until his death in 2015. He had four children: Dustin, Kristin, Teil and Cody Runnels. He had five grandchildren; Dakota, the daughter of Dustin and his ex-wife, Terri Boatright, Dalton and Dylan, children of Kristin and her husband Don Ditto, and Kellan and Maris, children of Teil and her husband Kevin Gergel. He also had a brother, Larry, and a sister, Connie. He played baseball for West Texas State University.  Illness and death  In his later years, Rhodes suffered from kidney failure. On June 10, 2015, paramedics responded to Rhodes' home in Orlando, Florida, after getting a call reporting that he had fallen. They drove him to a nearby hospital, where he died the next day at the age of 69 from kidney failure. Rhodes was cremated after his death, and his ashes were spread in November 2015 by his son Dustin on a ranch that Rhodes loved to visit. At the 2015 Money in the Bank pay-per-view event, a ten-bell salute was given in honor of Rhodes, with the entire WWE roster and the McMahon family on the entrance ramp. The next night on Raw, they honored him with a video tribute and a special after Raw on the WWE Network. At the NXT tapings following his death, he was honored with another ten-bell salute. Legacy In August 2015, WWE's NXT introduced the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, a tag team tournament in honor of Rhodes. The tournament has been held annually since, with three editions having taken place as of March 2019. All Elite Wrestling named their \\"Go Position\\" (best known as the Gorilla Position), \\"The Dusty Position\\" after him on October 16, 2019. In the promo room of the WWE Performance Center, where Rhodes would teach promo classes, there is a puppet of Rhodes hanging on the equipment, symbolizing that he is still there, watching the students. In May 2020, the tag team FTR, created in WWE in 2014 and previously known as The Revival within the company until 2020, revealed that Rhodes was the one who created the team; According to the duo, Rhodes was not only highly influential in both the creation and development of the team, but had \\"unwavering faith\\" in them even as some of the other coaches had doubts, and was their \\"biggest supporter and pushed for [them] harder than anybody\\" until his passing. The two, who were both from North Carolina, acknowledged that their southern accents contributed to the lack of faith some coaches had for them at the Performance Center (with WWE president Vince McMahon's dislike for southern accents being well-known backstage).

J.\\" Ryan Jr. (born December 28, 1975) is an American baseball coach and former relief pitcher. He is currently the pitching coach for the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns baseball team, where he played for coach Tony Robichaux in 1997 and 1998. He also played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1999 to 2009. Amateur career Ryan attended Airline High School in Bossier City, Louisiana, where he played for the school's baseball team. After going unselected in the Major League Baseball (MLB) draft out of high school, Ryan enrolled at the Centenary College of Louisiana and played for the Gentlemen. He was a two-way player while at Centenary. Ryan threw three complete games as a true freshman for the Gentlemen. As a sophomore pitcher, Ryan threw seven complete games while racking up 100.2 innings pitched for the season. As a hitter, he had 209 at bats. When Ryan decided to transfer at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, head coach Tony Robichaux in the fall of 1996, the team used him as a relief pitcher, filling the role of their spot starter, in addition to playing outfield and first base. He quickly became one of UL Lafayette's best hitters, so the team moved Ryan into their starting first base position midway through the season. As a senior in 1998, he made 2 starts for the Ragin' Cajuns, pitching to a 6‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record with a 2.28 earned run average, while earning 6 saves. Additionally, he made 51 starts at first base, hitting at .370 batting average with 11 home runs and 36 RBIs. At the conclusion of the regular season, Ryan was named 2nd Team All-Sun Belt Conference. He was also named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1998 Sun Belt Conference Baseball Tournament. Professional career=Minor Leagues and Cincinnati Reds The Cincinnati Reds selected Ryan in the seventeenth round as a pitcher, with the 500th overall selection, of the 1998 MLB Draft. The Reds assigned Ryan to the Billings Mustangs of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, where he made fourteen appearances before he was promoted to the Charleston Alley Cats of the low-A South Atlantic League. He earned yet another promotion before the season ended to the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League finishing the year with a 2.06 ERA in 33 games with 10 saves. In 1999, he began the season with Chattanooga, but was promoted to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA International League. The Reds added Ryan to their 40-man roster on July 28, 1999, to use him in the bullpen. He made his major league debut that same day, logging 2 innings, walking 1 and giving up 4 hits. Baltimore Orioles On July 31, 1999, Ryan was traded to the Baltimore Orioles with Jacobo Sequea for Juan Guzm√°n and cash. Ryan started his career as a left-handed specialist. His inability to command his pitches, combined with a history of difficulty facing right-handed batters, prevented him from acquiring a larger role in the bullpen. However, his eccentric, three-quarter, slingshot-like delivery made him a dominant force against left-handed batters. On May 1, 2003, Ryan logged an unusual accomplishment: he won a game without throwing a pitch. Ryan's first throw was to first base where he picked off Detroit Tigers' Omar Infante to end the inning. The Orioles took the lead in the next half-inning and Ryan was relieved to begin the half-inning after that. During his prime, Ryan was able to not only control his pitches, but also add tailing movement to his low-90s fastball. This movement, combined with his devastating slider, helped his success rate against right-handed batters. During his years with Baltimore, he translated this success into a larger role in the Orioles' bullpen. By the middle of 2004, he secured the primary setup role. By the end of the year, he took Jorge Julio's job as the closer. In 2005, Ryan had a spectacular season as closer for Baltimore, converting 36 of 41 save opportunities and compiling a 2.43 ERA and appearing in the All-Star Game. Toronto Blue Jays Ryan became one of the most coveted free agents in Major League Baseball during the 2005 off-season. After considering an offer to rejoin the Orioles, as well as visiting with other potential suitors such as the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees, Ryan signed a 5-year, $47-million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on November 28, 2005. At the time, that was the largest contract for a reliever in Major League Baseball history, surpassing Mariano Rivera's 4-year, $40-million deal with the Yankees from 2001 to 2004. On July 3, 2006 it was announced that Ryan would make his second All-Star Game appearance when he was one of five Toronto Blue Jays players selected for the American League All- Star Team. During the 2006 All-Star Game held on July 10 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Ryan pitched the scoreless eighth inning and earned the win for the American League. He finished the year with a career-high 38 saves, ranking third in the league behind Francisco Rodriguez of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Bobby Jenks of the Chicago White Sox. On May 10, 2007, The Toronto Blue Jays announced that Ryan underwent Tommy John surgery in his left elbow and would be out for the remainder of the 2007 season. Ryan's place in the bullpen was taken by Jeremy Accardo and Casey Janssen, with Accardo making the league minimum salary. On the morning of April 13, 2008, less than one year removed from Tommy John surgery, B.J. Ryan was activated from the disabled list. Later that afternoon, he entered the game in the 10th inning, and picked up his first save in over one year. Despite his arm not being fully healed and his slider's reduced effectiveness, he still managed to save an impressive 32 games for the Jays, good enough to place 6th on the AL list of top saves by closers. He was also nominated for the DHL Delivery Man of the Year Award. From his return to around a month later, he had an average ERA under 1.00. Despite eight years of solid health, some have criticized Ryan's mechanics as making him significantly more susceptible to injury. Ryan got off to slow start to the 2009 season due to his significant drop in velocity, which limited his effectiveness. On April 23, Ryan was placed on the 15-day DL with problems in his throwing shoulder, more specifically a strained trapezius muscle. When he was activated from the DL, he was used as a middle reliever. The closing job went to Scott Downs. On July 8, 2009, Ryan was released by the Blue Jays. At the time of his release, the Blue Jays were still responsible for the roughly $5 million remaining on his contract for the remainder of 2009, as well as the $10 million he was owed for 2010.Sportsnet.ca Blue Jays general manager J.P. Ricciardi was widely criticized for the Ryan contract. Chicago Cubs On July 16, 2009, eight days after being released by the Blue Jays, the Chicago Cubs came to an agreement with Ryan. After working out at the Cubs' Arizona Spring Training facility, he was assigned to their AAA affiliate, the Iowa Cubs. He felt that his velocity would not get any higher, so he asked for his unconditional release, which was granted on August 5, 2009. Personal Ryan's entrance music was \\"Duality\\" by Slipknot. Coaching career On July 24, 2019, Ryan was named the pitching coach at Louisiana.

It is half grassland slopes and half developed plain at the foot of the South Downs National Park. Twentieth- century estates dovetail into those of slightly larger Lancing. Etymology The village's name comes from the Old English *sumpt + -ingas, meaning \\"(settlement of) the dwellers at the marsh\\". Its earliest recorded form is Suntinga, in a document of 956, but Domesday Book (1086) renders the name as Sultinges, its Norman-speaking clerks being unfamiliar with the consonant- cluster -mpt. As the toponymist Adrian Room noted, there is no obviously marshy land there nowadays, but it is low-lying and near the sea. Landmarks and major buildings The Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin is a Grade I-listed Anglo-Saxon and Norman church, separated from the centre of the village since 1939 by the busy A27 road. Its tower is topped with a \\"Rhenish helm\\"‚Äîa four-sided gabled pyramidal cap which is unique in England. The church was originally built by the Saxons c.960 AD, then was adapted by the Normans when William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber granted it to the Knights Templar in the 12th century. The church later passed to the Knights Hospitaller in the 15th century. The Sompting Abbotts building, designed by Philip Charles Hardwick and completed in 1856, is a preparatory school. (School web site) However this has been the site of one of Sompting's manor houses since Norman times, when it was owned by the abbot of F√©camp in Normandy, and later owned by the abbot of Syon Abbey in Middlesex. In 1248 the abbot of F√©camp had a prison in the village. Queen Caroline, consort of King George IV stayed at Sompting Abbotts in 1814 on her way across the English Channel to the Continent. The old Sompting Rectory building, now used as a nursing home, dates from 1791, however the Rectory has a long history, having previously been owned by the Knights Templar from 1154 and like Sompting Church, passed to the Knights Hospitaller in the 15th century. During the First World War a prisoner-of-war camp was built on the Rectory Farm estate, on the west side of Busticle Lane. Sompting's Parish Hall was originally built as a reading room in 1889 by HP Crofts of Sompting Abbotts manor: his Crofts/Tristram family have owned farmland and built property in the parish, known as the Sompting Estate, since 1748. As well as the church mentioned alternative Christian worship at the Methodist mission chapel, registered in 1887 formerly took place. Sompting Community Centre was originally built in 1872 as a Junior and Infants School. It was known as a place of innovative education due to the work of the headmistress Harriet Finlay-Johnson who used drama as the focus of the village children's education.The Dramatic Method of Teaching, The Spectator, 1911, Retrieved 30 January 2016 A house which belonged to Edward Trelawny, adventurer, author and friend of Percy Bysshe Shelley, is also in the village. The parish of Sompting includes the hamlet of Beggars Bush on the Downs as well as the former hamlets of Upper Cokeham and Lower Cokeham, which are now part of the Sompting-Lancing conurbation. Cokeham means Cocca's homestead (ham). Sompting also historically extended west to the ancient droveway today known as Charmandean Lane, but in 1933 this land was given to the neighbouring borough of Worthing. Sompting's eastern border with Lancing has historically been defined by the Boundstone Lane, so called because of the boundary stone or boundstone that lay on the boundary. The stone is now kept in Boundstone Nursery. On the northern edge a settlement existed at Park Brow on the Downs' crest in the Bronze Age through the Iron Age until Roman times. It lasted until its buildings were burned down c.270 AD, possibly by Saxon or Frankish pirates. It is supposed that the inhabitants moved from here to the relative safety of the hillfort at Cissbury Ring. Geography The highest point in the civil parish is Steep Down at above Ordnance Datum (sea level). In the western part of the parish of Sompting lies the Sompting Gap, a protected area that lies between Sompting and Worthing. This area was formerly an inlet of the sea and it is here that the Broadwater Brook (also known as Sompting Brook) flows into Brooklands Park and on into the sea. Some of the reedbeds in the Sompting Gap at Lower Cokeham have been designated a Site of Nature Conservation Importance. In literature The writer Alfred Longley lived in Sompting, creator of the character 'Jimmy Smuggles' and his Sompting Treacle Mines,Notes on Alfred Longley where \\"incredibly lazy people worked\\". Annual events Sompting is also known for its mummers play, performed by the Sompting Village Morris dancers. In 2005, a small group got together and started the Sompting Festival, which was held for the first time over the weekend 2‚Äì4 June 2006, as one of the launch events for the Adur festival. Since then this has developed into the annual Sompting Beer & Music Festival held on Sompting Recreation Ground, West Street, Sompting. It incorporates the Sompting Village Hall Open Weekend, and the Somptin' Old exhibition ‚Äì a fascinating history of Sompting in pictures set up by former Sompting Parish Councillor Mike Prince, which attracts interest from all over the world.

He has developed his views and positions across many fields including legal theory, philosophy and religion, social and political theory, progressive alternatives, and economics. In natural philosophy he is known for The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time. In social theory he is known for Politics: A Work in Constructive Social Theory. In legal theory he was part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools.Waldron, Jeremy. \\"Dirty Little Secret\\", Columbia Law Review 98, 1 March 1998. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015.Anderson, Perry, \\"Roberto Unger and the Politics of Empowerment\\", New Left Review 173 (February 1989). His work is seen to offer a vision of humanity and a program to empower individuals and change institutions.Smolin, Lee. \\"No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements\\", Times Higher Education Supplement, 31 August 2007.Neu, Jerome. \\"Looking All around for Our Real Selves\\", New York Times Book Review, 8 July 1984, p. 24 At the core of his philosophy is a view of humanity as greater than the contexts in which it is placed. He sees each individual possessed with the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the social world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural or necessary social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, wage labor‚Äîfor Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation. Unger has long been active in Brazilian opposition politics. He was one of the founding members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and drafted its manifesto.Simon, William H. \\"Social Theory and Political Practice: Unger's Brazilian Journalism\\", Northwestern University Law Review 81 (1986-87): p. 312. He directed the presidential campaigns of Leonel Brizola and Ciro Gomes, ran for the Chamber of Deputies, and twice launched exploratory bids for the Brazilian presidency. He served as the Minister of Strategic Affairs in the second Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva administration and in the second Dilma administration. Biography=Family Unger's maternal grandfather was Oct√°vio Mangabeira, who served as Brazil's minister of foreign affairs in the late 1920s before the dictatorship of Get√∫lio Vargas subjected him to a series of imprisonments and exiles in Europe and the United States. After returning to Brazil in 1945, he co-founded a center-left party. He was elected as a representative in the C√¢mara Federal in 1946, governor of Bahia in 1947, and Senator in 1958. Both of Unger's parents were intellectuals. His German-born father, Artur Unger, from Dresden, arrived in the United States as a child and later became a U.S. citizen. His mother, Edyla Mangabeira, was a Brazilian poet and journalist. Artur and Edyla met in the US during the exile of Oct√°vio Mangabeira. Early life Roberto Mangabeira Unger was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, and spent his childhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He attended the private Allen-Stevenson School. When he was eleven, his father died and his mother moved the family back to Brazil. He attended a Jesuit school and went on to law school at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Unger was admitted to Harvard Law School in September 1969. After receiving his LLM, Unger stayed at Harvard another year on a fellowship, and then entered the doctoral program. At 23 years old, Unger began teaching jurisprudence, among other things, to first year students. In 1976, aged 29, he got SJD and became one of the youngest faculty members to receive tenure from the Harvard Law School. Academic career The beginning of Unger's academic career began with the books Knowledge and Politics and Law in Modern Society, published in 1975 and 1976 respectively.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1975). Knowledge and Politics. New York: Free Press.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1976). Law In Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory. New York: Free Press. These works led to the co-founding of Critical Legal Studies (CLS) with Duncan Kennedy and Morton Horwitz. The movement stirred up controversy in legal schools across America as it challenged standard legal scholarship and made radical proposals for legal education. By the early 1980s, the CLS movement touched off a heated internal debate at Harvard, pitting the CLS scholars against the older, more traditional scholars. Throughout much of the 1980s, Unger worked on his magnum opus, Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory, a three volume work that assessed classical social theory and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series is based on the premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, Politics was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking the idea that there is a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. feudalism to capitalism, it then built an anti- necessitarian theory of social change, theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another. Unger devoted much of the following decades to further elaborating on the insights developed in Politics by working out the political and social alternatives. What Should Legal Analysis Become? (Verso, 1996) developed tools to reimagine the organization of social life. Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative (Verso, 1998) and What Should the Left Propose? (Verso, 2005) put forth alternative institutional proposals. Intellectual influences Unger's model of philosophical practice is closest to those philosophers who sought to form a view of the whole of reality, and to do so by using and resisting the specialized knowledge of their time.Robin W. Lovin and Michael J. Perry (eds.), Critique and Construction: A Symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). It has been read as a form of pragmatism, but also as an attempt to disengage ideas and experiences that developed in the West under the influence of Christianity from the categories of Greek philosophy.Lee Smolin, \\"No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements\\", Times Higher Education Supplement, 31 August 2007. His thought has been called the inverse of Schopenhauer's philosophy, affirming the supreme value of life and the reality and depth of the self and eschewing fecklessness.Boyle, James. \\"Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's \\"Passion\\", Harvard Law Review 98, no. 5 (1 March 1985): pp. 1066‚Äì83. Lecturing in Hauser Hall, Harvard Law School Philosophical work=Social theory Unger's social theory is premised on the idea of classical social theory that society is an artifact and can be created and recreated.Bernard Yack, \\"Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation,\\" Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1963. Whereas previous thinkers such as Hegel or Marx backslid at some point and held onto the notion that there was a necessary institutional or historical social development, Unger, in the words of one critic, seeks to \\"take the idea to the hilt and produce a theory of emancipation that will escape the limitations of liberal and Marxist theories.\\" That limitation is the search for an ideal structure of society that can be foreseen and centrally planned; whereas the emancipation leads to societies with greater institutional flexibility and variation.Bernard Yack, \\"Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation,\\" Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1964. For Unger, society emerges not through compromise or the winnowing down of best options, but rather through conflict and struggle for control of political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls formative context. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to believe and act as if their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They come to see the existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this false necessity. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls negative capability.Frank Blackler, \\"Formative Contexts and Activity System: Postmodern Approaches to the Management of China,\\" in Rethinking Organization: New Directions in Organization Theory and Analysis, ed. M. I. Reed and Michael Hughes (London ; Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1992), 273‚Äì94. This leads Unger to the conclusion that change happens piecemeal through struggle and vision, rather than suddenly in revolutionary upheaval with the replacement of one set of institutional arrangements with another. Unger theorizes that cumulative change can alter formative contexts, and he goes on to propose a number of such changes as institutional alternatives to be implemented, which he calls Empowered democracy. Empowered democracy is Unger's vision of a more open and more plastic set of social institutions through which individuals and groups can interact, propose change, and effectively empower themselves to transform social, economic, and political structures. Unger's strategy in its realization is to combine freedom of commerce and governance at the local level with the ability of political parties at the central government level to promote radical social experiments that would bring about decisive change in social and political institutions.Perry Anderson, \\"Roberto Unger and the Politics of Empowerment,\\" New Left Review 173 (February 1989). In practice, the theory would involve radical developments in politics at the center, as well as social innovation in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revising powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through rotating capital funds, which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens' rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal politics have failed to disrupt.Robin W. Lovin and Michael J. Perry, eds., Critique and Construction : A Symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). Unger's ideas developed in a context where young intellectuals and radicals attempted to reconcile the conventional theories of society and law being taught in university classrooms with the reality of social protest and revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Disillusioned with Marxism, they turned to thinkers like Levi-Strauss, Gramsci, Habermas, and Foucault in attempt to situate understandings of law and society as a benign science of technocratic policy within a broader system of beliefs that legitimized the prevailing social order. Unlike Habermas, however, who formulates procedures for attaining rational consensus, Unger locates resolution in institutions and their arrangements that remain perpetually open to revision and reconstruction. And, unlike Foucault, who also emphasizes the constructed character of social life, Unger takes this as an opportunity to reimagine institutions and social conditions that will unleash human creativity and enable liberation.William Connolly, \\"Making the Friendly World Behave,\\" The New York Times, February 7, 1988. Legal thought Unger's work on law has sought to denaturalize the concept of law and how it is represented through particular institutions. He begins by inquiring into why modern societies have legal systems with distinctions between institutions, such as legislature and court, as well as a special caste of lawyers possessing a method of reasoning about social problems. Whereas thinkers such as Marx and Weber had argued that such legal arrangements were a product of economic necessity to secure property rights and the autonomy of the individual, Unger shows that this liberal legal order emerged in Europe as a result of the indeterminate relations between monarchy, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie. It took the particular form that it did by emerging out of the long tradition of natural law and universality, rather than of necessity. This early work in historical analysis of law and legal thought laid the basis for Unger's contribution to the Critical Legal Studies movement. The movement itself was born in the late 1970s among young legal scholars at Harvard Law School who denounced the theoretical underpinnings of American jurisprudence, legal realism. The participants were committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality without the hidden interests and class domination of legal institutions. Two tendencies of the movement developed, one, a radical indeterminacy that criticized law as meaning anything we want it to mean, and the other, a neo-Marxist critique that attacked legal thought as an institutional form of capitalism. Unger offered a third tendency, a constructive vision of rethinking rights based on individual emancipation and empowerment, and structural arrangements that would lend themselves to constant revision with the goal of creating more educational and economic opportunities for more people. He laid this out in The Critical Legal Studies Movement, which quickly earned him a following as the philosophical mentor and prophet of the movement.Hutchinson, Allan C., and Patrick J. Monahan (1984). \\"The Rights Stuff: Roberto Unger and Beyond\\", Texas Law Review 62: pp. 1477‚Äì1539.Bartholomew, Amy, and Alan Hunt (1990). \\"What's Wrong with Rights\\", Law and Inequality: A Journal of Theory and Practice 9:1.Tamanaha, Brian Z. On the Rule of Law: History, Politics, Theory (Cambridge, UK; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 74. Economic thought At the center of Unger's thought about the economy is the commitment to reimagining and remaking the institutional arrangements of how humans produce and exchange. For Unger, economic institutions have no inherent or natural forms, and he rejects the necessitarian tendencies of classical and neo-classical economists, seeking instead alternatives to the arrangements of contemporary societies. In his writings, he has aimed to revise ideas on the importance of market economies and the division of labor in the workplace and national and global economies.Samuel Moyn, \\"The Politics of Economy,\\" Ethics & International Affairs 16, no. 2 (2002): 135-142. =Critique of economics= Unger's critique of economics begins with the identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger's analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1987), Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task, New York: Verso, pp. 120‚Äì128. Unger's critique of Marginalism begins with Walras' equilibrium theory, which attempted to achieve a certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations. The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate empirical evidence and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose anything more than a policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes' solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation. =Reorientating economics= Unger's vision of economics is that it cannot be unhinged from ideas about the individual and social life. Human activity and political organization must be incorporated into any analysis of trade and economies. In remaking the discipline, he calls for a return to the normative practice of classical economics but stripped of its necessitarian assumptions and typological references. The development of explanatory claims and prescriptive ideas are necessary. The discipline must connect the transformation of nature with that of society‚Äîthe making of things with the reorganization of people.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics, Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 2-8, 214-22. In Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics, he sets forth six ideas to begin thinking about economic activity.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics, Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 77-94. #The problem of specialization and discovery. Competition comes to inhibit self transformation when trading partners are unequal but not radically unequal, for both are forced into cost cutting rather than innovating and increasing efficiency. #The problem of politics over economics. The making and implementation of policy is not one of discovery, but rather of top down implementation. Rigid state control will limit how a society can respond to tensions and crisis, and thus politics creates its own presuppositions and limits creativity and alternative solutions. #Free trade should strengthen the capacity for self transformation by organizing the trading regime in a way that strengthens the capacity of trading partners to experiment and innovate. It becomes question not of how much free trade, but what kind. The best arrangements are those that impose the least amount of restraint. #Alternative free trade. The market has no necessary and natural form. If the market economy can be organized in a different way then so can a universal order of free trade among market economies. #The division of labor remade. The pin factory organization of labor describes the organization of work as if labor were a machine. But we can make machines to do this work. We should then innovate in those areas where we don't yet know how to make the machine to do the work. Production should be one of collective learning and permanent innovation. #Mind against context. The mind is both a machine and an anti- machine; it is both formulaic and totalizing. Thus we never rest in any context, and we need to have arrangements that constantly lend themselves to reinvention. =Reconstructing economic institutions= For Unger, the economy is not only a device for wealth but also permanent innovation and discovery. It should allow the greatest freedom of the recombination of people and resources, and allow people to innovate in institutional settings. The market economy should not be single dogmatic version of itself.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. \\"Political economy after the crisis\\": lecture 3, harvard.edu, 8 February 2012. Unger has presented a number of general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where the idea is to support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when it may be necessary to restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics, Princeton: Princeton University Press, Chapter 5. =On the twenty-first- century economic stimulus= Most recently, in a YouTube video titled he laid out three key policies to address the current economy: #Change the arrangements of finance in relation to production so that finance is in the service of production. Tax and regulate to discourage finance that does not contribute to production. Use public capital for venture capital funds. #Broaden economic opportunity by supporting small and medium enterprise. Reject the choice between government regulation and state controlled models. Support cooperation between government and firms, and cooperation and competition among firms. #Education. A system of schools to meet needs of a vibrant and flexible economy. Vocational schools that teach general concepts and flexibility, not job-specific skills. =\\"Illusions of necessity in the economic order\\"= Unger's first writing on economic theory was the article \\"Illusions of necessity in the economic order\\" in the May 1978 issue of American Economic Review. In the article he makes a case for the need of contemporary economic thought to imitate classical political economy in which theories of exchange should be incorporated into theories of power and perception.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. \\"Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order\\", American Economic Review (May 1978): pp. 369-73. The article articulates the problem of the American economy as one of the inability to realize democracy of production and community in the workplace. This failure, according to Unger, is the result of the lack of a comprehensive program that encompasses production, society, and state, so that immediate attempts to address inequality get swallowed up and appropriated by the status quo in the course of winning immediate gains for the organization or constituency, e.g. unions. To realize a democracy in the workplace and the abolition of wealth and poverty, Unger argues for the need to relate the program of worker community and democracy with an enlargement of democracy at the national level‚Äîthe goal cannot be only one of economic production and worker's rights, but must be accompanied by a national project at the structural level. He pushes this idea further by calling not just for a restructuring of the relationship between the firm and state based on private property, but that it also has to be replaced with a new set of rights encompassing access to jobs, markets, and capital. Only as private rights are phased out can rights of decentralized decision making and market exchange be extended to workers. This needs to be accompanied by limits on the size of enterprise and how profits are used to control others' labor. Neoclassical economics is not up to this task because it begins with preconceived standards that it applies to explain empirical data, while leaving out that which is a theoretical anomaly; there is no causal basis of analysis, Unger says, rather everything is embedded in a timeless universal without any account for context. Furthermore, the ambiguity of concepts of maximization, efficiency, and rationalization pin the analysis to a certain notion of the behavior of the rationalizing individual, making the analysis either tautological or reduced to a set of power relations translated into the language of material exchange. Programmatic thought Key in Unger's thinking is the need to re-imagine social institutions before attempting to revise them. This calls for a program, or programmatic thought. In building this program, however, we must not entertain complete revolutionary overhaul, lest we be plagued by three false assumptions: *Typological fallacy: the fallacy that there is closed list of institutional alternatives in history, such as \\"feudalism\\" or \\"capitalism\\". There is not a natural form of society, only the specific result of the piecemeal institutional changes, political movements, and cultural reforms (as well as the accidents and coincidences of history) that came before it. *Indivisibility fallacy: most subscribers to revolutionary Leftism wrongly believe that institutional structures must stand and fall together. However, structures can be reformed piecemeal. *Determinism fallacy: the fallacy that uncontrollable and little understood law-like forces drive the historical succession of institutional systems. However, there is no natural flow of history. We make ourselves and our world, and can do so in any way we choose. To think about social transformation programmatically, one must first mark the direction one wants society to move in, and then identify the first steps with which we can move in that direction. In this way we can formulate proposals at points along the trajectory, be they relatively close to how things are now or relatively far away. This provides a third way between revolution and reform. It is revolutionary reform, where one has a revolutionary vision, but acts on that vision in a sequence of piecemeal reforms. As Unger puts it, transformative politics is \\"not about blueprints; it is about pathways. It is not architecture; it is music\\". =The two Lefts= Unger sees two main Lefts in the world today, a recalcitrant Left and a humanizing Left. The recalcitrant Left seeks to slow down the march of markets and globalization, and to return to a time of greater government involvement and stronger social programs. The humanizing Left (or 'reformist Left') accepts the world in its present form, taking the market economy and globalization as unavoidable, and attempts to humanize their effects through tax-and-transfer policies. Unger finds the two major orientations of contemporary Leftism inadequate and calls for a 'Reconstructive Left' ‚Äì one which would insist on redirecting the course of globalization by reorganizing the market economy. In his two books The Left Alternative and The Future of American Progressivism, Unger lays out a program to democratize the market economy and deepen democracy. This Reconstructive Left would look beyond debates on the appropriate size of government, and instead re-envision the relationship between government and firms in the market economy by experimenting with the coexistence of different regimes of private and social property. It would be committed to social solidarity, but \\"would refuse to allow our moral interests in social cohesion [to] rest solely upon money transfers commanded by the state in the form of compensatory and retrospective redistribution\\", as is the case with federal entitlement programs. Instead, Unger's Reconstructive Left affirms \\"the principle that everyone should share, in some way and at some time, responsibility for taking care of other people.\\" =The Left Alternative program= Unger has laid out concrete policy proposals in areas of economic development, education, civil society, and political democracy.These policy points are taken from Unger, The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2007), and Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, . September 2011. * On economic development, Unger has noted that there are only two models for a national economy available to us today: the US model of business control of government, and the northeast Asian model of top down bureaucratic control of the economy. Citing the need for greater imagination on the issue, he has offered a third model that is decentralized, pluralistic, participatory, and experimental. This would take the form of an economy encouraging small business development and innovation that would create large scale self-employment and cooperation. The emphasis is not on the protection of big business as the main sectors of the economy, but the highly mobile and innovative small firm. * Unger links the development of such an economy to an education system that encourages creativity and empowers the mind, not one that he now sees geared for a reproduction of the family and to put the individual in service of the state. He proposes that such a system should be run locally but have standards enforced through national oversight, as well as a procedure in place to intervene in the case of the failing of local systems. * Unger's critique of and alternative to social programs goes to the heart of civil society. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy. * Unger's proposal for political democracy calls for a high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of the party in power to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action. Theoretical philosophy At the core of Unger's theoretical philosophy are two key conceptions: first the infinity of the individual, and secondly the singularity of the world and the reality of time. The premise behind the infinity of the individual is that we exist within social contexts but we are more than the roles that these contexts may define for us‚Äîwe can overcome them. In Unger's terms, we are both \\"context-bound and context-transcending; \\"we appear as \\"the embodied spirit;\\" as \\"the infinite imprisoned within the finite.\\"David M. Trubek, \\"Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought,\\" American Journal of Sociology 95, no. 2 (1989): 448. For Unger, there is no natural state of the individual and his social being. Rather, we are infinite in spirit and unbound in what we can become. As such, no social institution or convention can contain us. While institutions do exist and shape our beings and our interactions, we can change both their structure and the extent to which they imprison us. The philosophy of the singularity of the world and the reality of time establishes history as the site of decisive action through the propositions that there is only one real world, not multiple or simultaneous universes, and that time really exists in the world, not as a simulacrum through which we must experience the world.Lee Smolin, \\"No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements,\\" Times Higher Education Supplement, August 31, 2007. These two concepts of infinity and reality lie at the heart of Unger's program calling for metaphysical and institutional revolutions. From the concept of the self as infinite but constrained, Unger argues that we must continually transform our environment to better express ourselves. This can only be done in a singular world within which time is real. =The self and human nature= In Passion: An Essay on Personality, Unger explores the individual and his relation to society from the perspective of the root human predicament of the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context. Unger's aim is to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society.Jerome Neu, \\"Looking All around for Our Real Selves,\\" New York Times Book Review, July 8, 1984. =Religion and the human condition= Unger has written and spoken extensively on religion and the human condition. Religion, Unger argues, is a vision of the world within which we anchor our orientation to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness. Unger sees four flaws in the human condition. They are, our mortality and the facing of imminent death; our groundlessness in that we are unable to grasp the solution to the enigma of existence, see the beginning or end of time, nor put off the discovery of the meaning of life; our insatiability in that we always want more, and demand the infinite from the finite; and our susceptibility to belittlement which places us in a position to constantly confront petty routine forcing us to die many little deaths. There are three major responses in the history of human thought to these flaws: escape, humanization, and confrontation. * The overcoming of the world denies the phenomenal world and its distinctions, including the individual. It proclaims a benevolence towards others and an indifference to suffering and change. One achieves serenity by becoming invulnerable to suffering and change. The religion of Buddhism and philosophical thought of Plato and Schopenhauer best represent this orientation. * The humanization of the world creates meaning out of social interactions in a meaningless world by placing all emphasis on our reciprocal responsibility to one another. Confucianism and contemporary liberalism represent this strand of thought, both of which aim to soften the cruelties of the world. * The struggle with the world is framed by the idea that series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation. =The religion of the future= The spiritual orientation of the struggle with the world has given rise to the secular movements of emancipation in the modern world, and it is here that Unger sees the religion of the future. The problem Unger sees, however, is that as an established religion, this orientation has betrayed its ideological underpinnings and has made peace with existing order. It has accepted the hierarchies of class structure in society, accepted the transfer of money as serving as the basis of solidarity, and reaffirmed the basis of existing political, economic, and social institutions by investing in a conservative position of their preservation. Thus, \\"to be faithful to what made this orientation persuasive and powerful in the first place, we must radicalize it against both established institutions and dominant beliefs.\\" Unger's call is for a revolution in our religious beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change in the life of the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we live our lives, and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow not a one time event but a continuing process. This is the program of empowered democracy that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. \\"The goal is not to humanize society but to divinize humanity.\\" It is \\"to raise ordinary life to a higher level of intensity and capability.\\" Natural philosophy Unger's philosophy of space and time presented in The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time argues for the singularity of the world and the reality of time. His arguments are grounded in the tradition of natural philosophy. He takes on the Newtonian idea of the independent observer standing outside of time and space, addresses the skepticism of David Hume, rejects the position of Kant, and attacks speculations about parallel universes of contemporary cosmology. At stake is the laying of the foundations for a view of the world and causality that is open to all possibilities; that is not a closed system of options in which our future is governed by deterministic laws and typologies. It is an understanding of society that rejects the naturalness and necessity of current social arrangements; \\"a form of understanding of society and history that refuses to explain the present arrangements in a manner that vindicates their naturalness and necessity.\\" The thesis of the singularity of the world states that there is one real world. Such a thesis stands in stark contrast to contemporary theoretical physics and cosmology, which speculate about multiple universes out of the dilemma of how to have law like explanations if the universe is unique‚Äîlaws will be universal because they don't just apply to this unique universe but to all universes. However, there is no empirical evidence for multiple worlds. Unger's singularity thesis can better address our empirical observations and set the conceptual platform to address the four main puzzles in cosmology today: Big Bang, initial conditions, horizon problem, and the precise value of constants, such as gravity, speed of light, and Planck's constant. The thesis that time is real states that time \\"really is real\\" and everything is subject to history. This move is to historicize everything, even the laws of nature, and to challenge our acting as if time were real but not too real‚Äîwe act as if it is somewhat real otherwise there would be no causal relations, but not so real that laws change. Unger holds that time is so real that laws of nature are also subject to its force and they too must change. There are no eternal laws upon which change occurs, rather time precedes structure. This position gives the universe a history and makes time non-emergent, global, irreversible, and continuous. Bringing these two thesis together, Unger theorizes that laws of nature develop together with the phenomenon they explain. Laws and initial conditions co-evolve, in the same that they do in how cells reproduce and mutate in different levels of complexity of organisms. In cosmological terms Unger explains the passing from one structure to another at the origins of the universe when the state of energy was high but not infinite, and the freedom of movement was greater than when operating under a known set of laws. The conditions of the early universe is compatible with the universe that preceded it. The new universe may be different in structure, but has been made with what existed in the old one, e.g. masses of elementary particles, strength of different forces, and cosmological constants. As the universe cools the phenomena and laws work together with materials produced by sequence; they are path dependent materials. They are also constrained by the family of resemblances of the effective laws against the background of the conceptions of alternative states the universe and succession of universes. =Mathematics and the one real, time-drenched world= One consequence of these positions that Unger points to is the revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If there is only one world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, but it is not a part of the world. Political engagement Roberto Mangabeira Unger speaking in Brazil in 2007 as the Minister of Strategic Affairs Unger has a long history of political activity in Brazil. He worked in early opposition parties in the 1970s/80s against the Brazilian military dictatorship, and drafted the founding manifesto for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) in 1980. He served as an intimate adviser to two presidential candidates, and launched exploratory bids himself in 2000 and 2006. He was the Secretary for Strategic Affairs in the Lula administration from 2007‚Äì09, and is currently working on a number of social and developmental projects in the state of Rond√¥nia. Driving Unger's political engagement is the idea that society can be made and remade. Unlike Mill or Marx, who posited a particular class as the agent of history, Unger does not see a single vehicle for transformative politics. He advocates world-wide revolution, but does not see this happening as a single cataclysmic event or undertaken by a class agent, like the Communist movement. Rather, he sees the possibility of piecemeal change, where institutions can be replaced one at a time, and permanent plasticity can be built into the institutional infrastructure. Early political activity, 1970s and 1980s Unger's engagement in Brazilian politics began in the late 1970s as Brazil started to democratize. In 1979, he presented himself to the main opposition party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), and was appointed chief of staff by party leader Ulysses Guimaraes. His initial work was to develop the positions of the party and draft policy proposals for their party's congressional representatives. When the military regime dissolved the two-party system and established a multi-party system later that year, Unger worked to unite progressive liberals and the independent, non-communist left into the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). As a co-founder of the party, he authored its first manifesto. Unger left the party after the rise of a conservative faction, which was a part of the MDB but had been excluded from the initial formation of the PMDB. After departing the PMDB in the early 1980s, Unger began looking for political agents who would serve as vehicles for his national alternative. In 1981, he jointed the Democratic Labour Party of Brazil (PDT) led by Leonel Brizola, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro and a figure of the left prior to the dictatorship. Brizola had founded the PDT and Unger saw it as the authentic opposition to the military regime. Throughout the 1980s he worked with Brizola to travel the country recruiting members, and developing policy positions and a political language. In 1983, Brizola, then serving his second of three terms as governor of Rio de Janeiro, appointed Unger to head the State Foundation for the Education of Minors (FEEM), a state-run foundation for homeless children. During his year-long tenure, he began a process of radical reforms of the institutions, such as opening the door to international adoption and reintegrating children with their families. He also set up community organizations in the slums to help support families in order to prevent the abandonment of children. Political campaigns, 1990s and 2000s In 1990, Unger ran a symbolic campaign for a seat in the national chamber of deputies. He had no money, no structure, and only campaigned for eight weeks. He ran on a platform of reforming the slums, and went around the slum neighborhoods giving lectures. He received 9,000 votes, just 1,000 votes short of winning the seat. None of the votes came from the slums, however. All his votes had come from the middle class, although he had never campaigned in those neighborhoods or to that constituency. Recalling the experience, Unger says \\"it was kind of absurd... I had no money, no staff, and I would go into these slums, alone, to hand out pamphlets, often to the local drug pushers.\\" It is an experience that Unger cites as leading to his belief that the system and possibilities were much more open than he had previously imagined. Unger served as Brizola's campaign organizer and primary political adviser in his bids for the Brazilian Presidency in 1989 and 1994. In 1989, Brizola finished in third place, losing the second position, which would have qualified him for a runoff against Fernando Collor de Mello, by a very narrow margin to Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. Brizola and Unger both supported Lula in the second round of the election, but Collor would go on to beat Lula and win the Presidency. Unger also helped organize the presidential bids of former finance minister and governor of Cear√°, Ciro Gomes, in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, Gomes came in third place with 11% of the vote, and in 2002 he came in fourth place with 12% of the vote. Unger had written The Next Step: An Alternative to Neoliberalism with Gomes in 1996. At the national level in 2002, again in the second round of the election, Unger supported Lula who went on to defeat Jos√© Serra to win the Presidency. With the experience of supporting others who imploded politically, Unger discovered that, as he put it, he was committing \\"the classic mistake of the philosophers in politics, which is to try to find someone else to do the work.\\" In 2000, he ran in the primaries for the mayor of Sao Paulo, but the PPS party leader suspended the primaries when it became clear that Unger would win the nomination and challenge party control. He launched an exploratory bid for the 2006 presidential election on the PRB ticket, but the party decided not to put forth its own candidate for the presidency and to support Lula of the PT. As Minister of Strategic Affairs in the Lula administration Minister Unger speaking to President Lula in 2007. Unger found President Lula's first term to be conservative and riddled with scandal. He wrote articles calling Lula's administration \\"the most corrupt of Brazil's history\\" and called for his impeachment.Marra, Ana Paula. Mangabeira Unger assume secretaria e diz que Lula foi magn√¢nimo ao convid√°-lo para o cargo, Ag√™ncia Brasil, 19 June 2007; retrieved 8 September 2007. Despite the criticism, many advisers to Lula insisted that he should invite Unger to join his administration. In June 2007, after winning his second term, Lula appointed Unger as head of the newly established Long-term Planning Secretariat (a post which would eventually be called The Minister of Strategic Affairs). Unger's work in office was an attempt to enact his program. Seeing the future in small enterprises and advocating a rotating capital fund that would function like a government run venture capital fund, he pushed for a rapid expansion of credit to smaller producers and a decentralized network of technical support centers that would help broaden the middle class from below. He further called for political solutions that would broaden access to production forces such as information technology, and for states to focus on equipping and monitoring civil society rather than trying to provide social services. Unger's specific projects while in office were focused on giving \\"ordinary men and women the instruments with which to render this vitality fertile and productive.\\" He aimed to use state powers and resources to allow the majority of poor workers to \\"follow the path of the emergent vanguard\\". He developed a series of sectoral and regional initiatives that would prefigure the model of development based on the broadening of economic and educational opportunity by democratizing the market economy and restructuring civil society. Unger receiving a medal of honor on Army Day 2008 from President Lula for his work in formulating Brazil's National Defense Strategy. Sectorally, Unger revamped the educational structure and rewrote labor laws. In education, he implemented a model of secondary education, where analytical problem-solving education was paired with technical education that focused on conceptual capabilities rather than job-specific skills. There are several hundred of these institutions today. He further drafted legislation to associate national, state and local jurisdictions into common bodies that could intervene when a local school system fell below the minimum acceptable threshold of quality and \\"fix it the way an independent administrator would fix a failing business under Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\\" In labor, Unger worked with unions to write new labor laws designed to protect and organize temporary workers, subcontractors, and those working in the informal economy. Regionally, some of Unger's most influential work was the implementation of a developmental strategy for the Amazon that would be sustainable environmentally by making it socially inclusive. He drafted and passed legislation to regularize small-scale squatters on untitled land by giving them clear legal titles, which would create self-interest in preservation while granting them economic opportunity. Included in this law were protections against large scale land grabbers. Such legislation aimed to empower locals living on Amazonian land by giving them ownership rights and linking their interest in preserving it, rather than pillaging it as quickly as possible in the face of ambiguous ownership rights. This legislation passed and was put into law. Unger touring the Amazon via small aircraft Unger served in the administration for two years. On 26 June 2009, President Lula announced Unger would be leaving the government and returning to Harvard University. He later cited personal and political reasons for his early departure.Szabla, Chris. \\"After Rocky but Influential Tenure, Brazil's \\"'Minister of Ideas' Returns to HLS\\", Harvard Law Record, 4 October 2009; accessed 13 December 2015. Engagement outside Brazil Unger's attempts to develop global social, political, and economic alternatives have led him in episodic engagements in national debates around the world.For example: see Unger and Zhiyuan Cui. 1994. \\"China in the Russian Mirror\\", New Left Review 208 (December 1994); Unger, 2009. The Left Alternative. London: Verso, pp. 171-88; Unger, 2009. \\"Espa√±a y su futuro ¬øun pa√≠s en transformaci√≥n?\\", Ediciones Sequitur; accessed 13 December 2015. His approach in these engagements recognizes that the problems facing contemporary societies are not distinct from nation to nation, and that general structural arrangements can first be implemented, which will allow for local innovation, flexibility, and development in social, economic, and political arenas. There is no institutional blueprint for Unger, however, only a direction that can be pointed to and general proposals that can be implemented to allow further institutional innovation and experimentation. Unger's guiding principle is that institutional flexibility needs to be built into the implemented system, and in this way a diversity of local experiments would take hold the world over. One of Unger's more promising engagements was the Latin American Alternative in the late 1990s. Unger and Mexican politician and political scientist Jorge Casta√±eda Gutman assembled an informal network of politicians and business leaders dedicated to redrawing the political map. The aim of the group was to provide a critique of neoliberalism coupled with a way forward in a distinct strategy and institutional model of development. They floated proposals such as guaranteeing every citizen \\"social rights\\" (e.g. education and a job), breaking up media oligopolies, and holding town meetings to help citizens supervise municipal spending. The group held a number of meetings over the years, which included Brazilian finance minister Ciro Gomes, Chilean senator Carlos Ominami, Argentinian politicians Dante Caputo and Rodolfo Terragno, and Mexican politician and future president Vicente Fox.Castaneda, Jorge. \\"Mexico: Permuting Power\\", New Left Review 7 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2001); accessed 13 December 2015. The meetings resulted in a document entitled the \\"Buenos Aires Consensus\\" in 1997,\\"A Latin American Alternative\\" document signed at Buenos Aires in November 1997; accessed 11 December 2015. which Castaneda called \\"the end of neoliberalism; of the Washington Consensus\\". This consensus was formally signed in 2003 by Argentinian President N√©stor Kirchner and Brazilian President Lula da Silva.Massaldi, Julian, \\"Buenos Aires Consensus: Lula and Kirchner's agreement 'Against Neoliberalism'\\" , zcommunications.org, 20 November 2003. Other Latin American leaders who signed it included Fox, future president of Chile Ricardo Lagos, Mexican politician Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas, former vice president of Nicaragua Sergio Ram√≠rez, future president of Argentina Fernando de la R√∫a, and former Brazilian president Itamar Franco. During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Unger was in frequent contact with candidate Barack Obama via email and Blackberry. He has since become critical of the Obama administration, and called for the defeat of Obama in the 2012 election as a first step to remaking the Democratic party. Current engagement Unger's recent political work has focused on the north-western Brazilian state of Rond√¥nia. He sees the human and natural resources of the state meeting all the conditions to serve as the vanguard of a new model of development for Brazil. Speaking to News Rond√¥nia he said, \\"Rond√¥nia is a state formed by a multitude of small and medium entrepreneurs together with the Brazilian government, and that is something truly unique in our country.\\" He has been traveling the state giving public lectures and encouraging political discourse and engagement in localities. Working with governor Jo√£o Aparecido Cahulla on development projects, Unger has outlined a series of important areas of focus. The first is to change the agricultural model from one of intensive farming to an industrialization of produces through the recuperation of degraded pastures, supply fertilizers and lime, and diversifying crops and livestock farming. The second key project is transforming education from rote learning to creative thinking and engagement. He helped open the School Teixeira in Porto Velho. Another ongoing project is the construction of a new educational center in accordance with his theory of pedagogical reform, where delinquents would be reintegrated into municipal life. Circumstance and influence Unger's philosophical work grapples with some of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence. It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law, and said to have provided one answer to Hume's Guillotine. Unger's analysis of liberalism and the philosophical program he builds around rethinking the individual has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry. In 1987, the Northwestern University Law Review devoted an issue to Unger's work, analysing his three volume publication Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory. Michael J. Perry, a professor of law at Northwestern University, praises Unger for producing a vast work of social theory that combines law, history, politics, and philosophy within a single narrative. Early reviewers of Politics questioned Unger's seeming predicament of criticizing a system of thought and its historical tradition without subjecting himself to the same critical gaze. \\"There is little acknowledgement that he himself is writing in a particular socio-historical context\\", wrote one reviewer,Hutchinson, Allan C. \\"Review: A Poetic Champion Composes: Unger (Not) on Ecology and Women\\", The University of Toronto Law Journal 40, no. 2 (1 April 1990): p. 279. and another asked, \\"in what context Unger himself is situated and why that context itself is not offered up to the sledgehammer.\\"Wilder, Joseph C. \\"Review\\", The American Political Science Review 83, no. 2 (1 June 1989): p. 623.See also Yack, Bernard. \\"Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation\\", Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (1 June 1988) Critics also balked at the lack of example or concrete vision of his social and political proposals.Yack, Bernard. \\"Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation\\", Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (1 June 1988): 1969. As one critic wrote, \\"it is difficult to imagine what Unger's argument would mean in practice\\", and that \\"he does not tell us what to make.\\"Shapiro, Ian. \\"Review: Constructing Politics\\", Political Theory 17, no. 3 (1989): pp. 481-82. Others have suggested that the lack of imagination of such readers is precisely what is at stake.Rorty, Richard. \\"Unger, Castoriadis, and the Romance of a National Future\\", Northwestern University Law Review 82 (1988-87).

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842, and served in numerous conflicts, including the Second Seminole War and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. During the Civil War, he was appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, and continued in that role through the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, and the Battle of Chancellorsville. Sykes assumed command of the V Corps on June 28, 1863, following the promotion of Major General George G. Meade to command of the entire army. Sykes's Corps fought with distinction on the second day of the subsequent Battle of Gettysburg on July 2. He was criticized for his performance in the Battle of Mine Run later that year, was removed from command on March 23, 1864, and sent to duty in Kansas. Sykes remained in the army after the war and died in 1880. Early life Sykes was born in Dover, Delaware. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842 and graduated 39th out of 56 cadets.What About George. . .? [Sykes, That Is] 48th Pennsylvania Infantry. 11 August 2007. Web. Retrieved March 12, 2016. It was during his time as cadet that he acquired the nicknames \\"Tardy George\\" and \\"Slow Trot\\" Sykes. He was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry. He served in the Second Seminole War, Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and numerous other conflicts. Sykes was brevetted as a captain for actions at the Battle of Cerro Gordo. By virtue of his service in the Mexican War, Sykes became a member of the Aztec Club of 1847. Sykes continued his frontier service and Indian fighting, mainly in New Mexico, and was promoted to full captain in 1855. His final peacetime station was Fort Clark, Texas. Civil War General Sykes and his staff At the outbreak of the Civil War, Sykes was assigned as a major in the new 14th U.S. Infantry. At the First Battle of Bull Run he commanded the Regular Infantry Battalion, a collection of eight regular army companies from different regiments, the only regulars on the field. Sykes got command of a brigade of regulars after Bull Run, and was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on September 28. He led his regulars in the Peninsula Campaign and rose to division command in May 1862 in the newly created V Corps. His men, who often referred to themselves as \\"Sykes' Regulars\\", distinguished themselves defending their position at Gaines' Mill during the Seven Days Battles, before the Union line broke elsewhere.Tagg, p. 82. Sykes was notably the only division commander in the Army of the Potomac not rewarded with a promotion to major general after the Seven Days Battles. He continued leading his division at Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg, although it was not heavily engaged in the latter two battles.The division had two regular brigades and one of volunteer infantry. Gouverneur K. Warren commanded that brigade for a time. At Chancellorsville, his regulars led the advance into the Confederate rear at the start of the battle. Sykes' division engaged Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws' division on the Orange Turnpike. Sykes' division was forced to retreat after being attacked on the right flank by Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes' division, then the army commander, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, nervously recalled his advance to a defensive position; and Sykes' men were not engaged for the remainder of the campaign. Sykes finally received a promotion to major general of volunteers on November 29, 1862. None of these battles demonstrated any aggressive or unique offensive capabilities on his part. When corps commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade was promoted to lead the Army of the Potomac on June 28, 1863, Sykes assumed command of the V Corps. Commanders of the Army of the Potomac: Gouverneur K. Warren, William H. French, George G. Meade, Henry J. Hunt, Andrew A. Humphreys and George Sykes in September 1863 At the Battle of Gettysburg, Sykes' corps fought in support of the beleaguered III Corps on the Union left flank. In his 1st Division (Brig. Gen. James Barnes), the fabled defense of Little Round Top was led by brigade commander Col. Strong Vincent and the 20th Maine Infantry under Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His 3rd Division, the Pennsylvania Reserves, led by Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford, attacked from Little Round Top, drove the Confederates across the \\"Valley of Death\\" and ended the deadly fighting in the Wheatfield. But there is little in the historical record that highlights any personal contribution made by Sykes. On October 16, 1863, Sykes was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular army. In the Battle of Mine Run in the fall of 1863, Meade complained of Sykes' uninspiring performance. Meade and general-in-chief Ulysses S. Grant agreed that Sykes was not a good choice for the upcoming Overland Campaign in May 1864, so when the Army of the Potomac was reorganized that spring, Sykes was removed from command of the V Corps and sent to uneventful duty in the Department of Kansas. During Price's Raid in 1864, he was replaced with James G. Blunt. Postbellum career After the war, Sykes was mustered out of the volunteer service and returned to serve in the regular army in 1866. As Lieutenant Colonel, he served in the 5th U.S. Infantry. Sykes was promoted to colonel on January 12, 1868 and received command of the 20th U.S. Infantry. He commanded at a number of duty stations from Minnesota to Texas until he died while on duty in Texas at Fort Brown on February 8, 1880, at age 57. He was interred in West Point Cemetery, West Point, New York. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Union) NotesReferences * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands.

The base officially closed 15 November 2006. The base's property, on Singing River Island in the Mississippi Sound at the mouth of the Pascagoula River, was formally transferred to the Mississippi Secretary of State's office 9 July 2007.  History  Singing River Island (437-acre (1.8-km¬≤)) is man-made, having been created over the years as dredge materials from the Pascagoula federal channel and nearby Ingalls Shipbuilding shipyard was deposited in the area. In the early 1980s, the United States Congress approved the strategic homeporting initiative to build additional bases and disperse the Fleet from the main concentration areas. The story of Naval Station Pascagoula began in 1985 when the Secretary of the Navy John Lehman selected the Singing River Island location as one of the new Strategic Homeport sites. Base construction began in 1988, and the station became an operational homeport of Perry-class guided-missile frigates in 1992 with the arrival of the first ship, . The Naval Station's support mission increased dramatically in subsequent years due to a variety of actions: the Base Realignment and Closure Commission 1993 recommendations, which meant ships and other units moved to Pascagoula from other bases; the reorganization of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic, which homeported Ticonderoga class cruisers in Pascagoula. As part of this reorganization shifted homeports to Pascagoula in September 1996. The Coast Guard also relocated Coast Guard Station Pascagoula and a Reliance-class (210') Coast Guard cutter to the naval station. In April 1994, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 6 (COMDESRON 6) changed homeport to Pascagoula, Mississippi and subsequently was dual-hatted as Commander, Naval Surface Group Pascagoula. In January 1996, as a result of a reorganization of the United States Atlantic Fleet, Commander, Naval Surface Group Pascagoula was renamed Commander, Regional Support Group Pascagoula. In April 1998, as the result of yet another reorganization, COMDESRON 6 shifted operational control to Commander, Western Hemisphere Group, and was redesignated as a Tactical Squadron. Around 1998, the squadron included Hall, Ticonderoga, and Yorktown. In December 1999, COMDESRON 6 was redesignated as a Tactical/Readiness Squadron under the operational control of Commander, Naval Surface Group 2. At one point, the composition of Destroyer Squadron 6 included FFG-16 at Mayport, FFG 22 at Charleston, SC, at Charleston, SC, FFG 15 at Norfolk, and FFG 20 and FFG 21 at Pascagoula. NS Pascagoula logo The Naval Station provided support not only to personnel stationed on board the station and its homeported ships but also to pre-commissioning crews of surface combatant ships that were being constructed at Ingalls Shipbuilding. Beginning in Fiscal Year 1999, the station assumed ownership and operating responsibility for the Lakeside Naval Support Facility (Lakeside NSF). The Lakeside NSF, located within the city of Pascagoula approximately 10 miles from the main base, provides berthing primarily for the pre-commissioning crews. The base also provided support to the Navy community at large in a variety of ways, most notably through the Fleet and Family Support Center, the Housing Referral Office, and the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Department. As of 2005, NAVSTA Pascagoula supported approximately 2,000 active duty military, including those assigned to ships and tenant commands on the station. It employed more than 200 civilian workers; supported 4,100 family members of active duty military; approximately 850 reservists who live in Jackson County; and approximately 4,000 Jackson County retirees and their family members. Total annual economic impact was estimated at $100 million, including payrolls, contracts, goods, and services. NAVSTA Pascagoula epitomized the \\"clean sheet\\" design for a modern naval station. Waterfront support infrastructure at NAVSTA Pascagoula includes a 680-foot (205 m) double-deck pier (utilities on the lower deck; upper deck free for operational support), two quayside berths, and the full range of services for \\"cold iron\\" support of homeported and visiting ships. Ship maintenance and repair support is available from the Navy's Shore Intermediate Maintenance Activity (SIMA), or by contract (there are 17 major shipyards/marine contractors located along the Gulf Coast between New Orleans, La., and Panama City, Fla.). Tenant commands at NAVSTA Pascagoula included *Shore Intermediate Maintenance Activity, Pascagoula *Destroyer Squadron 6 *USCG Station Pascagoula  Base Realignment and Closure, 2005  Flag lowering during the disestablishment ceremony of Naval Station Pascagoula. NAVSTA Pascagoula was marked for consolidation under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's list of base closings in the May 2005 round. This was a blow to Mississippi Gulf Coast Congressman Gene Taylor (5th Congressional District) and Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott, who fought to get Pascagoula off the list in 1995. On 24 August 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure committee voted to include Naval Station Pascagoula on its final list of closures. The base officially closed 15 November 2006 with a disestablishment ceremony held 29 September 2006.

He has won two Dove awards, 1980 song of the year (for \\"He's Alive\\"), and 1980 Songwriter of the year. Background Don Francisco was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of a Christian seminary professor Clyde T. Francisco. Francisco's early career with the band Highway Robbery,http://badcatrecords.com/BadCat/HIGHWAYrobbery.htm centered on the folk-rock music common during the mid-1960s, but after an experience Francisco believed was supernatural, he rededicated his life to God and changed his personal, musical direction. Francisco is married and lives in Colorado with his wife, Wendy, also a recording artist as well as a graphic artist. In 1977 Don Francisco recorded \\"I Don't Care Where You've Been Sleeping\\" for the album Forgiven. It is one of the most uncompromising songs he has ever written and it is considered by many to be one of his best songs. Called \\"one of the best folk gospel ballads of all time\\" by Cashbox Magazine. Benson Records re- released the original album Forgiven along with Got to Tell Somebody, and put them both on one CD in 1988. That re-release left the song \\"I Don't Care Where You've Been Sleeping\\" off in order to fit both albums on one 70-minute CD.Original double CD pressing, dated 1988 However, they did release the Forgiven album in the early 1990s with that song on it, along with all others, on their \\"Right Price\\" line of CDs. Eventually after 1994, Don Francisco opted to operate independently, which, while affording him more control, seems to have had no ill effect on his musical output or quality. On the contrary, albums released after have gradually gained the use of further session work and demonstrate an even greater range of styles. In 2003 Francisco released The Promises, which consists almost entirely of selected and paraphrased readings from the Bible. The disk is a collaboration between Don and Wendy Francisco. Musical style Francisco's style is fairly distinctive, focusing on acoustic instruments barren of modern production techniques and concentrates on the narratives of the songs, using ballad styles or speaking through the music that interprets Scriptural events or Biblical lessons. This is specifically with respect to the teachings of Jesus Christ and his messages of \\"unconditional love\\" (\\"I Don't Care Where You've Been Sleeping\\"), salvation (\\"Give Your Heart a Home\\"), and a lesson against religious self-righteousness and pharisaic condemnation (\\"Beautiful To Me\\"). As is the case with many singer-songwriters advocating a specific religious belief or philosophical viewpoint through music, Francisco uses his adaptations and interpretations as the means to convey what he feels are the most important teachings of the JudeoChristian scriptures. Some of Don Francisco's songs deal with what his site calls Churchianity where the habit of church life replaces actual Christianity. Views on copyright Don Francisco retains full copyright on all of his work and holds a very liberal approach to sharing music. His original website used to provide free music downloads and actually encouraged copying with proper notice. The new website is still in development and doesn't yet have those pages, though Francisco still holds those views. This position is held on the basis of Christian love and a rare stand against the commercialization of Christianity. The updated website has a storefront as the landing page and is primarily used to market his merchandise. The free downloads are frequently done through his Facebook page, however, which has a following of 27,000 plus currently. The MP3s page does offer MP3s for any donation, however, if the shopper cannot afford the purchase price. Barred from the UK In March 2009, Don Francisco was scheduled to perform in an Easter music program in the English port town of Poole but was briefly barred from entering the United Kingdom. Francisco claimed that at London's Heathrow Airport he was detained and escorted by armed guards back to the United States, and was barred entry for listing his occupation as \\"gospel singer\\" and failing to obtain a religious worker visa, a new requirement under British law. That year the United Kingdom passed a new points-based immigration system that increased scrutiny for religious workers traveling to the country.

It is defined as the giving‚Äîgenerally without compensation‚Äîof embryos remaining after in vitro fertilization procedures to recipients for procreative implantation or research. Most IVF users with supernumerary embryos make embryo donation decisions after completing their families or discontinuing use of in vitro fertilization. Recipients of embryos donated for procreative implantation typically plan to transfer fresh or frozen embryos into a prepared uterus in order to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth. Recipients of embryos donated for research typically use them for clinical training, quality improvement research, or human embryonic stem cell research. For procreative implantation Embryo donation for procreative implantation is a form of third party reproduction. Embryo donation can be anonymous (donor and recipient parties are not known to each other, and individuals have no ability to contact one another), semi-open (parties can interact via a third party, but do not share personally identifiable information in order to provide a layer of privacy protection), open (party identities and contact information are shared so the families can interact directly in various types of relationships), or ID disclosure (donor- conceived youth can request and receive donor contact information when the donor-conceived reaches the age of 18). Any children born from embryo donation for procreation would be biologically related to the gamete donors used when creating the embryos. This is the same principle as is followed in egg donation or sperm donation.  Embryo donation or adoption  Some use the term \\"embryo donation\\" to refer strictly to anonymous embryo donation, and \\"embryo adoption\\" to refer to an open relationship. Others use the terms interchangeably because, regardless of the relationship, a clinical assisted reproduction procedure is involved, and the recipient couple is preparing to raise a child not genetically related to them. Lawyers who assist those trying to acquire an embryo state the term \\"embryo adoption\\" is a misnomer because the transfer of an embryo is handled as property transfer., 109-10 (2006)., The pro-lifers adopting 'spare' embryos created during IVF, , Oct. 8, 2013 (hereinafter cited as Blackhurst, Pro-lifers)Cheryl Wetzstein, Embryo adoption becoming the rage, , Apr. 19, 2009.

Another 21% want to donate leftover embryos for research.Pamela Brown Controversial embryo adoptions on the rise May 1, 2012 WJLA.COM Donating embryos for research may be a good alternative when patients receive proper, honest and clear information about the research project, the procedures and the scientific value of the research. The remaining 7% of those surveyed are willing to donate leftover embryos to another couple. Dr. Jeffrey Nelson is Director of the Huntington Reproductive Center, one of California's largest IVF clinics. He reports that \\"Twenty-five per cent of patients want to donate their [spare] embryos ‚Äì not as many as I'd like.\\" He added, \\"People tend to hold on to their embryos because they don't want to make a decision. We started buying more and more cryopreservation tanks, and we finally had to say that there's a fee for a certain number of years' storage, and beyond that the price starts to escalate.\\"Blackhurst, Pro-lifers. It costs up to $1,200 a year to store frozen embryos.Blackhurst, Pro-lifers As of May 2012, there were about 600,000 frozen embryos stored in laboratories and fertility clinics, costing the donor families about $72 million annually for storage fees.Craig Young Funding cut threatens Loveland-based program that encourages adoption of frozen embryos; women tell adoption stories March 10, 2012  Donor screening  In the United States, donors must, if possible, be screened for a series of infectious diseases.https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/TissueTissueProducts/QuestionsaboutTissues/ucm136397.htmhttp://www.miracleswaiting.org/explorembryo.html The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) administers the rules for screening donors. If the donors are not available to be screened, the embryos must be given a label that indicates that the required screening has not been done, and the recipients must agree to accept the associated risk. The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own embryologist conduct further testing. or donating them for use in embryonic stem cell research. Although embryos can, theoretically, survive indefinitely in frozen storage, as a practical reality someone must eventually decide on a permanent disposition for them. A US study concluded that donating an embryo is approximately twice as cost-effective as oocyte donation in terms of cost per live birth, with a cost of $22,000 per live delivery compared to $41,000 for oocyte donation.  History  Soon after in vitro fertilization became a common clinical practice, clinicians discovered a way to preserve embryos in frozen storage and thaw them for implantation later. This procedure can spare a woman donor from a second egg harvesting procedure.Trounson A, Freemann L. The use of embryo cryopreservation in human IVF programmes. Clin Obstet Gynaecol 1985 Dec;12(4):825-33Downing BG, Mohr LR, Trounson AO, Freemann LE, Wood C. Birth After Transfer of Cryopreserved Embryos. Med J Aust 1985 Apr 1;142(7):409-11 At about the same time, clinicians reasoned that more couples could be helped toward parenthood by substituting donor sperm for men who have no viable sperm, or donor eggs for women who have no viable oocytes ‚Äì or both. Thus what was called gamete and embryo donation, came into being. A careful reading of the 1983 clinical report often cited as the first instance of embryo donation reveals that the donated embryo was actually created for the recipient at the same time that four embryos were made for the donor couple's own use. The menstrual cycles of the donor and recipient women were synchronized using medications, and the transfers occurred on the same day. None of these embryos had been cryopreserved. Soon thereafter, reports were published documenting successful pregnancies and births from cryopreserved donor embryos. Again, however, these were embryos made from donor gametes specifically for the recipients. No one knows for sure when the first true embryo adoption occurred. The term was used as early as the mid-1980s,Robertson JA. Embryos, Families, and Procreative Liberty: the Legal Structure of the New Reproduction.

Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1989 Aug;96(8):900-906 Dr. Maria Bustillo in Florida, and Dr. Howard Jones in Virginia have reported embryo transfers occurring between 1986 and 1990 that clearly represented adoption of remaining embryos. Prior to this, thousands of women who were infertile had regarded adoption as the only available path to parenthood. These scientific advances set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of embryo donation and transfer as a solution to infertility. In some ways, it is similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. Some see the embryo as \\"tissue\\", others see it as a \\"gift of a potential life\\",National Embryo Donation Center: Questionnaire Study of Prospective Embryo Donors while still others believe that a new human life begins at the time of fertilization. The third group sees embryo donation as little different from traditional adoption, except that the recipient woman has the experience of pregnancy and childbirth, and that no court action is required to establish legal parentage for the recipient. The matter gained another political dimension in the United States when Congress and the Bush administration budgeted $1 million to promote embryo adoption.The White House. President Discusses Stem Cell Research. Office of the Press Secretary, August 9, 2001. https://georgewbush- whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010809-2.html  Process  Embryo donation is legally considered a property transfer and not an adoption by state laws. However, Georgia enacted a statute called the \\"Option of Adoption Act\\" in 2009 which provided a procedure for, but (importantly) did not require‚Äîa confirmatory court order of parentage following embryo adoption.http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/archive/20665/ One advantage some embryo adoption couples in Georgia have derived from this law is that they have become eligible for the federal Adoption Tax Credit. Embryo donation can be carried out as a service of an individual infertility clinic (where donor and recipient families typically live in the local area and are both patients of the same clinic) or by any of several national organizations. The process described below is typical of an \\"adoption-agency-based\\" national program. Genetic parents entering an embryo adoption program are offered the benefits of selecting the adoptive parents from the agency's pool of prescreened applicants. Embryo ownership is transferred directly from the genetic parents to the adoptive parents. Genetic parents may be updated by the agency when a successful pregnancy is achieved and when a child or children is/are born. The genetic parents and adoptive parents may negotiate their own terms for future contact between the families. Prospective adoptive parents entering a program complete an application, and may also complete a traditional adoption home study, fertility or adoption education, background and health checks and in some cases, depending on the requirements of both the home study and placement agencies, court certification of adoption eligibility. Their completed paperwork and fees are submitted to the placement agency, which reviews their file. Some agencies allow the donors to choose the recipient while others match the recipient parents with similar preferences including desired level of openness post-adoption. Genetic and prospective parents are then given the chance to approve the match. Once all parties agree, the embryo is transferred to the adoptive mother's clinic for a frozen embryo transfer. None of the procedures involved with embryo adoption by either the genetic or adopting parents are legal requirements of embryo transfer. The process is entered into willingly by both sets of parents because of the added safeguards, knowledge and communication offered to both parties by the system.Embryo Adoption & Donation For research Embryo donation to research provides a major source of stem cells for stem cell research. The hope is that stem cell research will aid in finding cures for various major diseases such as Alzheimer, cancer, SMA, and Parkinson's diseases. Some stem cell research is done by using human embryos, and one option that parents have once they are done with in vitro fertilization is to donate their unused embryos to stem cell research. One review came to the result that the proportion of IVF users who donated embryos for research varied geographically, from 7% in France to 73% in Switzerland. A study done in the United States revealed that 60% of American donors would donate the unused embryos to science. People who donate embryos for research often have been found in a review to report feelings of reciprocity towards science and medicine, positive views of research and high levels of trust in the medical system. They have described the decision to donate as better than the destruction of embryos, and as an opportunity to help others or to improve health and IVF technology. On the other hand, reported factors that make people refrain from embryo donation to research include a perception of risks, a lack of information concerning research projects and the medical system, as well as conceptualization of embryos in terms of personhood. The influence of sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive and gynecological history have mainly been found to be inconclusive.

He is probably best known for portraying Major Don West, the hot-tempered second in command of the Jupiter 2, in the CBS series Lost in Space (1965‚Äì1968). He also played Detective Sgt. Chris Ballard, The Detectives, starring Robert Taylor. Early life Charles Harvey Goddard was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the youngest of five children, and grew up in Scituate. He was raised Catholic.Excerpt from Mark Goddard's autobiography, books.google.com; accessed November 21, 2015. He led both his high school baseball and basketball teams to the state championship finals. Goddard dreamed of becoming a basketball player, but eventually turned to acting. He originally attended Holy Cross College after high school, but he then transferred and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. After two years, he moved to Los Angeles, California. Career In 1959, after just three weeks in Hollywood, he landed a role in the CBS Four Star Television series Johnny Ringo, having played the character of Cully, the deputy to Don Durant's character of Ringo. At this time, he changed his name to Mark Goddard at the suggestion of his friend and mentor Chuck Connors of The Rifleman. Goddard appeared as Norman Tabor in the 1960 episode \\"Surprise Party\\" of the CBS anthology series The DuPont Show with June Allyson. He was cast as Sheldon Hollingsworth in the 1960 episode \\"To See the Elephant\\" of the ABC Western series The Rebel, starring Nick Adams. He played Tod Rowland in the 1960 episode \\"The Mormons\\" on Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater. The Detectives, another production of Four Star Television, was a hit series which ran on ABC and NBC from 1958 to 1961; Goddard was signed for a role lasting three years (64 episodes). In 1963, Goddard appeared as Roy Mooney on the Perry Mason episode \\"The Case of the Potted Planter\\". In 1964 Goddard appeared as Richard on The Virginian in the episode titled \\"The Secret of Brynmar Hall.\\" In 1965, he played Lester Crawford in another Perry Mason, \\"The Case of the Frustrated Folk Singer\\". He also appeared with Keir Dullea as sparring college roommates in an episode of ABC's drama series Channing, costarring Jason Evers and Henry Jones. He was featured in the 1965 film A Rage to Live, starring Suzanne Pleshette. From 1964 to 1965, Goddard starred in Many Happy Returns, in which he portrayed Bob Randall, the young husband of Joan Randall, played by Elinor Donahue. Lost in Space Goddard's next role was for the three seasons of Lost in Space (1965‚Äì68), in which he played Major Don West. The original 1965 pilot was much different from the pilot that aired and the episodes that followed in the actual series. A blossoming romance existed between Don West and Judy, the elder daughter of the Robinson family, but it did not extend further than the first season. By the middle of the second season, the show took on a more comic tone, and instead of the love-relationship with Judy, Major West maintained a hate-relationship with the hapless, sociopathic Dr. Smith (played by Jonathan Harris). Plots increasingly drew on the mishaps of Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) and his friends, who could always be counted upon to save him and all of the inhabitants of the Jupiter II ‚Äî The Robot (animated by Bob May, voiced by Dick Tufeld) and Will Robinson (Bill Mumy), the youngest of the three Robinson children. Castmates included Guy Williams, the former star of Zorro (1957‚Äì59), as Professor John Robinson and the credited star of the series; June Lockhart, the former star of Lassie (1959‚Äì64), as Dr. Maureen Robinson; Marta Kristen as elder daughter Judy Robinson; and Angela Cartwright (one of the von Trapp children in The Sound of Music). On June 14, 1995, the rest of the cast and he paid tribute to producer Irwin Allen, who had died late in 1991. On October 16, 1997, (the same day the show's fictional Jupiter II spaceship departed in the original episode), Goddard and the rest of the surviving cast also appeared on the inside cover of TV Guide to promote the feature film of Lost in Space. At the same time, the Sci-Fi Channel had planned to do a Lost in Space marathon. Goddard, along with Harris and the rest of his cast, were planning in 2002 for the movie Lost in Space: The Journey Home to air on NBC, which never came to fruition. (Original star Guy Williams had retired from acting, moved to Buenos Aires, and had died in 1989, predeceasing Harris.) Later acting career Goddard guest-starred on three ABC series, The Fugitive, The Mod Squad, and The Fall Guy and for a while, moonlighted as a Hollywood agent. In 1976, he starred as politician Edward Fleming in the movie Blue Sunshine. In 1970, Goddard co-starred with Kent McCord and Martin Milner in an episode of Adam-12, in which he plays a friend of Pete Malloy (Milner), who is killed in the line of duty. The episode was entitled \\"Elegy for a Pig\\" (so titled and announced by Jack Webb himself). Goddard played a supporting role in a first-season episode of NBC's Quincy M.E. as an attorney. In 1978, Goddard starred with Liza Minnelli on Broadway in the musical The Act. In 1979, Goddard was in the disco movie Roller Boogie featuring Linda Blair and Jim Bray. Goddard starred as Ted Clayton on One Life to Live and Lt. Paul Reed on The Doctors. Later, Goddard starred as Derek Barrington on General Hospital. He made a cameo appearance in the reboot film Lost in Space (1998) as the general in charge of the Jupiter Mission and superior officer to his former character Major Don West. Personal life Goddard finished college 30 years after beginning his studies and received his master's degree in education from Bridgewater State College. From 1991 through at least 2009, he served as a special education teacher at the F.L. Chamberlain School in Middleboro, Massachusetts, where he taught an acting class. In 2009, he released an autobiographical memoir To Space and Back. While at Bridgewater State College, he met his future wife, English professor Evelyn Pezzulich. The couple has one child, John. His second wife, actress Susan Anspach, brought two children to their marriage.

He was also given the honorific title of cardinal. He was elected Patriarch of Antioch for the Maronites on 27 April 1986, and his resignation was accepted on 26 February 2011. He was the 76th patriarch of the Maronite Church, with the official title of \\"His Beatitude the 76th Patriarch of Antioch and the Whole Levant\\". Early life and ordination Nasrallah Sfeir was born in Rayfoun, Lebanon, on 15 May 1920. He was educated in Beirut, and at Mar Abda School in Harharaya where he completed his primary and complementary studies, and Ghazir where he completed his secondary studies at St. Maron seminary. He graduated in philosophy and theology in 1950 at Saint Joseph's University in Beirut. He was ordained to the priesthood in the same year on 7 May. From 1951 to 1955 he served as priest to the parish of Rayfoun. In 1956, he was appointed the secretary of the Maronite Patriarchate, based in Bkerk√©. In the same year, he became professor of translation in literature and philosophy at the Fr√®res Maristes (Marist Brothers) School in Jounieh. On 23 June 1961 Sfeir was appointed Titular bishop and Patriarchal vicar. On 16 July 1961, he was consecrated the titular bishop of Tarsus by Patriarch Paul Peter Meouchi and had as his co- consecrators Jo√£o Chedid, Titular bishop of Arca in Phoenicia dei Maroniti, and Michael Doumith, Eparch of Sarba. Consequently, Sfeir served as Patriarchal vicar. Patriarch He was elected to the primacy of the Maronite Church by the Council of Maronite Bishops, on 19 April 1986, and he was confirmed by Pope John Paul II on 7 May 1986. Liturgy Sfeir was keen on accelerating liturgical reforms. This work bore fruit in 1992 with the publication of a new Maronite Missal, which represents an attempt to return to the original form of the Antiochene Liturgy. Its Service of the Word has been described as far more enriched than previous Missals, and it features six Anaphoras (Eucharistic Prayers). Role during the civil war Serving as the Vicar for two previous patriarchs prepared Sfeir for the role in both the ecclesiastical and civil spheres. He became a strong voice for reason and sanity in the latter years of the Lebanese Civil War, which raged from 1975 to 1990. He often spoke out against social and political injustices, and for the poor and disenfranchised. His writings and sermons set out his vision of how Lebanon could achieve a free and prosperous future. Like his predecessor, Sfeir largely stayed out of politics during the first few years of his tenure as patriarch, generally deferring to the stance of the Lebanese President, but by 1989 he had become embroiled in national politics. Resignation Cardinal Sfeir submitted his resignation to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in Rome in late 2010, but his resignation was not initially accepted because six Maronite bishops had submitted their resignations after reaching the retirement age of 75 in June 2010 His resignation was finally accepted by Pope Benedict XVI on 26 February 2011. Cardinal Sfeir was succeeded by Bishop Bechara Boutros Rahi who was elected as the new Patriarch for Antioch on 15 March 2011. Cardinal Sfeir was made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 26 November 1994. As the patriarch of a sui juris particular church who has been made a cardinal, Sfeir was a cardinal bishop. He did not participate in the conclaves of 2005 and 2013, having already reached the age limit of 80. Works Sfeir wrote several books, including \\"The sources of the Gospel-Bkerk√©\\", (1975); \\"Personalities that disappeared 1961‚Äì1974\\", (two volumes); and \\"Sunday sermons: spiritual reflections and stand of national positions\\", (several volumes, 1988). Sfeir was fluent in many languages: Syriac, French, Italian, Aramaic and Latin, as well as his native Arabic, being proficient in both classical and Lebanese dialects. Involvement in politics=Spring of 1989 The cardinal found himself both within the Syrian camp and outside it. At the beginning of the 1990s he did not support Syria's role against General Michel Aoun. In the spring of 1989, when Aoun launched a campaign to achieve control of militia-dominated areas, 23 Christian deputies of parliament met at the seat of the Maronite Church in Bkerk√©, under the auspices of Sfeir, and called for a cease-fire. While hundreds of thousands Lebanese (Christians and non-Christians) gathered in the Baadba presidential palace in support of Aoun, a couple thousand Christians demonstrated in Bkerki against Aoun. Under what some say was pressure from the Vatican, he backed the Taif Agreement and hence the Syrian mandate over Lebanon in order to end the civil war, saying that it would be \\"a fatal error to believe that we can live alone on an island in which we run our affairs as we like.\\" A few days later, he declared that Aoun's nonacceptance of the Taif Agreement was illegal and unconstitutional. On 5 November, as parliamentary deputies met at the abandoned Qoleiat air base in Syrian-controlled North Lebanon to elect a new president, Sfeir warned in a sermon that Aoun's stand \\"would lead to partitioning of the country.\\" Opposition within the Church The patriarch's authority was challenged even within the Church itself, as several monastic orders issued proclamations supporting Aoun and denouncing the Taif Agreement. To bolster the patriarch's authority, the Vatican became directly involved in reorganizing the Maronite Church. Speaking before a gathering of Lebanese bishops in November 1989, the papal nuncio in Lebanon, Pablo Puente, condemned \\"the interference of clerical persons and institutions in politics without being officially mandated by the church hierarchy. ...An end must be put to political visits and declarations that have no clear Church mandate.\\" The Vatican later sought to temper nationalist views in the clergy by appointing \\"visiting bishops\\" to supervise three especially militant monastic orders. In 1990 Sfeir called for the rival government in West Beirut to take over Aoun's \\"Christian enclave\\" in the east. \\"The legitimate government should spread its authority over the whole nation,\\" he said in one interview. \\"It should not wait for an invitation from anyone to do so.\\" Finally on October 13, 1990, the Syrian Army crushed Aoun's insurgency and the long civil war finally came to an end. Aoun's main objection to the Taif Agreement was that it had no firm timetable for Syrian withdrawal and that it abolished most of the Maronite president's powers, giving them to the Sunni Prime Minister. The Syrians went on to occupy Lebanon for another 15 years. Cedar Revolution The Syrian invasion was \\"forced\\" under international pressure to withdraw its forces from Lebanon, after the political upheaval and large scale street protests which followed the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri (see Cedar Revolution); at the end of April 2005, Sfeir was at times a vocal critic of Syrian prevarication in carrying out its pledge to withdraw, up until around 2003, falling silent again just as anti-Syrian views were becoming more widespread. His restraint in his comments at this time appeared to have lost him the support, in particular, of a majority among those Christians who had fled the country. The cardinal also urged restraint in anti-Syrian rhetoric, and for Lebanon to focus on its economic development rather than political rifts. Nevertheless, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese (mostly Christians) gathered in Bkerke and the roads leading to it on March 27, 2001, to welcome back the cardinal from a tour in the United States, during which he asked for the withdrawal of the Syrian army. He blessed in 2001 the establishment of Christian Qornet Shehwan Gathering opposed to the Syrian role and in the aftermath of the Hariri assassination he restated his opposition to Syria's predominant role in Lebanese politics, and the political changes following Syrian withdrawal appeared to have largely restored his previous position as the main spokesperson for his community. Reaction to political paralysis 280px In the first half of 2006 the cardinal was critical of the political paralysis created by the controversy over whether President √âmile Lahoud should serve the remainder of his term of office (which was specially extended under Syrian pressure in 2004 until November 2007). At the same time, he stressed that Lahoud should be removed only by lawful and constitutional means and that the continued smooth functioning of government and a national consensus on his successor were the main priorities. In order to discuss the July 2006 Israel-Lebanon war and American policy on the affair, he met with Vice President Dick Cheney at the White House, and later talked with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Relations with the Free Patriotic Movement On 15 October 2006, the Christian Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) held gatherings in which anti-patriarchal slogans were raised, denouncing Cardinal Sfeir's political stands which they consider contradictory to the will of the FPM Christians in Lebanon. The FPM bloc, led by retired general and current president Michel Aoun, constitutes the largest Christian bloc in the Lebanese parliament. Relations between the cardinal and the FPM and Hezbollah further deteriorated when the patriarch made an eleventh hour appeal directly before the 2009 elections renouncing Hezbollah and the FPM and warning Christians against voting for them. Many believe the stance severely cut Christian support for the March 8 Alliance, especially when Aoun emerged as the biggest loser in the 2009 elections according to some estimates. The FPM blame the cardinal for making them lose 20% of Christian support using religious rhetoric, and for not objecting against the transfer of 15,000 Sunni voters from Beqaa villages to the Christian district of Zahle, which lost the FPM 8 MP's there. Currently the FPM and its allies have one out of twelve orthodox seats, two out of eight catholic seats, two out of six Armenian seats and almost half of Maronite seats with the rest belonging to 14 March. But FPM still retains the biggest Christian single parliamentary block of 27 MPs, which includes MPs from other parties such as the Marada Movement as well as independent, pro-Syrian government personalities. Also not all of the Change and Reform bloc MPs are Christians.

Waldo Dean Waterman (June 16, 1894 ‚Äì December 8, 1976) was an inventor and aviation pioneer from San Diego, California. He developed a series of tailless swept-wing aircraft incorporating tricycle landing gear, culminating in a low cost and simple to fly flying car. Biography Waterman built his first aircraft, a biplane hang glider, in 1909 while still in high school. He successfully flew the biplane hang glider on a slope near his home and by auto-tow. He then took on a partner to help build a powered aircraft that he entered in the first Dominguez Air Meet in January 1910. The aircraft was not completed in time for the meet. However, he began testing the aircraft on North Island. It was under-powered and required an auto-tow assist to get airborne. He flew the aircraft with some success but crashed, breaking both ankles. In 1911, Glenn Curtiss moved his winter headquarters to North Island and Waterman attached himself to the Curtiss camp. In early 1912, the US Navy moved its three aircraft to Curtiss' testing station. By this time Waterman was a fixture at the station and was a frequent ride-along. In 1912, Waterman entered the University of California as a student of mechanical engineering. When World War I broke out, and after being rejected from military service because of his broken ankles and flat feet, he became head of the Department of Theory of Flight, School of Military Aeronautics at the University of California. Later he became Chief Engineer at the U.S. Aircraft Corporation and remained to liquidate the company at the end of the war. With some assets purchased from the U.S. Aircraft Corporation, Waterman moved to Santa Monica, where he became test pilot for Bach Aircraft and established the Waterman Aircraft Manufacturing Company. However, he was forced out of business when the U.S. Army began dumping war-surplus aircraft on the civilian market for a tiny fraction of what Waterman could sell his custom aircraft for. In 1929, Waterman built his first tailless monoplane, the Whatsit, which also used the then unusual tricycle landing gear. It had a swept wing, following the work of British pioneer J. W. Dunne on his Dunne D.7 of 1911. The Whatsit had a truncated fuselage and a forward trim plane. A development of the Whatsit was the high-wing Waterman Arrowplane.Meaden, 1988 As well as the Whatsit, in 1930 Waterman produced another innovative design with a low-wing monoplane that could change the dihedral of its wings during flight for shorter takeoffs, increased flight speed, and slower landing speeds according to the designer in its debut at the National Air races in Chicago. In addition to the wing design, he also placed the landing gears not under the fuselage but outwards under the wings.\\"Plane With Variable Wing Makes Flying Safer\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1930 The Waterman Aerobile at the Smithsonian. At North Island, while experimenting with the Navy's flying boats, Glenn Curtiss is known to have talked about the possibility of a flying car. In 1917 he built a flying car he called the Autoplane. The Autoplane never flew, but was exhibited at the Pan-American Aeronautic Exposition in New York City's Grand Central Palace. Waterman was certainly inspired by Curtiss and 20 years later made one of the first successful flying cars. The Waterman Arrowbile was based on the Arrowplane. It was a high-wing monoplane, with detachable wings and was powered by a Studebaker engine. Five Arrowbiles were built. Three Arrowbiles attempted a flight from Santa Monica to Cleveland but one had to turn back after only reaching Arizona. The other two finished the flight. Arrowbile No. 6 (No. 5 was never completed), rechristened the Aerobile is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center (Smithsonian Air and Space museum extension in Dulles, Virginia). In the 1960s, Waterman built and flew his last aircraft. The Early Bird was based on the original Curtiss Pusher. The Chevybird was a similar monoplane powered by a Corvair engine. In the early 1970s, Waterman directed the construction of a replica of his biplane hang glider, built in his youth. This was done in conjunction with Michael Riggs of Seagull Aircraft, based in one of Waterman's Santa Monica buildings. Waterman gave Joe Faust of the Self-Soar Association $100 to support its Low & Slow periodical, in which notes about Waldo Waterman's final aircraft construction project appeared. In 1968, Waterman was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. .

Historians have attributed the decline of the city to a series of raids by Muslim Albanian bandits. Moscopole was initially attacked and almost destroyed by those groups in 1769 following the participation of the residents in the preparations for a Greek revolt supported by the Russian Empire. Its destruction culminated with the abandoning and destruction of 1788.Hermine G. De Soto, Nora Dudwick. Fieldwork dilemmas: anthropologists in postsocialist states. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2000. , p. 45. Moscopole, once a prosperous city, was reduced to a small village by Ali Pasha. According to another opinion, the city's decline was mainly due to the relocation of the trade routes in central and eastern Europe following these raids. Today Moscopole, known as Voskopoj√´, is a small mountain village, and along with a few other local settlements is considered a holy place by local Orthodox Christians. It was one of the original homelands of the Aromanian diaspora.Gilles de Rapper. Religion on the border: Sanctuaries and festivals in post-communist Albania.

History=ProsperityDemographics= The coat of arms of Moscopole. Although located in a rather isolated place in the mountains of southern Albania, the city rose to become the most important center of the Aromanians. It was a small settlement until the end of the 17th century, but afterwards showed a remarkable financial and cultural development. Some writers have claimed that Moscopole in its glory days (1730‚Äì1760) had as many as 70,000 inhabitants; other estimates placed its population closer to 35,000;Peyfuss, p. 35-36 snippet viewRobert Elsie's review on Peyfuss but a more realistic number may be closer to 3500: \\"...The truth may be closer to this number [sc. 3500] than to 70,000. Moschopolis was certainly not among the largest Balkan cities of the 18th century\\".Max Demeter Peyfuss. Die Druckerei von Moschopolis, 1731‚Äì1769: Buchdruck und Heiligenverehrung im Erzbistum Achrida. B√∂hlau, 1989, , p. 35‚Äì36 According to the Swedish historian Johann Thunmann, who visited Moscopole and wrote a history of the Aromanians in 1774, everyone in the city spoke Aromanian; many also spoke Greek, which was used for writing contracts, in fact the city is said to have been mainly populated by Vlachs/Aromanians. The fact was confirmed by a 1935 analysis of the family names shows that the majority of the population were indeed Vlachs, but there were also Greeks and Albanians present in the city. =Economy= Murals of St. Nicholas church, painted by David Selenica. Historically the main economic activity of the city was the livestock farming. The alternative name \\"Voskopolis\\" means \\"City of shepherds\\". This activity led to the establishment of wool processing and carpet manufacturing units and the development of tanneries, while other locals became metal workers, silver and copper smiths. During the middle of the 18th century, the city became an important economic center whose influence spread over the boundaries of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, and reached further the Ottoman ruled Eastern-Orthodox world: the trade involved as far as the Archduchy of Austria, the Kingdom of Hungary, and the Upper Saxony. Until 1769, the town traded on a large scale with renowned European commercial centres of that time, such as Venice, Vienna and Leipzig. =Culture= A printing press was also operating in Moscopole which was the second one in Ottoman Europe (in ,) after that of Constantinople. This establishment produced a total of nineteen books, mainly Services to the Saints but also the Introduction of Grammar by the local scholar Theodore Kavalliotis. The later became director of the city's prestigious educational institution, which from 1744 was known as New Academy or Hellenikon Frontistirion, sponsored by the wealthy merchants of the diaspora. Moreover, the city hosted an orphanage, known as Orphanodioiketerion, probably the first in the post-Byzantine Orthodox world, a hospital and a total of 24 churches. A cultural effervescence arose in Moscopole, and many authors published their works in both the Greek language (which was the language of culture of the Balkans at the time) and Aromanian, written in the Greek alphabet. In 1770, the first dictionary of four modern Balkan languages (Greek, Albanian, Vlach/Aromanian and Bulgarian) was published here. Daniel Moscopolites a Vlach-speaking native priest of Moscopole, compiled a quadrilingual lexicon of Greek, Vlach, Bulgarian and Albanian, that aimed at the hellenization of the non-Greek- speaking Christian communities in the Balkans.Friedman A. Victor. After 170 years of Balkan linguistics. Wither the Millennium? University of Chicago. p. 2: \\"...given the intent of these comparative lexicons was the Hellenization of non-Greek-speaking Balkan Christians... Due to the high level of intellectual activity and Greek education Moscopole was nicknamed as New Athens or New Mystra.Asterios I. Koukoudƒìs. The Vlachs: Metropolis and Diaspora. 2003.

The survivors were thus forced to flee, most of them emigrating mainly to Thessaly and Macedonia. Some of the commercial elite moved to the Archduchy of Austria, and the Kingdom of Hungary especially to the respective capitals of Vienna and Budapest, but also to Transylvania, where they had an important role in the early National awakening of Romania. The city never rose back to its earlier status. However, a new school was established at the end of the 18th century whose headmaster in 1802 was Daniel Moscopolites. This school functioned the following decades, thanks to donations and bequests by baron Simon Sinas, a member of the diaspora. In 1900, a report by the Greek consul Betsos gave details of the demographic composition of Moscopole. It noted that the 18th century destruction of the settlement resulted in the dispersal of its Aromanian speaking population and the some old remaining families moved to other places, in particular Kor√ß√´. Around 30 old families remained, however the socio-political crisis that engulfed the nearby Opar region resulted in Albanian speaking Christians leaving their previous homes and resettling in Moscopole. Aromanians from two nearby settlements also resettled in Moscopole. Moscopole in 1900 was populated by a total of 200 families, consisting of 120 Albanian speaking and 80 Aromanian speaking families. Most of the older Aromanian speaking families had a Greek national consciousness while 3 families along with some of the newer residents were pro-Romanian (a total of 20 families), led by an unfrocked priest named Kosmas. \\"A report by Betsos, the Greek consul in Monastir, is very informative about the demographic composition of Moschopolis in 1900. Moscopolis: The old Vlach-speaking inhabitants of Moscopolis dispersed in all directions at the end of the eighteenth century, because the Moslem Albanians living round about pillages that once famed city, and the comparatively few remaining families gradually moved elsewhere, particularly to Kor√ß√´, which slowly became an important commercial centre. Of the old Vlach families, only about thirty remain in Moscopolis; but on the other hand, the widespread disorder ravaging the area of Opar has caused many Albanian speaking families to leave the barren, mountainous parts of the country and remove to Moscopolis, where they till the land and raise livestock. Able Vlach-speaking families came from two Vlach settlements to Moscopolis, of which the entire population at present amounts to 200 families, of which 120 are Albanian-speaking and the remaining 80 Vlach speaking. All the old Vlach- speaking families have remained true to [their Greek national consciousness], but for three, who, together with some of the newcomers, have been led astray by the unfrocked priest Kosmas. The Romanising families there number twenty in all.\\" In 1914 Moscopole was part of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. It was destroyed again in 1916 during World War I by the marauding Albanian bands of Sali Butka.Badlands, borderlands: a history of Northern Epirus/Southern Albania. Tom Winnifrith. Duckworth, 2002. , p. 61. During the Greco-Italian War, on 30 November 1940, the town was controlled by the advancing Greek forces. In April 1941, after the capitulation of Greece, Moscopole returned to Axis control. The remaining buildings were razed three times during the partisan warfare of World War II: once by Italian troops and twice by the Albanian nationalist Balli Komb√´tar organization. Of the old city, six Orthodox churches (one in a very ruined state), a bridge and a monastery survive. In 1996, the church of St. Michael was vandalized by three adolescent Albanians under the influence of a foreign Muslim fundamentalist. In 2002, the five standing churches were put on the World Monuments Fund's Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites Modern town Today, Moscopole is just a small mountain village and ski resort. Nonetheless, memories of glory days of Moscopole remain an important part of the culture of the Aromanians. During recent years, a Greek language institution, a joint Greek-Albanian initiative, has operated in Moscopole. Moscopole, known in Albania as being a traditionally Christian settlement is neighbours with various Muslim and Christian Albanian villages that surround it, although the latter have become \\"demographically depressed\\", due to migration. During the communist period some Muslim Albanians from surrounding villages settled in Moscopole making locals view the village population as mixed (i p√´rzier) and lamenting the decline of the Christian element. Orthodox churches and monasteries Decorated exonarthex of St. Athanasius' Church Ruined St. Charalampus' Church The remaining churches in the region are among the most representative of 18th century ecclesiastical art in the Balkans. Characteristically, their murals are comparable to that in the large monastic centres at Mount Athos and Meteora in Greece. The architectural design is in general specific and identical: a large three-aisled basilica with a gable roof. The churches are single-apsed, with a wide altar apse and internal niches that serve as prothesis and diaconicon. Most churches also have one niche, each on the northern and southern walls, next to the prothesis and the diaconicon. Along the southern side there is an arched porch. Of the ca. 24‚Äì30 churches of Moscopole, besides the St. John the Baptist Monastery (, ) in the vicinity of the town, only five have survived into modern times: *Saint Nicholas (, ) *Dormition of the Theotokos (, ) *Saint Athanasius (, ) *Saint Michael or Archangels Michael and Gabriel (, ) *Saint Elijah (, ) Some of the ruined churches include the following: *Saint Paraskevi (, ), patron saint of the town and probably the first church built in Moscopole in the 15th century. *Saint Charalampus (, ), outer walls partially survived *Saint Euthymius, completely destroyed. Climate There is a combination of mild valley climate in the lower parts and true Alpine climate in the higher regions. Favorable climate conditions make this center ideal for winter, summer, sport, recreation tourism, so there are tourists during the whole year, not only from areas of Albania, but also foreigners.

Early life and career  Christodoulos was born in Xanthi, Thrace, Northern Greece in 1939. His civil name was Christos Paraskevaidis. When he was two years old, his family moved to Athens to escape German and Bulgarian occupation of the area during World War II. His father subsequently returned to Xanthi following the war and ran a successful bid for mayor. Christodoulos attended high school at the Roman Catholic Marist Leonteion Lyceum of Athens.S. B.

He worked as a parish priest in Palaio Faliro, a suburb of Athens, between 1965 and 1974. During that time he also became Chief Secretary of the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece. In 1974, he was elected bishop of Demetrias in Volos, Thessaly, a post which he held until his election as Archbishop of Athens in 1998.Biography of Archbishop Christodoulos, website of the Church of Greece. Christodoulos was a Doctor of Theology, had a degree in French and English, and also spoke Italian and German. He was the author of a number of theological books and received Honorary Doctorates from the University of Craiova and the University of Iasi. Due to Christodoulos' attending a Catholic high school, he felt open to dialogue between the Orthodox and Catholic churches having experienced both sides.  Tenure as Archbishop  Christodoulos succeeded Archbishop Seraphim to the seat of the Prelate of the Greek church in 1998. At 59 years of age, he was the youngest Archbishop to head the Greek Church. His chief rivals in ballot were Metropolitan Anthimos of Alexandroupolis and Metropolitan Ieronymos of Thebes. The latter would eventually succeed him in 2008. Supporting the existing Church social services, he launched new services to face social issues such as the welfare of drug addicts and immigrants, the support for single mothers and abused women, the care for the victims of trafficking, the establishing of a chain of nurseries and infant schools, the provided assistance to poor families and families with many children. He also established \\"Solidarity\\", an NGO of the Church of Greece, which allowed a humanitarian intervention of the Church on an international level in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. \\"Solidarity\\" caused several controversies, such as the case where it received 5.6 million Euros from the Greek State in order to send humanitarian relief to Iraq.

The rift was mended a month later. The visit of Pope John Paul II in Athens and Archbishop Christodoulos' visit to Pope Benedict XVI in Rome were significant steps towards the cause of Church unity.Biography of Archbishop Christodoulos, website of the Church of Greece On May 20, 2001, Konstantinos Poulios (ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÇ Œ†ŒøœçŒªŒπŒøœÇ in Greek), an Old Calendarist, attacked Christodoulos and slapped him in the face, while the Archbishop was giving an interview to a TV crew outside the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens.Eleftherotypia, 21/5/2001 The attack was broadcast on live television; Poulios was arrested by Christodoulos' police bodyguards, but in the end he faced no charges.  Views  250px  Support for Serbia  The Archbishop played a leading role in supporting Serbia (a mainly Orthodox country), and stoking public opposition to NATO and the Kosovo War of 1999 in which Greece, as a NATO member, played a significant, though largely non-interventionist, role. He also spoke out strongly against the intention of the Greek government under Costas Simitis to follow EU directives, especially where they clashed with what he regarded as traditional Greek policies.\\"New Greek Orthodox archbishop enthroned\\", BBC News, 1998-05-09 Shortly after his swearing in, Christodoulos stated that it was \\"a disgrace for the modern Greeks to decide on the basis of what directives from Brussels might ask, at one time or another.  Identity cards controversy  In 2000, a major clash between church and state erupted when the then Greek socialist government sought to follow a decision of the Greek Data Protection Authority, by removing the \\"Religion\\" field from the national ID cards carried by Greek citizens. Christodoulos opposed the decision, complaining that socialist prime minister Costas Simitis did not consult with the Greek Church on the matter and saying that it was part of a wider plan to marginalise the Church from Greek public life; he also stated that the decision was \\"put forward by neo-intellectuals who want to attack us like rabid dogs and tear at our flesh\\".Greek church at war over plans to change ID cards, The Guardian, 22 May 2000 The archbishop organised two demonstrations in Athens and Thessaloniki, alongside a majority of bishops of the Church of Greece, supporting the inclusion of religious data on a voluntary basis, and asked for a referendum on the matter. For this purpose, he was greatly supported as more than three million Greek citizens signed and asked for a referendum. In 2001, Christodoulos prompted international criticism after saying that the ID decision had been instigated by Jews.\\"Religious row blazes over Greek identity\\", BBC News, 2001-03-15 The Central Board of the Jewish Community in Greece subsequently sent him a letter on 20 March 2001, asking him to clarify the matter and expressing their opposition to the mandatory writing of religious status in identity cards.H ŒïŒöŒöŒõŒóŒ£ŒôŒë Œ§ŒóŒ£ ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒîŒüŒ£ : ŒöŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ œÉŒµŒªŒØŒ¥Œ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒëœÅœáŒπŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÄŒøœÖ The Archbishop replied in a letter that his source was the official web site of the USA Jewish Community where it was stated that the US Jewish Community had asked the Greek Government to remove religious status from Greek identity cards. He also said that in Israel, the writing of religious status in identity cards is mandatory.H ŒïŒöŒöŒõŒóŒ£ŒôŒë Œ§ŒóŒ£ ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒîŒüŒ£ : ŒöŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ œÉŒµŒªŒØŒ¥Œ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒëœÅœáŒπŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÄŒøœÖ The official position of the Greek Church became that the writing of religious status on identity cards should be optional. However, the Greek Government proceeded to remove the writing of religious status completely from new identity cards.  Military junta  It emerged the same year that despite Christodoulos' saying that he had no knowledge of nor involvement with human rights violations by the Greek military junta of 1967-1974, because those seven years he was busy studying to become a priest, he had been present in the swearing-in ceremony of the new regime Photo of a younger Christodoulos after the swearing-in of the Regime of the Colonels. while he held the office of Arch-Secretary of the \\"Holy Synod\\", the collective council of Metropolitan bishops of the Church of Greece. At the same time, he was serving as chief advisor to Archbishop Hieronymus, a regime appointee and supporter.  Ecumenical relations  Christodoulos consented in 2001 to the Greek government's decision to allow Pope John Paul II to visit Greece. He commented that he would not \\"close the door\\" on the Pope, because he was coming to the country as a pilgrim. The two men met for discussions during the Papal visit in May 2001, though they did not pray together. Christodoulos' decision led to major controversy in Greece, where many Orthodox Christians regard the Pope (and the Catholic Church as a whole) as a schismatic heretic.\\"Pope breaks new ground\\", BBC News, 2001-05-03 He also consented in 2002 to the construction of a mosque in Athens, to end the fact that Athens is the only EU capital without a Muslim place of worship. On the other hand, he asked that the mosque will be outside the city center, a wish that was granted by the government who chose a site 20 km outside Athens against the wishes of the Muslim community.\\"Olympic city to build first mosque\\", BBC News, 2002-10-29 As of 2009 the mosque has still not been built.\\"Œ£œÑŒπœÇ œÖœÄŒøœÉœáŒ≠œÉŒµŒπœÇ Œ≠ŒºŒµŒπŒΩŒµ œÑŒø œÑŒ∂Œ±ŒºŒØ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±\\", To Vima, 2009-04-12 Archbishop Christodoulos visited Pope Benedict XVI in Rome in 2006. They issued a common proclamation together that included the statement that: \\"We look forward to a fruitful collaboration to enable our contemporaries to rediscover the Christian roots of the European Continent which forged the different nations and contributed to developing increasingly harmonious links between them. This will help them live and promote the fundamental human and spiritual values for all people, as well as the development of their own societies\\"  Role of the clergy in Greek schools  In 2006, Greek newspapers reported the Archbishop's displeasure at a decision by the centre-right government of New Democracy under Kostas Karamanlis to discontinue the practice of allowing Greek Orthodox priests to use public schools for confessionary purposes. Until then, calling in priests to hold private confession sessions within schools, was at the discretion of local educational authorities; the sessions took place on a voluntary basis for children. Greek media reported that the Archbishop characterised the move a \\"hostile act\\" against the Church, while the Synod of the Greek Orthodox Church, presided by Christodoulos, sent a letter of complaint to the Ministry for National Education and Religious Affairs under Marietta Giannakou. The decision, however, was applauded by representatives of the Greek Teachers' Association, who supported it as a measure that safeguarded freedom of belief and fostered respect for cultural and religious differences in schools.  Greek politics  Christodoulos supported views on Greek politics and culture that were criticized by The New York Times, an American newspaper owned by the Sulzberger family, as conservative and nationalist and supported by others as \\"standing up\\" for Greece and Greek culture. He led protests in 2002 against Greece's version of the television programme Big Brother, urging followers to \\"pray for the young kids\\" on the shows and to \\"turn off our television sets\\".\\"Ban on Greek Big Brother overturned\\", BBC News, 2002-03-22.  Greek history  The Archbishop attacked the authors of the Greek elementary schools' official state sixth-grade history book, accusing them of attempting to \\"enslave Greek youth\\" and conceal the Church's role in defending Greek national identity during Ottoman occupation. In reference to the same issue, he has castigated the \\"yannisaries\\" (i.e. traitors to the Greek nation) \\"who dare raise an audacious head and question unimpeachable things\\". The state issued textbook was later removed in 2007 by the Greek Government, after the Athens Academy, a Legal Entity of Public Law supervised by the Ministry of National Education and Religion, as well as a number of Greek historians and intellectuals also criticised the book for historical inaccuracies.  Globalization  The Archbishop was intensely critical of globalisation, to which he referred, on repeated occasions, in disparaging terms as a global, or alternatively, \\"foreigner\\" plot to deprive people of their national identities. In 2004 he criticized globalisation as a \\"bulldozer that is out to demolish everything, on account of those who want to rule the world without resistance or obstacles\\", adding that Greeks live in a paradise compared to other Europeans, because \\"they have a strong faith, they build churches, follow traditions, and resist globalisation\\". In 2006, he castigated globalisation as a \\"crime against humanity\\" and \\"a vehicle to Americanise the life of all humankind\\". He has also said that \\"globalisation wants to turn us into gruel, soup, sheep, or better yet, turkeys, so that we may be led with a cane\\". In 2002, he asked students in a Greek school whether they wanted to be \\"mince meat or meat\\", explaining that \\"foreigners want to turn us into the meat-grinder, while meat is a solid thing\\". On another occasion he stated that \\"the forces of Darkness cannot stand it [that Greece is a predominantly Orthodox country], and for this reason they want to decapitate it and flatten everything, by means of globalization, the novel deity that has appeared alongside another deity called human rights, and on account of which they expect us to curtail our own rights\\".http://ta- nea.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=A&f;=18233&m;=P52&aa;=2 In 2006, he decried the establishment of the monotonic orthography, as a \\"globalization plot\\" to impose \\"cultural uniformity\\" and \\"support the sale of multi-national Olivetti's typewriters\\". He also sarcastically referred to the lawmakers' \\"kindness of relieving our race from the darkness of Aristophanes\\", with regards to the same matter.  Human rights  Some comments by the archbishop on human rights also raised controversy. During a 2006 speech, Christodoulos stated that the Church is bound to \\"come into many conflicts with the movement for human rights\\", despite the fact \\"it not only does not oppose human rights, but supersedes them\\". His proposed reason for these conflicts is that \\"the Church cannot accept what the Lord of This World is promoting through the human rights movement : the abolishment of sin\\". The Archbishop has attributed human rights to a ploy by Satan on a second occasion, stating that \\"the forces of Darkness cannot stand it [that Greece is a predominantly Orthodox country], and for this reason they want to decapitate it and flatten everything, by means of globalization, the novel deity that has appeared alongside another deity called human rights, and on account of which they expect us to curtail our own rights\\". The Archbishop was also criticised for frequently judging the internal and foreign policies of the elected Greek governments, usually during sermons in the liturgy. In 1999, he complained during a sermon that the Education Ministries were \\"experimenting on students\\" with their continuous innovations on the educational system, causing the dissatisfaction of then Minister Gerasimos Arsenis, who was pushing substantial changes in secondary education at the time.  Enlightenment philosophy  Christodoulos frequently criticized the principles and values of what he characterized \\"the atheist Enlightenment\\", and which he contrasted to Christian values.  Turkey and the European Union  Christodoulos created a major controversy in 2003 when he denounced proposals to let Turkey enter the European Union, calling the Turks \\"barbarians\\".\\"Greek archbishop brands Turks 'barbarians'\\", BBC News, 2003-12-05 Despite the fact a number of Greeks are also opposed to Turkey's entrance (as, indeed, are many other Europeans), Christodoulos' statements were seen as an unwarranted intervention in foreign affairs, based on a discriminatory and racialist logic. Statements to the same effect had been made‚Äîand retracted‚Äîin the past by former Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos. The Archbishop was accused of fusing ethnic stereotypes and homophobic ideas when, on another occasion, he proclaimed that \\"Because we are not German, neither French, far more not English, but manful Greeks, we are Orthodox Christians\\".  Relations between Greece and Europe  In 1998 he declared that \\"when our ancestors gave the lights of civilization, they [Europeans] were living up in trees\\". In 2003 he said that \\"history teaches us Europeans were always out to harm us. Long before the sack of Constantinople, Hellenism had been subjected to the horrible experience of the Franks, who wanted to achieve, by any means possible, its extinction.\\" The latter sentence seems to indicate that the Archbishop extrapolates attitudes of the excommunicated Western sackers of 1204 AD, to all Western Europeans, of all times.  September 11 attacks  After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, parts of the public were shocked to hear the Archbishop attribute the attacks to \\"despondent men\\" who acted \\"out of despair caused by the injustices of the Great Powers\\". Critics attacked the ArchbishopManolis Vasilakis, \\"Kala na pathoun\\", A research on the reactions of Greek media and the public after the 9/11 attacks. for what they considered to constitute an underhanded justification of the terrorist act. Christodoulos denied the allegation and responded that he condemned the attacks. In the fifth anniversary of the attacks, in 2006, and while speaking to an audience of High School students, Christodoulos characterized the September 11, 2001 attacks \\"a hideous crime that cost the lives of thousands of innocent people\\" and attributed them to \\"man failing to discern between good and evil, and being unable to posit himself responsibly towards the problems of the world\\".  Science  In 2004, Christodoulos published a brief article in, Efimerios, the journal of the Holy Synod of the Greek Church. This does not count as an official church document but does give a rare testimony about the official position of the Holy Synod. \\"All of us have once heard that \\"god has created the world ex- nihilo.\\" This is for some people a problem. Not all are ready to accept this answer to the question, \\"how has the world been created?\\" The problem of who has created and how he has created the world is a central problem of our life. We all know the great progress that science has done in this domain. Many sciences complete each other in a common effort to discover the principles of life. We are grateful to science for its efforts to reach the limits of knowledge and throw light in all the secrets of creation. We, believers, should not fear the progress of science; on the contrary, we should expect conclusions and proposals from it which strengthen our faith. Nevertheless, we do not ignore that in the past, and precisely in the preceding century, the distrust of scripture came from certain laboratories and lasted a long time. It was the period of the myth that science is omnipotent and can give answers to the main human queries... Then, when one believes in the omnipotence of man on earth, comes accidents such as Challenger or Soviet Chernobyl to demonstrate the weakness of man... Science is a holy gift, but within limits. It stands in between physics and metaphysics. With the means of observation, experiment and mathematics, it tries to explore events that cannot be perceived. But its horizon is always limited. Nevertheless the query for atheist arguments in scientific results has not ceased even today to be a phenomenon, not of course in science laboratories, but in the imagination of some people who pretend that science has the status and authority to decide on whether God exists or not.\\"Efimerios, Oct. 2004, 10-12Blancke, S., Hjernitslev, H. and Kjaergaard, P.

Chrysopigi  In 1958 along with Kallinkos Karusos and Athanasios, Christodoulos established the religious fraternity Panagia Chrysopgigi. In 1973 via a royal edict, Christodoulos managed to lodge the fraternity of Chrysipigi on prime land just outside Athens. The edict also gave authority of the monastery, not to the local bishop, but to the Holy Synod itself.Oulis, D., Makris, G., Roussos, S. (2010). The Orthodox Church of Greece: policies and challenges under Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens (1998‚Äì2008). International Journal for the Study of the Christian Church, 10(2‚Äì3), pp. 192‚Äì210  Illness  In June 2007, Archbishop Christodoulos was hospitalised in Aretaeion Hospital of Athens and diagnosed with colonic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma in the right lobe of the liver. Following colonic tumor resection, transplantation specialist Professor Andreas Tzakis, of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, announced that the Archbishop would be transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida in order to undergo liver transplant. On 8 October 2007 the transplant was cancelled because of metastases. Following suggestions by his attending doctors, Christodoulos returned to Athens on October 26 for medical treatment.  Death and burial  People paying their last respects to Archbishop Christodoulos Christodoulos's tombstone at the First Cemetery of Athens. In his final days, the Archbishop refused to be hospitalised, preferring to remain at his home in Psychiko, where he died on 28 January 2008, one week and four days after his 69th birthday. After his death the Greek government announced a four-day national wake during which his body lay in state at the chapel of the Cathedral of the Annunciation. His funeral was held on 31 January 2008. It was presided over by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem, Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria, Patriarch Daniel of Romania, and was also attended by the Archbishop of Cyprus Chrysostomos II and the Archbishop of America Demetrios. The election of his successor was carried out by the Synod of the Metropolitans of the Church of Greece on 7 February 2008. Despite the criticism, Archbishop Christodoulos proved to be one of the most popular archbishops in Greek history, having a particular rapport with young people.

There are two definitions of roll center. The most commonly used is the geometric (or kinematic) roll center; the Society of Automotive Engineers uses a force-based definition.An Introduction to Modern Vehicle Design edited by Julian Happian- Smith P293 The location of the geometric roll center is solely dictated by the suspension geometry, and can be found using principles of the instant center of rotation. The SAE's definition of the force based roll center is, \\"The point in the transverse vertical plane through any pair of wheel centers at which lateral forces may be applied to the sprung mass without producing suspension roll\\". The lateral location of the roll center is typically at the center-line of the vehicle when the suspension on the left and right sides of the car are mirror images of each other. The significance of the roll center can only be appreciated when the vehicle's center of mass is also considered. If there is a difference between the position of the center of mass and the roll center a moment arm is created. When the vehicle experiences angular velocity due to cornering, the size of the moment arm, combined with the stiffness of the springs and anti-roll bars (anti-sway bars in some parts of the world), dictates how much the vehicle will roll. This has other effects too, such as dynamic load transfer. When we join front and rear roll centers then we get an axis about which the vehicle rolls. The roll of a vehicle also depends upon the location of the roll center from the Center of Gravity, which is also called as roll moment. Application When the vehicle rolls the roll centers migrate. It is this movement of roll centers that vehicle dynamics seek to control and in most cases limit. The rapid movement of roll centers when the system experiences small displacements can lead to stability problems with the vehicle. The roll center height has been shown to affect behavior at the initiation of turns such as nimbleness and initial roll control. Testing methods Current methods of analyzing individual wheel instant centers have yielded more intuitive results of the effects of non-rolling weight transfer effects. This type of analysis is better known as the lateral-anti method. This is where one takes the individual instant center locations of each corner of the car and then calculates the resultant vertical reaction vector due to lateral force. This value then is taken into account in the calculation of a jacking force and lateral weight transfer. This method works particularly well in circumstances where there are asymmetries in left to right suspension geometry. The practical equivalent of the above is to push laterally at the tire contact patch and measure the ratio of the change in vertical load to the horizontal force.

It is popular in Northern Ireland, and it is an iconic dish in Winnipeg, Canada. History The biscuit was originally known as the \\"Linzer biscuit\\", and later as the \\"Deutsch biscuit\\". With the outbreak of the First World War it was renamed: in England to Empire biscuit, in Scotland to Belgian biscuit because Belgium had just been invaded, but in Northern Ireland it remains known as the German biscuit or biscuit bun. In Scotland the name now varies depending on the region, with the North-east typically calling it a double shortbread and the West an Empire biscuit. In Northern Ireland it is commonly found with a jam and coconut topping. It is also known as the \\"Belgian biscuit\\", due to being topped in a similar way to a Belgian bun, which is made of pastry or dough. There also exists a biscuit similar to the Jammie Dodger which is referred to as a Linzer biscuit. Ingredients The typical Empire Biscuit has a layer of jam in between two biscuits, typically shortbread. The top is covered with white water icing, usually decorated with a glace cherry in the centre, but Dew Drops are common too. They are derived from the Austrian Linzer Torte.Edmonds Classics Hachette Livre, 2005. pg. 25 The biscuit is smaller than the Linzer Torte and does not have a cut-out section on the top.

In December 1999, it became the principal subsidiary of Marconi plc, formed by renaming the remainder of GEC when GEC's defence arm, Marconi Electronic Systems, was sold to British Aerospace to form BAE Systems. Marconi plc was restructured to Marconi Corporation plc in May 2003. Marconi Corporation used the cash raised by selling the defence arm to buy US telecoms companies, with the aim of becoming a major telecommunications systems provider. After losing most of its value in the subsequent dot-com bubble crash, and failing to win major contracts, in 2006 Ericsson acquired a majority of Marconi Corporation. The remainder of Marconi Corporation was renamed Telent. History Companies with \\"Marconi\\" in their name can trace their origins through a complex history of mergers, takeovers and divisions, to the 1963-established Marconi Company Ltd, founded in 1897 as the Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company by Guglielmo Marconi. The operations of Marconi were amalgamated into GEC in 1968, when GEC acquired the parent company of Marconi, English Electric. Background: acquisition of Plessey and GPT (1986‚Äì1997) The evolution of Marconi Communications began in 1986, when the General Electric Company (GEC) attempted a takeover of Plessey, a British-based international electronics, defence and telecommunications company founded in 1917. The takeover bid was barred by regulatory authorities. As an amicable solution, GEC and Plessey merged their telecommunications businesses on 1 April 1988 as GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT). GPT was a world leader in many fields, for example synchronous digital hierarchy technology, and this brought together the two companies responsible for developing and building the System X telephone exchange, which was supposed to make selling System X simpler. In 1989, GEC and the German conglomerate Siemens AG acquired the Plessey Company through their joint holding company, GEC Siemens plc. While most of Plessey's assets were divided between the companies (see: Plessey#Break-up of the business), GPT remained a joint venture, with a 60/40 shareholding by GEC and Siemens, respectively. GEC Plessey Telecommunications was renamed to \\"GPT\\", which would continue to exist merely as a legal entity. During the mid-1990s, the name GPT gradually disappeared in the UK. By October 1997 the joint venture, through a series of Siemens mergers and acquisitions in the UK, evolved into Siemens GEC Communication Systems, which in 1998 merged with Siemens Business Communication Systems to form the largest division of Siemens AG: Siemens Communications. Marconi (1998‚Äì2005) In August 1998, GEC acquired Siemens' 40% stake in GPT (at this point only existing as a legal entity), and merged GPT with the telecoms units of its other subsidiaries ‚Äì Marconi SpA, GEC Hong Kong, and ATC South Africa ‚Äì to form Marconi Communications. In December 1999, GEC's defence arm, Marconi Electronic Systems, was sold to British Aerospace, forming BAE Systems. The remainder of GEC was renamed Marconi, and Marconi Communications became its principal subsidiary. Marconi focused on the booming telecoms sector, and bought two American equipment- makers, RELTEC Corporation (March 1999) and FORE Systems (April 1999), to complement the businesses of Marconi Communications. Both acquisitions occurred during the peak of the dot-com bubble. The ¬£2.8bn price for FORE Systems and the ¬£1.3n spent on RELTEC took a heavy toll on Marconi following the bursting of the bubble in 2000/2001. In July 2001, Marconi suffered a 54% drop in its share price following suspension of trading of its shares, a profits warning and redundancies. On 19 May 2003, Marconi underwent a major restructuring into Marconi Corporation, advised by Lazard and Morgan Stanley; Marconi shareholders received 1 Marconi Corporation share for every 559 Marconi shares. In a debt-for-equity swap, the firm's creditors received 99.5% of the new company's shares. The company was a major supplier of asynchronous transfer mode, gigabit Ethernet, and Internet Protocol products. In 2005, it failed to secure any part of BT's 21st Century Network (21CN) programme. That Marconi received no major 21CN contract was a surprise to commentators, and sent the company's shares tumbling. An example of analysis before BT announced the winners of contracts is Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's: \\"[Marconi is] so advanced with its products and so entrenched with BT Group that its selection looks certain.\\" Various bids began to be made for the business, including one by Huawei Technologies, with whom Marconi already had a joint venture. The majority of Marconi Corporation's businesses, including Marconi Communications, were sold to Ericsson in 2005, and the remainder was renamed Telent.  Siemens Communications (1998‚Äì2006)  By 1997 the GPT name disappeared in UK, and the company was known by Siemens GEC Communication Systems (SGCS). The following year, SGCS merged with SBCS (Siemens Business Communication Systems) to form Siemens' biggest division, Siemens Information and Communication Networks division, later to be commonly known as Siemens Communications (Siemens COM). Siemens COM division was formed on 1 October 1998 as part of major restructuring and recombining of the Siemens information and communication activities. In 2002, Siemens COM was divided into two major business units: one for mobile networks and fixed networks, and the other for Enterprise business units. On 1 October 2006, Siemens AG decided to divide Siemens Communications into two companies - Siemens Networks GmbH & Co. KG, and Siemens Enterprise Communications GmbH & Co. KG. The carrier business (mobile networks, fixed networks, carrier services) became Siemens Networks GmbH & Co. KG, which later merged with Nokia to form Nokia Siemens Networks LLC. Siemens Enterprise Communications GmbH & Co. KG was demerged out of the enterprise division. Two years later, in October 2008, its operations were amalgamated into a new entity, Siemens Enterprise Communications, a joint venture formed between Siemens AG (49%) and the Gores Group (51%) to create a collaboration across wireless, fixed and enterprise networks. Operations In September 2000, Marconi announced the formation of global Technology Centers. The three Enterprise Technology Centers were based in San Jose, California; Vienna, Virginia; and Israel. The San Jose Technology Center, which had been responsible for management of Marconi's gigabit Ethernet solutions, broadened its research focus to include development of application- oriented platforms, connection-oriented uplinks between connection and connectionless networks, deep packet inspection solutions, and predictable quality of service. The center in Israel concentrated its research and development on AI-based network behavior and the Virginia center focused on AI-based network management.

Early life and education Cohon was born to a Ukrainian-Jewish father and an American-Jewish mother in Chicago, Illinois. His father worked as a lawyer and later a baker. He grew up in Chicago sharing a bedroom alongside his older sister Sandy. He received a B.Sc. from Drake University and a Juris Doctor degree from the Northwestern University School of Law. While at Northwestern, he met his future wife Susan. Career Cohen at the opening of the 600th McDonald's Canada restaurant at the SkyDome, 1989. Cohon practiced corporate law in Chicago from 1961 through 1967 at his fathers law firm before moving to Toronto, Ontario, as the licensee of McDonald's Corporation for Eastern Canada. He opened his first McDonald's location in London Ontario on November 11, 1968. On the day of the opening, McDonald's founder Ray Kroc offered to buy Cohon's licence for $1 million. He later became chairman, president and chief executive officer of McDonald's Restaurants of Canada. By 1976, Cohon presided over 200 McDonald locations. In 1982, Cohon and 20 corporate sponsors helped save the Toronto Santa Claus Parade, which was sponsored by Eaton's department stores from 1905 to 1981. He grew his McDonald franchise by himself until 1971, when McDonald's bought him out with stock. Cohon eventually became a Canadian citizen in 1975. In 1988, Cohon was appointed to sit on the board of the Royal Bank of Canada and Director of the Board of Astral Inc and Toronto Sun Publishing Corporation. He was involved in opening McDonald's in the former Soviet Union with the first restaurant opening in Moscow on January 31, 1990. He was subsequently named Russia's \\"Capitalist Hero of Labor.\\" The first restaurant was at the time McDonald's biggest, and was opened with minimal involvement from the U.S. parent company, for political reasons. It accepted only Russian rubles, not hard currency, and in the early days, the line to enter the restaurant could be several hours long. Due to Soviet supply shortages, the company created its own supply chain in the Soviet Union, including farms and packaging. At the 1991 G7 Summit in London, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney (Cohon's personal friend) personally complained to Mikhail Gorbachev about the difficulties Cohon was experiencing doing business in the Soviet Union. He is also the founder of Ronald McDonald House Charities, which provides accommodation for families whose children are receiving medical treatment, in Canada and in Russia. Awards and honours Cohon at Simon Fraser University in 2011 In 1988, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In 1998, he was awarded the Order of Friendship by the Russian government. He was awarded the Order of Ontario in 2000. In 2012, he received a key to the city of Toronto. In 2019 He was promoted within the Order of Canada to the highest grade of Companion by Governor General Julie Payette.

A joint holding company of GEC and the German conglomerate Siemens AG acquired Plessey a year later, and GPT was converted into a 60/40 GEC/Siemens joint venture. During the mid-1990s, the name GPT gradually disappeared in the UK. By October 1997, the company evolved into Siemens GEC Communication Systems (SCGS). In 1998, it was amalgamated into Siemens Communications (the largest division of Siemens, which would become part of Siemens Enterprise Communications in 2008). In August 1998, GEC acquired the 40% stake held by Siemens in GPT (by now only existing as a legal entity), and merged it into its newly founded subsidiary Marconi Communications. Through a series of mergers, divisions and restructuring in 1998/1999, GEC was renamed to Marconi plc, which was again restructured to Marconi Corporation plc in May 2003. In 2005, Marconi Corporation plc along with its subsidiary Marconi Communications, was sold to Ericsson and the remainder was renamed Telent plc. History=Plessey takeover bid and formation of GPT: 1987‚Äì1989 The evolution of GPT can be traced to 1986, when the General Electric Company (GEC) attempted a takeover of Plessey, a British-based international electronics, defence and telecommunications company founded in 1917. The takeover bid was barred by regulatory authorities. As an amicable solution, GEC and Plessey merged their telecommunications businesses (25,000 employees at the time) on 1 April 1988 as GEC Plessey Telecommunications. GPT was a world leader in many fields, for example Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) technology, and the merger brought the two companies responsible for developing and building the System X telephone exchange together, which was supposed to make selling System X simpler. GPT ‚Äì a GEC/Siemens joint venture: 1989 ‚Äì 1998 In 1989, GEC and the German conglomerate Siemens made a hostile takeover of the Plessey Company through their joint holding company, GEC Siemens plc. While most of Plessey's assets were divided between the companies, GPT remained a joint venture with a 60/40 shareholding by GEC and Siemens respectively. In 1991, because Plessey no longer existed, GEC Plessey Telecommunications was renamed to just the initial letters GPT (or GPTel in France, since in French \\"GPT\\" sounds like \\"j'ai p√©t√©\\", \\"I have broken wind\\"). Split into Marconi Communications and Siemens Communications: 1998 ‚Äì 2006 During the mid-1990s, the name GPT gradually disappeared in the UK, and by October 1997 the joint venture, through a series of Siemens mergers and acquisitions, evolved into Siemens GEC Communication Systems (SGCS), which later in 1998 merged into Siemens Business Communication Systems (SBCS) to form the largest division of Siemens AG ‚Äì Siemens Communications. In August 1998, GEC acquired Siemens' 40% stake in GPT (by now only existing as a legal entity) and merged GPT with the telecoms units of its other subsidiaries, namely Marconi SpA, GEC Hong Kong and ATC South Africa to form Marconi Communications. In December 1999, GEC's defence arm Marconi Electronic Systems was amalgamated with British Aerospace to form BAE Systems. The remaining part of GEC was renamed to Marconi plc, and Marconi Communications became its principal subsidiary. Marconi decided to focus on the then-booming telecoms sector, but acquisitions made during the dot-com bubble took a heavy toll on the company following the \\"burst of the dot-com bubble\\" in 2000/2001. On 19 May 2003, Marconi plc underwent a major restructuring into Marconi Corporation plc. In 2005, the company failed to secure any part of BT's 21st Century Network (21CN) programme, which sent the company's shares tumbling. The majority of Marconi Corporation's businesses (including Marconi Communications) were sold to Ericsson in 2005, and the remainder renamed Telent plc.

They are sometimes made with chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or advocaat filling, or with no filling at all. Preparation The yeast dough contains a good deal of eggs, milk and butter. For the classical Pfannkuchen made in Berlin the dough gets balled, deep-fried in lard, whereby the distinctive bright bulge occurs, and then filled with jam. The filling is related to the topping: for plum-butter, powdered sugar; for raspberry, strawberry and cherry jam, sugar; for all other fillings, sugar icing, sometimes flavoured with rum. Today the filling usually is injected with a large syringe or pastry bag after the dough is fried in one piece. Today, Berliners can be purchased throughout the year, though they were traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Year's Eve (Silvester) as well as the carnival holidays (Rosenmontag and Fat Tuesday). A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone.Berlin: Full of history, lifestyle and home-style cuisine at GermanFoods.org Names The terminology used to refer to this delicacy differs greatly in various areas of Germany. While called Berliner Ballen or simply Berliner in Northern and Western Germany, as well as in Switzerland, the Berliners themselves and residents of Brandenburg, Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony know them as Pfannkuchen, which literally translates to \\"pancakes\\", and in the rest of Germany generally refers to Palatschinke (also called Eierkuchen, which translates to \\"egg cakes\\"). In parts of southern and central Germany (Bavaria), as well as in much of Austria, they are a variety of Krapfen (derived from Old High German kraffo and furthermore related to Gothic language krappa), sometimes called Fastnachtskrapfen or Faschingskrapfen to distinguish them from Bauernkrapfen. In Hesse they are referred to as Kr√§ppel or Kreppel. Residents of the Palatinate call them also Kreppel or Fastnachtsk√ºchelchen (\\"little carnival cakes\\"), hence the English term for a pastry called \\"Fasnacht\\"; further south, the Swabians use the equivalent term in their distinctive dialect: Fasnetskiachla. In South Tyrol, Triveneto and other parts of Northern Italy, the food is called kraffen or krapfen, while in the southern parts it can be referred as bomba or bombolone. In Slovenia it is (Trojanski) krof; in Portugal it is \\"Bola de Berlim\\" (Berlin Ball); in Croatia it is krafni; while in Bosnia and Serbia it is called krofne. In Poland they are known as pƒÖczki, in Ukraine as \\"\\"; and in the Czech Republic as kobliha. In Hungary, it is called b√©csi f√°nk, meaning Viennese doughnut, as it was transited by Austria to the Hungarian kitchen.Meyers, June. Authentic Hungarian Heirloon Recipes Cookbook The pastry is called Berlinerbol in the Netherlands, Berlijnse bol and boule de Berlin in Belgium, hillomunkki or (glazed) berliininmunkki in Finland, berlinerbolle in Norway, Berl√≠narbollur in Iceland, ≈°i≈°ka in Slovakia, and gogo»ôi in Romania. In Denmark it is called \\"Berliner\\". In Turkey they're known as Alman Pastasƒ± (German Pie). All of these are similar preparations. International variations The Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In English- speaking countries, Berliners are a type of doughnut usually filled with jam, jelly, custard, or whipped cream. In South Australia, however, the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In Anglo- America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is \\"jelly doughnut\\". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not \\"set\\" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream. The cream or custard-filled varieties usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts.\\"Donut\\", Massachusetts Secretary of State In Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada, as well as parts of the Midwest and West in the US, such a round jelly- or custard-filled doughnut is commonly called a \\"bismark\\" or \\"bismarck\\" (after Otto von Bismarck), while a filled bar doughnut is called a \\"long john\\", and usually contains pastry cream, custard, or whipped cream, but can also contain a jelly filling. Other Canadian terms include \\"jambuster\\" in Manitoba,The History of the Jelly Doughnut at Leite's Culinaria and \\"Burlington bun\\" in Nova Scotia. Bola de Berlim from Portugal In Portugal, Berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts. They are known as bolas de Berlim (lit. Berlin ball), and the filling is frequently an egg-yolk based yellow cream called creme pasteleiro (lit. confectioner's cream). The filling is inserted after a half-length cut and is always visible. Regular sugar is used to sprinkle it. They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country. Such versions are also found in Latin American countries with German descended populations, such as in Mexico (berlinesas), Chile (Berl√≠n), Paraguay (bollo), Venezuela (bomba), Uruguay and Argentina (bola de fraile or suspiro de monja or berlinesa), where it is filled not only with custard (called \\"Crema pastelera\\"), but also with jam (especially red ones), dulce de leche, or manjar blanco. In Brazil, berliners are called sonhos (dreams) and traditionally filled with yellow custard (called simply creme). Some modern variants are filled with doce de leite, goiabada, or a mix of chocolate and doce de leite. In Israel, a version of the pastry called sufganiyah (Hebrew: ◊°◊ï◊§◊í◊†◊ô◊ô◊î) is traditionally consumed during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. Traditional sufganiyot are usually filled with jam and covered with powdered sugar. Although, many other modern variants exist as well.The 8 Best Hanukkah Sufganiyot in Israel at Haaretz.com In Finland, berliininmunkki (lit. Berlin's doughnut) is a commonly consumed pastry, although unlike a traditional Berliner, this variant has pink caramel colored frosting on top as opposed to regular or powdered sugar. John F. Kennedy urban legend John F. Kennedy's words \\"\\" are standard German for \\"I am a Berliner\\". Mentioned in Len Deighton's 1983 novel Berlin Game, an urban legend has it that due to his use of the indefinite article ', ' is translated as \\"jelly doughnut\\", and that the population of Berlin was amused by the supposed mistake. This is incorrect, insofar as when leaving out ', the meaning only changes slightly (compare I am Berliner and I am a Berliner). The normal convention when stating a nationality or, for instance, saying one is from Berlin, would be to leave out the indefinite article '. Throughout the 1980s, the lie was spread even by reputable media like The New York Times, The Guardian, BBC and NBC. However, Kennedy used the indefinite article here correctly to emphasize his relation to Berlin. Additionally, the word ' is not used in Berlin to refer to the '. These are simply called ' there and therefore no Berliner would mistake Berliner for a doughnut.

It is related to, but not the same as, indefectible, that is, \\"she remains and will remain the Institution of Salvation, founded by Christ, until the end of the world.\\" The doctrine of infallibility is premised on the authority Jesus granted to the apostles to \\"bind and loose\\" (Mat 18:18; John 20:23) and in particular the promises to Peter (Mat 16:16‚Äì20; Luke 22:32) in regard to papal infallibility. Infallibility of the ecumenical councils The doctrine of the infallibility of ecumenical councils states that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils, approved by the Pope, which concern faith or morals, and to which the whole Church must adhere, are infallible. Such decrees often have an attached anathema, a penalty of excommunication, against those who refuse to believe the teaching. The doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is infallible. The Roman Catholic Church holds this doctrine,Vatican I, Dei Filius ch. 3 ¬∂ 1, available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/v1.htm#4. Vatican II, Lumen gentium ¬ß 25 ¬∂ 2, available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/v2church.htm. 1983 Code of Canon Law 749 ¬ß 2, available at https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2H.HTM. as do most or all Eastern Orthodox theologians. However, the Orthodox churches accept only the Seven Ecumenical Councils from Nicaea I to Nicaea II as genuinely ecumenical, while Roman Catholics accept twenty-one. Only a very few Protestants believe in the infallibility of ecumenical councils, and these usually restrict infallibility to the Christological statements of the first seven councils. Lutheran Christians recognize the first four councils,See, e.g. Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commission, Seventh Meeting, The Ecumenical Councils, Common Statement, 1993, available at http://www.helsinki.fi/~risaarin/lutortjointtext.html#ecum (\\"We agree on the doctrine of God, the Holy Trinity, as formulated by the Ecumenical Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople and on the doctrine of the person of Christ as formulated by the first four Ecumenical Councils.\\"). whereas most High Church Anglicans accept all seven as persuasive but not infallible.See The Conciliar Anglican, Ask An Anglican: The Ecumenical Councils, Aug. 3, 2011, available at http://conciliaranglican.com/2011/08/03/ask-an-anglican-the-ecumenical- councils/ (\\"While it is possible for a Council to err, it is so manifestly unlikely in the event of a truly Ecumenical Council that the conclusions of such a Council should be treated as final.\\"). A popular view among Orthodox Christians, especially Greek Orthodox and churches that fall within the Ecumenical Patriarchate, is that an ecumenical council is itself infallible when pronouncing on a specific matter such as Christology,\\"The infallibility of the Church does not mean that the Church, in the assembly of the Church Fathers or in the expression of the Conscience of the Church, has already formally expressed all the truths of faith and norms. The infallibility of the Church is confined to the formulation of truths in question. This infallibility is not wholly a God-inspired energy which would affect the participants of the synod to such an extent that they would be inspired to pronounce all the truths at one time as a whole system of a Christian catechism. The Synod does not formulate a system of beliefs encompassing all Christian teachings and truths, but only endeavors to define the particular disputed truth which was misunderstood and misinterpreted. The Church of Christ and its divine nature, as set forth above, is the foundation upon which the Eastern Orthodox Church [sic.] continues to administer and nourish its faithful, thereby protecting its fundamental essentials.\\" Rev. George Mastrantonis, of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, whereas others hold that a council can be considered of full ecumenical authority only once its declarations have been embraced by the faithful, an opinion more common among the Slavic Churches, such as the Russian Orthodox. Catholic Church Catholicism teaches that Jesus Christ, \\"the Word made Flesh\\" (), is the source of divine revelation and, as the Truth, he is infallible.CCC 889 The Second Vatican Council states, \\"For this reason Jesus perfected revelation by fulfilling it through His whole work of making Himself present and manifesting Himself: through His words and deeds, His signs and wonders, but especially through His death and glorious resurrection from the dead and final sending of the Spirit of truth.\\" (Dei verbum, 4). The content of Christ's divine revelation is called the deposit of faith, and is contained in both sacred scripture and sacred tradition, not as two sources but as a single source. The magisterium (Latin: magister, \\"teacher\\") is the teaching office of the Catholic Church. Catholic theology divides the functions of the teaching office into two categories: the infallible sacred magisterium and the fallible ordinary magisterium. The infallible sacred magisterium includes the extraordinary declarations of the pope speaking ex cathedra and of ecumenical councils (traditionally expressed in conciliar creeds, canons, and decrees). Examples of infallible extraordinary papal definitions (and, hence, of teachings of the sacred magisterium) are Pope Pius IX's definition of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, and Pope Pius XII's definition of the Assumption of Mary. Before these definitions both sovereign pontiffs asked the bishops throughout the world whether these truths were indeed held by the faithful. Nowhere is it said that the Pope's charism involves special revelations, and the Pope must ascertain whether a belief is universally maintained before speaking ex cathedra on it. The above two instances of infallible definition outside an ecumenical council are the only two that can be cited in the history of the Catholic church. A document signed by then- Cardinal Ratzinger and Cardinal Bertone speaks of Notable here is the confirmation that the sensus fidelium is critical in determining whether a doctrine can be called infallible teaching. Of the ordinary magisterium, the Second Vatican Council said: \\"Bishops, teaching in communion with the Roman Pontiff, are to be respected by all as witnesses to divine and Catholic truth. In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent.\\"Lumen Gentium, 25 The ordinary magisterium includes the potentially fallible teachings of the pope and ecumenical Councils (i.e., not given ex cathedra) and, more commonly, of individual Bishops or groups of Bishops as taken separately from the whole College of Bishops. Such teachings are fallible and could possibly contain errors; they are subject to revisions or revocation. In the case of the teachings of individual bishops to their diocese, there can of course even be disagreement among the individual bishops on such issues. However, these potentially fallible teachings are necessary to contribute to the development of doctrine. Example of ordinary magisterium includes the social teachings of recent popes or theological opinions that the Popes or bishops make public. Catholics are not free to merely dismiss such teachings. The Church demands a \\"submission of the intellect and will\\" to them, even if not supernatural faith. However, this is to varying degrees depending on a variety of things, especially when teachers disagree. Catholics must respectfully hear all opinions from equal authorities and judge which is best, makes more sense, and is more consonant with the tradition of the whole history of the Church. However, the use of a higher level of authority trumps past disagreement‚Äîfor example, if a pope condemns the teaching of a bishop (even if both the condemnation and the teaching are fallible), or if an infallible teaching disagrees with a past fallible teaching. Catholics are free to weigh a variety of factors, however, in judging divergent opinions. In the end all must follow their own, well-formed conscience. Infallible teachings can be divided into two categories of precedence. The highest are called de fide credenda teachings, that is to say teachings defined as explicitly and specifically revealed in the deposit of faith: \\"Wherefore, by divine and Catholic faith all those things are to be believed which are contained in the word of God as found in Scripture and Tradition, and which are proposed by the Church as matters to be believed as divinely revealed, whether by her solemn judgment or in her ordinary and universal Magisterium.\\" (First Vatican Council, Dei Filius 8.) The other category are called de fide tenenda teachings. These are equally infallible but are proposed not as being explicitly in the deposit of faith, but nevertheless implied by it or intrinsically connected to it logically or historically. These too demand supernatural faith, but not specifically in themselves on the authority of the Word of God. Further discernment may lead to the conclusion that a de fide tenenda teaching is not merely implied by the deposit of faith, but explicitly contained and thus it may advance to de fide credenda status. Both extraordinary definitions and the universal magisterium may teach de fide credenda or de fide tenenda teachings. An example of de fide credenda teachings taught by extraordinary definition are the Christological teachings of the early ecumenical councils or the Marian dogmas of the Immaculate Conception and Assumption taught by the popes. An example of de fide credenda teachings taught by infallible ordinary and universal magisterium include the immorality of directly taking an innocent human life. Examples of de fide tenenda teachings taught by extraordinary definition include the canonizations of saints and Pope Leo XIII's declaration of Anglican orders as null and void (so-called \\"dogmatic facts\\"). Neither of these could advance to de fide credenda status as they are contingent on historical facts. However, certain teachings on grace and justification from the Council of Trent, currently regarded as infallible but only de fide tenenda due to disagreement about whether they are explicitly contained in the deposit of faith or merely logically implied, could someday advance to de fide credenda status either through extraordinary definition or through the consensus of the universal magisterium. An opinion from a former member of the Congregation For the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger holds Examples of de fide tenenda teachings taught by infallible ordinary and universal magisterium include the validity of papal elections, earlier non-papal canonizations now universally accepted (of St. Agnes, for example), or the immorality of pornography. However, none of these could advance to de fide credenda status as they are contingent on historical facts or developments, as for example pornography is condemned, and infallibly so, but is likely not included specifically in the deposit of faith (there was no such concept at the time), but is nevertheless an infallibly discerned implication of the more general revealed teachings on human sexuality and chastity. However, certain teachings taught in such a manner may someday advance to de fide credenda status, either through extraordinary definition or the consensus of the ordinary universal magisterium. As, for example, the teaching on papal infallibility was infallibly taught for a long time de fide tenenda by the universal magisterium, but not de fide credenda until the extraordinary definition at Vatican I, because there was disagreement on whether it was a specifically revealed truth from the deposit of faith or merely the logical implication of other things in the deposit of faith (as, for example, the authority of Saint Peter in the college of apostles, the constitution of the Church, her unity, her episcopal structure, etc.) Pope The doctrine of papal infallibility states that when the pope teaches ex cathedra his teachings are infallible and irreformable. Such infallible papal decrees must be made by the pope, in his role as leader of the whole Church, and they must be definitive decisions on matters of faith and morals which are binding on the whole Church. An infallible decree by a pope is often referred to as an ex cathedra statement. This type of infallibility falls under the authority of the sacred magisterium. The doctrine of papal infallibility was formally defined at the First Vatican Council in 1870, although belief in this doctrine long predated this council and was premised on the promises of Jesus to Peter, promises to Peter (Mat 16:16-20; Luke 22:32).Vatican I, Dei Filius ch. 3 ¬∂ 1 and Pastor Aeternus ch. 4 ¬∂ 5. Vatican II, Lumen gentium ¬ß 25 ¬∂ 3. 1983 Code of Canon Law 749 ¬ß 1. The encyclicals of the First Vatican Council, however were rejected by a small minority of bishops who separated themselves from union with the Bishop or Rome to form, or preserve, the Old Catholic Church. Ordinary and universal magisterium The ordinary and universal episcopal magisterium is considered infallible as it relates to a teaching concerning a matter of faith and morals that all the bishops of the Church (including the Pope) universally hold as definitive and only as such therefore needing to be accepted by all the faithful. This aspect of infallibility only applies to teachings about faith and morals as opposed to customs and prudential practices. Additionally, the ordinary and universal episcopal magisterium applies to a teaching to be held definitively by all the bishops at any given moment in history. Such teachings are extremely hard to prove. Thus, even if a teaching on a matter of faith and morals is out of favor among the bishops of a later date, once it has been held definitively by all bishops to be accepted by the faithful as infallible, then it is considered infallible and unchangeably true. However, Bishops all agreeing to a teaching to be held inconclusively are not teaching it to be definitive. It must be clearly established to be definitive for all time. This was attempted to be thoroughly done and documented in the case of several statements contained in Evangelium vitae. Eastern Orthodox Church The Eastern Orthodox Churches also believe in apostolic succession through which Christ promised to preserve the Church from teaching error. This grace and authority, however, does not make any of the bishops being individually infallible, however, but rather means that, in consensus, in combined agreement, they are charged with preserving the universal faith from error. Thus the Orthodox Church does not use the term \\"infallible\\" to discuss the works of any bishop or council. Orthodox Christians regard the concept of infallibility to be uniquely Western and therefore avoid the use of defining or terming even Ecumenical Councils as infallible. Ecumenical Councils are felt, in the East, to be a continuation of the apostolic faith, and that the apostolic faith does not change. However, it also believes that not every council that proclaims itself ecumenical is so in fact. The Orthodox would also not accept the infallibility of the ordinary and universal magisterium. Anglicanism The Church of England claimed this type of authority over the people of England, but the idea is no longer popular within the church, owing to a lack of commonly-accepted traditions and to disputes as to some peripheral doctrines. However, Anglicanism holds to a unique ecclesiology: in the Anglican view, the ancient and historic churches (such as the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental churches) that maintained apostolic succession, belief, and practice are all branches of the Universal Church. Anglicans believe there will always be a section of this tripartite church, although possibly not the Anglican Church itself, which will not fall into major heresy. Protestant Denominations A common defining belief of Protestant denominations is a rejection of the idea that any church leaders (popes, bishops, priests, or elders) are preserved from teaching error, or conversely are infallible in their interpretations of Scripture, and that believers are not therefore obligated to accept \\"infallible\\" doctrines which they, in good conscience, do not believe are supported by Scripture. Tradition and scripture Catholics, Orthodox, and some Anglicans believe that divine revelation (the one \\"Word of God\\") is contained both in the words of God in sacred scripture and in the deeds of God in sacred tradition. Everything asserted as true by either scripture or tradition is true and infallible. Yves Congar, who thought Catholics could acknowledge a substantial element of truth in sola scriptura, wrote that \\"we can admit sola scriptura in the sense of a material sufficiency of canonical Scripture. This means that Scripture contains, in one way or another, all truths necessary for salvation.\\" This has led to the tenable position of the \\"two modes\\" theory. In his book, James F. Keenan reports studies by some academics. A study by Bernard Hoose states that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death, and crime and punishment are \\"simply not true.\\" After examining seven medieval texts about homosexuality, Mark Jordan argues that, \\"far from being consistent, any attempt to make a connection among the texts proved impossible.\\" He calls the tradition's teaching of the Church \\"incoherent\\". Karl-Wilhelm Merks considers that tradition itself is \\"not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.\\" Keenan, however, says that studies of \\"manualists\\" such as John T. Noonan Jr. has demonstrated that, \\"despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co-operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition.\\" Noonan, according to Keenan, has provided a new way of viewing at \\"areas where the Church not only changed, but shamefully did not.\\" Consequences for ecumenism The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the various Protestant denominations are divided by their different views on infallibility. The ecumenical movement, which hopes to reunify all of Christianity, has found that the papacy is one of the most divisive of issues between churches. Infallibility has often been misunderstood by most Christian denominations. Infallibility cannot be understood properly unless a sound comprehension of the administration and theology of each Christian group has first been understood. For example, many Protestants and Eastern Orthodox believers have the belief that papal infallibility refers to papal impeccability (meaning that the pope cannot sin). This, however, is not the teaching of papal infallibility.Does papal infallibility mean the pope is perfect or inerrant? . Catholic Answers. Retrieved: 23 March 2013.

In his student years, Dodd was a ' and colleague of Benjamin Graham at Columbia Business School. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 (Black Tuesday) almost wiped out Graham, who had started teaching the year before at his alma mater, Columbia. The crash inspired Graham to search for a more conservative, safer way to invest. Graham agreed to teach with the stipulation that someone take notes. Dodd, then a young instructor at Columbia, volunteered. Those transcriptions served as the basis for a 1934 book Security Analysis, which galvanized the concept of value investing. It is the longest running investment text ever published.Janet Celesta Lowe, Value Investing Made Easy, McGraw-Hill (1996) Early life and education In 1916, Dodd graduated from High Street School, a high school in Martinsburg, West Virginia, where his father was the principal. In 1920, he completed his Bachelor of Science, at University of Pennsylvania. One year later, he received his Master of Science at Columbia University. Academic life From 1922 to 1925, Dodd was an instructor of economics at Columbia University. From 1925 to 1930, he became an instructor of finance. From 1926 to 1945, he was in charge of the business and economics courses. In 1930, he received his PhD from Columbia University. From 1930 to 1938, Dodd was an Assistant Professor there, from 1938 to 1947 an Associate Professor, and from 1947 to 1961 a Full Professor. From 1948 to 1952, he was Associate Dean at the Columbia Business School. In 1961, he retired as Professor Emeritus in Finance at Columbia University. On May 17, 1984, on the 50th Anniversary of publishing Security Analysis, Michael I. Sovern, President of Columbia University, awarded Dodd a Doctor of Letters, an honorary degree, for applying financial theories with brilliant results in a highly competitive world of investments. Columbia President Michael Sovern bestowed the honor during Columbia's 230th commencement exercises. Dodd was a member of the following organizations: American Economic Association, Social Science Research Council (investment committee 1950‚Äì1956), American Finance Association (Vice President 1946‚Äì1947), New York Society of Security Analysts, Beta Gamma Sigma, Phi Gamma Delta, Alpha Kappa Psi, and Phi Chi Theta. At the time of his death, various editions of the book he coauthored, Security Analysis, had sold over 250,000 copies. Professional life From 1917 to 1919, he was in the US Navy during World War I; rising from boatswain to lieutenant. From 1921 to 1922, he was Research assistant for an economist at National Bank of Commerce, New York (now part of JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; see NYS banking history here). In 1928, he advised private clients on investments. From 1950 to 1958, he was Limited partner, Newman & Graham Ltd. (an unregulated hedge fund). From 1958 to 1959, he was General partner, Graham-Newman & Co. (a regulated investment trust formed in 1929). Value investing The phrases \\"Graham and Dodd,\\" \\"value investing,\\" \\"margin of safety,\\" and \\"intrinsic value\\"‚Äîall biblical to value investors‚Äîare often used interchangeably when referring to an approach to investing. Despite the onset of modern portfolio theory (MPT) in the late 1950s‚Äîa theory that peaked throughout the 80s, gaining Nobel recognition in 1990 (co-laureates: Harry Markowitz, Merton Miller, William F. Sharpe)‚ÄîValue Investing proved to be a formidable style that sharply defied MPT. The University of Chicago was at the center of MPT (see \\"quantitative analyst\\") while Columbia has been the Mecca for Value Investing for 7¬Ω decades. Many cracks in MPT are now well established, whereas the basics behind Graham & Dodd‚Äôs approach to Value Investing are as valid today as when they were first introduced. Value Investors see securities as either priced correctly, under-priced, or over- priced. In contrast, MPT proponents insist that, by definition under the efficient-market hypothesis, a realized price of a stock is the correct price. Value investor purists reject the usefulness of capital asset pricing model (CAPM), in part, because it wrongly extrapolates historical volatility as a proxy for risk. For example, if equity prices of a company fell 75%, assuming the underlying fundamentals of the company were solid, an MPT practitioner would view it as volatile (risky); whereas, a value investor would determine whether it was undervalued, and if so, buy it, reasoning that the resulting downward risk is less than before. Therefore, value investors see MPT metrics‚Äîsuch as standard deviation, beta (relative standard deviation), alpha (excess return), and the Sharpe ratio (risk adjusted return)‚Äîas inadequate and even misleading. Columbia resisted de-emphasizing Value Investing during the throes of the MPT renaissance, but the appeal of MPT seemed to be part of a larger movement, thrusting finance aspects of business education into higher echelons of academia. During about a 25-year period (1965‚Äì90), published research and articles in leading journals of the value ilk were few. Warren Buffett once commented, \\"You couldn't advance in a finance department in this country unless you taught that the world was flat.\\"Joseph Nocera, The Heresy That Made Them Rich, The New York Times, October 29, 2005 Shortly after the death of David Dodd in 1988, Bruce Greenwald, a star professor at CBS, took a keen interest in Value Investing. He found the overwhelming success of Value investors difficult to dismiss. At the same time, reliable data that fortified Value Investing was solidifying, while MPT was showing some flaws. Professor Greenwald invigorated the academic aspects of what many in ivory towers erstwhile treated as a vocational discipline. MPT pundits argue that the Warren Buffett's long-term record is a statistical three- to five-sigma event‚Äîthat is, his success is probable, but not replicable with certainty.Buffett Partnership, Ltd., a limited investment partnership Buffett managed from 1957 to 1969, beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average every year of its existence, achieving a cumulative return of 2,749.9% relative to the DJIA's 152.6%. Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a onetime beleaguered textile company that Buffett acquired in 1965 and transformed into an investment vehicle, beat the pre-tax total return of the S&P; 500 in 36 of 41 years, achieving an after-tax cumulative return of 305,134% relative to the S&P; 500's pre-tax total return (with reinvested dividends) of 5,583%. Nobel Laureate William F. Sharpe dismissed Buffett's success as a three sigma event‚Äîa statistical aberration absurdly out of line. Yet the success of numerous other investment funds and practitioners who applied value investing theories weakened assertions attributing success to chance. Because Value Investing rejects MPT and its use of sophisticated statistics, there's irony when MPT theorists attribute its success to tails of standard deviation. Bruce Greenwald overhauled and relaunched the Value Investing curriculum at Columbia in the spring of 1994. Today, Value Investing enjoys broad appeal among academicians and investors around the world. Professor Greenwald is the Robert Heilbrunn Professor of Finance and Asset Management at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business. Personal life Dodd's residence (1950s - 60s): 39 Claremont Avenue (down the street from Juilliard's former home), Morningside Heights (2006 photo) On August 9, 1924, he married Elsie Marguerite Firor (b. Mar 22, 1898 ‚Äî d. 22 June 2001). David Dodd died September 18, 1988, aged 93, of respiratory failure at Maine Medical Center, Portland, Maine. His daughter, Barbara Dodd Anderson (1932‚Äì2010) lived in Northern California and was a benefactor of the Heilbrunn Center for Graham and Dodd Investing.

Their territory today is confined to the Tsuu T ºina Nation 145 reserve, whose east side is adjacent to the southwest city limits of Calgary. Their traditional territory is located in the part of North America now occupied by the United States. The land area of the current reserve is 283.14 km2 (109.32 sq mi), and it had a population of 1,982 in the Canada 2001 Census. The northeast portion of the reserve was used as part of CFB Calgary, a Canadian Army base, from 1910 to 1998. In 2006, the land was returned to the Nation by the Government of Canada. The Tsuut ºina people were formerly called the Sarsi or Sarcee, words which are believed to have been derived from a Blackfoot word meaning \\"stubborn ones\\". The two peoples long had conflict over territory because Sarcee is on traditional Blackfoot land. Because of its origins from an enemy, the term is now viewed as offensive by most of the Tsuut ºina. History The Tsuut ºina are an Athapaskan group, once part of the more northerly Dane-zaa ('Beaver Indians') nation, who migrated south onto the Great Plains during the 1700s, prior to any written records of the area. Tsuut ºina oral history has preserved the memory of their separation from the Dane-zaa.Report on the Sarcee Indians by the Rev. E. F. Wilson ‚Äì as published in the Report of the Fifty-Eighth Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, p. 243Indian Legends of Canada by Ella Elizabeth Clark, p. 92 Explorer David Thompson said that the Tsuut ºina lived in the Beaver Hills near present-day Edmonton during the 1810s, where they cohabited with the Cree. At some point, however, they came into conflict with the Cree and moved further to the south, eventually forming an alliance with the Blackfoot. The Tsuut ºina likely acquired most of their Plains Indian culture from the Blackfoot. Although in most respects the Tsuut ºina are typical Northern Plains Indians, their Tsuut ºina language is an Athabaskan language, closely related to the languages of the Dene groups of northern Canada and Alaska, and also to those of the Navajo and Apache peoples of the American Southwest, rather than the geographically nearer Blackfoot language and the Cree language, which are Algonquian languages.  21st century  In 2007, the Tsuut ºina opened the Grey Eagle Casino just outside Calgary city limits. The Grey Eagle complex began a major expansion, including construction of a hotel, in 2012. Both the initial construction of the casino and the expansion have been accompanied by concerns among city residents about traffic tie-ups in the area of the casino. Beginning in the late 2000s, the proximity of the Nation's territory to the city of Calgary led to disagreement over Alberta's plans to construct the southwest portion of Highway 201, a ring road. The planned freeway, expected to be completed by 2024, will nearly encircle the City of Calgary. The southwest portion was planned to pass through Tsuut ºina land to avoid environmentally sensitive areas. A 2009 referendum by the Nation rejected a plan to transfer reserve land to the Province of Alberta to permit construction of the southwest portion of the ring road. Some members of the Nation were upset by the rejection of the land transfer,http://www.transportation.alberta.ca/Content/docType490/Production/CSWRR/Communities_workshop_1.pdf while others viewed it as a triumph both environmentally and for the Nation. A subsequent referendum held by the Nation in 2013 approved the land transfer for the ring road, the Tsuu T ºina portion of which was named Tsuut ºina Trail, even though it caused the forced removal of some residents from their traditional land by the Chief and Council. The construction resulted in the destruction of 428 hectares of traditional land including recently protected wetlands. On August 28, 2020, Costco opened a store at 12905 Buffalo Run Blvd, in the Shops at Buffalo Run development created by the Nation's development project, Taza.

Construction was begun in 1849 and completed in 1854. The gaugeConfederate Railroads - South Side railroad connected City Point, a port on the James River with the farm country south and west of Petersburg, Virginia, to Lynchburg, Virginia, a distance of about . High Bridge near Farmville, Virginia in the 1850s The Southside Railroad was important to the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Ravaged by the war, it was rebuilt and later became an important part of Norfolk and Western and Norfolk Southern's coal route from the mountains to port at Hampton Roads. In addition to coal, most of the route is in active use in the 20th century for intermodal container and automobile parts and completed vehicle shipments.  Charter, construction, City Point Railroad  The charter for the new Southside Railroad was issued by the State of Virginia in 1846 with 1 million dollars of capital. The State of Virginia gave all of its stock in the Petersburg Railroad to the City of Petersburg for the construction of the Southside Railroad. The stock was given on the condition that construction must start in three years or the stock would revert to the State. The new board of directors began directing the extending of the line to Lynchburg to make a junction with the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The board purchased four and a half thousand tonnes of iron from England to be paid with cash and delivered by ship to City Point. They also purchased 20,000 sills, railroad ties, made of trees which resisted rot, Juniper, American chestnut and Post Oak to be delivered to the wharf. The board purchased land to build a depot. They hired an engineering team with one chief engineer, six assistant engineers and 17 enslaved Africans. To grade and build the whole line, they hired 16 contractors, each outfitted with a wagon, carts, teams of horses and the employ of almost 800 laborers in total. The city of Petersburg put forward over $400,000 and 44 investors invested $14,000. The City of Farmville bought a subscription of $100,000. Individual investors bought $150,000 dollars worth of stock. The company could begin grading and building the railroad to Lynchburg. Construction began from the eastern end in 1849, reaching Burkeville and a connection with the Richmond and Danville Railroad in 1852. (The latter was still also building east-to- west, but had been completed east to Richmond.) Following a more circuitous route through Farmville in response to financial incentives from the community, the railroad constructed the famous 21 span High Bridge across the Appomattox River valley about east of Farmville. The structure was long and as high as in the center, one of the largest in the world when built. The Southside Railroad was completed to Percival Island across the James River from Lynchburg in 1854. Also in 1854, the Southside Railroad acquired the long City Point Railroad. It had been purchased by the City of Petersburg in 1847, and renamed Appomattox Railroad. Paralleling the Appomattox River from Petersburg to its confluence with the James River at City Point, the City Point Railroad provided an ideal link for the Southside Railroad to reach a deep water steamship connection on the navigable portion of the larger river.

Beyond the lines of battle until the war's last year, the principal damage it suffered was the financial weakness caused by Confederate compensation policies and currency. The Confederate States Army destroyed most of the rail around Petersburg. Half of the eight mile City Point Railroad, was completely removed and another two miles was beyond repair. Only two and a half miles from Petersburg was the track even salvageable. The United States Army rebuilt it. Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant requested a railroad to help with supplies for the Siege of Petersburg, knowing from past experience that it would be needed. Grant empowered Mr. C. L. McAlpine, engineer of construction and repairs, to rebuild the City Point to Petersburg Railroad, as soon as the fighting moved elsewhere. McAlpine commenced operations when he arrived on June 18, 1864. The City Point Railroad portion of the Southside Railroad was of great value to the Union forces during the Siege of Petersburg in 1864-65. General Grant used and extended it to move supplies and troops from the port at City Point to the area south and east of Petersburg, operating it as a U.S. Military Railroad. In the last year of the Civil War, the U.S. Government rebuilt ten miles of tracks, a hospital and a bakery on the Southside Railroad and rebuilt trestle bridges.

Merger into the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio Railroad After the War, the stockholders of the Southside Railroad elected former Major General (CSA) William Mahone, chief engineer on the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad, as president of their road. He had some fame from his part in the Battle of the Crater. In the post-war years, William Mahone became the driving force in the linkage of N&P;, Southside Railroad and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. He was president of all three by the end of 1867. Mahone wanted to combine them into a single entity and expand westward. He lobbied the Virginia General Assembly to gain the legislation necessary to form the Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad (AM&O;), a new line composed of the 3 railroads he headed, extending 408 miles from Norfolk to Bristol, Virginia in 1870. The former Southside Railroad formed one of three original A,M & O divisions.  Southside Railroad today  The former Southside Railroad formed a major piece of the Norfolk and Western used to transport bituminous coal from the mines in southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia to port at Norfolk, where a huge coal pier was built at Lambert's Point. Over 150 years after completion, much of the former Southside Railroad route remained in active use until 2005, when the corridor was abandoned and subsequently turned over to the Virginia DCR (Dept of Conservation and Recreation) for conversion to a rail trail linear park called High Bridge Trail State Park. Construction on the High Bridge began March 7, 2011 and the bridge was officially opened to the public April 5, 2012. The bridge itself was rehabilitated via a federal grant of 2 million dollars. It is the namesake of the park. The trail is a total of 31 miles long and runs from Burkeville to Pamplin City. Both ends terminate just before their destinations, however the park service is currently working with the railroad to acquire the end caps to complete the trail.

Reveen (8 October 1935 ‚Äì 8 April 2013) was an Australian illusionist and hypnotist who performed mainly in Canada, and particularly Atlantic Canada. Early life Reveen was born in Adelaide, Australia, and traveled to the US in January 1961, landing in Honolulu, Hawaii. From there, he took an unpleasant boat ride to San Francisco, California and purchased a Greyhound Bus ticket to Vancouver, British Columbia. As both Canada and Australia are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, Reveen was granted a six-month visitor's visa on 16 March 1961. Career Reveen began his career in the town of Chilliwack, BC, booking himself into local community halls and legions, calling himself Reveen, the Impossibilist. To promote his shows, Reveen offered complimentary tickets to all businesses willing to put a poster in their storefront window. In many towns, he also offered local radio stations a percentage of ticket sales in exchange for advertising. In 1962, The Man They Call Reveen was given the opportunity to perform in a movie house and his career took off. He toured extensively through Canada and the United States for 35 years, eventually performing for over 6,000,000 people. In September 2007, Reveen came out of retirement with a mini-tour of Atlantic Canada called The Return of Reveen. Reveen was one of the founding members of the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, California, and in 1987 wrote the book The Superconscious World. In 2000, he won the DRAGON Award, an annual award given to magicians who excel in Drama, Romance, Artistry, Glamour, Originality and Necromancy.List of Dragon Award Winners After Peter's death from diabetes and dementiaPeter Reveen, stage illusionist, dead at 77 in 2013, his son, Tyrone, continued on with the \\"Reveen\\" show. Personal life Reveen was married to Coral Reveen and had 4 sons (oldest to youngest): Wayne Reveen, Tyrone Reveen, Calvin Reveen, and Peter Reveen Jr. Peter Jr. is best known as the former guitar player in the now defunct American hard rock band Salty Dog. Cultural references Samples from his self-hypnosis LPs, including Relax with Reveen, Study and Concentrate with Reveen, and Stop Smoking...Stop Overeating with Reveen, feature on some modern Electronic music, such as the Lemon Jelly track Nervous Tension, and Bonobo track Shadowtricks. Trailer Park Boys' character Ricky is occasionally called \\"Reveen\\", much to Ricky's displeasure, due to their vague physical resemblance. Reveen appears to be the basis for a Saturday Night Live parody commercial about a hypnotist who gets audience members exiting the theatre to robotically drone \\"It was much better than CATS, I would see it again and again.\\" to a reporter. In an episode of the Canadian sketch comedy program The Holmes Show, there is a sketch featuring Roman Danylo as a stage hypnotist named \\"Crevasse the Impossiblist\\". A crevasse is similar to a ravine, and is a pun on the name \\"Reveen\\". During his May 2009 Late Show with David Letterman appearance, comedian Norm Macdonald revealed he went to one of Reveen's shows as a teenager. Notable honours In December 2009, IBM Ring 257 named Reveen their 2009 Magician of the Year.

Under balanced trade, nations are required to provide a fairly even reciprocal trade pattern; they cannot run large trade deficits or trade surpluses. The concept of balanced trade arises from an essay by Michael McKeever Sr. of the McKeever Institute of Economic Policy Analysis. According to the essay, \\"BT is a simple concept which says that a country should import only as much as it exports so that trade and money flows are balanced. A country can balance its trade either on a trading partner basis in which total money flows between two countries are equalized or it can balance the overall trade and money flows so that a trade deficit with one country is balanced by a trade surplus with another country.\\"  Implementation  Balanced trade, as a concept, was suggested by Warren Buffett in a November 2003 Fortune Magazine article. Therein he proposed a system of \\"Import Certificates\\" (ICs) ‚Äì exporters would receive $1 of ICs for each $1 of goods they exported, and importers would be required to present $1 of ICs for every $1 of goods they import. This would limit the value of imports to at most the value of exports (and presumably exactly the value of imports, assuming no leakage), and create a market of exporters to sell ICs to importers, effectively subsidizing exporters and taxing importers ‚Äì compare cap and trade. A year before Buffett's article, a form of balanced trade was hinted at by William Hawkins, who advocated direct limitations on imports: \\"the Bush Administration should be taking direct measures to reduce the trade deficit ‚Äì which means limiting imports, both to defend the dollar's integrity and America's economic strength.\\" In the United States, the idea was introduced legislatively in the Balanced Trade Restoration Act of 2006. The proposed legislation was sponsored by US Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Russell Feingold (D-WI). A more extensive argument for balanced trade, and a program to achieve balanced trade is presented by Raymond Richman, Howard Richman and Jesse Richman. In their 2008 book Trading Away Our Future, they argue \\"A minimum standard for ensuring that trade does benefit all is that trade should be relatively in balance.\\" The Richmans published another book in 2014, Balanced Trade: Ending the Unbearable Costs of America's Trade Deficits, in which they propose a \\"scaled tariff‚Ä¶be applied to all imported goods from trade surplus countries that have had a sizable trade surplus with the United States over the most recent four economic quarters. The tariff rate would be designed to take in a portion (e.g. 50%) of the bilateral trade deficit (goods plus services) as revenue.\\" Another advocate of balanced trade is Kenneth Davis Jr, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce and former Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for IBM Inc. In 2014 Davis and Will Wilkin formed Balanced Trade Associates to advocate for a balanced trade policy in the United States. They drafted model legislation, the Balanced Trade Restoration Act of 2014, that would use an electronic form of Import certificates to taper down imports 10% each year for 3 years, then, beginning in the 4th year, limit imports each year to the same value as the previous year's exports. The goal of balanced trade is also advanced by Mike Stumo, CEO of the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA). CPA has initiated a petition requesting that \\"Congress adopt balanced trade as the primary national trade goal by adding the following language to future trade-related bills: 'The principal national objective for trade in goods, services and agriculture is to achieve an overall balance of payments over a reasonable period of time, eliminate persistent trade deficits and reverse the accumulation of foreign debt.'\\" See also *Fair trade *Unequal exchange References Category:International trade theory ","title":"Balanced trade"},{"id":"1510542","text":"Hal Willner (April 6, 1956 ‚Äì April 7, 2020) was an American music producer working in recording, films, TV and live events. He was best known for assembling tribute albums and events featuring a wide variety of artists and musical styles (jazz, classical, rock, Tin Pan Alley). He died during the COVID-19 pandemic due to complications brought on by COVID-19. Early life Willner was born in Philadelphia in 1956. His father and uncle were Holocaust survivors. Willner moved to New York City in 1974 to attend New York University, but did not graduate. Career In the late 1970s, Willner worked under record producer Joel Dorn, credited as associate producer on Leon Redbone's albums Double Time and Champagne Charlie, and The Neville Brothers' Fiyo on the Bayou. Willner became the sketch music producer of Saturday Night Live in 1980, where he chose the music to be used in sketches for four decades. From 1988 to 1990 he produced the TV program Sunday Night (later renamed Night Music), which was hosted by David Sanborn and presented musicians from a wide variety of genres. Willner produced albums for Marianne Faithfull, Lou Reed, Bill Frisell, Steven Bernstein, William S. Burroughs, Gavin Friday, Lucinda Williams, Laurie Anderson and Allen Ginsberg, among others. He produced a live tribute concert to Tim Buckley, that ultimately launched the career of Tim's son Jeff. He released one album under his own name: Whoops, I'm an Indian, which featured audio samples from 78 rpm records from the early-mid 20th century. Following earlier stagings, in January 2010 Willner produced his pirate-themed concert event Rogue's Gallery for the Sydney Festival. The multinational cast included Marianne Faithfull, Todd Rundgren, Tim Robbins, Gavin Friday, Peter Garrett, Baby Gramps, David Thomas, Sarah Blasko, Katy Steele, Peaches, Glenn Richards, Liam Finn, Camille O'Sullivan, Kami Thompson and Marry Waterson. Personal life At the time of his death he was married to television producer Sheila Rogers, and they had one son Arlo. Death Willner had symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

The KC-135 was completely destroyed when its fuel load ignited, killing all four crew members. The B-52G broke apart, killing three of the seven crew members aboard. Of the four Mk28-type hydrogen bombs the B-52G carried, three were found on land near the small fishing village of Palomares in the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora, Almer√≠a, Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact with the ground, resulting in the contamination of a area by plutonium. The fourth, which fell into the Mediterranean Sea, was recovered intact after a search. Accident Operation Chrome Dome flight route over southern Europe, showing refueling tracks The B-52G began its mission from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, carrying four type B28RI hydrogen bombs on a Cold War airborne alert mission named Operation Chrome Dome. The flight plan took the aircraft east across the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea towards the European borders of the Soviet Union before returning home. The lengthy flight required two mid-air refuelings over Spain. At about 10:30 am on 17 January 1966, while flying at , the bomber commenced its second aerial refueling with a KC-135 out of Mor√≥n Air Base in southern Spain. The B-52 pilot, Major Larry G. Messinger, later recalled, Boom operator's view of a B-52 from a KC-135 tanker The planes collided, with the nozzle of the refueling boom striking the top of the B-52 fuselage, breaking a longeron and snapping off the left wing, which resulted in an explosion that was witnessed by a second B-52 about a mile away. All four men on the KC-135 and three of the seven men on the bomber were killed. Those killed in the tanker were boom operator Master sergeant Lloyd Potolicchio, pilot Major Emil J. Chapla, copilot Captain Paul R. Lane, and navigator Captain Leo E. Simmons. On board the bomber, navigator First Lieutenant Steven G. Montanus, electronic warfare officer First Lieutenant George J. Glessner, and gunner Technical Sergeant Ronald P. Snyder were killed. Montanus was seated on the lower deck of the main cockpit and was able to eject from the plane, but his parachute never opened. Glessner and Snyder were on the upper deck, near the point where the refueling boom struck the fuselage, and were not able to eject. Four of the seven crew members of the bomber managed to parachute to safety: in addition to pilot Major Messinger, aircraft commander Captain Charles F. Wendorf, copilot First Lieutenant Michael J. Rooney and radar-navigator Captain Ivens Buchanan. Buchanan received burns from the explosion and was unable to separate himself from his ejection seat, but he was nevertheless able to open his parachute, and he survived the impact with the ground. The other three surviving crew members landed safely several miles out to sea. The Palomares residents carried Buchanan to a local clinic, while Wendorf and Rooney were picked up at sea by the fishing boat Dorita. The last to be rescued was Messinger, who spent 45 minutes in the water before he was brought aboard the fishing boat Agustin y Rosa by Francisco Sim√≥ Orts. All three men who landed in the sea were taken to a hospital in √Åguilas. Weapons recovery The aircraft and hydrogen bombs fell to earth near the fishing village of Palomares. This settlement is part of Cuevas del Almanzora municipality, in the Almeria province, Spain. Three of the weapons were located on land within 24 hours of the accident‚Äîthe conventional explosives in two had exploded on impact, spreading radioactive contamination, while a third was found relatively intact in a riverbed. The fourth weapon could not be found despite an intensive search of the area‚Äîthe only part that was recovered was the parachute tail plate, leading searchers to postulate that the weapon's parachute had deployed, and that the wind had carried it out to sea.USAF Nuclear Safety, 1966. During early stages of recovery after the accident the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, flying RF-101C Voodoos out of RAF Upper Heyford near Oxford, England, provided aerial photographs to assist in the recovery operation and to document the crash site. On 22 January, the Air Force contacted the U.S. Navy for assistance. The Navy convened a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), chaired by Rear Admiral L. V. Swanson with Dr. John P. Craven and Captain Willard Franklyn Searle, to identify resources and skilled personnel that needed to be moved to Spain. The search for the fourth bomb was carried out by means of a novel mathematical method, Bayesian search theory, led by Dr. Craven. This method assigns probabilities to individual map grid squares, then updates these as the search progresses. Initial probability input is required for the grid squares, and these probabilities made use of the fact that a local fisherman, Francisco Sim√≥ Orts, popularly known since then as (\\"Bomb Paco\\" or \\"Bomb Frankie\\"), witnessed the bomb entering the water at a certain location. Sim√≥ Orts was hired by the U.S. Air Force to assist in the search operation. The United States Navy assembled the following ships in response to Air Force request for assistance:Melson, June 1967, pp. 26‚Äì39. Alvin submersible * , a Navajo class fleet tug, arrived 27 January, first on- scene * , flagship through January * * , found UQS-1 SONAR contact where Francisco Simo-Orts saw the bomb fall * , mother ship for PC3B submersible * , confirmed Pinnacles SONAR contact  * , served as a support ship for the submersibles * , flagship 30 January ‚Äì 15 March * , flagship 15 March through April * , transported Aluminaut and Alvin to the search site  * * , transported Aluminaut to Miami, Florida, after Palomares incident  DSV Alvin * Aluminaut * PC-3B (Ocean Systems, Inc. submersible capable of searching to ) * Deep Jeep (a Navy submersible capable of diving to ) * CURV-I (Cable-Controlled Underwater Recovery Vehicle) * , removed aircraft wreck debris from the search site * , removed aircraft wreck debris from the search site * , removed radioactive contaminated soil from Spain. Additionally, the aircraft carrier and various other units of the Sixth Fleet made a brief stopover at Palomares on the morning of 15 March 1966, with Forrestal anchoring at 09:03 and departing at 12:19.NAVPERS-719 DECK LOG ‚Äì REMARKS SHEET USS Forrestal CVA-59 dated Tuesday, 15 March 1966, 08‚Äì12 watch and 12‚Äì16 watch, and obtained from the National Archives and Records Administration in July 2015. The recovery operation was led by Supervisor of Salvage, Capt Searle. Hoist, Petrel and Tringa brought 150 qualified divers who searched to with compressed air, to with mixed gas, and to with hard-hat rigs;Melson, June 1967, p. 37. but the bomb lay in an uncharted area of the Rio Almanzora canyon on a 70-degree slope at a depth of . After a search that continued for 80 days following the crash, the bomb was located by the DSV Alvin on 17 March, but was dropped and temporarily lost when the Navy attempted to bring it to the surface.Melson, June 1967, pp. 38‚Äì39. After the loss of the recovered bomb the ship's positions were fixed by Decca HI-FIX position-locating equipment for subsequent recovery attempts. The recovered hydrogen bomb displayed on the fantail of the submarine rescue ship after it was located by DSV Alvin and recovered by CURV-I, pictured, at a depth of Alvin located the bomb again on 2 April, this time at a depth of . On 7 April, an unmanned torpedo recovery vehicle, CURV-I, became entangled in the weapon's parachute while attempting to attach a line to it. A decision was made to raise CURV and the weapon together to a depth of , where divers attached cables to them. The bomb was brought to the surface by . The was diverted from its Naples destination and stayed on scene until recovery and took the bomb back to the United States. Once the bomb was located, Sim√≥ Orts appeared at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with his lawyer, Herbert Brownell, formerly Attorney General of the United States under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, claiming salvage rights on the recovered hydrogen bomb. According to Craven: The Air Force settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. In later years, Sim√≥ was heard to complain that the Americans had promised him financial compensation and had not kept that promise. Contamination At 10:40 UTC, the accident was reported at the Command Post of the Sixteenth Air Force, and it was confirmed at 11:22. The commander of the U.S. Air Force at Torrej√≥n Air Base, Spain, Major General Delmar E. Wilson, immediately traveled to the scene of the accident with a Disaster Control Team. Further Air Force personnel were dispatched later the same day, including nuclear experts from U.S. government laboratories. The first weapon to be discovered was found nearly intact. However, the conventional explosives from the other two bombs that fell on land detonated without setting off a nuclear explosion (akin to a dirty bomb explosion). This ignited the pyrophoric plutonium, producing a cloud that was dispersed by a wind. A total of 260 ha () was contaminated with radioactive material. This included residential areas, farmland (especially tomato farms) and woods. To defuse alarm of contamination, on 8 March the Spanish minister for information and tourism Manuel Fraga Iribarne and the United States ambassador Angier Biddle Duke swam on nearby beaches in front of press. First the ambassador and some companions swam at Moj√°car ‚Äî a resort away ‚Äî and then Duke and Fraga swam at the Quitapellejos beach in Palomares.Un ba√±o y un Meyba que pasaron a la historia El Almer√≠a, 17 January 2012 Despite the cost and number of personnel involved in the cleanup, forty years later there remained traces of the contamination. Snails have been observed with unusual levels of radioactivity. Additional tracts of land have also been appropriated for testing and further cleanup. However, no indication of health issues has been discovered among the local population in Palomares. Political consequences President Lyndon B. Johnson was first apprised of the situation in his morning briefing the same day as the accident. He was told that the 16th Nuclear Disaster Team had been sent to investigate, per the standard procedures for this type of accident. News stories related to the crash began to appear the following day, and it achieved front page status in both the New York Times and Washington Post on 20 January. Reporters sent to the accident scene covered angry demonstrations by the local residents. On 4 February, an underground Communist organization successfully initiated a protest by 600 people in front of the U.S. Embassy in Spain. The Duchess of Medina Sidonia, Luisa Isabel √Ålvarez de Toledo (known as the \\"Red Duchess\\" for her socialist activism), eventually received a 13-month prison sentence for leading an illegal protest. Four days after the accident, the Spanish government under Franco's dictatorship stated that \\"the Palomares incident was evidence of the dangers created by NATO's use of the Gibraltar airstrip\\", announcing that NATO aircraft would no longer be permitted to fly over Spanish territory either to or from Gibraltar. On 25 January, as a diplomatic concession, the U.S. announced that it would no longer fly over Spain with nuclear weapons, and on 29 January the Spanish government formally banned U.S. flights over its territory that carried such weapons. This caused other nations hosting U.S. forces to review their policies, with the Philippine Foreign Secretary Narciso Ramos calling for a new treaty to restrict the operation of U.S. military aircraft in Filipino airspace. Palomares, and the Thule Air Base B-52 crash involving nuclear weapons two years later in Greenland, made Operation Chrome Dome politically untenable, leading the U.S. Department of Defense to announce that it would be \\"re-examining the military need\\" for continuing the program. As of 2008, there was no museum or monument dedicated to the accident in Palomares, and was noted only by a short street named \\"17 January 1966\\". Cleanup Soil with radioactive contamination levels above 1.2 MBq/m2 was placed in 250-litre (66 U.S. gallon) drums and shipped to the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina for burial. A total of was decontaminated by this technique, producing 6,000 barrels. of land with lower levels of contamination were mixed to a depth of by harrowing and plowing. On rocky slopes with contamination above 120 kBq/m2, the soil was removed with hand tools and shipped to the U.S. in barrels. Barrels of contaminated soil being prepared for removal to the United States for processing In 2004, a study revealed that there was still some significant contamination present in certain areas, and the Spanish government subsequently expropriated some plots of land which would otherwise have been slated for agriculture use or housing construction.M√©ndez, Rafael (10 December 2010). \\"Palomares: 50.000 metros contaminados con plutonio\\".

En un informe preliminar, de junio de 2007, el Ciemat admiti√≥ que hab√≠a contaminaci√≥n fuera de las zonas valladas y expropiadas y el CSN replic√≥ que la contaminaci√≥n detectada se podr√≠a superar la dosis de radiaci√≥n admisible para el p√∫blico, lo que oblig√≥ a \\"imponer restricciones totales o parciales\\" al uso del suelo. On 11 October 2006, Reuters reported that higher than normal levels of radiation were detected in snails and other wildlife in the region, indicating there may still be dangerous amounts of radioactive material underground. The discovery occurred during an investigation being carried out by Spain's energy research agency CIEMAT and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. and Spain agreed to share the cost of the initial investigation. In April 2008, CIEMAT announced they had found two trenches, totaling , where the U.S. Army stored contaminated earth during the 1966 operations. The American government agreed in 2004 to pay for the decontamination of the grounds, and the cost of the removal and transportation of the contaminated earth has been estimated at $2 million. The trenches were found near the cemetery, where one of the nuclear devices was retrieved in 1966, and they were probably dug at the last moment by American troops before leaving Palomares. CIEMAT informed they expected to find remains of plutonium and americium once an exhaustive analysis of the earth had been carried out. In a conversation in December 2009, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel √Ångel Moratinos told the U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he feared Spanish public opinion might turn against the U.S. once the results of the study on nuclear contamination were to be revealed. In August 2010, a Spanish government source revealed that the U.S. had stopped the annual payments it has made to Spain, as the bilateral agreement in force since the accident had expired the previous year. On 19 October 2015, Spain and the United States signed an agreement to further discuss the cleanup and removal of land contaminated with radioactivity. Under a statement of intent signed by Spanish Foreign Minister Jos√© Manuel Garc√≠a-Margallo and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the two countries will negotiate a binding agreement to further restore and clear up the Palomares site and arrange for the disposal of the contaminated soil at an appropriate site in the U.S. As of June 2020 such agreement signed in October 2015 has not materialised in a binding agreement that should facilitate a definitive cleanup and removal of contaminated soil. Aftermath The casings of two B28 nuclear bombs involved in the Palomares incident are on display at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The empty casings of two of the bombs involved in this incident are now on display in the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History in Albuquerque, New Mexico. While serving on the salvage ship during recovery operations, Navy diver Carl Brashear had his leg crushed in a deck accident and lost the lower part of his left leg. His story was the inspiration for the 2000 film Men of Honor. In March 2009, Time magazine identified the Palomares accident as one of the world's \\"worst nuclear disasters\\". There has been a marked long-term occurrence of cancer and other health defects among the surviving USAF personnel who were directed to the site in the days following the accident to clean up the contamination. Most of the afflicted personnel have had difficulty securing any type of compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs due to the secretive nature of the cleanup operation and the Air Force's refusal to acknowledge that adequate safety measures to protect the first responders may not have been taken. In June 2016, The New York Times published an article on the 50th anniversary lingering legacy of the Palomares accident. In December 2017, one of the airmen involved in the clean-up, Victor Skaar, sued the Department of Veterans Affairs in the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Skaar was appealing the Department's refusal of medical treatment for leukopenia that Skaar believes was caused by his exposure at Palomares. He also petitioned for the Court to certify a class of veterans \\"who were present at the 1966 cleanup of plutonium dust at Palomares, Spain[,] and whose application for service-connected disability comp based on exposure to ionizing radiation [VA] has denied ore will deny.\\" The certification of this class was granted by the Court in December 2019. This one of the first cases ever granted class-action status by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Popular culture references The incident inspired the light-hearted 1966 film Finders Keepers, starring Cliff Richard backed by his band The Shadows. This incident was given the movie treatment in a semi-serious 1967 film, The Day the Fish Came Out, which covers the story of a plane crash alongside a Greek (not Spanish) Island and the surreptitious attempts by plainclothes U.S. Navy personnel to find the missing bombs. In November 1966, the plot of an episode of the espionage-themed American television series I Spy entitled \\"One of Our Bombs is Missing\\" was devoted to the search for an American Air Force plane carrying an atomic weapon which crashed over a remote Italian village. In Episode 12 of the fourth season of Archer, the main protagonists race against time to recover a lost hydrogen bomb near the Bermuda Triangle, with references being made to how the U.S. Air Force settled for \\"at least $20 million\\" when they lost a previous hydrogen bomb in the late 1960s. In 2000, the U.S. film Men of Honor focused on the life of the first black American master diver in the U.S. Navy. The film begins and ends with the Palomares bomb recovery by U.S. Navy personnel. In April 2015, the Palomares incident was mentioned in the Danish film The Idealist, a film about a similar incident, the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. In August 2015, the Palomares incident was the subject of a 2-minute animated film, made by Richard Neale, that was a finalist in the BBC's WellDoneU competition for amateur film makers.

It is the highest point between Black Combe and Harter Fell on the broad ridge to the west of the Duddon Valley. Views from the summit include the full length of the Duddon Valley including its estuary; the western side of the Coniston fells; the Eskdale fells including Scafell and Bowfell; much of western Cumbria including the estuary of the Rivers Esk, Mite and Irt; the Isle of Man; as well as the hills to the south culminating in Black Combe. The hill is relatively infrequently visited, and is a fairly characterless grassy mound, extensively grazed by sheep, though with a very large cairn, whose stones may be from a tumulus. A bridleway crosses the fell to the north of the summit, but it is probably more frequently visited on a round including Burn Moor at , Kinmont Buck Barrow at , and Buck Barrow at from the summit of the Corney Fell road, a route described by Alfred Wainwright in the \\"Whit Fell\\" chapter of his book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.

The result is placed on a smooth, wet board or an oiled marble plate, left to cool, and then cut into small rhombic-shaped pieces. Variants of nunt exist where poppy seed is added along with the walnuts, or the honey is enriched with ginger or sesame.
