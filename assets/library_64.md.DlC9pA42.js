Once the flakes of leftover gold (called \\"skewings\\") have been gathered, they are mixed with a small amount of honey and ground together with a mortar and pestle until they become a powder. The honey is then removed by placing this mixture in a bath of hot water, leaving the gold flakes to collect at the bottom. The upper layer of water is poured off and the process is repeated several times, the last few with deionized water. Following the final rinse, the flakes are left to dry. Once the water has nearly evaporated, a drop of concentrated gum arabic is added and mixed into the flakes, creating a basic paint with gold flakes/ dust as pigment. The paint may be applied to a surface using either a brush or the tip of a finger, and can be \\"reactivated\\" by only the moisture in an exhaled breath of air.

After Tennessee became the 38th and final state needed to ratify the amendment in August 1920, Georgia did not allow women to vote in the 1920 election citing a requirement that one must be registered six months before the election in order to vote.

Georgia would not ratify the amendment until February 20, 1970. Expanding the electorate All qualified voters are allowed to vote absentee under Georgia law. Referendum and initiative law At city, county and state levels, referendums are only allowed through the support of 2/3rds of both houses of the General Assembly. Only legislatively-referred constitutional amendments are allowed to be voted on by statewide referendum. In addition, county and city referendums must obtain a majority support from the county's delegation to the General Assembly.

The construction broke ground in 2013 and is the only building in Georgia built purposely to house art exhibitions. The museum official opening was held on September 26, 2018, while it opened to the public on October 2, 2018. The museum houses over 3500 artworks, created by over 80 artists during the last 70 years. The museum exhibits private art collection of the family of Dr. George (Gia) Jokhtaberidze and Manana Shevardadze, founders of Magticom, the largest telecommunications company in Georgia.  History  Dr. George (Gia) Jokhtaberidze and Manana Shevardnadze started collecting art in 1990s. After successful entrepreneurial endeavors, Dr. Jokhtaberidze started buying art for personal interests. During one of the shopping visits, the gallery was about to ship art to a foreign country for very low prices. Soon Dr. Jokhtaberidze came to realize that if art was scattered around the world without proper collection, documentation and exhibition, art would be lost forever. Since most of the art was created during the Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain, the art was not yet well-known. Thus, the mission was born: to collect, restore and preserve Georgian art. In the beginning, the mission did not include the idea to build a completely new museum building, the idea was to collect and donate all the art to state museums. However, due to the collapse of the USSR and subsequent economic and civil turmoils, the state museums were left in dire situation and would not be able to accept all the art. After collecting art for over 23 years and succeeding in leading the largest telecommunication company in Georgia, Dr. George Jokhtaberidze saw an opportunity to buy real estate right in front of the building of Parliament of Georgia. An opportunity was quickly turned into a plan to build a complex of buildings that would become the Georgian Museum of Fine Arts and the Art House.

Origin and History  Hiravan Pranjivandas, the founder of Society Tea, started out as tea wholesaler in Mumbai‚Äôs famous Masjid Bunder Chai Galli in 1924. The street was regarded as Maharashtra‚Äôs source of tea as traders from different parts of the state would come here to purchase tea, to sell it locally. During this time, Das established tea trade with Middle Eastern countries. In 1933, he founded Hasmukhrai & Co to sell tea to the citizens of Mumbai. He established his first shop in Kalbadevi. Hasmukhrai & Co became the market leader in Mumbai‚Äôs tea Industry by the late 1980s.

This packaged tea was sold for retail, first in Mumbai and later in Maharashtra, in the name of Society Tea. Hashmukh Rai & Co presently has multiple outlets in Mumbai in Kalbadevi, Pydhuni, Fort, Dadar, Malad, Borivali, Ghatkopar and Thane.  Packaging and Marketing Strategy  Society tea adopted the colour blue as the packaging colour for the brand. Karan Shah, the fourth-generation Director of the company, said his father Atul Shah was responsible for choosing the brand colour. According to Karan, ‚ÄúMarket research dictated the colour of packaging to be red, green or yellow, but my father decided to ignore the research and painted Society Tea blue as the market was cluttered with shades of red and green, and he wanted his new brand to stand out naturally.‚Äù  Market Penetration  Society Tea is the largest tea-seller in the state of Maharashtra, with a 40% market share within the state.

So it is identified with Ra Khengar stepwell by Madhusudan Dhaky and dated between 1230 and 1240. The dating is also supported by the stylistic evidences. The construction is mistakenly attributed to Chudasama ruler Khengara, who reigned from about 1098 to 1125 CE.

He fought on both the English and Scottish sides and was killed while fighting on the Scottish side during the Battle of Halidon Hill. Life Prendergast, who held lands at Cornhill-on-Tweed, Northumberland and Stirlingshire, Scotland, was a member of the English garrison at Berwick Castle in 1311. William was congratulated for his gallant service in the English garrison at Jedburgh Castle in January 1315. He was later accused of handing the castle over to the Scots. He had entered King Robert I of Scotland‚Äôs peace after the English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn, with his lands at Cornhill-on-Tweed confiscated, by the English. With Sir William Keith and Alexander Gray, led a force of around 200 Scottish cavalry, with some difficulty, to force their way across the ruins of the bridge to the northern bank of the Tweed and then make their way into Berwick, in an attempt to relieve Berwick, under siege by an English army led by King Edward III of England. The Berwick defenders argued that cavalry constituted the relief according to the truce and that they did not have to surrender the town or castle of Berwick to the English. Edward III stated that this was not the case: they had to be relieved directly from Scotland, whereas the relief force had approached Berwick from the direction of England. The Guardian of Scotland Archibald Douglas considered that the town had been relieved and sent messages to Edward III calling on him to depart, threatening that if he failed to do so the Scots army would devastate England. Edward III ruled that this was a breach of the agreement and commenced construction of gallows outside the town walls with the Scottish hostage Thomas Seton, the son of the Alexander Seton, the Governor of Berwick, was hanged in front of his parents. Edward III issued instructions that each day the town failed to surrender, another two hostages should be hanged. As a result, Keith, who had taken over the command of the town from Seton, concluded a fresh truce, promising to surrender if not relieved by Tuesday 20 July. Keith, Grey and Prendergast were allowed immediately safe passage to leave Berwick and to travel to wherever Douglas happened to be, advise him of the change of circumstances and return safely to Berwick. They found Douglas at Bamburgh in Northumberland. The Scottish army crossed the Tweed to the west of the English army position, reaching Duns. The following day, the Scottish army approached Halidon Hill from the north-west, ready to give battle with the English. During the battle, Prendergast was killed. His son William was able to regain the lands of Cornhill-on-Tweed. Notes  Citations   References  *Brown, Michael.

On November 8, the band announced Stuffed & Ready, which serves as the follow-up to their 2017 record Apocalipstick. The announcement was accompanied by the release of the second single, \\"Daddi\\", and its music video.

The line, including a 34.58 kilometre-long section of the Bodensee‚ÄìToggenburg railway (Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn) that became part of the new S√ºdostbahn as the result of a merger in 2001, has been electrified since 15 May 1939 at 15 kV AC 162/3 Hz.  History The line was built to give access to the Gotthard Railway. Due to the local conditions, the W√§denswil‚ÄìEinsiedeln section was built with a grade of up to 5.0%. The line was taken into operations on 29 July 1891 and officially opened on 31 July. However, official approval for regular operations did not arrive until 4 August. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that between 31 July and 3 August 1891 Schwyz was celebrating the 600 anniversary of the foundation of the Swiss Confederation and therefore already had special trains for this celebration. The first scheduled train ran on 8 August 1891. The first authorisation was still subject to conditions and operations were therefore limited. The final approval was only granted after the official bridge tests in 1892 as further work had to be carried out on some bridges. Finance for electrification was not secured for a long time, but it was eventually approved at the General Meeting on 6 July 1938. Work began immediately on building the overhead line and the transmission lines. It was scheduled to be completed before the Swiss National Exhibition of 1939 in Z√ºrich (Landi 39). The electricity would be supplied at cost price from the Etzel works of the SBB. The electrification succeeded and the lines were electrified within 10 months. A small celebration took place on 13 May. Electrical operations should have been started on the entire network of the S√ºdostbahn at the timetable change on 15 May 1939. However, the railway did not have its own electric rolling stock at this time. The eight railcars (CFZe 4/4 and BCFZe 4/4) ordered in 1938 had not yet been delivered. Biberegg station was opened as a halt for winter sports in 1935 and it was converted into a normal halt in 1979. Riedmatt station was opened in 1974. Freienbach station was upgraded to a crossing station in 1988. Due to the increase in traffic, the line between Samstagern and Schindellegi-Feusisberg was duplicated in 1992. Deformations developed in the lower part of Lustenau tunnel (or Tunnel No. 2). These were caused by the slope pressures and the cutting of the valley side as a result of the relocation of a cantonal road on the ridge pierced by the tunnel. The deformations became so strong at the beginning of 1975 that intervention work became inevitable. The tunnel was converted into a cutting with a retaining wall in May 1975. Replacement bus services lasted 12 days. Since 15 October 1977, the Pf√§ffikon‚ÄìArth-Goldau line has been equipped at least to the former SBB profile I, that is a rail weight of . The restrictions on axle load and linear load on bridges could then be lifted. Since 2018, all rolling stock up to and including class D4 ( axle load, linear load) have been allowed on the line.According to the map of FDV AB, section 5.1 chapter 4.2.4, as of 1 July 2017 ()  References  =Footnotes= =Sources= * Category:Railway lines in Switzerland Category:Railway lines opened in 1891 Category:1891 establishments in Switzerland ","title":"Pf√§ffikon‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway"},{"id":"59624897","text":"Minna Beckmann-Tube (5 July 1881 - 30 July 1964) was a German painter and opera singer.Notice on dnb.de.

Martin was a member of the Norths sides which reached the preliminary finals in 1952 and 1953 and qualified for the finals in 1954. Martin also represented New South Wales City and played an exhibition match against the American All Stars in 1953. After leaving North Sydney, Martin returned to New Zealand and played rugby league in the local competitions. He died on 18 May 2017.

Biography Graham Bull grew up in South Africa. After education at Cape Town's Diocesan College, he attended the University of Cape Town, where he graduated MB ChB in 1939. After briefly engaging in general practice, he was appointed tutor and medical assistant at the Groote Schuur Hospital. In 1947 the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him a travelling fellowship, enabling him to study in London at the Hammersmith Hospital's Royal Postgraduate Medical School, where he graduated MD in 1947 with thesis Postural Proteinuria. The cardiologist John McMichael appointed him to a lectureship at the school of medicine in Hammersmith. Shortly after the end of WWII, Willem Johan Kolff, the famous pioneer of hemodialysis, donated artificial kidney machines to institutions in Poland, as well as Amsterdam and London. Kolff briefly worked at Hammersmith to set up an artificial kidney machine with the rheumatologist Eric Bywaters and the nephrologist A. Mark 'Jo' Joekes. Bull joined the team of Bywaters and Joekes working on renal therapies. When Bywaters left in 1947 to become a medical director in Buckinghamshire, Bull became the leader of the renal unit at Hammersmith. Bull was appointed in 1952 to a professorial chair of medicine at Queen's University, Belfast (that institution's first such professorship). He directed the establishment of record linking systems among hospitals and general practitioners and also supported Belfast's flying ambulance service for heart attack victims. He helped to establish a department of medical statistics and served as chair of the Northern Ireland Hospital Authority's committees for medical education and research. In 1955 he delivered the Goulstonian Lectures on The Ur√¶mias. Bull was appointed in 1966 director of the Medical Research Council‚Äôs new clinical research centre at Northwick Park in northwest London. He served on several committees for medical advice and investigation. In 1970 he became a member of the executive council of the Ciba Foundation and was a trustee from 1979 until his death. Bull was elected FRCP in 1954 and was knighted in 1976. He retired in 1978. In 1988 the Sir Graham Bull Memorial Prize was founded at the Royal College of Physicians. Graham and Megan Bull had four children: a daughter who became a consulting paediatric cardiologist, and three sons who became, respectively, an accountant, a zoologist and a musician. Bull regime J. G. G. Borst in Amsterdam and Bull and his colleagues in London based their dietary therapy on 3 principles: (1) restrict the patient's intake of fluid to precisely balance the patient's output of fluid; (2) eliminate the patient's dietary protein and provide adequate calories to reduce the patient's endogenous breakdown of proteins; (3) give the patient no electrolytes except to replace known losses. Bull achieved these 3 objectives by feeding the patient a carefully measured, synthetic 'diet' consisting of glucose, peanut oil, and water.

Francis was commissioned into the Navy himself as a lieutenant in 1775. In 1777 he was given command of the troopship Lord Amherst in Jamaica, but the ship was wrecked on Bermuda when transporting wounded soldiers back to England. He had better luck with his next command, the cutter Rattlesnake in the Channel fleet, when they captured a French West-Indiaman, after which he was promoted commander. He then took the Aetna 8 to Africa in 1779 and took part in the capture of the island of Gor√©e in Senegal from the French before sailing to the West Indies. There he was promoted captain and briefly given command of HMS Sphinx, a 20 gun six- rater before transferring to HMS Brune, 32-gun frigate, with which he captured a French ship, the Renard and the privateer Resolution.

He did research on the psychology of perception, cognitive science, and the history of psychology. His publications since 2015, about manipulation in media and politics and the transformation of representative democracy to neoliberal elite democracy, have gained considerable attention.  Academic career  From 1969 to 1979, Mausfeld studied psychology, mathematics, and philosophy at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn and mathematical psychology at the University of Nijmegen. Subsequently, he was a consultant at the Institute for Test and Talent Research of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes in Bonn until 1981. In 1984, Mausfeld received his doctorate from the University of Bonn with a thesis about Fechner-Scaling. The thesis focuses on the principles of the construction of psychophysical discrimination scales. In 1987, he became Visiting Research Professor at the University of California. In 1990, Mausfeld was resident, or habilitated, in Bonn with research work mainly on perceptual psychology, and in 1992, he accepted a professorship in general psychology at the University of Mannheim. In 1993, he moved to the University of Kiel. Among other projects, Mausfeld was head of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) project Farbkonstanz and, from 1995 to 1996, head of an international research group at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (ZiF) in Bielefeld. Since 2004, he has been a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in its Psychology and Cognitive Science Section. Since 2009, Mausfeld has also published on topics outside psychophysics and perceptual psychology, such as white torture. Translated as  Research topics  Mausfeld's research focused on perceptual psychology. He also worked on the theoretical foundations of experimental psychology and the psychology of understanding. He also deals with the rivalry between cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience in cognitive science. Another area of interest is the history of ideas in the natural sciences. In contrast to attempts to explain psychological functions on a biological basis, he adopts an antireductionist stance. = Color perception = Mausfeld argues that, contrary to na√Øve realism, color perception and other aspects of visual perception do not simply reflect an objective, mind-independent external physical world. Color is a subjective product of an organism's visual system, not an objective property of the physical world. The \\"measuring instrument\\" conception of perception‚Äîaccording to which the perceptual system is a kind of measuring device that informs the organism about the physical input‚Äîis misguided. Mausfeld also criticizes the \\"atomistic\\" conception of perception, the idea that the perceptual system builds up perceptions‚Äîas things referring to the external world‚Äîfrom elementary perceptual variables (like sensations of brightness and color) that are tied to elementary physical variables (like intensity and wavelength of light). Studying color perception adequately requires studying more than \\"pure\\" color (e.g., hue, saturation, and brightness). Fully understanding color perception also requires studying texture, regularities governing the interaction of light with different types of surfaces, the ways in which perceivers internally represent regions of space, and many other factors. The overall context of visual perception is crucial for color perception. Sensation is, according to Mausfeld, always shaped by perception. The senses are part of a complex structure in the mind. = Nature and spirit = Mausfeld points out that knowledge of neural circuitry and activity is not enough to explain consciousness and thought processes. Not even the behavior of nematodes can be deduced from the activity of their 302 neurons. According to Mausfeld's view, the relationship between nature and mind must be below the neural level in the sphere of physics. Evidence is given by the fact that nature is actually more enigmatic to us than our consciousness in itself. In modern physics, it has become clear that the physical does not have the properties of matter ascribed to it. Mausfeld sees the special aspect of consciousness in the simplicity and wholeness of the subjective experience, which, however, reveals itself to the psychologist as a complex interaction of unconscious factors. The intrinsic multiperspectivity of thinking, which first opens up the possibilities for thought and action alternatives to humans after Mausfeld results from the complex interplay of the most varied of factors.Psychology, Biology, Cognitive Neurosciences The current dominance of neuro-reductionist positions and their tacit basic assumptions, Psychologische Rundschau, 61 (4), 180-190 ¬© Hogrefe Verlag G√∂ttingen 2010 = White torture and responsibility of science = In his work, Mausfeld illustrates the role of psychologists in the development, application, and justification of modern white torture methods. His work states that the goals of these methods are not, as claimed, the extraction of information, but rather breaking the will, disciplining, humiliating, and shaming the victims. Mausfeld uses the example of torture research to define ethical and legal principles and limits of scientific work. He regards the observance of human rights as fully binding. = Techniques of managing opinions and emotions =  Features and framework of manipulation techniques  The most important feature of manipulative techniques, according to Mausfeld, is that they are invisible. To be effective, they must occur below the threshold of our awareness and take advantage of the \\"weak points\\" of our mind. This \\"opinion management,\\" as Mausfeld puts it, which equals propaganda in the sense of Edward Bernays, is the means the formal democratic order adopts to exercise domination without visible force by creating voluntary consent in the minds of citizens. The techniques aim to make invisible not only facts, but also possibilities of thinking and thus alternative actions (domination of perception). Mausfeld puts his criticism of manipulation techniques within the framework of a fundamental critique of the capitalist economic and social order. Neoliberalism, in his view, has limited and narrowed the understanding of freedom to the choice of one's identity from an \\"identity basket\\" (i.e., to the \\"choice\\" of a given media-mediated lifestyle).  Affective techniques  * Among the techniques to manipulate people's emotional lives, Mausfeld counts fear mongering, that is, the generation of fears. Thus, due to the natural inclination of people to the status quo, the fear of change is fueled. To assess the significance of this instrument, Mausfeld refers to the US political scientist John J. Mearsheimer. * Furthermore, he mentions the creation of the feeling of powerlessness in the population, the feeling of not having control.  Cognitive techniques  According to Mausfeld, cognitive techniques are more important than affective techniques, because opinions are more stable than emotions. Mausfeld examines the following methods: * Representation of facts as opinion * Fragmenting coherent facts so that the context, such as the historical context, is lost * Decontextualization of facts: The context of the facts is removed, so that the facts become incomprehensible isolated individual cases, which have no general relevance * Misleading recontextualization: Information is embedded in a foreign context, so that they take on a different character and, for example, no longer lead to outrage in human rights violations. * Repetition supports the \\"perceived truth\\" * Designing the range of opinions so that the desired seems to be in the middle, which most people strive for, if they are unfamiliar, because they then keep to the middle, seeing it as \\"neutral and balanced\\" * Making facts invisible through media selection, distraction and attention control * \\"Meta-propaganda\\": It is part of every propaganda to claim that the news of the enemy is wrong because it is propaganda = Analysis of \\"neoliberal postdemocracy\\" =  Why do lambs remain silent?  In his 2015 publication (3rd edition 2018) Warum schweigen die L√§mmer? (in English: Why do lambs remain silent? How elitist democracy and neo-liberalism are destroying our society and the basis of our lives.), Mausfeld argues that the original definitions of democracy and freedom have been falsified in language and in the organization of power reminiscent of George Orwell's dystopia. In its present form, representative democracy is seen as merely an \\"oligarchical electoral democracy\\", and freedom is seen as merely the power of the economically successful.Rainer Mausfeld: \\"Why are the lambs silent? How elitist democracy and neoliberalism are destroying our society and our livelihoods.\\" Westend, Frankfurt am Main 2018, p. 8 In his critique of democracy, he draws on the work of Ingeborg Maus and Alex Carey, among others. Securing power by the new elite, which is seen as primarily a financial elite, takes place in new forms of transforming power and manipulating consciousness to make power \\"invisible.\\"Rainer Mausfeld: Why are they silent?

Neo-liberalism, according to Mausfeld, is an emerging ideology that has succeeded in secretly establishing itself as the unique framing narrative and asserting itself as a seemingly unquestionable interpretation of reality \\"without any alternative\\".Rainer Mausfeld: Why are the lambs silent?

Phenomena of a 'deep state' as manifestations of authoritarian capitalism (2017)  This is an essay Mausfeld authorized to be part of the anthology Facade Democracy and Deep State. On the way to an authoritarian age,Rainert Mausfeld: Phenomena of a Deep State as manifestations of authoritarian capitalism. In: Ullrich Mies, Jens Wernicke (ed.): Facade democracy and the deep state. On the way to an authoritarian age. Promedia Verlagsgesellschaft (Vienna) 2017. 240 pages. , p. 47ff. edited by Ulrich Mies and Jens Wernicke, argues that representative democracy was invented for the express purpose of giving people an illusion of power. The proper centers of power, however, are largely invisible to the population and not affected by elections. They are not subject to public accountability and are organized in an authoritarian manner. Mausfeld answers the question of how state rule is organized in a strictly empirical way: the actual centers of political power have been thoroughly investigated,https: //scholar.princeton .edu / sites / default / files / mgilens / files / gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf their power is far beyond any democratic control and can, at the same time, dictate virtually all important political decisions. Using a criterion given by the Federal Agency for Civic Education for the question of whether a form of rule should be described as democracy, Mausfeld maintains that \\"Western capitalist democracies are a novel form of totalitarian rule.\\" Yet, he dismisses the conception of a \\"deep state\\" as presented by Mike Lofgren. Mausfeld sees this concept as too simple. In his view, this term attributes causes in too concrete a manner to decisions of individual agents, thereby overlooking the subtler real mechanisms of social control.  Private life  Mausfeld lives in Danish-Nienhof and is married to the psychologist and psychoanalyst Gisela Bergmann-Mausfeld.  Bibliography   Mausfeld, R. (2002).

The team was an owned-and-operated member of the XFL founded by Vince McMahon‚Äôs Alpha Entertainment and plays its home games at The Dome at America's Center. On August 3rd, 2020 Dwayne Johnson, along with his business partners, acquired the XFL and the rights to the Battlehawks. St. Louis joins Seattle, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, Tampa Bay and Washington, D.C. as the league's inaugural cities. Teams had 45-man active rosters and play a 10-week season. Vince McMahon said ‚Äúthe game will feature simplified rules for a faster pace of game that should complete in under three hours‚Äù, and draw from former college and NFL players. Market overview The BattleHawks were the only XFL team not to share its market with a current National Football League franchise; St. Louis had hosted NFL football in 1923 with the All-Stars, 1934 with the Gunners, 1960 to 1987 with the Football Cardinals, and again from 1995 to 2015 with the Rams, which relocated to Los Angeles in the 2016 season. There is a significant negative sentiment against the NFL in St. Louis, as both the Cardinals and Rams relocated to new markets, citing a division between the teams' ownership and both the city & county governments of St. Louis to adequately provide a new stadium and the unacceptable condition of the Dome at America's Center. (The Dome was the last NFL stadium to be built with a fully opaque and fixed roof, which led to a lack of ambient light and, coupled with the Rams' decision to switch to a darker uniform color palette in the early 2000s, resulted in one of the darkest stadium environments in the NFL.) As St. Louis was one of the most recent cities to lose an NFL team, with acceptable facilities by XFL standards, the area was seen as a good choice to take advantage of a newly empty football market. St. Louis has very little history of hosting alternative professional football. None of the major alternative outdoor leagues of the late 20th and early 21st centuries had a team there, and the Arena Football League's only presence was the St. Louis Stampede of 1995 and 1996. Some indoor football teams have played at Family Arena in suburban St. Charles, Missouri, including the RiverCity Rage and River City Raiders. St. Louis has also been devoid of NCAA Division I Football since 1949, when the Saint Louis University Billikens dropped football as an intercollegiate sport; the nearest FBS football squad, the Missouri Tigers, play in Columbia. The St. Louis BattleHawks share the Missouri winter sports market with one other major professional team, the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues, and with the Billikens' and Tigers' college basketball teams.  Stadium  The Dome at America's Center was originally built for the Rams and as an addition to the adjoining St. Louis Convention Center. After the departure of the Rams, the Dome continued to host a plethora of other events, enough that the stadium was unable to host a team in the former Alliance of American Football for the 2019 season. The XFL will pay $800,000 in rent to use the Dome (a $300,000 flat fee plus $100,000 for each game) in exchange for keeping all of the revenue from ticket sales; the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission will keep concession and parking revenue. For XFL games, the Dome has a reduced capacity, similar to the former San Antonio Commanders use of the Alamodome and the earlier XFL's Orlando Rage at the Citrus Bowl, bringing the stadium's capacity down to around 28,000.https://twitter.com/XFLBattleHawks/status/1181581179968983042/photo/1 Along with CenturyLink Field, it is the one of two XFL venues in a downtown city center. After two consecutive sellouts of the lower bowl, city officials began planning to open up some sections of the upper decks to accommodate more fans while still maintaining the up-close intimate atmosphere the league seeks.https://kmox.radio.com/articles/news/st-louis-battlehawks-looking-to- add-seats The team uses Rams Park in Earth City as their practice facility. Since the Rams departure, the facility has been used by Lou Fusz Soccer Club. The league has also said that it would be interested in having the BattleHawks play at the St. Louis MLS Stadium when it opens in 2023, given its new amenities, better lighting and capacity closer to projected attendance. Three XFL teams share stadiums with MLS teams. Fan base The BattleHawks led every other team in followers on Twitter, Instagram, and in fan attendance. The St. Louis media market led the nation in television viewership for the opening week, posting a 7.4 Nielsen rating for the BattleHawks first game.

Research  Liu studies epilepsy which arises from focal cortical dysplasia. She investigates the surgically removed tissues and found that they are influenced by circadian rhythm. The protein CLOCK (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) is a transcription factor that is important in regulating circadian rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Liu analysed the transcriptome of surgically removed tissues and found differences in the RNA of CLOCK. They created mouse models, one with neurons defunct in CLOCK and the other with neurons lacking inhibitory cells. The mice without limited CLOCK suffered from epilepsy similar to humans. In 2017 she was awarded a Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy award to study the molecular CLOCK and sleep-associated seizures. She contributed to the 2012 book Jasper's Basic Mechanisms of the Epilepsies.

She is a Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and served as the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources under President Ernesto Zedillo from 1994 to 2000.  Early life & education  Carabias was born in Mexico City on August 11, 1954 as the child of Basque immigrants from Spain. As a child, she witnessed the difficulties that came with living in a developing country. She told The Japan Times that these early childhood observations informed her interest in alleviating poverty and conserving the environment. She later went on to receive her Bachelor of Science in 1977 and Master of Science in 1981 in biology from National Autonomous University of Mexico.  Research & public service  In 1977, Carabias joined the faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where she taught and researched until 1994, developing programs that focused on Botany, Ecology, Natural Resource Management, Ecological Restoration, and Conservation. There, her research centered on strategies to regenerate tropical forests and the use of natural resources. Between 1989 and 1993, Carabias served on the UNAM University Council. She left the university between 1994 and 2000 to serve in the Ernesto Zedillo administration and returned to the university in 2001. = Early public service = Given her research interests directly intersect with public policy, she has drawn the attention of government officials. In 1982, she was asked by the Governor of Guerrero‚Äîone of Mexico's poorest states and one highly impacted by environmental destruction‚Äîto develop a plan to improve local standards of living, while conserving natural resources in the area. She worked with a team of economists and ecologists to devise a four-year program, called the Rural Research and Development Program for the Integral Use of Natural Resources (PAIR), that gained international recognition as a standard for developing countries to follow. PAIR was subsequently adapted for four other Mexican states between 1984 and 1994, at the request of the President. Each plan had to be adapted to the distinct climates of each state, which varied from dry tropical forest, tropical rain forest, temperate forest, and desert. She documented some of these efforts in the book Rural Production in Mexico: Ecological Alternatives, published in 1989. Carabias is the author of many scientific articles on botany, ecology, natural resource management, ecological restoration, and conservation. In addition to Rural Production in Mexico: Ecological Alternatives, she is also the co-author of Ecology and Alimentary Self-Sufficiency and Natural Resource Management and Rural Poverty. In 2005, she was named one of the United Nations seven Champions of the Earth, which in part recognized her leadership of the PAIR program. In 1992, Carabias was on the team that published the report For Earth's Sake during the United Nations sponsored Conference on the Environment and Development in Brazil. The report was commissioned by the Commission on Developing Countries and Global Change and centers on the southern hemisphere's perspective on the intersection between environment and global development. Carabias and her collaborators conclude by proposing equitable approaches to sustainable development and a research agenda to enable those approaches. = Service in the Zedillo Administration = Carabias officially entered government service in 1994, acting as President of Mexico‚Äôs National Institute of Ecology and joined the advisory council of the National Conservation Fund. On December 1, 1994, she became the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, serving in the cabinet of former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo until the end of his term in 2000. During her tenure, she worked on a number of environmental conservation and restoration projects. She responded to forest fires that devastated the Chimalapas biological reserve in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. She worked to pass a number of fire-control regulations, including a new forest law in 1997 and a wildlife law in 2000, working to build consensus between rural communities and legislators. People who wished to burn were required to submit a form ten days in advance that specified the time, location and size of burn, and who would be in attendance to ensure that the right protections were put in place in advance. She also doubled the region of Mexico's protected areas to more than six percent, which had the effect of safeguarding species like the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), the pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) of Baja California, the manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the jaguar (Panthera onca) of Yucat√°n. In particular, she worked with former United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, focusing on land and resource management of deserts along the US-Mexico border. In addition, she coordinated Mexican and American officials to work on restoring the natural course of river flow along the border between the two countries. She also helped incorporate sustainable development into Mexico's National Development Plan, adding environmental considerations into economic planning. = Post-political career = U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Carlos Pascual and CEIBA's Julia Carabias Lillo listen to a question from the audience at the U.S. Center at COP-16 in Cancun, Mexico, on December 8, 2010. Carabbias returned to UNAM in 2001, re-joining the Faculty of Science. There, she coordinates the Master's degree program in Restoration Ecology and has resumed her research projects related to conservation, restoration, and management of the tropical rain forest of the Selva Lacandona, Chiapas. During the same year, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) awarded her the J. Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize. Carabias donated the cash portion of it equaling $100,000 to the protection of the Chajul region of southern Mexico's Lacandon forests. Carabias served on the board of directors of Resources for the Future, an international environmental research organization between 2001 and 2004. Between 2002 and 2004, Carabias served as the Chair of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel, an independent advisory body established by the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF). In 2004, she established the training center for biodiversity in the Lacandon region in Chiapas. Carabias was awarded The International Cosmos Prize in 2004 and in 2005 she received the United Nations Environmental Programme Champions of the Earth Prize. She currently serves as the President of Centro Interdisciplinario de Biodiversidad y Ambiente, or CeIBA, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to bringing together researchers and specialists to promote the analysis, design, and implementation of public policies around conservation. In 2017, Carabias was awarded the Mexican Belisario Dom√≠nguez medal, a recognition granted by Mexico's Senate to recognize outstanding citizens for their service to the country and humanity.

The USFL had the Washington Federals (a mostly unsuccessful franchise) in its first two years. Then the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars moved from Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Byrd Stadium in College Park, Maryland, in 1985, winning the USFL's final championship. The Canadian Football League's Baltimore CFL Colts/Stallions were the only successful American team in the league during their two-year existence in the mid-1990s (and were the only American-based team to win the Grey Cup, the CFL's championship). Indoor teams to have played in Washington include the Washington Commandos and the Washington Valor (which folded two months before the Defenders' first game) of the Arena Football League, and the D.C.

Built about 1884 to nearly identical designs by Fuller & Delano, the buildings are well-preserved examples of Victorian Gothic architecture executed in brick. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, but due to administrative lapses, are not listed in its NRIS database..Procedural confusion around the listing of the Robinson and Swan Blocks, documented in National Archives file #63792971, appears to have inadvertently resulted in the omission of the property from subsequent database sources at the federal level. It was not assigned a reference number until 2016, and is (as of 2019) not listed in the NRIS database, the National Park Service's official repository of listings. Description and history The Robinson and Swan Blocks are located two blocks west of downtown Worcester, at the southeast corner of Pleasant and Irving Streets. Both buildings are brick structures, three stories in height. The two buildings are virtually identical in their designs, except for the treatment of the ground floor street facades. The Robinson Block, which faces Pleasant Street, is five bays wide, with storefront display window bays flanking a recessed center entrance on the ground floor. The center and outer bays of the upper floors project slightly, and the building is crowned by a corbelled brick cornice. The center bay has two windows, topped on the second floor by shouldered brownstone lintels, while the outer bays have single windows with similar lintels; the third-floor windows in these bays have segmented-arch tops. The Swan Block, facing Irving Street, differs in having a more residential treatment of the ground floor, with sash windows flanking a more elaborate entrance. The property on which the blocks were built housed the residence of George Swan, a lawyer. In 1884, Swan had these two building erected on the lot, retaining the local architectural firm of Fuller & Delano to design them. He sold the Robinson Block to physician Joseph Robinson the following year. Each used their building to house both their professional offices and their residences; there is evidence that both also had a second residential unit that may have been rented out.

Led by Mitsuharu Misawa, they later formed their own promotion, Pro Wrestling Noah.  Background  = History = All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) was founded in 1972 by Shohei \\"Giant\\" Baba, Mitsuo Momota and Yoshihiro Momota, a student and the two sons of Rikid≈çzan, the godfather of Japanese professional wrestling, or Puroresu. Baba served as the promotion's president, head booker, talent scout and head trainer for much of his lifetime. Under Baba, the promotion enjoyed much success, and reached new heights in the 1990s thanks mostly to the performances of Mitsuharu Misawa, Toshiaki Kawada, Kenta Kobashi and Akira Taue, dubbed \\"The Four Pillars Of Heaven\\" by magazines and reporters. Baba continued to run the promotion until late 1998 when his health deteriorated and he was hospitalized in January 1999. = Build-up = Baba died from liver failure (a complication of colon cancer) on January 31, 1999, at the age of 61. In the wake of his death, widow and majority shareholder Motoko Baba intended for Mitsuo Momota to inherit the presidential position, but board member Jumbo Tsuruta used his influence to help Misawa inherit the position, before Tsuruta himself was forced out of the company (with no severance package). Misawa was trained for the position during the following months, and was officially announced as AJPW president during a press conference on May 7. Disagreements with Motoko Baba arose even before the transition was made public, as reports of a \\"quiet\\" power struggle saw print in March 1999, and Tsuruta confirmed these when he left Japan for Portland, Oregon. In fact, the two had had professional tensions long beforehand. Motoko had opposed the decision to push Misawa in the wake of Genichiro Tenryu's departure in 1990, and the two began conflicting as early as 1996; in the year before Shohei Baba's death, Misawa even asked him on behalf of the locker room to have his wife leave the company, and was somewhat successful in that she ceased to have any creative influence when Misawa began booking. Misawa attempted to keep Baba content by maintaining the same salary that she had been paid when her husband was alive (approximately $500,000), but this did not change the power dynamic. Misawa's wish to change the AJPW product, and to modernize its presentation, to address their box office troubles ran in direct opposition to Baba's intent to maintain her late husband's booking philosophy. Misawa was particularly intent on pushing the company's younger talent, and in September 1999 he and Baba had a major fight over a match between Jun Akiyama and Takao Omori being the main event of a Budokan show (which sold out), although this match's placement had been decided by a fan ballot. Motoko's conservatism was partially due to her belief that the company, and Japanese wrestling as a whole, had fallen from its peak. Misawa was also angry with Motoko over fiscal matters, as he had discovered that much of the company's merchandise sales did not produce funds for AJPW, but for a subsidiary that she had set up. At some point, Misawa approached Nippon TV with his plans to leave AJPW to start a new promotion, and told them that nearly everyone in the locker room would follow him. NTV officials told Misawa that they supported him, but that they needed to keep their agreement quiet for the time being as, due to the proximity of Baba's death, the station wanted to wait until enough time had passed to drop All Japan's television program, which had been associated closely with NTV since its formation. Nevertheless, rumors that NTV had taken Misawa's side in his dispute against Baba saw print in February 2000, and Weekly Fight Magazine reported that AJPW would split into two groups in May, though Misawa declined to comment on this. Adding to the situation was that, as of the end of the fiscal year on March 31, 2000, all the promotion's talent were working as free agents, since Misawa was not authorized to give the raises he intended to award all native workers; Misawa had also wanted to modernize their contracts, providing wrestlers with full medical coverage, full injury pay, and possibly stock options (which NJPW's contracts offered). As the result of these disagreements, the AJPW executive board voted to remove Misawa from the presidential position on May 28. All parties agreed to keep this news private until the end of the current tour, and Misawa attempted to persuade Baba to give him her public blessings to start a new company, so as to smooth the public transition and preserve the legacies of Giant Baba and the recently deceased Tsuruta. Baba refused this proposal or relinquishment of any of her majority share, and Tokyo Sports broke the news on June 12. At an emergency board meeting held in response on June 13, co-vice president Mitsuo Momota and fellow boardsmen Kobashi, Taue, Kenichi Oyagi, and Yoshihiro Momota collectively resigned from their positions.  Incident  On June 16, 2000, a press conference was led by Mitsuharu Misawa, where 24 of the 26 native wrestlers contracted to All Japan Pro Wrestling joined him. With over 100 reporters and news outlets in attendance, Misawa announced that everyone surrounding him would be leaving All Japan Pro Wrestling after finishing their last committed appearances in July, and that they would be forming a new promotion together. A day later, Misawa announced the promotion's name: Pro Wrestling Noah. On June 19, 2000, it was confirmed at a press conference in the All Japan dojo held by Toshiaki Kawada and Masanobu Fuchi that NTV had agreed to discontinue broadcasting All Japan Pro Wrestling after 27 years with the network. NTV also announced that they would carry weekly tapings of Misawa's new Noah promotion, with the title of the program being called \\"Colosseo\\", in the place of All Japan's former 30-minute timeslot on Sundays at midnight. On June 20, Misawa met with Nippon TV officials, who had cancelled All Japan's television program, and secured a time slot for NOAH programming. On July 2 at Korakuen Hall, Motoko Baba came out to the ring and announced the unfathomable return of Genichiro Tenryu to All Japan. This was previously unfathomable as Giant Baba had sworn to banish him from ever competing in the promotion again after Tenryu led his own exodus from AJPW in 1990 to form the Super World of Sports (SWS) promotion. Baba announced he would team with Toshiaki Kawada to face Maunakea Mossman and Stan Hansen on July 23 on the final show of the Super Action Series Tour in Nippon Budokan. On July 20, 2000, Yoshinobu Kanemaru, Takeshi Morishima, Naomichi Marufuji, Kentaro Shiga, Takeshi Rikio, Mitsuo Momota, Rusher Kimura, Haruka Eigen, Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, Kenta Kobayashi, Takao Omori, Yoshihiro Takayama, Jun Izumida, Masao Inoue, Yoshinari Ogawa, Akira Taue, Jun Akiyama and Mitsuharu Misawa competed in their last matches for All Japan Pro Wrestling at the sold- out Hakata Star Lane in Fukuoka. During the show, \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams came out and shook Misawa's hand, and requested one last singles match between the two. However, Misawa returned to the bus immediately after his match, not staying for the last two matches of the show and the match never happened. Every single one of All Japan's titles were vacated due to the departure of the aforementioned wrestlers and title holders. Mrs. Baba later appointed Stan Hansen as the new Chairman of All Japan's Pacific Wrestling Federation title governing body, replacing Lord James Blears.  Aftermath  Although a mass exodus in Japanese pro wrestling was not unheard of, an exodus of this size was unprecedented at the time, rivalled only by Tenryu's exodus to form SWS in 1990. The event caused a shockwave throughout Japanese sports tabloids, and newfound attention was bought to Misawa and his new promotion. The two promotions would eventually begin working together in 2004, with Keiji Mutoh and Taiyo Kea facing Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa at Departure 2004 in the Tokyo Dome, and Misawa returning to All Japan twice in 2004. = All Japan Pro Wrestling = After the new Noah roster wrestled their last matches for the promotion, All Japan began the process of rebuilding itself, relying on freelance talent and cross promotional matches to fill its cards. On August 11, 2000, Masanobu Fuchi appeared at the New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) show in Ryogoku Kokugikan. Standing in a New Japan ring for the first time in his career, Fuchi announced his intention to \\"break down the walls\\" between All Japan and New Japan, and he was soon joined in the ring by NJPW foreman Riki Choshu. The two exchanged a handshake in the ring, and thus a cross promotional relationship began between All Japan Pro Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling. The first major cross promotional matches between NJPW and AJPW took place on October 9, 2000 at NJPW Do Judge!! in the Tokyo Dome. Fuchi, Dr. Death Steve Williams and Toshiaki Kawada all represented AJPW on the card, with Kawada shockingly defeating IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kensuke Sasaki in a non-title match in the main event. This led to Sasaki, in kayfabe, becoming so disgusted with himself for losing to an outsider that he vacated the championship. The two promotions continued to work together, with Fuchi and Kawada regularly appearing in NJPW throughout late 2000. All Japan returned to the Tokyo Dome for the first time since the exodus on January 28, 2001, with appearances from Keiji Mutoh and Jushin Thunder Liger, as well as a main event featuring Kensuke Sasaki teaming up with Toshiaki Kawada to defeat Genichiro Tenryu and Hiroshi Hase. = Pro Wrestling Noah = Pro Wrestling Noah debuted on August 5, 2000 in Differ Ariake, main evented by a 2 out of 3 falls match putting Kenta Kobashi and Jun Akiyama against Mitsuharu Misawa and Akira Taue, won by Akiyama and Kobashi. Misawa later established the promotion's championships as the Global Honored Crown, and a tournament was held for the GHC Heavyweight Championship in 2001, where Misawa defeated Yoshihiro Takayama in the final to become the inaugural champion. Interest in the fledgling promotion was high, and Misawa used this to push younger talent over himself, with Jun Akiyama winning the title in July 2001. Despite the positive reception to Akiyama's reign, head booker Misawa grew anxious that a lack of legitimate title contenders would damage both the title and Akiyama's reputation early in the promotion's life, and in April 2002 Akiyama dropped the championship to Yoshinari Ogawa as a stepping stone to get the championship back to Misawa.

Coyner, was an American grave robber, murderer, cannibal and suspected serial killer. While living at a house in Ferndale, Michigan, Robinson was suspected of murdering and decapitating 4 women, but there was insufficient evidence to convict him. He was eventually sentenced to death and executed for murdering Mr. and Mrs. Aurelius B. Turner in his hometown of Cleveland. Biography Born into an impoverished family in Cleveland, Mississippi, Robinson was first arrested by hometown authorities in 1918 for mailing obscene letters to local women. He managed to escape while en route to the jail, sustaining a bullet injury to his shoulder in the process. Using the alias of \\"James H. Coyner\\", Robinson moved to Ferndale, Michigan sometime in 1926. Around this time, the bodies of decapitated women had started turning up around the city, with the authorities immediately suspecting Robinson. By 1927, he had been convicted and imprisoned at the Indiana State Penitentiary in Michigan City for stealing a girl's corpse from a local graveyard. While imprisoned, he was questioned by Ferndale authorities about the case, but he simply stated: After being paroled in June 1934, he returned to Cleveland and continued writing obscene letters. One of them was mailed to a woman in Indianapolis, and while it was being investigated by postal inspectors, Robinson had already murdered two more people. =Murder of the Turners= On December 9, 1934, Robinson broke into the Cleveland home of Aurelius B. Turner and his pregnant wife. While Mr. Turner was sitting in a chair and reading a newspaper, he was hit with an axe by Robinson before being shot. Mrs. Turner was then hit approximately five times with the axe, before he mutilated both of their bodies and kept some of the woman's flesh. He also reportedly struck one of the Turners' children over the head and left the child for dead but did not harm the other child, who was sleeping in a crib. Arrest and confession Shortly after the murders, Robinson was arrested on January 12, 1935 by authorities in Shaw, Mississippi after they were able to trace his letters to his post office box. He instinctively grabbed his gun, but the deputies quickly overpowered him and he surrendered. The policemen then proceeded to search his pockets, finding more obscene letters and Mr. Turner's pocket watch, but also a packet of human hair in Mrs. Turner's color and portions of human flesh complete with bite marks, which were salted and cured. Following his arrest, Robinson was moved to a jail in Hinds County. While there, he was questioned for several hours in his cell by District Attorney Greek Rice, along with Sheriffs E. R. McLean and John Roberts, freely confessing to killing the Turners because he \\"had an impulse to kill somebody\\". He was also questioned about the trunk with the missing women's heads found in Ferndale as requested by authorities in Pontiac, and although Robinson claimed that the trunk was indeed his, he denied killing the women, and instead claimed that they were trophies from various grave robbing expeditions. Trial, sentence and death Following his confessions, Robinson was brought to court for his trial. Due to the gruesome nature of his crimes, heavy patrols, organized by the Mississippi National Guard, were placed both in the streets and in the court room. He was speedily convicted and sentenced to death by the judge following a one-day trial, subsequently being sent to a jail in Jackson for safekeeping with an escort of 200 National Guardsmen. On March 5, 1935, in the Bolivar County jail, between 200 and 300 troops guarded the premises as Sheriff McLean was preparing the prisoner for the execution. Grinning broadly as the black hood and noose were pulled over his head, Alonzo Robinson was executed by hanging on the jail's scaffold.

Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 1998 (= Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Staatlichen Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste Stuttgart, ed. Wolfgang Kermer; 9) , pp. 71‚Äì72 Kermer promoted international exchanges with artists and art educational institutions in Australia, Austria and South Korea. His special attention was on previously neglected public relations. He founded and edited the series of publications (1972‚Äì1978), (1975‚Äì2004) and (1996‚Äì2006) and has also written articles and books on modern artists and art education. He has been the curator of numerous exhibitions and high school events and founded in 1975 the Academy Collection with works by current and former teachers as well as alumni.Wolfgang Kermer: Die Sammlung der Stuttgarter Akademie: einige Anmerkungen zur Gr√ºndung, Vorgeschichte und Entwicklung aus Anlass ihres 30‚Äìj√§hrigen Bestehens. Stuttgart: Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste Stuttgart, 2005 (WerkstattReihe / ed. Wolfgang Kermer; 12) One of the highlights was the exhibition of austrian artist Walter Pichler in 1981 with drawings and plans for his architectural projects. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart after World War II, Wolfgang Kermer has organized the large-scale exhibition \\"Zwischen Buch-Kunst und Buch-Design: Buchgestalter der Akademie und ehemaligen Kunstgewerbeschule in Stuttgart\\" which was shown in 1996 at the State Library of W√ºrttemberg in Stuttgart and in 1997 at the Klingspor Museum in Offenbach am Main. Kermer's scholarly work has been devoted since the 1970s to the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart and world-famous professors like Bernhard Pankok, Adolf H√∂lzel, Willi Baumeister, , Alfred Hrdlicka.Nikolai B. Forstbauer: F√ºr das Geschichtsgewissen der Stuttgarter Akademie: dem Kunsthistoriker Wolfgang Kermer zum 70. Geburtstag, Stuttgarter Nachrichten, Nr. 112, 18. Mai 2005, p. 16 One of his specialties is the art and art education of Willi Baumeister: Kermer organized in 1989 the first retrospective of his work as typographer. Baumeister's lithographs printed from Erich M√∂nch at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart he exhibited in 1975,Wolfgang Kermer: Willi Baumeister: Lithographien und Radierungen. Gedruckt von Erich M√∂nch. Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste Stuttgart, 1975. and in 1979 the exhibition \\"Hommage √† Baumeister\\" has shown the artistic creations from twelve of his most famous students. His art theory and pedagogic views he devoted publications in 1971 and 1992.His publications about Willi Baumeister even found resonance in Japanese specialist literature, see Mikio Suzuki (ed.): Reformation of Art Academy in the USA and Germany after or during World War II: German Exiled Directors or Professors and their cultural, Pedagogical Heritage for the Reformation. Kazama Shobo, 2014 , pp. 57‚Äì92 (in Japanese language) Some of Baumeister's writings Kermer reedited in 1999 and 2006. Guest events organized by Wolfgang Kermer in the 1980s with artists such as Roland Goeschl, Richard Hamilton, Oswald Oberhuber, Walter Pichler and Arnulf Rainer as well as co- operative exhibitions such as ‚Ä≥Art Education in Korea: Studies from the College of Fine Arts Seoul National University‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥Anton Kolig‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥The young Kokoschka‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥Brancusi Photographe‚Ä≥ activated the public relations work of the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, a special concern Kermers since the beginning of his rectorate. In 1987 Wolfgang Kermer discovered the forgotten artistic heritage of the Stuttgart Jewish painter , who was murdered in the Holocaust.Wolfgang Kermer: K√ºnstlerin zwischen den Kriegen: Alice Haarburger - eine vergessene Stuttgarter Malerin. In: Amtsblatt der Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart, Nr. 13, 26. M√§rz 1987, p. 8 He succeeded in preventing an unworthy dissolution of the artistic estate. In 2016, he donated two paintings by the artist, which he had acquired in art galleries, to the Museum Spendhaus at Reutlingen, the native town of Alice Haarburger. As far as his own artistic work is concerned, Kermer has exhibited his abstract paintings, drawings, etchings and photographs in more than thirty solo and group exhibitions in Germany since 1954,[Hans Staut]: Ein Bekenntnis zur modernen Kunstauffassung: der junge Wolfgang Kermer stellt aus.

EPOCA was an EU FP7 Integrated Project active during four years, from 2008 to 2012. The EPOCA consortium brought together more than 160 researchers from 32 institutes in 10 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) and was coordinated by the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) with the project office based at the Institut de la Mer de Villefranche, France (formerly Observatoire Oc√©anologique de Villefranche).  Scope  The research carried out through EPOCA was structured around four themes : # Theme 1 investigated the changes in ocean chemistry and biogeography across space and time. Paleo-reconstruction methods were used on several archives, including foraminifera and deep-sea corals, to determine the past variability in ocean chemistry and to tie these to present- day chemical and biological observations; # Theme 2 studied the sensitivity of marine organisms, communities and ecosystems to ocean acidification. Key climate-relevant biogeochemical processes such as calcification, primary production and nitrogen fixation were investigated using a large array of techniques, ranging from molecular tools to physiological and ecological approaches. Perturbation experiments were carried out both in the laboratory and in the field, including a major large-scale offshore mesocosm experiment in Svalbard in 2010 # Theme 3 focused on the integration of the results from Themes 1 and 2 in biogeochemical, sediment, and coupled ocean-climate models to better understand and project the responses of the Earth system to ocean acidification. Special attention was paid to feedbacks of physiological changes on the carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and iron cycles and how these changes will affect and be affected by future climate change; # Finally, Theme 4 synthesized the results from Themes 1-3 and assessed uncertainties, risks and thresholds (\\"tipping points\\") related to ocean acidification at scales ranging from subcellular to ecosystem and local to global scales. A second focus of this theme was to communicate the findings to fellow scientists but also to policy makers, media, schools and the general public.  Legacy  EPOCA significantly contributed to advancing the state of knowledge on ocean acidification and its impact on marine organisms and ecosystems. The project produced more than 200 research articles, equivalent to 20% of the peer- reviewed scientific literature on ocean acidification published during the period 2009-2012.OA-ICC Bibliographic database on ocean acidification https://www.iaea.org/services/oa-icc/science-and-collaboration/data-access- and-managementData compilation on the biological response to ocean acidification https://www.pangaea.de/?f.project=EPOCA EPOCA leaves behind products still widely used by the international scientific community working on ocean acidification, such as : * EPOCA scientists designed and developed the R software package seacarb, which calculates parameters of the seawater carbonate system and includes functions useful for ocean acidification research;R package seacarb https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seacarb/index.html * EPOCA led the production of the community-reviewed ‚Äú _Guide to best practices in ocean acidification research and data reporting_ ‚Äù, published in 2010 as a collaborative effort of EPOCA and international colleagues to provide guidance on design of ocean acidification experiments and to facilitate comparisons of studies and; * EPOCA maintained and pioneered several resources made available to the international ocean acidification research community : ** a news stream on ocean acidification launched in 2006 by Jean-Pierre Gattuso, which provides daily information on the latest scientific articles, media coverage, meetings, and job and training opportunities; ** a bibliographic database including research articles, books and book chapters with allocated keywords, launched in 1995 by Jean-Pierre Gattuso and; ** a compilation of data from peer-reviewed studies investigating a biological response to ocean acidification.

The construction of these waste-to- energy facilities, which has prompted the ensuing protest movement, operates as part of China's ongoing efforts to restructure its waste disposal system in regard to its status as the largest producer of municipal solid waste worldwide since 2004. Described by some as being a new type of NIMBY protest, the roots of the anti-incinerator movement can be traced back to the early 1990s, following the introduction of China's first generation of incinerator plants. The movement, however, began in earnest with the benchmark 2006 Liulitun protest taking place in Beijing. Since the success of the Liulitun plant protest, in which the proposed incinerator in Beijing's Haidian district was indefinitely postponed, numerous other instances of dissent surrounding China's incinerator plants have transpired, with particularly notable examples occurring in Guangzhou, Wujiang and Panguanying. While the individual protests have differed in terms of participants, tactics used and government response, each has been demonstrably oriented around environmental and health concerns emanating from the pollution and potential human cost associated with operating waste-to-energy incinerators. Despite various successes occurring for protests of this type, China's national government has continued to acknowledge incineration as a viable solution for managing municipal waste, and as such, has continued to plan and develop numerous incinerator plants throughout the country.  History  The first instances of dissent aimed at China's waste incinerators occurred as early as 1994, when the nation's first incinerator plant was implemented on the mainland. Since that time as many as 54 cases of incinerator-related disputes have been reported. The protests however did not begin achieving their current prominence and scope until the Liulitun protest in Beijing, which began in 2006 and extended into early 2011, ending with the ultimate cancellation of the incinerator project at its original location. From these events in Beijing's Haidian district stemmed a series of other like-minded protests, led by individuals who had become empowered by the success of the protest in China's capital. Amongst these were protests in Guangzhou, Wujiang and Panguanying, all of which began during or around the time of 2009. In Guangzhou inhabitants of the residential Panyu district began opposing plans to construct a municipal waste incinerator in their area after coming across a posting on a government website. Eventually, by the end of 2011, protesters were able to get the project cancelled at its proposed site, with the government electing to move the plant elsewhere. Similarly, in Pingwang, a town located outside Wujiang city in China's Jiangsu province, residents began opposing the construction of a nearby incinerator plant that was already nearing completion. Their collective efforts, which culminated in a large-scale peaceful demonstration occurring in late 2009, resulted in the plant's construction being halted pending further review. In the same year, in Panguanying, a small rural village in China's Hebei province, villagers utilized assistance from environmental NGOs and urban activists from Beijing to repeatedly halt the project, leading to the proposed plant being shelved after negotiations broke down. In recent years, as China has continued to develop new waste incinerators, protests have occurred in such places as Lubo town, Zhaoqing city and Sihui city, all in China's Guangdong province. In 2017 there was another notable protest in the south- eastern city of Shenzhen opposing the development of the city's Shenzhen East Waste-to-Energy Plant, which would become one of the largest waste incinerators nationwide upon completion.  Key issues and participants  In each anti-incinerator protest, despite the variety of individuals involved, the common goal of protesters has consistently been the prevention or postponement of a planned or operational incinerator facility in their area. Moreover, given their localized nature, each protest has been mainly directed at the local government, though those that were able to transcend local bounds, through media coverage and intervention from activist groups, have been shown to adopt a broader context. In the 2006 Beijing Liulitun protest, participants were largely made up of scholars and science or engineering professionals from nearby universities and businesses who resided the Haidian district. Given the academic backgrounds of these individuals and their prior objection of a noxious landfill already present in the area, the ensuing anti- incinerator protest was particularly conscious of the potential health risks associated with waste incineration. As research suggested to the protesters, incinerator plants, especially those from earlier generations, produce a variety of noxious byproducts containing dioxins, such as fly ash. Production of such harmful chemicals and concerns over how nearby communities would be affected has become the defining issue of the anti-incinerator movement. During the Panyu protest in Guangzhou, participants consisted of long-time residents as well as recent migrants to the newly developed district, a majority of whom were unaware or felt they were not properly informed of the plans to construct an incinerator. As with the Liulitun protest, protesters in Panyu showed concern for their health as well the potential environmental impact of the proposed plant if it were constructed. As such, their demands ranged from a more accessible environmental impact assessment (EIA) to having the project be canceled outright. Like in Beijing, protesters were uniquely assisted by the occupations of professionals residing in the area, many of whom, in this case, were journalists, members of the local media and retired government bureaucrats. In the protest of an incinerator plant being built in the town of Pingwang, which is located near the city of Wujiang, a majority of protesters were local residents. Being inspired by the successful Liulitun protest in Beijing, protesters aimed to prevent the completion of their own nearby plant, citing amongst their concerns the proven detrimental effects of waste incinerators. Unlike previous protests of its kind, the 2009 Panguanying protest, which took place China's Hebei Province, exhibited participation which extended significantly beyond the local sphere. While initially only consisting of residents of the rural Panguanying village, protesters eventually garnered the support of urban environmental activists and legal professionals from Beijing. Participants in the Panguanying protest shared the environmental and health-related motivations of other similar demonstrations, however, they also aimed to expose the malpractice and deceit inherent in the planning and flawed environmental impact assessment of their town's incinerator plant. Throughout the reported protests, various environmentalist groups have gotten involved and supported protesters including the Beijing- based Nature University, Friends of Nature and the Guangzhou-based Eco Canton, the creation of which stemmed directly from the Panyu protest.  Protest strategy and tactics  Tactics employed during anti-incinerator protests have included appealing to local officials, communicating over online services, conducting public demonstrations and utilizing media attention. Another shared factor of many of these protests has been their recognition and, in some cases, direct consultation or imitating of their predecessors. During the Liulitun protest in Beijing, protesters, in emphasis of their concerns regarding the harmful health effects of waste incineration, drew up signs and T shirts with phrases referencing the potential human cost of incinerators and assembled on World Environment Day, June 5, 2007, to express their objection. Protesters also sought legal help from environmental lawyers and produced a lengthy report articulating their opposition to the project, actions which were later emulated by protesters in Panguanying. In Guangzhou, during the Panyu district protest, residents began by exploring the ramifications of municipal waste incinerators by conducting online research and visiting a nearby incinerator plant for reference. Protesters also visited the nearby village of Likeng where villagers had been conducting protests against their own incinerator since 2000, and thus had first-hand experience living in close proximity to a waste-to-energy plant. Eventually concluding that the proposed plant would be detrimental to their community, protesters in Panyu began writing letters to government officials and later took to the streets to publicly express their concerns. On October 25, 2009, in one such case, protesters marched near a supermarket wearing surgical and gas masks and carrying signs depicting various anti-incinerator messages. These actions eventually resulted in the police being called in and some arrests being made. A month later, following the government's announcement of a public reception to discuss community issues, protesters mobilized via online blogs and social media sites and arrived at the event in such numbers that the venue was incapable of accommodating everyone present. Protesters in Pingwang similarly utilized the internet and various online bulletin boards to criticize their town's incinerator plant and mobilize protests against it. When online methods proved ineffective thousands residents took to the streets during October 2009 and occupied the planned incinerator facility for 2 days, leading to police being brought out and the protest being peacefully dispersed. In the village of Panguanying protesters began by making a series of appeals to local government officials. When their concerns were rebuffed protesters began visiting other nearby villages to ask for their support, and, using the Liulitun protest as reference, produced their own report articulating their discontent for the development of an incinerator. Eventually a group of protesters traveled to Beijing and sought the help of prominent environmental lawyers who in turn connected them with various environmental activist groups and assisted in having their case be heard in the Qiaoxi District People's Court. In cases such as Panguanying the role of media proved significant in bringing wider attention to the innately localized issue of the town's incinerator plant. Moreover, through connecting with the environmental NGO, Nature University, in Beijing, villagers were able to receive necessary educational and planning support. In more recent years protesters have utilized modern communications and social media services such as Twitter and WeChat to organize their efforts and share information.  Government response  Given the marked success of protests in places such as Beijing and Guangzhou, it can be observed that the government has been notably responsive to the anti-incinerator movement. While in many cases police were dispatched to break up any public demonstrations, local governments have ultimately acknowledged protesters‚Äô concerns and, in some cases, made such accommodations as canceling proposed incinerator projects or agreeing to relocate construction to less-populated areas. This can especially be seen in the case of Pingwang town, where the mass-mobilization of protesters forced the government to re-evaluate their initial dismissal of the residents' concerns. In cases such as the Panguanying protest, the local government responded first by assuring residents that pollution levels would not increase as a result of the proposed plant, though when protesters remained unswayed officials eventually relented and postponed the project. = Future developments = Despite various concessions having been made with regard to anti-incinerator protests, the Chinese government has maintained its commitment to waste-to- energy incinerators as a means to lessen the nation's ongoing waste burden. Following the cancellation of the Panyu plant in Guangzhou, the government, in a press conference during April 2012, affirmed its plans to build 4 new incinerators throughout the city to deal with growing amounts of municipal waste. Similarly, in Beijing, despite the success of the Liulitun protest, various incinerator plants have since been constructed, including the original Liulitun plant which was, in 2010, relocated to the nearby village of Dagong. Additionally, the national government has continued to implement various policies and initiatives to support incineration. Presently the number of waste incinerators operating in China has reached nearly 300 with 249 being in cities and 50 near small towns. Accordingly there are plans to increase this number to meet the state sponsored goal of having nearly one third of the nation's garbage disposed of via incineration by 2030.

Tompkinson told the Daily Mirror that he was keen to take on the more active role of Jim Harper, commenting; ‚ÄúI grabbed this project because I‚Äôd never been asked to do anything like this before, and the chance to do stunts was one reason it was so appealing. As soon as I read the script I knew there hadn‚Äôt been anything like this on British television for a very long time. It has elements of The 39 Steps running through it. It asks how an ordinary person manages to deal with a set of quite extraordinary events.‚Äù The series was released on Region 2 DVD on 24 May 2004. A reprint of Gallagher's novel with Tompkinson on the cover art followed on 2 January 2018. Production The series was initially written for the BBC, but after they declined to commission the project, the series was offered to ITV, who chose to commission it the following year. Whilst filming in the Swiss Alps, a number of crew members suffered from altitude sickness, which temporarily halted production. The series was intended for broadcast in February 1998, with a number of listings magazines including features on the series prior to broadcast; but due to changes in the ITV, the series did not transmit until early April. The series has since been repeated on ITV2.

Someone uses a delaying tactic when they expect to have a stronger negotiating position at a later time. They may also use a delaying tactic when they prefer the status quo to any of the potential resolutions, or to impose costs on the other party to compel them to accept a settlement or compromise. Delay tactics are also sometimes used as a form of indirect refusal wherein one party postpones a decision indefinitely rather than refusing a negotiation outright. To use a delaying tactic, the delaying party must have some form of control over the decision-making process.  Delaying tactics in psychology  Delaying tactics can be employed, either intentionally or subconsciously, as a coping mechanism to avoid making difficult decisions or performing unpleasant tasks.The reasons that an individual may use delay tactics may vary, but motivations often include maintaining control and avoiding change; especially when this change is unwanted. By delaying a decision, the individual avoids committing to a course of action that could lead to limited autonomy or feelings of loss of control. This kind of delay tactic is often seen as a fear of commitment, when an individual would rather remain undecided than to commit to any specific option available to them. A closely related phenomenon is opportunity cost, wherein an individual is unwilling to forgo other available options to commit to one.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asphttps://www.intercom.com/blog/action- vs- indecision/#:~:text=At%20best%2C%20it's%20an%20opportunity,the%20costs%20are%20greater%20still. Delay tactics can also be the result of denial if an individual is unwilling to accept any of the available options, especially when choosing between multiple negative outcomes.https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult- health/in-depth/denial/art-20047926 An individual may delay making a decision in the hope that a better option will become available or that the decision will be made for them by others or by changing circumstances. Delay tactics and indecision can be a symptom of mild to severe mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Delaying and indecision can also be the result of fear of making a poor choice. This can stem from an obsessive desire to identify the optimal solution by gathering more information. This can result in the decision being postponed indefinitely, especially in situations where some degree of uncertainty is unavoidable.https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context;=faculty_scholarship This can be further exacerbated if the individual has trauma associated with the consequences of their past decisions.https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/counseling- keys/201707/uncovering-hidden-causes-indecision = Delaying tactics survival value = Delaying tactics are a part of the body's natural response to perceived threats. Freezing is a primary instinctive survival response along with fight and flight Freezing is an automatic, involuntary response to fear. This tactic delays other responses, allowing for more time to process the situation and gather information before taking any action. Freezing may also occur when neither fight or flight is an available option. If there is no decision to make, freezing is not a delaying tactic.  Related negotiation tactics  * Active silence: The negotiator uses silence skillfully to induce a targeted discomfort in the other parties. The silence serves as a sign that the negotiator is confident and expects a response. * Bigger picture: The negotiator makes light of the proposed issue, and turns the focus to a wider discussion. *Bluff: The negotiator makes a false claim, as if he has better offers from other parties. *Bogeyman: The negotiator introduces a false threat or warning. * Changing the Negotiator: The negotiator is changed to reset the progression made thus far. *Control the Agenda: The negotiator controls the agenda, and the priorities to control what is discussed and when. *Discovery challenges: A negotiator stalls for time by claiming they had a hard time finding or doing what the other party asked for. *Divide and conquer: The negotiator creates an internal conflict between other, opposing parties. *Ellsberg paradox or also ambiguity aversion: The negotiator uses the human bias toward the option they know most about, regardless of its merits. * Empty Promises: The negotiator makes promises that they know they will not keep. *Feather ruffling: The negotiator utilizes personal attack to divert the discussion to the involved parties instead of the results. * Fragmentation: The negotiator breaks the discussion into minor discussions. * Introducing a new issue: The negotiator introduces a new issue during the negotiation for distraction. *Jurisdictional challenges: A delaying tactic in court in which another group prolongs the case by claiming it is their jurisdiction. * Late objections: The negotiator makes an objection late in the negotiation, to set it back to square one. * Limited Authority, Absent Authority or Missing person tactic: The negotiator declares their limited ability to make a decision, they also claim that the person who can make the decision is not available at the moment, drawing out the process. *Logrolling: The negotiator concedes on low- priority items to them. * Overwhelming: The negotiator provides other parties with too much requests or information to overload them. * Questioning goals: The negotiator debates the value of other parties' ultimate goals. * Phasing: The negotiator offers to phase in or out the requested changes, buying themselves more time. * Playing Dumb: The negotiator acts stupid to avoid confrontations. * Selective listening: The negotiator overlooks certain fragments of the other parties' argument hearing what they want to, rather than what is actually being said. *Taking something back: The negotiator offers something only to take it back later.  Examples  # A common type of delay tactic in politics is the filibuster, wherein a party attempts to prevent a vote on a proposed piece of legislation by prolonging the debate of that legislation indefinitely. # In Newcastle, England delay tactics are built into the criminal justice system. Police and prosecutors delayed charging suspects for crimes for up to four years waiting for sufficient evidence to release or convict them. The delay of prosecution could potentially lead to dangerous criminals being able to reenter the public while under investigation, making this a controversial use of delaying tactic. # In Queensland, Australia the Australian Conservative Foundation (ACF) is utilizing the legal system to delay projects that have already been approved on state and local levels. By running the proposed changes through the legal system over and over, the foundation is preventing environmental changes and development. This provides a legal way of conserving land, however, it also prevents economic development and change. # In England, politicians have accused the Secretary of State of improperly using delay tactics to stop compensation payments to abuse victims. The compensation has been delayed for two and half years, which has led to calls for resignation. Public pressure has drawn the declaration that compensation will be made, but the delay persists. # In the United States, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has been accused of using delay tactics to prevent lower-cost generic drugs from getting to the market. The FDA takes time to determine purpose and effectiveness of a drug so they can determine how to best train doctors on the risks and symptoms of the drugs. The misuse of the ‚Äúrisk evaluation and mitigation strategies‚Äù has disproportionately delayed lower-cost drugs from hitting the market. # Delay tactics are used by banks to make it difficult to change providers or move their money to a better, cheaper, alternative. This is done by making customers pass through a series of tedious legal hurdles and/or by drawing our the response time it takes to switch providers. The process is also sometimes delayed by using ambiguous and confusing language, which makes it harder for individuals to know what kind of service they will lose or gain.

F. Ying (; June 15, 1918 ‚Äì June 30, 2011) was a Chinese acoustical physicist who was the founder and pioneer of ultrasonics research in China., specializing in dispersion of ultrasonics in solids, ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers, ultrasonic propagation in soft tissues, power ultrasonics, laser ultrasound and acoustic cavitation. An academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Ying was a research professor at Institute of Acoustics (IOA) of CAS, inaugural Chairman of the Acoustical Society of China (ASC) and Editor-in-Chief of the academic journal Applied Acoustics.  Early life and education  Ying was born in 1918 in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China to a middle-class family. His father was an accountant working for a British firm in China. Ying grew up in Wuhan and was taught English since very young. In 1940, he graduated from the Christian missionary college Huachung University and received his master's degree from Physics Department of Tsinghua University in 1945. Ying went to the U.S. in 1948 with a scholarship of Huachung University. He studied electronics with Prof. H. E. Farnsworth in Brown University where he received the Ph.D. degree in 1951.  Career  In 1951, Ying started to work for Prof. Rohn Truell's Metals Research Laboratory of Brown University and co-authored with Prof. Truell a series of research papers. Three of them are regarded as laying the foundation for the later development of ultrasonics, according to the Institute of Acoustics of CAS and some researchers around the world: * \\"Complicated Domain Patterns on Iron‚ÄêSilicon Single Crystals\\", published in Journal of Applied Physics (Dec. 1952) * \\"The Effect of Hydrogen on Ultrasonic Attenuation and Velocity Measurements in Titanium\\", published in Acta Metallurgica (May 1954) * \\"Scattering of a Plane Longitudinal Wave by a Spherical Obstacle in an Isotropically Elastic Solid\\", published in Journal of Applied Physics (October 1956) In 1956, Ying came back to China and entered into the Chinese Academy of Sciences, served as researcher at Institute of Applied Physics; then in 1957, director of research at the Institute of Electronics; and then in 1964, director of research at the newly founded Institute of Acoustics. He dedicated himself in promoting the research and applications of ultrasonics in China despite the turbulences of the political movements beginning to overwhelm the Chinese society since early 1960s. During the Cultural Revolution(1966-1976), Ying was tortured, saw his liberty denied during 8 months and once attempted suicide in 1968, while his first spouse died of cancer in a camp in southern China. Ying was appointed the deputy director of the Institute of Acoustics in 1978 when the IOA was reconstituted in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution. From 1978 to his death in 2011, Ying made numerous breakthroughs in research, education, and was granted national awards for 4 times by the Chinese government. He has also multiplied the international interactions in the fields of ultrasonics with researchers from western countries. In 1980, he was named overseas editor by the British scientific journal \\"Ultrasonics\\" and American \\"Wave Motion\\". In 1990, Ying published another influential research paper \\"Photoelastic Visualization and Theoretical Analyses of Scatterings of Ultrasonic Pulses in Solids\\" in the scientific journal Physical Acoustics and a 600-page treatise in Chinese entitled Ultrasonics. In October 1993, Ying was elected academician of CAS. Ying dedicated the last decade of his life to the research of acoustic cavitation, in which China considered itself lagged behind.

Biography Bonham attended Wimbledon High School in London growing up, but would go on to spend most of her lifetime in the countryside. Bonham was married three times. Her first marriage, to Walter Griffith, ended \\"disastrously\\" when she was \\"very young\\". Her second marriage was to Deryck Bazalgette, the great-grandson of Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The two met when they both attended the Peace Pledge Union, a pacifist, anti-war organization and as conscientious objectors established a commune in Devon. Bonham gave birth to two children, Cary and Charles. They divorced after the Second World War. After her divorce from Bazalgette, she married Sir Charles Kimber, 3rd Baronet, another conscientious objector who ran a Devon market garden. Bonham and Kimber met when the secretary of the Labour Party in Totnes was canvassing Devon. The two were said to have shared a love of \\"rally driving and good living\\" and lived on \\"a covered lifeboat on Port Meadow, Oxford\\". Kimber succeeded to his baronetcy in 1950 and the two moved into a large home in Oxfordshire. The couple had a son and daughter before divorcing in the early 1960s. After Bonham's third marriage ended in divorce, she moved again to Devon where she remained for the rest of her life. After the death of her and Kimber's son in a car crash, she stopped writing. Writing Bonham published the majority of her short- stories in magazines, and had written more than 80 in her lifetime. Fifteen were collected and published as The Casino, her most prominent work. In her 1949 New York Times review, Hilda Lake writes of The Casino, \\"This slight volume of entertaining short stories from England reminds us once more that no other nation has mastered the art of soft-pedaled social satire quite as the English have. Miss Bonham's 'Edwardian shadows,' her passionless sluts, deluded spinsters and stodgy practitioners of planned parenthood are always on the verge of being badgered.\\" Bonham's mystery novel The House Across the River was met with positive reviews, with Vernon Fane of The Sphere calling it 'the work of a trained and unromantic mind which plays with thoughts as other writers play with words.'Fane, Vernon.

Her art mainly focuses on the themes of female identity, self esteem in the 21st century and the portrayal of women in their bedrooms. Nor states that she is inspired by her own experiences as a woman, her struggles with depression, technology, and the average, modern day woman. She works in a multitude of mediums, including print and sculpture, to create her unconventional style. She grew up drawing and received a degree in illustration from Loughborough University.  Career  According to Niloufar Haidari, Nor's satirical and humorous look into female sexuality and its demons led to her rise in popularity. Her art has become famous on social media and she has worked with Gucci, Andy Baker and Chelou for the music video ‚ÄúHalfway to Nowhere‚Äù, Dazed Digital, Dr Martens, and Complex magazine. She was also a guest speaker for The Apple Store hosted by Dazed Magazine. She is currently working on illustrating a book for Bloomsbury Publishing and debuting her next exhibition through Red Bull Studios London.  Works  Nor initially became popular online and her work has been shown in multiple art galleries. As a part of the Association of Illustrators, she has produced various shows including ‚ÄúSorry Grandma: An Exhibition of Obscene Illustrations‚Äù at 71a Gallery in 2015 and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Called Art Mum, Look it Up‚Äù and ‚ÄúAiring My Dirty Laundry In Public‚Äù at Protein Studios in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Kirwan House and Store is a living museum located south of the village of Chester on Kent Island, Queen Anne's County, Maryland. It served as a general store, lumber mill, cooper's mill, and blacksmith shop between 1889 and 1955 and facilitated local trade as a port on Kirwan Creek. The estate was donated to the Kent Island Heritage Society in 1998 to be run as a museum. History James E. Kirwan (1848-1938) was born in Baltimore and served in the Maryland oyster navy, which patrolled the Chesapeake Bay to prevent illegal oyster dredging. Kirwan married Mary Rebecca Gardner in 1867 and settled in Queen Anne's County. The couple had three children: Charles (born 1868), Sophia Lavinia (born 1870) and Lemuel (born 1872). Kirwan appears on Lake, Griffing, & Stevenson's 1877 Map of Queen Anne's County as the owner of a residence and store on the west side of what is now Dominion Road. Although advertised as a Stevensville business, Kirwan's store was strategically located between the village of Chester (then called Sharktown) and the fishing community of Dominion. Local tradition holds that in 1889, Johnstown floodwaters washed vast quantities of lumber into the Chesapeake Bay and onto the shores of Kent Island. Kirwan is said to have bought the lumber to construct the current store on the east side of Dominion Road. The complex stands on of agricultural preserve and is defined by a picket fence on the west, a road trace leading to Kirwan Creek on the north, a grassy field on the east, and a hedge on the south. The centerpiece of the complex is a ca. 1889 2 testacy, 5-bay, wood-frame I-house with an attached 2-story, 3-bay, wood- frame, front-gable store. A ca. 1889 wood-frame dairy stands immediately east of the house. Also present are a wood-frame pump house, two wood-frame sheds, a concrete fountain, and concrete garden pavers and wall remnants, all dating to the 1940s. Significance The James E. Kirwan House and Store is a historic structure on Kent Island registered with the Maryland Historical Trust and is the only preserved example of a 19th-century general store and farm site on Kent Island. Its self-sufficient facilities, extensive merchandise and seafaring trade showcase the economic isolation of the Eastern Shore of Maryland prior to the construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Through its educational mission, the Kent Island Heritage Society now opens its sites (including Kirwan House, Stevensville Bank and Cray House) to the public monthly where Society docents provide guided tours.

These soils develop through the establishment of beneficial microbes, known as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the rhizosphere of plant roots. These mutualistic microbes function to increase plant health by fighting against harmful soil microbes either directly or indirectly. As beneficial bacteria occupy space around plant roots they outcompete harmful pathogens by releasing pathogenic suppressive metabolites.  PGPR and harmful soil microbes  Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria are bacteria that promote plant growth, through fixing nitrogen, producing growth hormones, or even suppressing pathogens.Babalola, O. O. (2010). Beneficial bacteria of agricultural importance. Biotechnology Letters, 32(11), 1559-1570. doi:10.1007/s10529-010-0347-0 A variety of PGPR genera provide a wide array of functions that directly improve plant health. Bacteria genera Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium work to fix nitrogen into a usable form.Terpolilli, J. J., Hood, G. A., & Poole, P. S. (2012). What determines the efficiency of N2-fixing Rhizobium-legume symbioses?. In Advances in microbial physiology (Vol. 60, pp. 325-389). Academic Press. Actinomyces and Azospirillum produce growth hormones that increase root growth and uptake of nutrients.Somers, E., Vanderleyden, J., & Srinivasan, M. (2004). Rhizosphere bacterial signalling: a love parade beneath our feet. Critical reviews in microbiology, 30(4), 205-240. While many of these genera increase plant health directly some PGPR promote plant health indirectly through pathogen suppression.Raaijmakers, J. M., Paulitz, T. C., Steinberg, C., Alabouvette, C., & Mo√´nne-Loccoz, Y. (2009). The rhizosphere: a playground and battlefield for soilborne pathogens and beneficial microorganisms. Plant and soil, 321(1-2), 341-361. Pathogenic fungi create a complex of hyphae that migrate through the soil. When these fungi reach the rhizosphere they release enzymes that degrade the cell wall of plant root cells. This allows them to enter and infect the host plant and prevent the uptake of nutrients. Beneficial Pseudomonas and Bacillus produce fungal suppressing metabolites that break up this migrating fungal hyphae. Over time, plants are able to create disease- suppressive soils in response to these pathogens through the increasing the abundance of these PGPR in their rhizosphere area.  Establishment of suppressive soils  Plants respond to pathogens by recruiting PGPR to their root rhizosphere from the bulk soil to fill in and prevent pathogen establishment. This ultimately leads to the development of disease-suppressive soils. PGPR are recruited through the natural release plant exudates from root cells as they push through the soil.Lynch, J. M., & Whipps, J. M. (1990). Substrate flow in the rhizosphere. Plant and soil, 129(1), 1-10. Different species of plants release different exudates and therefore recruit different microbial communities to their rhizosphere from the microbes already present in the surrounding bulk soil.Bakker, M. G., Chaparro, J. M., Manter, D. K., & Vivanco, J. M. (2015). Impacts of bulk soil microbial community structure on rhizosphere microbiomes of Zea mays. Plant and Soil, 392(1-2), 115-126. If a beneficial microbe genera is not present in a soil plants are not able to recruit it as a defense. Therefore, suppressive soils are a function of the microbes already present in a soil and able to be recruited. The creation of these soils must be done by increasing PGPR in the overall bulk soil. Specific plants are able to recruit beneficial bacteria through the secretion of different root exudates.Bakker, M. G., Manter, D. K., Sheflin, A. M., Weir, T. L., & Vivanco, J. M. (2012). Harnessing the rhizosphere microbiome through plant breeding and agricultural management. Plant and Soil, 360(1-2), 1-13. A greater diversity of plants in a soil leads to a greater diversity of microbes in the rhizosphere and furthermore can lead to greater suppression of soil diseases.Latz, E., Eisenhauer, N., Rall, B.

The company was founded in 2012 by Jennifer Zuccarini with a goal to change the way women approach to lingerie, by creating lingerie that could be worn every day. In 2017, Fleur de Mal opened a boutique in SOHO, New York City. Also, from September 2018 to February 2019, Fleur du mal had another pop-up in Los Angeles, California.  Background  Fleur du Mal is a ready-to-wear and lingerie brand, founded by Jennifer Zuccarini in late 2012. Zuccarini grew up in Toronto, Canada and later moved to New York, where she has lived for almost 14 years. She has stated that her mother inspired her to get into the fashion field. She studied Fine Arts in Montreal, after which she completed another degree in Fashion Design at Fashion Institute of Technology. During this time, Zuccarini began working at the online store Nanette Lepore, where she forecast trends. She met her boyfriend at Nanette Lepore and the two began to plan a new business, Kiki de Montparnasse, which they founded in 2005. After 3 years, Zuccarini moved on to Victoria's Secret in 2008, where she worked as a lingerie designer. Zuccarini's father, who was an entrepreneur, convinced Zuccarini to create her own business. As she had work experiences at Kiki and Victoria's Secret, Zuccarini chose lingerie fashion. She created Fleur du Mal, a lingerie brand having her own styles meant to be worn everyday. Zuccarini took the name from a collection of poems by Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal (\\"the flowers of evil\\"). Zuccarini felt that Baudelaire was a good inspiration for the brand, as he was a \\"decadent and tormented artist, a true dandy, who spent everything he had on clothing, opium and women\\". The primary goal for Zuccarini was to change people's views towards lingerie, as Zuccarini felt that lingerie played an important role as a part of women's wardrobe and should not be limited to special events such as a date. Zuccarini wanted to empower women to know they can be powerful and sexy. In 2017 Fleur du Mal launched a read-to-wear label. During the same year the newspaper Observer stated that Fleur du Mal had become Hollywood's go-to lingerie line. In 2019 The Independent named the brand one of the \\"65 best online clothing stores in the US\\".  Products  As of 2019, Fleur du Mal offers lingerie, women's ready-to-wear fashion, and swims. The brand has offered special collections including \\"ESSENTIELS\\", \\"SPRING\\", \\"RESORT\\", \\"BRIDAL\\", and \\"BACK IN STOCK\\". From 2015 to 2018, Fleur du Mal launched a number of conceptual collections. # ‚ÄòLove is a contact sport‚Äô was the first lingerie collection released on spring 2015. # 'Do not disturb' was the second collection launched in fall 2015. # ‚ÄòFleur du Mal X Playboy was a collaboration of 17 products including bras and panties sets, body suits, robes and bunny ears, available in various colors, prints and fabrics. The collections was launched on November 20, 2015. # 'The velvet underground' was released in the fall of 2016. The concept of this collection was to crush on everything velvet for fall. # 'Tropical disco hustle' was a collection released on 2017 for vocation. 'Baby, it is getting hot' was the main thesis of this collection. #In 2018, the brand launched their Fuller Cup collection, ranging from size DD to G. # 'Spring fever' was launched on spring 2019. The concept of the collection is to make a connection with lingerie and flowers.  Marketing and Collaboration  Jennifer Zuccarini chose to utilize mobile pop-up shops, as she felt that they model the modern customers' shopping habits and allows the company to expand its international presence quicker that only holding specific physical stores. Fleur du Mal launched its first mobile pop-up shop in New York in November 2012 and also hosted another one in Los Angeles in February 2013. Fleur du Mal partnered with Playboy in 2015. The entire collaboration had 17 products including bras and panties sets, body suits, robes and bunny ears, available in various colors, prints and fabrics with a Playboy touch. Products could be purchased online at diverse retailers like Shopbob, Fleur du Mal, and Net-a- Porter. In June 2017, Fleur du Mal launched a year-round gallery \\"The Peep Show\\", located inside the NYC boutique at 175 Mott Street. The exhibition featured artist Fahren Feingold and carried the label's full fall 2017 collection. Zuccarini claimed that it's important to collaborate with artists who really understand the essence of Fleur du Mal: powerful, provocative and feminine. In November 2017, the perfume brand Kilian collaborated with Fleur du Mal. The concept of this collaboration was to use microcapsules to bring Kilian's fragrance to underwear items. This collection included a semi- transparent bodysuit, a night sets including a camisole and shorts, a kimono, and accessories sets.

Landscape genetics is the scientific discipline that combines population genetics and landscape ecology. It broadly encompasses any study that analyses plant or animal population genetic data in conjunction with data on the landscape features and matrix quality where the sampled population lives. This allows for the analysis of microevolutionary processes affecting the species in light of landscape spatial patterns, providing a more realistic view of how populations interact with their environments. Landscape genetics attempts to determine which landscape features are barriers to dispersal and gene flow, how human-induced landscape changes affect the evolution of populations, the source-sink dynamics of a given population, and how diseases or invasive species spread across landscapes. Landscape genetics differs from the fields of biogeography and phylogeography by providing information at finer temporal and spatial scales (i.e., at the level of individual genetic variation within a population). Because it focuses on sampling individuals, landscape genetics has the advantage of not having to subjectively define discrete populations prior to analysis. Genetic tools are used to detect abrupt genetic differences between individuals within a population and statistical tools are used to correlate these genetic discontinuities with landscape and environmental features. The results of landscape genetics studies have potentially important applications to conservation biology and land management practices.  History  Landscape genetics emerged as its own discipline after the seminal article entitled \\"Landscape genetics: combining landscape ecology and population genetics\\" by Manel et al. appeared in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution in 2003. According to that article, the concept that landscape patterns affect how organisms are distributed dates back to the 18th and 19th centuries in the writings of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and Alfred Russel Wallace. The modern field is interdisciplinary and integrates not only population genetics and landscape ecology, but also the field of spatial statistics. As of 2008, over 655 articles had been published in the field in a variety of genetics and ecological journals. Map of the McArthur Lake Wildlife Corridor in northern Idaho, United States. It links to adjacent wilderness areas.  Advances and applications  Landscape genetics has advanced ecological and evolutionary theory by facilitating an understanding of how gene flow and adaptation occur in real heterogeneous landscapes. It has also allowed for the estimation of functional connectivity across landscapes. Elucidating landscape features that act as barriers or facilitators of dispersal can inform the construction or preservation of wildlife corridors that connect fragmented landscapes. Landscape genetics can also help predict how diseases will spread across a landscape or how proposed management actions will affect populations. Finally, landscape genetics can help predict how well populations will adapt to continuing global change.  Methods  = Genetic markers = Molecular markers of genetic diversity such as DNA microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphisms, and alloenzymes are tested in random individuals of a particular species across a landscape. These markers are used to determine the genotype (genetic make-up) of the individuals tested. = Landscape and environmental features = Landscape features include landscape composition (abundance and variety of patch types), landscape configuration (how these patches are arranged in space), and the quality of the matrix (the space in a landscape between patches of habitat for a given species). Topography, altitude, habitat types, and potential barriers such as rivers or road are examples of landscape variables. = Statistical tools =  Identifying genetic patterns  Various statistical tools are utilized to identify genetic patterns from the genetic markers collected. Methods that cluster individuals into subpopulations based on genetic differentiation or distance, such fixation index (FST) and Bayesian assignment methods, are often used. However, because individuals are sometimes evenly distributed rather than spatially clustered across a landscape, these methods are limited and alternative methods are being developed.  Correlating genetic patterns to landscape  Statistical tools such as the Mantel test or partial Mantel test are commonly used to correlate genetic patterns with landscape features. Linear regression models and ordination techniques are also common. Geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to visualize genetic patterns across space by plotting genetic data on a map of the landscape. White tail deer  Example  A study published in 2012 analyzed the landscape genetics of white tail deer in Wisconsin and Illinois. They extracted DNA from the lymph nodes of 2,069 harvested deer across 64 townships. Fifteen microsatellite markers were used for genotyping. A Bayesian population assignment test found no distinct subpopulations based on the genetic data. Correlograms were used to elucidate fine-scale social structure, and found that more heavily forested and fragmented townships had more genetic relatedness between individual deer. Spatial principal component analysis was used to elucidate broad-scale population connectivity. Partial Mantel tests found a correlation between genetic distance and geographic barriers, particularly roads and rivers. However, these were not absolute barriers and did not divide the deer into distinct subpopulations. The finding of high genetic connectivity among the sampled deer has management implications for the setting of harvest number and population goals. The finding of high genetic connectivity also has implications for the spread of chronic wasting disease among deer.  Sub- disciplines  =Seascape genetics= Most landscape genetics studies have focused on terrestrial systems. Seascape genetics borrows from the methods of landscape genetics, but applies them to marine systems, taking seascape ecology variables such as current and water temperature into account. =Landscape genomics= Landscape genomics also correlates genetic data with landscape data, but the genetic data comes from multiple loci (locations on a chromosome) across the genome of the organism, as in population genomics. Landscape genetics typically measures less than a dozen different microsatellites in an organism, while landscape genomics often measures single nucleotide polymorphisms at thousands of loci. This allows for the identification of outlier loci that may be under selection. Correlation to landscape data allows for identification of landscape factors contributing to genetic adaptation. This field is growing due to advances in next-generation sequencing techniques.  Pitfalls  As a new and fast growing interdisciplinary field with no explicitly identified best practices, it has been subject to a number of flaws in both study design and interpretation. A 2016 publication identified four common pitfalls of landscape genetics research that should be targeted for correction. These include assuming gene flow is always advantageous, over-generalizing results, failing to consider other processes that affect the genetic structure of populations, and mistaking quantitative methods for robust study design. In particular, authors have been encouraged to report their sampling design, reproducibility of molecular data, and details on the spatial data set and spatial analyses utilized. Because the effects of landscape on gene flow are not universal, sweeping generalities cannot be made, and species-specific studies are necessary. Many of these pitfalls result from the interdisciplinary nature of landscape genetics, and could be avoided with better collaboration among specialists in the fields of population genetics, landscape ecology, spatial statistics, and geography.

Symmorphosis is when a quantitative match of design and function within an organism defined within a functional system. Symmorphosis can be broken down into the three predictions that are required for organs to evolve within a species. This proposes that if organs were matched structurally and functionally, and paired with the correct energy and minerals, the body would create an organ of optimal design. Some examples of this in the human body could be how the respiratory system distributes oxygen, how bones are structured to withstand stress, how blood vessels are designed to distribute blood throughout the body without using a lot of energy, or even how as a person becomes more physically fit or endures more cardio after their body has adjusted to maintain higher functioning demands. The use of symmorphosis can allow for fields of science to work with the field of evolutionary biology to better understand adaptation.  Requirements  For symmorphosis to occur, there must be three predictions or guidelines in place and functioning at the same time. These three predictions work together to let an organ function or organ system work at full potential. = Structure = When looking at the theory of symmorphosis, one must consider if the design in the organism is fully optimized. The structural design in terms of symmorphosis means that the organ is designed to allow full capacity of its function and can allow for adjustments to occur when necessary. This design must contain the sufficient amount of economy material for the organ needed. In this circumstance, economy material is the careful management of resources such as tissues. = Capacity = The functional capacity is when all functional units work together to determine the maximal capacity. Functional capacity is overall determined by the structural design. Once the design is optimized in terms of biological materials, then the structure must be taken into account. The structure of an organ determines the maximal functional capacity and the adjustments required for morphogenesis‚Äîthe process that causes an organism to create its shape‚Äîto occur. = Performance = The third prediction states that if prediction two works in intermediate steps to create a function of an individual organ, then each step also helps create the upper limit of the function.\\" This means that if multiple units work together in multiple steps, they function together to create an upper limit (e.g., Vo2max) in terms of function or ability.  Within the respiratory system  A common form of testing symmorphosis between species of mammals is to use comparative biology. The first system to use the proposed theory for symmorphosis is the oxygen pathway for mammals. The original experimental method for symmorphosis was used to show if the design of the organs were relative to the static demands of the mammalian respiratory system. The respiratory system is a good example to study because it has one main function, the function has a measurable limit, the limit is variable, it has a sequence of structure, and each step of the sequence has functional parameters that are not fixed. A common pathway within the respiratory system is the oxygen pathway. This pathway is used because it is a good representation for mammals within most species‚Äîbecause it involves several organs that link together, and the overall function has a measurable upper limit. In particular, this testing helps identify structural elements that differ so they can carry the maximum amount of oxygen throughout the body. = Vo2max = The upper limit for the oxygen pathway is called the Vo2max. Vo2max is the maximal oxygen capacity that systems can take in, transport, and use oxygen. Vo2max can vary among individuals due to allometric variation (the differences in body mass) , adaptive variation (differences in lifestyles) , and the induced variation (amount of cardio exercise). Variation of any of the three types of variation should lead researchers to expect different parameters. The oxygen cascade is one system with clear limits, and can help determine the Vo2max by components such as oxygen supply to the skeletal muscle mitochondria and the demand of oxygen by these skeletal muscle mitochondria. If oxygen is not transferred via skeletal muscle mitochondria, it can them be transferred across muscle capillaries.  Evolutionary implications  Symmophsis can be use as an analytical advancement that helps other fields of science‚Äîsuch as biochemistry, physiology, and astronomy‚Äîwork with fields such as cell, molecular, and evolutionary biology. Combining these fields helps researchers better understand past biological adaptions. In evolution, natural selection can hinder the design when looking at the guidelines for symmorphosis. Natural selection can alter the phenotype to increase fitness of a species. In doing this, natural selection can cause adaptations that can change the optimal structural. When the optimal structural design changes, it changes the amount of economy material that must be used, which changes the predictions.  Critiques  An issue with symmorphosis is the problem of having an optimal design for an organ if the organ contains multiple functions. An organ that performs multiple functions must compromise optimal performance of one function to perform another another optimally. These complex components adding together dramatically decreases the chance that everything will optimally match. An example of this in mammals is the lungs. Researchers now claim that the lungs are an exception when considering the Lungs typically are only partially adjusted to maximal oxygen capacity in terms of adaptive and allometric variation and cause a fluctuation in these values. In terms of symmorphosis, the capacity of each step of the oxygen cascade should match the demand of Vmax. In most cases this theory holds true with the exception of when an individual exceeds the Vmax. When Vmax is exceeded there then becomes developmental constraints as well as design constraints in terms of symmorphosis. When this occurs there is an unmatched capacity, although they maybe similar they do not aline with the predictions for symmorphosis.

Arabidopsis thaliana is a small flowering land plant in the family Brassicaceae, which is utilized as a model organism for genetic studies. While the plant's genomics are well understood, little is known about sexual selection processes and sex-biased genes in this species. It has been found that these genes associate with the sexually dimorphic traits of males and females, considering that both sexes of a species will have very similar genomes. These genes are preferentially expressed in the different sexes within a species, and tend to provide an accelerated rate of evolution resulting from a specific sex expressing the optimum phenotype to maximize fitness. A. thaliana is a self-fertilizing plant without sex chromosomes that is capable of utilizing sex-biased genes to potentially aid in adaptive evolution. There is little knowledge on how sex- biased genes function in A. thaliana's genome.  Arabidopsis thaliana  A. thaliana was discovered in the Harz Mountains in the 1500s with a native range that stretches on rough terrain across Eurasia, but has also established in North America as well. A. thaliana was identified as a model organism for genomic studies due to its small genome,consisting of only 5 chromosomes. A. thaliana has a relatively short life cycle, only taking approximately 5 weeks to reach full maturity after germination. This short life cycle makes it an ideal candidate as a model organism for genomic studies.  Sex-biased genes  Sex-biased genes are genes with expression exclusive to one sex and provide a potential means of rapid evolution in a species. = Variation between sexes = Male and female sex-biased genes of A. thaliana have major differences in expression and function. Male genes expressed in the pollen tube regions of the plant struggle in the initiation of protein evolution. This is the result of newly developed mutations being acted upon by positive selection. Female gametophytes differ significantly in their utilized number of sexually expressed genes compared to males. When looking at both types of gametophytes, both males and females shared approximately 20 genes that are expressed in similar fashion. It has also been found that 925 genes in A. thaliana are associated with the male gametophyte, consisting of those linked to sperm cells, pollen, and pollen tubes. On the other hand, approximately 196 genes have been identified to associate with the female gametophyte. = Function = The genes identified in the tissues of A. thaliana were able to be separated out and categorized based on location and function for both male and female reproductive organs. The male reproductive organs of the plant are much easier to be utilized for experimental procedures due to their capability to be easily isolated from the plant compared to the female organs. The genes that have been linked to pollen and pollen production show strong co- expression due to their classification as duplicated genes across various tissues. It has been identified that genes associated with pollen and the pollen tubes have a relatively high number of expressed polymorphisms through purifying selection. Identifiable features of adaptive evolution expressed in pollen associated genes are comparable to the increased levels of adaptive evolution in other comparable species. With adaptation regulated by mutation rates, the sex-biased genes associated with the male organs of the plant could show higher adaptation rates due to their presence being in a haploid state. In this haploid state, mutations are directly exposed to the opportunity of rapid selection. Pollen interactions associated with sporophytic tissue are not expressed in genes linked to female reproductive organs. The mechanisms involved in pollen formation and development of the pollen tube are important for pollen selection as well as protein composition of the pollen. Pollen surface proteins are produced in the sporophytic tissue of the anther and have expressed higher levels of purified selection with an increase in adaptive evolution from the oleopollenins of the anther.  Pollination mechanisms  A. thaliana is a self-pollinating plant compared to other closely related species, meaning it does not require pollen from other plants for fertilization. Self-pollination provides an effective means for plants to colonize new habitats effectively because they do not rely on pollen from another member of their species. By carrying both male and female reproductive organs, the effort for sexual reproduction is greatly diminished but comes at a cost. = Reduction of self-pollination = The implementation of self- pollination significantly reduces genetic variation in a population, and an established population of identical progeny presents limited opportunity for evolution on a genomic level throughout a species. The plant combats this through the utilization of both male and female sex organs which provides an environment with low rates of outcrossing through sex-biased genes. The result of low genetic variations in both A. thaliana gametophytes self-fertilization comes from the low rates of outcrossing. The low rates of outcrossing can be overcome by variations of heterogeneity in selection. This can happen based on the rare occurrence of outcrossing, which in A. thaliana, only occurs in the wild about 1% of the time. It has been found that rare occurrences of outcrossing can be as high as 15% in a given population. Researchers believe that even the 1% of occurrence is high enough of a rate to initiate genetic consistencies that can associate with sexual selection in A. thaliana. = Pollen competition = The presence of pollen competition when outcrossing occurs in a plant that utilizes self-fertilization allows recognition and selection of different pollen grains to fertilize the ovule. A. thaliana is closely related to Arabidopsis lyrata being that one diverged from the other through speciation. Although speciation has separated these species, they are still capable of providing a means of outcrossing between each other, initiating pollen competition within the plant. Although competition does occur among male gametophytes of both species, A. lyrata has very low instances of adaptive evolution compared to A. thaliana. This evidence is usually not the case in the instance of pollen competition across similar species, which generally results in increased rates of outcrossing. When outcrossing occurs generally there are much higher rates of genetic variation in progeny. There is little data on A. lyrata which results in little knowledge of whole genome polymorphisms.  Pollen associated gene interaction  It was determined that interactions associated between sporophytic tissue and pollen is exclusively expressed in the male gene sets. Therefore, the evidence suggests the importance of these interactions for understanding pollen selection by the plant. Other potential factors that play a role in pollen selection could be secreted pollen proteins, as well as protein composition. With major identified differences of pollen associated genes compared to other reproductive tissues, they can potentially be the underlying mechanisms correlated with sexual selection occurring during the prezygotic stage of pollination. This underlies the correlation between how selective pressure through the interactions between pollen grains as well as pollen tube formation provide an example of established sexual selection. A. thaliana provides an effective means to understand how even organisms that may appear limited in genetic variation based on reproductive strategies can still maintain a means of evolution through sex-biased genes and sexual selection through outcrossing.

Examples of hybrids include mules and ligers from the animal world, and subspecies of the Asian rice crop Oryza sativa from the plant world. Multiple models have been developed to explain this phenomenon. Recent research suggests that the source of this incompatibility is largely genetic, as combinations of genes and alleles prove lethal to the hybrid organism. Incompatibility is not solely influenced by genetics, however, and can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature. The genetic underpinnings of hybrid incompatibility may provide insight into factors responsible for evolutionary divergence between species.  Background  Hybrid incompatibility occurs when the offspring of two closely related species are not viable or suffer from infertility. Charles Darwin posited that hybrid incompatibility is not a product of natural selection, stating that the phenomenon is an outcome of the hybridizing species diverging, rather than something that is directly acted upon by selective pressures. The underlying causes of the incompatibility can be varied: earlier research focused on things like changes in ploidy in plants. More recent research has taken advantage of improved molecular techniques and has focused on the effects of genes and alleles in the hybrid and its parents. = Dobzhansky-Muller model = The first major breakthrough in the genetic basis of hybrid incompatibility is the Dobzhansky-Muller model, a combination of findings by Theodosius Dobzhansky and Joseph Muller between 1937 and 1942. The model provides an explanation as to why a negative fitness effect like hybrid incompatibility is not selected against. By hypothesizing that the incompatibility arose from alterations at two or more loci, rather than one, the incompatible alleles are in one hybrid individual for the first time rather than throughout the population - thus, hybrids that are infertile can develop while the parent populations remain viable. The negative fitness effects of infertility are not present in the original population. In this way, hybrid infertility contributes in some part to speciation by ensuring that gene flow between diverging species remains limited. Further analysis of the issue has supported this model, although it does not include conspecific genic interactions, an potential factor that more recent research has begun to look in to. = Gene identification = Decades after the research of Dobzhansky and Muller, the specifics of hybrid incompatibility were explored by Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr. Using introgression techniques to analyze the fertility in Drosophila hybrid and non-hybrid offspring, specific genes that contribute to sterility were identified; a study by Chung-I Wu which expanded on Coyne and Orr's work found that the hybrids of two Drosophila species were made sterile by the interaction of around 100 genes. These studies widened the scope of the Dobzhansky-Muller model, who thought it likely that more than two genes would be responsible. The ubiquity of Drosophila as a model organism has allowed many of the sterility genes to be sequenced in the years since Wu's study.  Modern directions  With modern molecular techniques, researchers have been able to more accurately identify the underlying genetic causes of hybrid incompatibility. This has led to both the development of expansions to the Dobzhansky-Muller model. Recent research has also explored the possibility of external influences on sterility as well. = The \\"snowball effect\\" = An extension of the Dobzhansky-Muller model is the \\"snowball effect\\"; an accumulation of incompatible loci due to increased species divergence. Since the model posits that sterility is due to negative allelic interaction between the hybridizing species, as species become more diverged it follows that more negative interactions should develop. The snowball effect states that the number of these incompatibilities will increase exponentially over the time of divergence, particularly when more than two loci contribute to the incompatibility. This concept has been exhibited in tests with the flowering plant genus Solanum, with the findings supporting the genetic underpinnings of Dobzhansky-Muller: > \\"Overall, our results indicate that the accumulation of sterility loci > follows a different trajectory from the accumulation of loci for other > quantitative species differences, consistent with the unique genetic basis > expected to underpin species reproductive isolating barriers. ...In doing > so, we uncover direct empirical support for the Dobzhansky-Muller model of > hybrid incompatibility, and the snowball prediction in particular.\\" = Environmental influences = Though the primary causes of hybrid incompatibility appear to be genetic, external factors may play a role as well. Studies focused primarily on model plants have found that the viability of hybrids can be dependent on environmental influence. Several studies on rice and Arabidopsis species identify temperature as an important factor in hybrid viability; generally, low temperatures seem to cause negative hybrid symptoms to be expressed while high temperatures suppress them, although one rice study found the opposite to be true. There has also been evidence in an Arabidopsis species that in poor environmental conditions (in this case, high temperatures), hybrids did not express negative symptoms and are viable with other populations. When environmental conditions return to normal, however, the negative symptoms are expressed and the hybrids are once again incompatible with other populations. = Lynch-Force model = Though a multitude of evidence supports the Dobzhansky-Muller model of hybrid sterility and speciation, this does not rule out the possibility that other situations besides the inviable combination of benign genes can lead to hybrid incompatibility. One such situation is incompatibility by way of gene duplication, or the Lynch and Force model (put forth by Michael Lynch and Allan Force in 2000). When gene duplication occurs, there is a possibility that a redundant gene can be rendered non-functional over time by mutations. From Lynch and Force's paper: > \\"The divergent resolution of genomic redundancies, such that one population > loses function from one copy while the second population loses function from > a second copy at a different chromosomal location, leads to chromosomal > repatterning such that gametes produced by hybrid individuals can be > completely lacking in functional genes for a duplicate pair.\\" This hypothesis is relatively recent compared to Dobzhansky-Muller, but has support as well. = Epigenetic influences = A possible contributor to hybrid incompatibility that fits with the Lynch and Force model better than the Dobzhansky-Muller model is epigenetic inheritance. Epigenetics broadly refers to heritable elements that affect offspring phenotype without adjusting the DNA sequence of the offspring. When a particular allele has been epigenetically modified, it is referred to as an epiallele A study found that an Arabidopsis gene is not expressed because it is a silent epiallele, and when this epiallele is inherited by hybrids in combination with a mutant gene at the same locus, the hybrid is inviable. This fits with the Lynch and Force model because the heritable epiallele, ordinarily not an issue in non-hybrid populations with non-epiallele copies of the gene, becomes problematic when it is the only copy of the gene in the hybrid population.

This process may be genetic, taxonomic, or functional, and it leads to a loss of beta (Œ≤) diversity. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"taxonomic homogenization\\", \\"functional homogenization\\", and \\"genetic homogenization\\", biotic homogenization is actually an overarching concept that encompasses the other three. This phenomenon stems primarily from two sources: extinctions of native and invasions of nonnative species. While this process pre-dates human civilization, as evidenced by the fossil record, and still occurs due to natural impacts, it has recently been accelerated due anthropogenic pressures. Biotic homogenization has become recognized as a significant component of the biodiversity crisis, and as such has become of increasing importance to conservation ecologists.  Overview  = Homogenization versus differentiation = Homogenization is the process of assemblages becoming increasingly similar: the reverse is the process of assemblages becoming increasingly different over time, a process known as \\"biotic differentiation\\". Just as biotic homogenization has genetic, taxonomic, and functional components, differentiation can occur at any of these levels of organization. = Alpha and beta diversity = alt= Understanding homogenization requires an understanding of the difference between alpha (Œ±) and beta (Œ≤) diversity. Alpha diversity refers to diversity within a community: it addresses how many species are present. A community with high Œ± diversity has many species present. Beta diversity compares multiple communities. For there to be high Œ≤ diversity, two communities would have to have high Œ± diversity but have different, unique species compositions. = Species introduction, extinction, and richness = When organisms are introduced to a habitat, be it naturally or artificially, overall species richness increases (assuming no other species are simultaneously lost). Similarly, when species become extinct, species richness decreases, once again assuming no other alterations to the assemblage. As such, when there is net increase in species richness, a common misconception is to assume that differentiation has occurred. This, however, may or may not be the case. While an increase in species richness does indicate an increase in Œ± diversity, homogenization and differentiation specifically address Œ≤ diversity.  Positive relationships with richness  While it may seem counterintuitive, there are times when increased species richness (Œ± diversity) also leads to increased homogenization. If we imagine an example of two communities: community one contains four species (A, B, C, and D). Community two contains three species (C, D, and E). While there is overlap between these two communities, they are certainly different. However, if community two undergoes drastic change where E becomes extinct while A and B are simultaneously introduced, it now demonstrates higher species richness (greater Œ± diversity), because there are now four species present instead of three. Yet, at the same time, communities one and two have become identical, removing any Œ≤ diversity: they have homogenized. This particular trend is frequently observed in studies of biotic homogenization. Sometimes decreased species richness can lead to greater Œ≤ diversity and differentiation. If, in the example above, community one had lost species D and community two had lost species C, both communities would have lower Œ± diversity because each would have one less species. However, the two communities would have no species in common, which would dramatically increase the Œ≤ diversity, leading to differentiation.  Negative relationships with richness  In some cases, increased Œ± diversity could theoretically lead to increased Œ≤ diversity and differentiation. When we return to the previous example, community one still contains four species (A, B, C, and D) and community two contains three (C, D, and E). This time, C goes extinct in community two, but F and G are introduced at the same time. Community two now has greater richness and therefore greater Œ± diversity. It also only now has one species in common with community one instead of two species. The two communities are now more different from each other than they were initially, indicating greater Œ≤ diversity and therefore biotic differentiation. Decreased richness could also lead to homogenization. If A were to go extinct in community one and E were to go extinct in community two, then both communities would have lower richness, since they both would be out one species. There would also be greater overlap in species composition between the two communities, indicating lost Œ≤ diversity and increased homogenization. = Pressures leading to homogenization = Urbanization changes species conformation in a habitat, and it can be a driving force in homogenization. Homogenization can result from either anthropomorphic or natural pressures. Many cases of species introductions are the result of either unintentional or intentional introduction of species by humans, be it for the pet trade, recreation, or agriculture. Urbanization can also have profound impacts on biota, leading to changes in assemblages. Natural selection and other evolutionary forces that lead to extinction can also potentially lead to homogenization. Sometimes, previously isolated populations can become exposed to each other naturally. Species interactions can also cause local extinctions, be the relationship predatory or pathogenic.  Components  = Genetic = Genetic homogenization refers to the underlying molecular processes involved in biotic homogenization. It typically results from hybridization with non-native species, leading to decreased variation in the gene pool. These hybridization events may be either interspecific or intraspecific. Genetic homogenization can be analyzed in terms of allelic frequencies, which is accomplished through a comparison of how common specific genotypes are. If an allele occurs at a similar frequency between two populations, then there is greater homogenization present. Other evolutionary forces such as founder effects and bottleneck effects can also lead to genetic homogenization. = Taxonomic = Taxonomic homogenization is perhaps the most well-known and broadly studied component of biotic homogenization, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. It is most strictly defined as a loss in Œ≤ diversity, meaning that multiple communities are increasing in taxonomic similarity over time. A common misconception with taxonomic homogenization is that it represents a loss in Œ± diversity, or that it leads to decreased species richness. However, assemblages under taxonomic homogenization may actually display an increase in Œ± diversity, a phenomenon that has been observed in plant, animal, and microbial groups. = Functional = Functional homogenization refers to the increase in similarity of function across a community: that is, similarity in the roles filled by the species. In an ecosystem that has undergone functional homogenization, there are increased species that fill the same functional role or niche, with fewer species occupying unique niches.  Analysis  Measuring biotic homogenization ultimately requires measuring Œ≤ diversity. Taxonomic homogenization is typically studied by comparing two species pools that may be separated spatially, temporally, or both. Researchers can choose to use extant pools only or pools containing both extant species and reconstructed historical species. It is not unusual to compare relationships between Œ± diversity and Œ≤ diversity in a population.  Examples  Most studies of biotic homogenization have typically focused on fishes and vascular plants. More recently, however, homogenization has been demonstrated in other taxonomic groups. = Fossil Record = The fossil record gives multiple prehistoric examples of biotic homogenization. For example, the Panamanian land bridge between North and South America allowed previously isolated assemblages to homogenize. However, prehistoric rates of homogenization were at a far slower rate than they are currently. Additionally, organisms have been able to move far greater distances due to anthropomorphic impacts than they ever have done naturally. = Animals =  Birds  Both taxonomic and functional homogenization have been investigated in birds. Certain island studies have demonstrated that on a small spatial scale, that avian taxonomic homogenization occurs far more rapidly than it does on a larger spatial scale. In France, communities have been recorded as becoming increasingly functionally similar over the course of two decades. Interestingly, in other French studies, it has been noted that there is not a temporal relationship between functional and taxonomic homogenization, a trend that had been observed in freshwater fishes. There have been predictions that avian taxonomic homogenization is occurring on the global scale, which could lead to future mass extinctions of avifauna.  Mammals  The alt= Ungulates were studied at both a global and local scale over a span of forty years, ending in 2005. On a global scale, it was found that homogenization had increased by 2%, and that introductions contributed more to this change than did extinctions. In a more localized study in South Africa, homogenization increased by 8%. In this example, species richness increased as homogenization increased.  Fishes  Freshwater fishes were among the first taxonomic groups to be used in homogenization studies, and trends have been observed on several continents. Homogenization in freshwater fishes typically stems from stocking of nonnative fishes for recreational purposes. In a more specific example, there was a 2015 study in Chile, where freshwater systems support diverse assemblages of endemic fishes. In a comparison of 201 watersheds that analyzed changes in similarities over 200 years, approximately 65% of comparisons demonstrate that the watersheds are undergoing homogenization.  Insects  alt= While there have been fewer studies of biotic homogenization in insects compared to other taxonomic groups, there is evidence that it exists in multiple taxa. According to a 2015 study that examined bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, the extent to which taxonomic homogenization occurs varies with taxa, country, and spatial scale. In the three European countries that were included in the study, hoverflies had homogenized in all of the countries while bees and butterflies only homogenized in two countries. The scale at which homogenization occurred also varied between taxonomic groups.  Amphibians and reptiles  The chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is parasitic to amphibians, and has led to homogenization of amphibians in Central America. There has been relatively little research on homogenization in the herpetofauna, and according to a 2006 study, introduction of nonnative reptiles has not led to homogenization of reptilian communities in Florida. However, in Central America, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which is pathogenic to amphibians, has led to selective extinction of certain taxa, which in turn has resulted in homogenization of certain amphibian assemblages. In addition to this more natural example of homogenization, there is evidence that there is amphibian homogenization of human-impacted environments around the world. = Plants = Anthropomorphic impacts on plants have been complex, with overall species richness of flora increasing over the course of human history. Additionally, there have been significantly more introductions on the continental scale than there have been extinction of endemics, increasing overall species richness and Œ± diversity. However, Œ≤ diversity has decreased in some circumstances, resulting in homogenization effects. = Microorganisms = alt= Agriculture in the Amazon river basin has been connected to an increase in Œ± diversity but a decrease in Œ≤ diversity of bacteria. This trend is likely due to the loss of endemic species that have limited ranges being replaced by tolerant, generalist species.  Implications  = Ecology and Evolution = Community composition, rather than richness, plays the more crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem. Due to the fact that the study of biotic homogenization is still relatively new, the implications of homogenization on the environment are still not entirely clear and it is possible that its impacts may not be all negative. Further research is required to determine the extent of its impact on the ecosystem. However, as ecosystems become increasingly similar and simplified, there is concern that the resilience of the assemblages against stressful events will be limited. Indeed, the more limited an assemblage becomes on functional, taxonomic, and genetic levels, the more constrained that assemblage is in its ability to evolve. Natural selection acts on diversity between individuals and species, and if that diversity does not exist, communities are severely limited when it comes to future evolutionary paths. = Conservation = Limiting biotic homogenization ultimately relies on limiting its sources: species invasion and extinction. Because these are largely rooted in human activity, if conservation is to be successful, it is necessary to reduce the degree to which people cause invasions and extinctions. Since biotic homogenization is still a relatively new area of study, increased education about both its mechanism and impact could potentially be effective as well. If we are to improve our understanding of the field, it is necessary to increase the scale of our knowledge of its spatial, temporal, geographic, and taxonomic components. There is a disproportionate number of studies in taxonomic homogenization, with relatively few in functional homogenization, which could have greater ecological implications. Increased study into functional homogenization could give insight into conservation needs. These gaps in the literature may, however, soon be filled. The study of homogenization is increasingly gaining attention in ecological circles, with the number of studies quantifying its effects increasing exponentially between the years of 2000 and 2015.

Its exact definition remains elusive due to the vagueness of the terms ‚Äúcondition‚Äù and ‚Äúsignaling‚Äù. It examines which conditions favor the extravagant displays and ornaments, or signals, some organisms poses, despite their lack of evolutionary value in terms of fitness. Condition-dependent signaling can affect individual mating tactics and depend on an individual's size, age, or other physical factors, such as a more fit individual being able to produce a stronger call than its less fit cohort. It can also impact the signaling choices of organisms based on the environment around them, like vocalizations that are more favorable in lower density environments. Background It is energetically expensive to produce a sexual signal. In some organisms the sexual signal may also have costs in terms of predation. For example, the ornate tail of a peacock makes it more difficult to hide and it also impedes flight. There are also different sexual phenotypes which may change the method of attempted copulation. There may be several male reproductive phenotypes within a species and the phenotype that is manifest may be determined by a number of factors. For example, some phenotypes may employ a more aggressive and direct mating tactic while other phenotypes may use less traditional methods, as is the case with bluegill sunfish, where males use a ‚Äúsneaking‚Äù tactic to find mating opportunities. Previous research has shown a great plasticity in sexual signals based on conditional qualities such as food availability, body condition, environmental conditions, population dynamics, and sexual displays. Condition dependent signaling is an important part of sexual selection theory. For example, if an organism under selection where the sexual signals will not be as effective or they are in an environment lacking in energy, they may allocate less energy toward sexual selection. Condition dependent signaling research seeks to understand the true plasticity of sexual traits and determine if they may be more or less favored under different types of environmental stress.  Acoustic Calling  Individual tactics have been difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis, so research continues to examine the conditions and correlate it to changes in the mating tactics. Acoustic calling is a common mating tactic which can be affected by food availability, and female presence. = Food Availability = In one study researchers conducted an experiment to better understand condition dependent signaling of acoustic calling in relation to food availability. They studied crickets in the wild where they supplemented the experimental groups food supply to see if that would allow the males to allocate more energy toward calling. In comparison to the males in the control group, where the food had not been supplemented, the males in the experimental group were able to call more frequently. The food supplementation had an effect on the frequency of calls however the call itself remained consistent between the experimental and control group. This higher frequency of calls was effective in increasing the attraction of female crickets. This study concluded that condition dependent signaling is an imperative part of how females select their male partners in natural conditions. = Weight and female presence = Acoustic calling may be affected by an organism's physical characteristics which can be affected in turn by the environmental condition. In areas of food and water abundance the organisms may be healthier and better able to allocate more resources toward producing the acoustic calls. Another experiment examining vocalization studied tree frogs. The researchers recorded the calls of the male frogs in two different conditions. In one condition females were present and in the other they were absent. Both weight and condition affected the male frog's ability to call. The smaller males and the males that were in the best condition showed higher plasticity.  Effect of phenotype and mating tactics  In many species there are different mating tactics and they are displayed through multiple reproductive behavioral phenotypes and the different phenotypes have different advantages. These phenotypes, which have different sexual signaling tactics, are selected with consideration to the organism's environmental conditions. If a species energetic reserves need to be conserved for a function other than signaling than the energetically low-cost phenotypes may be selected for, while in times of high energy a less energetically conservative tactic may be favored. There may be a dominant mating tactic that is used by the majority of the males. There could also be alternative mating phenotypes that are employed in different conditions that favor an alternative tactic = Satellites = For example, Satellite males are males that will locate themselves near another male making a call and attempt to intercept the mate that the calling male attracts in order to copulate. In a study examining satellite males among green tree frogs the frogs were shown to switch between satellites and caller depending on the conditions around them. In a high call density, more callers would switch to satellite in order to benefit from the calls being produced but if call density decreased satellites would switch to calling. = Sneakers = The bluegill sunfish is a striking example of using an alternative mating tactic in conditions were the smaller males are not favored by the direct method. There is a direct method in this species dependent on typical sexual signaling such as size and coloring and they are referred to as ‚ÄòParentals‚Äô. However, another method used by some less traditionally favorable males of the species is to disguise themselves as the female of the species in order to sneak past the more traditionally competitive males in order to copulate and fertilize the female. They are referred to as Sneakers. This species also has Satellites. Satellites and Sneakers use the alternative method of female mimicry and sneaking to outcompete the Parental competitors who use a courting and guarding tactic.

This family is divided into eight major phylogenetic lineages. The domestic cat is a member of the Felis lineage. A number of investigations have shown that all domestic varieties of cats come from a single species of the Felis lineage, Felis catus. Variations of this lineage are found all over the world and up until recently scientists have had a hard time pinning down exactly which region gave rise to modern domestic cat breeds. Scientists believed that it was not just one incident that led to the domesticated cat but multiple, independent incidents at different places that led to these breeds. More complications arose from the fact that the wildcat population as a whole is very widespread and very similar to one another. These variations of wild cat can and will interbreed freely with one another when in close contact further blurring the lines between taxa. Recent DNA studies, advancement in genetic technologies, and a better understanding of DNA and genetics as a whole has helped make discoveries in the evolutionary history of the domestic cat.  DNA and phylogenetic evidence  :Note: Current taxonomy does not tend to treat F. silvestris, F. lybica F. catus, and F. bieti as the same species. A 2007 study of feline mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites of approximately 1,000 cats from many different regions (including Africa, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the Middle East) showed 5 genetic lineages of the wildcat population. These lineages included: * Felis silvestris silvestris (Europe) * Felis silvestris bieti (China) * Felis silvestris ornata (Central Asia) * Felis silvestris cafra (South Africa) * Felis silvestris lybica (Middle East) This study showed that F.s. lybica included domesticated cats and that wild cats from this group are almost indistinguishable from domesticated cats. Along with DNA analysis, phylogenetic studies were also conducted to narrow down the evolutionary history. Phylogenetic trees were generated based on mitochondrial DNA analysis. In each study Bayesian, Maximum likelihood, and parsimony maximum likelihood trees all produced identical results. They each show that F.s. ornata, F.s. cafra, and F.s. lybica were all very closely related to a common ancestor. It also showed that this group of variations are monophyletic, meaning they share a common ancestor not shared by other groups. The trees also helped show that F.s. lybica gave rise to the domesticated cats of today. F.s. silvestris showed a very early branching away from the other groups, but still shares a very early common ancestor with the rest of the clades. Domesticated cats originated from near-eastern and Egyptian populations of F.s. lybica. The former gathered around human agricultural colonies themselves, while the latter (~1500 BCE) seems mainly attractive in behavioral traits. They started spreading during neolithic times, but did not become widespread in the Old World until classical antiquity. A newer study from 2018 moves the earlier origin to Southwest Asia. = Traits = An 2014 study compares many cat genomes with tiger and dog genomes. Genomic regions under selection in domestic cats include these involved in neuronal processes (fear and reward behavior) and in homologous recombination (increased recombination frequency). In addition, the KIT mutations responsible for the white-spotted phenotype were identified. The blotched tabby cat trait (Aminopeptidase Q mutation) arose in the Middle Ages. Wild-type cats have a mackerel pattern.  Archaeological evidence  Scientists also used archaeological and behavioral studies to help further solidify the discovery that F.s. lybica was the common ancestor to domesticated cats. Fragments of teeth and bone found at burial sites across the globe have all been connected by DNA analysis to F.s. lybica, some dating as far back as 7,000-8,000 years ago. Originally the Egyptian populations were credited to the early domestication of cats approximately 3600 years ago but archaeological evidence also disputed the hypothesis in 2004. Archaeologists working in Cyprus found an older burial ground, approximately 9500 years old, of an adult human with a feline skeleton. Cats are not native to this area which means the tribe must have brought them with them when they established residence on the island. This finding suggest that people from the Middle Eastern region of the Old World began keeping cats many years prior to the Egyptians.  Behavioral evidence  Behavioral analysis of F.s. silvestris, which was thought to also be a common ancestor to domesticated cats, showed that there were significant differences between the two. F.s. silvestris which is the European wildcat, has a tendency to be very timid and aggressive even when they are raised starting as kittens around a human population. This group was also very territorial and showed aggressive behavior within their own species as well. Hybrids between domesticated cats and silvestris showed less aggressive behavior and more docile temperament leading the scientist to believe that the behavioral difference was genetic and most likely due to a difference in species. This evidence suggest F.s. lybica is thought to be the common ancestor of all domesticated cats today.  Domestic cat breed differentiation  Different from many other domesticated animals who were bred for food, hunting, security or many other functional reasons, modern cat breeds originated from breeding for physical characteristics. Most of these breeds arose within the last 150 years, and, unlike other domesticated animals who have different physical traits that help them achieve different tasks, cat breeds have no differentiation in functionality; just aesthetic differences. Also different from domesticated mammals, domesticated cat breeds have very few genetic differences from their wild ancestors. Physical characteristics like hair color and pattern and the few genes that control these traits are what differentiate the wildcat ancestors from modern domesticated cats. Domesticated cat breeds are also unique in the fact that there are only 40‚Äì50 genetically distinct breeds while other domesticated animals can have anywhere from 65 to 100 genetically distinct breeds.  Breeds of today  In 1871 only 5 cat breeds were recognized by an association in London. Today the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) recognizes 41 breeds and The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes 57 breeds. Most of these breeds are defined by phenotypic characteristics, visible characteristics. Most of which are single gene traits found at low to moderate levels in the non pedigree cat. This means that this characteristic is rare and not seen in the common everyday house cat. Unlike most dogs found today who come from a mixture of purebreed lineages, cats started as a mixture of many wildcat variations and have been selectively bred by humans for certain traits which lead to modern breeds. This is the reason for the massive jump in the number of breeds in such a short number of years. This is also the reason why the associations who classify these breeds use the word \\"pedigreed\\" instead of \\"purebred\\" because no cat is actually purebred. DNA studies have been conducted to connect the pedigree lines to their random bred ancestors. These studies were conducted using the same techniques as mentioned above for finding the common ancestor which were the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites. All cat breeds were found to have originated in eight different regions and then selectively bred multiple times throughout history and relocated multiple times leading to the approximately 45 modern breeds. These eight lineages include Europe, Egypt, India, Southeast Asia, Arabian Sea, East Asia and Mediterranean.

Despite the unusual difficulty of access, in 1832 Pictish symbol stones were found on the summit and 21st-century archaeology has discovered evidence of a Pictish hill fort which may have incorporated the stones in its structure. The stones may have been incised in the third or fourth centuries AD but this goes against the general archaeological view that the simplest and earliest (Class I) symbol stones date from the fifth or even seventh century AD. Sea stack Sited between Stonehaven and the similarly situated Dunnottar Castle, the sea stack is in Strathlethan Bay, with Downie Point to the north and just offshore from the cliffs at Bowdun Head to the south. It is cut off from the mainland at high tide and the flat, grassy summit is entirely surrounded by precipitous cliffs some high. The conglomerate rock is lower Old Red Sandstone. At the time of the hill fort the location may have been a promontory and subsequent erosion of the cliffs has turned it into a stack with a summit plateau about , much smaller than it was in Pictish times. Hill fort Aerial photo of fort excavation (north is to the top right) During archaeological investigations on the summit in 1977 and 1982 nothing of significance was found. In 2015 new excavations by an Aberdeen University team started to reveal the presence of a hill fort and excavations were continued in the following years. There had been a stone rampart framed with timbers leading southwest to the mainland. From radiocarbon dating of the timber the fort has been dated to being used between the second and fourth centuries AD making it the earliest known Pictish fort in Scotland. A hearth and the footings of internal rooms have been found. Glass, samian ware and black-burnished ware pottery and a lead weight have been excavated: all unusual for so far north of the frontier of the Roman empire. Over the centuries some parts of the fort have collapsed away with the erosion of the surrounding cliffs, particularly to the east. The discoveries suggest that the fort was a substantial, high-status building, with stone and oak timbers brought in from a distance. It was later abandoned, possibly when the inhabitants moved to Dunnottar, and possibly because of problems with the erosion of the stack. Symbol stones As early as 1819 a symbol stone had been prised from the stack to be used as a hearthstone but the inscriptions had excited little interest. In 1832 some youths had climbed up and found a wall on the summit plateau of the stack. They threw some of the stones down into the sea and when they were later recovered some of them proved to be Pictish symbol stones. In 1857 these symbol stones were documented by Alexander Thomson. They were illustrated in John Stuart's 1856 and 1867 volumes of The Sculptured Stones of Scotland published by the Spalding Club. A thorough description of the symbols was published in 1992. One stone is now in the Marischal Museum and the others are at Banchory House. The design and relatively small size of the stones is unusual and it shows them to be of an early date ‚Äì they were probably set into the wall of the rampart that has been dated as third to fourth century AD. ‚Äì this is a much earlier date than the conventional view that the simplest and earliest (Class I) stones are from the fifth or even seventh century AD.

Organisms exhibiting a plastic response are capable of allowing their body size to fluctuate with environmental temperature. First coined by David Atkinson in 1996, it is considered to be a unique case of Bergmann's rule that has been observed in plants, animals, birds, and a wide variety of ectotherms. Although exceptions to the temperature-size rule exist, recognition of this widespread \\"rule\\" has amassed efforts to understand the physiological mechanisms (via possible tradeoffs) underlying growth and body size variation in differing environmental temperatures.  History  Comparative photo of a northern red fox and southern desert red fox depicting size differences with increasing latitudes (i.e. Bergmann's rule). = Relation to Bergmann's rule = In 1847, Carl Bergmann published his observations that endothermic body size (i.e. mammals) increased with increasing latitude, commonly known as Bergmann's rule. His rule postulated that selection favored within species individuals with larger body sizes in cooler temperatures because the total heat loss would be diminished through lower surface area to volume ratios. However, ectothermic individuals thermoregulate and allow their internal body temperature to fluctuate with environmental temperature whereas endotherms maintain a constant internal body temperature. This creates an inaccurate description of observed body size variation in ectotherms since they routinely allow evaporative heat loss and do not maintain constant internal temperatures. Despite this, ectotherms have largely been observed to still exhibit larger body sizes in colder environments. = Formulation of the rule = Ray (1960) originally examined body sizes in several species of ectotherms and discovered that around 80% of them exhibited larger body sizes in lower temperatures. A few decades later, Atkinson (1994) performed a similar review of temperature effects on body size in ectotherms. His study, which included 92 species of ectotherms ranging from animals and plants to protists and bacteria, concluded that a reduction in temperature resulted in an increase in organism size in 83.5% of cases. Atkinson's findings provided support for Ray's published works that ectotherms have an observable trend in body size when temperature is the primary environmental variable. The results of his study prompted him to name the increase in ectothermic body size in colder environments as the temperature-size rule.  Tradeoffs as possible underlying mechanisms  = Life history model = Life history models highlighting optimal growth patterns suggest that individuals assess the environment for potential resources and other proximate factors and mature at a body size that yields the greatest reproductive success, or highest percentage of offspring surviving to reach reproductive maturity. = Size at maturity = Environmental temperature is one of the most important proximate factors affecting ectotherm body size because of their need to thermoregulate. Individuals that have been observed to follow the temperature-size rule have slower growth rates in colder environments, yet they enter a period of prolonged growth that yields larger adult body sizes. One proposed explanation for this involves a trade-off in life history traits. Ectotherms experience longer daily and seasonal activity times in warmer climates versus cooler climates, however, the increase in daily activity time is accompanied by higher infant and adult mortality rates due to predation. Under these environmental conditions, some individuals occupying these warmer climate environments will mature at smaller body sizes and undergo a shift in energy allocation of all acquired energy resources to reproduction. In doing so, these individuals sacrifice growth to larger adult body sizes to ensure reproductive success, even if the trade-off results in smaller offspring that have increased mortality rates. = Reproduction = Ectotherms occupying colder environments, such as mountain ranges or other areas of higher elevation, have been observed to invest in reproduction at larger adult body sizes due to a prolonged growth period. These populations of ectotherms are characterized as having smaller clutches of larger eggs, favoring a greater reproductive investment per egg and enhances offspring survival rates. Individuals occupying warmer environments experience a trade-off between body size and overall reproductive success that many individuals occupying colder environments do not, hence, prolonging growth to yield greater reproductive success in colder environments could potentially be an underlying mechanism for why a large percentage of ectotherms exhibit greater body sizes in colder environments. However, a sufficient explanation for this observable pattern has yet to be produced.  Investigation  Common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). = Supporting evidence = * In the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, adult body size reared at 10¬∞C was approximately 33% greater than individuals grown at 25¬∞C. * Ashton & Feldman's (2003) study concluded that chelonians (turtles) follow the temperature-size rule with 14 of 15 sp. decreasing in size with increasing temperature. * Body size in the larval ant lion, Myrmeleon immaculatus, has been observed to follow Bergmann's size clines in response to latitudinal changes. However, when reared in high and low temperatures, body size was not affected. Food availability was the driving mechanism behind recorded body size variation. * Hatchlings of Lacerta vivipara, now known as Zootoca vivipara, from high elevation populations were raised in outdoor enclosures at high and low altitudes. They were observed to have faster growth rates and higher mortality rates in the low altitude enclosures. Although there was no mention of exhibiting body size patterns in accordance with the temperature-size rule, the faster growth rates and higher mortality imply that lizards in the high altitude enclosures had slower growth rates and lower hatching mortality, a routine pattern indicative of species that conform to the possible temperature-size rule tradeoff. * Eastern fence lizards, Sceloporus undulatus, exhibit delayed maturation at larger body sizes, a trend consistent with the temperature-size rule. Eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). = Exceptions = * The grasshopper, Chorthippus brunneus, is a high temperature specialist (or stenotherm) that matures to larger body sizes at high temperatures, making it an exception to the temperature-size rule. * Juvenile survivorship in Sceloporus graciosus is not found to be higher in cooler environments, leading the species to exhibit body size clines inconsistent with the temperature size rule. * In the same study that Ashton & Feldman provided evidence that chelonians exhibit body size clines consistent with the temperature-size rule, they also provided evidence that squamates (lizards and snakes) trend towards larger body sizes in warmer environments (40 out of 56 species increased in size with temperature). This was the first study to show a major group of ectotherms that show the converse to the temperature-size rule. = Notes = The supporting evidence and the exceptions to the temperature-size rule listed above are only a few of the potential supporting/opposing evidence available for the temperature-size rule. Each was provided to support the claim that patterns of body size observed in variable environments are not 100% predictable and more research is required to identify and understand all of the mechanisms responsible.

Sexual selection is a common concept in animal evolution but with plants, it is oftentimes overlooked because many plants are hermaphrodites. Flowering plants show many characteristics that are often sexually selected for. For example, flower symmetry, nectar production, floral structure, and inflorescences are just a few of the many secondary sex characteristics acted upon by sexual selection. Sexual dimorphisms and reproductive organs can also be affected by sexual selection in flowering plants . Therefore, sexual selection is a major driving characteristic of floral evolution.  Mechanisms of sexual selection  There are two main mechanisms of sexual selection in flowering plants, one being intra-sexual competition and the other being female mate choice. Intra- sexual selection is responsible for much of floral evolution and diversification. Intrasexual selection, with the help of pollinators, has also led to some of the most remarkable examples of exaggerated traits of among hermaphroditic plants. Similarly, sexual dimorphism has probably been involved in the evolution of sexual dimorphism in floral traits of dioecious plants, and likely also in the evolution of secondary sexual dimorphism through genetic correlations with floral traits. Sexual selection through female choice is perhaps a more difficult concept to apply to plants. There is evidence that females (or the female function of hermaphrodites) exercise choice, especially during fertilization . These two mechanisms are the main driving forces of sexual selection in flowering plants.  Symmetry and structure  Floral Structure of Citronella Flower Floral symmetry is often acted on by sexual selection. Floral characters are often subject to strong directional selection from pollinators, and this may disrupt developmental homeostasis in flowers that can develop into large degrees of fluctuating asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry in floral traits may lead to sexual selection in plants if pollinators visit symmetrical flowers in an assortative manner. Numerous studies have shown that pollinators preferentially visited more symmetrical floral patterns in flowers, and there are several believed reasons why this pollinator preference exists. First, the preference may be present due to positive reinforcement. From experience, pollinators may learn that asymmetrical flowers provide a lesser award than symmetrical ones. Second, sensory biases predisposed to pollinators could cause them to select symmetrical flowers. This pollinator preference can lead to symmetrical flowers that are fertilized more often. This increase in fertilization frequency increases the amount of seeds produced, and results in an increased production of offspring with symmetrical, attractive flowers .  Sexual dimorphisms  There are numerous examples of sexual dimorphisms in flowering plants. Sexual dimorphic differences include bud abortion, flower size, flower number per plant, floral longevity, nutrient content of flowers, nectar production, flowering phenology and periodicity, floral fragrances, floral defense against herbivory, and various inflorescence characteristics including total flower number, daily display size, and inflorescence architecture. In animal-pollinated species, these differences affect pollinator visitation, competition for mates, and the evolution of sexual dimorphisms . However, there are constraints placed on animal-pollinated species, because too much divergence could interfere with mating success if pollinators are more attracted to one sex than the other, or if the sexes attract different pollinators. Such constraints are absent from wind-pollinated plants, and the contrasting biophysical requirements for pollen dispersal and pollen capture have led to striking cases of sexual dimorphism in plant architecture and flower production in some species . Below are some specific examples of sexual dimorphisms in flowering plants. = Inflorescences = Inflorescence and Corolla Differences Inflorescences can be acted on by sexual selection in many ways, and commonly include arrangement, number, and size. For example, male inflorescence in plants often produce more flowers than females . Furthermore, pollen export and ultimately paternity, often increases with flower number, even for plants with hermaphroditic flowers. Retention of older flowers with no pollinator rewards can lead to increased pollinator visitation rate and increased pollen removal. Studies suggest that there has been selection for increased pollen delivery, achieved through greater inflorescence size, and it seems probable that male-male competition is commonly part of that selection pressure. = Corolla = Corollas are the petals of flowers, and also face sexual selection. Traits such as color, shape, size, and symmetry are often faced by sexually selected pressure. One example is that male flowers are often larger than female flowers, at least in some species. Although this is presumably achieved through resource allocation mechanisms, it is unlikely that resource allocation from lower cost of androecium than gynoecium leading to higher expenditure on corolla in males, is a general and complete explanation of the size differences. Some corolla enlargement may arise by means of selection on correlated characters such as pollen production. However, it is likely that male competition often contributes directly to the evolution of large male corollas, especially where pollen availability is not limiting . = Nectar production = European Honey Bee extracting nectar. Female and Male Reproductive System Nectar production is different for every flowering plant, and has many different selective forces acting upon it. There is no specific evolutionary force that drives nectar production, but it is believed that sexual selection plays a major role. Studies have supported the idea that sexual selection is a probable explanation for at least some species with gender-biased nectar production. For example, gender-biased expression of nectar is often accompanied by a similarly biased expression of other floral characteristics. A specific example comes from the flowers of Impatiens capensis, and how they show increased longevity of the more-rewarding male phase . In other species , petals can be seen to wilt notably during the less- rewarding female phase or they change color as they pass into the less- rewarding female phase. More evidence for sexually selected nectar production relies on specific behaviors of the pollinators. If sexual selection is currently maintaining gender-biased nectar production, pollinators must be able to distinguish between male and female phase flowers. They also must visit preferentially flowers of the more-rewarding phase. For species that have discriminating pollinators, increased rewards can result in increased mating success, which would allow nectar to be a sexually selected trait.  Reproductive organs  Androecium are often faced by the pressures of sexual selection. This is particularly evident when pollen is produced; there may be several sources of sexual selection on the ways that pollen is presented to pollen vectors. Because pollen is packaged in units that ensure that several to many pollen grains travel together as in pollinia, polyads, viscin threads, etc., pollen donors may be able to monopolize stigmas and the associated ovules by blocking access by other males, unless selection also favors compensating stigma enlargement. Furthermore, when pollen germination depends on some minimum number of pollen grains to overcome stigmatic inhibition ,which is a mechanism that heightens male competition, there may be selection for large pollen dispersal units or certain other pollen-dispensing mechanisms. If pollinator visits are few, then there is selection to package pollen in a way that all of it can be removed by one visit . When repeated pollinator visits are typical, there may be selection for various temporal patterns of pollen presentation and various methods of pollen dispensing. Variation in stamen length, both within and among flowers influences pollen dispersal and potential male reproductive success. Increasing the opportunity for paternity by distributing pollen among pollinators may take different routes in different systems, and any of these possibilities can be viewed in a sexual selection context . The gynoecium is also affected by sexual selection. Every part from the ovaries, styles, stigma, and carpels can be faced with the pressures of sexual selection. In ovule packaging, the intensity of pollen competition depends in part on the number of pollen grains relative to the number of ovules. Although many factors may contribute to determining ovule number, one way for females to increase the level of pollen competition is to decrease ovule number while maintaining stigma size. The evolution of functional syncarpy (assuming no other attendant changes) presumably is a simultaneous increase in the number of ovules accessible from one stigma, which tended to decrease the intensity of pollen competition, and a concentration of pollen deposition on a single stigma, which tends to increase pollen competition. Further increases in pollen competition could be brought about by an increase in pollen delivery (through change of pollinator, increased attractiveness of floral display, or rewards), a decrease in ovule number or stigma size, changes in temporal patterns of stigma receptivity, or changes in the competitive environment of the carpel .

Based on that work, in 2002 she co- edited with Giuseppe Bonazzi and a special issue on ‚ÄúSociology of Work and Organizational Studies: the State of the Debate in Italy and Great Britain‚Äù.  Career  Valeria Pulignano is a scholar of employment relations and labour markets, their changing nature and implications for voice at work and labour market inequality in terms of differences in wages, working conditions, job quality and wellbeing. She focuses on European and national (macro) policy processes as well as (micro) power dynamics, that accompanied the changes within the production organization of large corporations; and their effects on wages working conditions and job quality. This has led to two major contributions: The first is the profound theoretical approach of ‚Äòsociological institutionalism‚Äô, where social actors (both capital and labour) ‚Äì and their power resources ‚Äì are the central agents of changes within capitalist societies. In her comparative work on employment where she uses a more ‚Äòdynamic‚Äô and less ‚Äòfunctionalist‚Äô analytical perspective, she has empirically and theoretically contributed to strengthening the sociological political economy (‚Äòpower‚Äô as socio-political) dimension within the study of industrial and employment relations and labour markets, and their transformations, which she has approached from a European comparative perspective. The second major contribution is a more complex and novel interpretation which considers capital and labour as social forces (‚Äòagents‚Äô) of change whose respective nature has undergone continuous fundamental change. By studying the different forces, actors, and processes that concurrently shape the transformations at work, her research in the last ten years has helped to shed light on the importance of using a macro-micro and micro-macro approach empirically and analytically as a way of linking different levels of analysis through the use of a combination of qualitative and quantitative (mixed) methods.

The animal host's body is the environment which applies the selective pressures upon cancer cells. The most fit cancer cells will have traits that will allow them to out compete other cancer cells which they are related to, but are genetically different from. This genetic diversity of cells within a tumor gives cancer an evolutionary advantage over the host's ability to inhibit and destroy tumors. Therefore, other selective pressures such as clinical treatments and pharmaceutical treatments are needed to help destroy the large amount of genetically diverse cancerous cells within a tumor. It is because of the high genetic diversity between cancer cells within a tumor that makes cancer a formidable foe for the survival of animal hosts. It has also been proposed that cancer selection is a selective force that has driven the evolution of animals. Therefore, cancer and animals have been paired as competitors in co-evolution throughout time. Natural selection  Evolution, which is driven by natural selection, is the cornerstone for nearly all branches of biology including cancer biology. In 1859, Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was published, in which Darwin proposed his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Natural selection is the force that drives changes in the phenotypes observed in populations over time, and is therefore responsible for the diversity amongst all living things. It is through the pressures applied by natural selection upon individuals that leads to evolutionary change over time. Natural selection is simply the selective pressures acting upon individuals within a population due to changes in their environment which picks the traits that are best fit for the selective change.  Selection and cancer  These same observations that Darwin proposed for the diversity in phenotypes amongst all living things can also be applied to cancer biology to explain how selection drives change in the population of cells within a tumor over time. Therefore for the purpose of cancer evolution the body of the organism is the environment, and changes in the environment, whether via natural processes or clinical therapies, apply the selective pressures upon cancer that can drive a selective adaptation in cancerous tumor cells.  Diversity is a selective advantage  Cancer is a disease which is highly diverse not only its pathology, but in the initiation and progression from non-cancerous tissue to malignant tumor tissue . Cancer is considered to be stochastic in nature, in that there are many variables and probabilities that contribute to how a cell or tissue progresses from a state of non- cancerous, to cancerous, and eventually to metastasis. Cancer differs from many other diseases due to the uniquely long lifespan of the disease which contributes to the diversity of cancer cells both within a tumor and between related tumors in a host.  Tumor heterogeneity  As time passes cancerous tumors can progress in genetic diversity amongst clonal cells due to the ability to accumulate changes over time, until the tumor reaches homeostasis thus allowing for the spread of the disease throughout the body of a host. Overlap this pathway with all of the other developmental pathways and possible events that can lead to the same outcome of metastasis, and it becomes apparent that cancer has a unique ability to find a way to progress into its cancerous phenotype. Therefore, from the moment of initiation putting cells or tissues down a pathway towards metastasis the majority of tumor cells will accumulate mutations that increases genetic diversity within the tumor (intra- tumor genetic heterogeneity). Not only can tumors be composed of genetically diverse cells, it can also lead to inter-tumor heterogeneity meaning that related tumors within the same host are genetically different. This tumor heterogeneity gives a selective advantage to the best fit clonal and sub- clonal cells of a tumor. Due to the heterogeneity and the unchecked proliferation of tumor cells, cancer is given a selective advantage not only over non-cancerous cells, but also against selective pressures that choose against it, such as pharmaceutical and clinical therapies, and also the host's immune system.  Resistance  Due to its diverse nature, cancer has been able to evolve very defined and specific mechanisms to resist selective pressures. The goal of selective pressures upon cancer is to rid the disease of its diversity and thus in doing so forcing it back into an initial less harmful, more easily treatable, less diverse, non cancerous neoplastic state in which it is considered not to be lethal. A neoplastic state or neoplasm is simply an abnormal growth of tissue which can range from a harmless non- cancerous mole to a cancerous tumor. Cancer can circumvent negative selective pressures due to its ability to accumulate mutations that cause genetic diversity in tumor cells as the cells proliferate. Cancer seems to have evolved a propensity for, or at the very least, a selection for fitness. This is demonstrated in the ability for tumors which are undergoing large amounts of mutations to find a way for the cells composing the tumor to survive and to produce cellular offspring which are better fit for survival. Therefore, cancer initiation and progression have to be highly conserved evolutionarily or a tumor would dissociate merely due to inordinate volume of mutations that occur within it.  Evolution in animals driven by cancer  Another interesting way to look at cancer evolution is not through the lens of how selective pressures shape the disease throughout its time spent within an organism, but rather to think of cancer as a selective force itself shaping the evolution of the populations of animal hosts. By taking this approach cancer selection would be defined in the same terms that natural selection and artificial selection are defined. This means that like natural and artificial selection, cancer selection would be defined as a selective force that is capable of driving population diversity and over time lead to evolution. = Cancer is selfish = Cancer is often defined as being selfish, in that it is composed of selfish cell lines which produce progeny that have higher fitness and reproductive success than parental cells which allow them to out compete other clonal cells. This increase in fitness (cancer progression) is of course detrimental to the host within which cancer resides. Therefore, one could possibly look at cancer and animal hosts to be intertwined in the complicated dance known to biologists as co-evolution. This theory would propose that as animals evolve new morphological traits and life-history behaviors they become more susceptible to developing cancer. Therefore, cancer gains the evolutionary advantage over animals because of newly evolved animal traits that it can select against or for its own survival. This then places the selective pressure back upon animal species to evolve or forever succumb to cancer selective pressures. Most recently it has been theorized that all of the morphological and life history diversity seen today in animals, is the result of the uncountable deaths caused by cancer in ancestral animal lineages. = Examples = Cancer is a disease with a long lifespan. Therefore, as animals evolved into bigger and more complex organisms with longer lifespans themselves their morphologies were highly restricted by the need to adapt a resistance to the negative selective pressures that cancer placed upon them. For cancer cells to thrive they must be able to proliferate unchecked and uncontrolled within the tissues of their animal hosts. Therefore, animals have adapted to cancer selection by evolving tumor suppressing genes. These genes help inhibit the initiation and progression of cancerous cells.

Hollowell in 1893. Completed in 1894, the hospital was part of a small group of buildings constructed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise that included St. Teresa's Academy (demolished). Located at Fifth Street between State and Washington streets, the hospital building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, soon after it became slated for demolition in 1976. With History A hospital had been discussed in Boise City earlier than the 1890s, and Bishop Glorieux of the Catholic Diocese had indicated as early as 1891 that a hospital would be constructed under his supervision. St. Alphonsus Hospital opened in December 1894, under direction of five nurses of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, and it became the seventh hospital controlled by the order. The building's first floor was complete, but the second floor was only partially complete, and the third floor remained unimproved. The first floor contained a six-bed ward room, an operating room illuminated by sunlight, a smoking room, a drug room, and a dining room with kitchen. The Idaho Statesman said of the ward room, \\"so neat and cozy, one would almost wish to be ill in order to have the privilege of using it.\\" During 1895, the hospital received 107 patients, and of the total, 78 were cured, 11 improved, and 14 died. Local doctors had treated patients at the building, but in 1896 the hospital acquired a staff of physicians and surgeons. The staff included Major M.W. Wood, Dr. R.M. Fairchild, Dr. C.L. Sweet, Dr. W.D. Springer, Dr. George Collister, Dr. D.W. Figgins, Dr. L.C. Bowers, Dr. H. Ziph, and anaesthetist Dr. W.H. Schuyler. Two blocks east of the state capitol building, the hospital was purchased by the State of Idaho in 1971 to be converted to office space, but after several arson fires during renovation in 1976, it became unsafe and was razed to provide space for a new state office building. Completed in the late 1970s, the replacement ten-story building was named for longtime Secretary of State Pete Cenarrusa in 1998; its address is 450 West State Street, facing the Idaho Supreme Court. The hospital moved about west in 1972 to its present site on Curtis Road, just south of I-184. Boise's other hospital, St. Luke's, was founded by the Episcopal Diocese of Idaho in 1902, and is located several blocks southeast of the Cenarrusa building.

Though the posts on the page cover a large range of topics, they mainly focus on Asian culture as experienced by the children of immigrants. The group has over 1.8 million members and has been featured in a variety of mainstream news sources for its insights into the Asian diaspora.  History  The Facebook group was created by 9 high-school Chinese- Australian seniors from Melbourne. The high-school seniors thought it would be fun to create a Facebook group to share jokes and experiences of being first- generation Asian-Australians. They named the page \\"Subtle Asian Traits\\", inspired by a then-popular Facebook page called \\"Subtle Private School Traits\\", which was also started by Australian teenagers. Though the page was intended to be a small community, within three months, Subtle Asian Traits was among the most popular groups on Facebook with more than a million members from around the world.  Group features  Subtle Asian Traits is a closed group on Facebook, which means its members are visible to the public but their comments are not visible until the user has joined the group. A Facebook member must request to join a closed group or be added by an existing member or admin. All members of the group may post and comment in the group, however, all posts must be approved by group moderators before it appears on the page. Subtle Asian Traits currently receives over 500 new posts a day. The group mainly consists of jokes and concepts or catchphrases intended for humorous purposes, also known as Internet memes. An example of a popular Internet meme on the page was a picture of an Asian household with many slippers because slippers are a popular feature in many Asian households. Subtle Asian Traits has inspired a large number of other Facebook groups, such as Subtle Asian Leftovers, Subtle Asian Travel, Subtle Asian Dating, Subtle Asian Dating: Wholesome, Subtle Asian Mental Health, Subtle Curry Traits, and Subtle Christian Traits. Some members have criticized the under-representation of non‚ÄìEast Asian perspectives in Subtle Asian Traits, especially the perspectives of South Asians; Subtle Curry Traits was created partly in response to the lack of representation for South Asians. Others argue that its memes perpetuate negative stereotypes about Asians, particularly those of tiger parenting and Asians as a model minority. However, it is suggested that the use of stereotypes in Subtle Asian Traits memes helps to provide a sense of commonality and community among Asians.

She is the Navy's first woman fighter pilot. In 2013 she left the Armed Forces and publicly came out as a lesbian in an autobiographical book. Biography Patricia Campos Dom√©nech was born in Onda, Castell√≥n on 12 March 1977. After studying audiovisual communication at the University of Valencia, she took public exams for the Spanish Navy, through which she obtained one of two fighter pilot positions, finishing above about 200 other applicants. In this role she served as a pilot for VIPs, from high ranking military officers to the Spanish royal family. After eight years as an aviator in the Spanish Armed Forces, she left them in May 2013, after deciding that she did not want to continue hiding that she was a lesbian, and considering that her military life was not compatible with her sexual orientation. She chose to dedicate herself to her other interest, football. She had played this in her university days, and was captain of the women's team at Naval Station Rota, where she was assigned. Consequently, she decided to work as a professional football coach, becoming one of the first women to coach a team at a professional level: Carlsbad United F.C. in the United States. She periodically travels to Uganda, where she participates in several projects for the empowerment of children and women, coaching various amateur teams. As of 2017, she resides in Hawaii. There she serves as coach of the Honolulu Bulls Soccer Club women's team, and also works mornings in the finance department of the University of Hawaii. She posted weekly entries about her personal experiences in the blog F√∫tbol sin Fronteras (Football Without Borders). Activism for LGBT rights While in the Navy she did not reveal that she was a lesbian until she \\"freed herself\\", as she explains in her book Tierra, mar y aire, in which she demands rights for women and the LGBT community. When her sexuality became publicly known, she affirms that despite not being in the military, she had to endure comments from her colleagues, their attitudes and criticisms, and that she was watched much more closely than they were, just for being a woman. It was a \\"very personal and very thought out\\" decision that she made, she adds, because she believed that it was a way to help other girls in her situation. Awards In 2016, Campos Dom√©nech won the Miki Roqu√© Award for Peace in Sport for her work in Uganda, where she was a coach of children's teams of the association Soccer Without Borders.

James came to greater public awareness with her 2014 play Cuttin' It. The play focuses on two teenage girls, both Somalis living in England, who have different perspectives on the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). James was inspired to write the play after watching the documentary The Cruel Cut by filmmaker Leyla Hussein, and after learning that FGM is practiced in Britain. Cuttin' It earned James the George Devine Award, the Alfred Fagon Award, the Critics' Circle Theatre Award, the UK Theatre Award for Best New Play, and the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Most Promising Playwright . She was a finalist for the 2016-17 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, also honoring Cuttin' It. James' play Bricks and Pieces was commissioned and performed in 2016 by Tiata Fahodzi in collaboration with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. The play examines themes of family, loss, masculinity, as well as communication and its lack, and addresses the challenges of being a gay man from an African family in Britain.

Heywood is a British mechanical engineer known for his work on automotive engine research, for authoring a number of field-defining textbooks on the internal combustion engine, and as the director of the Sloan Automotive Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Early life and education  Heywood grew up in the United Kingdom in an academic family, the child of a mechanical engineer father and a metallurgist mother. After graduating from Cambridge University with a BA, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1960 to study at MIT for a master's degree in 1962, and completed a PhD in mechanical engineering in 1965.  Career  Heywood's early work at MIT focused on chemical processes in car engines of molecules like oxides of nitrogen that lead to hydrocarbon emissions, at a time when it was unclear how and to what extent these contributed to atmospheric pollution. In 1972, he became director of the MIT Sloan Automotive Lab, where he worked with James C. Keck and James Fay on internal combustion engines, fuel, automotive pollutants, and policy around the future of transportation. He became a full professor at MIT in 1976. In 1988, he published a textbook, \\"Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals\\", which served as a key text for mechanical engineering courses around the world and as an essential text for professional engineers in the field. The book sold over 130,000 copies, with a second edition published in 2018. In later stages of his career, Heywood worked on a number of forward-looking reports exploring the future of automotive transportation including \\"On the Road in 2020\\", published in 2000 and cited over 400 times, \\"On the Road To 2035\\" in 2008, and \\"On the Road Toward 2050\\" in 2015. His comprehensive work across all parts of automotive engineering earned him the sobriquet \\"the Yoda of cars\\".  Personal life  While at MIT around 1960, he met his wife Peggy who was studying history at Radcliffe College. The two temporarily moved back to England for John to work on plasma dynamics for the Central Electricity Generating Board, before returning to Cambridge in 1968. John and Peggy had three sons; engineer Jamie, craftsman builder Stephen, and entrepreneur Benjamin. In 1999, Stephen was diagnosed with the terminal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the age of just 29. Together the family, led by Jamie, founded the ALS Therapy Development Institute to try and find a cure for Stephen, documented in the documentary film, So Much So Fast, and the book His Brother's Keeper: A Story from the Edge of Medicine, written by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jonathan Weiner. While Stephen died in 2006 from complications of ALS, Heywood continues to serve on the board of ALS TDI alongside his son, Jamie. Stephen's illness also inspired the online patient network PatientsLikeMe, founded by brothers Benjamin and Jamie with a college friend from MIT, Jeff Cole.

Originally settling in Obock, and finally Djibouti City, in the wake of the British succession of the Gulf of Tadjoura to the French in 1884. The vast majority of the community made aliyah to Israel in 1949.  History  Traditional hair wrap Djibouti 1922. Though situated between the historic homelands of the ancient communities of the Beta Israel and Yemenite Jewery and geographically serving as the main link between Arabia and the Horn of Africa there is no documented major presence of Jews in Djibouti until the 1800s. The history of the settlement of Jews in Djibouti begins primarily with the development of the port city of Djibouti at the end of the nineteenth century by the French, in the territory then called C√¥te Fran√ßaise des Somalis, which Jews would play a key role in helping to build. The first documented Jews to permanently settle in Djibouti came from the Protectorate of Aden, which was a British colony since 1839. They are Yemenite Jews, a region where a large diverse Jewish community existed at the time. It is unknown if the Djiboutian Jews are from the Adeni community or are Baladi from the north having just passed through Aden, as they have minhagim (customs) that reflect both. Their arrival is concomitant with the arrival of a large number of Yemeni Muslims. There were fifty Jewish families in Djibouti in 1901 and 111 in 1921. With a slowing of migration between Yemen and Djibouti in the early 20th century much of the community consisted of native Djiboutians who converted and married into the established families. The French authorities counted eleven Jewish traders in 1902, and indicated that they mainly worked as jewelers and craftsmen. They had several synagogues, including the grand synagogue in the city center on Rue deRome. The Hahamim of Djibouti were sought for their halakhic expertise and skill throughout the region. One of the last Rabbi's of Djibouti, Haham Yoseph Moshe would travel to Jewish communities as far as Addis Ababa and Asmara who sought out his skills as a mohel. The Jews were distinguished from their Muslim neighbours by their wearing of long sidelocks called payot and white fringed garments, similar to that of Yemenite Jews. After Israel's independence in 1948, the state organized in 1949 Operation Magic Carpet which evacuated about 45,000 Yemenite Jews threatened by political unrest from Yemen to Israel. Two hundred Jews from Djibouti were included in the evacuation operation. Moshe Sion, a member of the Djibouti Jewish community recalls ‚Äúa plane came from Aden and we all got on and flew to Israel.‚Äù Prior to moving to Israel, his father had served as a posek, hazzan, mohel and sofer of the Djibouti community. After the mass aliyah of 1949 the community never recovered and all remaining families slowly over the decades either joined the others in Israel or immigrated to Europe, mainly France. After their departure most Jewish properties were settled by the local Issa people. A modest cemetery and the grand synagogue (which was renovated into office spaces in 2012, leaving only the original outside facade) are the only two Jewish structures still standing in the country. Nowadays, the Jews that live in Djibouti are mostly French expatriates with Jewish origins and the native population of ‚Äújust a few isolated, unaffiliated Jews.‚Äù  References  Djibouti Jewish Djibouti Category:Jewish Yemeni history ","title":"History of the Jews in Djibouti"},{"id":"59628004","text":"Pepe Reilly (born August 19, 1971) is an American boxer.

He spent the majority of his playing and coaching careers in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), winning one premiership in the league as a player and four as a coach. He retired from state‚Äêleague coaching at the end of the 2011 season, during which he had coached the South Fremantle Football Club. Playing career Dimmer played as a centre half-back, first playing WAFL reserves‚Äìgrade football in 1972 for Subiaco. After winning a reserves premiership with the team, he began playing senior football the following season. That year, he won the only senior WAFL premiership of his playing career in a 32-point win over West Perth. He continued to play for Subiaco until 1979, when he left to East Perth having scored 24 goals in his 90 Lions games. At his new club, he continued to play regular senior football, making 81 appearances from 1980 to 1983. He captained the team in his final season as they achieved a fifth-place finish. During his WAFL career, he represented Western Australia five times in interstate matches, one of which was a State of Origin game. Coaching career After stints with junior and school teams, he joined Claremont's coaching staff in 1987, remaining there until 1993. During his time there, he coached the reserves team to two premierships. In 1994, he coached the West Coast Amateur Football Club, winning the WAAFL A Grade premiership and receiving the JJ Leonard Medal as a personal achievement. The following year, he was appointed head coach of West Perth, leading them to a WAFL premiership in his first year. He continued coaching the Falcons until the end of the 1999 season, during which he led them to a second Grand Final win, defeating South Fremantle in the third year in which the competition was known as \\"Westar Rules\\". In the 2000 season, Dimmer worked as an assistant coach to Damian Drum at Fremantle in the AFL, before returning to the WAFL as West Perth's director of coaching in 2002 and 2003. In 2004, he began coaching South Fremantle, leading them to a premiership the following year in a convincing Grand Final win over Claremont after finishing second during the home-and-away season. In 2009, he won the fourth and last premiership of his career, ending Subiaco's run of three consecutive flags. In 2011, he retired from coaching to focus on a teaching job at Christ Church Grammar School, also coaching the school's first XVIII football team. Outside of club coaching, he led the WAFL representative side in matches in 1996 and 2010. Legacy Dimmer was awarded an Australian Sports Medal on 24 October 2000 for service to Australian rules football.

NCCLs are common in the dentitions of recent human populations. They may result from several processes including abrasion, acid erosion and abfraction.

Most NCCLs in archaeological examples are attributed to abrasion, with ‚Äòtoothpick grooves‚Äô particularly common. Less commonly acid erosion can cause NCCLs, and is caused by the chemical dissolution of dental tissues by acids of non-bacterial origin, most commonly low pH diets.

The bridge was widened in 1832, which had not been anticipated by the original design. On 2 May 1845 the bridge collapsed under load from a crowd who had gathered to watch a circus stunt on the river. Some 79 people, mainly children, were killed. An investigation found fault with the design and workmanship of the bridge. The site of the disaster is marked by a modern-day memorial.  Bridge  An act of parliament was passed in 1827 for the construction of a bridge over the River Bure at Great Yarmouth. The Cory family paid for the bridge which was to replace a ferry and provide easier access from the town to marshland, the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens and a bowling green owned by the family. The investment would be recouped by a toll on those crossing. The architect for the bridge was Joseph John Scoles of London. He designed a suspension bridge with two towers and a clear span of . The span was later increased on site to and the suspension chains increased in length accordingly but it is not thought that Scoles was consulted on this matter (it would be considered usual to increase the height of the towers to match the lengthened chains). The bridge was supported by a suspension chain at both edges of the deck, each chain being formed from two sets of eyebars which had been made by a local blacksmith. The wide deck, which was slightly arched, carried a central single carriageway of width and two footways each in width. The deck was attached to the suspension chains by vertical iron rods. The towers were constructed on piled foundations on either bank and were apart measured centre to centre. The bridge was constructed by Gidney Goddard and supervised by Mr Green, a local surveyor. The bridge opened for public use on 23 April 1829. Scoles attended the opening, which was the first time he had attended the site. In 1832 the road from Yarmouth to Acle was routed over the bridge. This had not originally been intended and, to provide sufficient width for two carriages to pass each other, the bridge was widened by hanging the footways from the sides of the deck.  Disaster of 2 May 1845  Cooke's Circus poster advertising Nelson's stunt Cooke's Circus was in Great Yarmouth and as part of a promotion it was advertised that a clown, named Arthur Nelson, would sail up the River Bure in a washtub pulled by four geese on 2 May 1845. The trick, first devised by Dicky Usher in 1809, was achieved by having the tub attached to a rowboat by an underwater line. A large crowd assembled in the vicinity from around 5 pm to view the feat which started with the flood tide. Several thousand people viewed the clown from the river banks and at least 300 in a crowd 4‚Äì5 deep on the southern footway of the bridge. At this time one of the eyebars in the southern suspension chain failed; this was witnessed by members of the crowd but no action seems to have been taken to evacuate the bridge as a result. The second eyebar in that portion of the chain took up the full load for around five minutes before it too failed. The south side of the deck fell into the river, though the north end remained suspended by the surviving chain, and the majority of the crowd were tipped into the water. Children, who formed much of the front rank of the crowd, were crushed against the parapet railing by those behind them. One child was saved from being swept away by her mother holding onto her with her teeth. Boats soon arrived on the scene to rescue the victims. The wounded and dead were taken to nearby houses and pubs (including the Norwich Arms, the Admiral Collingwood and the Swan). The Union House hotel supplied blankets for the wounded and Lacons Brewery made quantities of hot water available for hot baths to revive the survivors. Some 75 bodies were recovered on the day of the accident, though some remained trapped in the wreckage of the bridge ‚Äì one man was rescued alive some time later after being freed with the use of a crowbar. In all 79 people were killed in the disaster, of whom 59 were children. Most of the dead were under 13 years of age and the youngest victim was two years old.  Investigation  The coroner's inquest was held the next day in a local church hall. The British government commissioned a report by James Walker, past-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). Walker found that Scoles' original specification correctly called for high quality iron to be used for the eyebars but failed to specify any testing of the product. He found that the failure occurred in a joint within the eyebars ‚Äì each of which had been forged from three separate pieces: two eyes and a bar. The scarf joint between the components had been imperfectly welded with the weld covering only one third of the surface area of the joint. Had the welds been carried out correctly it is likely that the rods would not have failed. Walker also noted that the rod portion of the eyebars was made of better quality iron than the eyes and that the second rod to fail had extended by around an inch under the load imposed. Depiction of the collapse in the Illustrated London News There was further discussion of the report by several leading engineers in the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Walker claimed that the decision taken to widen the bridge was a poor one. Though the additional weight imposed () was small compared to the weight of the original deck () the extra weight, being outside of the original deck area, was carried entirely by one of the chains. It was thought that, had the bridge not been widened, it would have been able to accept the crowd loading. Indeed crowds of 2‚Äì3 times as many people had previously been present on the bridge but the loads had been spread more evenly across the two suspension chains. Leading bridge engineer and future ICE president James Meadows Rendel was of the opinion that such a slender suspension bridge should not have been constructed in a location susceptible to crowd loading. He noted that a similar bridge at Montrose, Angus had collapsed when a crowd formed on it to observe a boat race. Rendel described the Yarmouth bridge as \\"a mere toy\\" and that the design was not well conceived. He was of the opinion that a traditional arch bridge should have been constructed instead or otherwise the deck made rigid by use of a truss. The primary cause of failure was attributed to the welding of the eyebars which was described as defective. Rendel found them to be of such poor quality that they would have failed under any adequate scheme of testing. Regular maintenance inspections of the bridge may have picked up the issue and one ICE member made the recommendation that public bridges be regularly inspected by a competent engineer.  Legacy  Plaque on the Swan The disaster is described as the \\"largest recorded loss of life\\" in Great Yarmouth. It is commemorated by a blue plaque on the former Swan Inn, some north of the site of the bridge. Lanterns were lit at the site in 2013 to mark the 168th anniversary of the disaster. A permanent memorial costing ¬£5,000 was erected near to the site of the bridge on North Quay Road in September 2013. This comprises a high granite block carved to resemble an open book.

Colonel on July 16, 1863 (after being wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg), then to full colonel (commanding Payne's brigade, among other units in the war's final days) on October 21, 1864. His obituary in the Confederate Veteran claimed he was promoted to Brigadier General at war's end. Meanwhile, his wife attempted to run the estate, which was in a contested area, and suffered significant damage during the war. His brother, Daniel H. Morgan, fought with the 6th Sixth Virginia Cavalry until his capture by Union forces and imprisonment at Point Lookout. During the war's final campaign, Morgan had a horse shot out from under him on April 6, 1865 during the Battle of High Bridge.http://www.bedinger.org/colonel-william-a-morgan.html Days later, Morgan and his troops were present at Appomattox Court House but he did not surrender. Morgan laid down his arms in Winchester, Virginia and returned to what was left of his farms in Jefferson County. Resuming farming, Morgan remained active in local civic affairs, becoming the deputy sheriff for Jefferson County in 1872 (when many Confederate officials received pardons), as well as represented the county at the West Virginia Constitutional Convention that year. He would continue as deputy sheriff for 26 years, until his death. He offered space on his property to the Morgans Grove Agricultural Association, which in 1885 held a very successful fair after the Shenandoah Valley Railroad reached Shepherdstown, and built a stop for the event. The fair continued annually, becoming a four day event, and bought land from Morgan's long-time neighbor, former Confederate delegate and Col. Alexander Boteler in June 1889, then grew more and spilled onto Morgan's property.Morgans Grove NRIS p. 16-17 of 43 Death and legacy Morgan died in Shepherdstown, West Virginia on February 14, 1899, and was buried at Elmwood cemetery there.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22761684/jacob-morgan The fairs continued annually for decades, but the Great Depression caused their demise. The fairgrounds themselves were sold to a farmer circa 1941, but the Shepherdstown Mens Club bought 20 acres in 1961 for use as a civic park, which they named after the Morgan family.Morgans Grove NRIS p. 11 of 43, available at http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/jefferson/99000286.pdf It expanded into the Morgan's Grove historic district on the National Register of Historic Places and encompasses several properties.

He worked with various circuses but was associated most with Astley's Circus. Barry was a traditional \\"buffoon\\" whiteface clown whose performances were based on physical humour. In 1844 he featured in a famous stunt whereby he appeared to be towed along the River Thames in a tub pulled by four geese. Barry left Astley's Circus in 1848 after falling-out with another clown, though he later returned, he retired permanently in 1856 after another disagreement. Whilst out of the circus Barry was landlord of the Crown Tavern in Lambeth.  Early life and career  Thomas Barry was born in Ireland in around 1810. He was married to Elizabeth Campbell (died 1873), an actress who performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre and in Marylebone. Barry's son, also called Thomas Barry, was born in Manchester in 1839 ‚Äì he would later also perform as a circus clown. Barry joined Sam Wild's Circus in 1837 and performed in Swansea, Wales with Samwell's Circus and Cornwall's Royal Circus. The townspeople rewarded his performance by commissioning an oil portrait of Barry that was presented to him \\"as a mark of their esteem of his public & private worth\\". From 1843 Barry worked at Astley's Circus as a whiteface circus clown, the start of a long association with that circus that would last until his death. Barry's style of clowning has been described as traditional, playing the buffoon character and relying on physical humour. However, he also performed with horses as an equestrian clown. His most famous sketch was an impression of a parliamentary candidate speaking at a hustings. Barry's whiteface makeup included a small red outline to the mouth, red triangles on his cheeks, black eyebrows and a bald cap. Barry's character was described by an employer as jovial and good-natured. The young W. S. Gilbert was a fan of Barry's as a child and once, starstruck upon recognising him, followed him down a street. In 1844 Barry took part in a stunt where he sailed down the Thames between Vauxhall and Westminster in a tub pulled by four geese. The trick, first devised by Dicky Usher in 1809, was achieved by having the tub pulled by a rowboat attached by an underwater line. The stunt was popular at the time; in 1845 a similar trick performed by another clown, Arthur Nelson, caused the deaths of 79 people when a large crowd caused the collapse of Yarmouth suspension bridge.  Leaving Astley's  Barry reached the height of his fame in 1847 by which point he had become a long-term fixture at Astley's Circus. However, the next year he fell out with W. F. Wallett, a clown at the circus. Wallett was pioneering the more sophisticated Shakespearian clown role in his performances. Barry demanded the right to choose which parts Wallett would be allocated to play in the show but this was denied and he left Astley's Circus. He was replaced as principal clown by Wallett, who described the situation as arising from Barry's jealousy. Leaving the circus behind Barry took on the running of the Crown Tavern in Lambeth, where he was landlord until 1850. In 1849 he found work for a 9-week season at Hengler's Circus in Windsor and by the early 1850s he had returned to Astley's Circus on a wage of ¬£10 per week. He appeared before a court at Lambeth in 1850 charged with assaulting William Henry Harvey, the ballet master at Astley's. In 1853 Barry worked at Madame Macarte's Monster American Circus in Wolverhampton and E. T. Smith's Circus in Drury Lane, London. From 1853‚Äì54 he was with Hernandez and Stone's Circus, though he continued to perform at Astley's Circus throughout this time. Barry left Astley's Circus for the final time in 1856 when he was denied the first choice of parts in the show. He returned to managing the Crown Tavern, where he was landlord until his death. In 1857 he was known to be unwell and William Cooke, the manager of Astley's Circus, hosted a benefit show for Barry, providing free use of a venue. Barry died on 26 March 1857 and is buried in West Norwood Cemetery.

Carolina Mercer Langston (February 22, 1873 ‚Äì June 3, 1938) was an American writer, actress and mother to poet, playwright and social activist Langston Hughes.  Childhood and family background  Carolina (Carrie) Mercer Langston was the daughter of Charles Langston and Mary Leary (one of the first black women to attend Oberlin College). Carrie Langston's father, Charles Howard Langston, was the son of a prosperous Virginia planter and a slave woman of both American Indian and African descent. An ardent abolitionist and follower of John Brown, he also served as associate editor of the Historic Times (a black community newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas), as president of the local Colored Benevolent Society, and as grandmaster of Lawrence's Black Masonic Fraternity. His brother (Carrie Langston's paternal uncle), John Mercer Langston, was a post- emancipation congressman from Virginia who later served as Minister to Haiti and Dean of Howard University's Law School. Mary Leary's first husband, Lewis Sheridan Leary, died in 1859 from injuries incurred aiding John Brown during the Harper's Ferry raid on the federal arsenal. Leary's bloodied bullet- riddled death shroud, sent to Mary Leary as a sign of his death, would become a significant family symbol: grandson Langston Hughes placed it in a New York City Fifth Avenue bank safe deposit box in 1928. Carrie Langston had a foster brother, Desalines (foster son to Charles); a half-sister, Loise (daughter to Mary by Lewis Sheridan Leary); and a brother, Nathaniel Turner Langston (named for the legendary slave revolt leader). Nathaniel Turner Langston was born in 1870 and killed in a flour mill accident at age 27.  Social and political significance  At fifteen, Carrie Mercer Langston was a \\"belle of black society\\" in Lawrence, Kansas. At eighteen, she was publicly reading papers she'd written and recited an original poem before the Inter-State Literary Society. She became central to Lawrence's St. Luke's Progressive Club and was elected 'Critic' by a rival society at the Warren Street Second Baptist Church. In 1892, American Citizen newspaper dubbed Carrie Langston and three others as \\"the most beautiful girls in Kansas.\\" Langston wrote for The Atchison Blade, a family-operated African-American newspaper published out of Atchison, Kansas. In 1892, writing as a young, single, black woman, she refuted what she termed ‚Äúthe male notion‚Äù that females were content with their position in life. Her writing was influenced by her father and his support of the 1867 Kansas suffrage referendum. Her words were aimed at Midwestern black men who maintained strict ideas about women's place in society. She especially encouraged the participation of Black women in politics. She spoke publicly on women in journalism, addressed A.M.E. Church conventions, and served as deputy clerk in a district court office.  Personal life  Carrie Langston's first marriage was to James Hughes, a descendant of two prominent white Kentucky grandfathers and African-descendant grandmothers. Their wedding was an elopement, a civil ceremony on April 30, 1899 in Guthrie, Oklahoma, with neither friends nor family attending. 'Shotgun wedding' rumors spread, though she may have become pregnant within days of their marriage. The couple moved to Joplin, Missouri where James Hughes got a job as a stenographer and Carrie Langston Hughes experienced a miscarriage. From Joplin, the couple moved to Buffalo, New York with plans to move to Cuba. Carrie Langston Hughes learned she was pregnant again; she returned to Joplin. However James Hughes, seeking to escape segregation in the U.S., moved to Mexico where he spent most of the rest of his life becoming fairly prosperous. Carrie gave birth on February 1, 1902 to James Mercer Langston Hughes in Joplin, Missouri. Carrie hoped to reunite with her husband so when Langston was five years old she took him to Mexico to meet his father. While there, Mexico was struck by the historic April 14, 1907 earthquake. That event sent Carrie Langston Hughes with her son swiftly back to the States; young Langston Hughes witnessed prayer and wreckage there from his father's shoulders impacting him for the rest of his life, as evidenced in his later writing. Mother and son returned to Lawrence where she left her son to be cared for by her mother (now about seventy) while she moved to Topeka. Carrie Langston Hughes returned several months later to take her son to Topeka planning to enroll him in the Harrison Street School. Harrison's principal, Eli S. Foster, demanded Langston attend the more-distant colored children's Washington School. Carrie Langston Hughes claimed her young son could not walk that distance daily but she still met resistance; she took her case to the Topeka Board of Education and won. But before the end of the school year, Langston was back with his grandmother in Lawrence. Almost fifty years later, in a federal lawsuit regarding the same school board, a Supreme Court decision would end school segregation in the United States. Carrie Langston Hughes called herself different names throughout her life; these names included Caroline Langston, Carolyn Hughes, Carolyn Hughes Clark sometimes spelled Clarke (referring to her having wed Homer Clark following the divorce from Langston's father), and Carrie Clark or Clarke. She also lived many places with and without her son while he was growing up. As a result, Langston Hughes was raised for the most part by Carrie Langston's mother, Mary Leary, in Lawrence, Kansas with his mother making occasional visits. Carrie Langston's peripatetic life was driven by job searches and boredom. The deaths of her parents (Charles Langston died in 1892; Mary Leary died on April 8, 1915) left her bereft of both the political privileges they had provided and the social consciousness they had instilled in her. Her second husband, Homer Clark, had a son from a previous alliance named Gwyn Shannon Clark (b. September 24, 1913) who accompanied Carrie Langston through most of the rest of her adult life. In March 1933, Carrie Langston's lifelong wish to be an actress of some success was fulfilled: she appeared on Broadway as Sister Susie May Hunt in Hall Johnson's theatrical production, Run, Little Chillun. James Nathaniel Hughes, Langston Hughes's father, died on October 22, 1934 of complications from several strokes; neither Carrie Langston nor Langston Hughes were mentioned in his will. On May 14, 1935, in a letter to Langston Hughes who was living in Mexico, Carrie Langston wrote of \\"a very bad blood tumor\\" on her breast; on June 3, 1938, Carrie Langston died of breast cancer. Carrie Langston counted among her friends Zora Neale Hurston.

In January 2019, the Eleven announced a new stadium plan, with a 20,000 seat stadium being the centerpiece of a $550 million mixed-use development including 600 apartments, more than of retail space, of office space and a 200-room hotel. The stadium would also have the potential to host concerts, women's soccer team, college and high school soccer, football, field hockey, rugby and lacrosse. In February, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill, with a requirement that the Eleven reach an agreement to join Major League Soccer before the stadium could be built. In April the bill passed the house with the MLS requirement removed. The bill would also pass the senate, and was signed by Governor Eric Holcomb in late April.

The campus, built in the 1970s following the Leuven crisis, houses the Faculties of Medicine and Dentistry, Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences and of Public Health, the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, the university's main academic hospital, as well as many other institutions of higher education and a vast sports complex. It is one of the three UCLouvain sites in Brussels, with UCLouvain Bruxelles Saint-Gilles and Saint-Louis University, Brussels. History Following the split of the Catholic University of Louvain into two legally independent entities in 1968, the majority of the French-speaking university was relocated in Louvain-la-Neuve (Walloon Brabant) since 1972. It was however decided to move the medical school to the eastern suburbs of Brussels, including the construction of a new university hospital complex. In 1968, UCLouvain acquired land in the Brussels municipality of Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and set up its medical faculties, which opened in 1974. In the early 1970s, the university also began construction of the new hospital, the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, which were inaugurated in 1976. The Alma metro station on the city's rapid transit network, located in the centre of the campus, was inaugurated in 1986. Initially dedicated to education in medical sciences by the university or partner schools, the campus quickly became a multidisciplinary hub by inviting an increasing number of partner institutions, to become Brussels' second largest student campus, with over 14,000 students.  Description  Place de l'Alma in 1982. Similar to Louvain-la-Neuve, a planned city built in the 1970s, the Woluwe site is built on an urban and neo-pedestrian model. The campus is centered around the Place de l'Alma, the main square built on different levels, whose buildings are now listed as protected monuments. From the very beginning, the Alma square is planned to include the university's administrative services (the \\"Mairie\\"), commercial and leisure facilities, particularly in the vast M√©m√© complex, as well as a metro station, Alma, considered to be a total artwork. The metro station was initially planned under the university hospital. Indeed, a large space in the state of structural work exists under the hospital, hidden from the public. The centre of Louvain-en-Woluwe is the work of the architect Lucien Kroll. His plan was to build a university town in consultation with the students. This is how the Maison M√©dicale (the \\"M√©m√©\\") was built on the Place de l'Alma, a vast multi-functional building with student accommodation on the higher floors. The buildings are designed in an ambivalent way with two opposing \\"wings\\": for example in the M√©m√©, Lucien Kroll envisions on one side, a so-called \\"fascist wing\\", with identical kots (student rooms) down over a long corridor, and on the other hand a wing with modular spaces, many variations in elevation, width and height within each room and sinuous corridors. Shared kots have also been designed, called granges (\\"barns\\"). To the north of Place de l'Alma are the UCLouvain buildings: the hospital at north-west, university spaces to the east. Among the latter, the Auditoires Centraux, the first building of the campus, houses the main teaching locations as well as the Health Sciences Library. Attached to the Central Auditoriums, the Andr√© Simonart auditorium, with 900 seats, Brussels second largest, was inaugurated in 2015. Further east are various academic and scientific buildings, mainly research centres including the de Duve Institute and the Belgian branch of Ludwig Cancer Research, followed by the Mounier Sports Complex. Finally, above the Crainhem metro station, the campus is enclosed by its own fire station, PASI UCLouvain, as well as the power station and central heating system. The eastern part of the campus is made up of a park with a botanical garden of medicinal plants, the Jardin Paul Moens. Since March 2019, the UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe campus has its own local police office, made up of five police officers from the Montgomery police zone. The Jardin des plantes m√©dicinales Paul Moens.

Characterized as a \\"staunch Liberal\\", and influenced by Lydia Becker, Balgarnie began her support of women's suffrage from the age of seventeen. Early years Florence Balgarnie was born in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, England, August 19, 1856. Her parents were Rev. Robert Balgarnie (1826‚Äì1899), a well-known Nonconformist minister of the South Cliff Congregational Church, and his wife, Martha Rooke. The family included two younger sisters, including one named Mary. Career Balgarnie was elected to the Scarborough School Board in 1883. It was here that Balgarnie developed her skills as a speaker. In her native town, she aroused high anticipations for her future career. Since coming to London, in 1884, or 1886, temperance was the subject which interested her the most, and the one on which she spoke with the greatest frequency. It was around 1884 that, with some fear, Balgarnie first began public speaking, but it became a source of pleasure. A great temperance meeting at Derby, England during a General Election, found her addressing several thousand people in the open air. It was to her \\"a crowded hour of glorious life\\"; and it was characteristic of her power of repartee that a dissident in the crowd who set himself to interrupt Balgarnie's speech became converted to her view. By 1889, she was the secretary of the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage, but this position was given up for an even more congenial one, that of organising secretary, under Lady Henry Somerset, of the British Women's Temperance Association. Balgarnie held this appointment till 1895, and thereafter made time for speaking and writing on behalf of temperance and other causes. Balgarnie was the author of A plea for the appointment of police matrons at police stations (1894). In 1902, in Washington, D.C., she represented the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies at the First Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. She was also affiliated with the International Arbitration & Peace Association, the British Anti-lynching League, and the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors, Personal Rights Association, Moral Reform Union, and the Men and Women's Club. She was a co-founder of the executive committee of the People's Suffrage Federation. She died in Florence, Italy, 25 March 1928, and was buried at Cimitero degli Allori, in Florence.

Early life and education  Nobes went to school at Windsor Girls' School and was a county level high jumper as a teenager. She studied biochemistry at the University of London. She completed a PhD at the University of Cambridge, working with Martin Brand. Nobes did brief Post-Docs in Helen Saibil and Aviva Tolkovsky's labs in Oxford before joining Alan Hall's laboratory at the University College London, where she identified the role of the GTPase CDC42 and effectors in forming actin-rich filopodial extensions. She investigated the regulation of actin polymerisation and how cell movement determines polarity and adhesion. She was awarded a Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine Fellowship in 2007, which allowed her to study cell migration in the context of axonal guidance and cancer metastasis.  Research and career  Catherine Nobes Nobes was awarded a Medical Research Council Fellowship at University College London in 2001, where she worked in the Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology (LMCB). Her work was featured in a Wellcome Trust exhibition of art and science, Growth and Form. She joined the University of Bristol as a Reader in 2006, and was promoted to a Professor of Cell Biology in 2012. She delivered her inaugural lecture in 2014, discussing cell migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Since 2014 she has been the head of the School of Biochemistry, the first woman to do so in the School's 50 year history. Her work largely considers the social behaviour of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. She studies how colliding cells that come in to contact with each other stop migrating toward their partner, repolarise and move away from one another - a process known as contact inhibition of locomotion. She has studied how this cell behaviour is regulated by Eph-ephrin signalling. Eph receptors are part of the receptor tyrosine kinases; with two main families - EphA and EphB. Nobes showed that in metastatic prostate cancer cells, EphB receptors are misregulated in ways that might lead to cancer cell invasion / metastasis. She showed that similar activation of Eph signalling may underpin epithelial cell loosening during wound healing. = Academic service = Nobes has served on the grant allocation board of the Royal Society. She was the editor of the British Society for Cell Biology newsletter. In 2018 she joined the Advisory Committee of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine.

The case was brought after the United States moved to seize the wine on the grounds that it had been deliberately mislabeled as sherry to get a tax drawback, and the buyers objected. The original trial was ruled in favor of the United States but was ordered to be retried after errors were discovered concerning jurisdiction. In the subsequent retrial, the Supreme Court ruled against the United States; however, they did grant them a certificate of seizure on probable cause. The defendant in this case was an object rather than a person, making this a jurisdiction in rem case, power over objects, rather than the more familiar in personam case over persons.  Background  The 422 casks of Malaga wine were imported into the United States via New York State as a false entry before being moved to New Orleans. The wine was seized, as it had been mislabeled as sherry and was being used to falsely claim a tax drawback in 1819.. The seizure was challenged by Hazard and Williams, who were to purchase the wines from Charles Hall. The case was first heard as \\"The Sarah\\", named after the ship on which the wine was seized. During the proceedings at the District Court of Louisiana, it was revealed that the wine was seized on land rather than on the sea, so the United States moved for a jury trial. The jury found for the United States, with the judge issuing a sentence of condemnation against the wine. The appellants for the wine appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that there had been irregularities in the proceedings, as it had started as an Admiralty court case but then was treated as an Exchequer court case under the Judiciary Act of 1789 and should not have been a jury trial. The District Attorney argued that there was nothing stopping an Admiralty court from calling for a jury trial, citing the judices selecti of the Roman Empire. In 1823, the Supreme Court found that there were irregularities; when the court found that the wine was seized on land, the judge should have stopped the trial, as he had no jurisdiction. As such, the Supreme Court annulled the seizure order and remitted the case back to the District Court for retrial.  Case  Upon the District Attorney amending the complaint to an Exchequer case, the jury in this case found in favor of the wines. The Attorney-General of the United States appealed the decision to the Supreme Court on the grounds of asking for a Writ of Error in that Hall, the real owner, had not expressed opposition to the seizure. Hazard and Williams argued as the buyers, they had legal title to the wine. Justice Story delivered the verdict. He stated that because Hazard and Williams had proved they had a proprietary interest in the wine, they were legally entitled to challenge the seizure even if they were not the real owners. The court also held that while the mislabeling may have been fraudulent, it did not mean that the transfer of ownership was automatically void unless the claimants stated so. The court found there had been no error and affirmed the jury's decision in favor of the wine; however, it did grant the United States a certificate of probable cause of seizure as the cause for seizure affirmed in the original jury verdict had not been denied. The case was returned to the District Court to either return the wine to the claimants or proceed with the seizure under the certificate. The case is cited as legal precedent for in rem cases where the claimant must put their claims on oath or the other party can insist on dismissal.

It has a rosette of elliptic leaves with 3‚Äì5 veins, and long, hairy stalks, each topped with one floral head consisting of about thirty middle blue ray florets encircling many yellow disc florets. It can be found in the mountains of Lesotho, eastern South Africa and Swaziland.  Description  Felicia rosulata is a perennial, herbaceous plant of up to high. Underneath its leaf rosettes with single-headed upright stems, it has short branched rhizomes, and rarely short runners are present too. Most leaves are in a rosette near the base, alternately arranged on the stem, the lower inverted egg-shaped to elliptic, about long and 2 cm (1 in) wide (rarely 9 √ó 3 cm), entire or with teeth along its margins. The leaves at the base each have three or five conspicuous main veins, and their surface is short and densely hairy. The leaves along the stem above the rosette are much smaller, lance- shaped, the lowest up to long and wide, becoming smaller towards the top. The flower heads sit individually on top of a densely hairy stalk, near to the head also with scattered glandular hairs. The involucre is about across, and consists of three rows of about equally long bracts, without resin ducts, covered with long bristly and slightly glandular hairs, less hairy further inwards. Those in the outer and inner rows are about long and 1 mm (0.04 in) wide, those in the middle long and 2 mm (0.08 in) wide. About thirty female ray florets with a blue strap and a hairy tube. These encircle many bisexual, disc florets with a yellow corolla of long. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a narrowly triangular appendage. Around the base of the corolla are many white, shortly toothed, deciduous pappus bristles. The brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are 3 mm (0.12 in) long and 1 mm (0.6 in) wide, have a light brown marginal ridge, and the more or less smooth surface carries short hairs. Felicia rosulata is a diploid having nine sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=18).  Taxonomy  As far as is known, the species was first collected for science by Ferdinand Krauss on the Tafelberg in Natal in 1839. It was described by Carl Heinrich 'Bipontinus' Schultz, who named it Agathaea natalensis in 1843. In 1865, William Henry Harvey, who was a lumper sunk Agataea in Aster, creating the combination Aster natalensis. In 1897, Rudolf Schlechter reassigned it again, now to Felicia, making the combination Felicia natalensis. However, the combination Felicia natalensis had already been created by Bipontinus, also in 1843, a name that is now synonymous with Felicia erigerioides, an older name created by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1836. Therefore, since Felicia natalensis is not available, Peter Frederick Yeo created the new combination Felicia rosulata in 1970. In his 1973 revision of the genus Felicia, J√ºrke Grau regarded all of these name synonymous.  Distribution  Felicia rosulata can be found in Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa (Eastern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, and Mpumalanga).  Conservation  The continued survival of Felicia rosulata is considered to be of least concern.  Use  Felicia rosulata is used as an ornamental in rock gardens.

Development In 1937, the Imperial Navy of Japan formulated the technical task of the 12-Ci for the construction of a forward three-four-engined flying boat. The maximum flight range was 9250 km with a bombing of 1600 kg. Such a large range of flight was due to the desire of the fleet to cause torpedo- bombing strikes on the ships of the US Navy in Pearl Harbor without intermediate refueling at sea. The development of the aircraft was assigned to the design team of the 1st Fleet Arsenal in Yokosuka , headed by Jun Okamura. The project was carefully classified, no one except the developers knew about it. However, it is known that the H7Y was four-engined, with Junkers Jumo 205C radial engines, which were purchased in Germany. In addition, Japanese designers studied the development of the German aircraft Dornier Do 26.Encyclopedia of Japanese Aircraft 1900-1945, Vol. II Aichi/Kugisho aircraft\\" (Shuppan-Kyodo Publishers, Japan, 1966) The first and only prototype was built in 1939. It was a flying boat with a high-placed wing and four engines. The designers attached great importance to the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft, so the fuselage, wing and engine bonnet had a minimum number of protruding parts. To increase the range, it was necessary to donate a defensive weapon. The H7Y was intended to conduct reconnaissance missions over Hawaii from Micronesia.Robinson, 1979. Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aviation, Volume 20. New York, Marshall Cavendish. In the course of flight tests, the H7Y, which was as light as possible, showed unsatisfactory results. The fuselage was not tight enough. During the take-off, the wings were too dangerous to fluctuate. Due to the lack of engine power, taking off from the water was difficult. Attempts by the designers to reinforce the structure of the glider led to an increase in mass, which made it impossible to reach the Hawaiian Islands without refueling. And with refueling in the sea from submarines strike at Pearl Harbor could design a flying boat Kawanishi H8K , which could carry a significant bombing and was well protected. Thus, in 1940, the Yokosuka H7Y program was cancelled.http://www.daveswarbirds.com/Nippon/aircraft/Tillie.htm Although the Yokosuka H7Y project was extremely secretive, TAI gave it the codename name \\"Tillie\\".

History La Soupe was founded in 2014 by Cincinnati chef and restaurateur Suzy DeYoung, daughter of chef and restaurateur Pierre Adrian of The Maisonette. After 25 years in the restaurant industry, she was experiencing burnout and realized what she really enjoyed about cooking was feeding people. She read a Facebook post from a local teacher describing students so hungry they had trouble climbing the school's staircase. DeYoung that same day took lunches of soup and fruit salad from her restaurant to the school, sending students home with quarts of soup for their families, and soon after changed her restaurant's business model to one in which the restaurant donated a quart of soup to a local nonprofit for every quart purchased by a customer. She converted the restaurant to a nonprofit after realizing she could not continue to self-fund the effort. As of January 2019 the organization estimates they have accepted donations of of discarded food and donated 357,000 meals. In February 2019 they estimated they accept of perishables and provide 3000 servings to partner agencies each week using six burners and a tilt skillet in a space. In 2019 La Soupe announced they were planning to move to the Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati, which is a food desert. The new space is in size and will contain kitchen, a carryout counter, and teaching space. The move is planned for September 2019. Model alt=many stacked boxes of tomatoes and other produce in a cramped kitchen, and a man clad in overalls writing on a clipboard La Soupe partners with local restaurants, farms, bakeries, grocery stores, and food pantries to accept donations of still-usable ingredients that would otherwise be discarded and delivers them to local chefs who prepare meals in their restaurant kitchens. DeYoung describes the process as \\"a less glamorous, industrial-scale version of Chopped,\\" a television show that gives chefs minutes to prepare dishes from a mystery box of random ingredients. After volunteer drivers have delivered donations, volunteer chefs must quickly develop recipes to use them. La Soupe volunteer drivers then pick up and deliver the prepared meals to schools, churches, food pantries, and homeless shelters for distribution. Meals are usually soups, usually accompanied by a mixed salad and rescued baked goods, because soup is stretchable and can be reheated in a microwave or on a hotplate by someone with no cooking skills. The organization works primarily with volunteers and a paid staff of 11. The organization operates a take-out business in a \\"poor, rural area\\" east of Cincinnati to bring in operational funds. In 2017 The Cincinnati Enquirer dining editor Polly Campbell called La Soupe's business model \\"so unique and effective that the nonprofit was honored recently with an award that is thought of as the U.S. Nobel Prize for public and community service,\\" the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Outstanding Public Service Benefiting Local Communities, one of five honorees nationwide that year. Programs =Ongoing= La Soupe's \\"Bucket Brigade\\" consists of a network of restaurateurs, including more than 60 local chefs, who accept donations through La Soupe and use their own surplus ingredients to make soup in their own restaurant kitchens. La Soupe volunteers pick up and distribute the prepared items to local nonprofits. \\"Soupe Mobile\\" is a food truck with a \\"pay what you can\\" pricing model. \\"Cincinnati Gives A Crock\\" provides cooking lessons and a crockpot to teens. =Ad hoc= In January 2019 La Soupe coordinated with Cincinnati State's Midwest Culinary Institute to offer eat-in or pickup meals to furloughed government workers.

She is best known for her work as a plus-size model, as well as her activism for diversity within the fashion industry. In September 2019 she was announced as the presenter of new BBC podcast Fashion Fix, a podcast about the Fashion Industry.  Modelling  Howard has worked for numerous brands and fashion campaigns, including Maybelline, Redken, British Vogue, Allure magazine and Pat McGrath. She is one of the faces of Pat McGrath's beauty line and considered a \\"McGrath Muse\\". Howard had tried, unsuccessfully, to model in her teens, being rejected from numerous agencies. At 21, she was signed to a London-based agency after her friend submitted her Facebook photos without her knowledge. In 2015, Howard was dropped by her then-London model agency for allegedly being \\"too big\\" to model. In response to being dropped, she wrote a lengthy Facebook post that subsequently went viral, with thousands of shares, with Howard appearing on Channel 4 news to share her side of the story. Upon hearing about the post, New York-based model agency Muse Management signed her, and Howard moved to New York. Controversially, Howard is considered a \\"plus size\\" model, despite only being a UK size 10-12/US 6-8. In an interview with Hello! magazine, Howard is quoted as saying, \\"I've got a D cup boob, I've got a size 10 to 12 hip - well, a 12 probably - and I've got a tummy that never seems to go away, no matter how many sit-ups I do... I'm curvy, but I know that I'm not a plus- size model and I've not given myself that term. That's what other people label me.\\" In January 2019, Howard was announced as the new face of global lingerie brand, Agent Provocateur.  Books  Howard published two books in 2018: Splash, a middle-grade novel surrounding issues such as bullying, friendships and body image, and Misfit, a memoir about Howard's battles with eating disorders, OCD, and anxiety. Howard told the Guardian newspaper that she wishes to ‚Äúcreate strong literary characters for girls‚Äù in her books. Misfit was published in February 2018 by Penguin Random House. In it, Howard describes her battles with eating disorders and other mental illnesses, including anxiety and depression. Howard's first children's novel, Splash, was published by Nosy Crow books in July 2018. In an interview with Hello! Fashion Monthly magazine, Howard says she wrote the book \\"to pass the time\\". Author Jacqueline Wilson described Splash as a \\"much-needed book that will strike a chord with so many girls - and help them dare to be different.\\" References Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century British women writers Category:British female models ","title":"Charli Howard"},{"id":"59629220","text":"The ScholarShare Investment Board is a body established by the State of California to set the investment policies of, and oversee all the activities of, ScholarShare, the state‚Äôs 529 college investment plan, as well as the Governor‚Äôs Scholarship Programs and also the California Memorial Scholarship Program.

Development At the end of 1935, the Air Service Command of the Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned the Yokosuka Navy Technical Arsenal to carry out aerodynamic research with a parasol monoplane similar to the Parnall Parasol, but not related. The aircraft was built by Watababe, starting in November 1937 and completed by September 1938. Receiving the designation \\"MXY1\\" (M (Special Purpose), X (Experimental), Y (Yokosho)), it was a parasol monoplane with a large glazed cabin, accommodating the pilot and 3 or 4 flight test observers. The aircraft was powered by a Nakajima Hikari 1 kai engine with a long-chord NACA cowling. Rectangular wings were supported by large struts and the wheels of the strutted undercarriage were enclosed in large spats. The tests showed poor performance of the aircraft, as well as a serious problem with vibration of the aircraft. Several months of work were spent on fixing deficiencies, but in the end the aircraft was abandoned, with parts being used in other research. In parallel, work was conducted on almost identical MXY2, but due to the closure of the project, development was axed.

The fortress is documented during the reign of Mircea the Elder (1394) and was built on the Danube line for the defense of Wallachia against the Turkish peril. At the end of the reign of Mircea the Elder, under unclear circumstances, it came under Ottoman occupation to return to the possession of Wallachia only in 1829 when it was burned and demolished. It is part of the historical monuments list in Teleorman County. Starting in October 2018, it is in a process of restoration and consolidation.  History  = First attestation (1394‚Äì1395) and the Battle of Nicopolis (1396) = Following the great Ottoman offensive in the fall of 1394, when the battle of Rovine took place, Mircea the Elder was removed from the throne of Wallachia and replaced by Vlad I (1394‚Äì1396) with Turkish help. As a result, in July 1395, a Hungarian expedition led by the Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxembourg aimed on removing Vlad and replacing him with Mircea on the throne of Wallachia succeeded only into conquering the fortress of Turnu. A faithful garrison to the king was left in the city, which disturbed his Wallachian ally. In this context, the first attestation of the city, dating back to 1397, appears in a diploma by Sigismund of Luxembourg, when the battles carried here between 1394 and 1395 are mentioned: > \\"After our accession to (Wallachia), we flew the Romanians and the Turks > with their captains and took the blood of the Nicopolis minor fortress, > located in Wallachia, with great bloodshed.\\" Battle of Nikopolis, 25 September 1396 Throughout the following year, in 1396, the struggles for the removal of Vlad, supported by the Turks, continue, being interrupted only by the King's participation with his vassals, including Mircea the Elder, at the Nicopolis crusade. During this expedition the territory of Wallachia was bypassed, given the important Wallachian and Ottoman military force stationed here. Instead, the Danube route was chosen. thumbleftPlan of the medieval fortress Holavnic (Nicopolis minor) In 1396, Stibor of Stiboricz, the Transylvanian voivode, together with Mircea go to Wallachia, defeated Vlad I, reclaimed the citadel at Turnu, and crossed the Danube to Nicopolis to take part in the crusade. It is likely, due to its proximity, that the fortress played a significant role during the Battle of Nicopolis on September 25, 1396, when a Franco-Wallachian Army commanded by Sigismund of Luxembourg was defeated by the Turkish army led by Bayezid I. In the context of his anti-Ottoman struggle Mircea the Elder participates personally with an army corps at the Nicopolis crusade. The Wallachian army, made up of light cavalry was not invited to take part of the first attack along with the heavy cavalry and withdraws without entering the battle. In another document by Johann Maroth in 1404, Sigismund also tells how Baiazid I invaded Walachia, deserted it, took the fortress of Nicopolis minor (Turnu fortress) from Prince Mircea by force and left his troops as a garrison. Other documents from Sigismund's time, written between 1406 and 1408, mention the battles for the little Nicopolis from 1394 to 1395. = Transformation into Turkish Raya (1417) = The Turnu fortress played an important role in the defensive system of Wallachia, especially during the reign of Mircea the Elder, when the ruler raised the shield against the Ottoman threat in the south of the Danube. This fortress along with Giurgiu, Turtucaia and BrƒÉila from a chain of fortifications along the Danube. In 1417, towards the end of the reign of Mircea the Elder, the Turnu fortress will become Ottoman, being transformed into a Turkish raya like a niyabet from the Nicopolis sanjak, subjected to the pasha of Silistra, along with all the territory within a 15 km radius around the tower. Turnu raya was established after 1419 and included the Turnu fortress and the villages of FlƒÉm√¢nda, MƒÉgurele, OdƒÉile, Ciuperceni, Craba and G√¢rla. Within the rayas, the Turks had established garrisons by which they constantly supervise Wallachia and Moldova, collect accurate information about the state of affairs and act in case of need. The armed forces cantons here were especially prepared to intervene at the slightest sign of disobedience. In addition, they have the advantage of being directly supported by the Turkish naval fleet. To each raya there was added more or less extensive territories, comprising several villages, which had the task of maintaining the garrisons. For example, Turnu had 3 villages, Giurgiu 25, and BrƒÉila about 50 villages. Because they were located in very good commercial areas, the rayas were used for trade between the Romanian countries (almost monopolized by the Ottomans) and the Ottoman Empire. Here taxes were collected or goods were being stored. The Wallachian rulers held a diplomatic agent called capuchehaie in each raya of the country's territory. The rayas in Wallachia do not seem to have been turned into military feuds; they constituted territories owned by high-ranking state officials. Thus, in the 17th century Giurgiu was given the command of the Danube fleet of war; Turnu was in the possession of a member of the sultan's family. = The Battle of Turnu (June 1462) = During the reign of Vlad ≈¢epe≈ü and in the context of his conflict with the Ottoman Empire, the Turnu fortress is for a short time under Romanian rule. Vlad »öepe»ô organizes a surprise campaign south of the Danube in the winter 1461/1462 when the Nicopolis fortress was conquered and over 20,000 Turks were killed by Wallachians. Following the raids of the Wallachian army south of the Danube, sultan Mahomed II decided to attack Wallachia and headed a large army to Targovishte. The Sultan went to Wallachia in April 1462 with an army of 80,000 to 100,000 soldiers. The official scribe of the great vizier Mahmud Pasha, a direct participant in the events, presents a very well- organized force, equipped with armed men with shining armor. Vlad has been gathering his troops on the Danube since May 15, aiming to prevent Ottoman troops from entering the country. The Ottoman troops attempted to cross the river in early 1462 at Nicopolis-Turnu, but they did not succeed because the Wallachian army was waiting on the left bank. After they passed, the Ottomans attacked Vlad Tepes' army, but they were repulsed. The Romanians counterattacked but were stopped by the fire supported by the 120 bombs. »öepe»ô ordered a withdrawal and adopted the tactic of leaving the Ottomans to starve and thirst and attacking them by surprise. In front of a superior army, the Wallachian ruler withdraws the people to the mountains and forests, and attracts the Ottomans inside the country through continuous harassment. His objective was to find a good place for the surprise attack, which will take place near T√¢rgovi≈üte on June 17, 1462. Battle of Giurgiu ‚Äì Woodcut(1596) = Michael the Brave conquers the fortress (1594‚Äì1595) = In the context of the Ottoman Power rising a \\"Holy League\\" was created as an alliance between the Christian countries struggling to stop the expansion of the Ottoman Empire to Western Europe. The accession of Wallachia to the \\"Holy League\\" led to the outbreak on 13 November 1594 of an anti-Ottoman rebellion that resulted in the killing of all the levantine creditors and the entire Ottoman garrison stationed in Bucharest. On this background, known as The Long War, prince Michael the Brave starts a general offensive against the Turkish Empire attacking the Ottoman fortresses on both sides of the Danube (Giurgiu, H√¢r≈üova, Silistra, etc.). The campaign of harassment of the Turks from the north of the Danube led to the Ottoman withdrawal in the cities along the river, where, taking advantage of the stationing of Ottoman troops in the winter camps in the Belgrade area, the Romanians attacked the Giurgiu and Turnu fortresses and managed to release civil settlements. In January 1595 all the left bank of the river was under Romanian control. Turnu remained under Wallachian command during Michael the Brave's reign. The fortress fell under Turkish control after the death of Michael the Brave on the C√¢mpia Turzii on August 9, 1601. Nikopolis and Turnu fortresses by Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli (1726) = Iancu Jianu's outlaws (1809) = In 1809, Iancu Jianu's outlaws raided the Turkish citadels on south of the Danube when Vidin and Plevna were being burned, killing the Turkish population in response to the actions of the Vidin pasha Osman Pazvantoglu who had attacked Craiova and burned the villages of Oltenia. Jianu's Oltenians destroy the Turnu fortress, which had become the incursion base when Osman Pazvantoglu attacked Wallachia. = Returning to Wallachia (1829) = Following the Russian-Turkish War of 1828/1829, the Adrianople Peace Treaty of 1829 established that the border between the Ottoman Empire and Wallachia was to be fixed on the Danube, so that the fortress of Turnu, together with the Braila and Giurgiu rayas, definitively returned to Wallachia. Upon returning to Muntenia, the Turnu fortress was demolished, burned, and the territory of the former raya was incorporated into Wallachia. After the demolition in 1829, the ruins of the fortress were used as construction material for locals and local authorities. The settlements of Turnu raya are embedded in the Olt County.  Archeological facts  Archaeological research has shown that the fortress consisted of a central tower, an enclosure wall that surrounded the tower about 6 m away from it and a defense ditch bordered on the inside by a wall and on the outside by an escarpment. The central tower had a diameter of 17.40 m and a wall thickness of 3 m. It stored ammunition and grain and was covered with tiles. The wall had an irregular polygonal route, and its thickness varied between 4 and 5 meters. On it there were placed massive bastions. The wall that bordered the interior of the defense ditch was 1.50‚Äì2 m thick and included an access area from which a drawbridge descended. There was a counter-escarpment on the outside. In a document found and dated 1397-1398 it is called \\"Holavnic\\". The same name appears in 1531 in a map of Johann Homann in the form \\"Cholonic\\", with the notation: Nicopolis Minor. A document of Alexandru Aldea from 1432 mentions the fortress of Pirgos (\\"Tower\\" in Greek has the form Pyrgos), identifying with the fortress of Turnu. Gh. I. Cantacuzino, suggests that he designates the fortress of Pirgos on the right bank of the Danube. In foreign documents up to the 16th century, the fortress appears exclusively called \\"Little Nicopol\\", as a pendant of the fortress on the other bank of the Danube. The Turnu fortress is recorded by August Treboniu Laurian in the Historical Store for Dacia from 1846 stating that the fortress was built on the ruins of a Roman tower. The manuscript Archaeological Excursion (1869) by Cezar Bolliac (a copy from the late 1930s according to the text published in the Official Gazette no. 222-224) describes a campaign of archaeological excavations 4 decades after the fortress was abandoned. Bolliac's observations and actions from the fortress of Turnu concluded that this was in fact the Roman fortress of Romula. From his description we notice two aspects: the fact that Cezar Bolliac is one of the first, if not the first archaeologist who demolished the old tower and that, although \\"I could not find anything around it\\", he could undo it on all sides so that \\" its outline is taken.\\" In fact, the material used to build the first phase of the fortress, during the period of Mircea the Elder, was brought from the former Roman camp at Oescus, located south of the Danube, as Grigore Florescu would later suggested.

History Hebbard was born in Bendigo, Victoria, in July, 1862, the fourth son of Mary \\"Martha\\" Hebbard, n√©e Kitto, (15 September 1827 ‚Äì 12 December 1920?) and John Hebbard (c. 1823 ‚Äì 20 August 1886), a Cornish miner, who married in England in 1847. :The Hebbards arrived in Australia around 1848 for employment at the great copper mine at Burra, South Australia. It was there that their sons William and John Henry and daughter Sarah Jane were born. Around 1855 they joined the exodus from South Australia to the Victorian goldfields, and spent some time at Fryer's Creek, near Castlemaine, then around 1861 settled at Bendigo. Hubbard was educated at Kennedy's Collegiate School and the Bendigo School of Mines, then at age 16 began night work underground at the United Hustlers and Redan mines at Long Gully, Bendigo, taking his classes during the daytime. He also worked at Johnson's Reef Extended whose manager was Richard Pope, and whose daughter he later married. In June 1884 Hebbard began work underground at the Hen and Chickens mine, Broken Hill, when the famous W. R. Wilson was manager. He had only been there a few weeks when Wilson recommended him to Crisp Brothers as manager of their Lubra mine at Purnamoota. Hebbard took the job and held it for six months. In 1885 Hebbard returned to underground mining for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company under general manager William Jamieson and mine manager Sam Sleep and was soon promoted to underground foreman. Then at the end of 1885 he took a managerial position with the Britannia and Scotia Silver Mining Company; six months later he had returned to his post with BHP. Early in 1886 Jamieson, Wilson, Sylvester Browne and some others founded the Broken Hill Junction Silver Mining Company, and in January 1887 appointed Hebbard mine manager. In October 1888 he was appointed manager of Tom's Lewis Ponds Silver and Gold Mining Company at Lewis Ponds Creek, Orange, New South Wales. In 1891 he accepted a Government job as Inspector of Mines, hailed by the press as a good appointment. :This was a stressful job. A disastrous mine collapse occurred in the South mine in July, 1895, when eight men were killed. :A catastrophic fire occurred at the Proprietary Block 11 mine that same year, when a great deal of effort had to be put in before the fire was extinguished and the mine made safe. In 1901 he left the Public Service for the Sulphide Corporation's Central Broken Hill Mine as assistant general manager to C. F. Courtney, whom he succeeded in 1903, when Courtney became general manager of the Corporation in Australia. At some stage Hebbard moved into the Central Mine Manager's Residence on Piper Street, South Broken Hill, now on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. The mine was periodically affected by \\"creeps\\" (ground movements) which resulted in destruction of the mill, threatened other buildings on the town side of the workings, and resulted in the death of at least one man. At great expense they rebuilt the mill, administration block, power house, and all other such facilities on the South Broken Hill side of the mine. The gamble paid off, as no further such losses occurred. In 1902 the Central Mine was the first on The Barrier to exploit the new magnetic separation process for refining zinc ore. It worked sufficiently well to justify doubling their capacity, but was no help with \\"slimes\\", which remained an intractable problem. Courtney, while in England during 1903‚Äì4 sent out a model plant to demonstrate the Cattermole process of froth flotation, which promised to separate heavy ores from the lighter stuff. In 1905-1908, Hebbard was manager of the Central Mine when he replaced the Cattermole process with the Minerals Separation's flotation process, the first industrial scale test of the froth flotation process. Minerals Separation, Limited in London discovered the process, and sent staff to Broken Hill to build the plant. Hebbard in an article published in the Proceedings of the Australasian Institute of Mining Engineers detailed the Sulphide Corporation's Central Mine plant and the evolution of the process, a revolutionary method of extracting metals from low grade, complex ores. The article was reprinted in 1915, after the process had been successfully introduced in United States and South American mines. Hebbard also improved the Minerals Separation machine, called a cell, as the Hebbard Subaeration cell, used throughout the world.

Emami works on low-power mixed-mode circuits in scalable technologies. She is Executive Officer of the Department of Electrical Engineering and an investigator in the Heritage Medical Research Institute.  Early life and education  Emami was born in Nain, Iran. She studied at an all-girls high school, where she became interested in hardware design. She earned her bachelor's degree in electronic engineering at the Sharif University of Technology in 1996. During her undergraduate degree she created a high performance synthesizer with Direct Digital techniques. She joined Stanford University for her graduate studies, earning a master's degree in 1999 and a PhD in 2004. At Stanford University she was a member of the very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) research group, where she worked on integrated circuits and system design. She joined the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 2004, working on communication technologies. She was an Assistant Professor at Columbia University from 2006 to 2007. Her early work used simulations and measurement to evaluate CMOS technology operating at sub-Nyquist rates.  Research and career  Emami joined the California Institute of Technology in 2007. She was awarded a National Science Foundation CAREER Award to investigate integrated systems in 2008, studying the electro-optical connects in integrated systems. She was awarded an Okawa Foundation grant in 2010, allowing her to investigate the design of high performance sensors. In 2015 Emami was appointed as a Principal Investigator of the Heritage Medical Research Institute. Emami's work involves the design of energy efficient ways to interface the information and physical worlds. Her research group, MICS (Mixed-mode Integrated Circuits and Systems), study circuits for data communication, sensing and biomedical devices. She focusses on low-power consumption devices, such as microdevices that can act as photoreceptors for people who suffer from vision loss. She achieves low power consumption by using clocking techniques. The photoreceptor-like devices can transmit information to the retinal nerves, and, crucially, can operate at low power as any overheating may damage human tissue. In a collaboration with the Doheny Eye Institute, Emami developed retinal eye implants that were based on ultra-low power flexible circuits. The circuits included hundreds of electrodes that could be used to stimulate the cells in the eye. Designing electronic components for the eye is not trivial - unlike most circuitry, they cannot be flat. Emami collaborated with an origami expert to develop an implant that could match the contour of a retina. Following this project, Emami worked with Yu-Chong Tai to create intraocular pressure sensors that can monitor eye pressure in patients who suffer from glaucoma. To ensure the sensors are biocompatible, Emami encapsulated them in 'Parylene-on-oil', a silicone-oil bubble surrounded by Parylene. Working with Axel Scherer, Emami has developed an implantable glucose monitor that can transmit information via bluetooth to a wearable reader. The sensors can alert physicians in the event of a blood sugar dip or spike. One of her undergraduate students proposed a way for the glucose sensor to operate on low-power, using an analog to digital conversion. In her position at the Heritage Medical Research Institute, Emami creates microdevices that can be used to monitor health and provide treatment inside patients' bodies. Emami has developed a biosensor that can continuously monitor vital information, including blood sugar, pH levels and cortisol, as well as acting as a therapeutic system, releasing insulin or other medicine. She collaborated with Mikhail Shapiro to develop a device called 'Addressable Transmitters Operated as Magnetic Spins' (ATOMS), which uses principles of magnetic resonance imaging to locate the device in the human body. The ATOMS chips contain integrated resonators, sensors and wireless transmission technology, which allows them to be located using magnetic fields. Her group are currently evaluating the performance of ATOMS in vitro and in vivo, monitoring device migration in live mice and creating the platform that will allow navigation in high-precision surgery. She has also investigated efficient neural interfaces. In 2017 Emami was appointed the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering at CalTech. The Chair is endowed by the co-founders of Panda Express. = Academic service = Emami is the Associate Editor for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Journal of Solid State Circuits and has served as the IEEE SSCS distinguished lecturer. She serves as the Executive Officer of the Department of Electrical Engineering at CalTech. Alongside her academic research, Emami works on initiatives to improve diversity in engineering.

Beta Israeli women left their homes and stayed at the hut during menstruation, until they could ritually purify themselves at the river and return home. A menstruation hut is a place of seclusion or isolation used by certain cultures with strong menstrual taboos. The same or a similar structure may be used for childbirth and postpartum confinement, based on beliefs around ritual impurity. These huts are usually built near the family home, have small doors, and are often dilapidated, with poor sanitation and ventilation, and no windows. The Nepali version, the Chhaupadi, is probably the best-known example, but cultural attitudes towards menstruation around the world mean that these huts exist, or existed until recently, in other places as well. The use of menstrual huts continues to be the cause of death, from exposure, dehydration, snake bite, smoke inhalation, and so on. The use of these huts is illegal in some places. Use in various cultures According to the tradition of chhaupadi, Hindu women in western Nepal are forced to reside in a small hut, called a Chhau Goth, for 5 days during menstruation. However, the tradition requires those menstruating for the first time to stay in the hut for at least 14 days. In some communities, these huts may also be used by pregnant women to deliver babies. The huts may be made of mud and stones and may have roofs made of grass. Normally, they do not have windows, and the women must sleep on straw on the floor covering themselves with a thin blanket.http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Water/ContributionsStigma/others/field_bulletin_- _issue1_april_2011_-_chaupadi_in_far-west.pdf In a Nepali survey around 2017, one district with around 49,000 households had over 500 of these huts. The practice of using menstruation huts was made illegal in 2005 by Nepal's supreme court. During their first menstruation, young Aborigine women in Australia live in menstruation huts built by their mother. After her period ends, she bathes in the river and the hut is burned down. In Yap (part of Micronesia), after giving birth, women and their newborn babies spend time in a menstruation hut while the father has a holiday. The Yurok women of California lived in menstruation huts built near the main house.Kroeber, A. L. 1925. Handbook of the Indians of California. Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin No. 78. Washington, D.C. In Judaism, when a woman becomes niddah (cast out during menstruation), she may remain in a niddah hut for some of the time. These huts are absent in Israel, but exist in the Ethiopian highlands. The women must stay in the hut, usually located on the margins of the village, for seven days. Women there report negative as well as positive views on the practice. Some describe fear, cold, and lack of food, while others enjoy the social interaction, relaxation, and rest. While in these huts, the women can not cook, apart from coffee and the roasting of grain. Others may bring food to them, but while doing so they take care in avoiding physical contact. The P√°ez people of the southwestern highlands of Colombia were known to use menstruation huts.

The crimes have been regarded as \\"Liberia's most notorious ritual killing case\\" due to the number of murders, the involvement of high ranking government officials and their subsequent public executions. History Between 1965 and 1977 over 100 murders occurred in Maryland County, many of which were killed ritualistically due to the mutilation and removal of body parts. During the 1970s, Liberians in Maryland County were constantly under the threat of ritual murders. Between November 1976 and July 1977, 14 people had disappeared in the county prompting Liberian president William Tolbert to fire Superintendent of Maryland County, James Daniel Anderson, who failed to report the missing people. Tolbert publicly declared \\"Anyone who kills deliberately: The law will kill that person\\". These murders went unreported and uninvestigated until the murder of a local fisherman and popular singer, Moses Tweh. Tweh was abducted on June 26, 1977. His body was discovered on July 4, 1977, heavily mutilated with his eyes, ears, nose, tongue and penis removed. Prior to the discovery of Tweh's body, Wreh Taryonnoh, the girlfriend of Assistant Supervisor of Schools, Francis Nyepan, was allegedly heard by a group searching for Tweh saying that \\"if they would be so lucky to find him, only his bones they might see\\".

She specializes in painting and ceramic sculptures made out of clay and terra-cotta. Velarde focuses on the themes of gender and the repercussions of colonization on Latin American history, with a particular interest in Peru. Her ceramics consist of unusual body positions, childlike faces, and works that have been molded from her own face as well.  Biography  Kukuli Velarde was born in Cusco, Peru, to an anthropologist mother and a father who held high expectations for her. At a young age, Velarde started to express herself through art, particularly painting, even getting to the point of being recognized as a sensation because of her advanced skills. Though recognized as a talented painter, Velarde felt pressure to continue doing art, which led to her having a fallout with her craft. During 1984, Velarde lived in Mexico and attended the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City, allowing her to reconnect with art. In 1988, she headed to the United States, where she continued her artwork by creating ceramic sculptures and received her Bachelor in Fine Arts from Hunter College in New York.  Career  Velarde primarily uses clay to create sculptures that depict contorted bodies. Mainly using red clay, Velarde creates ceramics that depict Pre-Columbian times and the aftermath of colonization. Creating sculptures with distorted faces and sometimes angry expressions represents the emotions of Latin Americans during colonization. By using her face as a mold to express the resistance and rage of her ancestors, Velarde in a way is sticking to her Peruvian roots. Velarde also chooses to use clay for her work because of the personal connection she feels to it, since red clay is known to have been traditionally used in Pre- Columbian Peru.  Artwork  = We, The Colonized Ones= From 1990-1992, Velarde worked on and exhibited her series We, The Colonized Ones in New York. For the collection Velarde used red and white clay ceramics, which scholar Fernando Torres Quir√≥s stated was meant to convey the emotions of the indigenous under the domination of Europeans. He further stated that Velarde paid special attention in portraying the pain of her ancestors by focusing on facial features. Per Ivor Miller, traditional methods of ceramics, such as unglazed sculptures, are incorporated into this series, purposely showing a disconnection to Western methods. The series also includes short performances and installations, the former of which includes Velarde utilizing her ceramics and herself to show a story of colonization in Peruvian history. = Plunder Me Baby = Plunder Me Baby (2007), a series of ceramic sculptures, is one of Velarde's works that has been shown in different exhibitions throughout the United States and Peru. The American Museum of Ceramic Art, explains Velarde's inspiration for this show as a childhood memory where her nanny denied her indigenous roots by claiming she couldn't speak the Inca language Quechua, which later prompted her to create sculptures as a way to address the discrimination indigenous people face. Art editor Janet Koplos, describes the series as consisting of brown, red, and white clay or terra-cotta, painted over with geometric shapes while portraying contorted bodies with detailed human like faces molded from the artist's own face. Visual arts editor Leah Ollman, adds that the whimsical facial expressions of the sculptures also portray a comedic feel, meant to depict Velarde's satire take on Latin American colonization. This series is also a commentary on women's bodies and female sexuality by displaying female body parts. = The Complicit Eye = Velarde's most recent work, The Complicit Eye, displayed at the arts organization Taller Puertorrique√±o in Philadelphia, PA (November 2018 to February 2019), is the artist's first solo painting show in the U.S. The Complicit Eye considers the female body and beauty standards in terms of patriarchal society through self portraits from the last 14 years. Taller Puertorrique√±o explains how the exhibition comments on society's definition of femininity and its relation to Latina bodies, specifically in Western culture where Latin American women are expected to look a certain way. Paintings included show female bodies with different ideas of femininity, such as \\"pin up\\" style and \\"goddess\\" like features that show sculpted legs and exaggerated breast size, with the face of the artist attached. Some of the works included are life sized portraits while others have a comic book feel, displaying the different art styles Velarde worked with. The paintings also incorporate Velarde's identity as a Peruvian, mother, and artist. Examples of the pieces included in the exhibition are Pinup Wannabe (2005) and Superperuvian (2005).  Collections  Velarde's work has been held at the Latino cultural arts center, Taller Puertorrique√±o, the American Museum of Ceramic Art, the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, Peter's Projects art gallery, and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  Awards  Velarde is one of the 2015 recipients of the Guggenheim Fellowship, given out by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation for her excellence in the fine arts. She was also the Evelyn Shapiro Foundation Fellowship recipient (1997-1998). This fellowship allowed Velarde studio space in The Clay Studio in Philadelphia and a solo exhibition. Here she displayed her exhibition Isichapuitu, which consisted of Pre-Columbian inspired ceramic pieces that told an old Peruvian folk tale about the resurrection of a female spirit.

It is a campus novel and satire of American university culture, particularly the culture wars. It was reviewed in several major national newspapers and magazines, and its themes of multiculturalism and multilingualism have been the subject of academic analysis.  Plot summary  Benjamin \\"Chappie\\" Puttbutt, a professor at Jack London College in Oakland, California, becomes the target of racist attacks from the Neo-Nazi editor of the campus newspaper. Worried that he will lose his middle-class lifestyle if people see him as a black activist, Chappie responds by recommending to the campus president that nothing be done. Instead, he focuses on learning Japanese using the textbook Japanese by Spring, which he is studying with Mr. Yamato, a Japanese-language teacher, in the belief that speaking Japanese will give him an advantage when the rising Japanese economy results in Japanese companies and culture taking over large parts of American society. One day Chappie discovers that Japanese investors have purchased the college, and that his Japanese teacher is the new college president. Based on their personal connection, Yamato appoints Chappie to a new administrative position, from which he begins to take revenge against every aspect of the college that has bothered him, including unproductive tenured professors, overpaid fad-pursuing intellectuals, and the political activists who have opposed Chappie's tolerance of racism on campus. Yamato follows his own plans to reform Jack London College as a bastion of Japanese nationalism, including renaming the college after Japanese war heroes and creating a Pearl Harbor Day holiday. Chappie's fortunes change again when Yamato is arrested for plotting to overthrow the Japanese Emperor. Ishmael Reed, a new character, follows the news as Chappie denounces Yamato. Reed then reports a series of observations and visions: Americans enact white affirmative action laws to oppose the Japanese; Japanese investments and dominance begin to decline; and a new multiculturalism based on Yoruba culture begins to arise in America.  Major themes  Academic analysis of the book has focused on its use of satire to criticize monoculturalism and illustrate the value of multiculturalism. Kenneth Womack's academic analysis of Reed's insertion of himself as a character into Japanese by Spring suggested that Reed's literary technique was meant to elevate his own multiculturalist perspective over any form of monoculturalism, including Eurocentrism, Afrocentrism, and feminism, with the result that Reed's novel could also be criticized as misogynist. In a Modern Fiction Studies analysis of the novel's themes of multiculturalism, Jeehyun Lim proposed that the use of different languages in the novel reflected Reed's ambivalence toward capitalism, observing that Japanese by Spring presents a multiculturalism grounded in the Yoruba language as an alternative to a multiculturalism based on multilingualism in English and Japanese, the languages of competing capitalists. Crystal Anderson analyzed Japanese by Spring as a form of trickster narrative, in which the story creates meaning from the experiences of a particular ethnic group, but also \\"privileges access to and use of multiple cultural spheres\\". However, Anderson criticized Reed's use of Japanese characters simply to support a story about Blacks and whites in the United States, noting that Japanese by Spring relied on \\"prejudices of a different era\\" rather than directly confronting Black-Japanese relationships with realistic characters and cultural representations.  Background  Reed wrote several novels in the 1980s and 1990s that addressed the rise of neoconservatism and multiculturalism in American politics and academic life, and Japanese by Spring has similar settings and characters to predecessor novels The Terrible Twos, Reckless Eyeballing, and The Terrible Threes, with especially strong plot similarities to Reckless Eyeballing. According to Reed, Japanese by Spring was inspired by a news story about a major university that had been secretly funded by a Japanese organized crime syndicate. Using a Japanese takeover of an American university as a \\"science-fiction element\\", he wrote Japanese by Spring to challenge the idea of multiculturalism as a response to Afrocentric and Eurocentric perspectives.  Reception  The book received mixed reviews. Reviewers praised Reed's courage in tackling difficult subjects, with the Chicago Tribune saying \\"Reed isn't foolhardy, but he is about as brave as can be\\". The New York Times concluded that \\"this clever, outrageous novel is just the sort of weapon we need in the war against academic pedantry\\". However, reviewers also criticized the book's ending, with The Washington Post noting that Japanese by Spring \\"lapses into the kind of artless agitprop that still too much afflicts even newer generations of the old Negro Problem Novel\\", and The Times Literary Supplement concluding that \\"if this writing is jazz-like, it's an improvised set that keeps forgetting what tunes it started out being based on\\". Reviewing the book for the academic journal MELUS, international relations scholar Tsunehiko Kato criticized Reed for exaggerating and mischaracterizing Japanese right-wing movements, and for creating \\"the impression that he is the only one doing the right thing\\", ultimately concluding that Reed's understanding of Japan was based on \\"sterotypes of old Japan\\" and an unhelpful portrayal of modern Japan in terms of its economic relationship to the United States.

The inauguration involved the swearing-in of Nicol√°s Maduro for his second term, and, especially within the context of Maduro's election, has been controversial and contested by various figures and organizations.  Election  On 20 May 2018, elections were held across Venezuela to elect the President to take office in January 2019. These elections were initially scheduled for December 2018, but were rescheduled twice by Maduro‚Äîthe incumbent‚Äîin a move seen as limiting the ability of other candidates to run. The Constituent Assembly announced the election, although it did not have the power to do so constitutionally.  Several of the main opposition candidates, such as Henrique Capriles, Leopoldo L√≥pez and Antonio Ledezma, were disqualified from running. The official turnout reported by the National Electoral Council was 46.07%. The Democratic Unity Roundtable estimated the turnout at 25.8%, based on its quick count estimates. Maduro dismissed allegations of foul play, and stated that \\"the opposition must leave us alone to govern\\". The contention around the legitimacy of the inauguration was primarily based on the unusual activity of the election. Several Venezuelan NGOs, such as Foro Penal Venezolano, S√∫mate, , the Venezuelan Electoral Observatory and the Citizen Electoral Network, expressed their concern and cited the lack of the Constituent Assembly's competencies to summon the elections, impeding participation of opposition political parties, and the lack of time for standard electoral functions, and many countries worldwide, such as the European Union, Latin American governments and the United States, declared that the election was illegitimate.  Inauguration  The Supreme Court chamber during the ceremony Maduro's inauguration took place on 10 January 2019 in the Supreme Court building in Caracas. The Venezuelan constitution specifies that inaugurations should be conducted by the National Assembly, at the Federal Legislative Palace. The Maduro administration views the National Assembly as being \\"in contempt\\", so his inauguration was officiated by the Supreme Court instead. Maduro was sworn in by Maikel Moreno, President of the Supreme Court, at 3:00pm; he ignored calls from the Lima Group to hand over power to the National Assembly until another election could be held. Before the stage, a large military parade‚Äîwhich had moved through Caracas‚Äîtook place on Avenida Bol√≠var, and the military gave its inaugural pledge of undying loyalty to Maduro for his six-year term. At the start of the inauguration, Maikel Moreno went blank and stuttered, having forgotten what to say, before looking to the side and continuing. Maduro gave an 80-minute address to those gathered, in which he stated: \\"We are a true, profound, popular and revolutionary democracy [...] I, Nicol√°s Maduro Moros, am a genuinely and profoundly democratic president.\\" He also directly threatened Colombia, the United States, and Europe, telling the latter to \\"respect Venezuela [‚Ä¶] or sooner rather than later you‚Äôll pay the historical price\\". He also criticized his own party and political affiliation, saying that his plan for his second term was to \\"correct the mistakes of the Bolivarian Revolution\\", and that \\"corrupt chavistas\\" are actually his greatest threat. Maduro said that 94 countries were present at his inauguration, but this count included the members of international organizations like the African Union and the Arab League. The number of UN-recognized countries who sent representatives to the inauguration act was 17: Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador and South Ossetia sent their presidents; Turkey and Suriname sent their vice presidents; Belarus, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines sent their prime ministers; and Antigua and Barbuda, China, Dominica, Granada, Iran, Mexico and Saharawi sent diplomatic representatives. Palestine and South Ossetia, which are not officially-recognized members of the UN, also sent representatives. = Support = Maduro supporters at the inauguration S√°nchez Cer√©n of El Salvador greets Maduro The \\"small\\" crowd gathered for the inauguration showed \\"little support\\"; this has been compared to the large crowds present at Maduro's first inauguration. Ricardo S√°nchez, a member of the Constituent Assembly, said that there was obvious national support for Maduro at the inauguration, and that \\"[the government is] convinced that the majority of the people who voted for the president in May are united today with loyalty and discipline to be with Nicol√°s Maduro for another six years\\". It has also been reported that some people present at the inauguration were forced to appear, including all those who work for the government; one woman told The Guardian that she had been forced to attend. She also said that despite working in a government Ministry, she isn't paid enough to feed her family, and is planning to leave the country as soon as possible. Others at the inauguration were present because they believe in Maduro; one laborer said he can \\"identify with Maduro because he's a humble man\\" and shares his ideology. In addition, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan voiced solidarity with Maduro, and Cuban President Miguel D√≠az-Canel, Bolivian President Evo Morales, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, President Salvador S√°nchez Cer√©n of El Salvador, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis Timothy Harris and Vice President of Suriname Ashwin Adhin attended Maduro's swearing-in ceremony among representatives of other countries. = Criticism = Antonio Ledezma along Spanish politicians in Madrid after Maduro's inauguration. Protests were reported in several Venezuelan states, including Lara, Zulia, Trujillo, and in the capital city Caracas. Several cacerolazos were reported in many areas of Caracas, including near the Supreme Tribunal, where Maduro was sworn in. Large protests also took place in Miami, United States, an area with a large Venezuelan migrant population, as well as a dozen other nations worldwide, including multiple protests across Spain and its islands. Protests also took place in cities such as Barcelona, Bogot√°, Buenos Aires, Lima, London, Madrid, Ottawa, Paris and Quito.  Response  A Miami protester dressed as a caricature of Maduro National Assembly 16 January vote on denouncing Maduro Many nations and supranational bodies did not recognize Maduro as a legitimate President, including the Lima Group and the Organization of American States. John R. Bolton, U.S. National Security Advisor, said, \\"The US will not recognize the Maduro dictatorship's illegitimate inauguration.\\" In response, Maduro said during his inauguration that the United States and Lima Group's lack of recognition was turning his ceremony into \\"a world war\\". On 11 January, Russia accused the US of attacking Venezuela's freedom. In response to Maduro's inauguration, Argentine President Mauricio Macri stated \\"Venezuela is living under a dictatorship\\". South African President Cyril Ramaphosa congratulated Maduro following his inauguration. On 11 January, Venezuelan ministers claimed there were violent attacks on the Venezuela Embassy in Lima, Peru. Peru and Paraguay closed their embassies in Venezuela and recalled diplomats, and Paraguay also removed Venezuelan diplomats from its own country. Peru also barred Maduro and 100 other Venezuelan politicians from entering the country, and Argentina similarly banned the entry of Venezuelan government personnel. As a collective, the Lima Group announced that if Maduro took office they would ban travel to their nations and stop military cooperation, supposedly tactics designed to turn the Venezuelan military against their leader. Mexico abstained from the group announcement, with new president Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador citing the non-intervention policies of his government. In response to the group's announcement, Maduro threatened them with \\"diplomatic measures\\" if they didn't revoke the resolution. David Smilde from the Washington Office on Latin America had said despite preemptive threats from the Lima Group, he didn't expect any of the member countries to actually remove embassies. Instead, he thought that they would simply tell Maduro that he is illegitimate and that they would be ignored. However, the Lima Group did follow through with their threats, and Smilde suggested that this action would make Maduro and his allies \\"fret\\". In a foreign ministry statement, Brazil called on \\"all of the world's countries\\" to \\"stop supporting [Maduro] and come together to liberate Venezuela\\". On 7 January 2019, several days before the inauguration, Supreme Court Justice and member of the Electoral Commission , who had previously been aligned with Maduro, defected to the United States, calling Maduro \\"incompetent\\" and the elections \\"unfair\\". In response, the government said that Zerpa had fled the country in order to escape charges of sexual harassment. US intelligence also suggested that there was more fracturing within Maduro's close ranks, and that his general Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez had threatened to resign if Maduro took office. Though many called for power in Venezuela to be deferred to the National Assembly, Phil Gunson of the Caracas Crisis Group said that the opposition, which has the Assembly's majority, was not united well enough to bring the failing state into prosperity. Economically, Maduro's continued rule has led experts to estimate that Venezuela would experience at least 23 million percent inflation by the end of 2019. = National Assembly responses = UCV during the inauguration Juan Guaid√≥, the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, gave a speech in the Assembly after Maduro's inauguration. In no uncertain terms it called for a reclamation of power, and declared that Venezuela was technically without a leader, stating that \\"today there is no head of state. Today there is no commander-in-chief\\". Beforehand, the opposition had called on the people to protest during the inauguration, and they boycotted it. Students took part in one protest led by Rafaela Requesens and Guaid√≥'s Popular Will party, blocking off a road and again calling Maduro a \\"usurper\\". In an official statement on the day of Maduro's inauguration, Guaid√≥ announced a state of emergency, emphasizing the need to recover control by uniting the people, foreign allies, and the military. He expressed anger that Maduro continues to \\"dismantle\\" the rule of law and that Venezuela has ended up with a de facto government. In response to Maduro's \\"usurpation\\" he then proposed on behalf of the government \\"to declare the usurpation of the office of the President\\", saying \\"we call on those soldiers who wear their uniforms with honor to step forward and enforce the Constitution [...] we ask citizens for confidence, strength and to accompany us on this path.\\" He also said that Maduro's inauguration was a \\"coronation of paper\\", and defied the idea that Maduro could fully disband the National Assembly, which he said he would. From its opening on 5 January, the National Assembly has been formulating plans to implement a transitional government, before taking back control. On 11 January, Guaid√≥ summoned an open cabildo (Spanish: Cabildo abierto); the term roughly translates as a \\"town hall meeting\\", but cabildos abiertos were historically convened for more emergent or disastrous matters. At the open cabildo, the National Assembly announced Guaid√≥'s assumption of presidential powers and duties.

Moreover, they demanded the prosecution of those responsible for the deaths which have occurred due to the repression. There have been at least 481 deaths according to the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (ANPDH). The Movement held President Daniel Ortega and Vice President/First Lady Rosario Murillo responsible ‚Äúfor any act that infringes upon ours and our families‚Äô constitutional rights and guarantees.‚Äù The Movement invited the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua to participate in the dialogue with the government and affirmed that from the UPOLI they would continue ‚Äúresisting until the demands are met.‚Äù Amaya Coppens one of the leaders of the movement was chosen as an International Woman of Courage in March 2020 by the US Secretary of State.

County Council elections Severn is a county electoral ward for elections to Monmouthshire County Council. At the 1995 and 1999 elections the ward elected two Labour Party county councillors. From the 2004 elections representation was reduced to one councillor. This has been Cllr Jim Higginson, a steelworker and trade union official, who has represented the ward since 1999. Cllr Higginson was elected as chairman of the county council in May 2016.

It is currently available for Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera. RoBhat Labs, a company founded by two undergraduates at University of California, Berkeley, who had previously developed software that identified bot accounts on Twitter. It was released in August 2018 after a presentation at the Aspen Ideas Festival. The creators liken it to antivirus for Internet users' news feeds. The extension works by comparing images that appear in the browser to a database of images culled from a hundred trusted news or fact-checking sites, such as Time and Snopes.com. If an image has been altered or has been identified as being used to mislead elsewhere online, a pop-up informs the reader of this. SurfSafe has already received recognition by universities who provide resources to students on how to avoid fake news, such as the University of Akron School of Law. While SurfSafe has been well-received, it has also been criticized for limited effectiveness and for being a technological solution to a human problem. Neal Krawetz, an expert in network security and image analysis, has gone further, not only saying that SurfSafe does not come anywhere near doing what it claims, but recommending against installing it due to privacy concerns. History In 2017, Ash Bhat and Rohan Phadte, both undergraduates at the University of California, Berkeley, began developing online tools to help combat the spread of misinformation on the Internet. The first, NewsBot, was an app for Facebook Messenger that attempts to identify the political leanings in a news story. The second, BotCheck.me, was developed as an extension for Google Chrome. It uses machine learning and natural language processing to assess the probability that a Twitter account is a bot spreading political propaganda. Users who installed it saw a button on every Twitter account's page that they could click to determine the probability it was a bot. Within a year of its deployment, BotCheck had managed to flag almost a million accounts as bots. Bhat and Phadte believed that their model, which attempted to identify and differentiate between human and bot posting patterns, had achieved a 93.5% accuracy rate. But at the same time they had noticed another problem: Many of the bots were sharing altered images to support their positions, and it was hard to identify them. The problem was compounded by the use of unaltered images that were represented as being about something other than what they depicted. In response to that problem, Bhat and Phadte developed SurfSafe. With the extension enabled, a user can hover their mouse over a photograph; it will then be compared to others in a data base of hashes of all the images on every page any browser with the extension has visited and those hosted on a list of a hundred websites considered to be trusted sources. RoBhat believes that if it can get several hundred thousand users to install SurfSafe it will, through this method, accumulate a data base of a hundred billion images within a year. It also analyzes any text on the page and compares it with text on pages where the image has also appeared. Users can also click on a button if they believe the picture has been manipulated or misleadingly used. Once SurfSafe has done those comparisons and searches, it will then place an icon at the corner: a check mark if the image appears to be genuine, a warning sign if it might be suspect, and an X if it has been identified elsewhere as altered; in the latter instance it also shows the original image. Other than Snopes.com, users may select their own group of websites, mostly those of major news organizations, from which to check content. RoBhat's founders introduced SurfSafe at the Aspen Ideas Festival in June 2018. Two months later they made it available to the public. At the time, it was only available for Google Chrome; later, versions were developed for Firefox and Opera. Criticism While much of the initial news coverage of SurfSafe was positive, at least expressing approval of the idea behind the extension, even some of those reviewers were skeptical that SurfSafe (and some other competing products) could solve the problem all by itself. Wired noted that the underlying problem is digital literacy. \\"It's a bit of a leap to expect someone whose main window to the internet is Facebook to take the additional step of installing a fact-checking plug-in.\\" Nor was the extension available for any mobile platform, although RoBhat said it was working on that. Others noted that the user's ability to select all the sites besides Snopes that they considered reliable for the purpose of evaluating an image's authenticity was problematic, as some of the sites users had the option of choosing were outlets that have been accused of intentionally propagating fake news, or allowing their sites to be used for it, in the past. \\"With these publications in the user's circle of trust, SurfSafe's effectiveness may be blunted before it can make a difference in the user's perception of who they're getting their news from\\", The Verge wrote. But Bhat did not consider that a serious flaw. A user who had chosen to trust only those sites considered dubious, he had told The Atlantic when the extension was presented at Aspen, would eventually notice that the news from those sites conflicted with each other and might thus start to doubt their reliability. \\"People will move closer to the objective truth\\" he argued. However, he allowed, if SurfSafe started to develop a community that elevated less reliable news outlets to a position of high trust, RoBhat would update its models. He also responded to this criticism in The Verges story on SurfSafe by saying that news outlets with contrasting political viewpoints nevertheless often agree on the basic facts of stories they report on, making it unlikely that such an echo chamber would develop among the extension's user community. Bhat himself acknowledged to Wired another flaw, a limitation resulting from the data base SurfSafe uses. If the extension encounters a picture that no other user with it enabled has seen, it cannot make any call on the image's authenticity and will mark it as genuine. However, he considered that a small problem, since the images the extension aims to spot are those that spread virally, meaning many people will be looking at them in a short period of time. The Verge also tested SurfSafe at doing what it was supposed to do and found it came up short. It tested on two widely circulated altered images: one a Seattle Seahawks player apparently burning an American flag as his teammates cheered in the team's locker room (the flag had been added to the original image, which had merely showed him dancing), and another of Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor and gun control activist Emma Gonz√°lez tearing up a copy of the U.S. Constitution (it had actually been some shooting targets). While SurfSafe easily recognized the most widely circulated copy of the first image, it did not similarly flag variants, which had also widely circulated on Facebook, that had been cropped or were screenshots of the image taken from elsewhere. It was even less successful with the Gonz√°lez image, recognizing no variant, not even screenshots on the Snopes page debunking the image. On his blog, Hacker Factor, Neal Krawetz, an expert in network security and image analysis who operates the FotoForensics.com website, took a very negative view of SurfSafe. Acknowledging that it was a response to a real problem, he warned that it was complex and that \\"this desire for a fast, simplified solution opens the door for lots of snake-oil solutions and charlatan products.\\" Krawetz excoriated other publications that had written positively about SurfSafe, suggesting they had only rewritten the press release announcing its release instead of downloading it and reviewing it. Krawetz reiterated the criticism that SurfSafe's reliance on crowdsourcing for suspect images both presented an easy avenue for an organized attack with the intent of subverting its intended purpose and did not guarantee that it would favor the spread of accurate images. \\"Regardless of whether I think the BBC is good journalism or you think Fox is trustworthy, this says nothing about whether the reporting is actually accurate.\\" In tests he also found that the extension did not recognize identical versions of the same image when it encountered them on different pages with different URLs. However, Krawetz did not find these to be the primary reason he recommended readers \\"stay away\\" from SurfSafe. During his tests, the developer panel on Chrome revealed that the extension was querying his browser for the URL and all images on every page he visited to store in RoBhat's own servers. This, he noted, would include not only private images that might be on the same page as an image a reader was querying SurfSafe about, but URLs to those images, URLs that might even have credentials or tokens embedded within, since even the HTTPS protocol would not prevent them from being passed along in response to a query (Krawetz did allow that SurfSafe appeared to strip out those credentials from URLs of its stored images when displaying them publicly, but noted that in turn made for broken links should users try to visit those sites to assess the images' authenticity themselves). Conversely, Krawetz noted, anyone looking into the domain name, which had only been registered the month before, would learn very little about RoBhat Labs or even who owned the name. Nor did the getsurfsafe.com website identify anyone involved with the company: \\"They don't list any of their people and there's no 'About Us' or 'Who we are'\\". He learned more about these things from the company's press release than its website. \\"When it comes to trustworthiness, I have a lot of issues with site owners who don't identify themselves on their sites.\\" See also *List of fake news websites *List of Firefox extensions *Fake news websites in the United States *Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy, where a manipulated photo had political impact References External links * Category:Google Chrome extensions Category:Mozilla add-ons Category:Fake news Category:2018 establishments in the United States Category:2018 software ","title":"SurfSafe"},{"id":"59630217","title":"Becoming Astrid"},{"id":"59630222","text":"IBM Q System One is the world's first-ever circuit-based commercial quantum computer, introduced by IBM in January 2019.

Paulo Mendoza, a 31-year-old Mexican illegal immigrant, was arrested three days later. Prior to his arrest for the murder of Singh, Mendoza was found guilty of multiple offenses.  Incident  Singh grew up in the town of Naitata, Navua, Fiji. He emigrated to California in 2003 with his family. He attended police academy and joined the Newman, California Police Department in 2011. While working overtime on Christmas Day, Singh was shot by a motorist whom he had pulled over because he appeared to be driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.California authorities arrest, identify suspect and 7 others in officer's shooting death The shooter drove off and was captured after a 55-hour manhunt.  Suspect  The accused murderer, a citizen of Mexico, was in the United States illegally, and had previously been charged with driving under the influence. He was wanted for failing to serve his sentence on two previous charges. Although the suspect had identified himself as Gustavo Arriaga Perez, his real name was Paulo Virgen Mendoza, born December 28, 1986. Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson stated that the suspect had twice been arrested for driving under the influence, and that he spoke openly about being affiliated with a gang. His first arrest, for a felony DUI with an injury to a man, was on August 14, 2011. He was arrested on a second misdemeanor DUI on June 5, 2014. A court sentenced him to serve five days in jail, and three years of probation for the 2011 DUI, as well as to enroll in a DUI program. However, he never showed up, and the warrant was still outstanding when he shot Singh four years later. The suspected shooter was scheduled to appear in court in January 2015 to be arraigned for his second DUI case, but court records reveal he never showed up. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. He appeared in court on January 2, 2019 and was charged with the murder of Officer Singh, although the trial was suspended temporarily for a mental health evaluation requested by his attorney. Mendoza was cleared by psychiatrists to stand trial on April 2, 2019. On April 11, 2019, Mendoza pled not guilty to the murder.  Political attention  President Trump drew attention to the crime immediately after the arrest, and in a January 9, 2019 in an address from the Oval Office on the need to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, saying, \\"‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border,... The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.‚Äù Singh's brother, Reggi Singh, accompanied President Trump on a visit to the Mexican border in Texas. Stanislaus County Sheriff Christianson said that, ‚ÄúLaw enforcement was prohibited because of sanctuary laws, and that led to the encounter with Officer Singh,... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law enforcement wasn‚Äôt restricted, prohibited or had their hands tied because of political interference.‚Äù The case has been compared to the 2015 Shooting of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco and the 2018 Killing of Mollie Tibbetts in Iowa. Nicole Malliotakis wrote that \\"Corporal Singh's name must now be added to the growing list of Americans that includes Kate Steinle, Kayla Cuevas, Nisa Mickens, and Mollie Tibbetts, who were all killed by individuals who were unlawfully in our nation. The most recent victim, 22 year-old Pierce Kennedy Corcoran, was killed by an unlicensed and uninsured illegal immigrant driver on the last Saturday of 2018 in Knoxville, Tennessee. The simple fact is, if we had stronger border security in lieu of sanctuary policies that protect those in our country illegally, these six young (average age 23) Americans, would still be alive today.\\" Former California Governor Jerry Brown denied that the Ronil Singh's death had anything to do with California's new sanctuary law.

Biography  Born in London to Scottish parents, Paton converted to Christianity in spring 1905 in his first year studying at Pembroke College, Oxford and joined the Presbyterian Church of England. He quickly became involved in itinerant preaching in country churches around Oxford and the activities of the Student Christian Movement of Great Britain, and pursued theological studies at Westminster College, Cambridge. Paton worked as a Presbyterian missionary in India, first from 1916 until 1919, then returning in 1921 and becoming the first general secretary National Christian Council of India (1922‚Äî1926). He became part of the International Missionary Council, succeeding J. H. Oldham as general secretary, then helped to establish the World Council of Churches with Willem Visser 't Hooft. In 1911, Paton married Grace Mackenzie MacDonald. She was the daughter of a minister of a Presbyterian Church in London where Paton had been invited to preach at. Grace would later leave the Presbyterian Church, then the Church of England because they did not care for the poor. She converted to Roman Catholicism in 1936.

Imido ligands can be terminal or bridging ligands. The parent imido ligand has the formula NH, but most imido ligands have alkyl or aryl groups in place of H. The imido ligand is generally viewed as a dianion, akin to oxide.

It is the first in a series of four books. It was published by Delacorte Press on November 6, 2018. Skyward is set in the same universe as Sanderson's short story Defending Elysium, which details events hundreds of years before the events of Skyward.Skyward Denver signing Defending Elysium is available on Sanderson's website and contains spoilers for Skyward. Plot summary Spensa is a 17-year-old girl who is part of a group of shipwrecked humans living on a ruined world called Detritus, under constant attack from mysterious aliens called the Krell. Spensa dreams of following in the footsteps of her deceased father, a fighter pilot of the Defiant Defense Force (DDF). However she is barred from any chance at becoming one because her father abandoned his flight in the infamous Battle of Alta, which ended in his own wingmates shooting him down. In order to get accepted into the flight academy, she and her peers must take an exam to prove their worth. Spensa, who has been preparing for the exam her entire life, has high hopes to pass, as does her longtime friend Rodge. However, on the day of the testing, DDF Admiral Ironsides rigs the exam so that Spensa fails. Angry at her defeat, she surreptitiously retakes the exam after everyone has left. Cobb, her father's former wingmate and an instructor at the academy, spies on her and sees her near-perfect score, so he offers her the opportunity to come train under him. At the academy, Spensa is introduced to her fellow cadet crew who, at Spensa's recommendation, name themselves the Skyward Flight. Their members are Spensa, Rodge, Kimmalyn (nicknamed Quirk), Hurl, FM, Nedd, Arturo, Morningtide, Bim, and Jorgen (nicknamed Jerkface by Spensa). After training in a virtual reality simulator, they are suddenly called to the battlefield to aid against a Krell incursion. Rodge is left scared, and quits the flight academy to instead become an engineer. Spensa is barred from using academy facilities and quarters, so she occupies a nearby cave, where she discovers an advanced crashed ship with an artificial intelligence computer. Spensa, with the help of a cautious Rodge, begins to work on repairing the ship. In the meantime, Spensa and her cadet flight crew continue to learn and practice new techniques under the guidance of Cobb. Spensa begins to bond with her classmates. Spensa is eventually able to power the ship, after stealing a power module from Jorgen's hover car, which introduces itself as M-Bot and explains that it was left in the cave by its former owner. However, M-Bot's memory banks are corrupted and it remembers little, beyond orders to lie low and not reveal itself to the public. Skyward Flight is called into action again, and Bim and Morningtide are killed in the subsequent battle. As they further their training, they are called upon more and more, but also lose numbers. Nedd quits after his brothers are killed in combat. Hurl crashes and dies, prompting Kimmalyn to also quit. Arturo is pulled by his worried parents. Spensa, with Jorgen's help, cremates Hurl at her crash site and recovers the booster from Hurl's ship which Rodge uses to repair M-Bot's flying capabilities. She acquires a recording of the Battle of Alta, which reveals that her father did not desert, but rather turned on and attacked his fellow pilots. Cobb explains that his turning was the result of \\"the Defect\\", a mental power which is genetic. Spensa has occasional disturbing visions, which her father supposedly also saw. During her next battle, Spensa is shot down, and ejects in order to save her own life. Ironsides uses this \\"cowardice\\" as an excuse to remove Spensa from the Academy. On graduation day, Ironsides mobilizes all her pilots to battle the Krell for a valuable piece of fallen space salvage. While the pilots are distracted, a Krell bomber launches an attack from the opposite direction. Spensa uses a damaged fighter to assault the bomber, but is shot down again. She crashes, but Cobb brings M-Bot to her, and she uses its advanced capabilities to destroy the bomber and save the DDF. She travels with M-Bot into space, where her Defect allows her to hear and intercept Krell communications. She returns to the planet to report that the Krell are actually a coalition of aliens intent on keeping humans trapped on Detritus, though they are now actively trying to exterminate humanity. Characters * Spensa Nightshade (Spin): The daughter of an infamous coward, Chaser, who is desperate to prove her own bravery and become a pilot. When she is finally accepted into the DDF, Ironsides makes becoming a pilot extremely difficult. She is also Cytonic. * Captain Cobb (Mongrel): Spensa's academy flight instructor and the former wingmate of her father. Cobb walks with a permanent limp, curses often, and is cynical of the DDF's current strategy for training new recruits. * Jorgen Weight (Jerkface): A wealthy student who is named the flight leader for Spensa's Skyward flight. Jorgen's by-the-book approach to piloting leads to constant clashing between him and Spensa, and she nicknames him Jerkface because of this. * Admiral Judy Ivans (Ironsides): The head of the DDF, a hero of the Battle of Alta. Ironsides has taken a specific interest in hindering Spensa's chances at becoming a pilot. * Rodge McCaffery (Rigmarole/Rig): Spensa's childhood best friend, who joins the academy and Skyward flight with her, but secretly harbors interest in becoming an engineer. * MB-1021 (M-Bot): A highly advanced starship of a mysterious origin, with an intelligent but quirky AI. Spensa discovers M-Bot in a cave near the DDF's Alta Base, and reactivates him with the help of Rodge. * Kimmalyn (Quirk): A member of Skyward flight who becomes fast friends with Spensa. Kimmalyn often quotes the Saints, even though she makes up most of what she says. While she is less skilled as a pilot than others, she is an expert markswoman. * Hudiya (Hurl): A member of Skyward flight with an aggressive yet passionate outlook on flying. * Freyja (FM): A member of Skyward flight who disagrees with the aggressive, warrior culture that the DDF has created. * Nedd Strong (Nedder): A member of Skyward flight and friend of Jorgen and Arturo. * Arturo Mendez (Amphisbaena): A member of Skyward flight and friend of Jorgen and Nedd. * Morningtide: A member of Skyward flight who struggles with speaking English. * Bim: An overeager member of Skyward flight. * Gran-Gran: Spin's grandmother who tells her stories of Old Earth, which motivates Spin. Her mother worked on the flagship and took them to Detritus. Reception Skyward debuted on the New York Times Best Sellers list as number three in the Young Adult Hardcover category. Publishers Weekly praised the fearless heroine and memorable cast and liked how the cliffhanger ending sets up the next novel. Sequels In December 2018, Sanderson confirmed in his yearly \\"State of the Sanderson\\" that the second book entitled Starsight was currently finished and awaiting final revisions. It was released on November 26, 2019. Starsight follows Spensa and her peers as they continue investigating the mystery of the Krell and her defect. Books 3 and 4 are expected to be released in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

McDonald is primarily known for her influence in the field of rock art research and her collaborative research with Australian Aboriginal communities.  Education  McDonald received her undergraduate training at the University of Sydney and her PhD from the Australian National University. Her PhD research, titled Dreamtime Superhighway: An analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange, supervised by Andree Rosenfeld, Isobel McBryde, and Anthony Forge was completed in 1994 and a revised and expanded version was published by Terra Australis in 2008. This work was influential in demonstrating the cultural and social influence of rock art through research in the Sydney Basin. Her doctorate research also helped to create an understanding of radiocarbon direct-dating on pigment rock art, an innovation in Australian archaeology.  Career  McDonald's early career was as a cultural heritage consultant primarily based in New South Wales. McDonald was Director of Brayshaw McDonald Pty Ltd before founding her own company Jo McDonald Cultural Heritage Management Pty Ltd. In addition to her research in the Sydney Basin, her work as a consultant on the Cumberland Plain in Western Sydney, which focused on the excavation and management of open stone artefact sites, was particularly influential. As a consultant, McDonald was also involved in the excavation and subsequent research into Narrabeen Man. McDonald has worked at the University of Western Australia as the Director of the Centre for Rock Art Research + Management since 2012. In that same year she was appointed as the Rio Tinto Chair of Rock Art Studies, which she held until 2017.  Research  During her time as a consultant, McDonald was involved in The Canning Stock Route: Rock Art and Jukurrpa Project, an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project focused on documenting the cultural heritage along the Canning Stock Route in collaboration with local Aboriginal communities. In 2012, McDonald published with Peter Veth A Companion to Rock Art, an edited volume that provided the first global synthesis of rock art research. McDonald's research has focused on the archaeology and rock art of people living in deserts and arid regions, particularly the Western Desert of Australia and the Great Basin of America. From 2012 to 2014, she held an ARC Future Fellowship exploring how rock art changed in these two arid areas in response to environmental changes. Together with Peter Veth, McDonald has undertaken research into the relationship between rock art and social networks in Pilbara and the Western Desert in 2013. Further work in the Western Desert gave clues into the ways in which groups of people moved across the landscape due to environmental changes and the ways that movement can be examined through their rock art. McDonald's current research has focused on the archaeology and rock art of the Dampier Archipelago (known to local Aboriginal communities as Murujuga), especially as a Chief Investigator of the Murujuga - Dynamics of the Dreaming project funded by the ARC from 2014 to 2016. McDonald has also contributed to the recent push towards the World Heritage listing of Murujuga.  Awards  In 2016, McDonald was awarded the Rhys Jones Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Australian Archaeology by the Australian Archaeological Association (AAA); the association's top honour. And in 2018, McDonald was awarded the Bruce Veitch Award for Excellence in Indigenous Engagement, which is awarded annually by the AAA \\"to any individual or group who has undertaken an archaeological or cultural heritage project which has produced a significant outcome for Indigenous interests\\". McDonald is also a life member of the Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologists Inc. (AACAI) and served as President of AACAI from 1993 to 1997.

Developed by the United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory, it was the fourth in both the SOLRAD and the GRAB (Galactic Radiation and Background) programs. The satellite was to be orbited along with ionospheric study satellite Lofti 2, the United States Army's range calibration satellite Secor, Navy surveillance calibration satellite Surcal, and the University of Iowa's Van Allen Belts-studying Injun 2 satellite. This unprecedented five-in-one mission, called \\"Composite 1\\" and \\"Buckshot\\", ended in failure on January 24, 1962 after its Thor DM-21 Ablestar 's second stage failed to deliver the payloads to orbit. Background The United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) established itself as a player early in the Space Race with the development and management of Project Vanguard (1956‚Äì59), America's first satellite program. After Vanguard, the Navy's next major goal was to use the observational high ground of Earth's orbit to survey Soviet radar locations and frequencies. This first space surveillance project was called \\"GRAB\\", later expanded into the more innocuous backronym, Galactic Radiation and Background. As American space launches were not classified until late 1961, a co-flying cover mission sharing satellite space was desired to conceal GRAB's electronic surveillance mission from its intended targets. The field of solar astronomy provided such cover. Since the invention of the rocket, astronomers had wanted to fly instruments above the atmosphere to get a better look at the sun. The Earth's atmosphere blocks large sections of sunlight's electromagnetic spectrum, making it impossible to study the sun's X-ray and ultraviolet output from the ground. Without this critical information, it was difficult to model the sun's internal processes, which in turn inhibited stellar astronomy in general. On a more practical level, it was believed that solar flares directly affected the Earth's thermosphere, disrupting radio communications. The Navy wanted to know when its communications were going to become unreliable or compromised. Sounding rockets had shown that solar output was unpredictable and fluctuated rapidly. A long-term, real-time observation platform above the Earth's atmosphere ‚Äì in other words, a satellite ‚Äì was required to properly chart the sun's radiation, determine its effects on the Earth, and correlate it with ground-based observations of the sun in other wavelengths of light. Thus, the SOLRAD project was conceived to address several NRL goals at once: * to make the first long-term continuous observations of the sun in ultraviolet and X-ray light, and to correlate these measurements with ground-based observations. * to evaluate the level of hazard posed by ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. * to better understand the effect of solar activity (including solar flares) on radio communications. * to cheaply and efficiently produce a satellite for the GRAB surveillance mission by using a proven design. * to obscure the GRAB mission under a scientific cover. SOLRAD 4 had two successful predecessors in SOLRAD 1 and SOLRAD 3, both of which made significant contributions to the understanding of ultraviolet and X-ray astronomy in the previous two years, and which returned an abundance of intelligence on Soviet air defense radar installations. Spacecraft Like its predecessors, SOLRAD 4 was roughly spherical, modeled on the Vanguard satellite (which also had been developed by the Naval Research Laboratory), and included both the scientific SOLRAD and the electronic surveillance GRAB packages within the same satellite. Massing 25kg, the fourth in the SOLRAD series was more heavily instrumented than prior SOLRADS. Instead of one X-ray photometer, like SOLRAD and SOLRAD 2, or two, like SOLRAD 3, it carried four X-ray photometers, allowing it to detect more intense and higher energy X-rays. Three of the photometers were shielded against Van Allen radiation (which could spoil results) by magnets, as had been done on earlier missions. The fourth was protected by a beryllium shield. It was hoped that SOLRAD 4 would not only conduct basic research into solar X-ray astronomy, but also determine the hazard hard X-rays posed to astronauts and satellites. Another point of difference between SOLRAD 4 and its predecessors was its four Lyman-alpha detectors. Used for measuring ultraviolet radiation, two such detectors had been included on SOLRADS 1 and 2 to determine the impact of solar ultraviolet on radio reception. None had been measured, and the detectors had been deleted from SOLRAD 3. They were reinstated on SOLRAD 4 not for solar study, but for night-time measurement to see if ambient Lyman-alpha radiation constituted a threat to astronauts and satellites. Mission On January 24, 1962 at 09:30 UTC, SOLRAD 4 was launched via Thor DM-21 Ablestar from Cape Canaveral's Pad 17B along with ionospheric study satellite Lofti 2, the United States Army's range calibration satellite Secor, Navy surveillance calibration satellite Surcal, and the University of Iowa's Van Allen Belts-studying Injun 2 satellite. This unprecedented five-in-one mission, called \\"Composite 1\\" and \\"Buckshot\\", ended in failure: the Thor first stage performed properly, but the Ablestar second stage developed insufficient velocity to attain orbit. While the exact cause was not immediately known, there were indications that the Ablestar had not separated cleanly from the Thor stage, instead tumbling end over end. The estimated cost of the lost rocket and payload was $3.5 million. Legacy The SOLRAD/GRAB series flew once more (unsuccessfully), finishing with the SOLRAD 4B mission launched April 26, 1962. In 1962, all U.S. overhead reconnaissance projects were consolidated under the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which elected to continue and expand the GRAB mission starting July 1962 with a next-generation set of satellites, code-named POPPY. With the initiation of POPPY, SOLRAD experiments would no longer be carried on electronic spy satellites; rather, they would now get their own satellites, launched alongside POPPY missions to provide some measure of mission cover. Starting with SOLRAD 8, launched in November 1965, the final five SOLRAD satellites were scientific satellites launched singly, three of which were also given NASA Explorer program numbers. The last in this final series of SOLRAD satellites flew in 1976. In all, there were thirteen operational satellites in the SOLRAD series. The GRAB program was declassified in 1998.

She was a recipient of the Order of St. Sava. Early years and education Draginja Babiƒá was born in Valjevo, 3 October 1886, into a family of merchants, Janko Babiƒá and Jelena Jelka (n√©e Mi≈°koviƒá or Mitroviƒá. Her father was president of Valjevo municipality, 1892‚Äì1893, as was her brother, Marko Babiƒá, in the period before the Second World War. Her brother, Jovan Babiƒá, was a professor of Serbian language and a writer, and sister, Marija (married surname, Tadiƒá), was a pharmacist. In Valjevo, Babiƒá finished elementary school and lower gymnasium classes. In Belgrade, she graduated from the Third Belgrade Gymnasium in 1905. She began her medical studies at the University of Zurich in 1906. where she was a scholar of Valjevo municipality, continuing her studies from 1908/09 in Berlin and ended them December 1911. She was the first Serbian woman to complete medical studies at the University of Berlin, at the age of 25. Babiƒá became a doctor at a time when women doctors in Serbia were very rare. Because she was a great student, the faculty wanted to keep Babiƒá at the University of Berlin, but she decided to return to Serbia. Career Babiƒá began her career in Valjevo as an assistant doctor in the District Hospital, then she passed the state exam and worked as a municipal doctor. During the Balkan Wars, she served as director and was the only physician at Valjevo's Reserve Military Hospital. During World War I, she also worked in Valjevo as a doctor.

After the Battle of Kolubara, Babiƒá returned to Valjevo. At that time, there was a large epidemic of Typhoid fever in Serbia caused by interaction with the Austro-Hungarian soldiers. In the Valjevo hospital, the situation was particularly difficult and hundreds of people died daily. At the time when everyone was fleeing from Valjevo, Babiƒá returned to her hometown to help the sick. There she selflessly sacrificed herself for the good of others, herself suffering from Typhoid fever. Babiƒá was decorated with the Order of St. Sava in 1913.

Bladensburg Road NE, Benning Road NE, 15th Street NE, Maryland Avenue NE and H Street NE intersect directly, and to the immediate northwest of this intersection is the easternmost point of Florida Avenue. The name \\"starburst\\" refers to the star- like shape created by these roads when viewed on a map. The Starburst Intersection also serves as a demarcation point between four Washington, DC neighborhoods: Carver Langston to the northeast, Trinidad to the northwest, Near Northeast to the southwest and Kingman Park to the southeast. Neighborhood history and photos are captured on a Greater H Street NE Heritage Trail historical marker at the intersection. Transit The Starburst intersection is considered one of the city's most complicated, involving 10 lanes of traffic and 2 streetcar lanes. The DC Streetcar provides east‚Äìwest transportation along H Street NE and Benning Road NE in addition to two-way traffic. Maryland Avenue and Bladensburg Road are served by two-way traffic. 15th Street NE is one way traffic northbound. The area is served by Metrobus lines X1, X2, X3, X8, X9 and B2 and Capital Bikeshare. On January 10, 2019, ANC 6A voted to request \\"No Turn on Red\\" signs from DDOT at various points of the intersection. History Starburst Intersection in 1861 With the city of Bladensburg, Maryland founded in 1742, Bladensburg Road was an existing route from Bladensburg south to the Potomac River's \\"Eastern Branch\\" through the area that would later become Washington, DC. In the early 1800s, city leaders in Washington established a toll gate at the intersection to create a private toll turnpike to Bladensburg. In 1871 District officials made the Bladensburg Turnpike into a toll-free city street. Maryland Avenue, 15th Street, H Street and Boundary Road (later known as Florida Avenue) were part of the original L'Enfant Plan for Washington, DC, with this intersection depicted on the northern edge of the proposed map. Some variations of the map include a reference to \\"Old road to Bladensburg\\" at the intersection. \\"Benning's Road\\" appears on maps dating as far back as 1861 and was an important connection from the City of Washington to Benning Bridge crossing the Anacostia River.Lapp, Joe. Kenilworth: A D.C. Neighborhood by the Anacostia River (Humanities Council of Washington D.C. 2006), Accessed May 7, 2010 The land to the north and east of the L'Enfant Plan was farmland owned by William Corcoran. During the Civil War, the area was used as a temporary artillery military camp known as Camp Barry. From 1871 to 1899, Graceland Cemetery was located on a 30-acre plot on the northeast corner of the intersection between Bladensburg and Benning Roads. Upon closure of the cemetery, Maryland Avenue and adjacent streets were expanded through this location. In the 1920s, Sidney Hechinger purchased this property and used it as a lumberyard, warehouse and headquarters for his hardware business. When company operations moved to Maryland in 1975, his son John Hechinger decided to build a mall on the property to serve as \\"an oasis of retail shopping in a consumer market that was vastly under-served\\". Hechinger Mall opened in 1981 as the largest inner- city shopping center in the United States and remains an active retail location today. The Washington Brick Machine Company purchased 150 acres of land north of Boundary Road between present-day Gallaudet University and Bladensburg Roads in 1884. Later, this land would be sold and converted into American League Park, a baseball stadium that was home to the Washington Senators from 1901 to 1903. The Columbia Railway began horse car service along H Streets NW and NE in 1870, later switching to electrical streetcars. The line terminated at 15th Street NE. From 1908 to 1935 the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway provided passenger and freight service on an electrified route terminating at the Starburst Intersection.

Simmons (MC contract 888) was a Liberty ship built in the United States during World War II. She was named after Furnifold McLendel Simmons, a politician from North Carolina responsible for the disenfranchisement of African-American voters in that state, as well as head of a Democratic Party political machine until his death in 1940. The ship was laid down by North Carolina Shipbuilding Company in their Cape Fear River yard on January 13, 1943, and launched on February 10, 1943. Simmons was chartered to R.A. Nicol and Company by the War Shipping Administration until her sale to Maersk in 1947.  Cuban Convoy Attacked  On March 10, 1943 Simmons was loaded with explosives for Karachi, Pakistan as part of a Key West, Florida to Guantanamo Naval Base KG convoy escorted by United States Navy and Royal Canadian Navy vessels that was attacked by German submarine U-185. The tanker SS Virginia Sinclair had been sunk on March 9 when the U-185 returned and torpedoed the ammunition carrying SS James Sprunt. Flaming debris struck several vessels including the Simmons, causing part of her crew to abandon ship.  Refloating the SS Fairisle  On August 29, 1946 the Simmons was unloading cargo in Calcutta when she was sent to the aid of a stranded vessel, the SS Fairisle, that had grounded due to a navigational error. Reaching the scene of August 31, the crew spent five days attempting to put cables between the two vessels to pull the Fairisle off. The attempt succeeded on September 5, only after part of the Simmons crew had been forced onto the beach when their small boat overturned. Four officers and twenty-seven men sought compensation for their efforts in court from the Waterman Steamship Corporation and were eventually awarded a sum each.  M√¶rsk ownership  Simmons was purchased by A.P. M√∏ller in 1947 from the War Shipping Administration. At one point she was renamed Ellen M√¶rsk, then in 1948 Hada County, and finally in 1952 Comet. She was scrapped in 1968.  Awards  The Simmons Naval Armed Guard detachment received one battle star for World War II service during the invasion of Southern France.

The film was commissioned by the Documentary Channel and Canal D. Although the film's tone is satirical, the film presents serious scientific research then exclusive to the documentary indicating boredom impedes learning and may in fact be a state of stress. Synopsis The documentary examines how boredom negatively impacts health, driving people either to morbidity or high risk behaviours, possibly playing a part in the 2011 England riots, and in addiction, among other social problems. Nerenberg participates in a \\"boring\\" experiment conducted by researchers at the University of Waterloo, where he is made to watch a video of two men hanging laundry while his heart rate and cortisol levels are monitored. He finds himself bored within an extremely short time, and then anxious, nervous and uncomfortable, demonstrating that during boredom, cortisol hormone is released, an activity drug which creates stress. The documentary features statements from a variety of experts, from psychologists and neurologists to scholars on topics like education and technology, as the documentary examines how mass education in industrialized countries chronically bores students because of the essential sedentary nature of modern education, and our relationship with new technologies. Modern civilization actually promotes chronic boredom with stimulating media \\"that only appears to be exciting.\\" Interviewees include Jon Bradley, Alan Caruba, and Colleen Merrifield. Production =Inspiration= In a podcast interview with Doug Gordon, Albert Nerenberg states that he frequently makes films about \\"the obvious\\", things hiding in plain sight. While researching the science of fun, helost his iPhone for 48 hours, and had an acute sense of boredom and began wondering what it really was. In the course of investigating it, he was \\"shocked\\" to discover no documentary had ever been made on the subject of boredom, and that this led to the further realization that there was evidently very little research on boredom. In the podcast, he suggests the reason for the lack of research into boredom is that universities have a direct interest in \\"not delving too deep, because they themselves are great purveyors of boredom\\". =Financing= The film received funding from the Canada Media Fund, and the Rogers Documentary Fund. =Filming= Nerenberg uses a variety of filmmaking styles, from research presented by experts, to B-roll and stock footage, to dramatizations and what David King describes as Daily Show style interviews. Release Boredom had its world premiere at the Festival du nouveau cin√©ma in Montr√©al on 14 October 2012, where it was in competition with other films in the Canadian Focus section. It went on to be screened at the Visions du R√©el and DOXA Documentary Film Festivals in Nyon, Switzerland and Vancouver at the Vancity Theatre, in April and May 2013. A special Toronto screening following the presentation of the \\"Boring Awards\\" took place at the Royal Cinema on 21 May 2013. =Broadcasting= The documentary was aired on television in Canada on the Documentary Channel on 8 June 2013, and in French on Canal D later that summer. It was also broadcast internationally on Swiss and German TV, Channel 8 Israel, Finland TV1, and Sweden Educational TV. =Home media and streaming= Boredom was released on DVD on 27 November 2013 by Disinformation Video, and on all video on demand and digital platforms. Disinformation released a second DVD with bonus features on 12 August 2014, including deleted scenes, including a segment on the positive aspect of boredom: \\"If not for boredom, what motivates people to experiment and invent new things?\\" Another bonus is a version of the film sped up 10% \\"to combat the potential boredom of viewers\\". There is also a three- minute featurette on the stages of boredom and a four-minute feature on a proposed artificial mountain in an area of the Netherlands to add interest to the region's otherwise flat landscape. The documentary is available for streaming on Amazon Prime. Critical reception FNC co-founder and artistic director Claude Chamberlan called Boredom a \\"must see\\", while John Griffin, writing for the Montreal Gazette, called the documentary \\"hugely entertaining\\". Writer and critic Anne Brodie calls the documentary \\"vastly entertaining\\", with the caveat that the film is not a \\"real\\" study as much as a Reefer Madness kind of exercise: \\"Some academics are interviewed and medical facts are tossed around, which is all good, but at its heart this is just fun to watch.\\" David King, writing for Cinema Retro, agrees for the most part, contending the film misses the mark a little by giving equal weight to experts and \\"more anecdotal evidence on the effects of boredom,\\" and considers the film more infotainment than profound research. \\"In short, there are plenty of less interesting ways you could spend an hour than watching this film\\", adding that the film is \\"never boring.\\" C.S. Strowbridge, writing for The Numbers, is of two minds about Nerenberg's style, which \\"tends to be a little over- dramatic when talking about these subjects\\", but otherwise \\"this is a truly fascinating documentary. We do get some answers to a few of the questions that are asked, but the questions that we don't yet have answers to are just as intriguing.\\" Marketing and related works Stephen Harper was voted Most Boring Canadian Several months after the film's initial release, an event called the \\"Boring Awards\\" was organized in advance of the film's first Toronto screening. Winners included Toronto mayor Rob Ford (Least Boring Canadian), Prime Minister Stephen Harper (Most Boring Canadian) and Canada's capital city of Ottawa (Most Boring City in Canada). Nerenberg explained the process of determining the winners was not \\"rigidly scientific\\": > We open-nominated on Facebook, Twitter and on the web and about 17 cities > were nominated. We narrowed the field down to five. Then we looked at > substantiation. For example all the cities on the boring list are legendary > in terms of boredom. There's a film being made in Ottawa called The City > that Fun Forgot. Abbotsford is defined in the Urban Dictionary as boredom. > But Ottawa clinched mainly because the government there brags about how > boring it is. As well, Ottawa must have a greater marketing and > entertainment budget than any other city so it's boringness is less > excusable.

The story is centered on Alberto, a medical student who, upon seeing his brother killed after receiving a mysterious pack with a beetle inside, decides to investigate. Originally published in chapters in the magazine O Cruzeiro, between October 10 and December 26, 1953, O Escaravelho do Diabo achieved greater success by being republished in book in 1974 by Editora √Åtica, in the S√©rie Vaga-Lume (a youth literature series), created in January of the previous year, with illustrations of Mario Cafiero. The book as repinted for twenty-six editions.O Escaravelho do Diabo was selected for the National Program of Library of the School, in 1999, and received a film adaptation in 2016. Plot The story takes place in Vista Alegre, a small city in the interior of S√£o Paulo. It begins when the character Hugo, brother of Alberto, receives a mysterious package with a scarab (black beetle) inside. However, he is not interested in the origin of the gift, because he thinks it is a trick of his friends. The next day, Hugo is found dead with a sword nailed to his chest. Undeterred by the death of his brother, Alberto goes after the killer. Returning home, he noticed, in a magazine, a beetle similar to what Hugo had received, the name was Phanaeus ensifer, which means \\"sword bearer.\\" Then, he begins to delve into ancient objects in order to find the killer and prevent the next crime. After some time of searching, he found an [antiquarian] who sold the same sword, but the shopkeeper said he did not remember who had bought it. From there, Alberto comes to the aid of the renowned local inspector, Inspector Pimentel and the deputy inspector Silva. They realize that all the victims of this killer, which happens to be denominated \\"Insect\\", have something in common: they are all legitimate redheads, with hair that remember the color of the fire and freckles. Together, they are investigating a series of crimes that follow, trying to find out also the reason for Hugo's murder. In the course of the investigation, Alberto meets and falls in love with Veronica, a beautiful orphan girl who lives in the house of an Irishwoman named Cora O'Shea, along with other residents, and this hampers the investigation. The three men responsible for investigating the beetle case are becoming suspicious that the mystery solution is in Cora O'Shea's pension, but they can not get enough evidence and the case ends up being filed as \\"unresolved.\\" After years, on a trip to Europe, Alberto still thinks about regaining Veronica, and by chance, discovers who was the assassin of Hugo, and the reason of all this. ... the redheads still die.

It was originally installed in Portland's Battleship Oregon Park (now part of Tom McCall Waterfront Park). Designed by American artist Oliver L. Barrett, the memorial was erected in 1939, but disappeared in 1942 after being relocated temporarily during the construction of Harbor Drive. It featured a geometric tufa statue depicting a man not resembling Roosevelt, as well as a smaller realistic sculpture of him. The monument initially received a generally unfavorable reception, but was considered one of Barrett's best-known artworks. Description Dubbed the \\"Colossus of Portland\\", the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial was designed by Oliver L. Barrett (1892‚Äì1943), a sculptor and professor at the University of Oregon. The tall monument was made of Central Oregon red tufa, weighed , and commemorated veterans of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The monument featured a statue of a man not resembling Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States. According to Barrett, the modern work was \\"not designed as a likeness of Roosevelt or anyone else\\", but was rather \\"an attempt to symbolize his indomitable spirit‚Äîfighting, but constructive\\". According to Grant Butler of The Oregonian, \\"The statue wasn't a likeness of Roosevelt, but was a more generic figure that was meant to embody his spirit and determination, and was sculpted in the modern style\\". Barrett carved a smaller realistic profile of Roosevelt into the memorial's left side. An inscription on the base read: \\"Our nation holds in its hands the fate of the coming years\\". The monument has been described as \\"fascistic\\" because of its \\"severely geometric\\" contours. History The memorial was commissioned by Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War veterans wanting to commemorate Roosevelt. On July 17, 1938, The Oregonian published the University of Oregon's announcement of the project, which confirmed Barrett's ongoing work at the Central Oregon rock source, near Bend, Oregon. The university said Barrett was creating a \\"heroic\\" statue of a \\"symbolic, robed figure, holding a sword\\" for the park's entrance, and confirmed the monument had a depiction of Roosevelt on one side and a memorial legend on the other. The announcement said the statue would be tall and capture \\"the spirit of courage, determination and audacity that accompanied the battleship Oregon on its historic dash and that inspired Theodore Roosevelt and his gallant men in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican war\\". According to The Oregonian, the monument was erected \\"at the behest of the late Jay H. Upton, Bend attorney, the funds being derived from a residue of an appropriation to defray expenses of a Spanish‚ÄìAmerican war veterans' convention several years ago\\". Upton had also served as department commander of United Spanish War Veterans, a veterans' organization for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and China Relief Expedition. The monument was installed in Battleship Oregon Park in 1939, just south of the Hawthorne Bridge. The area is now park of Tom McCall Waterfront Park (pictured in 2012). The memorial was installed in Battleship Oregon Park in February 1939, just south of the Hawthorne Bridge by Southwest Jefferson Street (now part of Tom McCall Waterfront Park). Following the installation, E. C. Sammons, chairman of the Battleship Oregon Memorial Fund, said he wished to \\"do away\\" with the monument. In 1941, he submitted a proposal to replace the memorial with the Skidmore Fountain, but both sculptures remained in their respective locations. The construction of Harbor Drive required the artwork to be relocated temporarily. Workers were supposed to cut the monument into pieces and prepare them to cross the Willamette River for storage at the Stanton Yard facility. However, the memorial disappeared in 1942, and its exact method of removal and current whereabouts remain unknown. City officials attempted to locate the sculpture without success, and contemporary historians and art admirers have continued to search for answers. Portland did not maintain a record of public art at the time, and the memorial was not inventoried. Some local Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War veterans inquired about the monument's whereabouts. According to The Oregonian, \\"On the whole they apparently didn't think too highly of the memorial as art, but they nevertheless were a bit put out that the city had misplaced it\\". City officials considered moving Theodore Roosevelt, Rough Rider (1922)‚ÄîAlexander Phimister Proctor's equestrian statue of Roosevelt installed in the South Park Blocks‚Äîto the site previously occupied by the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial, but nothing came to fruition. In 1972, the city's property-control officer Don Eckton recalled, \\"I think I remember it cracked when they were taking it apart... It wouldn't surprise me a bit if it isn't underneath that highway\\", referring to Harbor Drive. Amy Platt, digital history manager at the Oregon Historical Society, has shared: \\"One theory is that it was demolished in place and buried in pieces in the park. Another is that some unknown person offered to haul it away and put it in a bunker somewhere.\\" Reception Some critics said the memorial's statue resembled Benito Mussolini (pictured). The memorial was reportedly an \\"instant landmark\\" upon its installation and a site not to be missed by visitors to downtown Portland. The Oregonian called the artwork \\"a man-sized controversy\\". Critics described the monument as \\"a Frankenstein's monster\\", \\"a monstrosity\\", and \\"bad art\\". Others said the statue was \\"stately\\" and resembled Benito Mussolini, the 27th Prime Minister of Italy. In 1945, following Barrett's death in 1943, Hermione Bain of The Register-Guard said the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial was one of the artist's best-known public artworks, along with Shemanski Fountain in Portland's South Park Blocks. The Oregonian published in 1983: > When in February of '39 [Barrett's] work was unveiled ... the figure proved > to be a massive, 14-foot-tall hunk of tufa, cubistically planed. What's > more, rather than the heroic president it purported to honor, it resembled > no less an anti-hero than Mussolini. The timing, with the Axis war boiling > toward our shores, couldn't have been worse. 'A monstrosity!' the public > roared. 'A Frankenstein!' The berated monster didn't hang around long. In > 1941, during the reconstruction of the marine park, it was found necessary > to move him temporarily to warehouse quarters. Though it would seem hard to > lose such a massive man-stone, it was the last the figure was ever heard of > or seen. In 2017, Douglas Perry of The Oregonian described the memorial as \\"one of Portland's lost public-art masterpieces (or grotesque curiosities, depending on one's artistic taste)\\". The newspaper's Grant Butler included the monument in his overview of \\"14 Portland treasures trashed in the name of progress\\", and wrote, \\"if you look closely, it actually bears closest resemblance to the art deco figure of Academy Award trophies\\".

This orchid only occurs in tropical North Queensland.  Description  Bryobium queenslandicum is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that forms dense clumps with crowded, cylindrical pseudobulbs long and wide. Each pseudobulb has two lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves long and wide. Between three and twelve cream-coloured or pinkish, resupinate flowers about long and wide are arranged on a flowering stem long. The flowers are cup-shaped, self-pollinating and hairy on the outside. The sepal and petals are about long and wide. The labellum is about long and wide with three lobes. The side lobes are erect and the middle lobe turns downward with two ridges near the base. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming The dingy urchin orchid was first formally described in 1948 by Trevor Edgar Hunt who gave it the name Eria queenslandica and published the description in The North Queensland Naturalist. The type specimen was collected by John Henry Wilkie who collected in on Mount Bellenden Ker. In 2002 Mark Clements and David Jones changed the name to Bryobium queenslandicum.

Early life and education  Warfield Longcope was born in Baltimore, Maryland to George and Ruth (Theobald) Longcope.Tillett, William S., \\"Warfield Theobald Longcope\\", National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C. His mother's family had a long history of achievement in medicine, starting with Nathan Smith, the third graduate of Harvard College's medical department. Longcope graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1897. In 1901 he graduated from the university's medical school, part of their fifth class of students.\\"Memorial: Warfield Theobald Longcope, M.D.\\" Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc. 1954; 65: liii‚Äìlvi. Among the significant influences in his education were William H. Welch and William Osler. As a result of these influences, he elected to concentrate on pathology in his post-doctoral education.\\"Portrait Collection: Warfield Theobald Longcope\\" The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions  Early medical career  After completing medical school, Longcope took a position as the resident pathologist at Pennsylvania Hospital's Ayer Clinical Laboratory, working under the direction of Simon Flexner. By 1904, he was the laboratory director, a position he held until 1911. Between 1909 and 1911, he was also an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. In 1911, he left to become an assistant professor at Columbia University and physician at Presbyterian Hospital; by 1914, he was the medical director.  Wartime service  Longcope served in World War I as an Army physician, his active duty service beginning in August 1917 and continuing through 1919. He was part of the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army, and later consulted for the American Expeditionary Forces.  Later career  At the end of his military service, Longcope returned to his positions at Columbia and Presbyterian. For a brief time in 1922, he was a professor at Cornell University Medical School, before returning to his alma mater later that year as director of the Johns Hopkins University medical department and physician- in-chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital.\\"Warfield T. Longcope, M.D.\\", American Association of Immunologists Longcope was one of the founding members of the American Society for Clinical Investigation,Brainard, Ellen R., \\"History of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, 1909-1959\\", J Clin Invest. 1959 Oct; 38(10 Pt 1-2): 1784‚Äì1837 and served as the organization's president in 1919. He was the president of the American Association of Immunologists from 1935-6, having already served as one of their councillors from 1934-5 (and again from 1936-1940). From 1945-6 he was president of the Association of American Physicians.  Awards and honors  During his long career, Longcope accumulated a number of awards. He was made a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1923, was awarded the Bronze Medal of American Roentgen Ray Society in 1937, became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1943, and was awarded the Kober Medal in 1948.  Research interests  From the earliest phases of his medical education, Longcope had a particular interest in bacteriology and pathological anatomy. He spent much of his career studying antigen-antibody mechanisms. During his time with the military, he studied influenza and hemolytic streptococcus, both of which were major wartime concerns. He was one of the researchers on Dimercaprol (\\"British Anti-Lewisite\\") during World War II, and also encouraged its postwar civilian use as an antidote to metal poisoning. In total, he published 125 papers, including a major one after his retirement on sarcoidosis. Longcope was noted for keeping files on his \\"favorite\\" diseases, with case notes, photographs, and other information for each; he kept these files current up through the final weeks of his life.  Family  Longcope married Janet Percy Dana in 1915. She was the daughter of Paul Dana, editor of the New York Sun. They had four children, two boys and two girls. Continuing the family tradition, one of the sons became a physician as well. Longcope retired from active practice in 1946. He died of emphysema in 1953, at his farm in Lee, Massachusetts.

Life Binnie-Clark was born in Dorset, England on April 25, 1871. As a young woman, she impetuously purchased 320 acres of land in the Qu'Appelle Valley of Saskatchewan in 1905. Because she was a woman, she was not eligible for a free quarter-section of land from the Canadian government. However, through bank loans, she was able to purchase land. A single, upper- middle class Englishwoman, Binnie-Clark represented the new generation of female farmers who were not widows or daughters of farmers, but who selected farming as a profession that would provide them with income and independence. Farming advocacy Binnie-Clark tirelessly advocated for the female right to cultivate the land. She aligned herself with a group of women \\"who were fighting out the battle of our Empire with the pick and the spade on unbroken soil.\\" She began to gain widespread attention and acknowledgement in 1908, when she published serval articles in the Canadian Gazette that encouraged others to follow her lead, and move to the West. Binnie-Clark, perturbed by the inequality of land grants and the inaccessibility of land for women (unless they were widowed), drew upon her linguistic talents in an attempt to convince the government that women could perform tasks outside of what was typically thought of as appropriately feminine. She believed in the ability of women to sew the seeds of the British Empire in the New World. Although she pursued an occupation that was considered exclusively male, she maintained her femininity in her public life. She taught agricultural skills to young women on her farm, as well as published works and spoke publicly about the benefits of planting imperial seeds through working the land. She believed in the unique position and ability of British women to \\"play a critical role in the 'spade-work of British expansion.\\" Eventually, she published two books entitled A Summer on the Canadian Prairie (1910) and Wheat and Woman (1914). The latter work summarized content from her speeches and previous publications, as well as including anecdotes from her early years of working the land. Her autobiographical works are full of details of her life in prairie Canada. She describes \\"the social life and customs, material culture, local politics, and the rhythm of daily farm life.\\" In addition, her writings described Indigenous peoples in a less discriminatory manner than other writers of her time. In several ways, Binnie-Clark was advanced for her era. She worked from both Saskatchewan and England, serving as a bridge between the Crown and its colony. With the outbreak of the First World War, she returned to England, where she managed crews of female agricultural workers in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire districts. After the war, when her brother, also a farmer in Saskatchewan died, Binnie-Clark resumed her life on the Canadian prairies. After 1921, she shared the responsibility of farming with her sister. By 1930, the two women managed 275 acres. However, in 1936, Binnie- Clark returned to England where she remained until her death. Decades later, Binnie-Clark is remembered as the fiercest advocate of the farming profession for British women at the turn of the century. She died on April 22, 1947 in England.
