Founded in 1986 by Donald Barthelme and Phillip Lopate, Gulf Coast was envisioned as an intersection between the literary and visual arts communities. As a result, Gulf Coast has partnered with the University of Houston's Creative Writing Program, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Menil Collection to showcase some of the most important literary and artistic talents in the United States. Faculty editors past and present include Mark Doty (1999‚Äì2005), Claudia Rankine, (2006) and Nick Flynn (2007‚Äìpresent). The magazine publishes poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. In 2007, Heather McHugh chose David Shumate's Drawing Jesus, which first appeared in Gulf Coast, for The Best American Poetry 2007, and Stephen King listed Peter Bognanni's The Body Eternal and Sandra Novack's Memphis, again premiering in Gulf Coast, among the 100 Distinguished Stories in The Best American Short Stories 2007. Gulf Coast featured artists Robyn O'Neil and Amy Blakemore have been featured in the Whitney Biennial. History The magazine was originally named Domestic Crude (1983-1985), a name that nodded to the major industry of the Houston area. It was a 64-page (magazine-formatted) student-run publication, with editorial advising coming from Lopate, who also contributed work to the first issues. In 1986, the name Gulf Coast: A Journal of Literature and Fine Arts was adopted. After some experimenting, the magazine found its dimensions and, eventually, its audience. The print magazine comes out each April and October. Gulf Coast is still student-run. The magazine seeks to promote and publish quality literature in our local and national communities while simultaneously teaching excellence in literary publishing to graduate and undergraduate students. Being committed to providing a variety of literary approaches and voices, all of the editorial positions are two-year terms, thus ensuring a regular turnover in the specific personality and style of the magazine. In addition to literature, Gulf Coast explores the visual arts. Each issue features two artists, along with short essays on the work from the art editor. Gulf Coast Prize Each year, the magazine presents the Gulf Coast Prizes in Poetry, Fiction, and Nonfiction. Outside judges name the winners, who each receive a $1,500 honorarium and are published in the magazine's Winter/Spring issue; two runners-up in each genre will each receive a $250 second prize. Past judges for the prizes include Eula Biss, Eavan Boland, Terrance Hayes, Susan Howe, Antonya Nelson, and Natasha Trethewey. Barthelme Prize Gulf Coast also awards the annual Donald Barthelme Prize for Short Prose which awards $1,000 and publication to one prose poem, micro- essay, or short story of five hundred words or less. The Barthelme Prize was inaugurated by editors emeriti Sean Bishop and Laurie Cedilnik in 2008. Past judges for the Barthelme Prize include Beckian Fritz Goldberg and Mary Robison.

The district encompasses a large area in the central southern part of the town, where much of its early development took place. Its westernmost public point is the corner of Mason and Macveagh Roads, and it extends eastward from there, encompassing properties that abut Mason, Venable, and New Harrisville Roads south to the town line with Dublin. Further east it encompasses properties on Bonds Corner Road between Eastview and Lampman Roads, as well as some property on the north side of Lampman Road. The district includes existing houses and outbuildings as well as foundational and archaeological remnants of previous early settlement structures. A portion of the district along New Harrisville and Venable Roads is overlaid by the Beech Hill Summer Home District. Harrisville was laid out as part of Dublin in 1750, with an initial survey laying out 220 lots. All or part of sixteen of the first lots to be settled are included in the district, and represent the largest concentration of arable land in the town. Early property divisions are still largely marked by roads (either actively used or abandoned), stone walls, and mature tree plantings. This area began as a subsistence farming area, but developed in the 19th century as a supply center for the growing mill village in the center of Harrisville. The farms in this district supplied perishable farm products for the village residents and mill workers, sheep wool for the mills to process, and lumber for construction and the manufacture of wood products. These uses declined in the early 20th century, with the economic decline partially offset by the rise of summer country estates in the area.

Biography and career Eddy Huntington was born in the northeast of England and moved to London at the age of 18, where he became a music video extra and model. He was discovered by Baby Records, an Italian record label who took him to Milan to record the song \\"USSR\\" written by R. Turatti, M. Chieregato and T. Hooker. When \\"USSR\\" was released throughout Europe in 1986 on ZYX Records it became a big hit in mainland Europe and in the Soviet Union and is widely popular to this day. Huntington went on to have other lesser known hits such as \\"May Day\\" and \\"Meet My Friend\\". He also released the album Bang Bang Baby in 1989. Huntington left the music industry in the early 1990s and trained to become a primary school teacher in the UK. He taught at Eldon Grove Primary School in Hartlepool teaching children in year 1. He provided after-school drama and singing lessons as well as everyday lessons. He then moved to Thailand for two years with his wife teaching at Bangkok Patana School.

Established in 1906, it is the third oldest society still in existence at the University, after the BMSA and Christian Union. The first meeting of the society was held on 30 January 1906, with William Mac Arthur being elected the first president.History of An Cumann Gaelach The society is part funded by the University, through the Students' Union. History =Early years= The Irish Language Society, An Cumann Gaelach, was founded on 30 January 1906 and was the first language society at the University. Prior to its establishment, there had been several athletic clubs, along with the Literary and Scientific Society, Belfast Medical Students' Association and the Christian Union, making the Society the third oldest still active in the University, and even predates the University itself, which was not founded until 1908 (previously it had been one of three Queen's Colleges established in 1848, the other two being in Galway and Cork, now part of the National University of Ireland). The establishment of An Cumann Gaelach was part of a movement that had been taking place across Ireland and the Irish communities abroad from the second half of the nineteenth century, which aimed to celebrate traditional Gaelic culture and sport. This period saw the establishment of Conradh na Gaeilge (known as the Gaelic League in English), a body for the promotion of the Irish language, in 1893 and the Gaelic Athletic Association (Irish: Cumann L√∫thchleas Gae]), which promoted traditional sports such as gaelic football and hurling, in 1884. Like most of these groups at the time, An Cumann Gaelach was founded by Protestants, indeed only 25 Catholics attended the University out of a total student population in the region of 400.http://quis.qub.ac.uk/gaelach/history.php Although the Society had only been set up in 1906, the founding members had been giving Irish lessons for several years previous. =Sir William Porter MacArthur (1884‚Äì1964)= William MacArthur, was the first President of the Society, having learned Irish in Cloch Cheannfhaolaidh in west Donegal. MacArthur, like many Queen's students at the time, studied medicine and was later to go on to serve in the British army, earning the title of Lieutenant General during his career. While serving in the army he was stationed for a time at the Queen Alexandria Military Hospital. While in London he published a 'landmark' paper called 'Cysticercosis [a parasitic disease] as seen in the British army, with special reference to the production of epilepsy‚Äô'Taenia Solium Cysticercosis: From Basic to Clinical Science' by Gagandeep Singh and Sudesh Prabhakar in 1934. MacArtur served in several positions throughout his career before retiring in 1941 with the title of \\"Lt-Gen. William MacArthur, DSO, OBE, CB, KCB, MB, DPH, MD,DTM&H;, DSc, MRCPI, FRCPI, FRCP.\\" In addition to his military career, he was also an author writing on topics such as the Great Famine and wrote medical entries for Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives =1920s and '30s= In 1920 the island of Ireland was partitioned with the six north-eastern counties becoming Northern Ireland, with Belfast as its capital. Although a majority of the population of the new state supported it, a significant minority were opposed to it, leading to clashes on the streets during the 1920s. This led to a polarisation in society at the time, with the Irish language becoming politically associated with Catholic Nationalists who rejected British rule in Ireland. The growing tensions greatly affected the Irish language movement throughout Northern Ireland and people's opinions of the language became tainted with sectarianism. This had a knock-on effect to An Cumann Gaelach and the University's Protestant community were not as involved in the Society has they had been previously. Between 1925 and 1929 the Society had more or less died out until an Irish language revival movement in the University around 1930. In 1936 the Comhchaidreamh (interrelationship in English) was formed, an organisation that sought to create links among all University Irish societies. Queen's University's Irish Language Society had close ties with their counterparts around Ireland until the 1970s, with regular debates and plays organised by students, however, in recent years these strong links have weakened significantly. =1950s and '60s= The Society grew between 1950 and 1970 due to an increase in the student population and a cultural revival of the Irish language throughout Ulster at this time, particularly in Belfast, Lurgan, Portadown, Armagh City and Downpatrick. This increased interest reflected to some extent the rising influence of Comhaltas Uladh, the Ulster Council of Conradh na Gaeilge (The Gaelic League). The Society's magazine, An Sc√°th√°n (The Mirror), was formed in 1950 and was published three or four times a year. To mark the golden anniversary of the establishment of the Society, a publication was made, entitled Fearsaid (the root of the word Feirste, the river after which Belfast was named). During this period, the Society strengthened its relationship with the Donegal Gaeltacht, which exists to this day. In the 1960s and 1970s, the members of An Cumann Gaelach often travelled to Ballinamore in County Donegal, providing the members with an opportunity to see Irish in use in everyday life. While in Donegal, they also helped the community by doing voluntary work, including in the construction of the local community centre. =The Troubles= The 1970s saw an increase in membership, with more than 300 members for most years in that period; high relative to 21st century membership levels. The 1970s also saw the Cumann organise monthly c√©il√≠s in what is now the Mandela Hall in the Students' Union, as well as continuing the classes and trips to the Gaeltacht. The popularity of the language was reflected with most University signs been in both Irish and English during this period. As the Troubles dragged on, the membership of the Society began to dwindle year on year and many events were either abandoned, such as the regular c√©il√≠s, or downscaled, like the trips to Donegal. Present day The Good Friday Agreement brought peace to the streets of Northern Ireland for the first time in thirty years and led to a gradual reduction in sectarianism. The suspicions that had previously surrounded the Irish language also began to fade, seen through the growth of Irish medium schools over the past decade. An annual survey of Cumainn across Ireland by Irish language daily, L√° Nua has shown growth in the society's number since the start of the decade, rising from 25 in 2003 to 168 in 2007, making it the largest in Northern Ireland and the fifth largest on the island.L√° Nua, '\\"Gl√∫in TG4\\" ag teacht in aib√≠ocht ar champais olscoile na h√âireann', 10 December 2007 2006 marked the centenary of An Cumann Gaelach with a C√©il√≠ M√≥r in Belfast's Wellington Park Hotel, and the publication of a second edition of Fearsaid, edited by then president, Sorcha Nic Lochlainn. The society continues to run weekly Irish classes and trips to the Gaeltacht, as well as other cultural events such as traditional music sessions, talks and film showings. In 2018, the Cumann Gaelach launched a campaign for bilingual signage at QUB. In 2020, the Cumann Gaelach ran a week long Irish festival, F√©ile Mhic Art√∫ir, at the university.

It is situated west of Plymouth and one mile east of Seaton.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 Plymouth & Launceston Downderry has a long beach of light shingle. There is road access down to the beach via a slipway although this is blocked by a locked gate, pedestrian access is still possible. Dogs are allowed on the beach. The east beach has a reputation as a nudist beach. The village and beach offer views of Looe Island to the west and Rame Head to the east and on clear days sight of the Eddystone Lighthouse to the south. The village has a Church of England church, a Methodist chapel, a shop with a post office, a pub, a restaurant, a coffee shop and a primary school. The Church of St Nicolas Downderry began as a mission church to service the growing population of the village. The building dates from the late 19th century. Points of interest =Bass rock= Approximately east of the village center is a rocky outcrop known locally as \\"Bass Rock\\", this is a popular fishing spot as it affords access to deeper water. =Coleadon= further on from Bass Rock are the cliffs of Coleadon, the promontory past these cliffs means access to the beach past this point is cut off at high tide. =The Long Stone (Shag rock)= thumb Past Coleadon is a stretch of beach which ends in a rocky outcrop known locally as \\"Shag rock\\" after the seabirds of the same name who can be seen sitting on the rock drying their wings after diving for fish. This marks the end of easy foot access to the coastline. There is a path up the cliff which leads to the road above this beach, the climb is pleasant but reasonably strenuous. The ruins of an old Victorian lodge, known as \\"St Germans hut\\", can be found half way up this cliff path. =Television transmitter= On one of the hills above the village is a television transmitter which serves as a repeater for the local area. =Chain Home bunkers= During the Second World War Downderry was the site of a Chain Home radar installation. The remains of this installation are present and can be found on the East side of the village. One of the bunkers has been converted into a residential garage, the other is no longer accessible from the road as it is now private property. =Neolithic earthworks= The only known example of a 'cursus' earthwork in Cornwall is situated behind the village in the fields near Triffle farm. =Wreck of the Gipsy= The Gypsy (Rodney) wrecked off of Downderry, Cornwall. The wreck of the Gipsy can be found just off of Downderry in about of water west of the slipway. Originally named 'The Rodney' she was an iron full-rigged ship built in 1874 by W. Pile & Co., Sunderland. In Nov. 1895, Rodney lost her figurehead in a gale in the English Channel, while en route from Gravesend, Kent to Sydney. The figurehead washed ashore at Whitsand Bay, Cornwall, six months later. In 1897, the ship was sold to F. Boissi√®re, of Nantes, France, and renamed Gipsy (the cross-over year, per Lloyd's, is 1896/97). Re-rigged then as a Barque. On Dec. 7, 1901, the vessel was wrecked, a total loss, at Downderry on the return voyage from Iquique (Chile) to France with a cargo of nitrate. The ship lost her bearings and became stranded on the reef. She was blown apart by explosives as she had become a hazard to local fishing vessels.

The Barony of Glengarnock is one of three feudal baronies which together form the parish of Kilbirnie in the district of Cunningham which lies in north Ayrshire.

The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries, 5v, Edinburgh. p 294. The castle is an example of a keep with courtyard attached and dates from the period 1400 - 1542, with various later buildings in the courtyard. It is described in the New Statistical Account of Scotland (1845) as follows: \\"The ruins of Glengarnock Castle stand on a precipitous ridge or knoll, overhanging the Garnock, about two miles (3 km) north of Kilbirnie. This brawling stream skirts two sides of the knoll; and as the ravine through which it flows is fully eighty feet in depth, the position, under the ancient system of warfare, must have combined security with the means of easy defence. The only access to the castle is from the northeast, in which direction the ridge, upon which it is situated, is connected with the adjoining field. At the distance of thirty yards from its entrance, a depression in the ground indicates what has been the course of a dry moat, by which, and a drawbridge, the approach is said to have been protected.\\" Note: also quoted in Paterson, James. (1852) History of the County of Ayr. Vol. II p. 113. In 1956 this dry moat was still 30 metres in length and had an average depth of 4 metres with a width of 8 metres. Evidence in 1964 was recorded of a small building lying in between the dry moat and the castle, possibly a farmstead. The New Statistical Account continues: \\"The ground-plan of this ancient stronghold could, until lately, be easily traced; and as a portion of the exterior walls still remains nearly the original height, its appearance when entire may, with little difficulty, be yet shadowed out. From notes and measurements taken a few years ago, it may be described in general terms, as having consisted of a quadrilateral tower, with a court of less elevated buildings extending from its east side. The entrance has been from the eastern extremity of the latter. This facade is long, and has been about in height. A court or passage, in length, lay between the entrance and the tower, on each side of which has been a range of two-storied apartments. The tower is long, wide, and its height has been above .\\" The far wall of the old keep showing the plaque commemorating the consolidation of the ruins in 1841. \\"Its upper and now only accessible story has consisted of a hall occupying the whole extent within the walls, and the imbowed ceiling of which has been in height. It has been lighted both from the court and from the exterior walls. One of the windows overlooks the rugged chasm through which murmurs the Garnock, and from two narrow apertures facing the east, the eye may yet revel over a beautiful extent of the district bearing the same name as the old lords of the castle. From the hall, a narrow circular stair led to the upper part of the building, which has been surrounded by a parapet wall. The ruins show neither the arrow-slit nor gun-port of defence, so common in similar old houses. Perhaps the situation was of itself so secure as to render unnecessary the ordinary means of repelling an attack. The uniformity of style in all castellated mansions, erected prior to the discovery of gunpowder, renders it hazardous to be precise regarding the date of their construction. Few, however, conversant with such remnants of feudal architecture, would hesitate to assign to the ruins of this stronghold, an antiquity as remote as that of any remains of masonry in the west of Scotland.\\" John Smith records in the 1890s that a substantial midden had built up below the castle over the years and this was largely formed from ashes from the typical local low quality coal, together with broken fragments of tiles and patterned glass with chipped and roughened edges.Smith, John (1895).

Le Royaume Armenien de Cilicie, p. 66 The letter was also shown to Louis IX. Sempad the Constable () (1208‚Äì1276) (also Smpad and Smbat) was a noble in Cilician Armenia, an older brother of King Hetoum I. He was an important figure in Cilicia, acting as a diplomat, judge, and military officer, holding the title of Constable or Sparapet, supreme commander of the Armenian armed forces. He was also a writer and translator, especially known for providing translations of various legal codes, and the creation of an important account of Cilician history, the Chronique du Royaume de Petite Armenie (Chronicle of the Kingdom of Little Armenia). He organized and fought in multiple battles, such as the Battle of Mari, and was trusted by his brother King Hetoum to be a key negotiator with the Mongol Empire. Biography At the time of Sempad's birth there were two key dynasties in Cilicia, the Rubenids and the Hetoumids, and he was related to both. Sempad was the son of Constantine of Baberon and Partzapert (third cousin of Leo II of Armenia). Other siblings included John the Bishop of Sis, Ochine of Korykos, Stephanie (later wife of King Henry I of Cyprus), and Hetoum, who became co-ruler in 1226. The earlier ruler had been Queen Isabella of Armenia, who was married to Philip, son of Bohemond IV of Antioch. Constantine arranged for Philip to be murdered in 1225, and forced Isabella to then marry his son Hetoum on June 4, 1226, making him the co-ruler, and then sole ruler after Isabella's death in 1252. Historical context Cilicia was a Christian country, that had ties to Europe and the Crusader States, and fought against the Muslims for control of the Levant. The Mongols were also a threat, as Genghis Khan's Empire had been steadily pushing westward in its seemingly unstoppable advance. The Mongols had a deserved reputation for ruthlessness, giving new territories one opportunity to surrender, and if there was resistance, the Mongols moved in and slaughtered the local population. In 1243, Sempad was part of the embassy to Caesarea, where he negotiated with the Mongol leader Baiju. In 1246 and again in 1259, Sempad was in charge of organizing the defense of Cilicia against the invasion of the Sultanate of Rum. In 1247, when King Hetoum I decided that his wisest course of action was to peacefully submit to the Mongols, Sempad was sent to the Mongol court in Karakorum.Edwards, p.9 There, Sempad met Kublai Khan's brother M√∂ngke Khan, and made an alliance between Cilicia and the Mongols, against their common enemy the Muslims.Bournotian, p. 100. \\"Smbat met Kubali's brother, Mongke Khan and in 1247, made an alliance against the Muslims.\\" The nature of this relationship is described differently by various historians, some of whom refer to it as an alliance, while others describe it as a submission to Mongol overlordship, making Armenia a vassal state.Weatherford, p. 181 Historian Angus Donal Stewart, in Logic of Conquest, described it as, \\"The Armenian king saw alliance with the Mongols - or, more accurately, swift and peaceful subjection to them - as the best course of action.\\"Stewart, Logic of Conquest, p. 8. \\"The Armenian king saw alliance with the Mongols - or, more accurately, swift and peaceful subjection to them -- as the best course of action.\\" Armenian military leaders were required to serve in the Mongol army, and many of them perished in Mongol battles.Bournotian, p. 109 During his 1247-1250Stewart, p. 35 visit to the Mongol court, Sempad received a relative of the Great Khan as a bride. He had a son with her, named Vasil Tatar,Luisetto, p.122, who references introduction and notes in G√©rard D√©d√©yan La Chronique attribu√©e au Conn√©table Sempad, 1980 who would later be captured by the Mamluks at the Battle of Mari in 1266.Stewart, p. 49 Sempad returned to Cilicia in 1250, though he returned to Mongolia in 1254, accompanying King Hetoum on his own visit to the court of the Great Khan, M√∂ngke. On the death of his father, Sempad became Baron of Pape≈ï≈çn (√áandƒ±r Castle) and resided in its small, but lavish baronial palace.Edwards, p.102-110; pls.53a-56b, 292b-295a Sempad died in 1276 either in the Second Battle of Sarvandikar, fighting against the Mamluks of Egypt, or against an invasion of the Turcomans from Marash. The Armenians won the battle, but Sempad and several other barons were lost.Mutafian, p. 61Stewart, p. 51 Judge Sempad was a member of the Armenian supreme court, the Verin or Mec Darpas, which examined government policies and the legal codes. He created a translation of the Assizes of Antioch (a legal code) from French, and also created in Middle Armenian a Datastanagirk' (codex), which was based on and adapted from the earlier work of Mkhitar Gosh.Dictionary of the Middle Ages Writer Sempad is best known for providing eyewitness written accounts of his era. He wrote the \\"Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arm√©nie\\" (History of the Kingdom of Little Armenia) which begins around 951/952, and ends in 1274, two years before his death. He worked from older Armenian, Syriac, Christian, and possibly Byzantine sources, as well as from his own observations. Sempad's writings are considered a valuable resource by historians, although some have criticized them as unreliable, as Sempad was often writing for reasons of propaganda rather than history.Little, An Introduction to Mamluk HistoriographyAngus Donal Stewart, Armenian Kingdom Multiple translations exist of the work, in varying levels of completeness. According to historian Angus Donal Stewart, there are both French and English translations, which cover the period up until the 1270s.Stewart, p. 22 In the 19th century, it was translated by Eduard Dulaurier and published in Receuil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Armeniens I, together with some other continuation excerpts by an anonymous author which cover the period after Sempad's death, up through the 1330s. This edition also includes excerpts from the work of Nerses Balients, who was writing in the later fourteenth century.Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Arm√©niens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arm√©nie, p. 610 et seq. Sempad was enthusiastic about his travel to the Mongol realm, which lasted between 1247 and 1250.Grousset, p.529, Note 273 He sent letters to Western rulers of Cyprus and the Principality of Antioch, describing a Central Asian realm of oasis with many Christians, generally of the Nestorian rite. Richard.

Based primarily on a sword used by the French Army, the model 1840 NCO proved somewhat heavy hilted and ill balanced. For over 70 years, it was widely used by the Army; today its usage is restricted to ceremonial occasions.A HISTORY OF THE NCO U.S. ARMY MUSEUM OF THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER Written by L.R. ARMS Edited by Melissa Cooper, March 2007, U.S. ARMY SERGEANTS MAJOR ACADEMY The sword had a 31-inch blade (some being slightly longer), a cast brass hilt resembling the more expensive wire-wrapped leather grips, and a leather scabbard rather than the steel used by cavalry troopers and officers. Although some makers, such as Emerson and Silver issued a steel scabbard rather than leather to protect from wear. Leather scabbards were phased out beginning in 1868. Union soldier armed with NCO sword, Bowie knife and revolver History The sword replaced a weapon more commonly known as the Model 1832 foot artillery sword which was used by both the infantry and the artillery regiments from 1832 to 1840.http://arms2armor.com/Swords/1840nco.htm Its wearing was granted to all sergeant ranks until it came out of use in 1875. Additionally first sergeants and above would wear a waist sash from 1821 to 1872. Army Digest: The Official Magazine Of The Department Of The Army, Vol. 22, No. 12, December 1967, p. 48Emerson, William K. Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman - London, 1996, p. 14-15The sword was worn either on a white or black baldric or with an Enfield bayonet frog. A shorter version with a 26-inch blade was carried by musicians, this was called the Model 1840 musicians' sword. The M1840 has had a long service life, seeing frontline service from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War to the American Civil War until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During the Civil War it wasn't always issued to volunteer regiments. The primary contractor for the production of the M1840 NCO sword seems to have been the Ames Manufacturing Company. During the Civil War multiple companies were contracted by the U.S. government to manufacture edged weapons alongside Ames. Two of these companies, Emerson and Silver and Christopher Roby, manufactured M1840 NCO swords. The weapon was made with a blunt edge as swords at the time were sharpened only when they were expected to be used in action. The narrow blade was a compromise between cut and thrust actions, yet the thick spine favors stabbing over than slashing techniques. It was the main weapon of standard bearers (along with the Colt Army Model 1860 and Colt 1851 navy revolver) and hospital stewards, as well as a secondary weapon for infantry NCOs. The sword was also used by the Confederates who captured many after seizing state arsenals. In 1868 the ordnance board recommended that no more leather sword, or bayonet scabbards be purchased, so after the leather ones were used up, a black Japanned steel scabbard was substituted, along with a new pattern leather frog. It remained in service as a ceremonial weapon until general orders No. 77 dated August 6, 1875 discontinued its use. A modern version of this sword with steel scabbard is currently permitted for wear by US Army platoon sergeants and first sergeants; in practice it is rarely seen outside the 3rd Infantry Regiment (the \\"Old Guard\\") and honor guards. Some army NCOs have this sword and wear it for social occasions, regardless of duty as a platoon sergeant or first sergeant.

The home of the Dundas family since the Middle Ages, it was sold in the late 19th century and is currently the residence of politician and businessman Sir Jack Stewart-Clark. The tower house and the adjoining Tudor-Gothic mansion are listed separately as Category A buildings, and the grounds are included in Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. History The name Dundas comes from the Gaelic d√πn deas, meaning 'south hill' or 'pretty hill'. In the 11th century, the lands of Dundas, along with other land in Lothian, were granted by King Malcolm Canmore to Gospatrick, the earl of Northumbria, who had come north to escape William the Conqueror. The lands of Dundas passed to his great-grandson Waldeve, who granted them to his kinsman Helias in a charter dating from around 1180. Helias took his surname from his lands, becoming the first of the Dundas family. The Dundases and their cadets would later come to own much of Mid and West Lothian. In 1416, James Dundas obtained a licence from the Duke of Albany (then the effective ruler of Scotland) to build a keep.HMC 3rd Report: James Dundas (London, 1872), p. 413. This keep was extended in 1436, making it into an L-plan. The Keep served both as a home in times of peace and a fortress in times of war. On 13 August 1553 in the great hall, James Dundas gave his infant daughters Elizabeth and Jane gifts of silver plate.HMC 4th Report: A. Wauchope (London, 1874), p. 537. Oliver Cromwell is known to have stayed at Dundas Castle around the time of the Battle of Dunbar in 1650. A statue of him remains standing outside the Keep. In 1818, James Dundas had the 17th century portion of the building pulled down and rebuilt in a Tudor-Gothic style by the renowned architect William Burn. Burn also designed many churches and this influence is visible throughout the building. Burn's designs for the main state rooms allow for huge windows that look out on to lawns and parkland outside. The building and extensive gardens had cost so much to construct that the Dundases were forced to sell the castle and lands in 1875. The buyer was William Russell. It was again sold in 1899, when it was bought along with five farms and of agricultural land by Stewart Clark, the owner of a Renfrewshire textile company and a respected philanthropist. Clark's son, John, took the double-barrelled surname 'Stewart- Clark' in honour of his father, and he was made a Baronet in 1918. During the Second World War, Dundas Castle served as the headquarters for protecting the Forth Bridge. Since 1995, the castle's owner has been Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, the great-grandson of Stewart Clark. Stewart-Clark was a Member of the European Parliament between 1979 and 1999. Facilities Dundas Loch in the Winter By the time Sir Jack inherited the property from his mother in 1995, it had deteriorated substantially. He initially considered selling it, but instead chose to embark on a programme of restoration. The Keep, uninhabited for over 300 years, had its parapet rebuilt and its stonework restored, and it was installed with electricity, heating, toilets and a kitchen. The dry rot in the castle itself was removed, and the drawing room, library and dining room were redecorated. The castle is now a 5 star exclusive venue, often used for weddings. In the grounds of the castle is a holiday cottage called the Boathouse, situated on the shore of Dundas Loch. It is a 4 star self-catering venue. Dundas Castle is a member of Unique Venues of Edinburgh and Luxury Edinburgh =Film and TV location= Dundas Castle has been used as a backdrop in films The Little Vampire (2000), Summer Solstice (2005), and Book of Blood (2009).

HSFH blends the sound of 3rd wave ska with indie rock, drawing comparisons to acts such as Less Than Jake, Taking Back Sunday, RX Bandits and Sublime. The band released two records with Asbestos Records. In late 2006 the band disbanded as members opted to pursue other interests. In 2014 the band reunited and began releasing music in a yearly demo format. The most recent HSFH releases are always available for free download through the band's digital platforms. They are also available for streaming via all major outlets. Members of High School Football Heroes have performed with Against Me!, Catch 22, The King Blues, Straylight Run, The Fad and Edna's Goldfish. Dave Solomon and Jason Rutcofsky were early members of Bomb the Music Industry!.  Original Run  HSFH began releasing yearly demos in 2001. During this time, the band also released a split EP with fellow Long Island ska band Premarital Sax, under Justin Conrad's Crappy Jack Records label. By 2003, enough EPs and demos had been distributed, and enough of a response had been garnered to warrant a full-length release. \\"Close Only Counts in Horseshoes and Hand Grenades\\" is the first (and only) full-length release from HSFH, consisting of 14 songs. The album was the first of two HSFH albums to be released by Asbestos Records (CT). Recorded at Sabella Studios of Roslyn Heights, NY, the 28 minute full length is a frantic, energy-filled production that provides a close representation of the band's live performances at the time. After three years of consistent touring, the band released a self- recorded six-song EP entitled \\"We've Fooled Around Long Enough\\". The album was recorded at Hofstra University, using Jason Rutcofsky's studio time as a student there. High School Football Heroes self-recorded and self-produced the album, with Dave Solomon and Chris Askin recording the guitar tracks in the absence of a permanent member at the time. Receiving extremely positive reviews and fueled by a long stint on the Van's Warped Tour, 3,500 copies of \\"We've Fooled Around Long Enough\\" were sold in the two months following its release.  Breakup  In 2006, coming off of the Van's Warped Tour, the band decided to disband, citing various reasons. Between 2006‚Äì2014, members of HSFH joined or started other acts on Long Island including Barnaby Jones, Family Lumber, Trust in Numbers, Rice Cultivation Society, ROBBERS, and The Nix86. In 2011, Dave Solomon, Joe Masterson, Jason Rutcofsky, Chris Askin and Travis Herdt (a past HSFH guitarist) formed Liars, Etc. With similar writing to HSFH, Liars Etc. carries a similar feel to HSFH, but without a horn section. Liars Etc. has not released any recorded music to date. Go Big! was formed and is fronted by Jason Rutcofsky. In addition to lead vocals, Rutcofsky performs on guitar, piano, synthesizer and saxophone. Joe Masterson and Dave Solomon of HSFH are also permanent members of Go Big!. The band is active and performs regularly in the Long Island/NYC area.  Return  In late 2013, Dave Solomon and George Argyrou began writing songs together, with intentions of performing as a two-piece acoustic act. Within a matter of months, HSFH reunited, adding Jeff Bourlier of Too Short Notice (NJ) on guitar as a permanent member.

INU was first founded as a private college known as the Incheon Technical College in January 1979. Later, it was renamed Incheon College in December 1979 before getting promoted to a comprehensive university in 1988. In 1994, the university was renamed once again to University of Incheon, which was a city council funded university. In addition to these changes, INU also relocated from Dohwa-dong in Nam-gu to a new location in 2009. Now, INU stands in the new and young international city of Songdo which is also known as the New Songdo City, located in IFEZ (Incheon Free Economic Zone). A year later, in 2010, INU merged with Incheon City College to expand capacity and open more curricula. The university now operates two campuses at Songdo, main campus, and also at Dohwa-dong, satellite campus. From January 2013, the university was rechartered as one of Flagship Korean National Universities (ÏßÄÎ∞©Í±∞Ï†êÍµ≠Î¶ΩÎåÄÌïôÍµê, Âú∞ÊñπÊìöÈªûÂúãÁ´ãÂ§ßÂ≠∏Ê†°) in South Korea, representing Gyeonggi Province and Incheon city.

In February 2009, Incheon Institute for Korean Language Studies was opened. Also In 2009 Jul, construction of Sondgo campus (Main Campus) was completed. In 2010, the university merged with Incheon City College. As a result, many new departments were opened with larger student capacities. In February 2013, the university was nationalized. Also, the university was renamed Incheon National University. Relocation and new campus Previous Campus in Dohwa New Songdo Campus UI relocated from Dohwa-dong in Namgu to new location in 2009.

In 1853 he received his doctorate from the University of Munich, and furthered his studies in Berlin under Albrecht von Graefe (1828-1870); in Prague with Carl Ferdinand von Arlt (1812-1887) and in Vienna with Eduard J√§ger von Jaxtthal (1818-1884). In 1854 he returned to Munich, where he became director of the surgical policlinic (Reisingerianum). In 1863 he was appointed \\"full professor\\", at the University of Munich, where he practiced ophthalmology until his retirement in 1900. He was the son of noted surgeon Franz Christoph von Rothmund (1801-1891). In 1868 Rothmund was the first physician to describe a rare hereditary oculocutaneous disease that consisted of telangiectasia, erythema, congenital cataracts and bone defects, along with other symptoms. This disorder was to become known as the Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome; named in conjunction with British physician Matthew Sydney Thomson FRSE (1894-1969).

It was originally broadcast in six episodes on BBC Radio in 1993. In the UK, it is repeated from time to time on the digital channel BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC7), available globally via the BBC Sounds website. Plot Eloise (Louise Lombard) works at the Co-op supermarket in a town in the North of England. She feels different from the people around her, dresses in black, and is unhappy much of the time, as if some piece of her life is missing. Then her mysterious Transylvanian Aunt Lucretia (Joanna Kanska) reveals that she is really a vampire, a hereditary condition, and she must enter training to fulfill her destiny. Eloise eventually embraces her fate, but has to deal with her boyfriend Wayne, played by William Ivory, and her equally mystified co- workers at the store, including flatmate and best friend Debbie (Jane Hazlegrove). She is horrified to find herself back in \\"school\\", with Lucretia as the teacher, even to the extent of sitting for three hour examination papers. Having been a miserable failure at exams in school despite her intelligence, she is convinced she will fail yet again. However, the exams have a \\"practical section\\" which saves her grade. Later she wants to tell Wayne and others about herself, but Lucretia convinces her to test them first by telling each a different, fictitious but shocking \\"secret\\" about herself, making them promise not to tell anyone else, to see if they can in fact keep her confidence. So Wayne learns that she was once jailed for stealing, Debbie is told that she is pregnant, and she tells her boss Mr. Jenkins that she is secretly in love with him. With some nudging from Lucretia, hilarious consequences ensue.

He became a high school coaching legend in the state of Arkansas after winning 10 state championships and producing a 33-win streak in 11 years at Little Rock Central High School. He later became an assistant to Frank Broyles at the University of Arkansas. Born and raised in rural Atkins, Arkansas, Matthews attended local Atkins High School, where he played varsity football under coach Raymond Burnett and was a two-time All-State selection. Matthews went on to play at Arkansas Tech University, where he was an All-Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference (AIC) honoree in 1940 and 1941. He continued his playing career at the University of Arkansas for one year under George Cole. In 1943, Matthews was drafted for military service and assigned to the Monticello A&M; V-12 Program, where he played with the Monticello Marine-Navy team. He earned his bachelor's degree and his master's in education from Arkansas. Matthews also served his country in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. In 1944 Matthews became head coach at Rogers High School in Rogers, Arkansas. After a single season, finished with a 7‚Äì3 record, Matthews left Rogers for the Little Rock High School, where he became an assistant to his former high school coach Raymond Burnett. As Burnett moved on to coach Arkansas Tech University, Matthews was named head coach, taking over one of the premier high school football programs in the nations. The Little Rock Central Tigers had won the mythical national championship in 1946. Matthew's first Tiger teams went 12‚Äì0‚Äì1 in 1947 and 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 in 1948. His next two teams finished 10‚Äì1 and 10‚Äì2. In 1951, his team was 9‚Äì3 but a one-point loss to North Little Rock that season was the last defeat a Matthews-coached Central team had against competition from Arkansas. The Tigers were undefeated in the state the next six years. Matthews led the Tigers to unbeaten seasons in 1956 and 1957, and left the school with a 33-game winning streak. His 1957 team won the schools second mythical national championship. Matthews joined the University of Arkansas Razorbacks in January 1958, coaching the defensive ends and linebackers at Arkansas before taking administrative duties in 1969.

With mobile phones being reliable only to around five miles (8 km) off the coast, crew on board merchant ships have until comparatively recently had few means of communicating with their families at home. History Before the introduction of satellite communications enabled by the Inmarsat A terminal in the early 1980s, crew members relied on their ship's radio personnel to send either a telex or patch-through a radio-to-telephone message once their ship was at sea. When time in port between voyages could extend to several weeks this social isolation was usually manageable, but by 2001 average vessel turnaround times in port had declined to an overall mean of less than a day, while voyages could last several weeks. At a time when many shipowners complained that they could not find competent personnel, the lack of normal communications avenues such as SMS and mobile voice services was thought to be a possible contributory factor.

It is slower and more rhythmic form. The word \\"Jhumar\\" comes from Jhum/Jhoom, which means Swaying. The songs evoke a quality which reminds of swaying. Though the content of these songs is varied - they are usually love with emotional songs too. The Jhumar is a dance of ecstasy. Jhumar is performed at the wedding ceremonies usually. It is a living demonstration of the happiness. The dance is mostly performed by the Balochi and people of Southern and central Punjab. The emphasis of Jhumar is recreating the gaits of animals and birds. The movement of animals, the ploughing of the field, sowing of seeds and harvesting are shown in the original progression. The dance is also performed in circle, to the tune of emotional songs. Dancing style Performed exclusively by men, it is a common feature to see three generations - father, son and grandson - dancing all together at weddings. The dance is without acrobatics. Each region of Southern Punjab has its own variation of Jhomar. The movement of the arms only is considered its main forte. Feet are musically placed in front and backwards and turnings are taken to the right, sometimes the dancers place their one hand below the ribs on the left and gesticulate with the right hand. This dance does not tire out its performers and it is normally danced on moonlight nights in the villages away from the habitation. The dancers of this dance let-off a sound, \\"Dee Dee\\" in tune with the beat of the dance which adds to its grace. This dance has also been integrated into Bhangra in the eastern parts of Punjab. Types There are three main types of Jhoomar, each of which has a different mood and is therefore suited to different occasionally, reason of its predominating mood. They are: * Satluj Jhoomar * Beas Jhoomar * Chenab Jhoomar * Multani Jhoomar * Jhoomar Taari Dancers After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, many dancers moved away and the dance is started disappearing, but Pokhar Singh (1916-2002) learned Jhoomar from his uncle and performed it since. Dancing was in his blood. Before his death he taught the dance to the students at D.A.V. College, Jalalabad, Eastern Punjab.

The beginning is laid during 1934 with incandescent lamps for general lighting service. Later on during 1957 begins the production of fluorescent lamps; during 1962 - of automobile lamps; during 1973 - of halogen lamps; during 1977 - of mercuri lamps with high pressure. Quartz glass with high purity is produced from 1977.  \\"Svetlina\\" AD, Stara Zagora  Founded in 1949 in the city of Stara Zagora, this plant produces vehicle lamps, ship projectors and many more. It also produces a variety of street lams, the most popular models of which are 36.9.900.094, 36.2.900.101 and 36.2.900.103. An interesting fact is that these lamp models survived for two decades before being replaced with newer, but (as reported by independent specialists in the field of lighting) inferior street lamps, produced by Hit Lighting - Bulgaria. Svetlina's lanterns are bigger and heavier than the Hit Lighting ones. However, they also have bigger refractors, thus spreading light more efficiently. In addition they have an original design, whether the lanterns of Hit Lighting look very similar to the current lanterns of other manufacturers, e.g. General Electric and Technosvet. Svetlina luminaries stayed almost the same in the outside (because their design is considered both standard and aesthetic, while in the same time not being obsolete), but constantly changed in the inside. They were also exported to many countries, particularly to USSR, Russia and Germany. Highly neglected from 2001 to 2006, these lanterns are currently regaining their popularity from the past.

It is a common, worldwide pest of grain and grain products as well as fruit, chocolate, drugs, and tobacco. The biology of O. mercator is nearly identical with Oryzaephilus surinamensis (the sawtooth grain beetle). It can be differentiated from O. surinamensis by its larger eyes and by the shape of the head, the area just behind the eyes of O. mercator is narrower than that of O. surinamensis, which has a more triangular shaped head. Unlike O. surinamensis, adults are capable of flight. Life cycle The female may produce up to 285 eggs which are laid within a food source. The larva are yellowish-white with a brown head and can reach a length of up to 3mm, larva are active and move about through a food source as they feed. Larva molt two to four times before pupating in a cocoon-like structure made by joining together small grain kernels and pieces of kernels. The total life cycle takes approximately 27‚Äì50 days. As a stored grain pest O. mercator is one of the most commonly encounter pests in grain and grain products, and will feed on any foodstuffs of vegetable origin. Broken grain kernels are the principal food source but whole kernels may be penetrated and fed on. This feeding results in the destruction of grain (shrinkage). Further, the metabolism of a population of insects results in an increase of water absorption into the grain, which can cause mold growth. Control In commercial grain storage operations bins should be cleaned after emptying in order to prevent any insects from infesting new grain. Fumigation can be used to eliminate infestations, and grain stored more than 6 months may need an application of pesticide to prevent infestation. The fumigants used for control of insects in grain do not leave a residue when used properly but are highly toxic and require a qualified pesticide applicator. In the home, products susceptible to infection should be kept in sealed containers to exclude these beetles. Freezing infested foodstuffs at -18 ¬∞C for six days will kill all stages of the O. mercator life cycle. Infestations always center around a food source used for breeding and the identification and removal of all infested foodstuffs will eliminate the population  References  Category:Silvanidae Category:Beetles described in 1889 Category:Agricultural pest insects ","title":"Oryzaephilus mercator"},{"id":"13681473","title":"Watershed (k.d. lang album)"},{"id":"13681487","text":"The Ciocadia is a right tributary of the river Gilort in Romania.

The Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry is a pedestrian and cycle ferry service across the River Thames. The service has operated almost continuously for over 500 years. Connected communities and landmarks The ferry connects points remaining outside London in the post-1965 definition of Surrey, England. The ferry runs from Ferry Lane, in Shepperton, to a point a short tarmac-paved and tree-lined walk from Thames Street, in Weybridge. It is a few metres below Shepperton Lock on the north bank and an increased number of islands on the south bank through the construction of the approximately full- flow-sized flood relief channel which cut through Hamhaugh Island in the mid-20th century. The southern islands can include two along the River Wey which has a canal paths from this point leading to Woking and Basingstoke or to Guildford, which are national trails. The ferry provides a crossing for the Thames Path, and is the only ferry on route of the path itself. Three public houses are within 300 metres of the ferry, two on the south bank and two of which focus on their restaurants, one of which is a listed building and was the home of the Dutch Ambassador.Good Pub Guide Accessed 2015-04-07 Operation The ferry operates from 0800 on weekdays, 0900 on Saturdays, and 1000 on Sundays. Service finishes at 1700 in winter and 1800 in summer. Operation is on request and intending passengers should ring the bell provided on each side of the river. When the ferry is not in service, the nearest alternative is to cross the river downstream at Walton Bridge, a round-trip distance of some on foot, further by car. The ferry has operated on different vessels for over 500 years discounting a 26-year-break before 1986. Exceptional expense and a very low housing density in the immediate area prohibited a proposed replacement by a long, unsupported by piers, footbridge.

This is provided in the form of an Assessment Roll, which is delivered to municipalities throughout the province on the second Tuesday in December. Municipalities then take the assessment roll, and calculate property taxes for each individual property in their jurisdiction. MPAC complains that taxpayers often confuse MPAC's role as an assessment agency for taxes; MPAC responds that it only provides assessments. Municipalities set the tax rates and distribute the tax burden based on the assessed values provided by MPAC. The head office is located in Pickering, Ontario. MPAC, formerly known as OPAC (Ontario Property Assessment Corporation), was created on December 31, 1997, as a method to create accurate and equitable assessments across Ontario. MPAC came into existence with the MPAC Act, and it administers the Assessment Act, both part of Ontario provincial legislation. On December 31, 1998, the Government of Ontario transferred responsibility for property assessment from the Ministry of Finance to the Ontario Property Assessment Corporation, an independent body established by the Ontario Property Assessment Corporation Act, 1997. According to MPAC: \\"Every municipality in Ontario is a member of MPAC, a non-share capital, not-for-profit corporation whose main responsibility is to provide its customers - property owners, tenants, municipalities, and government and business stakeholders - with consistent and accurate property assessments. MPAC is accountable to the public through a 15-member Board of Directors. Eight members of the Board are municipal representatives; five members represent property taxpayers; and two members represent provincial interests. The Minister of Finance appoints all members of the Board. '' MPAC administers a uniform, province-wide property assessment system based on current value assessment in accordance with the provisions of the Assessment Act. It provides municipalities with a range of services, including the preparation of annual assessment rolls used by municipalities to calculate property taxes. Municipal enumerations are also conducted by MPAC in order to prepare a Preliminary List of Electors for each municipality and school board during an election year. Today, MPAC is responsible for the assessment of nearly 4.7 million properties in the province.\\" Prior to the creation of MPAC, municipalities in Ontario had discretion on how they chose to assess properties. This created inequity across the province, as similar properties across the province had separate values. In 2008, MPAC sent out approximately 4.7 million property assessment notices, advising properties of their assessment value. The current values are based on a January 1, 2008, valuation date.  MPAC history  =Pre-1970= Although property assessment originally came under the jurisdiction of Upper Canada, it was transferred to Ontario municipalities in 1849. Over time, each municipality developed its own assessment system and methods of valuing property. This resulted in inconsistencies in property assessment and the distribution of property taxes. Within a municipality, properties with a similar appearance and value could have very different assessments. There were also very different assessments from municipality to municipality. In 1963, the Provincial Government appointed the Ontario Committee on Taxation to study taxation and recommend changes. Its report, published in 1967, highlighted many inequities in the assessment system. =1970-1997 ‚Äì Market value assessment introduced= In response to The Ontario Committee on Taxation Report, the Provincial Government assumed responsibility for property assessment in 1970 to create a uniform assessment system for all Ontario municipalities. The Government introduced market value assessment and the new system was offered to municipal governments on a voluntary basis. Since the new system was voluntary, not all municipalities implemented market value assessment. As a result, property assessments differed from municipality to municipality. This situation was addressed by the Province with the introduction of the Fair Municipal Finance Act, 1997. With this Act substantial amendments to the Assessment Act, the Municipal Act and other related legislation were implemented, setting the stage for reshaping Ontario‚Äôs assessment and property tax system in 1998. =Post-1997 ‚Äì Ontario Fair Assessment System= Under the \\"Ontario Fair Assessment System\\", property assessments across the province were updated to their current value, using a common valuation date. In addition, on December 31, 1998, responsibility for property assessment was transferred by the government of the Hon. Mr. Mike Harris to a new, not-for-profit corporation called the Ontario Property Assessment Corporation, later renamed the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC). Every municipality in Ontario is a member of MPAC, which is governed by a Board of Directors composed of taxpayer, municipal, and provincial representatives. =Controversy= Persons living in areas where other houses increase in value, such as by replacement with newer and larger houses, often blame MPAC for increases in their taxes. MPAC disclaims responsibility, arguing that the property owners should blame the municipality.Reference Needed The municipalities, in turn, blame MPAC and its organizing legislation. The debate is ongoing.

His legend states that he was the first bishop of √âvreux. He evangelized the region and died a martyr. Legend His largely legendary life is known through a manuscript of the 10th century, itself based on a ninth-century text. The legendary life was written by a monk named Deodatus, who added details according to the standard passiones of the time, mixing factual information with wonderful stories. The garbling of dates and traditions thus ensures that it is impossible to date the time of Taurinus' episcopacy, although scholars usually place it at the beginning of the fourth or in the middle of the fifth century. Taurinus was born in Rome to Tarquinius, a heathen, and Eustycia (Eusticie, Euticia), a devout Christian. An angel appeared to Eustycia to announce that her son would have a great destiny. His godfather was Pope Clement I, who entrusted Taurinus to Denis the Areopagite (misidentified with Denis, first bishop of Paris), who in turn was considered one of the first disciples of Saint Paul. According to Louis Duchesne this legend arose about the ninth century, when Abbot Hilduin of Saint-Denis was intent on proving the identity of Dionysius the Areopagite with Dionysius (Denis), first Bishop of Paris.Goyau, Georges. \\"Evreux.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 17 April 2020 Thus, the legend assured that there was an \\"apostolic succession\\" from Paul directly to the episcopate of √âvreux. Taurinus became bishop of Evreux around 385. His legend states that Taurinus faced a demon at √âvreux that took three shapes: that of a lion, a bear and a buffalo. These metamorphoses either represented various deadly sins, or represented the official Roman religion (lion), the worship of Diana (bear), and the local agrarian-based religions (the buffalo). According to Orderic Vitalis in his Historia Ecclesiastica, Taurinus expelled the demon from the local temple of Diana, and when it obeyed his order to break its own idols it was not immediately cast into the Pit, but was instead punished by remaining in the place where it had ruled while seeing the people it had tormented saved. He reported that it was known by the local people as Gobelinus, and still haunted √âvreux, appearing in various shapes, but hurt no-one. Taurinus then converted the local pagan temple into a church, dedicating it to the Virgin Mary. Two priests of the goddess, Cambise and Zara, had attempted to stop Taurinus from entering the temple, but they were immobilized after the bishop made the sign of the cross. They then asked to be converted to Christianity. Relief depicting Taurinus converting people to Christianity. A number of miracles were associated with Taurinus. His legend states that he raised a girl, Euphrasia, from the dead after she died in a fire. After he had done so, there was no trace of burn marks on her. Taurinus‚Äô miracle led to 120 converts. Taurinus also brought back to life Marinus, the son of the local prefect, who had fallen into a hole and died from the impact. After a short prayer, Taurinus revived the young man. At once, Marinus requested baptism for himself and his entourage, and 1200 other people. After Taurinus' death, Maximus of Evreux was sent by Pope Damasus I to continue his predecessor's work. Veneration Modern statue of Taurinus. A monastery dedicated to Taurinus was built around the sixth century; it was restored in the tenth century at the instigation of Richard I of Normandy. Bishop Landulphus is credited with having discovered, in answer to fervent prayer, the relics of Taurinus.; he built a basilica in the saint's honour. Taurinus' relics were translated to various places. In 892, Bishop Sebarius (S√©bar) transferred some of his relics to Lezoux (Puy-de-D√¥me). Some of this Lezoux group of relics was later carried to the Abbey of Cluny. In the ninth century, at the time of the invasion of the Normans, the remaining group was transferred to Gigny (Jura),Monks of Ramsgate. \\"Taurinus\\". Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 10 August 2016 and their presence there is attested as of the 12th century. Other relics were deposited in the church of P√©zy before being transferred in 1024 to Chartres Cathedral. In 1035, the abbey of Saint-Taurin was placed under the jurisdiction of the Abbey of F√©camp, which also claimed the body of Taurinus. The monks of Saint-Taurin claimed that they owned a part of the saint‚Äôs relics. In 1247, Gislebert de Saint-Martin, abbot of Saint-Taurin, had a reliquary (see gallery) built to house the remaining relics. Raurinus is the patron saint of the Diocese of Evreux.

It is the type genus for the group known as zosterophylls, thought to be part of the lineage from which modern lycophytes evolved. More than 20 species have been described. Description Zosterophyllum fossils from North Rhine-Westphalia; left: showing curled (circinnate) branch tip; right: with sporangium The diagnostic features of the genus have changed since its first description in 1892, as the original species (Zosterophyllum myretonianum) has become better known, and as other species have been discovered. Zosterophyllum is a vascular plant. The axes (stems) are naked, lacking leaves or outgrowths (\\"enations\\"). When branching occurs, the branches are either isotomous (equally sized) or pseudomonopodial (one branch is larger than the other but still clearly involves division of the original axis rather a distinct side growth). The sporangia are upright on short stalks. In face view, they are flattened, usually kidney-shaped (reniform). They open (dehisce) along the top forming two equally sized valves. Sporangia are grouped into a compact spike in which they are either helically arranged or form distinct rows (e.g. Z. llanoveranum). Z. myretonianum is thought to have been semiaquatic. Taxonomy The genus Zosterophyllum was erected in 1892 by David P. Penhallow for the type species Zosterophyllum myretonianum, based on fossils found at Myreton quarry near Dundee, Scotland, in Lower Devonian rocks (from about ). Species with radially symmetrical spikes of sporangia have been placed in subgenus Zosterophyllum, those with bilaterally symmetrical spikes in subgenus Platyzosterophyllum. Hao and Xue in 2013 used the absence of terminal sporangia to place some species, such as Z. llanoveranum, in the paraphyletic order Gosslingiales, a group of zosterophylls considered to have indeterminate growth, with fertile branches generally showing circinate vernation (initially curled up). Other species, such as Z. myretonianum, were not placed in the order, as they did not have terminal sporangia. =Phylogeny= A cladogram published in 2004 by Crane et al. places the species of Zosterophyllum in a paraphyletic stem group of broadly defined \\"zosterophylls\\", basal to the lycopsids (living and extinct clubmosses and relatives). On this view, the genus is not monophyletic. A cladistic analysis by Hao and Xue in 2013 agreed that Zosterophyllum is not monophyletic, with the three species of Zosterophyllum they included falling into different clades, some being closer to the Gosslingiales than others. Their analysis differed in producing a monophyletic clade of zosterophylls (their Zosterophyllopsida). =Species= Species that have been described include: * ‚Ä†Z. australianum Lang & Cookson (1931) * ‚Ä†Z. bifurcatum Li & Cai ‚Äì fragmentary * ‚Ä†Z. deciduum Gerrienne * ‚Ä†Z. divaricatum * ‚Ä†Z. dushanense * ‚Ä†Z. fertile Leclercq (1942) * ‚Ä†Z. llanoveranum Croft & Lang (1942) * ‚Ä†Z. longhuashanense ‚Äì fragmentary * ‚Ä†Z. longum (H√∏eg) H√∏eg (1967) * ‚Ä†Z. minifertillum Hao & Xue (2013) * ‚Ä†Z. minor Ananiev (1960) * ‚Ä†Z. minorstachyum * ‚Ä†Z. minutum * ‚Ä†Z. myretonianum Penh. * ‚Ä†Z. ovatum Edwards & Li (2018) * ‚Ä†Z. qujingense * ‚Ä†Z. ramosum Hao & Wang (2000) * ‚Ä†Z. rhenanum Kr√§usel & Weyland (1935) * ‚Ä†Z. shengfengense * ‚Ä†Z. sichuanense ‚Äì correct genus? * ‚Ä†Z. sinense * ‚Ä†Z. spathulatum ‚Äì fragmentary * ‚Ä†Z. spectabile * ‚Ä†Z. tenerum Hao & Xue (2013) * ‚Ä†Z. xishanense * ‚Ä†Z. yunnanicum Hs√º (1966) Some species have been transferred to other genera: * Z. artesianum to Danziella artesiana * Z. contiguum to Demersatheca contigua * Z. subverticillatum to Adoketophyton subverticillatum  References  Bibliography * External links * Cladogram from Category:Silurian plants Category:Devonian plants Category:Silurian first appearances Category:Devonian extinctions Category:Paleozoic life of New Brunswick Category:Paleozoic life of Nunavut Category:Zosterophylls Category:Lycophyte genera Category:Prehistoric plant genera ","title":"Zosterophyllum"},{"id":"13681669","text":"Miss Venezuela 1967 was the 14th edition of Miss Venezuela pageant held at Teatro de la Academia Militar in Caracas, Venezuela, on June 15, 1967, after weeks of events.

It is today served well by its extensive rail network centering on East and West Croydon stations, from where London Overground, First Capital Connect and Southern operate to most parts of Central and Greater London, as well as Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and the East of England. With the A23, M23 and M25 orbital motorway intersecting Croydon to the South East, it is the principal gateway of the motorway network from the East Sussex area of the South Coast. London Gatwick Airport is located to the direct south of the town and has scheduled flights to destinations within Europe, North America and Asia, although has tough competition from the even bigger London Heathrow Airport to the west but has managed to stay the UK's second busiest airport.UK airports owned and operated by BAA The town has since 2000 had a tram network which has been highly successful, carrying more than 24 million passengers a year. The network has four lines with destinations including New Addington to Wimbledon, Beckenham to West Croydon, Elmers End to Therapia Lane, and Elmers End to West Croydon. Croydon is one of only five London boroughs not to have any form of London Underground services. These good transport links have been a major factor contributing to the growth of Croydon, and have led to the town becoming a major centre for distribution. Retail is another major service and employer in the town centre, with a retail economy which has experienced a boom resulting in several new shops. North End is Croydon's main shopping street, with the Whitgift and Allders situated on it. The town centre also includes the famous Surrey Street market, one of the only lasting town centre markets in the Croydon and South London areas, and over 3 indoor shopping centres. The Whitgift Centre and the newest Centrale centre. Park Place will re-establish Croydon as one of the UK's top shopping areas. Plans include the construction of a new shopping centre to replace St George's Walk and older properties on George Street. The proposed redevelopment of Park Place by Minerva and Lend Lease will create a one million square foot destination with over 130 shops, cafes and restaurants, anchored by a new department store which the council hopes will be John Lewis. Other tenants interested have included Habitat, Borders and Gap. Improvements will see Queen's Gardens completely remodelled, together with the construction of a fully integrated public transport hub to include a new bus interchange and tram stop. The building of Park Place will create Europe‚Äôs largest covered retail area. HMRC regional centre, Ruskin Square Croydon is one of the largest financial centres in the south east outside London and is also home to many legal and insurance firms. Croydon is a major office area in the south east of England, being the largest outside of Central London. In 2007, Croydon leapt up the annual business growth league table, with a 14% rise in new firms trading in the borough after 125 new companies started up, increasing the number from 900 to 1,025, enabling the town, which has also won the Enterprising Britain Award and \\"the most enterprising borough in London\\" award, to jump from 31 to 14 in the table.

Born in Eugene, Oregon, he is best known for his work with Beck, Nine Inch Nails, M83 and Air. Meldal-Johnsen served as the touring bassist for Nine Inch Nails between 2008 and 2009, and was Beck's longtime bassist and musical director, on-and-off, from 1996 until 2016. He has recorded with many other artists including Garbage, The Mars Volta, Frank Ocean, Dixie Chicks, Tori Amos, Dido, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Goldfrapp, Blood Orange, Pete Yorn, Turin Brakes, Marianne Faithfull, Ladytron, and more. As a producer, Meldal-Johnsen has worked with M83, Paramore, Metric, Tegan and Sara, Jimmy Eat World, The Naked and Famous, School of Seven Bells, Neon Trees, Young the Giant, Ken Andrews, Division Day, and more. Musician career and history Meldal-Johnsen grew up in Los Angeles, obsessively listening to his parents' records and received his first bass guitar at the age of fourteen. Like most budding musicians, he spent his time playing along to his favorite bands' records and jamming in garages. His interests were wide, but centered on American post-punk (H√ºsker D√º, Fugazi, The Minutemen, Sonic Youth) and UK post-punk, goth, and dream pop (Wire, Cocteau Twins, Gang of Four, Love and Rockets, Bauhaus, New Order, Joy Division). After high school at the age of seventeen, he worked the night shift as a janitor at Cherokee Recording Studios in Hollywood, looking in on late-night sessions, and occasionally invited to witness the proceedings. In 1987 he met Beck, and the two would form a lasting friendship and shared musical interests that would eventually culminate in Justin joining Beck's touring band many years later. From 1988 to 1993, Meldal-Johnsen was in LA alternative rock bands Last Carousel and This Great Religion, with Tony Hoffer. In 1994, he joined the band Pet, which featured singer Lisa Papineau and guitarist Tyler Bates. Also in 1994, Meldal-Johnsen joined Los Angeles alt-noise band Medicine with Brad Laner, and recorded and toured with them until their eventual break-up in 1996. Laner and Meldal-Johnsen would continue to record and work together on projects such as Electric Company as well as Laner's various solo albums in years to come. In early 1996, Beck asked Meldal-Johnsen to join his touring and recording band, which he was a member of from 1996 until leaving in May 2016, an announcement which was made during Beck's set at the Beale Street Music Festival during band introductions in an emotional yet thankful manner. He recorded with Beck on albums such as Odelay, Mutations, Midnite Vultures, Sea Change, Guero, and The Information, as well as hitherto unreleased material. He had toured with Beck during all years since 1996 with the exception of 2005 and 2008. In 1998, he joined up with French band Air for their Moon Safari tour, followed by the recording of their 2001 album 10 000 Hz Legend. In 2002, he helped to form the band Ima Robot, and On September 6, 2003, Ima Robot released their first full-length album, the self-titled Ima Robot. The album featured the singles \\"Dynomite\\" and \\"Song #1\\" (released in the UK only), and the band supported their album by touring worldwide with artists such as Hot Hot Heat, The Von Bondies, Jane's Addiction, The Sounds, and others. In 2006, he briefly joined Gnarls Barkley, acting as the musical director and assembling the touring band. He was involved in just two performances before re-joining with Beck: The Coachella Festival and a secret show at The Roxy in Hollywood. In 2008, Meldal-Johnsen met with Trent Reznor and was invited to join the Nine Inch Nails touring band as bassist, guitarist, and keyboard player. Meldal-Johnsen spent the majority of 2008 to 2009 in Nine Inch Nails on their Lights in the Sky (2008), and NINJA / Wave Goodbye (2009) tours. In 2010, Beck asked Meldal-Johnsen back into the studio to contribute to a large body of work to be divided amongst multiple eventual releases, a process that continues to this day. During 2010, he resumed performing live with Beck. Producing career Beginning in about 2005, Meldal-Johnsen thought that he may be able to parlay his extensive studio experience as a musician into the field of producing and engineering, something he had always had interest in. His first forays were exclusively co- productions, but beginning in 2009, he began to move forward as a full-fledged producer/co-writer/collaborator. This is seen most clearly with his production and writing on the acclaimed 2011 M83 album, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming. Today, Meldal-Johnsen spends most of his time producing records, working largely from his studio in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California. In 2013, he produced Paramore's self-titled fourth album, and Young the Giant's album Mind Over Matter. As of Fall 2014, Meldal-Johnsen has worked with The Naked and Famous, School of Seven Bells, and The Raveonettes in between touring with Beck. He later produced Wolf Alice ‚Äòs sophomore album, Visions of a Life which won the Mercury Prize on 2018.

He is noted as a first four-star air officer who commanded the Pakistan Air Force as its Chief of Air Staff from 15 April 1974 to 22 July 1978. Upon retirement, he served on a diplomatic assignment, and headed the diplomatic mission in the United States as a Pakistan Ambassador from 1989 until 1990. Biography Zulfikar Ali Khan was born in Lahore, Punjab, British India, on 10 December 1930. His family was of Pathan descent and attended a local school in Lahore where he did his matriculation. From 1947, he attended the Military College Jhelum but joined the Pakistan Air Force in 1948 when he made a transfer to the Pakistan Air Force Academy in Risalpur, NWFP in Pakistan. He gained commissioned in the Air Force as a P/Off. and passed out from the PAF Academy in 1950 in the class of 7th GD pilot course (GD(P) Course) on 21 December 1950. IN 1956, Flt-Lt. Khan first command assignment was to No. 20 Squadron Eagles. In the 1960s, Squadron-Leader Khan was educated at the Air War College where he gained a degree in staff course. In 1965, Sq-Ldr. Zulfikar Ali Khan participated in the second war with India in 1965 where he commanded No. 9 Squadron Griffins against the Indian Air Force. From 1966‚Äì68, Wg-Cdr. Zulfiqar Ali Khan was posted in the Foreign ministry and briefly tenured as air attach√© at the High Commission of Pakistan in New Delhi led by H.E. Arshad Hussain. In 1968‚Äì71, he was promoted as Group- Captain in the Air Force and was posted in East Pakistan where he was appointed as officer commanding of operations wing of Dacca Air Base under its Air Officer Commanding Air Cdre. Inamul Haq. Air Cdre. Khan participated in liberation war that took place in East Pakistan, serving against the Indian Air Force. Gp-Capt. Khan was taken war prisoner by the Indian Army after the Eastern Command was surrendered by its GOC-in-C Lieutenant-General A.A.K. Niazi. In 1973, he was repatriation to Pakistan and was allowed to continue his military service and was promoted to a one-star rank, Air-Commodore, and took over the Air Force Academy as its Commandant in 1973, but later posted as commandant of the Air War College for a short brief of time. His command assignment included the command as an Officer commanding of No. 11 Squadron Arrows, No. 9 Sq. Griffins, and AOC of the Sargodha Air Force Base. Chief of Air Staff In 1974, Air-Cdre. Zulfiqar Ali Khan was promoted as Air Vice Marshal in the Air Force, and was appointed as Deputy Chief of Air Staff of Aerial Planning (DCAS(P)) at the Air AHQ in Islamabad but was later posted as Director-General of Air Operations (DGAO). On 14 April 1974, AVM Zulfiqar Ali Khan was surprisingly appointed second Chief of Air Staff to take over the command of the Air Force as an Air-Marshal. The appointment was controversial since Air-Marshal Zafar Chaudhry was dismissed from his service, and Air-Mshl. Khan had succeeded seven senior air officers in the Air Force. In 1975, he helped established the Northern Air Command based in PAF Base Kalabagh, oversaw the induction of MiG-15 as jet trainer, establishment of the Air Defence Command, and provided his support to rebuilt Mirage III aircraft at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. On 1 January 1976, Air-Mshl. Khan was elevated and promoted to four-star rank, Air Chief Marshal, becoming the first four-star rank officer in the Pakistan Air Force. ACM Zulfiqar Ali Khan was then made senior member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and honored with the NI(M) for meritorious services. During this same time, ACM Zulfikar Ali Khan helped establish the Combat Commanders School set up under Gp-Capt. Cecil Chaudhry. Over the issue of clandestine atomic bomb programme, ACM Zulfiqar Ali Khan reportedly advised Prime Minister Bhutto against the acquisition of the aging A-7 and F-5 military aircraft in order to stop the work on the Reprocessing plant for plutonium development, noting that \\"atomic bomb programme should not stop for any reason be compromised.\\" On 5 July 1978, ACM Zulfikar Ali Khan was appointed Deputy CMLA alongside with naval chief Admiral Moh'd Sharif, army chief General Zia-ul-Haq, and Chairman joint chiefs General Muh'd Shariff after the military coup d'√©tat against the civilian government led by Prime Minister Bhutto. On 22 July 1978, ACM Zulfiqar Ali Khan tendered his resignation from the command of the air force over the disagreement with the military take over of the civilian government, and handed over the command to newly appointed Air Chief Marshal Anwar Shamim. Foreign service Upon retirement, Zulfikar Ali Khan joined the Foreign Service and was appointed Pakistan Ambassador to Switzerland which he tenured from 1979 until 1981. In 1989, he was appointed as chief investigator to lead investigations on possible military funding to political parties by the intelligence community. In 1989, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto appointed him as the Pakistan Ambassador to the United States and took over the charge shortly in Washington DC. However, his tenureship was marked with controversy involving the continuation of atomic deterrence which he failed to cover-up in the United States. In 1990, he was removed from his post and returned to Pakistan after serving as ambassador for only a year. Death On 8 March 2005, Air Chief Marshal Zulfiqar Ali Khan died of cardiac arrest in Islamabad when he suffered a heart attack at his residence and was taken to the PAF Hospital, but the doctors pronounced him dead. He was given a state funeral with full honours. Begum Sajida Zulifqar, wife of Air Chief Marshal Zulifqar Ali Khan, died on 30 September 2012 and her funeral prayers were attended by all former PAF Air Chiefs, politicians, bureaucrats, senior serving and retired military officials and a large number of people from all walks of life.

Consumption of indoxacarb can cause acute onset of methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is a condition which ultimately decreases the effectiveness of red blood cells to exchange oxygen with organs. Methemoglobinemia can be fatal if left untreated, but proper treatment of this condition can rapidly begin reversing it. References Further reading  Moncada, Adriana.

Her article \\"Die Emanzipation - ein Irrtum?\\" (Emancipation - a fallacy?) describes her opinions on why birth rates continuously drop in Germany: Herman believes the Feminist movement forces women out of their natural place in the traditional family. Her understanding of female emancipation is that it calls for women to become like men. She refers to working as a 'masculine' attribute, and warns that although women can pursue talents outside the home in moderation, working outside of the home for too long puts women at risk of becoming 'masculine beings', and thus less interested in starting families. In 2007, during an event intended to promote her second book Das Prinzip Arche Noah. Warum wir die Familie retten m√ºssen., Herman criticized the German student movement of 1968. She alleged that the movement specifically devalued traditionally female gender roles and spoke favorably about the image of motherhood, family values and community solidarity in Nazi Germany.Axel Klingenberg: Das wird man ja wohl noch sagen d√ºrfen!

The original 8K78 booster had been the product of a rushed development program and its launch record was no better than the 8K72 Luna booster of 1958-60. As 1962 ended, there had been 12 launches of 8K78s, 10 of which failed (five Blok L failures, four Blok I failures, and one failure caused by the Blok A core stage). The two successful launches had had their probes (Venera 1 and Mars 1) fail en route to their respective planetary targets. As such, work began at the Korolev Bureau to improve the basic 8K78 vehicle. The core and strap-ons engines were enhanced still further and the Kosberg Bureau completely redesigned the Blok I stage. The Blok L engine was also slightly enhanced. The first six 8K78Ms built used RD-108 engines in the Blok I stage, which was also used in the two crewed Voskhod boosters, all subsequent 8K78Ms using RD-110 engines which were shared with the Soyuz booster. The 8K78M was first launched in 1964; however, the existing stock of 8K78s had not been used up yet and they continued to fly until 1967. During 1967, the improved core stage and strap-ons from the Soyuz 11A57 were adopted and made standard on all R-7 based vehicles. It made 297 launches and experienced 21 failures. There were no failures of 8K78Ms caused by the core and strap-ons, and after 1968, all failures were caused by the Blok L stage until 2005 when one of the last boosters flown suffered a Blok I engine failure.Russian Space Web - Soyuz The final flight of a Molniya-M lofted an Oko early warning satellite from Plesetsk on 30 September 2010 despite some apprehension that the launch vehicle, manufactured in 2005, had exceeded its storage life. It will be replaced by the Soyuz-2/Fregat. Although originally developed for planetary probes, those had switched to the larger Proton booster by the 1970s due to increasing mass and complexity. For most of its operational life, the Molniya-M was used to launch its namesake Molniya and also Oko satellites into Molniya orbits, orbits of high eccentricity that allow satellites to dwell over polar regions. Variants There were four main variants of the Molniya-M, which varied in terms of their upper stage. Originally, the Block L stage was used; however, uprated versions replaced this with more powerful, or specialized, stages, for different missions. The Molniya-M/2BL, used to launch Oko missile defense spacecraft, had a Block 2BL upper stage, The Molniya-M/ML had a Block ML upper stage, and the Molniya-M/SO-L had a Block SO-L stage. Retirement The Molniya-M/ML was scheduled to be the last variant to fly, with two launches of Molniya spacecraft scheduled to occur in 2008; however, they were cancelled in light of the launch failure in 2005, in favour of the Meridian spacecraft. The Molniya-M was believed to have been retired on 23 October 2007 after launching an Oko spacecraft; however, this later proved to have been incorrect, when a Molniya-M was used to launch another Oko satellite on 2 December 2008. Following a launch on 30 September 2010, the Russian Space Forces confirmed that it had been retired from service.

Vipulanada was an early pioneer associated with the Indian-based Ramakrishna Mission in Sri Lanka. Along with other reformers, Vipulanada was instrumental in the revival of the Hindu religion and native traditions in Sri Lanka after a long period of dormancy and decline during the previous 500 years of colonial rule by various European powers.  Biography  Vipulanada was born in the village of Karativu, in the south of Batticaloa in Sri Lanka. His father's name was Samiththamby and mother's name was Kannamma. His birth name was Mylvaganam. Vipulanada had his early education in St. Michael's College National School in Batticaloa city. After completing his high school education at the age of 16, Vipulanada became a teacher in various cities across the island nation. During his tenure as a teacher he completed his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of London, and also became the first Sri Lankan Tamil Pandithar, a degree awarded by the Tamil Nadu-based Madurai Tamil Sangam, a linguistics academy created to promote the study of Tamil language. Vipulanada eventually became the head of operations of the Ramakrishna Mission in Sri Lanka as well as a professor of Tamil language in two universities.  Literary contributions  Swami Vipulanandar during Tri-Tamil conference in Madurai on 1 Aug 1942 Apart from Vipulanada's knowledge of Tamil he also knew English, Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and Sinhala. After researching Tamil music and other Indian musical forms and musical instruments for many years, Vipulanada produced the seminal book of scientific research in Tamil called the Yazh Nool, or Book of Stringed Musical Instruments, which was published just before he died in 1947. The book was an effort by the author to understand and explain the intricacies and technicalities of genre of Tamil music in general, and the stringed musical instruments in particular, using modern techniques and tools of research and calculations based on mathematics and physics. Yal Nool is recognized as a unique work of its kind. Using the literary traditions in Sanskrit, Greek and English he wrote Mathangaculamani, a translation of twelve of Shakespeare's plays, as a treatise on drama with commentaries focusing on various aspects of drama such as the plot, structure, sequence of action, characterization, subjective experience and gestures. Professor Chelva Kanaganayagam, in a critical review of Mathangaculamani, concludes that Vipulanada also served as editor of several publications including Ramakrishna Vijayam (Tamil), Vivekananda (Tamil) and Prabuddha Bharata (English). He also edited and helped publish literary works of several well-known scholars. His translations from English to Tamil include selected writings of Swami Vivekananda, Bengali Nobel Laureate Rabindra Nath Tagore and historian Kathiresan Chettiar. He also translated from Tamil to English selected poems from the Sangam literature period, devotional songs from the Bhakti movement period, and poems of Subramanya Bharathi and Navaneetha Krishna Bharathi. Vipulanada authored six major Tamil publications: a collection of four Prabanthangal, Mathangaculamani, The Great Dance of Thillai, Umamageswaram (all related to Saiva traditions of the Hindu religion), Dictionary of Technical Terms on Chemistry and Yal Nool. A collection of 170 essays, written from 1914 to 1947, were published posthumously in four parts in 1995. He also wrote many poems, and a collection of 32 of his poems was published in 1995. He was a good public speaker and most of his speeches, focusing mainly on history of the Tamils, Tamil literature, Tamil music and musical instruments, and Vedanta philosophy, were published in international journals and magazines.  Ramakrishna Mission  Founded in 1897 by Swami Vivekananda, the disciple of Ramakrishna, the Ramakrishna Mission is a unique order of ascetics and volunteers dedicated to service to community, irrespective of religious, caste, creed or language differences. The mission, while promoting spiritual development, does not believe in religious conversion. The mission's charitable and philanthropic activities focus mainly on the provision of educational and medical services to the weaker segment of the population through schools, hospitals and orphanages run by the mission. It became a counter weight to Christian missionary-run charitable organizations throughout South Asia. Vipulananda initially met the head of the Mylapore Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Sarvananda,Swami Sarvananda RKM Bio (English) in Colombo in 1916. This was followed up with another visit in Jaffna in 1917. He entered the Mylapore Ramakrishna Math in 1922 for his monastic training. On completion of the training in 1924, he was given the name Vipulananda. After his ordination he dedicated his life to educational and spiritual pursuits and service to the community in Sri Lanka and India. In 1925 Vipulanada became an administrator of Ramakrishna Mission (RKM) schools in Sri Lanka. He was instrumental in founding new RKM schools in Jaffna, Batticalao, Trincomalee and in many villages. He also founded orphanages ‚Äì two for boys at Vaitheeswara Vidyalayam, Jaffna and Sivananda Vidyalayam in Batticaloa, and one for girls in Karativu. Thereafter, a number of RKM schools were opened in several remote villages in the North and East of Sri Lanka. This provided an alternative to the natives to go to schools and orphanages that were not associated with western Christian missionaries. He also helped his lifelong friend A. M. A. Azeez, a pioneering Sri Lankan Muslim educator and civil servant, to establish charitable organizations to help poor Muslims in the east of the country.  Professional career  Swami Vipulananda's burial place and memorial As a noted educationist, scholar and community worker, Vipulanada was invited by the University of Madras to present its case for the establishment of a Tamil University to the special commission set up to investigate the proposal. On the recommendation of the commission, the Annamalai University was opened in 1927. In 1931 he became its first Professor of Tamil language. Professor Vipulananda also received a second invitation to become the first Professor of Tamil soon after the University of Ceylon was established in 1943, which he held until his death in 1947. Thus Professor Vipulananda enjoys the unique distinction of being the first scholar to be appointed the first professor of Tamil in two Universities in two different countries. Vipulanada was a strong advocate of the mother tongue as the medium of education, but stressed the importance of learning other languages. At Sivananda Vidyalayam, in addition to Tamil, Vipulanada facilitated the teaching of English, Sinhala and Latin. He also recognized and promoted the importance of learning sciences such as biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics, as well as job-related technical subjects. He facilitated the efforts of other Tamil scholars to translate science and technology publications into Tamil by providing suitable technical terms. Based on his critical studies of some of Professor Vipulananda's writings, Mr. K.S. Sivakumaran, one of the notable literary critics from Sri Lanka, has called him a pioneer of Tamil literary criticism and the first Sri Lankan Tamil literary critic. As a social reformer, Vipulanada led the movement to recognize Subramanya Bharathi, a Brahmin by birth, as the Maha Kavi (National Poet), and succeeded despite strong opposition from socially and politically powerful elites due to Bharathi's anti-castist views and his opposition to the perpetuation of the caste system and the superstitious Hindu practices and rituals. As a nationalist, he hoisted the Indian flag on the occasion of the visit of Sir George Fredrick Stanley to the Annamalai University for the 1937 convocation, while India was still a British possession. There are number of institutions named after him in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and Germany have issued stamps honoring him. He died after a brief illness on July 19, 1947. Swami Vipulanada is buried close to the Sivananda Vidyalayam in Kalladi, near Batticaloa city. (see picture here).

Such changes are often referred to as \\"patches\\" or \\"patch sets\\". Quilt can take an arbitrary number of patches as input and condense them into a single patch. In doing so, Quilt makes it easier for many programmers to test and evaluate the different changes amongst patches before they are permanently applied to the source code. Tools of this type are very important for distributed software development, in which many programmers collaborate to test and build a single large codebase. For example, quilt is heavily used by the maintainers of the Linux kernel. Quilt evolved from a set of patch-management scripts originally written by Linux kernel developer Andrew Morton, and was developed by Andreas Gr√ºnbacher for maintaining Linux kernel customizations for SuSE Linux. It is now being developed as a community effort, hosted at the GNU Savannah project repository and distributed as free software (its license is the GNU General Public License v2, or later). Quilt's name originated from patchwork quilts. Quilt has been incorporated into dpkg, Debian's package manager, and is one of the standard source formats supported from the Debian \\"squeeze\\" release onwards. This source format is identified as \\"3.0 (quilt)\\" by dpkg. Quilt is integrated into the Buildroot, which is notably used by OpenWrt.

His design work and university teaching in the years following World War II helped define and establish the California modernism style in the post- war period. During his sixty years of professional practice Royston completed an array of award-winning projects that ranged from residential gardens to regional land use plans. He is perhaps best known for his important innovations in park design. A recent book, Modern Public Gardens: Robert Royston and the Suburban Park, details this area of his professional creativity and philosophy. Early life Royston was born in 1918 in San Francisco, California. He grew up on a farm in the Santa Clara Valley of Northern California in the town on Morgan Hill. As a high school student he demonstrated a talent for drawing, dramatic performance, and athletics. One teacher advised him to be either an attorney or a ballet dancer. He pursued instead his interest in design and the outdoors and upon graduation in 1936 enrolled in the program for \\"Landscape Design\\" in the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley. Royston's mentor, H. Leland Vaughan, allowed him to experiment on his own with the new design perspectives emerging in the innovative work of Thomas Church and the more avant-garde explorations of Daniel Kiley, Garrett Eckbo, and James Rose. Royston's interest in painting, which he continued to pursue in order to explore aesthetic principles applicable to his design work, can be traced to the studio art classes that were a part of his early education. While working his way through college, Royston was employed part-time in the office of Thomas Church and upon graduation in 1940 became a full-time employee. At the time Church was expanding his practice, which had been centered primarily on residential gardens, to include the design of larger-scale planned residential communities and college campuses. Young Royston was given major responsibilities on such San Francisco projects as the Valencia Gardens Housing Project in the Mission District (by architect William Wurster), the Potrero Hill Housing project, and the large Park Merced Apartment complex near the Pacific Ocean. He also was an early member of 'Telesis', an informal group of designers concerned with environmental problems of the San Francisco Bay Area. Here he met several of the architects he was later to collaborate with on various projects as well as his future professional partner, Garrett Eckbo. With the outbreak of World War II, Royston volunteered for the Navy and served as a junior officer in the Pacific theatre. In his spare time aboard ship, Royston experimented with design ideas, building models of residential gardens and creating jewelry out of scrap materials. In 1945 Royston returned to the Bay Area and accepted Garrett Eckbo's invitation to form a partnership with him and landscape architect Edward Williams. The new firm, Eckbo, Royston, and Williams, eventually established offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 1947 Royston accepted a teaching position at the University of California Berkeley while continuing his professional practice. His students included both architects and landscape architects. His teaching career at Berkeley ended in 1951 when he resigned after refusing to sign a loyalty oath. Soon after leaving Berkeley, he accepted a part-time position at Stanford University and later at North Carolina State University. Over the course of his career he taught and lectured at over twenty-five colleges and universities in the United States. Career Royston's early professional work was concentrated in Northern California and at first consisted mostly of residential site planning and garden design. This was a period of astronomical growth fueled by the post-War economic boom and an acute shortage of housing. Most of this growth occurred as low- density suburban development, where Royston did much of his work. His practice soon expanded to include parks, plazas, and planned residential communities. Royston collaborated on numerous residential projects with many notable San Francisco Bay Area architects. His site plans emphasized the integration of indoor and outdoor space and elegant, functional garden rooms for outdoor living. Royston's specific design vocabulary of layered, non-axial spaces and bold asymmetrical arcs and polygons suggests such influences as analytical cubism, biomorphism, and the rectilinear geometry of Mondrian's paintings. The approach to architectural space of Mies Van der Rohe and Le Corbusier are also clearly visible. Royston regards space as the primary medium of design and insists on the absolute necessity of integrating design form with human use. For example, in a typical Royston park design, a wading pool for young children may be laid out as a visually engaging biomorphic form but at the same time is scaled to the distance a parent's voice can reach. The depth of the pool would also reflect function over pure form in that it would be shallowest in the middle where the child is farthest from parental aid. In Royston's design vocabulary there is no art for art's sake. Design form is always directly related to use and the psychological effect of space on its participants. > For Royston, landscape architecture \\"Practices the fine art of relating the > structure of culture to the nature of landscape, to the end that people can > use it, enjoy it, and preserve it.\\" In dealing with more complex projects such as planned residential communities, Royston developed early in his practice his concept of the \\"landscape matrix,\\" which he defines as \\"the linking of open space as a continuous system throughout the community establishing a strong framework whereby communities are controlled and given form.\\" An early application of the 'landscape matrix' was the plan for a cooperative housing project, 'Ladera' (1946), near Portola Valley, California. Royston's design featured a linear park which tied together the residential clusters and separated automobile and pedestrian circulation. The plan was built, but not according to Royston's specifications. Park work Bowden Park, Palo Alto CA Royston's innovative park work also began during the 1950s. His first major commission was the Standard Oil Rod and Gun Club (1950) located at the Standard Oil Refinery near Point Richmond, California, and was a recreation facility for workers at the refinery. Royston's carefully zoned design provided a gymnasium, swimming pools, imaginatively designed custom play equipment, family picnic areas, and several multi-use areas in a series of skillfully layered spaces on the site of a former skeet range and fishing pier. The biomorphic forms he employed were reminiscent of his residential design work. The facility was an immediate success and attracted the attention of the Bay Area planners representing several municipalities. Royston soon was given important park and playground commissions, many of which gained attention in the national media. Among his more important works were Krusi Park in Alameda, California, Pixie Place in Marin County, California, Bowden and Mitchell parks in Palo Alto, California (1956), and, later, Santa Clara's Central Park (1960). Royston rejected the notion of parks as primarily outdoor gymnasiums catering to a narrow range of age groups. He envisioned parks as \\"public gardens\\" serving a wide range of users, including families, very young children, and the elderly. Many of his parks contain residential scale elements such as pergolas and enclosed patio- like areas that create a sense of familiarity and intimacy. Royston also designed urban plazas, such as San Francisco's Portsmouth Square and St. Mary's Square city parks. (1952). In 1958 Royston amicably left the firm of Eckbo, Royston, Williams, and formed a new professional office with Asa Hanamoto. The firm developed into Royston, Hanamoto, Alley and Abey (RHAA) which is still in existence today. Awards Robert Royston was the recipient of many professional awards, including Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects, 1975, The American Institute of Architects Medal in 1978, and in 1989 the American Society of Landscape Architects Medal, the highest award of that professional organization.

It is unclear how many people the original theater used to seat, as only the lower section still exists. The open theater has a perfect location: the two hills that surround it keep it protected from winds that could interfere with acoustics during performances. During Roman times, the theater was also used for gladiator fights. However, since the theater was also a site of executions of Christians by the Romans, it rapidly turned to a highly disliked site by the locals. In fact, as a result of this dislike, the theater was abandoned and buried by the locals after the demise of the Roman Empire. This allowed for most of the structure to be well preserved, only to be uncovered accidentally in the 1980s. Namely, during construction work around some of the houses in the area, large stone blocks with carvings of the Greek god Dyonisius and the muses were showing up, which led archaeologists to believe that a Greek theater (Dionysus and the muses were related to the performance arts) must have been located nearby.

Mobile to mobile convergence (MMC) is a term to describe a technology used in modern computing and telephony. The term is an offshoot of fixed mobile convergence (FMC) and uses dual mode (cellular network and WiFi) phones with a special software client and an application server to connect voice calls and business applications via a VoWLAN and/or through a cellular service. Mobile to mobile convergence differs from conventional FMC in that the technology uses the WLAN to route calls via the internet as a primary function, and uses the wireless carrier network if the WLAN is not present as a secondary function. It is significant since it is viewed as a means to compete with carrier companies since the calls are routed around the cellular network. This is viewed as a more efficient use of networking technology than standard FMC solutions that are available as well, since most of the latter use the carrier network as the primary means of communication and do not leverage the lower cost and controls of internet protocol-based networks that are generally installed at most modern businesses. In theory, it also provides the capability of providing a greater voice coverage area than either carrier or WLAN technology alone since some areas do not have cellular service coverage and others do not have WiFi. The first offering known in the market successfully deploying MMC is beCherry, which is delivered by Belgian company Mondial Telecom. They offer a MMC solution on Symbian, iOS and Android.

There is a fossil site close to it, the Ipolytarnoc Fossils Nature Conservation Area. Ipolytarnoc fossils Sometimes referred to as the \\"Prehistoric Pompeii\\", Ipolytarn√≥c stores 23-17 million year old fossils. These include the teeth of 24 different species of sharks as well as the teeth of crocodiles and dolphins, an almost 100 m tall petrified pine, more than 15,000 subtropical, exotic leaves and 3,000 animal footprints of 11 species. This is one of the world's richest complex fossil footprint find site. The fossils can be viewed thanks to a volcanic catastrophe which buried a whole subtropical jungle under volcanic ash, thus preserving them. The site became protected in 1944 and is managed by the Directorate of the B√ºkk National Park. It is worth visiting because of the fossils and their high-tech interpretation. As a new development, the Site became the main gateway to the world's second transborder geopark, the Novohrad-N√≥gr√°d Geopark, in 2010. =Shark teeth= The reworked shoreline sandstone layers of the 23 Ma old sea sediments bear a very rich marine fauna. The so-called \\"shark toothbearing beds\\" contain, besides shark teeth, a mixture of bones from rays, dolphins, manatees and crocodilians. After the 1903 description of Koch, the \\"Ipolytarn√≥c shark tooth-bearing bed\\" became the characteristic marker bed of the Eggenburgian stage of the Lower Miocene in the Central Paratethys. The original fauna as described more than 100 years ago was revised recently based on new finds. The result shows a very diverse Lower Miocene shark community that includes 19 genera with 16 certain species. =Petrified forest= The giant petrified tree trunk, 42 m long, that bridged a stream of the Borokas ravine was exposed at the beginning of the 19th century. Its discovery initiated the scientific research of the site. The first scientific research activities and excavations began in 1836, led by Ferenc Kubinyi. Later investigations demonstrated that a whole forest was destroyed by the volcanism, the trees were toppled on top of the paleosurface by the nearby volcanic blast. Most of the tree remains are embedded at the sandstone-tuff transition, under the plinian ash fall unit. A detailed analysis of the petrified tree trunks revealed that the 20 Ma old rainforest held at least 7 coniferous, 4 deciduous and 1 palm species. =Leaf impressions= A recent paleobotanical study identified 64 taxa among the large collection of macrofloral remains, based on a sample of nearly 15 thousand leaves (Hably, 1985). The assemblage is dominated by laurophyllous plants, indicative of a vegetation in a warm and humid, subtropical climate. Most of the abundant plant remains are in the basal part of the rhyolite tuff, but 27 plant species have been identified from leaf imprints on the palaeosurface (footprint sandstone), too. =Fossil tracks= Abundant and well-preserved fossil vertebrate tracks are exposed on the topmost bedding planes of the Miocene river bank sandstone. The preservation of the tracks has been attributed to volcanic activity that instantly covered the paleosurface. It was Hugo B√∂ckh, who, at the base of the giant tree, originally discovered the prehistoric animal footprints in 1900. The original discovery, a 4x4 m slab with footprints was transported to Budapest within a year, where it is still displayed in the Hungarian Geological Institute's (HGI) well-known lecture hall, hence known as \\"Footprint Hall.\\" In the 1920s, 30s and 60s Ferenc Nopcsa, and later Tasn√°di also enriched the Institute's collections by excavating more footprints (Tasn√°di, 1976). In the early 1980s, the footprints were mapped during the construction of the first of several facilities built to protect them; 1298 tracks were registered on the site, while the total number reached 1644, together with the specimens in the HGI collections (Kordos, 1985). Explorations in the 1990s doubled the figure of footprints on the site to 2762. The extent of the known area with footprints explored at Ipolytarn√≥c in the last hundred years exceeds 1500 sq. m. The whole site, which is estimated as being 50-100 times larger than the currently exposed areas and is mostly continuous can only be explored after removing the rhyolite tuff bed. Such exposure of the surface containing the footprints should only be undertaken if they can be preserved from weathering. Therefore, scientific exploration only takes place gradually, and requires subsequent protective measures. Analysis of the footprints started immediately after their discovery, and it was known a hundred years ago that there were tracks of rhinoceroses, ungulates and birds. The first scientific description of the footprints was in 1935, in a book by Othenio Abel (Abel, 1935), who identified footprints of a rhinoceros, a proboscidean, cervids, an ancestral tri-ungulate horse, a large carnivore as well as birds. He illustrated them with photographs. Following the studies of Tasn√°di, the \\"Ipolytarn√≥c\\" monograph of Geologica Hungarica series Palaeontologica was issued in 1985, for the Regional Committee on Mediterranean Neogene Stratigraphy (RCMNS) congress, where L. Kordos identified 11 animal species based on all footprints known at the time. The commonest avian species are the medium-sized Ornithotarnocia lambrechti with three toeprints and the similar-sized Tetraorniothopedia tasnadii that left four toeprints behind, while Aviadactyla media is characterized by rod-like, straight toeprints. Tracks of the small songbird Passeripeda ipolyensis are present but not as common as those of the other birds. The most common mammalian footprints include the rounded and three- hooved footprints of adult and juvenile, prehistoric rhinoceroses (Rhinoceripeda tasnadyi) as well as those of smaller (Pecoripeda hamori) and larger (Megapecoripeda miocaenica) ungulates. Numerous carnivores lived here 20 million years ago. Amongst them, the largest footprints belong to the rare Bestiopeda maxima, first illustrated by Abel (1935). Astonishingly fresh- looking and distinct are the three footprints of a single individual of Carnivoripeda nogradensis, the blurry tracks of Bestiopeda tarnocensis, and the clawprints of a peculiar mustelid, Mustelipeda punctata (Kordos, 1985). History of protection Unfortunately, after surviving the volcanic catastrophe and 20 Ma, the fossil finds could not withstand the onslaught of humans. Not just laymen but scientists also caused irretrievable damage to the track and other fossil remains. Devastation already began in the year of discovery of the petrified pine, in 1836. Kubinyi at first thought of ex situ protection. He had the trunk unearthed and dragged out of the ravine by \\"11 pairs of oxen\\". The trunk was then broken into pieces, and the number of resulting fragments were then transported to nearby private museums. Later, realizing his mistake, Kubinyi had the remaining exposed parts covered with earth, \\"lest it fell prey to vandal hands, that are lamentably so common in this country and that let the so-called stonebench come to nothing.\\" Unfortunately, neither Kubinyi's efforts, nor the building, which was erected around 1860 to shelter the most endangered parts of the giant pine, could save the trunk from vandalism. Locals collected fragments of it for building stone and whetstone, swarms of \\"souvenir collectors\\" broke pieces from it, local landlords took bigger fragments of it as ornaments for their gardens, and it became a favored material for gravestones. Museums were also frequent visitors and contributed to the damage. Even the protective shelter of the tree was destroyed within two decades after its construction. The shark teeth also attracted the attention of the locals. They imaginatively called them petrified bird tongues and sold them in necklaces to the tourists, who came to visit the wonders of petrified nature. The footprint sandstone proved to be ideal cobble, building stone and was used even for the building of the protective cellar for the fossil tree. Locals held picnics on the eroded surface of the paleosurface and danced on top of the prehistoric footprints. Paleontologists excavated and collected the most exotic tracks, and left the exposed surfaces to weathering and accessible to private collectors. Several tracks were lost, and only sketches of them survive. Those, who cared for the site, stopped publishing papers, because they realized that new discoveries generated a new flow of collectors to the site. The most pro conservation scientists finally decided to stop further excavations, until everything already exposed was sheltered (Tasn√°di, 1976). Despite the fact that the site officially became protected in 1944, several decades went by before the protection became effective. Permanent staffing with guided tours along the established geological study trail in the early 1980s was the solution. Excavated areas where tracks were exposed became covered by conservation buildings, and new interpretation trails were opened later. The site has become a favored destination for tourists. Land ownership problems were solved as the area was acquired by the Hungarian state, and the B√ºkk National Park Directorate (BNPD) gained land manager status; thus the number of factors impeding conservation management was reduced significantly. The site was declared a part of the Pan-European natural heritage by the Council of Europe in 1995. The area is on the tentative list of the world heritage and a European Diploma holding site. Geotourism of the Ipolytarn√≥c Fossils As the scientific and information centre of the Novohrad-N√≥gr√°d Geopark, the site provides several programmes for a whole day, including guided tours along its famous geological study trail or world-class 4D movies about the prehistoric past in its Visitor Centre. It is a favourite destination for geotourism, its geological trail was opened to the public in 1986.

It is issued by the King Committee on Corporate Governance. Three reports were issued in 1994 (King I), 2002 (King II), and 2009 (King III) and a fourth revision (King IV) in 2016. The Institute of Directors in Southern Africa (IoDSA) owns the copyright of the King Report on Corporate Governance and the King Code of Corporate Governance. Compliance with the King Reports is a requirement for companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The King Report on Corporate Governance has been cited as \\"the most effective summary of the best international practices in corporate governance\\". History In July 1993 the Institute of Directors in South Africa asked retired Supreme Court of South Africa judge Mervyn E. King to chair a committee on corporate governance. He viewed this as an opportunity to educate the newly democratic South African public on the working of a free economy. The committee's report was to be the first report of its kind in South Africa. Committee members included Phillip Armstrong, Nigel Payne, and Richard Wilkinson. Approach  Unlike other corporate governance codes such as Sarbanes-Oxley, the code is non-legislative and is based on principles and practices. It also espouses an apply or explain approach, unique to the Netherlands until King and now also found in the 2010 Combined Code from the United Kingdom. The philosophy of the code consists of the three key elements of leadership, sustainability and good corporate citizenship. It views good governance as essentially being effective, ethical leadership. King believes that leaders should direct the company to achieve sustainable economic, social and environmental performance. It views sustainability as the primary moral and economic imperative of this century; the code's view on corporate citizenship flows from a company's standing as a juristic person under the South African constitution and should operate in a sustainable manner. King I In 1994 the first King report on corporate governance (King 1) was published, the first corporate governance code for South Africa. It established recommended standards of conduct for boards and directors of listed companies, banks, and certain state-owned enterprises. It included not only financial and regulatory aspects, but also advocated an integrated approach that involved all stakeholders. It was applicable to all companies listed on the main board of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, large public entities as defined by the Public Entities Act of South Africa; banks, financial and insurance companies as defined by the Financial Services Acts of South Africa; and large unlisted companies. It defined \\"large\\" as companies with shareholder equity over R50 million, but encouraged all companies to adopt the code. The key principles from the first King report covered: * Board of directors makeup and mandate, including the role of non-executive directors and guidance on the categories of people who should make up the non-executive directors * Appointments to the board and guidance on the maximum term for executive directors * Determination and disclosure of executive and non- executive director‚Äôs remuneration * Board meeting frequency * Balanced annual reporting * The requirement for effective auditing * Affirmative action programs * The company‚Äôs code of ethics King II In 2002, when the Earth Summit was held in Johannesburg, King pushed for a revision of the report (King II), including new sections on sustainability, the role of the corporate board, and risk management. This revised code of governance was applicable from March 2002. In addition to those types of organizations listed in King I, it was applicable to departments of State or national, provincial or local government administration falling under the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Act, and public institution or functionary exercising a power or performing a function in terms of the constitution, or exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of any legislation, excluding courts or judicial officers. As before, it encourages all companies to adopt the applicable principles from the code. The key principles from the second King report covered the following areas: * Directors and their responsibility * Risk management * Internal audit * Integrated sustainability reporting * Accounting and auditing =Legislative Enforcement= As before, the code is not enforced through legislation. However, it co-exists with a number of laws that apply to companies and directors including the Companies Act. In addition further enforcement takes place by regulations such as the JSE Securities Exchange Listings Requirements. King III In an interview with Mervin King, he considered the King II report was wrong to include sustainability as a separate chapter, leading companies to report on it separately from other factors. In the next version, the 2009 King III report, governance, strategy and sustainability were integrated. The report recommends that organisations produce an integrated report in place of an annual financial report and a separate sustainability report and that companies create sustainability reports according to the Global Reporting Initiative's Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. In contrast to the earlier versions, King III is applicable to all entities, public, private and non-profit. King encourages all entities to adopt the King III principles and explain how these have been applied or are not applicable. The code of governance was applicable from March 2010. The report incorporated a number of global emerging governance trends: * Alternative dispute resolution * Risk-based internal audit * Shareholder approval of non-executive directors‚Äô remuneration * Evaluation of board and directors‚Äô performance It also incorporated a number of new principles to address elements not previously included in the King reports: * IT governance * Business Rescue * Fundamental and affected transactions in terms of director‚Äôs responsibilities during mergers, acquisitions and amalgamations. Again, the code of corporate governance is not enforced through legislation. However, due to evolutions in South African law many of the principles put forward in King II are now embodied as law in the Companies Act of South Africa of 2008. In addition to the Companies Act, there are additional applicable statutes that encapsulate some of the principles of King III such as the Public Finance Management Act and the Promotion of Access to Information Act. *Integrated reporting *The Unites Nations Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment *OECD Guidelines for Multinational Companies *Global Reporting Initiative‚Äôs G3 guidelines *The United Kingdom Companies Act of 2006 King IV \\"There have been significant corporate governance and regulatory developments, locally and internationally, since King III was issued in 2009 which need to be taken into account. The other consideration is that whilst listed companies are generally applying King III, non-profit organisations, private companies and entities in the public sector have experienced challenges in interpreting and adapting King III to their particular circumstances. The enhancement will aim to make King IV more accessible to all types of entities across sectors.\\" King IV was published on 1 November 2016. Providing for a 2-year period in respect of the drafting process and another year grace period to allow organisations to implement, King IV will probably become effective from middle 2017. The Institute of Directors in Southern Africa (IoDSA) is the custodian of the King reports and the holder of their copyrights. Ansie Ramalho from the IoDSA, with the assistance of Parmi Natesan and Julie Dixon, leads the project management of the redrafting process and serves as the editor of the various drafts. The King Committee governs the drafting process and will ultimately approve of the King IV Report.

He is best known today as the author of Beatha Aodha Ruaidh U√≠ Dhomhnaill, a biography of Red Hugh O'Donnell. Life Born in T√≠r Conaill (modern-day County Donegal), Lughaidh was the cousin of renowned Gaelic historian M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh and one of five sons of Maccon √ì Cl√©irigh, a court poet to the O'Donnells. The √ì Cl√©irighs had a long tradition as one of Gaelic Ireland's foremost learned families, and the T√≠r Conaill branch had served the O'Donnells for over two hundred years. Lughaidh and his brothers are the last generation of their sept to be included in the √ì Cl√©irigh genealogies of the 17th-century. In the lead up to the Ulster Plantation, he was involved as a juror and commissioner in the land surveys in Donegal. Lughaidh participated in the Contention of the bards, an event which probably took place between 1616 and 1624. Of the thirty poems produced by the participants, four were reportedly written by √ì Cl√©irigh. The 19th-century historian John O'Donovan believed that Lughaidh √ì Cl√©irigh was the father of the annalist Cucoigriche (Peregrine) √ì Cl√©irigh, but this has since been disputed. The date of Lughaidh √ì Cl√©irigh's death is unknown. Beatha Aodha Ruaidh U√≠ Dhomhnaill √ì Cl√©irigh is best known as the author of Beatha Aodha Ruaidh U√≠ Dhomhnaill (Life of Red Hugh O'Donnell), a biography of Red Hugh, a leader in the Nine Years' War. The work was a major source for the account of the period given in the Annals of the Four Masters and is the fullest contemporary source for O'Donnell's life and career. Lughaidh's work is identified in the Annals merely as the book of Lughaidh √ì Cl√©irigh. The vagueness of the description led many early scholars to conclude that Cucoigriche √ì Cl√©irigh had authored the work. In his 1851 edition of the Annals O'Donovan cited Cucoigriche as the author of the Beatha, believing it to be a different text to the work attributed to Lughaidh by the annalists. Eugene O'Curry was the first to attribute the Beatha to Lughaidh, suggesting that Cucoigriche was merely the scribe. Beatha Aodha Ruaidh U√≠ Dhomhnaill is composed in ornate and archaic form of Irish. Unsurprisingly it has a strong Donegal bias. The text survives in one contemporary manuscript, Dublin, Royal Irish Academy MS 23 P 24, written in the hand of Cucoigriche √ì Cl√©irigh. The work was first edited and translated by Denis Murphy in 1895. A fuller Irish Texts Society edition by Paul Walsh was published in two volumes in 1948 and 1957.

Emelec, named for the first syllable of each word in the company's name, is one of Ecuador's leading football clubs. Biography Capwell was born on July 1, 1902 in Olean, New York. He was known for his love of athletics, particularly American football, basketball, swimming, and baseball. When he was young, he lived for a time in Panama, where his father was an engineer involved in the construction of the Panama Canal. He studied electrical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. After graduating, he took a job as an assistant engineer at a power plant in Cienfuegos, Cuba. He later spent time in Panama. Standing over tall and weighing over , Capwell was noted for his organizational and leadership skills. Emelec Capwell arrived in Guayaquil to work at El√©ctrica on April 14, 1926. Soon after arriving, he founded a sports club, named for the first syllable of each word in the company's name: Emelec. He boxed and played basketball at the guard position; he organized basketball competitions at the company in 1927. He played the catcher's position in baseball games. Potential members of the boxing club had to perform well in a fight against one of the club's experienced boxers in order to gain membership. He wasn't particularly interested in association football, but a request from the employees lead him to found a team, particularly since the workers were not particularly enthusiastic about Emelec's other sports. The football team, composed solely of El√©ctrica workers, was founded on April 28, 1929.

It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built. A similar data structure is the interval tree. A segment tree for a set of n intervals uses O(n log n) storage and can be built in O(n log n) time. Segment trees support searching for all the intervals that contain a query point in O(log n + k), k being the number of retrieved intervals or segments. Applications of the segment tree are in the areas of computational geometry, and geographic information systems. The segment tree can be generalized to higher dimension spaces. Structure description This section describes the structure of a segment tree in a one-dimensional space. Let S be a set of intervals, or segments. Let p1, p2, ..., pm be the list of distinct interval endpoints, sorted from left to right. Consider the partitioning of the real line induced by those points. The regions of this partitioning are called elementary intervals. Thus, the elementary intervals are, from left to right: :(-\\\\infty, p_1), [p_1,p_1], (p_1, p_2), [p_2, p_2], \\\\dots, (p_{m-1}, p_m), [p_m, p_m], (p_m, +\\\\infty) That is, the list of elementary intervals consists of open intervals between two consecutive endpoints pi and pi+1, alternated with closed intervals consisting of a single endpoint. Single points are treated themselves as intervals because the answer to a query is not necessarily the same at the interior of an elementary interval and its endpoints. upright=1.9 Given a set of intervals, or segments, a segment tree T for is structured as follows: * T is a binary tree. * Its leaves correspond to the elementary intervals induced by the endpoints in , in an ordered way: the leftmost leaf corresponds to the leftmost interval, and so on. The elementary interval corresponding to a leaf v is denoted Int(v). * The internal nodes of T correspond to intervals that are the union of elementary intervals: the interval Int(N) corresponding to node N is the union of the intervals corresponding to the leaves of the tree rooted at N. That implies that Int(N) is the union of the intervals of its two children. * Each node or leaf v in T stores the interval Int(v) and a set of intervals, in some data structure. This canonical subset of node v contains the intervals [x, x‚Ä≤] from such that [x, x‚Ä≤] contains Int(v) and does not contain Int(parent(v)). That is, each node in T stores the segments that span through its interval, but do not span through the interval of its parent. Storage requirements This section analyzes the storage cost of a segment tree in a one-dimensional space. A segment tree T on a set of n intervals uses O(n log n) storage. :The set has at most 4n + 1 elementary intervals. Because T is a binary balanced tree with at most 4n + 1 leaves, its height is O(log n). Since any interval is stored at most twice at a given depth of the tree, that the total amount of storage is O(n log n). Construction This section describes the construction of a segment tree in a one-dimensional space. A segment tree from the set of segments , can be built as follows. First, the endpoints of the intervals in are sorted. The elementary intervals are obtained from that. Then, a balanced binary tree is built on the elementary intervals, and for each node v it is determined the interval Int(v) it represents. It remains to compute the canonical subsets for the nodes. To achieve this, the intervals in are inserted one by one into the segment tree. An interval X = [x, x‚Ä≤] can be inserted in a subtree rooted at T, using the following procedure: * If Int(T) is contained in X then store X at T, and finish. * Else: ** If X intersects the interval of the left child of T, then insert X in that child, recursively. ** If X intersects the interval of the right child of T, then insert X in that child, recursively. The complete construction operation takes O(n log n) time, n being the number of segments in . Query This section describes the query operation of a segment tree in a one-dimensional space. A query for a segment tree, receives a point qx(should be one of the leaves of tree), and retrieves a list of all the segments stored which contain the point qx. Formally stated; given a node (subtree) v and a query point qx, the query can be done using the following algorithm: * Report all the intervals in I(v). * If v is not a leaf: ** If qx is in Int(left child of v) then *** Perform a query in the left child of v. ** If qx is in Int(right child of v) then *** Perform a query in the right child of v. In a segment tree that contains n intervals, those containing a given query point can be reported in O(log n + k) time, where k is the number of reported intervals. Generalization for higher dimensions The segment tree can be generalized to higher dimension spaces, in the form of multi-level segment trees. In higher dimensional versions, the segment tree stores a collection of axis-parallel (hyper-)rectangles, and can retrieve the rectangles that contain a given query point. The structure uses O(n logd n) storage, and answers queries in O(logd n). The use of fractional cascading lowers the query time bound by a logarithmic factor. The use of the interval tree on the deepest level of associated structures lowers the storage bound by a logarithmic factor. Notes A query that asks for all the intervals containing a given point is often referred as a stabbing query. The segment tree is less efficient than the interval tree for range queries in one dimension, due to its higher storage requirement: O(n log n) against the O(n) of the interval tree. The importance of the segment tree is that the segments within each node‚Äôs canonical subset can be stored in any arbitrary manner. For n intervals whose endpoints are in a small integer range (e.g., in the range [1,‚Ä¶,O(n)]), optimal data structures exist with a linear preprocessing time and query time O(1 + k) for reporting all k intervals containing a given query point. Another advantage of the segment tree is that it can easily be adapted to counting queries; that is, to report the number of segments containing a given point, instead of reporting the segments themselves. Instead of storing the intervals in the canonical subsets, it can simply store the number of them. Such a segment tree uses linear storage, and requires an O(log n) query time, so it is optimal. Higher dimensional versions of the interval tree and the priority search tree do not exist; that is, there is no clear extension of these structures that solves the analogous problem in higher dimensions. But the structures can be used as associated structure of segment trees. History The segment tree was invented by Jon Louis Bentley in 1977; in \\"Solutions to Klee‚Äôs rectangle problems\\".

Originally from Houston, Texas, she is best known for influencing policy through her long association and political relation with the President of Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq (1977‚Äì88). Herring also served as the honorary consul at the Consulate-General of Pakistan based in Houston; on special request and favor of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq she is also the recipient of the Jinnah Medal, one of Pakistan's highest honors. Throughout the 1980s, Herring created the United States support for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan by assisting the U.S. Representative Charlie Wilson to persuade the U.S. government to train and arm the Mujahideen resistance fighters to fight in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, which began in 1979, known as Operation Cyclone. These events inspired the book Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History; Herring is portrayed by actress Julia Roberts in the 2007 film Charlie Wilson's War. Since the September 11 attacks, Herring has stated that she \\"did not make al-Qaeda\\" and that she \\"cannot predict the future.\\" Herring remains very active in social circles in Houston and regularly contributes to and participates in benefits to help American troops and the Afghan people. Her second book, Diplomacy and Diamonds: My Wars from the Ballroom to the Battlefield, was released on January 1, 2011. Life and work Herring was born Joanne Johnson in Houston, the daughter of Maelan (McGill) and William Dunlap Johnson. Herring grew up in the city's affluent River Oaks neighborhood, and her childhood acquaintances included James A. Baker, III, who would later serve as Secretary of State. She enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, but left after her sophomore year to marry real estate developer Robert King. A fixture on the Houston social circuit, Herring became notorious for the lavish, decadent birthday party her husband threw for her in 1959. The \\"Roman orgy\\"-themed affair included period costumes and a mock slave auction, and was covered by Life magazine and various local news media. In the late 1950s, she began a 15-year-long hosting tenure for the eponymous daytime talk show \\"The Joanne King Show\\" on Houston's KHOU-TV station. By 1974, her show had moved to KPRC. Media appearances Herring appears as herself in the comic 1999 documentary feature Five Wives, Three Secretaries and Me and the 1970s German television news series V.I.P.-Schaukel. In the former‚Äîthe story of a Houston businessman who marries five times‚ÄîHerring playfully introduces herself by saying, \\"Well, my name is Joanne Johnson King Herring Davis, and I've had almost as many husbands as he's had, wives.\\" Herring has also appeared on CNN with Ali Velshi multiple times to discuss continued American involvement in Afghanistan. Marshall Plan Charities In 2009, Herring founded Marshall Plan Charities, which seeks to \\"complement the ongoing U.S. military effort in Afghanistan by rapidly and effectively redeveloping normal, healthy civilian life village by village.\\" The organization unites the efforts of various NGO's concerned with the Afghan people in hopes of providing villages with clean water, food, healthcare, schools, and jobs. Involvement with Zia-ul-Haq Herring is known for her long association and political engagement with president of Pakistan Zia-ul- Haq. Her contacts with Zia dated back to the early 1970s, when he, as brigadier-general, was a contingent commander of Pakistani military formations in Jordan. In 1980, Zia convened and held a dinner in honor of Robert and Joanne Herring in Islamabad. About the military intelligence program run against the prime minister Zulfikar Bhutto, Herring reportedly defended Zia's action. She also wrote that [Zulfikar] Bhutto \\"was tried by his own judges and convicted of murder. The Koran serves as the unofficial constitution of Pakistan. It exacts an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. If you murder, you must die. The only thing Zia did was to not commute Bhutto's sentence. In a country whose constitution demanded capital punishment for murder, Zia could not violate the Law.\\" In Charlie Wilson's War, George Crile III maintained that \\"Herring was said to have been a most trusted American adviser in President Zia's administration.\\" It was Herring who acquainted Charlie Wilson with Zia who later secured major funding for Pakistan's anti-communist policies. Over the years, Herring's influence on Zia and his military administration grew further, and Zia became so enamoured with her that he would interrupt cabinet meetings to take her call. Said Foreign minister Yaqub Khan in his memoirs: \\"She absolutely had his ear, it was terrible!\\" Zia neglected protocols and dismayed the Foreign Office when he appointed her his honorary consul at the Houston-based Consulate-General of Pakistan. In a public ceremony held in Pakistan, Zia personally honored her with Pakistan's highest civilian honor, the Tamgha-e-Quaid-e-Azam (lit. Jinnah Medal). She paid tribute to Zia in her 2011 autobiography. Husain Haqqani, former Pakistan Ambassador and former adviser to three Pakistani prime ministers, described Herring as \\"known more for glamour than for political wisdom,\\" and Zia \\"showered her with hospitality to use her connections.\\", page 256 Haqqani described her as knowing \\"little about the country,\\" criticizing her for inaccurately describing Pakistan as an \\"Arab nation\\" in her memoirs.

The formation of the organization was prompted by the disclosure of the My Lai Massacre on November 12, 1969 by Seymour Hersh, writing for the New York Times. The group was the first to bring to public attention the testimony of American Vietnam War veterans who had witnessed or participated in atrocities. Origins Schoenman had previously worked on the International War Crimes Tribunal founded by Bertrand Russell. Schoenman left the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam in the hands of two New Left anti-war activists, Tod Ensign and Jeremy Rifkin. They were joined in early 1970 by several Vietnam War veterans, including Robert Bowie Johnson, a West Point graduate and former infantry captain, and Michael Uhl, a retired 1st lieutenant in military intelligence. American Vietnam War veterans and GIs offer personal witness to war crimes =Overview= The National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam's first press conference was in Toronto, Canada, March 4, 1970. Ensign and Rifkin convened three more press conferences in the following two months: Springfield, Massachusetts (April 6, 1970); New York City, New York and Los Angeles, California (April 14); and Boston, Massachusetts (May 7, 1970). Uhl then traveled to Sweden and Australia to brief reporters that American Vietnam war veterans had first-hand evidence of atrocities they had either witnessed or committed themselves. National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam continued to mount press conferences in other cities, culminating in a three-day National Veterans Inquiry, held in Washington, D.C. on December 1, 2 and 3. The testimony offered by veterans at these events provided documentation that American atrocities in Vietnam were not uncommon. This evidence was a counterpoint to the U.S. Army command's assertion that the My Lai massacre was an exception. National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam leaders asserted that atrocities committed by American soldiers were a result of military field policies like \\"search-and-destroy\\", \\"free-fire zones\\" and \\"forced urbanization\\", the saturation bombing of villages believed to be controlled by enemy forces. =Major events= * April 7, 1970: David Bressam, a former Army officer; Peter Fossell, a former Marine Corps rifleman; and Robert B. Johnson, a former Army captain and chaplain. They allege that Col. Lewis Beasley, 1st Air Cav Div of 9th Cavalry, from his helicopter killed Vietnamese civilians who were \\"taking evasive action.\\" Location: Central highlands north of Dak To. Date: August 1967. * May 7, 1970: Larry Rottman, a retired first lieutenant, affirmed that he had seen nerve gas stored at the Bien Hoa American air base while stationed there in 1967 and 1968. Michael Uhl, 1st Lt., military intelligence, Americal Division, witnessed electrical torture 15 times. * July 19, 1970: Six recently returned Army veterans tell of using electricity to torture prisoners. The veterans offering testimony are: Robert Stemme, Sgt, 172nd Military Intelligence Dept., attached to 173rd Airborne Brigade; Michael Uhl, 1st Lt., military intelligence, Americal Division; Peter Martinsen, Sp/5, 542nd MI Detachment, 101st Airborne Division; John Patton, 2nd Lt., 11th Regiment, Americal Division; Edward Murphy, Sgt., 4th MI Detachment, 4th Infantry Division; Fred Brown, 172nd Military Intelligence Dept., attached to 173rd Airborne Brigade. * October 28, 1970: Mike McCusker, Sgt., 1st Battalion, 5th Regiment, 5th Marine Infantry Division, reveals that on September 6, 1966, his unit destroyed everything that moved in two villages near Chu Lai. Michael Shepherd, Special Forces medic, 101st Airborne Division, reported witnessing the shooting of wounded prisoners. Nick Kinler, chemical warfare specialist, told of witnessing the massacre by American troops of villagers who were chased from bunkers by tear gas. * November 24, 1970: Three active duty officers and three veterans blame U.S. commanders for policies that lead to atrocities committed by ground-level troops. The active duty Army officers, all stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, were: Capt. Edward Fox, Capt. Grier Merwin, and Capt. Robert Masters. The three veterans were: Louis Font, Lt., a West Point graduate; Robert Johnson, Army Capt.; and T. Griffith Ellison, Marine Corps Lance Corporal. * December 1‚Äì3, 1970: Forty veterans of the Vietnam War testify in the Dupont Plaza Hotel in Washington, D.C. at the National Veterans Inquiry into U.S. War Crimes Policy. They testify about the atrocities they either witnessed or participated in. They share a single opinion that war crimes committed by American soldiers in Vietnam were the logical consequence of command policies. Among those testifying were four West Point graduates: Louis Font, Robert Master, Bob Johnson and Gordon Livingston. Others whose testimony was cited by reporters include Steven Hassett (1st Air Cavalry Division), Stephen S. Naetzel (Sgt.), Edward Murphy (Sgt.), and Kenneth B. Osborne (intelligence specialist). * April 26‚Äì27, 1971: [slug: Dellums hearings] * August 2, 1971: Michael Uhl gave testimony about the Phoenix Program under oath to the Congressional Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations of the U.S. House of Representatives. Impact and legacy Telford Taylor, former chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials stated on the Dick Cavett Show that General William Westmoreland might be convicted as a war criminal if Nuremberg principles from World War II were applied to the Vietnam War. Taylor, himself a retired brigadier general in the Army Reserve, explained that the U.S. Army applied this standard of justice in the trial of Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita. Yamashita was convicted of war crimes and hanged for atrocities committed by his troops in the Philippines. Taylor attributed his opinion to the evidence of atrocities and war crimes offered by veterans and active-duty soldiers, who were testifying under the auspices of the Citizens Commission of Inquiry. The Concerned Officers Movement (COM) held two press conferences under the auspices of the Citizens Commission of Inquiry on January 12, 1971 in Washington, D.C. and January 20, 1971 in Los Angeles calling for an investigation into the \\"responsibility for war crimes of key military figures\\", including Generals William Westmoreland and Creighton Abrams, and Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. The Washington, D.C. COM members involved were CAPT Robert Master, USA and CAPT Grier Merwin, USA, both doctors; Capt. Edward G. Fox, a zoologist in the Army Medical Service Corps; First Lieutenant Louis Font, a West Point graduate; and LTJG Peter Dunkelberger, USN, a management systems analyst stationed at the Pentagon. In Los Angeles were LT Norman Banks, USAF, LTJG Ted Shallcross, USN, LT James Skelly, USN, and LTJG John Kent, USN, an Annapolis graduate, all-American wrestler and jet fighter pilot. The Winter Soldier Investigation, which ran from January 31, 1971 to February 2, 1971, followed in the paths of both the Citizens Commission of Inquiry and the Russell Tribunal. This event was organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and some of its leaders have credited the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam with establishing the credibility of veterans' voices of dissent. Internal divisions between the two groups led each to work independently of the other. The Citizens Commission of Inquiry disbanded in December 1971.

He was editor of the humorous weekly magazine Punch from 1957 to 1968.  Life and career  Born on 3 June 1910 at Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, Bernard Hollowood was educated at Hanley High School and St Paul's College, Cheltenham. He read economics at London University and graduated in 1936. He subsequently taught commerce, economics and geography at the City School of Commerce, Stoke-on-Trent. He moved to Loughborough College in 1941, where he was Head of the Commerce Department. He was a self-taught artist. He generally used a mapping pen and Indian ink on Whatman paper. Though not a good draughtsman, he sold his first drawings to Chamber's Journal, Lilliput and Men Only in 1942. Before long he was contributing drawings and articles to Punch. He left Loughborough College in 1944 and joined the staff of The Economist. He stayed with the journal until 1945, becoming Assistant Editor. He was an expert on industrial ceramics, and was editor of Pottery and Glass from 1944 to 1950. From 1946 to 1947 he was Research Officer at the Council of Industrial Design. Hollowood was elected to the Punch Table in 1945. He was appointed the magazine's editor in 1957. He set very high standards, and would often require cartoonists to revise their submissions several times. Under him, Punch's circulation continued at around 115,000 copies, but he never became as well known as Malcolm Muggeridge, his immediate predecessor as editor. He left Punch in 1968. From 1957 to 1960 he was a pocket cartoonist for the Sunday Times. He was also a regular contributor of articles or cartoons to many other publications, including The Times, Geographical Magazine, Socialist Commentary, the Surrey Advertiser, News Chronicle, The Cricketer, London Opinion, The New Yorker, the Evening Standard, and the Daily and Sunday Telegraph. As well as his own name, he also wrote and drew as 'Mammon'. A small selection of his cartoons is viewable online at the British Cartoon Archive.Some Hollowood cartoons He was a member of the Court of Governors of the London School of Economics. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) in 1949. In 1962 he was awarded the Silver Medal of the Society for his lecture on humour. Bernard Levin interviewed him for his TV series The Levin Interview in 1966.  The cricketer  He was a good enough cricketer to play Minor Counties cricket for Staffordshire between 1930 and 1947 as a batsman and occasional bowler, and he also captained Burslem who played in the North Staffordshire League. His father and two brothers also played for Staffordshire. One of his Staffordshire team-mates was the great bowler Sydney Barnes, whose last match for Staffordshire was in 1935. Hollowood drew two cartoons of Barnes, which appear in his book Cricket on the Brain. One depicts him leaping in the air as he appeals for a dismissal and with his index finger raised as though he himself is adjudicating on the appeal. It is entitled 'A.N. Other lbw Barnes.... 0'.Cricket on the Brain, p69. John Arlott wrote in his review of the book for Wisden: \\"...his two caricatures of S.F. Barnes would seem transcendent if they were not outweighed by his chapter on that great bowler which is a fine passage of cricket literature... this is a book of many and well-cut facets.\\"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1971 edition, p1070.

North Texas University Parker played college football at North Texas University. While playing at North Texas, Will made All Missouri Valley Conference in 1969 and 1970. In 2013 Will was voted as the Center for the North Texas All Century Team (1913-2013). In 2016 the North Texas Hall of Fame committee voted Will into the North Texas Hall of Fame. San Francisco 49ers Parker was originally drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 1971 NFL Draft, made the Taxi Squad and participated in all practices for the entire season. Buffalo Bills Traded to Buffalo in 1973 as a snapper, center and backup guard; playing 8 years for the Bills. In 1976, going into his fourth year with the Buffalo Bills, Parker became their starting center. Despite a strong middle of the offensive line with Parker flanking left guard Reggie McKenzie and Hall-of-Fame right guard Joe DeLamielleure in all 14 games, that team had a 3-11 won-lost record, the offense scoring only 160 points (11.4 points/game), 26th among 28 teams in the NFL. In 1977 OJ Simpson Buffalo's outstanding running back '77 season in Buffalo was cut short by injury. Before the 1978 season, the Bills traded OJ Simpson to the San Francisco 49ers for a series of draft picks.[18] Willie played three seasons with the team's fortune improving to 5-11 in 1978 and 7-9 in 1979, the first two years with Chuck Knox as the head coach, the same linemen trio up the middle in all 16 games during three years. However, in the following year, Parker was traded to the Detroit Lions to help in rebuilding Detroit's offensive line. Detroit Lions In 1980, his final year in the NFL, Parker went to the Detroit Lions, starting only once in 4 games, as a career-ending injury occurred in his final game against the Chicago Bears. Willie came back to the Detroit Lions in 1981 Training Camp and due to work related issue, decided to retire. In all Willie spent 11 years in the NFL.

During the third week of development, the lateral mesoderm splits into a dorsal somatic mesoderm (somatopleure) and a ventral splanchnic mesoderm (splanchnopleure). The resulting cavity between the somatopleure and splanchnopleure is called the intraembryonic coelom. This space will give rise to the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The coelomic spaces in the lateral mesoderm and cardiogenic area are isolated. The isolated coelom begins to organize into a horseshoe shape. The spaces soon join together and form a single horseshoe-shaped cavity, the intraembryonic coelom which separates the mesoderm into two layers. It briefly has a connection with the extraembryonic coelom.

In the Deutsch catalog of Schubert's works it is number D547. The original key is D major. It was published in 1827 as Opus 88, No. 4, by . Schubert dedicated the song to the Viennese piano virtuoso Albert Sowinsky on April 24, 1827, a decade after he composed it. A hymn to the art of music, it is one of the best-known songs by Schubert. Its greatness and popularity are generally attributed to its harmonic simplicity, sweeping melody, and a strong bass line that effectively underpins the vocal line. Text Du holde Kunst, in wieviel grauen Stunden, Wo mich des Lebens wilder Kreis umstrickt, Hast du mein Herz zu warmer Lieb' entzunden, Hast mich in eine be√üre Welt entr√ºckt, In eine be√üre Welt entr√ºckt! Oft hat ein Seufzer, deiner Harf' entflo√üen, Ein s√º√üer, heiliger Akkord von dir, Den Himmel be√ürer Zeiten mir erschlo√üen, Du holde Kunst, ich danke dir daf√ºr, Du holde Kunst, ich danke dir! Translation\\"An die Musik\\" / \\"To Music\\", schubert.org O blessed art, how often in dark hours, When the savage ring of life tightens round me, Have you kindled warm love in my heart, Have transported me to a better world! Transported to a better world Often a sigh has escaped from your harp, A sweet, sacred harmony of yours Has opened up the heavens to better times for me, O blessed art, I thank you for that! O blessed art, I thank you! Incipit of \\"An die Musik\\" The poem was not included in the collected editions of Schober's poems, but there is a handwritten copy of it in Vienna. It resembles the second canto of Ernst Schulze's poem \\"Die bezauberte Rose\\" (The Enchanted Rose), a poem also known to Schubert as a possible basis for an opera; however, it was published in 1818, so it is unlikely that there was any connection between them for the composer. Other Portrait of Franz Schubert by Franz Eybl (1827) At the end of Gerald Moore's farewell concert in London's Royal Festival Hall in 1967, in which he accompanied Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Victoria de los √Ångeles and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, he came out onto the stage alone and played the piano part of \\"An die Musik\\" as his parting gift. This song is sung in unison by all of the members of the National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) who are present at the end of each of its national conventions. It was also performed by Garrett Morris on Saturday Night Live on May 22, 1976. The opening track of folk artist Josephine Foster's 2006 album, A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing, is a rendition of the lied. The song is used in the 2004 film Look at Me and the 2012 film Moonrise Kingdom.

It belongs to the Valle de Guadalhorce comarca and is 44 kilometres from the provincial capital of M√°laga and 20 kilometres from Marbella. Located in a fertile land for fruit: almonds and olives, between the Rio Grande valley and the mountains, Guaro is the entrance to the Sierra de las Nieves Natural Park, declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO and next to the third national park in Andalusia. Geography Guaro is at an altitude of 354 metres above sea level near the Sierra de Mijas. The land area is 22 square kilometres. Guaro's main economical activities are olive and almond agriculture, along with other traditional irrigated crops, and oddly- enough, as of 2006 the number of women with work contracts doubled that of men. History Prehistoric remains have been found dating back to the earliest humans in the area in prehistory, although the nucleus of the population is found with the entry of the Arabs in the south of the peninsula. The first settlement in the area dates from Arabic times and was located at the place known as Old Guaro, at the feet of a tower that once was part of the line of fortifications of Guadalhorce valley. The municipality was conquered by the Catholic Monarchs in 1485. Guaro became an independent village on 1614 by decree of King Philip IV of Spain. The city is notable for its typical Andalus streets lined with white houses festooned with flowers. Its main monument is Saint Michel's parish, built in the 16th century and reformed in the early 17th century by Pedro D√≠as de Palacios, that exhibits a square, two- bodied tower and no lateral vessels. Monuments & Museum Church of San Miguel Arc√°ngel, Guaro The parish church of San Miguel Arc√°ngel is one of the most important monuments in Guaro. This temple is located in the center of the old town a few meters from the Town Hall and the San Isidro Labrador Fountain. It was built on an old mosque in 1505 and renovated up to two times. It has a Latin cross plan without the side naves, on the facade you will find the image of San Miguel and, on its right, the bell tower. Two other outstanding religious buildings are the hermitages of Cruz del Puerto and San Isidro, the latter located next to the Rio Grande in a place of eucalyptus. From the Cruz del Puerto hermitage, the panoramic views of the surroundings are exceptional, and inside you will find one of the most revered images by the neighbors, the Cristo de Limpias. Al-Andalus Cultural Center and its Ethnographic Oil Museum, which houses an Arab oil press from the 12th century. The objective of this space is to highlight the value of the municipality as a traditional olive producer since the Al-Andalus period. Also on the same theme, the Marmolejo Oil Museum has a collection of tools and machinery from the old Guaro mills. Events The town of Guaro holds a very special event every year: the Luna Mora Festival. Over two days, the town's streets are lit up with over 25,000 candles and Arabic and Andalusian music as the backdrop. The Luna Mora Festival in Guaro also includes a full programme of activities: workshops, exhibitions, story telling for the kids, bazaars and food markets. There is also a series of concerts held in the Luna Mora Auditorium. All under the light of the candles that take visitors into the Andalusian past of the town, creating a magical atmosphere. Gastronomy The gastronomy of the town is solid and varied. The typical dish is ‚Äúponcima‚Äù soup (made with tomatoes, peppers and potatoes), almond soup, the boiled soup and the goat from the sierra with thyme. In addition, in Guaro's homes you will always find gazpachuelo and galipuche (a stew whose main ingredients are asparagus, eggs, peppers, potatoes and bread). Almond-based sweets are very popular as this being the main crop of the municipality.

Discovered by Pelageya Shajn at Simeiz in 1928, it was named after American astronomer Annie Jump Cannon.  Discovery  Cannonia was discovered on 11 September 1928, by Russian astronomer Pelageya Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. Two days later, it was independently discovered by Grigory Neujmin (also at Simeiz), and ten days later by Eug√®ne Delporte at Uccle Observatory in Belgium. The independent discoveries, however, are not officially acknowledged by the Minor Planet Center.  Orbit and classification  Cannonia is a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,205 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins unusually late at Uccle in January 1946, or nearly 18 years after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  Cannonia is an assumed stony S-type asteroid, according to its family membership. = Rotation period = In November 2004, a rotational lightcurve of Cannonia was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer John Menke at his Menke Observatory in Barnesville, Maryland. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 3.816 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.16 magnitude (). An anonymously submitted lightcurve gave a similar period of hours (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Cannonia measures between 8.1 and 10.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.129 and 0.49. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of the Flora family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 10.8 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.0.  Naming  This minor planet was named after American astronomer Annie Jump Cannon (1863‚Äì1941), who developed a taxonomic system of stellar spectral types at Harvard University, and subsequently classified about 225,000 stars with these types for the Henry Draper Catalog. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). She is also honored by the lunar crater Cannon.

Today, they manufacture process equipment for the plastics industry, and employ roughly 100 people. History Farrel Pomini, Ansonia CT Farrel was founded in 1848 as a foundry by Almon Farrel. During the American Civil War, they produced bayonets and cannon barrels. In 1927, Farrel Foundry merged with Birmingham Iron Foundry of Derby, Connecticut. During the 1920s, Farrel-Birmingham began creating gears for use in US Navy propulsion systems in Buffalo, New York. In 1941, the Navy contracted with Farrel-Birmingham and General Motors to begin manufacturing a rapid reversal gear system that would allow vessels to reverse engines without first slowing down. In 1942, Farrel- Birmingham received the E award from the Navy for their efforts. In 1963, Farrel Birmingham adopted the current name of Farrel Corporation and began manufacturing process equipment for plastic plants. During the 1970s and 1980s, Farrel went through several owners. In 1986, a group of private equity investors including Rolf Liebergesell, Charles S. Jones and Alberto Shaio, acquired the company from Emhart Corporation (which later merged with Black & Decker) for $1.0 million plus assumption of debt. At the CEO‚Äôs direction, Charles S. Jones‚Äôs firm divested the Roll Grinder products division, the Railroad products division, the steel extrusion division, and a 25% equity stake in the Italian Pomini enterprise. The Railroad products division was acquired by Simmons Machine Tool Corporation in Albany, New York. Then, Farrel, under Liebergesell‚Äôs direction, focused exclusively on its core operations of plastic and rubber equipment. By 1991, under the leadership of Al Shaio, head of sales, revenue doubled to $105 million, with $5.4 million in operating income. In 1992, Charles S. Jones led Farrel‚Äôs IPO on NASDAQ, underwritten by Paine Webber and First Albany for a pre-money valuation of $52.1 million, giving the original investors a 52.1x return in less than six years, with an IRR of 92.1%. Following the acquisition, Charles S. Jones led the acquisition of Farrel‚Äôs major competitors, including Rockstedt OHG in Germany, Francis Shaw Rubber Machinery Ltd. and PRC Fabrications Ltd in the United Kingdom and Skinner Engine in Erie, Pennsylvania. In 2009, Farrel was acquired by the HF Machinery Group division of L. Possehl & Co., of L√ºbeck, Germany. In 2016, Farrel built a new facility in Ansonia.

He represented the Fiji national cricket team.Cricinfo profile He also held government office in Fiji for many years, serving as Attorney-General from 1889 to 1899. He later served as Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands (1900 - 1911).  Early life and education  Educated initially at Bromsgrove School, where he became an accomplished cricketer, Udal went on to train as a barrister at Queen's College, Oxford. He was called to the bar at London's Inner Temple in November 1875, and went on to practice Law on the Western Circuit before becoming Attorney General of Fiji in September 1889. He also became Admiralty Advocate of Fiji. Legal career Udal served as Attorney General of Fiji from 1889 to 1899, and as Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands from 1900 to 1911. While serving as Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands, Udal successfully sued James Townsland Allen, editor of the Montserrat Herald, for libel. On 1 November 1910, Allen was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment after a jury found him guilty on two counts of \\"wickedly and maliciously contriv[ing] and intend[ing] to scandalise and vilify the said John Symonds Udal in his office of Chief Justice of the said Colony, and to cause it to be believed that the said John Symonds Udal was not a fit and proper person to administer justice in his said office.\\" In particular, the jury condemned Allen for these words: \\"We as laymen certainly disapprove of His Honour's conduct which to say the least of it was not only ungracious and undignified, but savoured very much of mean cowardice, calculated to bring the administration of justice into contempt.\\" Interests A fascination with antiquities, one of Udal's many hobbies, led to an in-depth study of Dorset folklore, customs, and traditions. He was made a member of the Council of the Folklore Society in 1889, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1901. His extensive research into Dorset folklore culminated in his work, Dorsetshire Folklore in 1922. During his time as Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands, Udal was shown a memorial on Nevis to John Pinney, son of Azariah Pinney, formerly of Bettiscombe. This led Udal to believe that the well-known Bettiscombe Skull was that of one of Pinney's slaves. Finding a reference in an old register of slaves on the Pinney estate to \\"Bettiscombe\\", he concluded that the skull belonged to a slave named Bettiscombe, who must have been brought to England when or before the Nevis estates were sold. This theory, which Udal published in the Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries, was disproved long after Udal's death. Sporting career A right-handed batsman and bowler, John Udal played minor cricket for Dorset, Somerset and the Free Foresters.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1926, Obituaries He made his first-class debut for the MCC against Sussex in July 1871.First-class matches played by John Udal at CricketArchive He played a match against \\"Surrey Club\\" in July 1873 which was evidently enough to persuade WG Grace to invite him on a tour to Australia, though he was unable to go. He played one final first-class match for the MCC, against Cambridge University in June 1875. In 1895, whilst Attorney-General of Fiji, he captained the Fiji national cricket team on a tour of New Zealand. He played six further first-class matches on the tour, during which he scored his only first-class half-century against Wellington.First-class batting against each opponent for John Udal at Cricket Archive He did much to encourage the game in Fiji, doing the same whilst serving as Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands. He later returned to England. Family Udal was the second son, and the fourth of nine children born to William Udal and Mary-Anne Symonds, who were cousins. William (born 1802) hailed from Netherbury, where his family had lived for generations. Mary-Anne (born 1817) was from Broadwindsor. William and Mary-Anne then moved to Edgbaston, Birmingham, Staffordshire, where William became a successful businessman. On 8 August 1878, John Udal married Eva Mary Adelina Routh, with whom he had two sons (Arthur Uvedale and Robin Nicholas) and three daughters (Evelyn Routh, Eva Beatrice, and Ida Vita Isabel). Udal left something of a cricketing dynasty.

It was discovered on 11 September 1928, by Soviet astronomer Pelageya Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The presumed S-type asteroid has rotation period of 13.2 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named for Natasha Tichomirova, daughter of astronomer Grigory Neujmin.  Orbit and classification  Natascha is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. Conversely, the asteroid is also considered a core member of the disputed Astraea family. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,484 days; semi-major axis of 2.55 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Simeiz Observatory in March 1918. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg Observatory in February 1930, or 17 months after its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Naming  This minor planet was named as a birthday present for Soviet hydrogeologist Natasha (Natalia) Tichomirova, daughter of Grigory Neujmin, who was an astronomer at the discovering Simeiz Observatory and prolific discoverer of minor planets himself (). The author of the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz Schmadel, learned about the naming circumstances from Crimean astronomers N. Solovaya, Nataliya Sergeevna Samoilova-Yakhontova and Nikolai Chernykh (also see and ).  Physical characteristics  Natascha is an assumed, stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period and poles = In May 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Natascha was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Oakley Southern Sky Observatory in Australia. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 13.197 hours with a brightness variation of 0.51 magnitude (). A high brightness amplitude typically indicates a non-spherical shape. In 2016, a modeled lightcurve was published using photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database. Lightcurve inversion gave a concurring period of hours, as well as two spin axes of (16.0¬∞, 59.0¬∞) and (209.0¬∞, 50.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Natascha measures between 12.859 and 14.52 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.160 and 0.294. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 14.89 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.5.

Muncil (28 Aug 1867 - 16 Dec 1930) was an American master builder in the Adirondacks early in the 20th century. He was a major figure in the architectural development of the Adirondack Great Camps; among his many projects was Marjorie Merriweather Post's Camp Topridge, Northbrook Lodge, and White Pine Camp, a summer White House of US President Calvin Coolidge. Born in Vermontville, New York, he started life as a lumberman at age 14 and as a guide and camp caretaker on Upper St. Regis Lake at age 18. He was the first to use \\"brainstorm siding,\\" wavy-edged cladding, in place of clapboard, at several camps, including White Pine Camp on Osgood Pond in 1907. Other projects included Camp Longwood and the Huntington camp, both on Spitfire Lake, and the Little Camp on Upper St. Regis Lake. The main boathouse at Topridge, with its curving cedar railings and twig work screens, is one of the major and last examples of the naturalistic rustic tradition introduced by W. W. Durant.

It was founded in 1956 in Miami Beach, Florida by Stuart and Clifford S. Perlman when they purchased Lum's hot dog stand for $10,000. Over the next few years, the Perlman brothers opened three additional Lum's restaurants, for a total of four by 1961. Clifford Perlman, in addition to owning Lum's, had been serving as the president of Southern Wood Industries, Inc., resigned that position to work full-time for Lum's. Under the brothers, Lum's began aggressively expanding and franchising; the signature item was hot dogs steamed in beer. In 1969, Lum's, Inc. was admitted to the New York Stock Exchange. Lum's, Inc. purchased Caesars Palace for $60 million in 1969. At that time, Caesars was a 500-room hotel-casino on the Las Vegas strip. The food operations of Lum's, Inc. were sold in 1971 to John Y. Brown, then chairman of Kentucky Fried Chicken along with a group of investors. At the time of sale, the company owned and franchised 400 stores in the continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Europe. In 1978, Wienerwald Holdings, A.G., a Swiss holding company and parent of the Wienerwald restaurant chain, under the direction of Friedrich Jahn, purchased the 273 restaurant chain from Brown. Wienerwald had overextended itself and was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1982. Two Jahn-controlled Lum's franchises were also forced to close all of their 70 Lum's locations and file for bankruptcy. The original Lum's location closed in 1983. For a time, there was only one Lum's operating, in Bellevue, Nebraska. In 2010 a Lum's opened in Seekonk, Massachusetts, but later closed, leaving the Nebraska restaurant as the sole location. The Bellevue location closed on May 28, 2017. The Miami Beach location was still open around 1998. For a time in the 1970s, the company's commercial spokesman was Milton Berle.

To enhance their natural abilities, they each wear a Hard Suit - each of them specialized in its equipment and performance according to the respective wearer's field combat role. They were recruited by Sylia Stingray to battle the corrupt Genom corporation that dominates their home city of Mega Tokyo and which was responsible for her father's death. In order to finance their activities, the Knight Sabers also accept paying jobs as bodyguards or mercenaries. Their main activity is fighting out-of-control boomers, half biological/half-mechanical robots built by Genom. =Sylia Stingray= Sylia Stingray (spelled Silia in Bubblegum Crisis) is the 22-year-old ringleader of the Knight Sabers. Very calm and cool-headed, she does not show much emotion. She is the daughter of Dr. Katsuhito Stingray, the man who originally created the boomers. He was murdered by Genom executive Brian J. Mason, and his death was covered up as an accident, but an unknown individual managed to send Sylia a data unit, providing her with Genom's future plans and the technological means of creating the Knight Sabers' hardsuits. She wears a blue and silver Hard Suit equipped with retractable sword blades in the forearms, laser cannons in the palms and wings for full flight capability. Professionally, Sylia is a wealthy businesswoman whose business ventures, aside from the mercenaries' fee, finance the team. Her primary business is the lingerie shop \\"Silky Doll\\" she personally runs, housed in her private building, Lady's 633, on whose top is also her penthouse apartment functioning as the Knight Sabers' base of operations. Her civilian vehicle is a red Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing coupe. In the Bubblegum Crash sequel series, she refurnishes her business into a high-class fashion boutique. Several questions about Sylia and her origins are raised in the series, but, due to the incompletion of the OVA series, never conclusively answered. In the spin-off comic Bubblegum Crisis: Grand Mal and the 2040 series, it is suggested that Sylia's brain was augmented by her father with Boomer-related technology, making her a human/Boomer hybrid. In the 2040 series, Sylia takes a less active role, only suiting up occasionally for particular tough enemies, or for personal vendettas. It is also revealed in the 2040 series that the Knight Sabers are the 2nd team she has led. The first team used more conventional hardsuits and were killed in combat. Unlike the original series, in the 2040 story Sylia finances the team completely, and pays the other women double combat pay for tougher enemies. Also, unlike her stoic original self, Sylia is more flirtatious and playful on the surface, but prone to violent mood-swings when not in public. Sylia is voiced by Yoshiko Sakakibara in Japanese and Jemila Ericson in English in the original series, and Satsuki Yukino and Laura Chapman in the 2040 series. =Priss Asagiri= Priscilla S. Asagiri is the moody and defiant 19-year-old member of the Knight Sabers, fighting boomers with ferocious abandon in her slick dark blue Hard Suit, which features a railgun in the right hand as well as a laser gun in the original series and her signature knuckle bombers (explosive charges in both hands of her hard suit) in both series; in the Bubblegum Crash series the suit becomes a modular core system to which a variety of selective heavy weapons can be attached. In the Crisis series, her Hard Suit also combines with her Motoslave (a motorcycle that transforms into an automated mecha or an exosuit) to combat more-advanced Boomers. In Crisis, Crash, and the 2040 series, Priss is a rock singer besides being a motorcyclist; her rock band's name, \\"Priss and the Replicants\\", is a direct reference to Blade Runner. She shares a budding friendship with AD Policeman Leon McNichol. She is an orphan of the 2025 Kant≈ç earthquake, who joined a biker gang. After her boyfriend was killed and his death declared insignificant by the police (giving her a dislike for the law enforcement), she attempted to hunt down the killers, but she was recruited into the Sabers instead. Her next relationship was with Sylvie, a biker girl who actually was a runaway 33-S sexaroid, and also ended in tragedy. Priss' rebellious streak is tempered by a good heart and sense of humor, which may explain her ability to function in Sylia Stingray's demanding and disciplined operation. She essentially serves as the hammer of the outfit‚Äîas opposed to Sylia's leadership and genius, Nene's tech wizardry, and Linna's sleek athletic precision. Priss was voiced by rock singer Kinuko Ohmori in Bubblegum Crisis, but after the series was cancelled, she decided to focus full-time on her recording career, and thus J-pop singer Ryoko Tachikawa took over the role in Bubblegum Crash. In English, she is voiced by Sinda Nichols normally while the English singing voice is done by Joyce Leigh Bowden in the original series, with Yuu Asakawa and Christine Auten in the 2040 series. =Linna Yamazaki= Linna Yamazaki is a 20-year-old member of the Knight Sabers and dons a green Hard Suit equipped with \\"ribbon cutters\\" - long, electrically-charged nanomolecular ropes mounted behind the helmet that can be used to slash through Boomers and other high-tech opponents. She is also armed with explosive \\"knuckle bombers\\" - explosive charges in the right hand of her hard suit that could deliver devastating blows, as well as a finger-mounted triplet laser gun. In Bubblegum Crash, the knuckle bombers and lasers are replaced with electrically charged twin wire-daggers. Working as an aerobics instructor, Linna once hoped to pursue a career in professional dancing, but her efforts in the trials went unappreciated by all but Sylia, who recruited her into her team. Eventually, her constant greed for money makes her switch to stockbroker consulting in Bubblegum Crash. Linna is perhaps the most socially conventional of the Sabers, and as such, lacks a distinct personality. But she is an excellent team player, and the stories linking episode 2 with episode 7 (Irene's death and Vision's peace) would be inconceivable without Linna's heartfelt warmth and decency. There is a comic side to her, especially in tandem with the foibles of Nene. Linna is voiced by Michie Tomizawa in Japanese and Elizabeth Becka in English in the original series, with Rio Natsuki and Kelly Manison in the 2040 series. Linna's character is significantly more fleshed-out in the 2040 series. She is the 20-year-old daughter of an old fashioned country couple, but took work in Tokyo to get away from her demanding father. At her desk job as a clerk in Tokyo she has to deal with managers who try to abuse their positions to the point of sexual harassment. She also must directly work under female boomer robots used as middle managers that do not allow mistakes or free time while at work. She is not a member of the Knight Sabers at the beginning of the 2040 series, and actively tracks down Priss demanding a place with them. Later episodes continue with to show that she is highly driven to be the best Knight Saber of the group and help as many people as possible. She even openly admits to Priss that her goal is to be better than her. =Nene Romanova= Nene Romanova is an 18-year-old member of the Knight Sabers, acting as a technical conductor and hacker, and is an employee of the AD Police, functioning as the Knight Saber's mole in the ADP world. She is bubbly, naive, has an affinity for candy and junk food, and is blissfully inept with real world logic. Due to her lack of (and unwillingness to engage in) regular exercise, she is often teased by Priss and Linna for not being more physically durable. Nene's blue and pink Hard Suit's offensive weapon is a weak laser gun unsuited for taking out enemies; instead, it is used to scribble the Knight Sabers' signature onto their scene of actions. She relies on her suit's computer and electronic warfare systems to stay away from an enemy. In episode 8 of Crisis, Nene receives an upgraded red and pink colored suit. She gets another new suit in Crash. Her suit's offensive capabilities are stocked up considerably with an electromagnetic pulse striker and the capability of physically hacking into a Boomer's computer brain. Nene is voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu in Japanese and Susan Grillo in English, with Hiroko Konishi and Hilary Haag in the 2040 series. =Mackie Stingray= is Sylia's younger brother and her only family. He serves as the Knight Sabers' backup and mechanic along with Sylia's friend, Dr. Raven. Mackie is a whiz kid with computers and technology. He has to constantly make repairs to Priss's bike because of her driving and the situations she gets into. He can pilot an armored suit himself and drives a large truck that delivers the Knight Sabers and their bikes to a situation. Mackie's character is also extremely perverted, trying to catch his sister (as well as the other Knight Sabers) in the nude as much as he can. Mackie is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki in Japanese and Frank Trimble in English in the original series. In the 2040 storyline Mackie is much more polite. His sister Sylia tries to keep Mackie from becoming involved, but he helps the former Genom employee named Nigel at his rundown motorcycle shop and builds and repairs the team's Hardsuits. It is later revealed that Mackie is actually a prototype Boomer that has a more advanced brain modeled after Sylia's own brain functions. In both versions, Mackie also shows romantic feelings towards Nene Romanova. =Fargo= is an informant. His background is unknown, but his information includes data from the government, Genom, and the various criminal syndicates and underworlds, so he has a lot of connections. He has found the Knight Sabers a few Genom-related contracts, and Sylia trusts him to the point that he knows her true identity. He even has the audacity to ask Sylia into dangerous parts of Megatokyo after dark for meetings, and is constantly pursuing her as a sexual conquest. Sylia, however, does not have any interest in this and makes it very obvious. Fargo is voiced by K≈çichi Yamadera and by Geoffery Honaker in English. =Nigel Kirkland= In the 2040 series Nigel is a former Genom employee who worked as an assistant to Sylia's father in his work on prototype Boomers. He now owns his own motorcycle repair shop, but still uses his skills to help Sylia by building custom hardsuits for her and her team of Knight Sabers. He is also a target of romantic feelings from both Priss and Sylia. He also befriends Mackie and lets him help out, and even move in with him. =Meisio= Meisio is a character from the 2040 series. He is the faithful elderly butler of the Stingray family and Sylia's former guardian who is constantly worrying about his mistress' welfare (both physically and mentally) during the Knight Sabers' operations, thus playing the role of a sort-of voice of reason for Sylia. GENOM Corporation In the Bubblegum Crisis universe, the GENOM Corporation is the primary manufacturer and distributor of the bio-organic constructs known as \\"Boomers\\". This makes GENOM the primary enemy of the Knight Sabers - led by Sylia Stingray, daughter of the man who created the Boomers. In both versions of the series, GENOM is run by a mysterious figure named Quincy, though the depiction of Quincy varies from one continuity to another (in the original series he was a dangerous, hands-on owner, while in Tokyo 2040 he is almost a puppet vegetable of a man, so old and decrepit he needs tubes and wires to keep himself alive while insanely dreaming of a boomer/human paradise). Brian J. Mason also works for GENOM, and his schemes are either offshoots of or interference to Quincy's. To show the power and domination of GENOM, the viewer is shown the gargantuan GENOM Towers, which stand in many of that world's most important cities. These towers bear a resemblance to the Tower of Babel, both in appearance and in symbolism, as well as the Tyrell Corporation's tower in Blade Runner. =Brian J. Mason/Largo= Brian J. Mason is the primary villain of the first three episodes, a high-level executive in the GENOM corporation who killed Dr. Stingray and stole his Boomer technology. As with Sylia, certain mysteries are created around Mason which are never resolved in the series. It is generally accepted that Mason somehow transferred his personality into a boomer body some time prior to his death in episode 3, resurfacing in episodes 5 and 6 under the identity of Largo. Most likely, he succeeded in transferring his memories into the ultimate Boomer, thus creating a God-like being able to vaporize three major GENOM branch towers in a single instant at will using a mental link with the USSD's particle-beam satellites. Despite being killed by the combined efforts of the Knight Sabers in episode 6 of Crisis, Largo resurfaces to become the primary villain in the Crash sequel. Mason was voiced by Shuuichi Ikeda in Japanese and by Eric Paisley in English, while his Largo persona was voiced by Kazuyuki Sogabe and Pierre Brulatour in the Japanese and English versions respectively. In a scene from Blade Runner, the word Largo appears singularly on a prominently displayed piece of sheet music. =Quincy= The Chief Executive and founder of GENOM, Quincy is an enigmatic old man who hides many secrets under the face of an unfazeable and ruthless businessman. His company participates in the manufacture of many necessities around the world, but in fact Quincy wants to seize total economic and political domination of the world. While he makes several appearances in the series, he is never truly met personally. He is killed twice, only to be revealed each time as an android double. It is speculated by fans that he may have downloaded his personality into GENOM's main database; several clues to this are offered in the AD Police manga series. Quincy is voiced by Kiyoshi Kawakubo in Japanese and David Arnold in English. In the 2040 series, Quincy bears the family name Rosenkroitz, and being confined to a life support system, is far less active than his Artmic version. He is not shown as a thoroughly evil person, more like a whimsical, childlike mind thinking of Boomers as friends to mankind. =Boomers= Boomers are synthetic life forms produced by the GENOM Corporation. They are developed specifically for specific jobs, such as acting as maids, waiters, bodyguards, store mannequins, and military weapons. Some (very advanced and expensive models) have gained sentience and developed minds of their own, but most are simply machines. Boomers designed for infiltration and combat are capable of appearing human, whether male or female, but tend to \\"burst\\" out of their synthetic skin in combat situations, revealing their true selves: large, metallic killing machines armed with built-in weapons such as lasers, machine guns, and arm blades capable of cleaving through a fire hydrant. These \\"Military Combat Boomers\\", or simply Combat Boomers, are sometimes also referred to as \\"light mobile armored combat machines\\" (the latter possibly a common generic designation for autonomous military robots of a certain size). Such boomers are generally classified as C-Class Boomers. Sylvie Sylvie is a female character who appears on episode 5 \\"Moonlight Rambler\\". She and her friends Meg, Lou, Nam and Anri try to escape from space station Genaros in a stolen shuttle, but only Sylvie and Anri make it; and eventually they crash-land near Megatokyo. Upon reaching the metropolis, Sylvie befriends Priss without revealing her origin. It is revealed that she is a Sexaroid (a Boomer designed to be a love-doll) model 33-S designed to feed on human blood as if she is a vampire and pilot \\"D.D.\\", a heavily armed mecha with a fail-safe mechanism that can be set to self-destruct with a nuclear reactor if the power runs out. Priss is left no choice but to kill Sylvie to deactivate the D.D.'s self- destruct mechanism. Sylvie is voiced by Yoshino Takamori in Japanese and Martha Ellen Senseney in English. Anri Anri is a Sexaroid who fled with Sylvie from the space station Genaros to Earth. During their escape, Anri was badly wounded, which forced Sylvie to kill people around Megatokyo for their blood to keep Anri alive. In episode 6 \\"Red Eyes\\", she is hired by Largo as his assistant. During a confrontation between Largo and Priss, Anri stabs Priss when Largo tells her the truth about Sylvie's death; to which Priss explains her reason and asks Anri for forgiveness. Anri is then killed when she blocks an energy blast fired by Largo toward Priss, but Anri forgives her before she dies, while Largo mocks her sacrifice. Anri is voiced by Yuko Mizutani in Japanese and by Katherine Burton in English. AD Police =Leon McNichol= An AD Police officer, Leon McNichol is a dedicated cop with a tendency to rush in without thinking. He is a skilled powered armor pilot, one of the AD Police force's aces in its K-11 and K-12S powered suits. Leon has a crush on Priss, which she does not like since she has reasons to despise the AD Police. As the series progresses, he discovers that she is a Knight Saber but continues to help the team as best as he can. Priss and Leon's relationship grows closer during the series, and in a side story audio drama, written by series author Toshimichi Suzuki, she confesses that she loves him, though this is not referenced in the sequel Bubblegum Crash. In the 2040 series, Leon is more burly than his Artmic version, and initially more antagonistic towards the Knight Sabers because in his eyes they are soiling the honor of the AD Police by eliminating maddened Boomers before they can. However, in time he begins to change his mind, especially since he and Priss begin to take a liking to each other. Leon also appears in the AD Police manga and anime series, where he is yet a rookie officer. Leon is voiced by Toshio Furukawa in Japanese and Brad Moranz in English. =Daley Wong= Daley Wong is Leon's partner, and a highly skilled investigator. He is also openly homosexual, which is worth noting because at the time the original OVA was produced male homosexual characters were quite rare in anime. Also notable is the ease and comfort of Daley and Leon's working relationship: Daley flirts openly with the heterosexual Leon whenever Leon's temper tends to get the better of him, and Leon often reciprocates with good humor. Daley is not developed much in the series. He is, however, portrayed to be loyal and highly competent, both as Leon's underling and as a commander in his own right (in the first and final episodes he is shown commanding his own AD Police squad). Daley's sense of humor is very dry and understated; his 2040 version is more openly sarcastic, especially towards Leon. Daley is voiced by Kenyuu Horiuchi in Japanese and Marshall Carroll in English. =Naoko= Nene's colleague (as an ADP Operator) and best friend outside the Knight Sabers; the two share a common interest in popular music and looking for a boyfriend. She is voiced by Junko Asami in Japanese and by Belinda Bizic in English. =Chief Todo= The black Chief of the AD Police (his name could be a mispronunciation of Todd) is a bad-tempered man who has to put up both with official restrictions and rebellious underlings, Leon in particular. He was originally from Chicago, but moved to Japan after the Second Great Kanto earthquake that all but decimated Japan's infrastructure. Despite his grouchy personality, Todo cares for his men; he has gone so far as granting Leon the freedom he needs without his 'official' knowledge or approval on several occasions. He has a niece, Lisa, who plays a central role in episode eight \\"Scoop Chase\\". Todo is voiced by Masaharu Sat≈ç in Japanese and David Kraus in English. =Jeena Malso= Inspector Jeena Malso is the partner of a Leon McNichol featured in the A.D. Police Files series. A slightly rough and tumble woman, Jeena possesses a cybernetic arm and a deep hatred of the Boomers she and the rest of the AD Police battle. Other characters =Irene Chang= Appearing in episode 2 \\"Born to Kill\\", Irene Chang is a young woman who goes to the same fitness club where Linna teaches an aerobics class. She's the younger sister of Reika Chang. She was engaged to an employee of the GENOM Corporation, but her fianc√© went missing, which led her in a quest to expose GENOM's secrets. Unfortunately, she is murdered by a female Boomer, which results in a retaliation by the Knight Sabers on the corporation. Although Linna avenges Irene's murder by killing the Boomer responsible, her death sets the chain of events in Episode 7 in motion. Irene is voiced by Miki It≈ç in Japanese and by Jean Hrdlicka. =J.B. Gibson= In episode 4 \\"Revenge Road\\", J.B. Gibson drives a heavily modified Griffon supercar. A few months earlier, Gibson and his girlfriend Naomi were assaulted on the road by a biker gang, which resulted in Naomi's mind locked in a catatonic state. In retaliation, Gibson modified his Griffon with only one goal: to destroy the biker gang responsible. However, his crusade backfires when the car develops a mind of its own after having been equipped with a device that interfaces with his brainwaves. During a high-speed chase, the Knight Sabers successfully extract Gibson and Naomi out of the speeding Griffon before AD Police dispose of the vehicle. They are both mentioned by Sylia to have been arrested by the police and their fates are not shown afterwards. Gibson is voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa in Japanese and Zach Hanner in English. =Reika Chang/Vision= In episode 7 \\"Double Vision\\", Reika Chang is a Chinese-American singer who performs under the name Vision. She travels to Megatokyo to start her world tour, but her music career is merely a facade. She is the elder sister of Irene Chang, who was murdered by the GENOM Corporation in Episode 2. Moreover, she is an heiress to the \\"Hou Bang\\", a powerful Chinese clan bent on destroying GENOM and the American firm Gulf & Bradley - both of whom are collaborating on a Super Boomer project. Linna eventually manages to help Reika abandon her path of revenge and convinces her to continue her singing career. Reika was intended to replace Priss in the series when a dispute with Kinuko Oomori's recording contract arose and the character was originally to be killed, but an outcry from fans convinced the producers otherwise and reversed this decision. This is alluded to further in Episode 8, when Reika makes a cameo appearance at the drive-in theater where Sylia is meeting with Fargo. She appears in the movie playing behind them on-screen, wearing a dark blue hardsuit similar to the Knight Sabers, but without a helmet. Reika is voiced by Maiko Hashimoto in the Japanese version. She is also her character's singing voice. In the English version, she is voiced by Mindi Lyons for her normal voice while the singing voice is provided by Cyndi Wheeler. =Lisa Vanette= Appearing in episode 8 \\"Scoop Chase\\", Lisa Vanette is the niece of AD Police Chief Todo and an aspiring photojournalist who sets her sights on exposing the Knight Sabers when she photographs a fight between them and a renegade Boomer and Priss smashes her camera to prevent her from capturing their activities on film. Like her uncle, Lisa is of black ethnicity. Nene is assigned to accompany Lisa around the city. One night, after a fight between the Knight Sabers and a Boomer, Lisa discovers in one of her photos that Nene is one of them after her helmet is damaged in battle. But after coming to appreciate the work the Knight Sabers do, she eventually turns the photo and its digital negative over to Nene. Lisa is voiced by Aya Hisakawa in Japanese and Amy Parrish in English.

Early life The grave of James Faed, Dean Cemetery James was the second son of the six children of James Faed, tenant of Barlay Mill, near Gatehouse of Fleet, Galloway, and Mary n√©e McGeoch. Two of his brothers, John and Thomas and his son James Faed, Jnr. also became artists. In his early years his father thought James had a marked talent for engineering. When he was sixteen he built a dinghy in one of the outhouses at Barlay Mill, taking him a year. At seventeen he went to Maryport with his father and brother John. While John was painting miniatures, James did the same work as his father's men. Painter However, with his father's death in 1842 and his work at Barlay Mill virtually at an end, in 1846 James joined his two brothers, John and Thomas, who were living at 6 South West Circus Place in Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1849 James began to paint fine landscapes, miniatures, and portraits in oils and watercolours and became a regular exhibitor at the Royal Scottish Academy for twenty years. His watercolour Coast Scene on the Colvend Coast is in the Aberdeen Art Gallery. Two of his miniatures, Isabella Lockhart Robertson and Miss Mary Duncan (both now in private hands) are particularly fine. By 1850 James and Thomas had moved out of Circus Place and obtained a house together at 16 Comely Bank.Edinburgh Post office Directory 1850 Mezzotinter Introduced to the mezzotint engraver, John Bonnar, James became interested in a more rapid process for preparing the plate for the engraver - possibly the engineering streak in him his father noticed. He also developed an intense interest in mezzotinting and soon began his career in that art and as an engraver in general. As a mezzotinter, for over fifty years, he was possibly only excelled in his day by Samuel Cousins (1801‚Äì1887). Several of Faed's mezzotints were commissioned by the Royal Association for the Promotion of Fine Arts in Scotland. Engraver About 1871 James went to Australia in order to visit his brother William, who had emigrated, and stayed at Stony Park, Brunswick, the home of Theodotus John Sumner. When that house was later destroyed by fire, a record discovered mentioned that many engravings of cottage life, and proofs, by James Faed, were lost in the fire, but that some which survived were hung in the dining room of the rebuilt house. His engravings of portraits became widely in demand and his first patron was John Watson Gordon who in 1850 became President of the Royal Scottish Academy and Her Majesty's Limner for Scotland. Faed engraved at least one hundred and thirty three plates, one of which was a Royal Commission for the painting of Queen Victoria and Prince Arthur, by Winterhalter, and his last commission was a portrait of the Countess of Seafield which was hung in the Royal Academy in 1877. The last engraving James Faed undertook, at the age of eighty, was a portrait of the Earl of Home, father of the future Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. It was exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1899 and James received ¬£159/10/- for the commission. Death He died suddenly while eating his lunch at 7 Barnton Terrace, Edinburgh, in his ninety-first year. His wife Mary Cotton had died in 1887 at the age of sixty. They are buried with their sons, Dr Stewart Faed (1869-1898) and Francis Grant Faed (1867-1914) in Dean Cemetery. The grave lies under the trees at the west end of the north-west section.

The HSTF had three objectives: \\"to save for the future, to strengthen or diversify the economy, and to improve the quality of life of Albertans.\\" The HSTF operates under the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund Act and provides \\"prudent stewardship of the savings from Alberta's non- renewable resources by providing the greatest financial returns on those savings for current and future generations of Albertans.\\" The Heritage Savings Trust Fund used oil revenues to invest for the long term in such areas as health care, education and research and as a way of ensuring that the exploitation of non-renewable resources would be of long-term benefit to Alberta. As of 2012, the fund was invested in stocks, bonds, real estate and other ventures, with the aim of generating revenue for the province. Between 1980 and 2014, although non-renewable resource revenues (NRR) in Alberta generated almost $190 billion, the value of the Heritage Fund in 2014 was only $17.3 billion. After 1987, NRR was no longer added to the Heritage Fund. By 2009, after losing $3 billion in the markets, the value of the Heritage Fund had dropped to $14 billion, which was its value in 1985. The Alberta's Heritage Savings Trust Fund (HSTF) was worth $17.5 billion as of March 31, 2014 according to the Alberta government's 2013-2014 annual report. According to the 2018-19 annual report, the \\"fair value\\" of the Fund was $18.2 billion on March 31, 2019.2018‚Äì19 Annual Report History Initially, the fund received 30 per cent of Alberta's non-renewable resource royalties.theglobeandmail.com: \\"Alberta and Norway: Two oil powers, worlds apart\\", 15 Aug 2015 Over time, successive Conservative governments propped up dubious ventures in domestic sectors ranging from forestry to aviation and food processing. During the early 1980s, the fund made loans to other provincial governments in Canada. Later the fund's money was used for capital infrastructure projects. After 1987, Alberta's non-renewable resource revenues (NRR) were no longer added to the Heritage Fund. In 1983, $25.5 million from the AHSTF was used to build the Kananaskis Country Golf Course to diversify Alberta's economy while Premier Peter Lougheed was in office. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the view emerged that government \\"should not be in the business of business\\" and should not be so actively engaged in shaping the future. The Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund was shifted away from strategic business investments to become a savings tool investing for financial return. Investment into the fund was halted in 1987. Ralph Klein, who was Alberta Premier from 1992 through 2007, used the HSTF to fund special projects to encourage economic diversification. During the mid-1990s, public opinion turned against allowing governments to dip into the Heritage fund to fund special projects, and instead all income earned each year began to be withdrawn from the fund and added to general revenues. =Alberta Investment Management Corporation= The Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), a Crown corporation owned by the provincial government, is responsible for managing the assets of the HSTF. Prior to 2008, the assets of the fund was managed directly by the Alberta Ministry of Finance. =Council for Economic Strategy 2011= In its May 2011 report, entitled Shaping Alberta's Future, Premier Ed Stelmach's Council for Economic Strategy proposed the institution of a \\"Shaping the Future Fund to ensure that money produced by converting natural assets today is invested with intentionality to secure prosperity for future Albertans.\\" The flagship idea of the Council was, =Fiscal Management Act 2013= In 2013, the Fiscal Management Act \\"committed the government to saving a portion of its non-renewable resource revenues for the future.\\" Criticisms In their August 2015 contrast for The Globe and Mail between the AHSTF and the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, Brian Milner and Jeff Lewis wrote that Norway parks 100 per cent of its non- renewable resource (NRR) revenue from royalties and dividends in a fund that is barred from investing a krone in the domestic economy. Reports by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and the Fraser Institute concluded that Alberta should be saving more of its non-renewable resource revenues. Since 1980, the NRR in Alberta has generated almost $190 billion, but the value of the Heritage Fund was only $17.3 billion in 2014. After 1987, NRR was no longer added to the Heritage Fund. The Fraser Institute report compared the Alberta Heritage Fund to Norway and Alaska's NRR funds and argued that Alberta's was significantly \\"smaller than others because of its relative under-funding and chronic withdrawals of most income from the fund.\\" Alaska for example continued to deposit 25 percent of its NRR from 1982- 2011 and Norway contributed 100 percent. If Alberta had followed the Alaskan formula, by 2011 the Heritage Fund would have had $42.4 billion instead of $9.1 billion. By the Norway rules, Alberta would have had $121.9 billion by 2011. In 2013 Madelaine Drohan, author of the Canadian International Council report entitled The 9 Habits of Highly Effective Resource Economies: Lessons for Canada,and a Canadian correspondent for The Economist, echoed the IMF call for \\"stabilization funds\\" arguing that every province in Canada should consider establishing a sovereign wealth fund, as global peers have done, and treat non-renewable resource revenue (NRR) as \\"capital to be saved and invested, rather than income to be spent.\\" She added that in provinces like Alberta where the Fund already exists, it \\"should be implemented with a great deal more rigour.\\" Drohan warned in 2013 against the \\"political temptation\\" to \\"raid\\" the Fund and offered the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), a Crown corporation, the largest pension fund in Canada, as a model. By March 2015 the CPPIB fund had grown to $219-billion and made a 16.5-per- cent rate-of-return in 2013. In its annual report on the Canadian economy in February 2013, the Washington-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged Canada, and resource-rich provinces like Alberta and Quebec to \\"better manage boom-and-bust commodities cycles by stashing away more tax revenue in good times\\". IMF mission chief for Canada, Roberto Cardarelli, suggested that Norway, with the largest sovereign wealth fund, is an example Canada should follow. However, unlike Norway, resource royalties are collected at the provincial, not the federal level in Canada. Max Fawcett, the editor of Alberta Oil magazine, warned that the \\"new\\" Alberta Future Fund, \\"which would receive $200 million a year\\" that would \\"support big-picture projects\\" and the two \\"new innovation endowments\\" announced by Finance Minister Doug Horner in the 2014 budget, would be funded by raiding the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund. There were no new savings. According to Fumbling the Alberta Advantage, a Fraser Institute report written in 2015, \\"Between 2005/06 and 2013/14, and adjusted for inflation, the province of Alberta garnered $101.3 billion in resource revenues.\\" See also *Alberta Investment Management Corporation, the Crown corporation responsible for managing the Fund's investments *Government Pension Fund of Norway References Category:Government of Alberta Category:Economy of Alberta Category:1976 establishments in Alberta Category:Sovereign wealth funds Category:Energy in Alberta ","title":"Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund"},{"id":"13682992","text":"Norman Mashabane (26 June 1956 in Phalaborwa - 10 October 2007) was a former South African ambassador to Indonesia.

It is located at 265 Exchange Street South in the Irvine Park area, which was one of the first trendy neighborhoods in Minnesota. Designed by noted early Minnesota architect Monroe Sheire, the house is one of the nation's best-preserved Victorian homes, featuring carved walnut woodwork, marble fireplaces, crystal chandeliers, and many original furnishings. The Ramsey family began building the house in 1868, including innovations like hot water radiators, gas lights and hot and cold running water, and when it was completed in 1872, the total cost of construction was nearly $41,000. To furnish the house, Ramsey's wife Anna filled two boxcars with fashionable and expensive Renaissance-revival furniture from the A.T. Stewart Company Store in New York to bring home to Minnesota. The Ramseys' daughter Marion married Charles Furness in a lavish wedding in the parlor in 1875. The 15-room house remained in the Ramsey family until the death of Alexander Ramsey's last surviving granddaughter Anita in 1964. The house and its contents were left to the Minnesota Historical Society, which now operates it as a museum with tours offered year-round. They offer special programs such as \\"A Victorian Christmas at the Ramsey House\\" in which the house is decorated for the holidays and visitors can discover how the Ramseys would have prepared for and celebrated Christmas.

It opposes the current policy of Israel towards the Palestinian territories, particularly the territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and seeks a change in their political status. Its membership is primarily British Jews. Background The organisation was founded around 17 February 2002 by UK academic Irene Bruegel, the daughter of German-Jewish refugees, and her partner Richard Kuper, together with many, mainly female, Jewish friends, just after Bruegel had toured the West Bank. Within six years it achieved as membership of 1,300 out of a UK Jewish population of over a quarter of a million and over that period proved instrumental, according to an obituary, in 'shattering the illusion that all Jews unconditionally support the Israeli government.' It grew out of a reaction to the Al-Aqsa Intifada, which had rapidly led to the formation of a movement of British Jews opposed to Zionism who formed JPUK (Just Peace, United Kingdom) in October 2000. The deployment of the word 'Palestinian' in their name led to some controversy, but was retained. Bruegel's political skills quickly made it the largest organization of this type in its field. It played a significant role in the establishment of a broader organization, the European Jews for a Just Peace. It describes itself as welcoming all Jews, practising and secular Jews, Zionist and not, who oppose Israeli policies that could be seen as threatening Palestinian rights. It works through cultural events to bring about a public awareness critical of such policies. It supports a wide range of Israeli peace and human-rights groups working towards these same ends. One of its leaders, Richard Kuper, was active in forming a coalition of Jews who sailed in late 2010 from Cypus in an effort to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip, some months after the Gaza flotilla raid. Its stated reasons for supporting Palestinian rights are promoting human rights and that this is the best means of securing peace for Israelis. It supports the right of Israelis to live in freedom and security within Israel's 1967 borders. It organises to give voice to the many strands of Israeli peace activism and to ensure that Jewish opinions critical of Israeli policy are heard in Britain. It believes that such opposition is important in countering anti-semitism and the claim that opposition to Israel's policies is itself anti-semitic. David Hirsh quit the organisation in 2016 because some of its signatories questioned the good faith of those supporting allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party. It cooperates with other organisations on specific issues without necessarily endorsing them. Together with others, it calls on the British and European Union governments to suspend trade agreements with Israel, recognise the Palestinian Authority and support it financially, to cease to trade arms with Israel, push for the enforcement of international law in the region and strive for fair and free negotiations between the parties. It supports the British Shalom-Salaam Trust which funds a variety of humanitarian and educational projects in Israel and Palestine. It is a founder member of the Enough! Coalition in the UK in 2007. Open letters JfJfP has organised a number of petitions and open letters on political and human rights questions signed by distinguished British Jews from academia, the arts and other fields of activity.

Originally a German establishment called Viemeisters, the bar has been in continuous operation since 1892, making it one of the oldest bars in the New York City area. When it first opened, Viemeisters was a place that served only drinks, but during Prohibition, the bar was forced to change its name to Craig's Restaurant and start serving food in order to operate as a speakeasy. After the end of Prohibition and the closing of the nearby 18th Street Subway station in 1948, the bar began to fall into disrepair. It wasn't until the late 1960s, when local bar manager Larry Meagher took over operations, that the bar saw a resurgence of popularity. The Old Town Bar has managed to preserve a lot of its original fixtures which date back to the 19th century. The bar itself is 55 feet long and made of marble and mahogany. The ceiling, made of \\"tin\\" - actually pressed steelFletcher, Brekke (February 18, 2020) \\"The oldest, most iconic bars in New York City: Old Town Bar\\" CNN tiles, is 16 feet high. Other original furnishings include large beveled mirrors, antique cash registers, wooden booths, and New York's oldest dumbwaiter that ferries food orders from the upstairs kitchen down to the bar. Another notable feature is the row of old-style full-length urinals in the first floor Men's room, dating back to 1910. A creaky wooden staircase (also original) leads to an upstairs dining area, which was closed for several years before being reopened in the 1970s to cater to an unexpected increase in patrons coming to the bar on their lunch break. Several artists and Hollywood directors have used the Old Town as a backdrop for their productions and movie scenes, including rap group House of Pain for a music video for their 1992 single \\"Jump Around\\", and director Whit Stillman for his 1998 feature film The Last Days of Disco. It also appeared in the films The Devil's Own (1997), State of Grace (1990), Q & A (1990), Bullets over Broadway (1994), and Madonna's 1993 \\"Bad Girl\\" video.

Sumitomo Corporation assumed full ownership following Apex Silver's 2009 bankruptcy filing. Labor conditions A miner works 12-hour shifts from 7 in the morning to 7 at night. Locals alternate working for two weeks with one week of leave. Most of the workers are from local towns in the AltiPlano including San Cristobal, and Culpina K. Controversy The San Cristobal mine faces some controversy with the Bolivian government due to Bolivian President Evo Morales's desire to nationalize, at least in all but name, the mining industry in Bolivia. Previously the oil and natural gas industry was nationalized and Bolivian troops seized the fields; initially the nationalization took shape in the form of increased taxes for profits in this industry - from 50% to 83%. There has been great fear that next would be the mining industry. However, on May 1, 2007 President Morales signed Presidential Decree 29117Presidential Decree 29117 (Decreto Supremo No. 29117) (in Spanish) that assured all mining concessions existing at the time of the Decree will be respected and will remain in effect. This is the most significant step since the May 10, 2006 ruling by the Bolivian Supreme Court which declared the Mining Code to be unconstitutional. The court's ruling is not effective until May 2008 and the court urged the Bolivian Congress to enact legislation during that time which may supersede the ruling. Under the Mining Code, all mineral deposits in Bolivia are the property of the State. Mining concessions awarded by the State grant the holder, subject to certain payments, the exclusive right to carry out prospecting, exploration, exploitation, concentration, smelting, refining and marketing activities with respect to all mineral substances located within a given concession. Under Bolivian law, local and foreign companies are treated equally in obtaining mineral concessions. The court determined that the natural resources of Bolivia are owned by the public and the public must maintain ownership in part of these resources regardless of concessions made to foreign entities wishing to develop these resources. It ruled the State does not have the proper authority to give the aforementioned concessions to private companies wishing to engage in the mining of natural resources. In essence that is to say that a foreign company cannot own in full a mining operation in Bolivia without the State owning a part of it. The mining Decree by the President also designated all unclaimed mineral resources within the national territory as a Mining Fiscal Reserve to be administered by Bolivia's national mining company, COMIBOL. As indicated above, this portion of the decree does not interfere in any respect with any mining concession existing at the time of the decree, and in fact reinforces those privately held rights as inviolable.\\"Part III: Bolivia‚Äôs Mining Rollercoaster: Negotiating Nationalization\\" Written by Andean Information Network - Thursday, 16 August 2007 References External links *Website Minera San Christobal *Protests Mount Against San Cristobal Silver Mine - video report by Democracy Now!

The plot of the book was inspired by the work of American psychiatrist A.James Giannini, M.D, who used earlier books in Farmer's series as role-playing tools and aids to self- analysis. This technique was developed at Yale University and further expanded by Dr. Giannini at Ohio State University. The technique is properly called \\"projective psychotherapy\\". It involves immersing the patients in a fictional world which is accessible to the psychiatrist. It is subject to alternative interpretation but not to change. By utilizing a structured fantasy world the subconscious can be directly accessed without confronting resistances of the conscious mind. AJ Giannini. Use of fiction in therapy. Psychiatric Times. 18(7):56-57, 2001. This novel was written by Farmer in consultation with Dr. Giannini. It depicts a delusional adolescent boy who is treated with projective psychotherapy. In this case the works of fiction are the previously published novels in the \\"World of Tiers\\" series. Characters and locations are recursively introduced in the mind of the protagonist. He travels into the World of Tiers although it is never certain if he is delusional or has found a gateway to an alternative universe. The psychiatrist in the novel then analyzes this alternative reality rather than the world he shares with his patient. This delusion is prefabricated by Farmer and not subject to modification. In the \\"Afterword\\" section Dr. Giannini discusses the real-world application of this novel. It is a fictional work based on real-world therapy of actual patients. This fictional depiction of real-world therapeutic encounters with fiction worlds is then intended, once again,to be applied to real-world treatment.AJ Giannini. Afterword.(In) PJ Farmer. Red Orc's Rage. New York, NY, Tor Books, 1991,pp.279-282. Plot introduction Jim Grimson is a troubled youth undergoing therapy in a psychiatric hospital who is encouraged to role-play Red Orc, a character in a science fiction novel. Jim finds himself actually transported to the fictional World of Tiers, entering the mind and body of the character he role-played in the hospital. In the World of Tiers Red Orc/Jim struggles with an abusive father, a situation mirroring his real-world problems The character has Oedipal issues with his father, an unemployed crane operator in the fictional \\"Belmont City\\", somewhere near Youngstown, Ohio. The steel mills are closing permanently and the family is facing a bleak economic future. Jim struggles with class-issues at his high-school. In academics, athletics, and student society he is a non- achiever, recapitulating his father's position in the adult world. His only outlets are science fiction, the fantasies invented by his grandfather and some bizarre hallucination which occasionally intrude into his world. After a prank with an outhouse goes awry, Jim is arrested. He appears in court and is ordered to undergo a course of psychiatric evaluation and treatment in Wellington Hospital. While there he comes under the care of Dr. R. Lars Porsena. (This name is a play on \\"A. James Giannini\\". In most of Farmer's novels the protagonist's name or initials are a play on his or his collaborator's name). Dr. Porsena is also a science-fiction fan. After a conversation with Jim, he invites him to join a projective therapy group. This group is focusing on the \\"World of Tiers\\" series. After joining this group and participating in some sessions, Jim gains an insight. He realizes that hallucinations glimpsed prior to his admission are of the World of Tiers. Shortly afterwards he projects himself into the mind of the fictional lord, Red Orc. Throughout the remainder of the novel, Jim has multiple adventures in this lord's mind. He wanders through a universe filled with Freudian symbols and Jungian archetypes. He learns that Red Orc's father, the appropriately named (qv. William Blake) \\"Los\\", fears his son and attempts to prevent him from becoming lord of Los's universe. He imprisons him and attempts to suffocate him with jewels. He exiles him to a world where escape can only be had through narrow tunnels guarded by hairy spiders. During these adventures Red Orc is separately seduced by his mother and aunt. He also has sex with twenty of his sisters. During many of these adventures he is assisted by \\"Ijim\\". Ijim, his alter-ego, may or may not exist. During his adventures he is able to ride the totemic \\"white steed\\". While he is involved primarily in Red Orc's struggles, he must also deal with his own conflicts on earth. As a result of a frame-up Jim is almost expelled from the hospital and Dr. Porsena's position jeopardized. The conflict is resolved, in part, through insights Jim has gained while occupying the mind of Red Orc. During this time Ijim dies but Red Orc defeats Los and eats his testicles. The novel ends with Jim being discharged from Wellesley Hospital. His family situation has improved. He realizes that Dr. Porsena knows more about the worlds of Red Orc than that which could be obtained through his own sessions or from the books. He also realizes that some things are ultimately unknowable. =Afterword= An Afterword follows the text. This section is written by Dr. Giannini. It traces the origins of projective therapy and explains the technique. The utility of the World of Tiers for this purpose is discussed. This novel follows many Western traditions. Like Dante Alighieri in the Divine Comedy Jim travels with a companion who is unable to complete the journey. He enters a place of terror and wonder where punishment awaits those who violate a specific code. The novel is also a Bildungsroman, a coming-of-age novel in the German literary tradition. The protagonist must complete a journey of self and undergo loss to achieve adulthood, The Oedipal implications are quite obvious. Finally, this science-fiction novel takes its inspiration from the works of the English poet William Blake. Most of the characters in the alternative universe are found in the poetry and prose of Blake. Indeed, Blake does make an appearance as a character in a later \\"Tiers\\" novel.

History In the late 1980s the population of black rhinos, particularly in Zimbabwe, was dropping at an alarming rate. To help combat the decline, the International Black Rhino Foundation was founded in 1989. The IBRF worked with both in-situ conservation (protecting animals in their native habitat) and ex-situ conservation (protecting animals \\"off-site\\" such as in zoos or non-native nature reserves). The South-central Black Rhinoceros, which lives in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Tanzania, had a population of around 9,090 in 1980, but due to a wave of illegal poaching for its horn their numbers decreased to 1,300 in 1995. Due to the efforts of conservation groups like the International Black Rhino Foundation, the population has stabilized, illegal poaching has been reduced, and the population has even been growing. The population of South-central Black Rhinoceros was around 1,650 in 2001. Nine years later, there are about 4,000 black rhinos in the wild. In 1993, the IBRF changed its name to the International Rhino Foundation, and expanded its focus to all five species of rhinoceros. The International Rhino Foundation helps manage programs in nature and captivity and also funds research into rhinos. IRF programs in captivity focus on developing ways to help rhinos in the wild. Programs The International Rhino Foundation is active in several areas of rhino conservation. It hosts the Web sites for the African Rhino Specialist Group and the Asian Rhino Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission of the IUCN. =Sumatran and Javan Rhino Protection= The Critically Endangered Sumatran and Javan rhinoceros may be the most threatened of all land mammals on Earth. Fewer than 100 Sumatran rhinos may remain, primarily on Indonesia's Sumatra island. The population of Javan rhinos numbers only around 65-68 animals. Over the past 10 years, however, losses of Sumatran and Javan rhino have been nearly eliminated in Indonesia through intensive anti-poaching and intelligence activities by IRF-funded Rhino Protection Units. The successes of these units have kept the two species from extinction and are critical for their continued population recovery. Sumatran rhinos are considered extinct in Malaysia, but a tiny population (no more than 10) has recently been found in Kalimantan on the Island of Borneo. Overall, the population of Sumatran rhinos has decreased at a rate of about 50% over the past 15 years, largely from habitat encroachment, deforestation and habitat fragmentation. In Indonesia, IRF funds Rhino Protection Units (RPUs) which rigorously patrol forests to destroy snares and traps (the main method of poaching for these species) and apprehend poachers. By gathering intelligence from local communities, RPUs also proactively prevent poaching attempts before they take place. RPUs have been very effective in protecting the rhino from poachers - only five Sumatran rhinos have been lost to poachers since the inception of the program, and no Javan rhinos have been killed. By virtue of the RPUs‚Äô consistent presence and patrolling, other species, such as Sumatran tigers and elephants also benefit, as does the ecosystem as a whole. Eleven patrol units operate in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Sumatra, one of the highest priority areas for Sumatran megafauna. Approximately 15 Sumatran rhino inhabit the Park, along with 40-50 Sumatran tigers and around 500 Asian elephants. Nine patrol units operate in Way Kambas National Park, which has a resident population of about 30 Sumatran rhino and is also the site of the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary. Five patrol units operate in Ujung Kulon National Park, home to the only remaining viable population of Javan rhinos in the world. =Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary= Way Kambas Sanctuary Because of the challenges and uncertainties of conserving the Sumatran rhino, the IUCN Species Survival Commission's Asian Rhino Specialist Group recommended developing a captive breeding program as part of a larger population management strategy. Rhino experts agreed that successful reproduction would require sufficiently natural conditions and large enclosures. In the early 1990s, managed propagation centers (known as ‚Äúsanctuaries‚Äù) were developed in native habitat in the range states, to which some captive rhinos were repatriated. The first and still most important center is the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary (SRS) in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia. The SRS encompasses 100 hectares (250 acres) for propagation, research and education, and received its first rhino in 1998. Until recently, the Sanctuary held only one pair of animals, which were not reproductively sound. The SRS is now home to seven animals, including calves born in 2012 and 2016. It is staffed by two full-time Indonesian veterinarians, 11 keepers, several administrative and support staff, and protection units. Over the years, a number of circumstantial, medical, and management problems have been addressed and overcome. As a result, within the last decade, the husbandry and captive propagation of Sumatran rhinos has passed from its infancy to its adolescence. The International Rhino Foundation has been steadfastly working to address these issues with the expertise of numerous veterinarians and reproductive biologists. The seven Sumatran rhinos living at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary ‚Äì Rosa, Ratu, Bina, Andalas, Harapan and male calf, Andatu, born in 2012, and his sister Delilah born in 2016 ‚Äì serve as ambassadors for their wild counterparts; instruments for education for local communities and the general public; an ‚Äòinsurance‚Äô population that can be used to reestablish or revitalize wild populations that have been eliminated or debilitated; an invaluable resource for basic and applied biological research; and hopefully, in the future, as sources of animals for reintroductions, once threats have been ameliorated in the wild. = Indian Rhino Vision 2020 = Indian Rhinoceros In 2007, in partnership with the Assam Forest Department, WWF India, and the USFWS, the International Rhino Foundation embarked on an ambitious project, Indian Rhino Vision 2020, with the aim of increasing the population of Indian rhinos in Assam to 3,000 in at least seven protected areas by the year 2020. The first translocations, from Pabitora to Manas National Park, took place in April 2008. Animals were radio- collared and regularly monitored to gauge the success of the reintroduction process. Joint government/community patrol units regularly patrolled the park to prevent poaching and encroachment and to monitor the new rhino population.Over the next 4 years, IRV 2020 moved 18 Indian rhinos from Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Kaziranga National Park to Manas National Park (a protected area and UNESCO World Heritage site that had previously been home to a large rhino population before the poaching crisis). An additional eight rhinos were moved to Manas by the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation. In mid-2012, one of the female rhinos gave birth to the first calf born in Manas since rhino reintroductions began! Thirteen more rhinos births, including one second generation calf, have been born in the park since then ‚Äì a sure sign that the translocated animals are adapting well to their new home. Unfortunately, this population has also been tragically touched by poaching ‚Äì part of a region-wide increase in poaching in 2012-2013. After losing eight animals, IRV 2020 halted rhino translocations to Manas in 2013 to focus on improving security. Training in new patrolling methods, along with the support of new park leadership, has made a big difference ‚Äì only one rhino was lost to poaching in Manas in 2014, and the current population of 33 translocated rhinos and new calves continues to thrive. = Zimbabwe Lowveld Rhino Program = Black Rhinoceros in Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania Zimbabwe is home to the world's fourth largest black rhino population after South Africa, Namibia and Kenya. Organized gangs of poachers slaughtered nearly one-quarter of the country's rhinos between 2007 and 2009, as once again southern African nations faced an upsurge in poaching activity. The renewed poaching activity has been driven primarily by demand from Asian markets, particularly Vietnam and China. Formerly degraded land that was converted from cattle ranges to wildlife management areas, Zimbabwe's Lowveld region is now home to nearly 90% of the country's rhino population. These large land tracts operate as wildlife-based businesses that help safeguard a variety of threatened species. In early 2008, poaching in Zimbabwe reached critical levels and rhino numbers in the Lowveld began to decline for the first time since populations were established there in the early 1990s. IRF works primarily in the lowveld conservancies of Zimbabwe. The Lowveld Rhino Program concentrates its activities in two private conservancies where the majority of the rhino population lives and where there is still significant room for expansion ‚Äì Save Valley and Bubye Valley Conservancies. The first black rhinos were introduced into Bubye Valley in 2002 ‚Äì by 2012, the 100th black rhino had been born. Over the last 3 to 4 years, this population has been growing annually between 5 and 10%, which bodes well for the species‚Äô future in Zimbabwe. Based on the extent of available black rhino habitat in this region, the Lowveld Rhino Trust team is hopeful that another 100 calves could be born in the next 5 years. =Southern Africa Rhino Conservation Program= By the end of 2015, 1,342 rhinos had been killed by poachers in South Africa alone, overtaking the 1,215 rhinos slaughtered for their horns in 2014. About two-thirds of the killing has taken place in Kruger National Park, which shares a 221 porous miles of its 621-mile border with Mozambique. IRF's Operation: Stop Poaching Now campaign aims to raise awareness and funding for 10 Ways to Fight Rhino Poaching: ¬∑Boots on the Ground ¬∑Special Training ¬∑Early Warning and Community Involvement ¬∑Investigation and Forensic Techniques ¬∑Rhino Dogs ¬∑Law Enforcement Crackdown ¬∑Poaching Deterrents ¬∑Translocating Rhinos to Safety ¬∑Intensive Monitoring and Tracking ¬∑Demand Reduction Botswana In an effort to protect and increase the world's black rhino population by moving animals from a high-risk location to a new, safer area, in March 2014, IRF and partner Wilderness Safaris secured six black rhinos from South Africa's Kruger National Park for translocation to Botswana's Moremi Game Reserve. The group included one adult male, one pregnant adult female, two sub-adult males and two sub-adult females. An additional 14 black rhinos were captured in South Africa's North West Parks from in late May/early June and have subsequently been transported and released in Moremi. This second group included six males and eight females, from 1.5 to more than 10 years of age. With the exception of one bull lost to fighting, all animals are doing well, and are fitted with radio transmitters and tracked regularly. South Africa Great Fish River Nature Reserve covers some 46,000 ha (113,668 acres) of prime shrubby rhino habitat, which holds a growing population of black rhino that must be protected at all costs. IRF's grants helped to build and equip new guard posts in areas where it was previously difficult for staff to operate because of a lack of accommodations, and has funded a secure communications system for the reserve.. In Phinda Private Game Reserve, also an important rhino area, IRF has funding a rapid response team that can preemptively respond to ever- increasing poaching incursions. Funds have also strengthened relationships with local communities, a valuable source of information that can help to avert poaching, supplied a secure communications system as well as other security measures.

It was discovered by Belgian astronomer Eug√®ne Delporte at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle on 17 September 1928. The asteroid was named after the goddess Neith from Egyptian mythology.  Orbit and classification  Neith is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 1.9‚Äì3.3 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,536 days; semi-major axis of 2.61 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.26 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its observation as at Heidelberg Observatory in November 1924, almost four years prior to its official discovery observation at Uccle.  Physical characteristics  Neith has been characterized as an uncommon A-type asteroid during a spectroscopic survey after it had previously been classified as X-type in the Tholen taxonomy. The asteroid's surface shows a strong 0.96 Œºm absorption band (depth of 24%) and a steep slope in the near- infrared region, typical of olivine-rich bodies. The survey was conducted at the NTT, TNG and IRTF telescopes during 2004‚Äì2007. = Rotation period = In September 2008, a rotational lightcurve of Neith was obtained from photometric observations by Julian Oey at the Leura and Kingsgrove Observatory in Australia. Lightcurve analysis gave a synodic rotation period of 12.5990 hours with a brightness variation of 0.08 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS (SIMPS and MSX), the Spitzer Space Telescope (MIPS photometer and MIPSGAL survey) and the NEOWISE mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Neith measures between 11.566 and 13.84 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.206 and 0.4450. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.2756 and a diameter of 11.73 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.67.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Egyptian mythology after the goddess of Libyan origin, Neith, goddess of the hunt and of war, believed to be the mother of the Sun. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

One of the claims of EJJP is Israel's immediate withdrawal from the occupied territories. History The organisation was founded in Amsterdam in September 2002. Its principles are contained in its Amsterdam Declaration of 2002, amended in 2004. These are: > *the condemnation of all violence against civilians in the conflict, no > matter by whom it is carried out *the recognition of Israel's 1967 'green > line' borders *commitment to the Palestinians' right to a state in the > territories currently occupied by Israel in the West Bank, East Jerusalem > and Gaza *the recognition of the right of both states to have Jerusalem as > their capital *calling on Israel to acknowledge its part in the creation of > the Palestinian refugee problem and its obligation to negotiate a just, fair > and practical resolution of the issue. In an opinion article published in The Guardian in February 2009, Antony Lerman, the former (2006-2009) director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research considers that Jewish peace groups like European Jews for a Just Peace and Independent Jewish Voices in Canada and Australia \\"may have a moderating influence on Israel\\" as \\"Israel is heavily dependent on what Jews think\\". In September 2010, EJJP organized a Gaza-bound aid boat, the \\"Jewish Boat to Gaza\\", carrying nine Jewish activists. It was intercepted by the Israel Defense Forces and led to the port of Ashdod. The EJJP chairperson, Dror Feiler, an Israel-born Swedish national, was again aboard the French Dignit√©-Al Karama ship in the 2011 flotilla for Gaza.

He claims to be the only outwardly Conservative Party voter on the British comedy circuit, and in 2017, was listed as one of the 'Top 100 Most Influential People on the Conservative Right'. Early life Norcott was raised in South London. His parents divorced when he was nine, and his mother moved with him and his elder sister to a council estate in Wimbledon. He attended Southfields Secondary School, before moving to Rutlish School in Merton Park, the same school attended by Conservative Prime Minister John Major. Norcott holds an English degree from Goldsmiths, University of London, and worked previously as an English teacher. Early career Norcott performed at his first comedy gig in September 2001, initially performing as a way of supplementing his teaching income. In 2005, Norcott was approached to appear on radio and television, as a panellist and presenter on shows for Talksport, Nuts TV and the BBC. He received an Operational Service Medal for five frontline tours entertaining the troops in Afghanistan. Recent career In 2013, Norcott was nominated for 'Best New Show' at the Leicester Comedy Festival for his show Geoff Norcott Occasionally Sells Out, about - among other things - the fact he was now a Conservative voter, which he then took to the Edinburgh Fringe. He returned to the Fringe in 2015 with The Look of Moron, a further development of his voice as a political comic, and again in 2016 with Conswervative, which received wide political acclaim and a successful sold-out run. In early 2017, Norcott made his first appearances on Question Time and as a regular on BBC Two's The Mash Report, both of which he continues to appear on to date. Norcott took another show, Right Leaning, But Well Meaning, to the Fringe the same year to further acclaim, and the show was later recorded as a radio special for BBC Radio 4, airing in 2018. In 2018, he made his first appearance on Live at the Apollo, and took a new show, Traditionalism on a UK tour. Later the same year, Norcott appeared on Mock the Week for the first time, receiving an online backlash being the first openly Brexit voting comic to appear on the show. He has also appeared on several UK political debate shows, including Politics Live and Daily Politics. Norcott has written for a number of UK television shows, including A League of Their Own, 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and Frankie Boyle's New World Order. A 2019 appearance on Question Time prompted another online backlash for Norcott, after a clip of him calling out European Union President Donald Tusk went viral. The same year, he presented the BBC Two documentary How The Middle Classes Ruined Britain, in which he investigated issues like how some people 'gamed' the system to secure places in good schools, and accusations of social cleansing in housing. Personal life Norcott lives in Cambridgeshire with his wife, whom he married in 2004. They have one child.

Prelude  On April 8, 1992, Iraqi Kurdish leaders agreed to stop the PKK's raids into Turkey from their territory in an attempt to create good relations with Turkey. In response, the PKK cut supply routes from Turkey to Iraqi Kurdistan on July 31. To re-open the supply roots, Peshmerga loyal to the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (Iraqi Kurdistan's ruling parties), started an offensive on October 4 to drive the PKK from Northern Iraq.  The Operation  On August 6, the Turkish Air Force launched air raids to support Iraqi Kurdish forces in their offensive against the PKK. After the air raids, Turkey launched an operation against the PKK, using 20,000 ground troops, backed by tanks, helicopters and aircraft. It was estimated the PKK had over 8,000 fighters in the region. Turkey claimed to have killed and captured nearly 3 thousand PKK fighters and wounded 2,700 by November 5, with over 1,000 surrendering to Iraqi Kurdish forces, a number which rose to 1,400 by 12 November. In mid-November Turkish forces started to withdraw after claiming to have reduced the PKK's fighting force to a mere 2,500. The PKK acknowledged only 150 casualties. Most of the PKK's strength, including most of their experienced fighters, were based inside of Turkey at the time and so they lacked both manpower and resources inside Iraq. As supplies started to run out and PKK commanders also found it increasingly difficult to communicate with Abdullah √ñcalan in Syria. Therefore, his brother Osman √ñcalan agreed to meet with Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan Fuad Masum on October 30 to negotiate. The negotiations were supported by Faruk \\"Nasir\\" Bozkur but were opposed by Murat \\"Cemal\\" Karayƒ±lan, which were the two other main commanders in Northern Iraq. On November 17, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the PKK reached a truce accord under which the PKK would re-open all routes to Turkey and release 2 captured Turkish soldiers. A buffer zone between Iraq and Turkey was to be created to prevent further PKK activities, however, according to Turkish officials this did not happen due to a lack of cooperation from the KRG.  Casualties  Turkey announced fatalities at a total of 28 personnel made out of 1 commissioned officer, 3 noncommissioned officers, 22 soldiers and 2 village guards. Turkey announced the injured at a total of 125 personnel made out of 12 commissioned officers 16 noncommissioned officers, 93 soldiers, and 4 village guards. Turkey announced the total number of militants neutralized at a total of 2,783 with 1,551 being killed and 1,232 being captured.

The Grothendieck construction for F is the category \\\\Gamma(F) (also written \\\\textstyle\\\\int_{\\\\textstyle\\\\mathcal{C}} F, \\\\textstyle\\\\mathcal{C} \\\\int F or F \\\\rtimes \\\\mathcal{C}), with * objects being pairs (c,x), where c\\\\in \\\\operatorname{obj}(\\\\mathcal{C}) and x\\\\in \\\\operatorname{obj}(F(c)); and * morphisms in \\\\operatorname{hom}_{\\\\Gamma(F)}((c_1,x_1),(c_2,x_2)) being pairs (f, g) such that f: c_1 \\\\to c_2 in \\\\mathcal{C}, and g: F(f)(x_1) \\\\to x_2 in F(c_2).

Slogan  \\"The Grothendieck construction takes structured, tabulated data and flattens it by throwing it all into one big space.

The requirement that F be a functor is then equivalent to specifying a group homomorphism \\\\varphi:G\\\\to\\\\operatorname{Aut}(H), where \\\\operatorname{Aut}(H) denotes the group of automorphisms of H. Finally, the Grothendieck construction, F \\\\rtimes \\\\mathcal{C}_G, results in a category with one object, which can again be viewed as a group, and in this case, the resulting group is (isomorphic to) the semidirect product H \\\\rtimes_\\\\varphi G.

The school's mascot is the Falcons, and the school colors are Royal Blue and White. History Mashpee High School opened in 1996. Before then, Mashpee students attended neighboring Falmouth High School. In the early 1990s, Mashpee voted to open its own high school after the town had experienced an exponential increase in its population. Since 1970, Mashpee's town population has increased by ten times in size and was one of the state's fastest growing towns from 1970-2000. The town population as of the 2010 census is approximately 14,000 and the student population is roughly 1,700. As of 2015, The high school's principal is Mr. Mark Balestracci. Mashpee High School originally served students in grades 7‚Äì12, but in 2008, the school board decided to separate high school students from the 7th and 8th grade students. Mashpee High School now served students in grades 9‚Äì12, and the 7th and 8th grade students attend the newly established Mashpee Middle School, which is located in the same building as Mashpee High School, but runs under its own administration, has its own teachers and staff, and has its own sports teams separate from the high school. In 2014, the middle & high schools were once again consolidated to run under one administration. The middle school is represented by a headmaster who runs under direction of the principal. Due to the re-consolidation, 8th grade students in the school will be allowed to participate in high school level athletics, including the varsity level, while 7th graders will only be allowed to participate in middle school level athletics, unless certain athletic teams or programs are not offered at the middle school program. In which case, 7th graders will be allowed to compete in high school athletics at only the junior varsity level. The athletics waiver was granted by the MIAA and took effect during the 2015-2016 academic year. Of the approximately 700 students at Mashpee High, 6.2% of the student population is Native American, the highest percentage of any high school in New England.https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/10/19/mashpee-high- football-team-driven-succeed/4XIeXG0NM3ARy5og6cuBvK/story.html Every year since 2004, Mashpee High School‚Äôs graduation has opened with a traditional Wampanoag language travel blessing, followed by a traditional Wampanoag drum circle song and performance by the \\"Red Hawk Singers\\", who perform two traditional travel and blessing Wampanoag songs.

It grows to about 25 m. This species was first described by the Russian botanist Carl Johann Maximowicz, in Bulletin de la Classe Physico-Math√©matique de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint-P√©tersbourg, which was published in 1856. The leaves are alternate, 40‚Äì90 cm long, odd-pinnate, with 7‚Äì19 leaflets, 6‚Äì17 cm long and 2‚Äì7.5 cm broad (margin serrate or serrulate, apex acuminate). The male flowers are in drooping catkins 9‚Äì40 cm long, the wind-pollinated female flowers (April‚ÄìMay) are terminal, in spikes of 4 to 10, ripening in August‚ÄìOctober into nuts, 3-7.5 √ó 3‚Äì5 cm, with densely glandular pubescent green husk and very thick shell. The tree is exceptionally hardy (down to at least -45 ¬∞C), has a relatively short vegetation period compared to other walnuts, grows rapidly and is cultivated as an ornamental in colder temperate regions all over the Northern Hemisphere. (For example, it has been found to grow satisfactorily in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.) The kernels of the nuts are edible, but small and difficult to extract. The timber is in use, but less valuable than that of English walnut or black walnut. rightThe Manchurian walnut contains and exudes much lesser quantities of allelopathic compounds (such as juglone) than other popular Juglans species–ü–æ–º–æ–≥–∞–π–±–∏–Ω –ê.–í., –ö–∞–≤–µ–ª–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –õ.–ú., –°–∏–ª–∞–µ–≤–∞ –û.–ù.

Culinary tourism or food tourism or gastronomy tourism is the exploration of food as the purpose of tourism. It is now considered a vital component of the tourism experience. Dining out is common among tourists and \\"food is believed to rank alongside climate, accommodation, and scenery\\" in importance to tourists. Overview Culinary or food tourism is the pursuit of unique and memorable eating and drinking experiences, both near and far. Culinary tourism differs from agritourism in that culinary tourism is considered a subset of cultural tourism (cuisine is a manifestation of culture) whereas agritourism is considered a subset of rural tourism, but culinary tourism and agritourism are inextricably linked, as the seeds of cuisine can be found in agriculture. Culinary/food tourism is not limited to gourmet food. Food tourism can be considered a subcategory of experiential travel. While many cities, regions or countries are known for their food, culinary tourism is not limited by food culture. Every tourist eats about three times a day, making food one of the fundamental economic drivers of tourism. Countries like Ireland, Peru and Canada are making significant investment in culinary tourism development and are seeing results with visitor spending and overnight stays rising as a result of food tourism promotion and product development. The World Food Travel Association offers the following clarification and definition: > We say \\"food tourism\\", but drinking beverages is an implied and associated > activity. It is also cumbersome to say \\"food and drink tourism\\". We need to > clarify \\"far and near\\". In addition to traveling across country or the world > to eat or drink, we can also be food travelers in our own regions, cities > and neighborhoods. If you rarely leave your neighborhood and travel across > town to a new neighborhood to go to a special grocery store or to eat out, > you're a \\"food traveler\\" in your own backyard! The act of traveling is > implied because most people travel at least across their own town, if not > the region, the country and even the planet. The distance covered is not as > important as the fact that we are always on the move. We are all \\"travelers\\" > of a sort and we are all \\"eaters\\". Therefore, we can also all be regarded as > \\"food travelers\\". Previously the World Food Travel Association had used the > phrase \\"culinary tourism\\" to describe our industry. We stopped using that > phrase in 2012 because our research indicated that it gave a misleading > impression. While \\"culinary\\" technically can be used for anything relating > to food and drink and initially seems to make good sense, the perception > among the majority of English-speakers we interviewed is that the word > \\"culinary\\" is elitist. Nothing could be further from the truth about what > our industry is all about. \\"Food Tourism\\" includes [sic] the food carts and > street vendors as much as the locals-only (gastro)pubs, dramatic wineries, > or one-of-a-kind restaurants. There is something for everyone in the food > tourism industry. Food tourism includes activities such as: # Cooking classes # Food tours # Wine, beer and food festivals # Specialty dining experiences  Economic impact  Culinary tourism became prominent in 2001. The World Food Travel Association estimates that food and beverage expenses account for 15% to 35% of all tourism spending, depending on the affordability of the destination. The WFTA lists possible food tourism benefits as including more visitors, more sales, more media attention, increased tax revenue, and greater community pride.  Cooking classes  A growing area of culinary tourism is cooking classes. The formats vary from a short lesson lasting a few hours to full-day and multi-day courses. The focus for foreign tourists will usually be on the cuisine of the country they are visiting, whereas local tourists may be keen to experience cuisines new to them. Many cooking classes also include market tours to enhance the cultural experience. Some cooking classes are held in local people's homes, allowing foreign tourists to catch a glimpse of what daily life and cuisine look like for those in the country they're visiting. Both the local hosts and foreign guests benefit from the cross-cultural experience. Food tours A home dinner in Bali, Indonesia (2016), made as part of a Withlocals food tour. The oldest bar serving dough named pasztecik szczeci≈Ñski in the center of Szczecin (Poland), a popular destination for tourists visiting the city. Pasztecik szczeci≈Ñski is one of traditional dishes of Pomerania The food tour formula varies from tour to tour and from operator to operator (of which there are many). Most, however, feature the following elements: # They operate in major cities that have substantial tourist numbers. Tours exist ‚Äì among other places - in London, Paris, Rome, Florence, Toronto, See also Culinary Adventure Co. Istanbul, New York City, Lisbon, Berlin, Madrid, Belfast, San Francisco, Copenhagen, Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, Athens, Kuala Lumpur, Marrakech and Barcelona. Operators must find a city with a vibrant and interesting food culture. Street food may feature. # Tours are generally on foot. The distances traveled are never large and may focus on a few adjoining streets. Some cycle tour companies offer food tours by bike. # Tours typically last at least three hours, although many last longer. Tours generally start and end at public transport hubs such as metro stations. # Group sizes range from private small groups to around 20 people or more. # Tours rarely charge for small children who share food with parents/carers. Tours may not be necessarily fully compliant with wheelchair use ‚Äì this will depend on the exact tour and the attitude of each location to disability. # Tours take visitors to places they might otherwise not have seen, so they can shop and eat like locals rather than rely on tourist traps. Phrases such as ‚Äúeat the city like a real Parisian/Berliner/Londoner/New Yorker‚Äù are often employed in food tour publicity. # All tours are guided by local people. Many tour guides add their local knowledge as a bonus, perhaps recommending restaurants in other parts of the city. # Tours are primarily about food. The format varies from company to company but will generally include visits to markets, bars, and caf√©s where those on the tour are invited to sample the wares. There is usually a shop visit to buy the sort of food that is difficult to source elsewhere. Tours may end up with a sit-down meal at a restaurant where there is usually the choice of beer, wine or soft drinks. # Guides talk about food, often pointing those on the tour to shops they use. They may discuss how the sort of food they and their families eat differs from the food generally offered to tourists. They are unlikely to be kindly disposed to international fast food outlets. # Guides generally add material about the history of the area the tour is in. # Tours assume that participants eat almost anything and are not designed for special diets. # Many tour companies aim to create a sustainable tourism model over which they provide to their clients an experience that makes a positive impact on the local environment, society and economy by working only with local producers and/or family own establishments, and celebrating local traditions, all on foot, which means having a zero carbon footprint. June 10, 2017, was the first annual National Food Tour Day, celebrating food tourism around the world.National Food Tour Day The World Food Travel Association introduced World Food Travel Day on April 18, 2019 as a way to put the spotlight on how and why we travel to experience the world's culinary cultures. It is designed to bring awareness to both consumers and trade, and support the Association's mission - to preserve and promote culinary cultures through hospitality and tourism.

It took over the Crowborough Birthing Centre, formerly run by East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust in November 2015. Management The Trust, with East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust is jointly procuring an electronic patient record system in a contract worth ¬£10m - ¬£40m in December 2013. During 2014 the Trust paid Ian Miller more than ¬£250,000 for five months‚Äô work as an interim finance director. The funds were paid to The Maxentius Partnership, his own consultancy business. The Trust justified the expense by saying ‚ÄúThe independent financial expertise was essential in helping the Trust achieve ¬£23.5 million in efficiency savings last year without impacting on patient care.‚Äù The trust has accommodation for about 200 staff close to its hospitals. It anticipates an influx of overseas nurses in 2019/20 and plans to offer them this accommodation on a temporary basis. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ It was heavily criticized in 2007 by the Healthcare Commission regarding its handling of a major outbreak of Clostridium difficile in its hospitals from April 2004 to September 2006. In its report, the Commission estimated that about 90 patients \\"definitely or probably\\" died as a result of the infection. The Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson, described the 90 patients' deaths as \\"scandalous\\". In a subsequent investigation by the Healthcare Commission the outbreak was connected to the financial reorganisations that the hospital trust was undergoing, such as its private finance initiative. In this regard, Richard James, Professor of Microbiology at the University of Nottingham noted striking parallels with Stoke Mandeville hospital, which experienced a severe C. difficile outbreak in 2003-5. In April 2015 the Trust was the first NHS trust to be charged with corporate manslaughter under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 after 30-year-old Frances Cappuccini died after giving birth by emergency caesarean section in October 2012 at Pembury Hospital. Two doctors involved were charged with gross negligence manslaughter. Errol Cornish, a locum consultant anaesthetist was charged. Dr Nadeem Azeez would have been charged, but left the country. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coulson, instructed the jury that there was no case to answer and the case was dismissed, after 2 weeks, in January 2016. He said evidence showed some of Cornish‚Äôs actions had been ‚Äúabout as far from a gross negligence manslaughter case as it is possible to be‚Äù and called some of the arguments against the trust ‚Äúperverse‚Äù. He also criticised Jeremy Hunt for sending a ‚Äúhighly inappropriate‚Äù tweet during the trial. It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 4964 full time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.97%. 73% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 63% recommended it as a place to work. In February 2016 it was expecting a deficit of ¬£23.5 million for the year.

Biography Bleckmann was born in Dortumund, Germany. He planned to be an ice skater before becoming a vocalist. In 1989 he moved to New York City and recorded his first two albums, Theo & Kirk (1992) and Looking Glass River (1995) with Kirk Nurock. His mentor was Sheila Jordan, and he appeared on her album Jazz Child (1999). With guitarist Ben Monder he recorded his first solo album, Origami (2001), an album of impressionistic vocalese and lyrics sung in German and French. He collaborated with pianist Fumio Yasuda on the albums Las Vegas Rhapsody: The Night They Invented Champagne (2006), Berlin ‚Äì Songs of Love and War, Peace and Exile (2007), and Schumann's Favored Bar Songs (2009). The last album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Classical Crossover Album. He was given the ECHO Jazz award for I Dwell in Possibility (Winter & Winter, 2010). The album was inspired by the Arte Povera, the Italian art movement in the 1960s that created installations with the simplest materials. In making the album Beckman used music boxes, megaphones, autoharp, glasses, water, shruti, and toys. Bleckmann's second collaboration with Yusada was an extension of his love for music from his native Germany, concerning the themes of love, war, and peace. The repertoire consisted of works by composers Hanns Eisler, Kurt Weill, Kristian Schultze with Bertolt Brecht providing much of the texts. In 2010 he recorded an album as the group Moss with vocalists Peter Eldridge, Lauren Kinhan, Kate McGarry, and Luciana Souza. With the jazz rock group Kneebody he recorded an album of unorthodox arrangements of compositions by Charles Ives. Four years later he recorded an album songs written by pop singer Kate Bush with drummer John Hollenbeck, bassist Skuli Sverrisson, keyboardist Henry Hey, and Caleb Burhans on viola and guitar. He has worked with Laurie Anderson, Anthony Braxton, Steve Coleman, Dave Douglas, Philip Glass, Michael Tilson Thomas, John Zorn, and the Bang on a Can All-Stars. He was a guest vocalist with the San Francisco Symphony Chorus, Estonian Radio Choir, Merce Cunningham Dance Company, and Mark Morris Dance. For fifteen years he was a member of an ensemble led by Meredith Monk.  Performance pieces  =Fidget= Bleckmann's multidisciplinary works include a commission by the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris to compose and create a music performance piece out of Kenneth Goldsmith's text Fidget, which Bleckmann scored for voice, piano, percussion, bass, video and three sewing machines. In real time, four seamstresses sewed a paper suit out of the hundreds of sheets of paper that were Bleckmann's libretto. =Mercuria= In collaboration with performance artist Lynn Book, he created Mercuria (produced by the Whitney Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago), incorporating visual and vocal elements of dream and subconsciousness into an evening-length performance piece. =The True Last Words of Dutch Schultz= Playing the gangster Dutch Schultz, Bleckmann co-created The True Last Words of Dutch Schultz a new music opera in collaboration with director Valeria Vasilevski and composer Eric Salzman. Film, television, and theater As a sound improviser, he has performed, created and developed movie, television, and theater scores, among them an alleged space Alien language for Men in Black by Steven Spielberg, Star Trek: Envoy (Meredith Monk) and Kundun (Philip Glass) Bleckmann sang in John Moran's Book of the Dead at The Public Theater in New York, performed a lead in Bang on a Can's Obie Award-winning opera Carbon Copy Building, and frequently appears as a soloist with The Bang on a Can All-Stars. In collaboration with director Laurie McCants and set designer Elaine F.

Top-down proteomics is capable of identifying and quantitating unique proteoforms through the analysis of intact proteins. The name is derived from the similar approach to DNA sequencing. During mass spectrometry intact proteins are typically ionized by electrospray ionization and trapped in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (Penning trap), quadrupole ion trap (Paul trap) or Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Fragmentation for tandem mass spectrometry is accomplished by electron-capture dissociation or electron-transfer dissociation. Effective fractionation is critical for sample handling before mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. Proteome analysis routinely involves digesting intact proteins followed by inferred protein identification using mass spectrometry (MS). Top-down MS (non-gel) proteomics interrogates protein structure through measurement of an intact mass followed by direct ion dissociation in the gas phase.  Advantages  * The main advantages of the top-down approach include the ability to detect degradation products, protein isoforms, sequence variants, combinations of post-translational modifications as well as simplified processes for data normalization and quantitation. * Top-down proteomics, when accompanied with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, can help to complement the bottom-up proteomic approach. Top-down proteomic methods can assist in exposing large deviations from predictions and has been very successfully pursued by combining Gel Elution Liquid-based Fractionation Entrapment Electrophoresis fractionation, protein precipitation, and reverse phase HPLC with electrospray ionization and MS/MS. * Characterization of small proteins represents a significant challenge for bottom up proteomics due to the inability to generate sufficient tryptic peptides for analysis. Top-down proteomics allows for low mass protein detection, thus increasing the repertoire of proteins known. While Bottom-up proteomics integrates cleaved products from all proteoforms produced by a gene into a single peptide map of the full-length gene product to tabulate and quantify expressed proteins, a major strength of Top-down proteomics is that it enables researchers to quantitatively track one or more proteoforms from multiple samples and to excise these proteoforms for chemical analysis.  Disadvantages  * In the recent past, the top down approach was relegated to analysis of individual proteins or simple mixtures, while complex mixtures and proteins were analyzed by more established methods such as Bottom-up proteomics. Additionally protein identification and proteoform characterization in the TDP (Top-down proteomics) approach can suffer from a dynamic range challenge where the same highly abundant species are repeatedly fragmented. * Although Top-down proteomics can be operated in relatively high output in order to successfully map proteome coverage at a large level, the rate of identifying new proteins after initial rounds reduces quite sharply. * Top-down proteomics interrogation can overcome problems for identifying individual proteins, but has not been achieved on a large scale due to a lack of intact protein fractionation methods that are integrated with tandem mass spectrometry.  Research and uses  _Study One: Quantitation and Identification of Thousands of Human Proteoforms below 30 kDa_ * Researchers performed a study of human proteoforms below 30kDa, used primary IMR90 human fibroblasts containing a Ras function construct that were grown in medium. * Chose to use Top-Down Proteomics to characterize these proteoforms because it is currently the best method for intact proteins, as I discussed Bottom Up digests the protein and does not do a good job of providing a clear image of distinct intact proteoforms. * Top Down Proteomics is capable of identifying and quantitating unique proteoforms through the analysis of intact proteins. The Top-down quantitation yielded changes in abundance of 1038 cytoplasmic proteoforms. _Study Two: Combining high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis for virtual 2D gel-based proteomics_ * Researchers used top-down proteomics because could identify the exact proteoforms of intact proteins, rather than the bottom-up approach which gives fragment ions of peptides. * This study used Virtual 2D gel along with Mass Spectrometry in order to separate protein mixtures. MALDI is a computer software that generates the intact masses of the proteins at each isoelectric point. It started with an image of an IPG-IEF (isoelectric focusing) gel selection that was then analyzed by MALDI. * Top-down proteomics MALDI- TOF/TOF-MS is more tolerant to impurities; does not require biomarker extraction, purification, and separation; and can be directly applied to intact microorganisms.

It has since been recorded by many jazz and swing musicians including Benny Goodman and Roy Eldridge. Composition and notable recordings Clay Boland, while studying dentistry at the University of Scranton and University of Pennsylvania, taught himself to play piano and worked in dance bands. In 1936 he started work as a writer/director for Penn's Mask and Wig show. One of his first compositions for the production Red Rumba was \\"Too Good to Be True\\", for which Boland wrote the lyrics and music. The song, which became a favorite of the swing era, recalls the proverbial expression \\"it seems too good to be true,\\" and alludes to the singer's presumed love interest. Musician-author Warren Vach√© called the song \\"a little gem\\" that was \\"promptly slated for immortality with an outstanding recording by the Benny Goodman Trio featuring Helen Ward on the vocal.\\" This version, originally released on a Victor 78 rpm record in 1936, was later included on The Complete Benny Goodman, Vol. 2 (1935-1936) compilation album.Pareles, Jon (30 April 1998). Helen Ward, 82, Who Sang Hits With Goodman's Band in the 30's, The New York Times Trumpeter Roy Eldridge also released a version of the song in 1936. The recording features the Teddy Wilson Orchestra, which included a rhythm section consisting of Wilson (piano), Sid Catlett (drums), and Israel Crosby (bass). Musician-writer John Goldsby noted that \\"Too Good to Be True\\" is among the songs that exemplified Crosby's early playing. \\"You can hear the seeds of Israel's melodic style, especially in the eighth-note countermelodies he plays behind Chu Berry's saxophone solo.\\" Trumpeter-writer John Chilton described Berry's solo as \\"a ravishing interpretation of the 32-bar theme\\" and suggested it was reminiscent of Coleman Hawkins' saxophone playing on the 1933 song \\"The Day You Came Along\\". Other versions The song has been recorded many other times, and can be considered a standard.

He was a scholar of Japanese religion, and served as an advisor on religion and cultural resources during the allied command after World War II. Personal life In 1918 Woodard graduated from Kalamazoo College with a history degree. He spent a short period of military service as a sergeant during World War I. Woodard married Harriet Mead in May 1920 and graduated from Union Theological Seminary in 1921. Harriet died in Tokyo, October 9, 1956. Later that year, Woodard married Margaret (Peggy) Cuddeback, a missionary and YWCA secretary. Woodard died February 20, 1973, in Pomona, California. Career In 1921 he went to Japan as a missionary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (Congregational Christian Churches). He stayed in Japan until 1941. During the later part of his stay he worked as a secretary in the headquarters of the Kumiai Christian Church. From 1942 to 1947, he served in the U.S. Navy as an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He returned to Japan in 1945 after the end of World War II. He remained in Japan working with the military in a variety of roles related to the Religious Juridical Persons Law, until the end of the Allied occupation in 1952, when he returned to the States. In 1953 he went back to Japan to found the International Institute for the Study of Religions. He served as their director until 1966, when he again returned to the United States. After returning to the States, Woodard lectured at Claremont Graduate School from 1966 until 1972.

Yamuna Action Plan Phase II The Yamuna Action Plan Project Phase II, begun in 2003, is regarded as the core project under the National River Conservation Plan of Government of India. The project addresses the abatement of severe pollution of the River Yamuna by raising sewage treatment capacity, caused by rapid population growth, industrialization and urbanization in the towns of the river basin, which includes Delhi, the capital of India. Building new and expanding capacity of old sewage treatment plants and laying and rehabilitating sewers will be done to enhance the treatment capacity particularly in Delhi and Agra. These works will lead to improvement of the sanitation conditions for the residents of towns in the river basin. Public participation and awareness activities which are part of the project shall ensure the residents' recognition of the necessity of water quality conservation in the River Yamuna, and would establish linkage between the river conservation and their own living environments. the project was still going forward with an additional phase to clean pollution from the river. The Yamuna is a tributary of the Ganges. Water Resources Minister Mr. Gadkari was hopeful that the Ganges River will be completely free of pollution by March 2020.

Early history  Flynt was discharged from the Navy in 1964 where he had served as a radar operator. After this stint in the Navy he worked in manufacturing jobs including one at a General Motors factory in Dayton, Ohio. In 1965, with $1,800 in savings, he made a down payment on a bar in one of Dayton's working-class neighborhoods.Pederson, Jay. International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 31. St. James Press, 2000. He specifically targeted working class patrons for his new bar by setting up horseshoe stakes and picnic tables and naming it Hillbilly Haven. Because of this, Flynt exponentially increased the bar's sales. By the end of 1965, Flynt was able to buy a second bar, and, the following year, a third. Both were similar in approach and customer base to Hillbilly Haven. Flynt opened a fourth bar named Whatever's Right. He purposely made this bar different from his earlier ventures. He sought to make this bar a \\"more elegant atmosphere\\" and geared it more to affluent and upscale male patrons. The club featured a dance floor and attractive hostesses whose job was to dance with patrons. These dancing hostesses were a huge success. In 1968, Flynt took this hostess idea a step further by opening the first Hustler Club which features semi- clothed girls. He figured that if fully clothed girls resulted in good sales, then semi-clothed girls would make great sales. His thoughts were right and the one Hustler Club in Dayton quickly creating a chain of clubs with the same name in Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, and Akron. Flynt sold his first two bars to focus on his Hustler Clubs and by early 1970, he had eight clubs and 300 employees.  Closing  Flynt began publishing the Hustler Newsletter containing information about his various clubs. By 1974 the Hustler Newsletter had morphed into the full-fledged magazine, Hustler.

Alex Loeb was a merchant in Meridian in the late 19th century.

Born in Bavaria, Simon Loeb arrived in Columbus in 1867. In 1874, he created the store with his younger brother, Julius. They sold dry goods, clothing, and shoes. Although Simon arrived in Columbus with little money, he and his brother eventually became successful merchants. During Meridian's \\"golden age\\" in the early 20th century, it was said that respectable railroad workers would only wear clothes from Alex Loeb's store. The well-dressed Loeb was a colorful character known for his white mustache, ever-present cigar, and hospitable personality; he would personally welcome each customer as he or she entered the store. Alex Loeb's son, Abraham Marshall Loeb, and his brother Henry S. Loeb took over the business after their father. The business then passed to A. Marshall Loeb's son, Robert Switzer Loeb Sr., and his brother Alexander Marshall Loeb. The two brothers Robert and Alex acquired the Marks-Rothenberg Co. department store on 6th Street during the 1970s and ran the business until the late 1970s when the business was sold to Zale Corporation. In the year 1988 Robert S. Loeb, Jr. returned to Meridian after working in buying management at Parisian department store in Birmingham, Alabama.

Headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, it assists women legislators with public opinion and legislative issues. Organization Through annual educational and networking events, the National Foundation for Women Legislators supports elected women from all levels of governance. As a non- profit, non-partisan organization, NFWL does not take ideological positions on public policy issues, but rather serves as a forum for women legislators to be empowered through information and experience. Commentary The greatest rising force in American politics today is not a political party, nor is it a lobbying community, it is women. Thirty years ago, women held a mere 10% of all state legislative seats in the country, today they hold 24.8% of 7,383 seats nationwide. Currently 20 women currently serve in the US Senate and 84 serve in the US House of Representatives, while 74 women hold statewide elective office including 6 state governorships. Women chair numerous committees, they influence policy and they understand the importance of building bipartisan coalitions in support of the nation's most pressing concerns to ensure widespread change in both thought and policy on a variety of issues. See also The NFWL Annual Conference is a national forum designed to encourage the building of alliances among elected women, industry leaders, and issue experts. The Conference fosters a safe environment for sharing ideas, discussing current events, and learning about new initiatives and programs through plenary sessions, workshops, roundtables and policy committees. The goal of the Annual Conference is to intellectually equip elected women to mold public opinion and prepare for legislative debate. Presentations throughout the Conference offer elected women new perspectives and innovative ideas that may inevitably lead to policy resolutions and legislation in their respective states. As a non-partisan organization, NFWL does not take ideological positions on any current issue, but rather exists to assist women leaders in the process of issue education, networking, re- elections, and leadership. NFWL's Annual Conference is unique because a majority of the elected women who attend the Conference are given scholarships to support their presence. As a result, NFWL garners high attendance rates at all Conference events. This allows NFWL's supporters to have direct access to elected women from across the country in a variety of settings.

The waterways which almost completely surround the Hampton Roads region also play an important part in the local economy. As a strategic location at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, its protected deep water channels serve as major arteries for the import and export of goods from across the Mid-Atlantic, Mid-West, and international destinations, as well as being the location of the world's largest naval base.Naval Station Norfolk Military USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) arriving at Naval Station Norfolk Hampton Roads is a major military center, particularly for the United States Navy, and Norfolk serves as the home for the most important of these regional installations, Naval Station Norfolk. Located on Sewell's Point Peninsula, in the northwest corner of the city, the installation is the current headquarters of the Atlantic Fleet, as well as being home port for the 2nd Fleet, which compromises approximately 62,000 active duty personnel, 75 ships, and 132 aircraft. Norfolk is also home to Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads, the headquarters to the Allied Command Transformation (NATO) and the United States Joint Forces Command. The region also plays an important role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk include: BAE Systems Ship Repair, Colonna's Shipyard, and NASSCO. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. When combined with other important regional military installations such as Naval Air Station Oceana, Norfolk Naval Shipyard (in Portsmouth), Langley Air Force Base, and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, and along with other important defense contractors, the military serves as the region's economic backbone and cultural focal point. It is estimated that over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News- Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.http://www.odu.edu/bpa/forecasting/2004chapter1.pdf Commercial ports After the military, the 2nd largest and most important industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and is the location of the world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the 3 terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the 2nd* busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey. In addition, just across the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, Maersk is spending $450 million to open the largest container terminal on the East Coast sometime in late 2007. In addition to NIT, Norfolk is home to Lambert's Point Docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere, with annual throughput of approximately 48 million tons. Bituminous coal is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The coal is loaded onto trains and sent to the port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia primarily. Most major shipping lines have a permanent presence in the region with some combination of sales, distribution, and/or logistical offices, many of which are located in Norfolk. In addition, many of the largest international shipping companies have chosen Norfolk as their North American headquarters. These companies are either located at the Norfolk World Trade Center building or have constructed buildings in the Lake Wright Executive Center office park. Among them include: *CMA CGM - The French firm and world's 3rd largest shipping line has its North American headquarters in Norfolk. *Zim Integrated Shipping Services - An Israeli owned shipping line and the 13th largest in the world, also has its North American headquarters in Norfolk. *Maersk Line Limited - A subsidiary of the world's largest shipping line, A.P. Moller- Maersk Group, specializing in US government shipping contracts. Tourism Though Virginia Beach and Williamsburg have traditionally been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk and the construction of a cruise ship pier at the foot of Nauticus in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier. Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years. Unlike most cruise ship terminals which are located in industrial areas, the downtown location of Norfolk's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city's hotels, restaurants, shopping, and cultural amenities.

He was appointed Traffic Manager for the London to Brighton Line in 1869 and General Manager the following year. He did a great deal to improve the quality of railway travel on the railway, introducing the Westinghouse air brake, safer carriages with communication cords, electric lighting, and Pullman cars.Illustrated London News, (August 21, 1886) 204, He and his wife, Elizabeth, had five sons and the eldest founded J P Knight Ltd., tug boat operators. Knight died in 1886 and the Prince of Wales had a special wreath placed on his coffin during the funeral.City of Westminster green plaques He is buried in Brompton Cemetery in London. Invention of traffic lights In 1866, a year in which 1,102 people were killed and 1,334 injured on roads in London, Knight proposed a signalling system to regulate the horse-drawn traffic and reduce the number of road accidents. Knight's invention was operated by a policeman and used a semaphore, system based on railway signalling, during the day and red and green gas-powered lamps at night. The world's first traffic light was installed on 9 December 1868 in London near Westminster Bridge, at the intersection of Great George Street and Bridge Street, London SW1. However, in 1869, a gas leak caused one of the lights to explode, badly injuring the policeman operating it, and the system fell out of favour and was removed as a result. Traffic lights did not appear again in the UK until 1929, when the first electric signals were introduced in London. A memorial plaque to Knight's invention can be seen at 12 Bridge Street, Westminster, the corner building close to where the original traffic lights were erected. Minister for Roads and Road Safety Baroness Hayman unveiled the plaque on 4 March 1998. References External links * *John Peake Knight plaque at Plaques of London.

Born to a royal bloodline, he grew up at a time when, part of the country was occupied by invaders from the Chola Kingdom or Empire of Southern India. He assumed rulership of the Ruhuna principality in the southern parts of the country in 1055. Following a seventeen-year-long campaign, he successfully drove the Chola out of the island in 1070, \\"In their expulsion from the island\\" reuniting the country for the first time in over a century. During his reign, he re-established Buddhism in Sri Lanka and repaired much of the damage caused to infrastructure during the wars. He offered the Thihoshin Pagoda(Lord of Sri Lanka Buddha image) to Burma king Alaungsithu and it is now still in Pakokku. Early life Vijayabahu was born around 1039, by the name of Kitti (Keethi) in Ruhuna principality, the southern part of the country. He was the son of King Moggallana, a ruler of Ruhuna and Queen Lokitha. North part of Sri Lanka was occupied by Chola invaders from South India, central Sri Lanka 'Malay Rata' and Southern Sri Lanka 'Ruhuna' or 'Ruhunu Rata' was controlled by Sinhala Kings who resisting the invaders. When he was fifteen years old Kitti defeated the last of such rulers, Lokissara, with the aim of becoming the king of Ruhuna. Subsequently, in 1055, he became king of Ruhuna and attained the name of Vijayabahu. According to the \\"Panakaduwa Thamba Sannasa\\" (Panakaduwa inscription which written on copper sheets about the gifts, offerings and given by King Vijayabahu I to his higher military officer) King Vijayabahu I's own words says that Prince Kiththi and King Moggallana's whole family was under the protection of \\"Budalna\\" (Buddha Raja Naga) and he provided a great support to the king to make the country under the same flag. The Chola army frequently attacked Vijayabahu's troops in Ruhuna. However, he managed to free Ruhuna from the Cholas by 1058 and take it under his complete control. First attempt to capture Polonnaruwa After securing Ruhuna, his intention was to capture Polonnaruwa, the capital of the country. In 1066, he launched the first attack on Polonnaruwa, and captured and held the city for a brief time. However, after receiving reinforcements from South India, the strengthened Chola army attacked again, forcing Vijayabahu to flee.Prince Kurukulattaraiyan, Vijayabahu the Great's commander: The Karava of Ceylon, M.D.Raghavan, p.9-10 He established himself in Wakirigala after this and concentrated on organizing his army for a fresh attempt to capture Polonnaruwa. During this time, he also had to face rebellions from other Sinhala leaders fighting for the throne. Overcoming these rebellions, Vijayabahu continued to muster his armies in order to retake the Capital, but was not strong enough to attempt another attack against the Chola army. He made Katharagama in Ruhuna as his capital and also he started to organize an army to defeat the Cholas. Second attack on Polonnaruwa Vijayabahu I sent three armies to attack Polonnaruwa. One was sent along the western shore to Mahatittha and Polonnaruwa, another from the east across Magama and the third and main force across Mahiyanga. Civil war broke out during 1069‚Äì1070 in the Chola empire in South India, throwing the country into turmoil. The concerns within India prevented the empire from focusing on Sri Lanka, providing an opportunity for Vijayabahu to attack again while the Chola forces in Polonnaruwa were more or less isolated. He has gained the support of many kingdoms to defeat the Cholas such as Burma and Pandya who also wanted to defeat Cholas in their kingdom. Starting from Mahanagakula on the south of the Walawe river, Vijayabahu dispatched three armies to attack Polonnaruwa from three fronts. One army was sent along the western shore of the country to Mahathittha port to deal with any reinforcements arriving from South India. Afterwards, part of this army moved towards Polonnaruwa and attacked from the North-west, while the other part held the ports to prevent reinforcements from arriving. A second army was sent from the east across Magama to attack Polonnaruwa from the east. The third and main force advanced across the country, led by the king. Surrounded by these three armies, Polonnaruwa was besieged for seven months before king Vijayabahu‚Äôs forces entered the city. In 1070, Vijayabahu became the ruler of Polonnaruwa. At that time Sri Lanka was known as Thambapanni. Ruling of the country After the victory at Polonnaruwa, Vijayabahu had to face more rebellions. This caused him to delay his coronation, which took place in 1072 or 1073, eighteen years after being crowned as Vijayabahu in Ruhuna and after a military campaign that lasted seventeen years. Polonnaruwa was renamed ‚ÄúVijayarajapura‚Äù and chosen as the capital, making Vijayabahu the first Sinhala king of the Polonnaruwa Kingdom. The coronation ceremony was held in a palace built for this purpose in Anuradhapura, the former capital of the country. Vijayabahu took Lilavati, the daughter of Jagatipala of Kanauj as his queen. He also married Tilokasundari, a princess from Kalinga, with the view of strengthening ties with the Kalingas. During the Chola rule and the wars, Buddhism in the country had suffered a lot and Buddhist monks were few. Five ordained monks‚Äînecessary for the upasampada (ordination) of Buddhist monks‚Äîcould not be found in the whole country. To re-establish Buddhism in the country, Vijayabahu sought help from King Anawrahta in Burma. As a result, ordained monks were sent from Burma to Sri Lanka. These monks helped to re-establish Buddhism by ordaining new monks and teaching the Pitaka. In addition to this, Vijayabahu also repaired several Buddhist temples that were abandoned and destroyed. A new temple was also constructed in Polonnaruwa for the keeping of the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha.The history says that the monks in both countries got together to make an acceptable version in the scriptures when the interpretation of the \\"Thripitaka\\" are different with each other. Vijayabahu also reconstructed a number of tanks in Rajarata destroyed during the wars, in addition to constructing several new tanks. This reconstruction of the irrigation system in Rajarata area was important to the development of the country since the country depended mainly on paddy cultivation. Around 1084/1085, another quarrel with the Chola kingdom erupted when some ambassadors of Vijayabahu sent to West Chalukya were harassed by them. However, the king's decision for another war against the Chola Empire caused the Velakkara mercenaries serving in Vijayabahu‚Äôs army to rebel against him. Several generals of the army were killed by the mutineers and the royal palace was burned down. Vijayabahu fled to Wakirigala again but returned to Polonnaruwa and recaptured it, suppressing the rebellion. The rebel leaders were captured and executed. Vijayabahu is also noted for constructing roads to Sri Pada and building resting places called ambalama for the benefit of the pilgrims. He also granted villages and cultivations for the service of the pilgrims and the shrine. This is recorded in the \\"Ambagamu\\" inscription which situated by the King Vijayabahu I. Vijayabahu died in 1110, having reigned as king of Sri Lanka for fifty-five years. He was then known as ‚ÄúMahalu Vijayabahu‚Äù (Vijayabahu the old) due to his age and long rule of the country. He is also commonly referred to as Maha Vijayabahu (Vijayabahu the great). The Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment of the Sri Lanka Army is named after him.

In 1951, the club received a boost when the former Maesteg RFC, Wales and British Lions scrum half Trevor Lloyd returned to Aberavon Harlequins, his original club. The 1955/56 season was the best playing record in the Quins' history, playing over thirty matches and losing only once. At the start of the 21st century, in an attempt to modernise the governing body of Welsh rugby union and to bring Wales fully into the professional era, it was decided to restructure the Welsh leagues and to source new sponsorship revenue for them. Teams would be allocated a division depending on their recent season‚Äôs order of merit and their geographical location. In the 2001/02 season, the Quins were placed in Lloyds TSB Division Two West, along with their local rivals Corus (Port Talbot) RFC.

Licensed to Sanford, North Carolina, United States, its primary market covers Lee County, Chatham County, Moore County, and Harnett County. The station is currently owned by Sandhills Broadcasting Group and is the AM sister station of WFJA. History The station is named for founding partners, Walter W. Gregory of Rocky Mount, NC, and Waldo W. Primm, also of Rocky Mount prior to moving back to Sanford, NC, to launch Sanford's first radio station, over strong opposition of the local newspaper, which failed to stop the addition of a new media outlet in Sanford. The call letters, WWGP, stand for: Winford W.(Williams) Gregory and Waldo W. Primm, the founders. W.W. Gregory died not long after WWGP began broadcasting, a serious personal loss to the Gregory and Primm families. WWGP was thought by some to represent Primm family names, Gerald Primm and Winford Primm, sons of W. W. Primm and Treva C. Primm. WWGP- AM signed on the air in 1946. It was co-owned by close friends Waldo W. Primm, manager/engineer, and Walter W. Gregory, Rocky Mount, NC, financier, for whom the call letters stand. W. W. Gregory died within the first year or two of WWGP's broadcasting launch. Mr. Primm continued to work to put the station on sound footing, selling it after nearly a decade. WWGP-AM was sold to Frank James Abbott, who eventually sold the station to its current owner Richard K. Feindel. The sale occurred on January 13, 1994 and today WWGP-AM is owned by WWGP Broadcasting, Inc. In its early years, WWGP had some local icons as announcers: Bill Buchanan, who for many years did mornings. Bill Cameron did the afternoon shift. WWGP-AM concentrated heavily on local news. Mr. Primm often offered free advertising for local merchants not accustomed to using radio marketing. He was ahead of his time, although some merchants did come to see the benefits of continuing as paying advertisers.Jean Primm Purcell, daughter of W.W. Primm, co-founder of W W G P For many years Frank James \\"Bud\\" Abbott did local news. He passed the reigns to Joan Merritts, who was a graduate of CCTI, now CCCC's Radio TV Broadcasting curriculum and she, upon retirement, Margaret Murchison became news director in 1979. She recently celebrated 30 years in the news broadcasting industry. Also after the noon newscast, Abbott had syndicated columnist \\"Drew Pearson\\" air his five-minute editorial and when Pearson died in 1969, his partner in political crime, \\"Jack Anderson\\" aired his political commentary until his death in 2005. WWGP-AM carried \\"Paul Harvey News and Comment\\" at 8:30AM,\\"Paul Harvey: The Midday Report\\" at 12:30PM and \\"Paul Harvey's The Rest of the Story in the late afternoon. Harvey died in early 2009. WWGP-AM also airs ABC Sports. The station broadcasts a mix of local and satellite fed broadcasts. The satellite feeds originate from ABC Radio studios in Dallas, Texas and the station carries the \\"Today's Best Country\\" format from ABC. On the local end of things, the morning show \\"The Swap Shop\\" is live. Callers list items to buy, sell, or trade from 8:00am ‚Äì 12:00pm Monday through Saturday. The Swap Shop was originally hosted by Blair Cameron, a 1977 graduate of the Radio TV Broadcasting program at CCTI, under Jerry Farmer's instruction. Dr. Anthony Harrington was one of his classmates, and a graduate of the CCTI Radio/TV broadcasting curriculum as well. Cameron had hosted the swap shop at WWGP's cross-town rival station WEYE, starting in 1978, years before taking on morning show duties at WWGP in 1986. The \\"Swap Shop\\" started as a 30-minute program, which only lasted one day, before growing into a multi-hour show. He was the morning show and swap shop host for ten years, before leaving in 1996. Brian Lee (aka Brian Ek) took the show to a total of 4 hours each day during the week and was the show host for 9 years, followed by Steve Gordon who left the show on August 3, 2012. Since Gordon's departure, the show is being temporarily hosted by a guest host until a permanent replacement is named. During \\"The Swap Shop\\" Margaret Murchison airs local news updates each hour. WWGP-AM carries news from the \\"American Information Radio Network\\" of ABC at the top of each hour. Richard K. Feindel, owner of WWGP died on November 24, 2015, at the age of 70, one day after undergoing heart surgery in Durham, NC. According to the Sanford Herald Newspaper of February 6, 2019 WWGP and WFJA have been sold by Susan Feindel to Sandhills Broadcasting Group with principal owner Jon Hockaday as the buyer.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2007 to 2018 who represented the riding of Ottawa Centre. He was President of the Ontario Liberal Party and served in several cabinet positions in the government of Kathleen Wynne, including as Attorney General. Background Naqvi was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan and immigrated to Canada with his family in 1988 at the age of 15. Naqvi settled in the Niagara Falls, Ontario-area and attended McMaster University and the University of Ottawa Law School. He was called to the Bar in Ontario in 2001 and began practising in international trade law at Lang Michener LLP, eventually becoming a partner. He left Lang Michener in 2007 to join the Centre for Trade Policy and Law at Carleton University. He was President of the Liberal Party of Ontario. The Ottawa Citizen named Naqvi as one of its \\"People to Watch in 2010\\", with a profile in the 9 January 2010 Saturday Observer headlined \\"Yasir Naqvi, he's a firecracker\\". Ottawa Life magazine also included him in its Tenth Annual \\"Top 50 People in the Capital\\" list for 2010. In a September 2011 column, Adam Radwanski of The Globe and Mail called Naqvi \\"possibly the hardest-working constituency MPP in the province.\\" Prior to entering politics he volunteered with a number of community associations including the Centretown Community Health Centre and the Ottawa Food Bank. Politics Naqvi ran in the 2007 provincial election as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa Centre. He defeated NDP candidate Will Murray by 2,094 votes. He was re-elected in 2011 and 2014. He was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to Rick Bartolucci, the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, in the cabinet announcement of 30 October 2007. On 3 October 2008, he was named Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Revenue Dwight Duncan. On 24 June 2009 a cabinet shuffle moved John Wilkinson into the role of Minister of Revenue and Naqvi was kept on as his Parliamentary Assistant. On 2 September 2010 Naqvi was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to Minister of Education Leona Dombrowsky. Naqvi introduced six Private Member's Bills - the \\"Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act\\", the \\"City of Ottawa Amendment Act\\", the \\"Escaping Domestic Violence Act\\", the \\"College and University Student Associations Act, the \\"Enhancing Red Light Camera System Enforcement Act\\", and the \\"Protection of Public Participation Act\\". Parts of the City of Ottawa Amendment Act were passed as part of the 2010 budget and parts of the Escaping Domestic Violence Act were passed in March 2016 as part of the Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act. On 17 September 2009, Naqvi introduced a co-sponsored notion with NDP member France G√©linas declaring the third week of February \\"Kindness Week\\", inspired by a successful Kindness Week initiative underway in Ottawa. Naqvi also co- sponsored Toby's Act with NDP MPP France Gelinas and PC MPP Christine Elliott which added gender identity and gender expression to the Ontario Human Rights Code. In March 2013, an article appeared in the Toronto Sun which claimed that Naqvi had endorsed an Islamist book on men physically punishing their wives. The following day in the National Post, Naqvi denied having endorsed the book. The Post reported that \\"Naqvi acknowledged that he wrote a letter of support for the book two years ago, but says he didn't read it‚Ä¶. The minister says he also didn't authorize the use of his name or comments in the \\"reviews\\" section of the book.\\" In February 2013, when Kathleen Wynne took over as Premier, she appointed Naqvi to her first cabinet as Minister of Labour. After the June 2014 election, Naqvi was moved to the position of Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services and Government House Leader. On 13 June 2016 he assumed the role of Attorney General following a cabinet shuffle. Naqvi unsuccessfully sought a fourth mandate in the June 2018 Ontario general election.

It includes acute hospital trusts, ambulance trusts, mental health trusts, and the unique Isle of Wight NHS Trust. there are altogether 217 trusts, and they employ around 800,000 of the NHS's 1.2 million staff. Community health trusts present particular difficulties. Like all the trusts, they were originally established under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. They have been frequently merged, split and reorganised, sometimes combined with hospital trusts or mental health trusts. After 2001, most of them were subsumed into primary care trusts, and under the Transforming Community Services programme they were then re-established in various organisational forms, not always within the NHS. A further wave of community trusts were established between 2010 and 2013 when PCTs were abolished, sometimes reusing a previous name. All trusts are supervised by NHS Improvement, which replaced Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority in April 2016.  About the list  Many trusts have dissolved or have changed their name, and each is listed separately, under each significant name. If a trust has continued with only a slight name change, it is only listed once, with the latest name. Dates of mergers and dissolutions are generally the date of legislation; the operational date may be different. *For the distinct system of NHS Health Boards in Scotland, see NHS Scotland * For the

The Wodeyar dynasty ruled the Southern Karnataka region until Indian independence in 1947, when the kingdom was merged with the Union of India. Society Crawford Hall at Mysore University The society in the Kingdom followed age old and deeply established norms of social interaction between people in the centuries prior to the 18th century. In the 18th century, fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers. Wars between Hindu kingdoms and Sultanates continued, though the battles between native rulers (including Muslims) and the new foreigners, the British, took centre stage.Kamath (2001), p233 Social reforms in the 19th century ushered in a more flexible society which granted people of lower castes access to schools, public office and courts.Chopra et al. (2003), p179 The spread of English education, the introduction of the printing press, and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries also had a positive influence. Literature became more secular, while the fine arts such as music, drama, dance and painting saw a renaissance. The rise of modern nationalism all over India had its impact on Mysore as well. This manifested itself in two ways - a longing to preserve all that was good in past tradition and an acceptance of western influence.Kamath (2001), p278 For centuries, primary education was imparted in Agraharas and Pathashalas where Sanskrit and the local vernacular was the medium of instruction. With the arrival of Islam, instruction to Muslims in the Arabic language was given in Madrasas. With the rise of British power, the English education gained prominence. These changes were orchestrated by Lord Elphinstone, the governor of the Madras Presidency. He developed his own method which had considerable influence on the status of education in the presidency. His plan became the constitution of the central collegiate institution or University Board, which gained fruition in 1841.Chopra et al. (2003), p185 Accordingly, a high school department of the university was established. For imparting education in the interior regions, schools were raised in principal towns which eventually were elevated to college level, with each college becoming central to many Zilla schools (local schools). The language of instruction in these schools was English.Chopra et al. (2003), p186 The earliest English medium schools appeared in 1833 in Mysore and spread across the region. In 1858, the department of education was founded in Mysore and it is estimated that by 1881, there may have been 2087 English medium schools in the Mysore Kingdom. Higher education became available with the formation of Bangalore Central College (1870) and Maharajas college in Mysore (1879). The Maharanis college in Mysore (1901) and the St. Agnes college in Mangalore (1921) served women. The Mysore University was founded in 1916.Kamath (2003), p278-279 Social reforms aimed at practices such as sati, untouchability and emancipation of the lower classes swept across India and had their positive influence on Mysore territory as well.Chopra et al.

Re-marriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged by enlightened men and women of Mysore. There were uprisings against British authority in India and in the Mysore region. The first unsuccessful revolt, aided by the French, came in the Malnad region in early 1800 by a Maratha called Dhondiya Wagh who was eventually killed.Kamath (2001), p272 This event was followed by a revolt of a Zamindar Virappa in Koppal (1819),Kamath (2001), p273 the rebellion of brave queen Rani Chennamma of Kittur in 1824, by her trusted aide Sangolli Rayanna in 1829. In october 1831, the British took over the government of Mysore. They issued a proclamation severely warning the rebels against their continued operations. Then, while some insurgents surrendered and others carried on their defiant activities for some time more up to 1833.

The Mysore Amba Vilas palace opened a press in 1840 followed by a government press in Bangalore (1842). Eighty six Kannada printing presses were operating by the end of 19th century.Kamath (2003), p279 This popularised the publication of ancient Kannada classics such as Pampa Bharata by Adikavi Pampa in 1891, the Jaimini Bharata by Lakshmisa in 1848 and the Basavapurana in 1850.Kamath (2001), p280 On the same lines as the English language historicals published by British and Indian historians recording the achievements of Karnataka Empires, Alur Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada version called Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava rekindling Kannada nationalism.Kamath (2001), p281 Modern Kannada stage was popularised by the Yakshagana, the founding of a stage in Chandrasala Totti in the Mysore palace and a drama troupe in 1881. Classical English and Sanskrit plays influenced Kannada stage and produced famous dramatists such as Shirahatti Venkoba Rao and Gubbi Veeranna.Kamath (2003), p282 The public began to enjoy Carnatic music through its broadcast on public address systems set up in the palace grounds.Pranesh (2003), p163 Mysore paintings were inspired by the Bengal Renaissance paintings and produced such well-known artists as Sundarayya, Tanjavur Kondayya, Ala Singarayya, B.Venkatappa, the Raju brothers, Keshavayya and others.Kamath (2003), p283 Female poets such as Cheluvambe (the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Haridasa Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and Sanchi Honnamma (author of Hadibadeya Dharma) wrote classics in Kannada language.Pranesh (2003), pp33-34 The devadasi system that had existed in India for centuries was abolished in 1909, though a unique form of temple dancing was lost.

The facility uses manned models at a 1:25 scale on a man-made lake designed to simulate natural conditions including harbours, canals, and open seas. It was the first such facility in the world. The Centre was created in 1967 near Grenoble, France, by Laboratoire Dauphinois d'Hydraulique (now Artelia). The courses are given by former maritime pilots. Since 1967, the Centre has trained over 6 500 maritime pilots, captains and officers from all over the world. French, European, Australian, Brazilian and North American pilots make up 90% of the Centre's students. The manned model training regime is now recommended by the International Maritime Organization under Resolution A 960 (23) of December 2005. The facility was written about by John McPhee in an October, 1998 article for The Atlantic Monthly, later republished as Chapter Two in his book Uncommon Carriers (2006).  History  The centre‚Äôs origin goes back to the fifties, when Port Revel‚Äôs mother company, Sogreah, was studying bank erosion on the Suez Canal using model ships sailing on a scale model with a movable bed (i.e. granular material subjected to erosion by turbulent water movement). At the end of the sixties this experience with free sailing model ships was used by Esso to anticipate the manoeuvring behaviour of the new, much larger, oil tankers. After three years spent with Esso captains between 1967 and 1970, the Centre was taken over by Sogreah in 1970. During the 1970s, most students were captains, while the first maritime pilots came to discover the centre. In the 1990s, the first refresher courses were organised for pilots, who returned every 5 years. These courses are less directive and leave more room for customisation, which is a way of optimising port operations to increase port accessibility. Manned model shiphandling training has improved over the years because: * the instructors have become more proficient in delivering the courses and in their ability to structure courses as required, * lake facilities have undergone changes, such as the creation of extensive shallow water areas with currents, and can mimic specific port scenarios, * all kinds of large ships are available and model electronics have become more sophisticated in order to reproduce real ship manoeuvring behaviour, * tugs have become a part of the courses since 2000, providing realistic capability for berthing/unberthing operations and escort work, * pod propulsion is available since 2006, * introducing quality assurance has increased the reliability of ships and equipment, * the lake area was extended from four to five hectares during the winter 2008-2009, * a large container ship (8 500 TEU) was added to the fleet in 2009, * a large LNG carrier of 266 000 m3, the Q-Max, was added in 2010, * a Controllable-pitch propeller (CPP) was introduced in 2013, * a cruise ship (5000 people) with 2 pods and powerful bow thrusters was added in 2014.  Manned models  Manned models are small scale models that can carry and be handled by at least one person on an open expanse of water. They must behave like real ships, giving the shiphandler the same sensations. Wind, currents, waves, water depths, channels and berths must be reproduced realistically. Manned models are used for research (e.g. ship behaviour), engineering (e.g. port layout) and for training in shiphandling (e.g. maritime pilots, masters and officers). They are usually at 1:25 scale. The aim of training on manned models is to enable seamen to acquire or to develop manoeuvring skills through a better understanding of a ship‚Äôs behaviour as it sails in restricted water conditions at manoeuvring speed. Manned models are considered by ships' captains and maritime pilots as the next best thing to a full-scale prototype for understanding a ship's behaviour. Training on the scale models provides experience that could never be gained on real ships for the simple reason that neither ship-owners nor local authorities would allow such risks to be taken. Scale models allow the shiphandler to make mistakes. Scale models allow experimentation on ship behaviour to explore unknown fields beyond the limits of safety. Periodic training on scale models will maintain shiphandling skills at their highest level and periodic evaluations will show it. Those who have trained on both claim that scale models are complementary to computer simulators. While manoeuvres with currents, waves, tugs, anchors, bank effects, etc. are reproduced more accurately on scale models, numerical simulators are more realistic when it comes to the bridge environment. In an ideal world, shiphandling training would consist of three things: : :1. Training on board real ships: the environment is obviously realistic, but the time spent and the acceptable risks are limited. : :2. Training on manned models: manoeuvres can be pushed beyond the safety limits and ships sail on real water, but there is limited reproduction of the captain‚Äôs vision and of wind conditions. : :3. Training on numerical simulators: the water and ships are simply equations, but the bridge and 360¬∞ vision are realistic enough to simulate Bridge Team Management and crisis management.  Lake  The 5 hectare lake is located in the lower Alps near Grenoble where the wind regime is very mild. Moreover, it is sheltered by a forest. Hence uncontrolled wind effects on ships are minimised. At 1:25 scale, the lake area represents a navigable zone of about 5 by 2 nautical miles, allowing several models to sail at the same time at normal manoeuvring speeds and to berth at one of the 50 berths and piers. Shallow and very shallow water areas (less than 10% under keel-clearance for certain ships) are to be found on about 50% of the lake area. The lake is fitted with wave, current and wind generators and complex port approach configurations. Around 40% of the lake is subjected to currents.  Fleet  The model ships are all at 1:25 scale. There are 11 ships and 4 tugs. All ships are equipped with indicators giving rudder angle, engine speed, ship speed, wind speed, etc. Most of the ships are equipped with bow and stern thrusters and anchors. Five ships are equipped with a DGPS tracking system. Training with special features like Becker rudder, Schilling rudder, CPP is available. See similitude of ship models for details of the scaling factors involved.  References  * IMPA, 2014 - IMPA on Pilotage - pp161-169 * John Mc Phee, 2006 - Uncommon Carriers - pp43-65 * Michel R.

He was born in Silvia, in the department of Cauca, December 14, 1825 and died in Popay√°n, September 4, 1890. His parents were Nicolas Hurtado and Maria Trinidad Hurtado. He went to school at Colegio San Jose and then studied law at the University of Cauca, where he graduated on January 27, 1852. He subsequently became a University lecturer in law. His initial military involvement was in 1851, in defence of legal institutions. Two years later his military and political career started in earnest with the Colombian Liberal Party in the fight against the dictator Jose Maria Melo. From 1860 he took part in revolutionary movements against the Conservative Government of Mariano Ospina Rodriguez. He joined the army of General Thomas Cipriano de Mosquera which was successful in 1861, and he was promoted to the rank of General. Subsequently he was part of the Cauca Assembly and served as a government minister on various occasions. He also took part in the Convention of Rionegro which produced the 1863 Constitution. In 1868 he was elected as a Parliamentary representative and then a Senator. In 1878 President Julian Trujillo Largacha appointed him Minister of War and Navy, and a year later he was elected Governor of the Sovereign State of Cauca (1879‚Äì1883). Hurtado's elevation was due to the \\"April Revolution\\" (1879), led by Generals Eliseo Payan and Juan de Dios Ulloa, who represented a coalition of independents and \\"mosqueristas\\" who opposed the abuses committed by radicals. Leaving office in 1883, he was elected by Congress to be the Designated President of the Republic and was appointed Presiding Judge by the Supreme Court of Justice. He exercised presidential power between April and August 1884, due to the delay of Rafael Nu√±ez assuming power. In his responsibilities he appointed as cabinet ministers of Housing, Finance, Public Works, External Relations, Public Education and War the following: Manuel M. Castro, Felipe Angulo, Mariano Tanco y Jos√© Mar√≠a Caro, Jos√© J. Vargas, Eustorgio Salazar, Napole√≥n Borrero and Jos√© Mar√≠a Campo Serrano. When he left the Presidency he campaigned against the Nu√±ez's Regeneration project of, and in the war of 1885 he was taken prisoner and suffered harsh treatment. He was subsequently exiled to Costa Rica (Central America), but in 1889, shortly before his death, was allowed to return to Colombia. His remains are now in the Panteon de los Proceres Cemetery in Popay√°n (Cauca). This burial ground was inaugurated by Guillermo Le√≥n Valencia in 1940.

Early life and education  Besosa was born on October 26, 1949 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the oldest son of Frank A. Besosa and Augusta V. (Tuty) Stubbe. He attended primary schools in San Juan, and graduated in 1967 from the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut. He then attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, receiving an Artium Baccalaureus degree with a concentration in History in 1971. After college, because he had a very low draft number (7), he enlisted in the United States Army under the college option program to attend Officer Candidate School. In April, 1972, he graduated from the 23-week course of the United States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School in Fort Benning, Georgia, and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Military Intelligence Branch. After completing the Counterintelligence Officer and Personnel Security Adjudications courses at the United States Army Intelligence Center and School in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, he was posted to Detachment R, 500th Military Intelligence Group in Okinawa, Japan, where he served as Deputy Chief of the detachment's counterintelligence field office until 1974. Besosa was then reassigned as the Assistant S-2 (Intelligence and Security Officer) of the 313th Military Intelligence Battalion in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. When the 504th Military Intelligence Group was activated in Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Georgia, Besosa was assigned as the Group's S-2, with the additional duty of the Group's Race Relations/Equal Opportunity Officer. In 1976, he was honorably discharged as a Captain, and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal. In March, 2007, Besosa was elected to the Infantry Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame. Once discharged from the Army, Besosa attended Georgetown University Law Center, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1979.

Aurelius Heraclianus (died 268) was a Roman soldier who rose to the rank of Praetorian Prefect in the latter part of the reign of the Emperor Gallienus. He was a member of the cabal of senior commanders of the Imperial field army that plotted and achieved the assassination of the Emperor Gallienus. His subsequent fate is uncertain. The only ancient reference has him committing suicide, but the circumstances are unclear.  Biography  =Origins= Heraclianus's praenomen is nowhere cited in the sources. It was not uncommon by the mid-Third Century for boys not to be given one. His nomen (i.e. 'Aurelius') was that commonly adopted by families admitted to Roman citizenship by Caracalla under the provisions of that Emperor's law known as the Constitutio Antoniniana. This came into force in 213 AD - i.e. probably the time around which Heraclianus was born. His place of birth was most likely Thracia in the eastern Balkans. This supposition is suggested by an inscription dedicated to Heraclianus by a fellow-soldier, Traianus Mucianus (possibly a cliens of Heraclianus's family) that was discovered at the site of Mucianus's own hometown of Augusta Traiana in that province - now Stara Zagora in Bulgaria.G. Mihailov, Inscriptiones Graecae in Bulgaria Repertae 3.2.1568 (Heraclianus) A second memorial found in Stara Zagora, also by Traianus Mucianus, dedicated to Heraclianus's brother, Marcus Aurelius Apollinarius,G. Mihailov, op.cit3.2.1569 (Apollinarius). who was an equestrian governor of Thrace, reinforces the notion that Heraclianus had strong family connections in that region and was most likely a citizen of Augusta Traiana. Heraclianus's later association with Claudius Gothicus and Aurelian in the assassination of Gallienus - see below - also suggests that he had connections with the Illyrian clans that dominated the officer cadres of the Balkan garrisons in the 3rd Century AD. =Career= Heraclianus rose to prominence during the troubled reign of the Emperor Gallienus becoming Praetorian PrefectBoth Zonaras and Zosimus give him this title. It is omitted in the Vita Gallieni in the Augustan History. See Zosimus i. 40; Zonaras xxii. 25; and Vita Gallieni 14. The Greek version of the title appears in Mucianus's inscription. ‚Äì an office of state that combined the command of the Emperor's Praetorian Guard and principal ministry.Howe (cf) suggests that in the troubled reign of Gallienus the military aspects of this office came to the fore, a conclusion indicated by the fact that those known to have been appointed to it were career soldiers rather than jurists or statesmen as in the late second century () Heraclianus probably became Praetorian Prefect in 267 following the appointment of Lucius Petronius Taurus Volusianus, the former Praetorian Prefect, as Urban Prefect - i.e. Imperial Governor of Rome - in that year. Heraclianus was thus likely to have been a highly competent soldier who was either born into the Illyrian military √©lite or earned a place in their ranks by his behaviour in Gallienus's many wars against barbarian invaders and would-be usurpers.John of Antioch states that Heraclianus was Master of the Dalmatian Horse at the time of Gallienus's assassination. The other sources are to be preferred regarding his status then, but he might well have held this post earlier in his career. The Vita GallieniSee Vita Gallieni 13.4 also asserts that he was the leader (Dux) of a force sent by Gallienus to the East to reassert imperial authority in the region after the death (assassination?) of Odenathus of Palmyra in 267, but was defeated and his army destroyed - presumably by Zenobia. This is the only ancient reference to such an attempt being made in Gallienus's reign and the usual caveat regarding the reliability of the Historia Augusta as a historical record must apply.The Vita Gallieni says that he was sent to deal with the Persians rather than Palmyra, but by SHA standards this is only a mild confusion Alf√∂ldi suggests that Gallienus may have attempted to assert his authority in Asia if not in Syria and Mesopotamia after the death of Odenathus (vis-a-vis Palmyra not Persia), but the effort was negated by the barbarian invasions of the eastern Balkans of the final year of his reign. However, Alf√∂ldi does not believe that Rome and Palmyra actually engaged in hostilities as the Historia Augusta suggests. Bray is inclined to dismiss any notion of an expedition in 267-8. This is also the conclusion of David Potter. However, Prof. Potter does make the interesting suggestion that Heraclianus might have made an expedition to the East to reassert Roman authority in the Asian provinces not in 267 - when he was almost certainly engaged in the Gothic war - but at the behest of Gallienus's murderer and successor, the Emperor Claudius Gothicus, in 270.In \\"The Roman Empire at Bay\\" - see Sources below - Potter makes this suggestion as a tentative thesis. However,in his later work \\"The Transformation of the Empire: 235-337 CE\\" he seems to regard the possible intervention under Claudius II as an established fact. This effort might either have been undertaken in response to aggression of Zenobia of Palmyra in Arabia and Egypt in that yearSee Alf√∂ldi, Op.Cit. or have been the cause of that aggression. =Downfall= Whether or not he was sent to the East in 267, it is likely that Heraclianus returned to Europe in time to take part in Gallienus's campaign against the Goths and Heruls in the Balkans in 267-8. The ancient sources are generally agreed that he was with Gallienus when the Emperor chose to abandon operations against these invaders and hurry to Italy when Aureolus launched his rebellion on behalf of the 'Gallic Emperor', Postumus, in Mediolanium and he was also a member of the triumvirate of senior officers who brought about Gallienus's assassination. The cause(s) of the murderous displeasure of Heraclianus and his colleagues with Gallienus are unknowable. For a discussion of their possible issues with their Emperor see Bray.Bray, Op. Cit., Chapter XXI. Whatever Heraclianus's motives he does not seem to have benefited from his treason. His death by suicide may have followed soon afterwards.Zonaras 12, 25 If Potter's thesis - see above - is correct and he did live on to serve under Claudius II a spectacular failure in Asia might explain why he chose to take his own life. However, it is unlikely that the circumstances of his death will ever be revealed.

(New York: Oxford University Press, 1982) Along with Francisco Moncion, Maria Tallchief, and Tanaquil Le Clercq, Magallanes was among the core group of dancers with which George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein formed Ballet Society, the immediate predecessor of the New York City Ballet.Lynn Garafola with Eric Foner, eds. Dance for a City: Fifty Years of the New York City Ballet (New York: Columbia University Press, 1999). Early life and training Magallanes was born in Santa Rosalia de Camargo, now known as Camargo City, in the eastern part of the Mexican state of Chihuahua. He moved with his parents to the United States when he was five years old, first to New Jersey and then to the Lower East Side of New York City. When he was sixteen years old, he was spotted at the New York Boys' Club on East Tenth Street by Pavel Tchelitchev, who recommended him to Lincoln Kirstein as a scholarship student at the fledgling School of American Ballet.Larry Kaplan and Maria Tallchief, Maria Tallchief: America's Prima Ballerina (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2003) A handsome youth, with dark Latin looks and a strong, muscular physique, he auditioned for Balanchine and was accepted into the school in 1938. Under the tutelage of Balanchine and Pierre Vladimiroff, he soon began to show promise as a performer. He first appeared on stage in American Ballet Caravan's production of A Thousand Times Neigh, a tribute to the automobile, at the Ford pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Thus began his lifelong association with the enterprises of Balanchine and Kirstein.Anne Murphy, \\"Magallanes, Nicholas,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).

Balanchine had choreographed the grand pas de deux for Tallchief and Andr√© Eglevsky, but at the eleventh hour Eglevsky injured his ankle and was unable to perform. With no understudy on standby, Magallanes learned the technically challenging part in one day's rehearsal and danced the Cavalier of the Sugar Plum Fairy.Kaplan and Tallchief, Maria Tallchief: America's Prima Ballerina (2003).Murphy, \\"Magallanes, Nicholas' in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998).

Legacy In 2013, Magallanes figured as a character in Nikolai and the Others, a play by Richard Nelson produced by the Lincoln Center Theater and presented at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in New York. Depicting a gathering of Russian √©emigr√© artists in the 1940s, the play includes a scene in which Balanchine choreographs Orpheus on Magallanes and Tallchief as Stravinsky looks on. Magallanes and Tallchief were played by Michael Rosen and Natalia Alonso; Balanchine was portrayed by Michael Cerveris. The play had a short run and was not a critical success.Ben Brantley, \\"Famous Russian House Guests, with Plenty of Baggage,\\" review of Nikolai and the Others, by Richard Nelson, New York Times, May 6, 2013.

The word is usually, but not exclusively, applied to marine mollusks, although in addition, numerous species of land snails and freshwater mollusks also reach adult size at very small dimensions. These tiny mollusks or their tiny shells are easy to overlook, as many of them are not very noticeable to the naked eye, and thus many people are not aware that they even exist. Nonetheless there are large numbers of families and vast numbers of mollusk species, in particular marine gastropods or sea snails, which are minute enough to be considered micromollusks. Considerable numbers of marine gastropod species are only about 5 or 6 mm in adult size; many others are only about 2 or 3 mm in adult size; and a few have adult shells which are as small as one millimeter or even smaller still. Despite their tiny size, many of the shells have a good deal of elaborate sculpture. A fair number of them are even quite colorful, although many others are colorless and translucent. Certain species of micromollusks are very common in the right habitat, and can on occasion be present in huge numbers. However, because of their minute size, micromollusks often go unnoticed by beachcombers, shell collectors and even more serious conchologists. Micromollusks are not very popular as a subject of study, even among professional malacologists, primarily because these minute species can be very challenging to work with. It can often require great care, patience and persistence to find micromollusks, sort them, store them, and identify them correctly. Working with them usually also requires special techniques and special equipment compared with that needed for most of the larger shelled species. Discriminating the features necessary for successful identification of micromollusks to the species level almost always requires a stereo or dissecting microscope. Identifying, or adequately photographing, the smallest species may sometimes require a scanning electron microscope. Access to a first rate scientific research library is also often necessary, since many of the popular shell identification books and field guides either omit micromollusks completely, or only include a very few species for any particular area. Because of all these various challenges, micromollusks are poorly known compared to their larger relatives, and thus there are undoubtedly numerous species which have yet to be discovered and described. Shells of some micromollusks: from left, Truncatella bahamensis (holotype), Truncatella bilabiata bilabiata, Truncatella pulchella.Ross L. T.

Retrieved on September 2007. Defining the size There is currently no universally acceptable definition for the upper limit of the size range for micromollusks. Because of this, the exact use of the word varies from one expert to another; however, the maximum size of the shell of a micromollusk species is usually 5 mm to 7 mm, around one quarter of an inch or less. The shells of the very smallest micromollusks are less than one millimeter in adult size, and thus they are truly microscopic, smaller in fact than some sand grains. Many other micromollusks are from 2 to 4 mm in maximum size; even for people with small hands, this means that the shells are far too small to be picked up with the fingers using the normal grasping action. Techniques used Micromollusks are most often found by the careful searching of sediment samples which have been taken from \\"promising-looking\\" areas. Once sediment samples are clean and dry, they are searched under the microscope. Minute shells are picked out using a very small sable-hair paintbrush which has been dampened at the tip. Soft entomological tweezers are also sometimes used. Shells this small are usually stored in small glass vials, or in paper micromounts. =Marine sampling= For dead shells of marine species on sandy beaches, these minute empty shells wash up in the lightest deposits of beach drift, in more sheltered areas where the very smallest particles of detritus are left behind by the retreating tide; this is often in a rather flat and level part of the beach. When at least some minute shells are seen on close visual inspection, a sediment sample taken at that spot may contain many more. Underwater in a marine context, for example when scuba diving, a sediment sample is often taken from areas such as the surface layer of sand under rocks, or at the edge of a coral reef. Live micromollusks are also found by washing seaweeds or algae in fresh water in a bucket. =Non-marine sampling= Land micromollusks are often found by taking samples of leaf litter from rich areas, subsequently sieving or sifting the litter, and then searching it under a strong light and magnification. Freshwater micromollusks which live on aquatic plants are often collected by passing a plankton net vigorously through and around water weeds so that minute mollusks end up falling into the glass tube at the end of the net. Small bottom- dwelling micromollusks such as Pisidium species are found by scooping a bottom sample of mud into a fine meshed long-handled net, and then agitating it and moving it through the water repeatedly, until only solid particles remain in the net. Because most empty land snail shells and many empty freshwater shells float, another effective way to sample dead shells from an area can be to sort through river drift, the accumulations of small floating bits and pieces left behind by creeks and rivers after floods. Excluded from the category Juveniles or larval stages of larger species of mollusk are not considered to be micromollusks, even though these immature shells may sometimes be very small indeed, and may often be encountered in the same sediment samples where micromollusks are found. Examples The Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum exhibit about micromollusks shows some species from Sanibel, Florida The word \\"micromollusk\\" is used most often for marine shelled species, although a reasonable number of land and freshwater species are also small enough to qualify as micromollusks: for example, the land snail family Punctidae and the majority of species in the freshwater bivalve genus Pisidium. Numerous families of marine gastropods are composed entirely, or almost entirely, of minute species: * Aclididae * Assimineidae * Caecidae * Cerithiopsidae * Cingulopsidae * Elachisinidae * Eulimidae * Falsicingulidae * Fossariidae * Iravadiidae * Juliidae, the bivalved gastropods * Limacinidae * Litiopidae * Mathildidae * Obtortionidae * Omalogyridae, the smallest known gastropods, all species are less than 1 mm in adult size * Orbitestellidae * Peraclidae * Pyramidellidae * Retusidae * Ringiculidae * Rissoellidae * Rissoidae * Scaliolidae * Scissurellidae * Skeneidae * Skeneopsidae * Tornidae * Triphoridae * Truncatellidae * Vanikoridae Also see: * Acteonidae * Acteonoidea * Barleeia and others in the Barleeiidae Fresh water and land species: * Hydrobiidae (a freshwater family) * Truncatella * Pisidium in the family Sphaeriidae, freshwater bivalves References Further reading * Geiger D.

Later versions of the Crew included \\"brothers\\" Ole Anderson and Arn Anderson, (Arn at other times was a cousin or a nephew) in various combinations with the original two. In total, the four original Andersons won over 11 different tag team championships across the country. Several modern tag teams have taken names similar to the Minnesota Wrecking Crew as an homage to the group. In the 1980s, Ole and Arn allied themselves with Ric Flair, a Minnesota native who they claimed was another cousin of the family, and formed the famous wrestling stable The Four Horsemen. The stable was a major influence on professional wrestling in North America, creating the blueprint for future groups such as the New World Order, Triple Threat, and Evolution. Flair's sons David and Reid (the latter now deceased), as well as his daughter Ashley who wrestles in WWE as Charlotte Flair, can be counted as part of the family by extension. Other wrestlers claiming the Anderson heritage popped up on the independent circuit in the 1990s. These include C.W.

It was intended as a survival aid to be used after landings and before recovery in the Siberian wilderness.  Features  The pistol could be used for hunting, to defend against predators and for visible and audible distress signals. The detachable buttstock was also a machete that came with a canvas sheath. The upper two shotgun barrels used 12.5√ó70 mm ammunition (40 gauge), and the lower rifled barrel used 5.45√ó39mm ammunition developed for the AK-74 assault rifle. The TP-82 had a large lever on the left side of the receiver that opens the action, and a small grip- safety under the trigger-guard that resembled a secondary trigger.  History  The TP-82 was the result of cosmonaut Alexei Leonov's concerns after being stranded in the Siberian wilderness when his Voskhod capsule malfunctioned. He feared that the 9mm pistol that was provided in the survival kit would be ineffective against the Siberian wildlife, namely bears and wolves. TP-82s were carried regularly on Soviet and Russian space missions from 1986 to 2007.

Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court spelled out standards for \\"effectiveness\\" in the constitutional right to legal counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.. Previously the court had determined that the Sixth Amendment included the right to \\"effective assistance\\" of legal counsel, but it did not specify what constitutes \\"effective\\", thus leaving the standards for effectiveness vague. In Wiggins v. Smith, the court set forth the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases Guideline 11.8.6.(1989), as a specific guideline by which to measure effectiveness and competence of legal counsel. In Strickland v. Washington,. the Supreme Court set forth the factors the defendant must establish to demonstrate that counsel was ineffective. First, it must be shown that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable competence, and second, if counsel had not been competent, that the trial outcome would likely have been different had the counsel been competent. Background On September 17, 1988, a woman was found dead in her bathtub, with signs of sexual assault and her apartment ransacked. Defendant Wiggins had been painting at her apartment building and was seen conversing with her on September 15. That same evening he went shopping with the victim's credit cards and took some of her jewelry to a pawnbroker. Four days later, Wiggins was arrested while driving the victim's car. Wiggins was found guilty of capital murder after a bench trial. After the trial, Wiggins elected to have a jury decide the sentence on the murder conviction. Counsel's investigation of Wiggins' background was rudimentary and contained only a superficial knowledge of his history from a few sources, omitting the information in detailed social service reports of severe physical and sexual abuse. The record of the sentencing proceedings suggests that counsels' failure to investigate the defendant's background stemmed from inattention, not strategic judgment. Counsel failed to follow the American Bar Association guidelines in not gathering all such information. Counsel said they had been intent on proving the defendant did not kill the victim with his own hand and had not prepared for the sentencing phase. Counsel presented no mitigating evidence to the jury at the sentencing phase. The jury concluded that the defendant was a principal in the first degree murder of the victim and sentenced Wiggins to death. Wiggins obtained new counsel and sought post conviction relief on the grounds that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his dysfunctional background. He presented expert testimony by a forensic mental health specialist who described his personal history including the severe physical and sexual abuse he had endured and its effect upon him. At a hearing, one of Wiggins' trial counsels testified that he had Wiggins' social services records before sentencing, and knew that it could be a mitigating factor in a capital case, but believed that the way to avoid the death penalty was to create reasonable doubt that petitioner was a principal in the first degree rather than present the mitigating factors. The state provided a post-conviction review of his case and the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's findings. Wiggins then filed for federal habeas corpus relief. The Federal District Court found that defense counsel did not provide effective assistance at sentencing. However, on appeal, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that defense counsel provided reasonable application of Strickland v. Washington (1984) standards. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court granted Wiggins' petition for certiorari. Decision The Supreme Court granted a new sentencing hearing, holding that Wiggins' Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated. Trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence such as Wiggins' personal and social history of severe physical abuse and sexual assault, and none of this information was presented at the penalty phase of trial, thus prejudicing Wiggins' defense. The Supreme Court's decision stated that such an investigation is a key component of the strategic decision regarding what, if any, mitigating evidence to present during a sentencing hearing. The Court further held that the counsel's decision in defending a client facing the death penalty must be based on a thorough investigation of all possible mitigating factors. Failing that, it must be based on competent professional judgment providing sound reasons for limiting the investigation. Significance The Supreme Court attempted to improve on the vague and generalized language in Strickland v. Washington by adding an American Bar Association Guideline 11.8.6. This guideline suggests the content of counsel's investigative efforts should contain \\"medical history, educational history, employment and training history, family and social history, prior adult and juvenile correctional experience, and religious and cultural influences.\\" This clarification allows for the presentation of psychological analysis without the presence of specific diagnosis.

Phillips was born in New Hampshire and settled near Dover, Illinois around 1830. During the war he, along with other settlers, fled their settlements in fear of Native American raids. In June 1832 Phillips returned to his cabin with six other men to retrieve some belongings. The group was attacked early one morning and Phillips was killed. Early life Elijah Phillips was born in Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire on April 11, 1809, son, and one of ten total children of Elijah Phillips. Phillips left New Hampshire for Illinois at a young age in 1830. He traveled by foot, and steamboat, passing over Lake Erie and the Erie Canal in his journey. He arrived in Illinois, where he met his friends, James G. Forristall and Sylvester Brigham, who had already established themselves and erected a log cabin.

Death When the Black Hawk War erupted between elements of the Sauk and Fox and the Illinois and Michigan Territorial Militia in 1832 settler families had fled, leaving their goods and livestock behind. Eventually, it was decided that it was safe to return to the settlement to tend to the deserted possessions. About two weeks after fleeing the site, a party of seven men, Elijah Phillips, J. Hodges, Sylvester Brigham, John L. Ament, Aaron Gunn, James G.

When the settlers awoke, Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips decided to go to his cabin, about a half mile (.8 km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents.

Manned models are small scale models that can carry and be handled by at least one person on an open expanse of water. They must behave just like real ships, giving the shiphandler the same sensations. Physical conditions such as wind, currents, waves, water depths, channels and berths must be reproduced realistically. Manned models are used for research (e.g. ship behaviour), engineering (e.g. port layout) and for training in shiphandling (e.g. maritime pilots, masters and officers). They are usually at 1:25 scale.  Similitude of manned models  Worldwide, manned model schools have chosen to apply the similitude law of William Froude (1810-1879) for its manned models. This means that gravity is considered to be preponderant over the other forces acting on the hull (viscosity, capillarity, cavitation, compressibility, etc.). The different aspects of similitude may thus be defined as follows: = Physical similitude = Similitude of shape: The model has exactly the same geometric shape as the real ship. This means that all the length (L) dimensions of the real ship are divided by the same factor, the scale factor. The designers of Port Revel chose a scale (S) of 1:25, so: S(L) = 25 (smaller, hence distance is 25 times less) In this similitude, the proportions are kept (the ratios between the various dimensions of the ship are identical). This is also the case with the block coefficient. Furthermore, the angles are a length ratio, so they are also identical to the original ones. The scale factors of the areas and volumes are deduced from this, i.e.: S2(L) = 252 = 625 S3(L) = 253 = 15 625 Similitude of mass (M): The model used for shiphandling training must not only resemble the original but also move in the same way as the original when subjected to similar forces. Consequently, the scale factor for the mass (M) and displacement is the same as that for the volumes, i.e.: S(M) = S3(L) = 253 = 15 625 Similitude of forces (F): If the external forces on the model are in similitude, like the shapes, masses and inertia, the model's movement will be in similitude. It can thus be shown that the forces (F) must be at the same scale as the masses and weights, so: S(F) = S(M) = 253 = 15 625 Similitude of speed(V): In agreement with Froude's law, the velocity scale is the square root of the length scale, so: S(V) = S1/2(L) = sqrt(25) = 5 (times slower than in real life) Similitude of time (T): Time is a distance (L) over speed (V), so: S(T) = S(L) / S(V) = S1/2(L) = sqrt(25) = 5 (times faster than in real life) Similitude of power (P): As the power P = F x V, hence S(P) = S(F) x S(V), so: S(P) = S3(L) x S1/2(L) = S7/2(L) = 257/2 = 78 125 In conclusion, by choosing a scale of 1:25 for the lengths and by complying with Froude's law, the engineers at Sogreah ‚Äì Port Revel built models 25 times smaller, operating 5 times more slowly, but as the distances are 25 times less, things occur 5 times faster. The ships are 78 125 times less powerful. = Similitude of manoeuvres = While the models must be in correct similitude, this is not enough. Other factors can affect the correct reproduction of the manoeuvres, such as the field of vision, on-board equipment and wind. * First, manoeuvres on a model require the same pilot's orders as those on a real ship. The only difference is that they are executed five times faster on the model, so there is no time to discuss them (in fact, the rate of operation is such that the captain and helmsman swap roles every hour to avoid fatigue). This encourages responses to become intuitive but based upon a pre-assessed but flexible plan. What is a crisis on Day 1 of a manned model course becomes routine by Days 3+ which has to be a good definition of training. * The captain's position gives him a true field of vision from the bridge. He gives his orders to the helmsman, who is seated in front of him and operates the wheel and engine. * Control panels show the usual information (engine speed, rudder angle, heading, log, wind speed and direction, shackles of chain lowered). This information is shown in real-life values to help the trainee forget as far as possible that he is on a scale model. * The ships are fitted with bow and stern thrusters and perfectly operational anchors. They behave like real ships from this point of view as well. * Tugs are under the captain's orders via remote control, and are handled by a real tug captain. * As far as the wind is concerned, it should be recalled that as the speed scale factor is 1 in 5, a wind of 10 knots on the lake is equivalent to a 50 knot squall in reality. Ripples on the surface of the water and the movement of leaves on the trees are therefore unreliable indicators. The wind and ship speeds displayed on the control panel are therefore very important for trainees. However, the lake is situated in a forest in a region with little wind, so that uncontrollable wind effects are minimised. 40 years' experience have shown that students quickly learn how to control the models just as they do the real ships that they are used to manoeuvring. Manned model exercises promote good situational and spatial awareness, a lack of which contributes to most accidents and incidents. Those who have trained on both claim that scale models are complementary to electronic simulators. While manoeuvres with currents, waves, tugs, anchors, bank effects, etc. are reproduced more accurately on scale models, numerical simulators are more realistic when it comes to the bridge environment.

He worked for jazz label Prestige Records during the 1950s and early-1960s. He was originally hired by founder Bob Weinstock as a photographer for the record label. He was a trail-blazing African-American, as very few recording industry executives were from minorities. He took over the supervision of recording sessions as the Prestige label's success grew. Biography His parents, Lucille and Moses Edwards were natives of Kingston, Jamaica. Edwards was born in Nassau, Bahamas while his father was on a work assignment there. Living for a short time in New York City, they returned to Kingston where they resided until eventually leaving their two sons in the care of a family member. After the death of his brother, Noel, Edwards joined his parents in New York City where they lived in Harlem and Washington Heights for many years. Edwards was educated in New York City schools, including Frederick Douglass (J.H.S.139), Stuyvesant High School and City College of New York. He studied radiography at the Jersey City Medical Center, and while working there pursued an avid interest in photography and music. Using his years of piano lessons as a background, he began creating jazz compositions in his teen years, and ultimately combined his creativity in music and photography into a very prolific and successful career. Edwards' photographic work has been displayed in New York's Lincoln Center Jazz Archives, in galleries abroad, as well as The New York Times Magazine and Photography. Edwards worked in various venues of the jazz and blues arena, beginning at Prestige Records in 1957, and moved up to the position of producer, before going on to head the Verve Records label for MGM in 1967. He became the vice-president of A&R; for Chess Records in 1970. During his career, he was also associated with MGM, Columbia, Polydor, and Impulse Records. He was one of the first African-American executives in the recording industry, but was also a noted recording producer, composer and arranger. Edwards was awarded several gold and platinum records with many outstanding artists in the jazz and blues world, including Miles Davis, George Benson, John Coltrane, Chuck Berry, Etta James, Ramsey Lewis, B.B. King, Keith Jarrett, and others. He photographed many of these artists for the album jackets of numerous recordings. Edwards received a Grammy nomination for the cast album of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical Your Arms Too Short to Box with God. Edwards died in Santa Barbara, California on January 20, 2007.

The book is a young reader, normally aimed for 4 years or older. The main character, the monster Dennis, believes that human children are under his bed and will get him as he falls asleep. His mother, however, tries to get him to go to sleep. Eventually, a human child accidentally ventures into their home cave, and both the human and Dennis discover each other, frightening both. The book was aimed at decreasing the fear of night in children by basically telling them that monsters were just as afraid of humans as humans were of monsters. The book received good reviews after it came out, with hardly any review lower than a 75% rating on any book review site. Some of the books came with an extra plush toy of Dennis with his pillow and teddy bear in each arm. An animated adaptation of the book was broadcast on September 9, 1989 as one of the ABC Weekend Specials. Plot summary = Introduction = The introduction starts the book in the setting of a small picnic of a human and his dog. The human is apparently telling the reader to not venture into the Withering Wood, a forest of trees rumored to have legendary creatures such as \\"hairy trolls, nasty gnomes, and scary pixies and fairies.\\"The Monster Bed, page 1 The book then changes setting into inside the forest, where we see a small monster named Dennis and his mother,The Monster Bed, page 3 showing that Dennis was very polite for a young monster. It describes Dennis's fear of humans, which leads to the next part of the book.The Monster Bed, page 5 =Dennis's fear of children= Dennis's mother gives Dennis his teddy bear and leaves the lights on for Dennis. Dennis screams and shouts he will not go to bed. The mother, surprised at this sudden fear of bed, asks why. Dennis explains that he is afraid of humans. He says humans will \\"creep under my monster bed while I'm asleep.\\" Dennis's mother is not convinced of her son's story and tries to persuade Dennis to fall asleep.The Monster Bed, page 7 She gives Dennis his teddy bear and also says she will not turn off the light. She begins to kiss Dennis, but Dennis reacts and bites her on the nose. Dennis's mother then promises her son that the humans won't get him. She then readies him for bed. However, Dennis concludes he will sleep under his bed so the humans will not be able to find him. =A child lost= As Dennis falls asleep, a young boy skips school and ventures into the Withering Wood to hide (presumably from his parents). He walks deep into the woods so that he comes upon Dennis's and his mother's cave. Not knowing where he is, he walks into the cave for rest. He then decides to sleep.The Monster Bed, page 15 He finds Dennis's bedroom and decides to sleep on the bed. He changes into his night clothes and begins to fall asleep.The Monster Bed, page 17 However, the boy was afraid of monsters. With the absence of his mother, he checks under the bed himself, and to his surprise, he finds Dennis. Both Dennis and the young boy run away.The Monster Bed, page 19 The book then explains not to misbehave and how it would feel if Dennis's mother would tell the reader if humans were not real.The Monster Bed, page 21 Major characters =Dennis= Dennis is a polite, green, cave-dwelling reptilian monster that resembles a Velociraptor. As the main character of the story, he has many human-like features, such as smiling,The Monster Bed, illustration on page 4 walking, and emotion.The Monster Bed, illustration on page 6 The monster has two objects he carries around with him, his teddy bear and pillow.The Monster Bed cover He is given these objects to give the reader an impression of a small child. Dennis also possesses several toys. These toys resemble the characters of another children's book, Where the Wild Things Are.On copyright page: \\"The artist gracefully acknowledges the permission granted by Maurice Sendak for the use of characters from Where the Wild Things Are, 1963 by Maurice Sendak.\\" Dennis also plays hopskotch near his cave. Dennis has a strong fear of human children. He believes that there are humans underneath his bed, just as humans believe there are monsters underneath their beds. This fear has led him into trouble with his mother (see below). He has even bitten her nose while she was about to kiss him.The Monster Bed, page 11 However, in the end, Dennis chose to sleep underneath his bed so that the children could not find him underneath there. =Dennis's mother= Dennis's mother (right) listens to Dennis (left) explain why he believes humans are under his bed and will get him as he sleeps. Dennis's mother is a larger monster than Dennis, though obviously of the same species. A caring mother, she tries to get her son, Dennis, to sleep on top of his bed and to discontinue his fear of humans. However, when Dennis refuses to sleep on top of his bed, she goes through extreme difficulties to get him to sleep. She keeps the light on, she gives Dennis his teddy bear. The mother is shown to be \\"much larger\\" than Dennis, the small monster. The mother has many human mother-like qualities, such as her purse that she is seen carrying in the beginning of the book. She tucks her child in every night,The Monster Bed, illustration on page 10 and also reads stories to him about humans.The Monster Bed, illustration on page 8 She also plays with Dennis as well. =Small child= Not much is known about the small child. On the day of Dennis's refusal to sleep, the boy had skipped school, described in the book as hooky, and had hid in the forest. However, the child soon lost his way and wandered into the cave where Dennis and the monster's mother lived. By the time he arrived at the cave, he was very tired of walking and decided to sleep in the cave. He eventually found Dennis's room, with the bed. He took his clothes off into his pajamas and then decided to go to sleep. However, with the absence of the boy's mother and his fear of monsters underneath the bed, he decided the only way to see if there were monsters was to look under the bed himself. When he gazed under the bed, he saw Dennis. Both Dennis and the boy had the same reaction; they were afraid of each other. Thus, the boy ran out of the cave and Dennis ran to his mother. It is unknown what happened to the boy after the small incident.The Monster Bed, page 23 =Other characters= There are a few other minor or secondary characters in The Monster Bed. These include: *Picnic boy, a small boy introduced at the beginning of the story, and tells the reader of the dangers of the \\"Withering Wood\\". He has presumably been into the Withering Wood, as he is seen running out of the forest with his picnic kit.The Monster Bed, illustration on page 2 He owns the white and brown dog, and can be seen eating an apple, sandwich, and other food during his picnic. *The dog, a brown and white dog that is owned by the Picnic boy. It is, like its owner, scared of the many stories about the Withering Wood. *Other children, humans that Dennis believes is under his bed. Morals The second, alternate cover of The Monster Bed. There are two major morals in The Monster Bed that can both give children two lessons. One is fear of the opposite race, such as monsters' fear of children and children's fear of monsters. The book was meant to give the impression to children that their fear was as scared of them as they were of their fear, providing comfort for the small children. It also teaches children to check under the bed themselves. Another possible moral is to teach kids not to skip school, as the small child did, and to not try to hide from your parents in areas you do not know. Reaction The book received great reviews from parents for various reasons. Some were excited their child had begun reading, and some loved the illustrations, plot, and characters. Others liked it because it appealed to their children and because it had an unusual twist on children's fear of monsters. The book received a 4.5 rating at Amazon.com, and a 4/5 on Circle Time book reviews.  Style  The Monster Bed is not unusual in its writing style and illustration style. The book was written by Jeanne Willis.The Monster Bed, copyright page The style of the writing is in the format of a poem, with the first and second lines rhyming and the third and fourth rhyming, such as \\"He took off his pillows and blankets and said, / 'From now on, I plan to sleep under my bed. / If I'm underneath and a human comes near, / It won't think to look for me, safe under here.'\\"The Monster Bed, page 13 There is mostly four lines per page, though some pages have six, and one page has only a single line.Page 11 of The Monster Bed has six lines; Page 21 has one line The illustrations were created by Susan Varley using watercolor and pencil. The illustrations give the reader the impression that both Dennis and his mother are just like humans. Susan Varley even added a small easter egg to her illustrations--a closer look at Dennis's many toys everywhere in the house reveals that they are the same creatures as seen in Where the Wild Things Are.  Plush toy  Some editions of the book come with a plush toy of Dennis, the main character, with a teddy bear in one hand and his pillow in the other. All of the toy's limbs are moveable, including the monster's ears, and it was made to be a bedtime toy. The toy follows all of the details in the book, down to the texture of Dennis's skin.

Simon and Cliff Shaw. , and It was the first program deliberately engineered to perform automated reasoning and is called \\"the first artificial intelligence program\\". It would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.  History  In 1955, when Newell and Simon began to work on the Logic Theorist, the field of artificial intelligence did not yet exist. Even the term itself (\\"artificial intelligence\\") would not be coined until the following summer. Simon was a political scientist who had already produced classic work in the study of how bureaucracies function as well as developed his theory of bounded rationality (for which he would later win a Nobel Prize). The study of business organizations requires, like artificial intelligence, an insight into the nature of human problem solving and decision making. Simon remembers consulting at RAND Corporation in the early 1950s and seeing a printer typing out a map, using ordinary letters and punctuation as symbols. He realized that a machine that could manipulate symbols could just as well simulate decision making and possibly even the process of human thought. The program that printed the map had been written by Newell, a RAND scientist studying logistics and organization theory. For Newell, the decisive moment was in 1954 when Oliver Selfridge came to RAND to describe his work on pattern matching. Watching the presentation, Newell suddenly understood how the interaction of simple, programmable units could accomplish complex behavior, including the intelligent behavior of human beings. \\"It all happened in one afternoon,\\" he would later say. It was a rare moment of scientific epiphany. > \\"I had such a sense of clarity that this was a new path, and one I was going > to go down. I haven't had that sensation very many times.

No. > Completely absorbed for ten to twelve hours.\\" Newell and Simon began to talk about the possibility of teaching machines to think. Their first project was a program that could prove mathematical theorems like the ones used in Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead's Principia Mathematica. They enlisted the help of computer programmer Cliff Shaw, also from RAND, to develop the program. (Newell says \\"Cliff was the genuine computer scientist of the three\\"). The first version was hand- simulated: they wrote the program onto 3x5 cards and, as Simon recalled: > In January 1956, we assembled my wife and three children together with some > graduate students. To each member of the group, we gave one of the cards, so > that each one became, in effect, a component of the computer program ... > Here was nature imitating art imitating nature. They succeeded in showing that the program could successfully prove theorems as well as a talented mathematician. Eventually Shaw was able to run the program on the computer at RAND's Santa Monica facility. In the summer of 1956, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester organized a conference on the subject of what they called \\"artificial intelligence\\" (a term coined by McCarthy for the occasion). Newell and Simon proudly presented the group with the Logic Theorist and were somewhat surprised when the program received a lukewarm reception. Pamela McCorduck writes \\"the evidence is that nobody save Newell and Simon themselves sensed the long-range significance of what they were doing.\\" Simon confides that \\"we were probably fairly arrogant about it all\\" and adds: > They didn't want to hear from us, and we sure didn't want to hear from them: > we had something to show them! ... In a way it was ironic because we already > had done the first example of what they were after; and second, they didn't > pay much attention to it. Logic Theorist soon proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in chapter 2 of the Principia Mathematica. The proof of theorem 2.85 was actually more elegant than the proof produced laboriously by hand by Russell and Whitehead. Simon was able to show the new proof to Russell himself who \\"responded with delight\\". They attempted to publish the new proof in The Journal of Symbolic Logic but it was rejected on the grounds that a new proof of an elementary mathematical theorem was not notable, apparently overlooking the fact that one of the authors was a computer program. Newell and Simon formed a lasting partnership, founding one of the first AI laboratories at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and developing a series of influential artificial intelligence programs and ideas, including GPS, Soar, and their unified theory of cognition.  Logic Theorist's influence on AI  Logic Theorist introduced several concepts that would be central to AI research: ;Reasoning as search : Logic Theorist explored a search tree: the root was the initial hypothesis, each branch was a deduction based on the rules of logic. Somewhere in the tree was the goal: the proposition the program intended to prove. The pathway along the branches that led to the goal was a proof ‚Äì a series of statements, each deduced using the rules of logic, that led from the hypothesis to the proposition to be proved. ;Heuristics : Newell and Simon realized that the search tree would grow exponentially and that they needed to \\"trim\\" some branches, using \\"rules of thumb\\" to determine which pathways were unlikely to lead to a solution. They called these ad hoc rules \\"heuristics\\", using a term introduced by George P√≥lya in his classic book on mathematical proof, How to Solve It. (Newell had taken courses from P√≥lya at Stanford). Heuristics would become an important area of research in artificial intelligence and remains an important method to overcome the intractable combinatorial explosion of exponentially growing searches. ;List processing : To implement Logic Theorist on a computer, the three researchers developed a programming language, IPL, which used the same form of symbolic list processing that would later form the basis of McCarthy's Lisp programming language, an important language still used by AI researchers.  Philosophical implications  Pamela McCorduck writes that the Logic Theorist was \\"proof positive that a machine could perform tasks heretofore considered intelligent, creative and uniquely human\\". And, as such, it represents a milestone in the development of artificial intelligence and our understanding of intelligence in general. Simon famously told a graduate class in January 1956, \\"Over Christmas, Al Newell and I invented a thinking machine,\\"CMU Libraries: Problem Solving Research and would write: > [We] invented a computer program capable of thinking non-numerically, and > thereby solved the venerable mind-body problem, explaining how a system > composed of matter can have the properties of mind. This statement, that machines can have minds just as people do, would be later named \\"Strong AI\\" by philosopher John Searle. It remains a serious subject of debate up to the present day. Pamela McCorduck also sees in the Logic Theorist the debut of a new theory of the mind, the information processing model (sometimes called computationalism). She writes that \\"this view would come to be central to their later work, and in their opinion, as central to understanding mind in the twentieth century as Darwin's principle of natural selection had been to understanding biology in the nineteenth century.\\" Newell and Simon would later formalize this proposal as the physical symbol systems hypothesis.

United States In the United States, gambling wins are taxable. The Internal Revenue Code contains a specific provision regulating income-tax deductions of gambling losses. Under Section 165(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, losses from ‚Äúwagering transactions‚Äù may be deducted to the extent of gains from gambling activities.IRC Section 165(d). Essentially, in order to qualify for a deduction of losses from wagering, the taxpayer can only deduct up to the amount of gains he or she accrued from wagering. In Commissioner v. Groetzinger, the Supreme Court Justice Blackmun alludes to Section 165(d) which was a legislative attempt to close the door on suspected abuse of gambling loss deductions.480 U.S. 23, 32 (1987). =Wagering Transaction= The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that a ‚Äúwagering transaction‚Äù consists of three elements.Technical Advice Memorandum 200417004. First, the transaction must involve a prize. Second, the element of chance must be present. Finally, the taxpayer must give some consideration. =Section 165(d) and Professional Gamblers= In Bathalter v. Commissioner, a full-time horse- race gambler had gains of $91,000 and losses of $87,000.T.C. Memo 1987-530. The taxpayer deducted the expenses under Section 162.IRC Section 162. The service argued that Section 165(d) precluded the taxpayer from engaging in gambling as a \\"trade or business.\\" The Tax Court held that the taxpayer's gambling was a business activity and allowed the deductions.Id. In essence, the court held that Section 165(d) only applies when a taxpayer is at a loss instead of a net gain and ‚Äúserves to prevent the [taxpayer] from using that loss to offset other income.‚Äù Id. However, if the taxpayer has a net gain, as the horse-race gambler did, then the taxpayer may deduct the expenses under Section 162, and Section 165(d) does not apply.Id. =Section 165(d) and Recreational Gamblers= In addition, in Valenti v. Commissioner, the court reiterated that Section 165(d) applies to professional gamblers as well as recreational gamblers.T.C. Memo 1994-483. The court stated, \\"... it has been held both by this Court and various courts of appeals that wagering losses cannot be deducted, except to the extent of the taxpayer's gains from wagering activities, and it has been so held even where such activities were conducted as a trade or business as opposed to a hobby.\\"Id. Therefore, for example, if a recreational gambler visits a casino one Saturday and accumulates $600 of losses and $200 of gains, that recreational gambler may deduct $200 of the wagering losses (because she can only deduct an amount up to the amount of wagering gains she accrued). United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, wins (unless in the course of a trade) are not taxable and losses are not deductible.  Germany  In Germany, wins are taxable since July 2012 by 5% of the winnings (profit).  Canada  In Canada gambling income is not generally taxable. If the gambling activity can be considered as a hobby, the income is not taxable. If the gambling is carried out in businesslike behaviour, then the income is taxable and losses deductible. Making approximately $50 million in sports lottery bets and earning a profit of $5 million was not considered businesslike behaviour in Leblanc v. The Queen. However, in the case of Luprypa v. The Queen the gambling income was ruled to be taxable. The case involved a skilled pool player that profited approximately $1000 per week playing staked pool games against bar patrons. Poker differs from many other forms of gambling as skilled players may increase their chances of winning significantly. In the case Cohen v. The Queen judge ruled that the gambling activities were not conducted in sufficiently businesslike manner and thus the losses were not deductible. See also *William E.

A donkey used to carry the linen from one monastery to another. One day, while looking for the donkey, she came across a wolf. The wolf admitted to killing the donkey and begged for forgiveness. Austrebertha reprimanded the wolf, but forgave him and commanded that he carry the laundry himself, a task that the wolf performed for the rest of its life.Wolves and Early Saints At the place of the death of the donkey a chapel was erected in the seventh century; then, when it fell into ruin, a simple stone cross replaced it. It, in turn, was later replaced by an oak, in which was placed a statue of the Virgin. This tale is depicted in the stained glass window of the chapel in the village of Sainte-Austreberthe.

Tomek House, also known as The Ship House or as the Ferdinand Frederick and Emily Tomek House, is a historic house at 150 Nuttall Road in Riverside, Illinois. It is prominent example of Prairie School design by Frank Lloyd Wright. Designed in 1904 and construction finished in 1906, the Tomek House is a well-preserved example of the style. In addition to being a good example of the Prairie style, the Tomek house documents the development of the style, which reached its clearest expression in Wright's Robie House in 1908. It is included in the Riverside Historic District and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1999. and History The Tomek house was constructed for Ferdinand Frederick Tomek from 1905 to 1906. Tomek worked in a factory that produced picture frames and wooden moldings. The Tomeks resided in the house until 1924. The house is considered an important artifact of the development of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie School of design. Barry Byrne was the assistant architect for the house. The Tomek house served as a model for the Robie House, Wright's famed 1910 design. Like most of his projects, Wright designed the furniture for the Tomek house. In 1973, the Illinois Historic Structures Survey identified it as a significant site. The house has been extensively restored. The Illinois Department of Conservation approved a grant for this purpose to the Moran family in 1979. The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency approved the changes and issued a Certificate of Rehabilitation. In 1993, the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy was offered an easement to help protect the residence. On January 20, 1999, the house was named a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service, owing to its role as a site of national-level significance.

It was first released on his 1971 debut album Cold Spring Harbor and was also released as a b-side to his singles \\"She's Got a Way\\" and \\"Tomorrow Is Today.\\" Live versions were included on the albums Songs in the Attic, 12 Gardens Live and Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert. Lyrics and music The lyrics to \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" describe a spoiled woman who thinks she is better than everyone now that she has become famous. She now considers herself too good to return to her hometown of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island. Joel took the title for his debut album from this line of the song. Despite her haughtiness, the singer desires her as does everyone else. The singer warns her that even though now she can take her attention for granted, since everyone wants her, eventually they will stop caring about her and she will be lonely. Joel biographer Fred Schruers describes the song as \\"both a rebuke and confession of tangled desire.\\" Ken Bielen describes \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" as \\"an acoustic guitar-based shuffle.\\" Joel plays piano on the song. Bielen describes Joel's piano playing as \\"upbeat\\" and Schruers describes him as playing \\"hammering, almost barrelhouse chords. Joel has described \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" as a \\"zinger\\" that \\"balanced out\\" the corniness of \\"She's Got a Way,\\" saying that \\"I can be venomous but I could also be a mush.\\" Joel originally included \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" on a five-song demo tape that also included other songs that would appear on Cold Spring Harbor such as \\"She's Got a Way\\" and \\"Tomorrow Is Today\\" which Joel made in an unsuccessful attempt to secure his first solo recording contract with Paramount Records. Live versions Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the live version included on Songs in the Attic as hitting harder than the studio version. Joel has said that at the time he had reinterpreted the song as \\"a macho rationale for being rejected. Her? Leave me? She must be a self-possessed bitch! Anyway, everybody didn't really love her. I just thought that they did.\\" A 16 mm black and white promotional video was made of \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" being performed live at a small club in support of Songs in the Attic. Joel has often played the song live before and since. For example, he played it at the Gaslight au Go Go in 1971 and at Carnegie Hall in 1973. He played it as the 2006 shows at Madison Square Garden and the song was included on the resulting album 12 Gardens Live. This version incorporates a Hammond B-3 organ, which according to Bielen adds \\"soulful fullness.\\" Joel also included it in his set for the final concert at Shea Stadium in July 2008, and it was included on the resulting album Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert. Critical reception As early as 1974, Billboard Magazine critic Jim Melanson described \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" as one of the songs that had brought Joel to national attention. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the studio version as being \\"bitterly cynical\\" and rated it as one of Joel's \\"finest songs.\\" Joel biographer Hank Bordowitz called it a \\"remarkable composition that, while not great, at least indicate[d] a rising talent.\\" Billboard Magazine's Roy Waddell similarly described it as a \\"chestnut\\" that didn't get its \\"proper due\\" until the live version was released on Songs in the Attic. Music critic Mark Bego praises Joel's \\"keyboard dexterity\\" and the drumming on the song, saying that it \\"perfectly confronts the ironic duality of a life in show business.\\" According to Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Paul Evans, \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" was a precursor for the sarcasm Joel would incorporate in his songs throughout his career.

Powell and David Washington. Anita Baker was featured as lead vocalist on their first, self-titled album on Ariola in 1979, produced by Michael and Derek. History The group was started in Detroit in the late 1970s. Derek Dirckson became the band leader after James Mitchell asked Derek to play drums with Chapter 8, who were at the time the backup Band for the Detroit Emeralds. In 1979, Dirckson and Michael J. Powell produced the first album expanding the groups roster to include Anita Baker, Gerald Lyles, David Washington, Van Cephus, Courtlen Hale, Scott Guthre, and Allen Nance. In 1985, Valerie Pinkston replaced Baker as the lead vocalist and was featured on \\"This Love's For Real\\" As Chapter 8 was the launching pad for Baker, so was it for Michael J. Powell who went on to produce Baker's \\"Rapture\\", \\"Giving You The Best That I Got\\", and \\"Compositions\\" albums. Many of the Chapter 8 group members can be found performing on these 1980s recording masterpieces. Ariola was merged with the Bertelsmann Music Group (the same company that owned Arista Records, the longtime home of Baker's main rival Whitney Houston) in 1987, and Baker would end a ten-year hiatus in 2004, when she released \\"My Everything\\" under Capitol's Blue Note Records sub-label. Derek Dirckson went on to discover, manage and produce, Fred Hammond, Commissioned, The Winans, John P. Kee, Mary, Mary, and the great gospel plays, \\"Momma Don't\\", \\"Wicked\\", \\"Come Out of The Rain\\", and many more.

On 23 February 1902, the company, now renamed the Karatsu Railway, merged with the Kyushu Railway which undertook the next phase of expansion. The track was extended east, with opening as the final eastern terminus on 14 December 1903. Ogi opened on the same day as an intermediate station on the track. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, the line which served the station was designated the Karatsu Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 1,053 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 157th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

It also served as the corporate headquarters until 1973, when the Sears Tower was completed. Of its original complex, only three buildings now survive, and have been adaptively rehabilitated to other uses. The complex was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, at which time it still included the mail order plant, the world's largest commercial building when it was completed. That building has been demolished, its site taken up by the Homan Square redevelopment project. These core buildings occupy an area bounded on the north by West Arthington Street, the west by Central Park Avenue, the east by Spaulding Avenue, and the south by West Fillmore Street. The surviving buildings can be seen from Homan and West Arthington. History Sears was founded in 1886, renamed Sears Roebuck in 1893 when Alvah Roebuck joined the firm, and was originally headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Experiencing rapid growth, the retailer in 1895 moved its headquarters to a building on West Adams Street in Chicago, and again the following year to Fulton and Desplaines Streets. The company's rapid growth created problems with the fulfillment of orders, because it had to lease space all over the city to warehouse its products. In 1904 the company purchased over of land on Chicago's West Side, and embarked on one of the largest retail development projects to date. The centerpiece of the company-owned \\"city within a city\\" were its central administration building, a merchandise development house, and a mail order processing facility, along with a power plant to provide electricity and heat to the entire complex. Designed by Nimmons and Fellows, a local architectural firm, the complex was so large the company required city permission to build over some city streets. In the 1920s extensive athletic facilities were added to the complex, as an encouragement for after-work socialization to keep employee morale high. Included were a clubhouse and tennis courts, and the Sears Department of the YMCA. Events included an annual track and field competitions, and company baseball teams. The full extent of the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex (towering cluster of buildings in center), circa 1950. By 1926, the first ground level parking lots replaced the athletic fields. This happened at the same time that a strategic shift from catalog sales to retail stores had started with easy auto travel making travel to a store more practical. By 1943 the complex had become a city within itself. Sears created their own services for effective use, much advanced beyond what was required at the time, including: * a company fire department, with volunteer firemen, and early use of fire sprinklers. * a 200,000-gallon water tank, water use and fire prevention purposes. * a newspaper publicity office. * a cafeteria ‚Äì originally men and women were separated, and multiple levels of service for all employee lunch and breakfast. * a private bank offering services for employees on site. The company's growth continued through the 20th century, and by the 1960s it was the largest retailer in the world. Changing trends in retail sales and methods led to a decline, and the company's mail order business was scaled back in 1987, moving out of these premises. The corporate headquarters had been moved in 1973 to the Sears Tower, so the complex then stood vacant. Its closure of the complex presented the city with a redevelopment problem. In 1992 a non- profit partnership organized by former Sears management began to redevelop the site, now dubbed Homan Square. The mail order merchandise building was demolished (except for its main tower), and the land it occupies has been redeveloped to include new residences, retail, and a community center. Homan Square is used as an example of the gradual turn around of North Lawndale. Included in this reconstruction effort is the massive rehabilitation of the former Sears Power House, into the Charles H. Shaw Technology and Learning Center‚Äîa LEED Platinum historic renovation designed by Farr Associates. Surviving buildings The elements that survive from the early period of the Sears complex development are organized around South Homan Avenue, between West Arthington Street and the railroad tracks to the south. The merchandise tower, the only surviving element of the 3-million-square-foot Merchandise Building, is to the west, and the Power House and Administration Building are to the east. Beyond those two, fronting on West Arthington and Spaulding Avenue, is the former Merchandise Laboratory. =Sears Merchandise Building Tower= The Sears Merchandise Building Tower is a fourteen-story structure, with a limestone base and brick walls. It is crowned by a Classical Revival top floor with round-arch windows and a modillioned cornice. It housed water tanks for firefighting on the upper levels, as well as offices and secretarial training facilities. It also housed the early broadcast facilities for WLS-AM. In 2015, it was refurbished and reopened to the public as the \\"John D. and Alexandra C. Nichols Tower\\". It now houses non-profit groups and offices, including a classroom on the 12th floor for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The Sears Roebuck plaque is still visible on top of the building. =Administration Building= The Sears, Roebuck and Company Administration Building is a broad five-story masonry building, occupying about 3/4 of the block facing West Arthington between South Homan and Spaulding. It has ornate Classical Revival detailing applied to an otherwise fairly typical Chicago School design. =Power Station= The Power Station is a rectangular, nominally single-story, brick structure measuring . Its front facade is characterized by tall and large round-arch windows, with a stepped parapet above. =Merchandise Development Laboratory= This building, which is an L-shaped structure six stories in height and finished in brick, housed the company's catalog printing operation from 1905 to 1926.

The church was supposedly founded in 864 when citizens from the mainland town of Aquileia fled to the lagoon islands of Venice to avoid the barbarian hordes. It was one of the churches under the jurisdiction of the patriarch of Grado who lived in Venice. It is dedicated to Canzio, Canziano, and Canzianilla, two brothers and a sister who were martyred for their faith at Aquileia. The church at the site was renovated in 1330, consecrated in 1351, and restored in 1550, and again finally reshaped in the early 18th century to a design by Antonio Gaspari. The facade was reconstructed in 1706 using a bequest from Michele Tommasi. The campanile dates from 1532. The nave ceiling was raised during the rebuilding in the mid-18th century using designs of Giorgio Massari. The four side altars dedicated to the Madonna have canvases by Giuseppe Angeli and Bartolomeo Letterini. The rich sculptural and stucco decoration was contributed by the Widmann family. Clemente Molli sculpted the statue of San Maximus, first bishop of Cittanova in Istria. The chancel altarpiece depicts The Glory of the martyred Saints Canzio, Canziano, and Canzianilla attributed to Paolo Zoppo.It is flanked by a painting of the Probatic Pond and Multiplication of the loaves by Domenico Zanchi.

History The Mops were formed in 1966 by a group of high schoolers: Mikiharu Suzuki (drums), Taro Miyuki (guitar), Masaru Hoshi (or Katu Hoshi) (guitar), and Kaoru Murakami (bass). They began as an instrumental rock group similar to The Ventures, but soon after forming, Mikiharu Suzuki's brother Hiromitsu joined on lead vocals. The group began to play psychedelic rock at the suggestion of their manager, who had brought home recordings of American hippie groups such as Jefferson Airplane from his trip to San Francisco. The group signed to JVC Records, the Japanese wing of Victor Records, and released a single in November 1967 called \\"Asamade Matenai\\", which hit No. 38 on the Japanese charts. In April 1968, the full-length debut, Psychedelic Sound in Japan, followed; the album included covers of \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\" by Jefferson Airplane, \\"Light My Fire\\" by The Doors, as well as \\"Inside-Looking Out\\" and \\"San Franciscan Nights\\" by The Animals. They received much press for being the \\"first psychedelic band\\" in Japan, and performed with elaborate light shows. Bassist Murakami quit the group in 1969, and guitarist Miyuki moved to bass. The group then signed with Liberty/Toshiba/EMI, moving to a blues rock and hard rock sound, and followed with the hits \\"Tadorituitara Itumo Amefuri\\" \\"Gekko Kamen (Moonlight Mask)\\" and \\"Goiken Muyo (No Excuse)\\", both of which charted in 1971. Several albums followed before the group's breakup in May 1974. After The Mops, Hoshi remained in the music industry, working as an arranger. Hiromitsu Suzuki became a TV personality and actor, and Mikiharu Suzuki embarked on a successful career in artist management.

The Act was passed by the California legislature and signed by Governor Hiram Johnson in 1913, and became effective on 3 November 1914. Under the Act, brothels around the state were eventually shut down. The legislation was modelled on the liquor laws that had originated in Iowa. The law was opposed by some California residents who gathered signatures for a veto referendum, 53% of voters voted yes and the new act became law. The Act stated \\"every building or place used for the purpose of prostitution, and every building or place in or upon which acts of prostitution, are held or occur, is a nuisance which should be enjoined, abated, and prevented, and for which damages may be recovered.\\" By 1920, 33 states has passed similar legislation. Under the act owners of the buildings where prostitution takes place are fined by the city. This led many property owners to be more vigilant of the activity which took place in their buildings, as well as to institute discriminatory renting practices, such as not allowing single women to rent a first floor apartment. In some places, women could not rent an apartment at all. As a result, prostitution moved to the streets, making the practice more dangerous. After many years, most red light districts ceased to exist under this act. The legislation was still in use in 2018, when it was used to shut down San Jose massage parlors run by Hung Nguyen.

Editions The work was finished on April 22, 1501,Judita:Posveta: \\"Od rojen'ja Isukarstova u puti godi≈°ƒáe parvo nako(n) tisuƒáa i pet sat, na dvadeset i dva dni miseca aprila. U Splitu gradu.\\" and was published three times during Maruliƒá's lifetime. The first edition was arranged by Petar Sriƒáiƒá of Split and was printed in Venice by Guglielmo da Fontaneto on August 13, 1521, that is, 20 years after it was written. One extant copy of the first edition is held in the Mala braƒáa Franciscan library in Dubrovnik, and the other in the Zadar family Paravia's library, which is today a part of the Scientific Library of Zadar. The second edition was edited by Zadar librarian Jerolim Mirkoviƒá, published on May 30, 1522, and is illustrated with nine woodcuts depicting war scenes. The ninth woodcut is signed with the letter M, and it was therefore assumed that Maruliƒá himself was the author of the woodcuts. One copy of Mirkoviƒá's edition was given to the University Library by Ivan Kukuljeviƒá, and the other copy, still held in the Collection of Manuscripts and Old Books of the University Library, originates from the Kukuljeviƒá's legacy. The third edition was printed on January 29, 1522, for the Dubrovnik librarian Jacomo di Negri. (Transposing the date from Venetian calendar, the publication date would be January 29, 1523). The only surviving copy of that edition is held at the Bavarian State Library in Munich. Theme and influence The frequency of printing indicates that the text found its readership not only in Split, which had at most 200 literate citizens at the time, but in other Dalmatian centres. The poem contains 2126 dodecasyllabic lines, with caesurae after the sixth syllable, composed in six books (libars). The linguistic basis of the book is Split ƒåakavian speech and the ≈†tokavian lexis, and the Glagolitic original of the legend; the work thus foreshadows the unity of Croatian language. Maruliƒá's Judith has none of the decorative epithets typical of folk epics. The epic poem is also notable for the Humanistic treatment of the subject and the author's Petrarchan descriptions of Judith's beauty. Judith is interesting as a cultural monument as well as for its composition. The author's choice of a subject that simultaneously deals with an act of heroism and a crime shows suggests he privileged the literary structure (plot, drama) of the material, and only then considered its moralistic overtones. Thematically, the Judita deals with the story of the widow Judith who by her heroic act‚Äîthe alleged treason, seduction and the murder of Assyrian general Holofernes‚Äîsaves the city of Bethulia. It was no accident that Maruliƒá chose the story of the Biblical Judith for literary treatment. His work stemmed in part from his desire to offer a literature to \\"even those who understand no scholarly books\\",\\"i onima, koji ƒëaƒçke knjige ne razumiju\\" and the plot would seem to have contemporary parallels‚Äîa homeland invaded by foreigners, as the Balkans were being swept by the \\"eastern dragon\\"‚Äîthe Ottoman Turks. Insofar as the poem has political or moral weight, Judith is intended as an exemplar of confidence in God and in eternal justice. The plot =The first book= The first book describes the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (who conquered Syria and Palestine), his slaying of Arpachshad, and his desire to rule the world. Nebuchadnezzar sends his general Holofernes to conquer as much land as he can, terrorizing the inhabitants. =The second book= Holofernes' military campaign, ranging across many lands, finally brings him to Israel. The people, in horror, pray to God for salvation. =The third book= Holofernes lays siege to Bethulia, cutting off the town's water supply. After much hardship, the leaders of the town decide to surrender, but Duke Ozias begs the Jews to be patient for five more days, to await God's salvation. =The fourth book= Judith, widow of Menasses, prays to the Lord and, along with Abra, her slave, flees the city that same night. God bestows upon her the gift of extraordinary beauty, which she will use to seduce Holofernes. =The fifth book= Holofernes invites Judith to dinner in his tent. On the fourth day of a festival, a drunken Holofernes falls asleep. Judith cuts off his head and mounts it on the city gates in view of his men. They flee in horror, and those who remain are easily driven off by the citizens. =The sixth book= The sixth book describes events in the Jerusalem after the departure of Holofernes' army. The High Priest Eliakim arrives with his priests to see Judith. She leaves for Jerusalem and returns after three months. She never remarries, and there is peace in the land as long as she lives. After her death she is mourned by the citizens for seven days. Translations Judita was translated into standard Croatian in the 20th century: in 1969, Ivan Slamnig published a prose translation of the first chapter, and in 1983, Marko Grƒçiƒá published a book containing the entire translation with an inline comparison to the original text. Nikica Kolumbiƒá published a lyrical translation of the first chapter in 1971, and completed the translation in 1985.

Built in 1838, it was for many years home to Owen Lovejoy (1811-1864), a prominent abolitionist and congressman. Lovejoy was an open operator of shelter and support on the Underground Railroad, and his house contains a concealed compartment in which escaped slaves could be hidden. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. and It is open seasonally or by appointment for tours. Description and history The Owen Lovejoy House stands on the outer fringe of the developed town center of Princeton, on the north side of East Peru Street between 7th and 8th Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and vernacular Greek Revival styling. The left half of its broad front is sheltered by a hip-roofed porch, which wraps around the left side. An ell extends to the rear of the building. On the second floor is an attic space that has been traditionally ascribed the role as a fugitive hiding place. It is a triangular space running along the back of the main block, whose presence is obscured by the arrangements of the walls on the back staircase. The space appears to have been deliberately constructed in this way, and it is not obviously amenable for use as a more conventional storage space. The main part of the house was built in 1835 by Butler Denham, who had acquired land here the previous year. It was expanded soon afterward to the rear, and again about 1850 to the east. Denham, a Massachusetts native, farmed here and died in 1841. His wife Eunice remarried, to Owen Lovejoy, a fiery abolitionist lawyer from Maine. Lovejoy was a prominent organizer of abolitionist activity in Illinois, and helped organize the state Republican Party with Abraham Lincoln in 1854. He notoriously flaunted his assistance to fugitive slaves in anti-slavery speeches he made to the public and on the floor of the United States Congress. Lovejoy's house remained in the family until 1931, when it was sold to a couple who performed a partial restoration, and attempted to operate it as a museum. The effort failed, and the house declined in condition. It was acquired by the city in 1971, and underwent a major rehabilitation over the next year. It has been operated by the city since then as a history museum.

The bell tower dates from the late 16th century. The interior is based on a Greek cross design. Behind the fa√ßade are hung two canvasses, formerly organ doors, by Giovanni Mansueti depicting Saints Onuphrius, Agatha, Andrew and John Chrysostom. Onuphrius was the co-titular patron saint who was revered by the confraternity of the Tentori (dyers of fabrics, covers, and sheets). In 1516, a relic of the saint, his finger, was donated to this church. The chapel on the right has the painting Saints Christopher, Jerome and Louis of Toulouse (1513) by Giovanni Bellini.

In 1996, all Bronner Bros. delegates traveled to Orlando, Florida for a large conference. The annual trade show is now held in the prestigious Georgia World Congress Center. As of 2015, the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show was the largest gathering of multicultural beauty professionals in the U.S., pulling in 22,000 attendees and 300 exhibitors. More and more Bronner family members are getting involved in the company. There were two brothers in the first generation of the business, six brothers in the second generation, the third generation now has 30 members. Bernard Bronner was also a partner in Rainforest Films, which produced films targeting an urban audience and featuring African-American talent, until the company was formally dissolved in 2014. Rainforest's filmography includes Stomp the Yard, The Gospel, Pandora's Box, This Christmas, and Takers.  Bronner Bros. products  Pump It Up is just one of the products made by Bronner Bros. Bronner Bros. products are created primarily for the African-American population but the products can be used on all types of hair. Their main product lines include African Royale, BB, Tropical Roots and they also have an All Natural Product line. Bronner Bros. owns and operates two manufacturing facilities, a shipping facility, two beauty stores, a hair weaving studio and a Public Relations office.  Christian organizations  The Word of Faith Family Worship CathedralBronner Bros. has not been quiet when it comes to the company's Christian beliefs. One of their most successful organizations is The Word of Faith Family Worship Cathedral in Austell, Georgia, founded by Bishop Dale C. Bronner the son of Nathaniel Bronner (one of the Bronner Bros. founders). The ministry has more than 19,000 members and over five branch ministries which it has birthed. Under the motto \\"Reaching the lost, teaching the found,\\" the center provides a number of ministries, including Christian education, Sunday school classes, singles ministry, marriage ministry, prison ministry and the Bronner Business Institute which provides training for those who want to become entrepreneurs. The ministry currently run a school for infant to preschool children called the Seeds of Excellence Christian Academy in Austell, Georgia, blocks away from the Cathedral. Word of Faith recently built a recreation center called The Family Life Center. The Bronner family also founded The Ark of Salvation Worship Center in Atlanta, GA, which Rev. Nathaniel Bronner, Jr., Rev. Charles Bronner and Rev. James Bronner (The Brothers of the Word) lead. This ministry produces television broadcasts throughout the week as well as some leading online ministries.  The Bronner family  Bronner Bros. was co-founded by Dr. Nathaniel H. Bronner, Sr. and Arthur E. Bronner, Sr. The business was passed to Nathaniel's six sons upon his passing in 1993. Nathaniel's sons in order of age include: *Rev. Nathaniel Bronner, Jr.: Manufacturing Director for Bronner Bros., president of Century Systems Inc. and senior pastor at the Ark of Salvation Church. He and his wife Simone have four children. *Bernard Bronner: President of Bronner Bros., publisher of Upscale, partner in Rainforest Films, and Show & Sales Director for Bronner Bros. He and his wife Sheila have five children. *Darrow Bronner: Until his death in 2000, was the Show Director and Professional Sales Director for Bronner Bros. He had five children with his wife Jane. *Bishop Dale Bronner: Founder and pastor of the Word of Faith Worship Center. He and his wife Jamie (Nina) Bronner have five children. *Rev. Charles Bronner: Purchasing manager for Bronner Bros. and co- pastor at the Ark of Salvation Church. He and his wife Traci have four children. *Rev. James Bronner: Trade Show Director, Director of technology for Bronner Bros, vice president of Century Systems, Inc., and youth pastor at the Ark of Salvation Church. He and his wife Stephanie have seven children and are co-authors of the marriage book Bedroom Talk. Awards and honors In 2004, Wal-Mart recognized Bronner Bros. as their top vendor of the year in their annual report. The same year, the largest beauty and barber retailing supplier in the United States, Sally Beauty Supply, also named the company their top vendor of the year. =Documentary= Bronner Bros. is featured in Bayer Mack's 2019 documentary, No Lye: An American Beauty Story, that chronicles the rise and decline of the black-owned ethnic beauty industry.

ISSN 1744-9561. PMID 19828493. Supplementary information It was characterised by a robust exoskeleton with scattered tubercles or semicircular scales. The prosoma (head) was subquadrate, protruding antemedially. The chelicerae (claws in front of the mouth) were small. The two first pairs of legs of Mixopterus (appendages II and III) were highly specialized and not used for walking, instead being highly developed with long paired spines. The two following pairs (appendages IV and V) were moderately sized and typically spiniferous walking legs. The last legs, (VI), form a pair of swimming legs characteristic of the Eurypterida.Hanken, N.-M. & St√∏rmer, L. (1975): \\"The trail of a large Silurian eurypterid\\". Fossils and Strata, No. 4, pp. 255-270, Pl. 1 -3. The preabdomen, the front portion of the body, was narrow with axial furrows, while the postabdomen was narrow. The telson was a curved spine. By thrusting and pushing the tail, the telson spine would be capable of stinging prey in between the front legs. The structure of the tail of indicates that Mixopterus would be able to move on land, but such movement would likely be difficult because of its weight. Respiration would not be an issue, since moist gills would be well concealed above the ventral plates. Mixopterus might have buried itself in the sand to wait for prey, as the swimming legs were very well-adapted for digging. The frontal legs and foremost portion of the prosoma, including the eyes, would have been kept above the substrate. When a prey was sufficiently close, the frontal appendages would be clasped together, almost forming a cage.  Paleobiology  left = Locomotion = Eurypterids with swimming legs were capable of both walking on the bottom of bodies of water or swimming through them. Unlike some highly derived eurypterines, Mixopterus is not thought to have been a good swimmer and it likely kept near the bottom. During swimming, the prosomal legs (appendages IV and V) were probably positioned backwards to produce minor lateral strokes. The swimming legs were likely used as flaps for moving vertically. It might have been able to push itself forward with rapid strokes of the ventral plates, but this is considered unlikely. Mixopterus likely walked on the bottom with a gait similar to most insects. The two heavy and specialized frontal appendages, held above the bottom, would balance the weight of the long abdomen. The spread appendages would give a decent foothold, perhaps adjustable by raising the tail. On land, the raised tail would act as balance for the body. This was more important on land, as the weight of the body is larger without water. = Reproduction = Mixopterus preserves a long ventro-medially placed genital appendage. Mating in Mixopterus would likely be similar to that in horseshoe crabs. There is a presumed clasping organ on appendage II shaped as a flat and round lobee with a blade-shaped flat spine behind, overall similar to the clasping organs of Limulus. The male could then attach itself to the lateral corners of the last prosomal segment, and direct its long genital appendage to the point where the eggs were stored by the female.  Ichnology  Tracks attributed to Mixopterus have been discovered in fossil deposits in Ringerike, Norway. The tracks, referred to the ichnogenus Merostomichnites, were made by an arthropod in which only three pairs of legs took part in the gait, the last pair being swimming legs. Swimming legs that constitute the last limbs of the prosoma are present in eurypterine eurypterids, out of which the only reasonably large taxa present in the silurian deposits of Ringerike are Mixopterus kiaeri and Pterygotus holmi. With its slender and spineless walking legs and short genital appendage, Pterygotus could not have produced the tracks, though they match the size and morphology of M. kiaeri rather well. The great morphological similarities as well as the relative abundance of M. kiaeri in the region prompted Hanken and St√∏rmer (1975) to refer the tracks to Mixopterus. Species Size comparison of the three species of Mixopterus Mixopterus contains three valid species, with some others that historically have been assigned to it being recovered as outside of the genus. The species currently seen as valid species of the genus are: * Mixopterus kiaeri St√∏rmer, 1934 \\\\- Ringerike, Norway (Silurian) *Mixopterus multispinosus Clarke & Ruedemann, 1912 \\\\- New York (Silurian) *Mixopterus simonsoni Schmidt, 1883 \\\\- Saaremaa, Estonia (Silurian) Invalid or reassigned species are listed below: * Mixopterus dolichoschelus Peach and Horne, 1899 \\\\- Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, Scotland (Silurian), reclassified as its own genus, Lanarkopterus.

Both Aubineau Peak and Rees Peak are higher, but they do not have enough prominence to be considered independent peaks. In spite of the name \\"Doyle\\" on modern maps this elevation was known as \\"Schultz\\" Peak at least through the 1930s. \\"Doyle Peak\\" was traditionally the name of the ridge west of Fremont Peak. The elevation called \\"Schultz\\" on modern maps traditionally had no name. Hiking Schultz Peak can be somewhat challenging depending on the route used, but it is not difficult to ascend. Care must be taken to avoid the scree slopes which can be seen from the south in Flagstaff. These slopes are quite steep and slide easily. The peak is most easily scaled by hiking the Weatherford Trail to Schultz Saddle, then following the old and now indistinct mule trail to the summit, or by following the ridge from Lockett Meadow. Schultz Peak is not the gently rounded mountain it appears to be from Flagstaff but a ridge oriented southwest to northeast. The area of the summit is rather flat and wide in several spots. A small structure on the south side of the summit of Schultz Peak and referred to by some as a shepherd's cabin was actually built by Lowell Observatory in 1927 to house a telescope. The site was selected by Dr. V. M. Slipher, Director of Lowell Observatory, for a pair of Bristlecone Pine trees oriented in a north-south line so that they could be cut and pressed into service as supports for the Polar Axle of the telescope. The Polar Axle and telescopes were constructed by the Stanley Sykes of Lowell Observatory, and the cabin housing the telescope was constructed by Ramon Vilma (spelling?), a local stonemason . The structure had a corrugated metal roof that could be rolled off to expose the telescope for observations. The Polar Axle was taken by truck on the then-new Weatherford Road to Schultz Saddle, then by mule to the Schultz Peak summit, and the two telescopes used there were hauled up in the same way. The telescopes were a reflector and a reflector. The observing site also had a small dormitory partially cut into the hillside east of the telescope, but only an indistinct depression remains. From 1927 until 1932 this was the highest astronomical observing site on Planet Earth. This distinction passed to the Swiss in 1932 when they commissioned a slightly higher observing site on the Jungfrau. The original purpose of the site was to make spectroscopic observations of planets, stars, and nebulae to exploit the increased atmospheric transmission - especially in ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths - at high altitude. A similar telescope and roll-off structure was constructed at the Mars Hill campus of Lowell Observatory so that spectroscopic observations made at the two sites could be compared. The telescope at Mars Hill is still in service and now mounts a reflector. Today it is used by Dr. G. W. Lockwood to collect long-term data on variability of Solar Radiation and it has a fascinating history in its own right . The telescopes and Polar Axle from the Schultz Peak site still exist, and one of the bearing assemblies from the original roll-off roof has been retrieved from Schultz Peak as a possible future museum exhibit. Between 1931 and 1933 the Harvard-Cornell Meteor Expedition under the direction of Dr. Ernst √ñpik, Dr. Harlow Shapley of Harvard, and Dr. Samuel L. Boothroyd of Cornell used Lowell's Schultz Peak Station as one of its meteor observing sites. They used the vibrating mirror technique developed by Dr. √ñpik and Dr. Boothroyd to measure the velocity of meteors, and they recorded meteor tracks from two locations to compute the altitude of meteors by their parallax. The second observing site for parallax measurement was originally near Bellmont, AZ, but was later moved to Padre Canyon, AZ. In 1933 Dr. Boothroyd returned to test the new vacuum deposition technique of mirror coating that had recently been developed at Cornell University. Thus the telescope at the Schultz Peak Station was briefly the world's largest telescope coated by the new, superior aluminization technique. Vacuum aluminization remains the preferred method of coating telescope mirrors for all but a few very specific applications. Several of the astronomers who used the Schultz Peak Station made important contributions to Astronomy, and several scientific papers were published using data obtained at the Schultz Peak Station. This is a strong argument for correcting the naming error and returning the \\"Schultz\\" and \\"Doyle\\" names to their proper peaks. The telescope and Polar Axle were removed from the Schultz Peak Station in 1937 by Dr. V. M. Slipher and some of the junior staff of the Lowell Observatory. The facility was abandoned and by the 1970s the roof had collapsed from years of neglect and winter snow, which can completely bury it. It was reconstructed about then by hikers as a cabin, though maintaining the structure is an ongoing process. Many hikers and campers leave supplies and provisions in the cabin or use them when needed. If you visit look for a waterproof container with a log book and other information. Also while you are there, look for the two Bristlecone stumps that defined the location. They are near the centers of the north and south walls of the cabin, the northern one being considerably taller. Please enjoy and help to preserve this unique and little-known Flagstaff treasure. As of August 2016 the cabin on Doyle has been rebuilt, not to original but to a functional state. Roof, a new East wall with a rock piled fireplace and a small amount of firewood cut and split and stacked inside for the use of anyone in need. All material was repurposed from what was there, roof tin, lumber, rocks. New nails and plumbers tape were hiked in, while the ridge beam and rafters were cut in place using dead trees from the top of the mountain, no living trees were used for building nor for firewood.

Plot The film is set in Africa roughly one million years ago, at a time when one species of \\"man-apes\\" (Australopithecus robustus) was being displaced by the ancestors of modern humans. These ancestors are possibly Homo erectus, but they are never named in the film. They are only addressed as \\"man\\" and from the few scenes where they show any visibility, they vaguely resemble modern humans. The film follows the last of the man-apes (Peter Elliott) as he wanders through the wilderness after his tribe is slaughtered by the aggressive humans who have invented the ax and have learned to make use of fire. He journeys through a savanna, an oasis, a desert, and eventually the shores of a beach. Along the way, he avoids the humans that killed his family and witnesses many fantastic sights of wildlife. After experiencing a hallucination brought on by ingesting a hallucinogenic plant (possibly a reference to the stoned ape theory), he realizes the stone ax that he has been carrying after finding it at the site where his tribe was killed is a weapon. When he comes across a human footprint at the ocean shore, he sniffs it and then starts hitting it, wanting revenge against the humans. But he then relents and tosses the ax into the ocean. The closing scene has him sitting mournfully on the beach as the sun sets. The closing text states that the \\"man-apes\\" were likely the first species humanity pushed into extinction. Genre Missing Link is an unusual film in that it blends elements of drama, documentary, and avant-garde cinema. There is no dialogue, though there is narration (by Michael Gambon). There is also very little action. Instead, the film is filled with extended, picturesque sequences reminiscent of the style often used in nature documentaries. Perhaps due to its unconventionality, the film was not a commercial success.

(also known as MSG Sports) is an American sports holding company based in New York City. MSG Sports manages professional sports teams. These include the NBA's New York Knicks and their NBA G League affiliates, the Westchester Knicks, and the NHL's New York Rangers and their AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. The original company was established in 2010 when Cablevision spun off the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, Madison Square Garden, MSG Network and other entertainment assets as an independent, publicly traded company. In 2015, the original company spun off the sports and entertainment division into a separate company and the original company was renamed to MSG Networks, Inc.; the new company took the name ‚ÄúThe Madison Square Garden Company‚Äù. In 2020, The Madison Square Garden Company rebranded as Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. and subsequently spun off its entertainment division as Madison Square Garden Entertainment. History =Pre-history= On May 31, 1923, Tex Rickard incorporated the New Madison Square Garden Corporation for the purpose of building and operating the third Madison Square Garden. On January 15, 1925, shortly after the Garden opened, the corporation's name was changed to the Madison Square Garden Corporation.Moody's Industrial Manual, 1941 Following the success of the New York Americans, the Madison Square Garden Corporation established the New York Rangers, which began play in 1926. In 1946, at the behest of Knicks president Ned Irish, the Madison Square Garden Corporation became a charter member of the National Basketball Association with the New York Knicks. On April 7, 1960, the Madison Square Garden Corporation merged with its majority shareholder Graham-Paige. On March 9, 1962, Graham-Paige changed its name to the Madison Square Garden Corporation to reflect their largest asset. On August 20, 1977, Gulf and Western Industries, which owned 81% of MSG's stock, purchased complete control of the corporation and turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. At the time of G&W;'s acquisition, the Madison Square Garden Corporation owned the arena, Knicks, Rangers, three horse tracks (Roosevelt Raceway, Arlington Park, and Washington Park Race Track), Holiday on Ice, and real estate holdings in Long Island, Manhattan, and Chicago. In 1989 Gulf and Western shed its non-media and entertainment assets to become Paramount Communications, reflecting its ownership of Paramount Pictures. In 1994, Viacom purchased majority ownership of Paramount Communications, but quickly sold MSG to Cablevision and ITT Corporation. In 1997, ITT sold its half to Cablevision for $650 million. =Main history= In February 2010, Cablevision spun off the MSG properties, including the sports franchises, into The Madison Square Garden Company. On September 30, 2015, the MSG Networks division (including MSG Network) and the main MSG operation were both split as two separate companies. The MSG Network division ended up being the former Madison Square Garden Company and the main MSG operation became the spin off company. The original Madison Square Garden Company was renamed to MSG Networks, Inc. and the new company took the name ‚ÄúThe Madison Square Garden Company‚Äù.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1636519/000163651918000010/tmsgc06302018-10k.htm The Madison Square Garden Company 2018 10-K SEC Filing In September 2018, Madison Square Garden began work on a spherical music venue in Las Vegas, called MSG Sphere Las Vegas, planned to open in 2021. Earlier in the year, MSG announced plans to build MSG Sphere London, near the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford. Both venues are designed by Populous architects and are supposed to incorporate highly advanced audio and visual technologies. Acquisitions On August 17, 2016, MSG acquired a 12% stake in digital media, broadcasting, and events company Townsquare Media from GE Capital. In January 2017 MSG paid $181 million for a majority stake in nightlife group Tao Group On July 31, 2017, MSG acquired a controlling stake in professional video gaming team Counter Logic Gaming. Former holdings The company formerly owned the New York Liberty of the WNBA, until the team was sold in 2018. The company also formerly operated the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and Rentschler Field in East Hartford under contract with the state of Connecticut until the 2007 season when it was replaced by Northland/Anschutz Entertainment Group.\\"The Connecticut Development Authority Selects Facilities Manager for Hartford Civic Center\\" Anti-competitive controversies On several occasion, the Madison Square Garden Company has generated controversy in regard to how it approaches its competition. On two separate occasions they made attempts to block the construction of competing venues in the New York and Los Angeles markets. =West Side Stadium= Before the Madison Square Garden Company was formed, its businesses were part of Cablevision. In 2005, it was proposed that a new West Side Stadium be built for the New York Jets. The stadium would have directly competed with the then- Cablevision owned Madison Square Garden. Cablevision ran TV ads rallying against the proposed stadium which ultimately resulted in the state of New York rejecting the proposal. The rejection of the proposal meant that Madison Square Garden would not have a nearby venue competing for concert revenue. The rejection of the venue also had a negative impact on New York's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, which was ultimately defeated by London. = Los Angeles Clippers arena proposal= In 2018, the Madison Square Garden Company was behind a lawsuit against the city of Inglewood in an attempt to stop the construction of a new basketball arena for the Los Angeles Clippers. The new arena would compete directly with The Forum which is owned by The Madison Square Garden Company. Another lawsuit from a local community group was filed to block the construction of the venue in June 2018. Inglewood mayor James Butts suggested that the lawsuit was brought about by \\"business interests from out-of-state\\", suggesting that the Madison Square Garden Company were using this group to not have a competing arena near by. James Dolan is said to be trying to avoid being deposed in the case. In December 2018, the Los Angeles Clippers countersued the Madison Square Garden Company alleging that they are trying to prevent competition from a new arena by trying to stop its construction. In March 2019, leaked emails revealed that Irving Azoff attempted to lure the Los Angeles Lakers back to The Forum after their lease at the Staples Center was up. Despite nothing coming of the proposal, Azoff's proposal to re-purpose The Forum was seen as a way of preventing the LA Clippers from building their own arena in Inglewood and ensuring that the Madison Square Garden Company got an unfair advantage over rival AEG, which already owns part of the Lakers. In the summer of 2019 it was reported that the company had spent large amounts of money trying to influence Inglewood's mayoral election in the hopes of preventing the construction of the competing arena. In addition, the company also financially supported community groups and lawsuits seeking to prevent the construction of the new arena. The lawsuit became moot in March 2020, when Clippers owner Steve Ballmer announced that he would purchase The Forum for $400 million. The Forum will be repurposed as a dedicated concert venue.

The station's call letters are said to stand for \\"We Serve Valdese Merchants\\". Another popular belief is the letters mean \\"We Serve Valdese, Morganton\\" and since its arrival on the FM dial, it means \\"We Serve a Variety of Music\\". During most of the first decade of the 21st century, WSVM aired the Timeless format, and was owned by Burke County Broadcasting, principals being Robert R. Hilker, William R. Rollins & various Valdese merchants. Both Hilker & Rollins were both past President of the North Carolina Association of Broadcasting and in the North Carolina Broadcasting Hall of Fame! WSVM was part of Suburban Radio Group, owned by Hilker & Rollins. Charlie Hicks worked at the station from 1969 to 1970 before taking the helm at another Suburban Radio Group affiliate. Later on, the station was sold to GHB Broadcasting Company. In August 2008, GHB Broadcasting sold WSVM to Radio Emmanuel, and the format was to be changed to Christian music, with most of the programming in Spanish.John Dayberry, \\"Valdese Radio Station Changes Owners, Format,\\" Morganton News-Herald, July 20, 2008. This did not happen. In later years, local programming on WSVM included Clegg and Company, hosted by Jerry Clegg, and The Trading Post. WSVM ceased operations May 31, 2010 for the \\"immediate future.\\" The last song was \\"May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You\\" by Jim Reeves. The station came back on the air September 1, 2010 by Bannon Broadcasting Company of Hudson operates and manages the day-to- day operation. Jim Bannon operated WSVM with classic hits of the decades of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (rock oldies), plus high school sports. WSVM calls itself V-radio for Valdese. The station is automated except for the \\"Breakfast Club\\" morning show. and a few other local programs. After Bannon Broadcasting Company decided to allow its lease on WSVM to expire on January 2, 2012, GHB of Waxhaw reached a deal to sell the station to the town of Valdese, which planned to use the property for an expansion of a neighboring cemetery. Bert Lindsay bought the WSVM broadcast license from GHB and began running the station prior to the sale's becoming finalized on September 27, 2012 at a purchase price of $12,000. He continued the station's format, including The Trading Post from 10 to 11 six mornings a week, as well as Draughn High School sports; East Burke High School sports will be added. Also being considered are beach music and doo-wop programs, and the return of the Beatles Brunch. =Main Street Broadcasting= The town of Valdese sold the WSVM broadcast equipment to Main Street Broadcasting and is no longer affiliated with the station. The Praley street studios have been listed as \\"residential\\" since Main Street Broadcasting bought the station. WSVM operated from a satellite studio in Baton, NC while construction on the new studio building at 225 west main street Valdese was being completed. Bert Lindsay sold WSVM to Mainstreet Broadcasting effective October 20, 2016 for $9,000. Vance Patterson and Eddie Jolly's company Main Street Broadcasting bought the station equipment from the Town of Valdese and vacated the Praley Street location. WSVM received authorization from the FCC to operate a translator for the Valdese area at 96.5 FM and has been broadcasting since February 3, 2017. In September 2018, WSVM moved into their new modern 21st Century studios designed by broadcast engineer Michael Griffin and located at 225 Main Street, Valdese, NC.

History WSTP signed on New Year's Eve 1939 from the Yadkin Hotel ballroom. Its letters stood for \\"Salisbury Times and Post\\", the town's morning and afternoon newspapers. The Hurley Family who owned the Post were also part owners of WSTP. The station aired the Rose Bowl in 1940. Salisbury eventually became the state's smallest town with two radio stations and a daily newspaper. Mae, Nancy and Nell Kendrick were called \\"The Three Little Sisters\\" and \\"The Singing Sisters\\" in the 1940s, when they worked for WSTP at a time when it was above the Meroney Theatre. On November 22, 1963 and for several days after that, WSTP switched to all classical music, commercial-free, with breaks for news. Tom Harrell and Mary Ann Lanningham owned WSTP from 1956 to July 1, 1995, and Harrell served as general manager. He hired Bill Henderson, morning host from 1963 to 1975. During his tenure, WSTP-FM became WRDX and began airing its own programming. Harrell hired over 200 people over the years, many of them high school and college students, and he said a lot of those who started their careers at WSTP stayed in radio or a related field Also during the early-to-mid-1970s WSTP put out a weekly \\"top 40 type list\\" which was available at local retailers and record shops. The station was known as the \\"Top 40 Rock of The Piedmont\\" and then, during the disco era, \\"15 Fever\\". David Whisenant once played disco music while people learned to dance right in the studio. WSTP personalities who went on to become famous were Cincinnati Reds voice Marty Brennaman, Bob Rathbun and Helen Little. Doug Rice, president and general manager and a co- anchor for Performance Racing Network, joined WSTP in 1977, working a variety of on-air jobs and eventually becoming morning host and program director. He also served as play-by-play announcer for Catawba College football for nearly a decade, and color analyst for Howard Platt for Catawba basketball. Sports coverage also included the Washington Redskins, high school sports and American Legion baseball. Other programming included election coverage, parades, daily obituaries, and church services. Liz Tennant, whose parents designed the station's building, did the farm reports. Dalton Group, owner of WWMG in Charlotte, bought WSTP and WRDX in 1995 for $3 million and began operating the stations under a local marketing agreement. Prior to March 1, 2015 the station was owned by Rowan Media Inc., with a News/Talk format. Programming included G. Gordon Liddy, Dr. Laura, Bill O'Reilly, and The Savage Nation (Michael Savage). Dr. Laura was on WSTP for 15 years until she moved to Sirius XM on January 4, 2011. Fred Thompson was replaced with Steve Malzberg when Thompson dropped his show January 20, 2011. Other programs on the station at that time were The Laura Ingraham Show, Rusty Humphries, Jim Bohannon and Coast to Coast Overnight. WSTP also aired WBTV News from 5:00 to 6:30 during the week. WSTP carried Gary Burbank on Saturday morning for ten years ending in 2005. He was replaced with The Money Pit and Kim Komando. Other weekend programming included Todd Feinberg, who was new, and Tom Martino. The station was an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves radio network, the largest radio affiliate network in Major League Baseball. WSTP was also affiliated with the Tar Heel Sports Network, a division of Learfield Sports. Kent Bernhardt, PRN production coordinator, started working at WSTP in 1977, co-hosted the morning show from 1995 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2015, working for PRN for the eight years in between. His partner on WSTP was Howard Platt, who had done sports on WSTP since 1978. Platt was North Carolina Sportscaster of the Year in 2004. Platt interviewed many famous people for National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association events and the Bing Crosby golf tournament in Bermuda Run, including Flip Wilson, Bob Hope, Bobby Knight, Michael Jordan and Jim Valvano. When Bernhardt left, Mark Brown replaced him. A September 10, 2013 legal notice said the property owned by Timothy and Lisa Coates where the radio station was located would be sold as a result of foreclosure by NewBridge Bank. On September 11, Mike Mangan, who owned WSTP along with Timothy Coates, assured listeners, \\"WSTP is alive and kicking, as it has been since Jan. 1, 1939 ... This station is a pillar in the community.\\" The bank decided not to include the building in the sale but did not say why. After Catawba College Foundation (through 2B Productions LLC) bought WSAT in May 2014, the foundation also bought WSTP. Both stations were to be used as part of a sports communication program starting in 2014‚Äì15. Students would provide local news reporting as well as learning sports coverage. A survey of county residents would be used to determine WSTP's format. Starting January 1, 1939, WSTP broadcast weekly services from St. John's Lutheran Church. The services had aired for 75 years when WSTP had to leave the air after the March 1, 2015 broadcast (starting March 8, the service would temporarily air an hour late on WSAT). WSTP resumed the services but they moved to WSAT and aired a week late (because of WSAT's commitment to First Baptist) starting September 4, 2016. The news/talk format was definitely ending because, said Bill Graham, representing the new owners, \\"I don't want the college associated with a certain political stripe or ideology, and that just simply wouldn't fit.\\" The new format would debut sometime in March after WSTP moved into the WSAT studios. The college was taking over the WSTP studios. On April 1, 2015, WSTP returned to the air with a classic country format, branded as \\"1490 Carolina Country\\".

An extensively altered mid-19th century country inn, it was from 1880 until his death in 1903 the principal residence of Henry Demarest Lloyd (1847‚Äì1903). Lloyd was a leading \\"muckraking\\" journalist of the late 19th century, and a major editorial voice against corporate monopolies and for organized labor. His house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.Blanche Higgins Schroer (1985) , National Park Service and Description and history The Wayside is located on the west side of Sheridan Road, at its junction with Lloyd Place in central eastern Winnetka. It is located across the street from Lloyd Beach, a public park that was previously part of the Lloyd estate. Now set in a small lot, the Lloyd house is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a dormered hip roof. A single-story porch extends across the front and wraps part way down both sides. At the center of the east-facing front facade, a porte-cochere shelters the main stairs accessing the porch. A wood-frame two- story addition extends to the rear of the house. The house interior is largely reflective of the turn of the 20th century, and includes the writing study of Henry Dumarest Lloyd on the third floor in largely unaltered condition. Henry Demarest Lloyd was a native of New York City, and received a law degree from Columbia University. From an early date he was politically active, and became the editor of an anti-tariff advocacy group in the early 1870s. In 1872 he took a position at the Chicago Tribune, where he became a prominent writer critical of industrial and commercial business practices. He was an outspoken opponent of monopolies, and became an increasingly strident voice in support of organized labor. Dining room at The Wayside In the mid-1880s Lloyd's health suffered a decline, and the family purchased The Wayside, then a derelict country inn, in 1878. After restoration and alterations, it became the family's principal home until Lloyd's death in 1903. The Lloyds hosted many prominent individuals of the time here, including Booker T. Washington, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Walter Crane.

History Its capital is Nole and it is ruled by the boy King Bud. Bud, the orphaned son of a fisherman (whose name is unknown), is often aided by his sister Fluff. It was Fluff who received the magic cloak (a garment which is able to grant each wearer one wish) from the fairies. Noland was once attacked by Queen Zixi of the Land of Ix, who wished to obtain the magic cloak. The army of Ix was defeated when one of King Bud's royal counselors used the cloak to wish that the army of Ix would be driven from the land. Bud subsequently used the cloak to wish he would become Noland's best ruler. Noland is ruled by an absolute monarch, whose word is law. If the monarch is away, his counselors are to consult to the Book of the Law for guidance. If the king dies, the 47th person to enter the gates of Nole is to be the new king or queen. Although Noland is located in the same vicinity as Oz and other magical countries, magic is relatively uncommon there, judging by the characters' stunned reactions to the magic cloak's powers. Noland is one of the locations where Queen Zixi of Ix and the movie (The Magic Cloak of Oz) take place. Zixi, Bud, and Fluff attended Ozma's birthday party in The Road to Oz.

The popularity of Dover's \\"Carolina in the Morning Show\\" on WOHS carried over to his \\"Hugh Dover Get Together\\" on WKMT. Dover would describe his 1-3pm show as an \\"informal get together with the radio audience in which we play southern gospel music, put on information about school, civic, and church activities, as well as entertaining our sick and shut in friends.\\" Dover continued with WKMT until his death in 1998.

Jim Arp would remain as a DJ after more than 35 years. When Kevin and Kris Geddings switched the format of WXNC radio to talk, they announced WKMT would change to a simulcast of most of WXNC's programming. This would allow programming such as CNN News to be heard at night in some areas when WXNC was off the air.Mark Washburn, \\"New Station Offers a Different Sort of Talk - AM Format Focuses on Lifestyle Programming,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 14, 2005.

In April 2006, CRN completed the purchase of WKMT from Geddings & Phillips Broadcasting. The station's signal was 1000 watts during the day and 106 watts at night. An increase to 25,000 watts during the day was planned, with an eventual signal improvement at night. Jon Robinson, former co-host of \\"Charlotte's Morning News\\" on WBT, and Liz Luke, previously an anchor on the WWMG morning show, co-hosted the first morning show, \\"Think Mornings.\\" Robinson said the station would focus on solutions to problems rather than just talking about them. Luke said the station would do \\"adult humor\\" but that the material would be clean and make people think. She also said the station would not be Christian, but there would be a spiritual component. Charlotte radio production veteran John Moore was brought on board as producer and Senior Technical Director. CRN executive vice president Casey Shannon said the station would be an alternative to 50,000-watt WBT, targeting listeners over 25. Fontana hosted the afternoon show and a financial advice show called \\"THINK Money\\" at noon. He was already doing an early afternoon show on WKMT from CRN studios at Fourth and College Streets in Charlotte, which was distributed by Charis Radio Network and was being aired on iLifeTV on cable. The power increase was approved in March 2007. At that time the station announced plans to affiliate with ABC Radio and to add comedian Dennis Miller in the late morning. Also, Bill O'Reilly would replace Fontana's early afternoon show.Mark Washburn, \\"Radio Station Adding Towers - Federal Regulators Approve Transmitter in Gaston County,\\" The Charlotte Observer, March 28, 2007.

On August 4, 2008, the new morning lineup debuted with a move of the Danny Fontana Show from afternoons to mornings to create THINK Mornings with Danny Fontana. Molly Carroll was retained from the former morning show and has joined Bo Thompson to create \\"AM 1220 with Molly and Bo\\" from 9a-10a. There were other changes in the programming lineup as well, extending many current national syndicated shows to their full live time slot.Mark Washburn, \\"TV Reporter Follows Pull to Pulpit,\\" The Charlotte Observer, August 9, 2008. Despite adding such hosts as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity, WDYT ranked no. 21 in the ratings, and on January 26, the station told the FCC it would stop broadcasting. CRN would continue to hold the license for 30 days, and its agreement with the FCC could be extended later for a year. Fontana blamed the poor economy, which caused advertising to decline, and said the station might return with a new format, or it could even be sold.Mark Washburn, \\"Talk Radio Station Goes Off the Air,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 29, 2009. The station signed back on (in testing mode) with a Spanish format in August 2009.

In the world of samba subgenres and in samba reunions, partido alto songs (informally called partidos) can represent a time for improvisation and (humorous or not) disputes, besides a stronger singalong opportunity for the participants. Partido Alto is also the name of a particular rhythm that is derived from the above-mentioned style of samba (especially in a jazz context). The rhythm is often played in samba, and is also the basis for the Partido Alto groove, in which more or all of the instruments accent this rhythm.  Characteristics  Regarding structure, Partido Alto differentiates itself from common samba in that it is usually divided in two main parts. One is the usually static refrain (refr√£o), which is sung by a choral, which often means everyone present in a samba performance. The other part is called the verses and is often soloed by one or more participants. There can frequently be two or more versers (versadores), and that usually means that they will be competing in some way, be it humorous or not. Partido Alto's harmony is traditionally in a major key, which is often understood as a more joyous type of harmony, matching the genre's somewhat euphoric nature. Percussivelly, it presents a peculiar pandeiro beat, with strong use of a violent, dry snap created by hitting the center of the head with the palm of the hand; thus nylon-skinned pandeiros are more common here than in others genres, although Partido Alto uses organic-skins just as much. The name of the genre can, among other meanings, be understood as a reference to this percussive property; one of the possible literal translations would be \\"broken high\\", which could be thought of as \\"highly broken\\". thumbnail  History  Partido Alto has its origins in the religious parties in rural communities where jongo was played, a type of music very rooted in Africa, accompanied by drums called candongueiros, angumativas and caxambus. It has been present in samba from the beginning; there are songs which are considered partidos dated from the 1930s. There's a traditional jongo nucleus around the samba school Imp√©rio Serrano in Rio de Janeiro, which is active to this day. Thus it is no wonder that a very important artist in the genre, Aniceto do Imp√©rio, came from there. He and Nilton Campolino released very late in their career, in 1977, their first record, when Aniceto counted 65 years. Other precursors of the music include Candeia and the legendary Geraldo Bab√£o from the samba-schools Portela and Salgueiro. Further famous partido alto musicians include Clementina de Jesus, Jovelina P√©rola Negra, Xang√¥ da Mangueira, Bezerra da Silva and Candeia; these can be thought of as the genre's roots. More recent musicians of the such as Grupo Fundo de Quintal, Zeca Pagodinho, Almir Guineto, Trio Calafrio and Arlindo Cruz are, among other things, exponents of the genre, although they don't restrain themselves to it. Examples of prominent songs which can classified as partido alto are the famous \\"N√£o Vem (Assim N√£o D√°)\\", from the classic record \\"Quatro Grandes do Samba\\", where Candeia, Elton Medeiros, Nelson Cavaquinho and Guilherme de Brito share the verses, and \\"Perdoa\\", by Paulinho da Viola, where he and Elton Medeiros share the verses. Partido Alto has been documented in the film of the same name by Leon Hirszman.

It won the 2006 Dilys Award. Plot summary When the Malay Black bear vanishes from its cage in the zoo garden of Vientiane's Lan Xang Hotel very few people are surprised to see mauled bodies turning up in the morgue. Very few that is, apart from Dr. Siri Phaiboun the only coroner in the Lao People's Republic. Seventy-two-year-old Siri and his team are convinced something just doesn't add up. In Luang Prabang, meanwhile, plans are afoot to finally rid the country of its royal heritage. The new socialist government is about to send the royal family to a re-education camp and exorcise the spirits of the old kings. Siri is sent to the historic capital to solve two mysteries: what killed a man found on a crumpled bicycle, and what caused the deaths of two bodies charred beyond recognition and missing their feet? What is so important that a military helicopter should be provided to whisk him north at a moment's notice? Once there, Siri calls on his spiritual connections to help solve these cases. But he reawakens the souls of the phibob, the malevolent ghosts still seeking revenge on the doctor for past misdeeds. He enlists the help of the royal shaman and finally learns the true intentions of the phibob and of his own distinguished dynasty. Before he can return to his work he has to survive the phibob attempt on his life, unmask the betrayer of the king and argue his own defense against charges of treachery. With Siri out of town, it is left to Dtui his nursing assistant to investigate the killings in Vientiane. She has her first unpleasant encounter with a Russian circus trainer, gets access to secret Party files, and soon becomes the only person in Laos arguing against the death warrant on the old Malay bear. But whilst searching for who or whatever it is murdering women and draining them of their blood, Dtui disappears. With the moon full, and three victims already on the morgue slab, Dr. Siri has four hours to find his assistant before she becomes the fourth.

This ecumenical creed is today recited in the liturgies of the Catholic Church (both Latin and Eastern Rites), the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Church of the East, the Moravian Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Methodist Churches, the Presbyterian Churches, the Anglican Communion and by members of many Reformed churches. While many doctrines, based on both tradition and different interpretations of the Bible, distinguish one denomination from another, largely explaining why there are so many different ones, the Four Marks, when defined the same way, represent a summary of what many clerical authorities have historically considered to be the most important affirmations of the Christian faith.  History  The ideas behind the Four Marks have been in the Christian Church since early Christianity. Allusions to them can be found in the writings of 2nd-century early Church Father and bishop Ignatius of Antioch. They were not established in doctrine until the First Council of Constantinople in 381 as an antidote to certain heresies that had crept into the Church in its early history. There the Council elaborated on the Nicene Creed, established by the First Council of Nicea 56 years before by adding to the end a section that included the affirmation: \\"[We believe] in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.\\"Creeds of Christendom The phrase has remained in versions of the Nicene Creed to this day. In some languages, for example, German, the Latin \\"catholica\\" was substituted by \\"Christian\\" before the Reformation by some, though this was an anomalySee footnote 12 in The Book of Concord, Translators Kolb, R. and Wengert, T. Augsburg Fortress, 2000, p. 22. and continues in use by some Protestant churches today. Hence, \\"holy catholic\\" becomes \\"holy Christian.\\"For example, see Lutheran Service Book. Concordia Publishing House, 2006, p. 158. Roman Catholics believe the description \\"one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church\\" to be applicable only to the Roman Catholic Church. They hold that \\"Christ established here on earth only one Church\\" and they believe in \\"the full identity of the Church of Christ with the Catholic Church\\". While \\"there are numerous elements of sanctification and of truth which are found outside her structure\\", these, \\"as gifts properly belonging to the Church of Christ, impel towards Catholic Unity\\". The eastern Churches not in full communion with the Catholic Church thereby \\"lack something in their condition as particular Churches\\". The communities born out of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation \\"do not enjoy apostolic succession in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constituent element of the Church.\\"Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Responses to some questions regarding certain aspects of the doctrine of the Church The Eastern Orthodox Church, in disagreement with the Roman Catholic, regards itself as the historical and organic continuation of the original Church founded by Christ and his apostles.Bishop Kallistos (Ware). The Orthodox Church. Penguin Books. . p. 307 The Oriental Orthodox Church disagrees with both and claims to be the historical and organic continuation of the original Church founded by Christ and his apostles, the \\"One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic\\" Church of the ancient Christian creeds and the only Church that has always kept the true Christology and faith declared by the first three councils, Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus affirmed by the Church Fathers and the Holy Tradition. The Augsburg Confession found within the Book of Concord, a compendium of belief of the Lutheran Churches, teaches that \\"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church.\\" When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530, they believe to have \\"showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils.\\" As such, the Lutheran Churches traditionally hold that theirs represents the true visible Church.  Marks  =One= \\"There is one body and one Spirit just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\\" This list in the Pauline letters of factors making Christians one body, one church, is doubtless not meant to be exhaustive, says Francis Aloysius Sullivan, but it affirms the oneness of the body, the church, through what Christians have in common, what they have communion in. Elsewhere, Paul the Apostle says: \\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\\" (). This statement was about Christians as individuals, but it applied to them also as groups, as local churches, whether composed mainly of Jewish or Gentile Christians. In , Paul spoke of himself as having persecuted \\"the church of God\\", not just the local church in Jerusalem but the same church that he addresses at the beginning of that letter as \\"the church of God that is in Corinth\\" (). In the same letter, he tells Christians: \\"You are the body of Christ and individually members of it\\" (), and declares that, \\"just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ\\" ().Francis Aloysius Sullivan, The Church We Believe In (Paulist Press 1988 ), pp. 36‚Äì38 = Holy = The word holy means set apart for a special purpose by and for God. Christians understand the holiness of the universal Church to derive from Christ's holiness.Whitehead, Kenneth D. \\"The Church of the Apostles,\\" This Rock, March 1995. See article at ewtn.com =Catholic= The word \\"catholic\\" is derived from the Greek adjective (katholikos), meaning \\"general\\", \\"universal\\".(cf. Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon) It is associated with the Greek adverb (katholou), meaning \\"according to the whole\\", \\"entirely\\", or \\"in general\\", a combination of the preposition meaning \\"according to\\" and the adjective meaning \\"whole\\".\\"On Being Catholic \\", by Claire Anderson M.Div. Applied to the church, the adjective \\"catholic\\" means that in the church the wholeness of the Christian faith, full and complete, all-embracing, and with nothing lacking, is proclaimed to all people without excluding any part of the faith or any class or group of people.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 830-856 The adjective can be applied not only to the church as spread throughout the world but also to each local manifestation of the church, in each of which nothing essential is lacking for it to be the genuine Church of Christ. For his subjects, Emperor Theodosius I restricted the term \\"catholic christians\\" to believers in \\"the one deity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity\\", and applied the name \\"heretics\\" to others (Edict of Thessalonica of 27 February 380).Henry Bettenson (editor), Documents of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 1970 ), p. 22 In the following year 381, the First Council of Constantinople adopted the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, expressing belief in \\"one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church\\". =Apostolic= This describes the Church's foundation and beliefs as rooted and continuing in the living Tradition of the Apostles of Jesus.Cf. also an Armenian statement, a Roman Catholic statement. The Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East each claim to have preserved the original teaching of the apostles. They also have apostolic succession in that their bishops derive their authority through a direct line of laying on of hands from the apostles, a claim that they accept can be made by the other churches in this group. The Anglican Communion, as well as many Lutheran Churches such as the Church of Sweden, likewise teach the doctrine of apostolic succession. Other Christian denominations, on the other hand, usually hold that what preserves apostolic continuity is the written word: as Bruce Milne put it, \\"A church is apostolic as it recognizes in practice the supreme authority of the apostolic scriptures.\\"Bruce Milne, \\"Know the Truth\\" (2nd edition).

Years ago Angela had declared that because Meg was tainted by a demon, it was best for young Meg to die so that she could go to heaven. Young Meg wanted so much to live that Angela relented and took Meg under her protection.

Michael Quinn, \\"Plural Marriage and Mormon Fundamentalism\\", in Martin E. Marty and R. Scott Appleby (eds.) (1991). Fundamentalism and Society: Reclaiming the Sciences, the Family, and Education (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, ) pp. 240‚Äì290 at p. 286 n. 61. was an American outspoken polygamist and founder of the Confederate Nations of Israel, a Mormon fundamentalist sect. As mayor of Big Water, Utah, Joseph was the first Libertarian Party mayor of a community in the United States. Mormon fundamentalism Joseph was not raised in the Greek Orthodox Church, but was baptized into it in his late teens. He became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1965. In 1969, he abandoned the LDS Church and briefly joined a group of Mormon fundamentalists under the leadership of Rulon C. Allred in Pinesdale, Montana. In time, he convinced four students at the University of Montana to marry him and become his plural wives. His wives were not Latter Day Saints; rather, two were Roman Catholics, one was a Methodist, and one was a Presbyterian.D. Michael Quinn, \\"Plural Marriage and Mormon Fundamentalism\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 31, no. 2, pp. 22‚Äì23. The parents of the students were outraged and confronted Allred with their displeasure. Allred was displeased that Joseph had married without his permission, and after Joseph pointed out that Allred had also taken multiple wives,Sara Davidson, \\"The Man with Ten Wives\\" retrieved 2-Nov-2010 Joseph was asked to leave the colony in Montana.Dorothy Allred Solomon (2003). Predators, Prey, and Other Kinfolk: Growing Up in Polygamy (New York: W. W. Norton) p. 287. Joseph's exposure to Mormon fundamentalist groups eventually led him to see them as oppressive and corrupt. \\"Atrocities are committed and people have no recourse because they're outside the law, like the Mafia\\", commented Joseph. From then on, Joseph followed his own Christian-based religious convictions. Elizabeth Joseph, one of Alex Joseph's wives who served as Big Water City Attorney and an instructor at Coconino Community College, was a featured speaker at the Utah NOW conference in 1997.Julie Ann Kessler An Immodest Proposal Women's Quarterly, Summer 1997 =Polygamy= Joseph's style of polygamy was formed out of his own reading of the Bible, and contrasted with that practised by some other Mormon fundamentalists in some notable ways. First, his wives entered into their marriages of their own accord, initiative and free will, rather than being designated by a paternal authority. Second, his wives were encouraged to be very independent. Third, he was open about his polygamist lifestyle rather than being secretive, and welcomed media coverage, believing that it is his constitutional right and because \\"he wants public opinion on his side\\". Big Water and Confederate Nations of Israel Joseph and his wives moved to Kane County, Utah to a deserted settlement known as Glen Canyon City; Joseph renamed the settlement Big Water in 1983. Joseph became the first mayor of the newly renamed settlement. In 1977, he organized the Church of Jesus Christ in Solemn Assembly and the Confederate Nations of Israel, a hybrid church‚Äìpolitical organization modelled after Mormonism's Council of Fifty.Alex Joseph: The Confederate Nations of Israel MormonFundamentalism.com Libertarian mayor In April 1986, Joseph made news when he abandoned the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party and by so doing became the first American mayor to be a member of the Libertarian Party.\\"Alex Joseph, first LP mayor, dies at 62\\", Libertarian Party News, Dec. 1998. Joseph also convinced the four other members of the town council to join the Libertarians, thereby creating America's first \\"Libertarian Party town government\\" in Big Water. The Libertarian government abolished all taxes on real estate in the town. Joseph stepped down as mayor in 1994 after serving three consecutive terms. Occupations, family and death At different times in his life, Joseph was employed as a U.S. Marine, a police officer, a firefighter, a mail carrier, a car salesman, an accountant, an author of books, a health food producer, a private investigator, and a manager for country and western music performers. He also starred in a movie about himself known as Alex Joseph and His Wives. He requested that his occupation on his death certificate be listed as \\"pirate\\". Although it has been estimated that he may have married up to twenty women at various times, Joseph was survived by seven wives and 14 biological children, as well as several adopted or fostered children. He died of liver cancer at the age of 62. Notes References * Brian C. Hales (2006).

Hazen's Notch was named after Moses Hazen, who in 1779 led the construction of the Bayley Hazen Military Road. The road was planned to extend from Newbury, Vermont, to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, not far from Montreal, to facilitate an invasion of Canada during the American Revolutionary War; it had reached this point when construction stopped.Hazen Military Road, F.W. Baldwin, The Vermonter, Vol. XI, No. 16, White River Junction, Vermont, November 1906, pages 297-323. The notch is defined by the cliffs of Sugarloaf Mountain to the north and by Haystack Mountain to the south. The height of land of the pass is located in Hazen's Notch State Park, in Orleans County, about east of the boundary between Orleans and Franklin Counties. Located on the south side of the road at the height of land in Hazen's Notch is a stone tablet inscribed with the words \\"Terminus of the Hazen Road, 1779\\" which was placed there by the Orleans County Historical Society on August 21, 1903. The geology of the Hazen's Notch area in Westfield and Montgomery is primarily Hazen's Notch Formation of schist with intrusions of Belvidere Mountain Amphibolite and two areas of ultramafic rocks all of which grades into Jay Peak Formation in the lower elevations.Hazen's Notch Association, Hazen's Notch, Vermont, A Natural History. On the east side, Hazen's Notch drains into the East Branch of the Missisquoi River, which drains into Lake Champlain, thence into Canada's Richelieu River, the Saint Lawrence River, and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. To the west, the gap is drained by Wade Brook, which drains into the Trout River, thence the Missisquoi River. The Long Trail, a 272-mile (438-km) hiking trail running the length of Vermont, crosses Hazen's Notch between Haystack Mountain, 1.5 mi (2.5 km) to the south, and Sugarloaf Mountain immediately to the north.

Due to UCLA's immense success under Wooden's guidance, the UCLA High Post Offense has become one of the most popular offensive tactics, and elements of it are commonly used on all levels of basketball including the NBA. Wooden sought the advice of Press Maravich, then coach of NC State, whether to implement it into his offense. The UCLA High Post Offense is flexible in its ability to use the strengths of most players on the floor. This man-to-man offense is designed to take full advantage of a center with good passing, shooting and one-on-one skills out of the high post, but it can also take advantage of the post up abilities of either guard and forward. It is commonly run out of the 2-2-1, 4-out/1-in set (also known as a two-guard front), but can also be initiated out of a 1-4 set with a variety of entries. The two-guard front keeps the pressure off a team's playmaker from having the ball in his hands all the time, as well as allowing the offense to be initiated from either side of the floor and giving either guard an opportunity to run the side-post game. The UCLA High Post offense can be run to both sides of the court, and has a variety of options or \\"reads\\". It is a near relative of Tex Winter's triangle offense, featuring a three-man triangle game on the strong side and a two-man game on the weak side. Its strengths include simplicity, superb offensive rebounding coverage, a weak-side attack, consistent spacing, flexibility based on personnel and the ability to penetrate the defense. However, due to the presence of a strong-side high-low-wing triangle formation, the ability to penetrate with the dribble is highly limited.

It is famous for its 280 petroglyphs dating from 4000-1000 BC. The exhibition also includes reconstructions of ancient dwellings as well as some later cultural artefacts pertaining to the Shors people.  About the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\"  In 2008 historical, cultural and natural museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" celebrated the 20-year anniversary. This unique museum was founded in accordance with the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of Russian Federation of February 16, 1988. But it took efforts of dozens of people, who devoted their life to study and protection of the world-famous primitive skill monument in different times, for this solution to take place. Rock with the drawings of ancient people on the Tom River bank was opened at the turn of the 16th century. This rock has been attracting the attention of researchers through the ages. The descriptions of the rock are contained in the works of well-known scholars and travellers from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries: Stralenberg, Miller, Spasskiy and many others. In the middle of 20th century the Soviet researchers Okladnikov, Martynov, Bobrov, Borodkin, Bigler continued the study of Tomsk petroglyphs. The completing stage of these long- term investigations is the work of A. P. Okladnikov and A.I. Martynov \\"The treasures of Tomsk Pisanitsy\\" (1972), and also articles in academic periodicals in the USSR and abroad. Science did its part, scientists helped contemporaries to understand the sense of life and the world view of ancient people, but they could not protect this monument from the natural destruction and from the vandals. The group of scientists, teachers and students under the guidance of professor A. I. Martynov constituted the unique rock saving staff. Thanks to these people, the first restoration of monument was carried out, the famous stairs, which is today the main descent to the rock, were built, a public awareness campaign by publications, by radio and telecasts was launched, first excursions were organized. In 1968 the territory around the Tomskaya pisanitsa was declared a preserved area, and to the middle of the 80th, no one had doubts that the Tomskaya pisanitsa must become the museum. The professional ethnographer Dr. V. M. Kimeyev had headed the new museum- preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\". The bases of the museum functioning were laid at that time: the professional team of likeminded people was created, preservation zones and general plan of museum complex development were affirmed, the survey of locality was carried out and the output of advertising and souvenir production was set. The first comprehensive expeditions for funds acquisition and Russian and Shor (indigenous population of Tom's Region) traditional culture studying were carried out; the foundation of the formation of the ethnographical museum expositions \\"Shor ulus Kezek\\" and \\"Russian Siberian village\\" was laid. From 1989 to 1991 as a result of archaeological expeditions downstream on the river Tom the research assistants of museum discovered new drawings on the rocks. From 1991 to November 2004 Dr. G. S. Martynova headed the museum. This period in the history of museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" is marked by the appearance of new expositions, by the organization of scientific conferences and seminars. In 1995 museum-preserve organized international conference on the problems of ancient Rock Art and the archaeological complex \\"Archaedrom\\" and the Museum of the petroglyphs of Asia, which is today the largest Russian depository of the central Asian Rock Art collections, were opened. In 1996‚Äî1997 the expositions \\"Mythology and epos of Siberian peoples\\", \\"Slavonic mythology forest\\" were created and in 2000 exhibition complexes \\"Time and calendars\\" and \\"Living archaeology\\" were created. In the second half of the 90th the museum-preserve begins to take active part in the competitions and the museum forums and it gains acceptance in Russia and abroad: * 1995 ‚Äî the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" was included in the President's list \\"The particularly valuable objects of the cultural heritage of the Russian Federation\\"; * 1997 ‚Äî diploma of International museum biennale in Krasnoyarsk; * December 1998 ‚Äî the victory of I.

Since 2004 up to now the director of the museum-preserve is V. A. Kaplunov. In 2005 the reconstruction of museum- preserve was carried out. The traditions, established during the years of the museum formation, have got a new shot in the arm: * 2005 ‚Äî the official representative of the project \\"Velikiy Ustyug is Father Frost's native land\\"; * 2006, 2008 and 2009 ‚Äî the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" was the winner of Kemerovo region's competition \\"The best museum\\"; * 2006, 2007 and 2009 ‚Äî grants of the President of the Russian Federation; * 2009, 2010 ‚Äî the web-site of the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" was the winner of the competition \\"Golden site\\"; * 2010 ‚Äî the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" got the honorary title \\"National patrimony of Russia\\". Today Museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" is a rapidly developing modern multiprofile cultural complex, which successfully combines museum specific character, scientific and cultural public awareness activity. Within 23 years, almost grassroots, it became the real museum of the 21st century and it is an honor for Kuzbass by right. Now the museum staff consists of more than 60 people, who work in the different departments: funds, excursions and tourism, science and exhibition, restoration and building, administrative and operational. Museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" is the favorite resting place of Kuzbass inhabitants and guests. The politicians, businessmen, the representatives of culture and science, who stay in Kuzbass with business visits, attend Tomskaya pisanitsa. In different years the museum was visited by many famous compatriots and worldwide famous celebrities, among them: multiple world chess champion Anatoly Karpov, cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, singers Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Valentina Tolkunova, famous traveller Yuri Senkevich, actor Pierre Richard and many others.  Ancient sanctuary \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\"  A view of the Tom river in the Tomskaya Pisanitsa museum Tomskaya pisanitsa is situated on the right bank of the river Tom. Here the nature has created a unique place ‚Äî smooth vertical stones and a small platform before them, a kind of scene. Ancient people could not but use this gift of nature. They have transformed this place into a sanctuary where they came to pray to the Gods, to ask them for successful hunting. The lead character of Tom's Rock Art is beautiful elk. Elks were not only objects of prey, they turned into objects of worship, into concentration of vital forces and power. About hundred figures of these animals are knocked out on the Tomskaya pisanitsa. Also we can see drawings of others representatives of fauna: bears, the fox, the wolf, birds. Many anthropomorphous images are on the Tomskaya Pisanitsa. These are schematic drawings of people, often wearing animal masks. Among the images solar signs are knocked out. The majority of the images of the Tomskaya pisanitsa date from the aeneolithic period and Bronze Age, 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. Drawings of boats and fantastic animals attract special interest. Many peoples of the world associate a boat with the idea of their relative's voyage down \\"the river of the dead\\", i.e. to the next world. As a whole the basic idea of the sanctuary is the idea of fertility. The sanctuary served people during several millenniums. And today interest in this memorial has not weakened. Thousands of tourists come here to get acquainted with creativity of our remote ancestors.  The architectural-ethnographical complex \\"Shor ulus Kezek\\"  \\"The Shor ulus Kezek\\" is the authentic complex of Shors' dwellings and household buildings of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, consisting of a dwelling \\"Em\\", a summer kitchen \\"Senek\\", a barn \\"Aimorok\\", a smithy, a bath- house \\"Melcha\\", a calf-house, a pigsty, a henhouse and a stable. At the end of the 19th century single-room izbas and five-wall huts borrowed from Russians became prevalent winter dwellings of the Shors. Along with these a log yurta \\"Senek\\" was also widely spread. Next to the farm a Shorian wedding hut ‚Äî \\"green yourta\\", is reconstructed. It is traditionally utilized during the wedding as the ritual dwelling of fiance and bride. The exposition \\"The house of shaman\\" (traditional timbered yourta is used), where the attributes of Shorian shaman and his mannequin are represented, tells about the pre- Christian beliefs of Shors. On the whole, the complex exposition reflexes traditional material and spiritual culture of the Tatars of Kuznetsk, and also the influence of Russian culture and way of life. Museum conditions allow showing the monuments of material and spiritual culture of the peoples in realistic situations.  \\"Mythology and epos of Siberian peoples\\"  Mythological field in Tomskaya Pisanitsa museum Myth-making is a very important phenomenon of the Siberian peoples spiritual history. It is a way of explanation and comprehension of the world, a primary form of human spiritual culture. Epos originates from myths as a form of collective verbal folk art. The epos of nationalities characterized by late appearance of written language and literature is especially plentiful. Siberian peoples belong to this category. The philosophy and the mythology of the nationality, its notions about the Universe, the unity of Man and Nature are reflected in epos. The museum complex is situated on the cultic hill above the sanctuary \\"Tomskaya pisanitsa\\" and includes a gallery of ancient cult sculptures, a sacred tree and commemoration places of different epochs. The purpose of exposition is to show the history of Siberian peoples at different times through the demonstration of their ideological conceptions. It includes the following objects: the \\"sacred tree\\", the sculptural means of mythology (sculpture mockups of the Bronze Age ‚Äî early Iron Age), credences of different time, the sacred rock altars and the cult places of Siberian peoples. This complex is fully based on historical reconstructions.  \\"Archaedrom\\" and \\"Living archaeology\\"  The \\"Archaedrom\\" complex ‚Äî the reconstruction of the ancient dwellings and burial places. \\"Archaedrom\\" is the concentrated show of archaeology. It consists of the natural area reconstructions of ancient houses of the Siberian peoples of the Bronze Age, the early Iron Age and the Middle Ages, pavilion of natural burials. \\"Living archaeology\\". The reconstruction of the ancient technology: metal-smelting, bone-processing, pottery, loom- knitting, javelin-throwing and archery.  \\"Slavonic mythology forest\\"  \\"Slavonic mythology forest\\" ‚Äî the reconstruction of pagan sanctuaries. The exposition opened in 1997. The settlement of the Siberian lands has started since the beginning of 17th century according to the plans of Russian government and today in the popular majority of Siberia are the Russians. The influence of the pre-Christian layer of Slav culture was determining in the formation of Russian orthodox tradition. Before the adoption of Christianity the Slavs were heathens and they carried out rites in heathen temples. At present the scientists agreed to consider the heathen temple as the place of devotions. One of the most interesting heathen sanctuaries is the sanctuary of Perun near Veliky Novgorod in Peryn district on Il'men lake. The heathen temple erected at \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" is the halved reconstruction of this sanctuary. A platform is paved with flagstone to make the inspection more convenient. For the same purpose the ditch is substituted with stones lined on the edge of lobes. On the exposition in the center of the heathen temple there is a copy of the Zbruch idol. The Zbruch idol is the 10th-century sculpture. This is one of the rare monuments of Slav heathen cult, which was found near Gusyatin village in river Zbruch (inflow of Dniester) in 1848. After the adoption of Christianity it was probably thrown into the water (like the idols of Perun in Kiev and Novgorod). Zbruch idol is a tetrahedral column with three tiers of patterns: in the lower underground deity is depicted, on the average there are the earth and people, in the upper ‚Äî the sky and gods (attributes of the main god are a horse and a sword). The head of Zbruch idol has 4 faces: Mokosh, Lada, Perun and supposedly Dazhdbog, it is covered with the Russian princely cap (spherical cap with fur edge). Slavs kindled ritual fires in the heathen temples. These bonfires were started from the \\"living fire\\" ‚Äî a need- fire. The construction for the fire obtaining is represented at the exposition. Around the heathen temple there are located the mockups of the main Slav idols: Rod ‚Äî the ancestor of the universe, Rozhanitsy the celestial mistresses of the world, Veles ‚Äî \\"skotiy god\\" (god of cattle), Rugiewit ‚Äî the god of war and the judge of souls in the afterworld, Svarog ‚Äî the father of the sun god, Svetovid ‚Äî fertility god, Chur ‚Äî the guard of boundaries, Yarilo ‚Äî the deity of the sun and fertility. The heathen temple is enclosed circle- wise with a wooden paling, on which the skulls of sacrificial animals are hanged. Circle and oval are magic figures for the Slavs. Atheartical excursion \\"Perun warrior initiation\\" is conducted on the exposition.  The museum of Asian Rock Art  A fragment of ancient man's picture at Tomskaya Pisanitsa Rock Art is a large part of the world history, culture and art. It reflects outlook of our ancestors. By the example of Rock Art we can understand the way of ancient people's life. Therefore, each memorial of Rock Art is of great interest not only for scientists, but also for everyone who is interested in history and art. One can visit individual rock art memorials, but because of their specific nature and hard accessibility it is impossible to examine such a memorial as a whole, to see it as a work of art, as a sphere of human spiritual life. Toward this end we have established the first Russian museum of Asian rock art. Its exposition displays the most typical complexes of Eurasia rock art. The basis of the museum is formed with genuine material from Siberia, Far East, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Korea, China, India, Pakistan and others. In the museum you can see Neolithic art (4th-3rd millennia BC), the art of the Bronze Age (late 3rd ‚Äî early 1st millennia BC), the art of the Iron Age (7th century BC ‚Äî early 1st millennium AD), the art of the Middle Ages (the second half of the 1st millennium AD) and the rock art of 18th and 19th centuries. Now the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" is the largest depository of Asian Rock Art collections in Russia.  Museum of Natural History (historical geology, mineralogy, paleontology)  Open show of material on historical geology and mineralogy of Kuzbass and Tom river region. The examples of coal are presented here. Also there is exhibition material on paleontology.  Museum complex \\"Time and calendars\\"  A museum complex \\"Time and calendars\\" demonstrates the organic unity: space ‚Äî nature ‚Äî time ‚Äî man ‚Äî calendar. Museum \\"Time and calendars\\" opened in August 2000, at the start of millennium. At the exhibition there are represented the calendar systems of different ages and countries. They are placed against \\"the wall of time\\", on which the main events of human history are shown.  Architectural and ethnographic complex \\"Russian Siberian village\\"  On the territory of the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\", on the basis of architectural monuments of Pisanaya village and transported buildings the work on the creation of a historic-ethnographical exposition complex \\"Russian Siberian village\\" is in hand. \\"Russian Siberian village\\" is situated near the museum on the territory of village Pisanaya. Pisanaya village was founded in the middle of 17th century. In 2006 the first exposition of the complex ‚Äî \\"Siberian Yasak Zimovye\\" was opened. It consists of a housing tower and a barn modeled after buildings of 17th century.  \\"Mongolian yurt\\"  The prefabricated felt yurt satisfies the conditions of Mongolian nomadism. It takes a heavy load of a wind thanks to the streamline contour. The cover from white felt is pressed to the wooden skeleton with hair rope. In the center of the yurt there is a fireplace. A floor is covered with felt and there is placed a felt carpet over it. The man's half of the yurt is on the left hand of the entrance. The interior of the yurt has a rich color scheme. The furniture and wooden structures are painted red or orange and ornamented. The entrance of the yurt overlooks south. Proportions of the yurt recreate the model of a sundial. An exact time of day is defined according to a place of solar beam falling in the yurt. The internal yurt layout is divided conditionally into 12 parts according to the cycle of calendar chronology. The parts are named after months of east calendar. The yurt was received as a gift of the Governor of the Kemerovo region A. G. Tuleev in 2000.  The \\"Fairy tale\\" zone where is the residence of Siberian Father Frost in winter  In the exposition there are presented the main characters of Russian fairy tales; in winter the \\"Residence of Father Frost\\" is open. In December, 2005 the Russian Father Frost from Veliky Ustyug visited Kuzbass. He had presented credentials about the fact that the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" is the representation of the Russian Father Frost in the Kemerovo region. An opportunity to have a rest in preserved corner of Kuzbass for the whole family, to see expositions, to visit a minizoo and to take part in the game program with children became a good tradition of the townspeople. The Kuzbass Father Frost gives children the certificate, which says that they have visited his Residence. There also works the mail of Father Frost. The children of all region write letters to the Kuzbass Father Frost. The Residence works from December till March.  The nature of the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\"  Minizoo in Tomskaya Pisanitsa museum A pine forest occupies about 90% of the preserve territory. Along the river Pisanaya one can see bushwoods of flood plain willow beds. Stony southern slopes of the bedrock Tom bank are covered with steppe plants. Here one can meet such plants as Pteridium aquilinum, Aegopodium podagraria, Carex macroura, Lilium martagon, Adenophora liliifolia, Pyrda media, dozens of meadow grass species. Steppe vegetation includes such rare for the region plants as Dianthus versicolor, Viola rupestris, Allium nutans, Festuca valessiaca, Stipa capillata, Thymus serpyllium. The fauna of the museumpreserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" is also varied. An ancient moose path leading to a ford across the Tom intersects the preserve and mooses frequently go along it. In winter one can meet wolves and lynxes here. Foxes, minks, kolinskies, ermines, weasels, badgers, hares, squirrels, chipmunks are the museum-preserve residents. There are many small rodents here ‚Äî mice and voles, 3 species of bats, shrews. The fauna of birds is very diverse, it consists of about 150 species. Among them 60 species are nesting, the rest are transit and wintering. In summer one's attention can be attracted by vultures gliding over the river, chaffinches singing in the forest, wagtails running along the bank. Here one can meet large falcons which are registered in the Red Book of Russia. In winter one can meet bullfinches, waxwings, polar owls. During all seasons the forest is alive with numerous tomtits, woodpeckers and nuthatches. Two species of poisonous snakes inhabit the territory of the museum-preserve ‚Äî the ordinary adder and the copperhead, the viviparous and the agile lizards, the gray toad and the pointed-muzzled frog. On the territory of \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" one can see plenty of varied insects, spiders, mollusks. There is a mini-zoo on the territory of the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\". It is the only stationary zoo in Kemerovo region. As an adoptive parent's of our animals, your gift will be directed to the zoo's animal care. Museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" appreciates to all organizations and private persons who have shown sincere interest and active participation in fate of the zoo's animals.  Sts. Kirill and Methodius Chapel  The idea to build the wooden chapel in the museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\" belongs to Kuzbass' Governor A. Tuleev. It was built in 2008. This chapel was named in honor of Sts. Kirill and Methodius. Sts. Kirill and Methodius created the bases of Slav written language, literature, science, culture. They translated the Bible, sacred and chapel books to Slav language. Sts. Kirill and Methodius Chapel is unique: its height is 33 meters, it was built according to the canons of Old- Russian architecture of the best types of wood (pine and larch).  The Holidays  During the activity of museum-preserve the holiday culture became its integral part. The largest holidays are Christmas, Shrovetide, Easter, Whitsun and Ivan Kupala Day (Feast of St. John the Baptist). In March 2006 the holiday \\"Chyl-Pazhi\\" took place in the territory of museum for the first time. This is the New Year of the Sayan-Altai region peoples. \\"Chyl-Pazhi\\" is the national holiday of the peoples of the Sayan-Altai (which include Shors and Teleuts, native residents of the Kuzbass), in Russian translation it is \\"the head of year\\". The first rays of \\"new sun\\" fall on this head in the days of the vernal equinox. In the past this holiday opened new life cycle and it was particularly significant for the peoples of the Sayan-Altai. Traditional Festival of bell ringers \\"Rings over Tom\\" takes place in the day of Whitsun. Day of animal protection is grandly celebrated on 4 October in the museum- preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\". \\"The bear mutuel\\" is the new project of Kemerovo region administration, hockey club \\"Kuzbas\\" and museum-preserve \\"Tomskaya Pisanitsa\\". It has attracted attention of the public. Pigeon-toed zoo inhabitants predicted events of bandy matches. The realization of folklore holidays on the territory of the museum is an old tradition. The preservation of the original folk culture and the acquaintance with it of the mass audience, is undoubtedly the significant moment in the work of museum.

The film was an adaptation of 1995 Hollywood film The Usual Suspects and received mixed reviews. Plot Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, an explosion in a motorboat shatters the peace on Christmas Eve in London, UK. Following this incident is a daring robbery on an armoured vehicle carrying billions of pounds. The police suspect two Indians: Pipi (Irrfan Khan) and Sim (Tanushree Dutta). They are interrogated extensively amidst allegations that they may be linked to Al- Qaeda. Crime journalist Monsoon Iyer (Sushma Reddy) learns about their plight, meets them, and asks advocate Krishan Pundit (Anil Kapoor) to represent them in court. Krishan meets with the two, listens to their side of the incidents, is convinced of their innocence, and is quite sure that the two incidents, as well as the deaths of three of Pipi and Sim's friends (Chip (Arshad Warsi), Deva (Emraan Hashmi) and Rocker (Sunil Shetty), were the actions of a notorious terrorist named Murtaza Arzai. Listening to Sim and Pipi, Krishan investigates and pieces together the story of how the three died on the boat that night at Arzai's hand. Krishan succeeds in persuading the presiding judge of their innocence, and the charges against them are dismissed and sealed. However, a fleeting glance at a magazine lying on his office table tells Krishan that the names in Sim and Pipi's story match up with names on the magazine's cover stories and the story must therefore be made up. Sim and Pipi escape scot free, to meet with Rocker, Devaa, and Chip whose supposed deaths turn out to be part of the ruse.

Jaffa, in which the authors provide an analysis of four Shakespeare plays guided by the premise that political philosophy provides a necessary perspective on the problems of Shakespeare‚Äôs heroes. Its methods and interpretations were significantly influenced by Leo Strauss, who taught Jaffa at the New School for Social Research and Bloom at the University of Chicago, and to whom the book is dedicated.  Introduction  The work opens with an introduction titled ‚ÄúPolitical Philosophy and Poetry,‚Äù in which Bloom posits a pessimistic diagnosis about the state of contemporary education. According to Bloom, students no longer see works of literature as directly relevant to their lives. Furthermore, nations no longer have a common author or authors whose work provides a standard education for the audience (in the way, for example, that Homer is celebrated in Greece or Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is in Germany). Shakespeare, Bloom argues, could still provide this education for English-speaking peoples on the grounds that his work is \\"properly read and interpreted.\\" For Bloom, this should not follow the principles of an existing school of criticism, such as New Criticism, but rather should involve students reading Shakespeare \\"naively.\\" \\"[O]nly when Shakespeare is taught as though he said something can he regain the influence over this generation which is so needed.\\" Yet there is another problem within Bloom's solution: Shakespeare's plays can only really be understood as their author intended them to be if the \\"authentic intellectual tradition in which they were written\\" is recovered. For Bloom, this means knowing how Shakespeare's Renaissance audience would have understood the historical and political context of the plays' settings, as well as understanding that its conception of political life was not the bourgeois, unpoetic subject as modernity understands it, but \\"the stage on which the broadest, deepest, and noblest passions and virtues could be played, and [where] the political man seemed to be the most interesting theme of poetry.\\"Bloom, Allan with Harry V. Jaffa. Shakespeare's Politics, 3rd ed., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981. pp. 2‚Äì5. Because the beliefs pervasive during the Renaissance are so different from ours, Bloom's concept of naivete seems to mean open-mindedness; that modern readers who turn to Shakespeare for instruction will not automatically assume that the modern conceptions of man, the state, or poetry are inherently true. For these reasons, Bloom argues, an analytical framework grounded in political philosophy, rather than literary criticism, is the proper beginning for understanding Shakespeare's plays: as professors of political philosophy, Bloom and Jaffa would be adept at this strategy of criticism.  Essays  Bloom contributes three of the four interpretive chapters of the work. In the first, \\"On Christian and Jew: The Merchant of Venice,\\" Bloom first outlines how an early 17th-century audience would have thought of Venice as a successful republic that, in its success, substitutes Biblical religion for a commercial spirit as the subject of men's passions; in this way, it was a precursor to modern liberal democratic nations.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), cf. p. 16. He later grounds his argument on the thesis that Shylock and Antonio act as representatives of Judaism and Christianity, respectively, and that it is Shylock's absolute deference to the law that necessarily brings about his downfall. In this interpretation, Bloom illustrates the limits of law as to its ability to ultimately protect and maintain justice. Shylock's equality is in the law, but his remedy in law is tragic.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), cf. p. 29. Whereas in the first essay Bloom reflects on the interfaith aspect of Venetian society, in the second, \\"Cosmopolitan Man and the Political Community: Othello,\\" Bloom reflects on its interracial nature. He argues that, in seeking to be cosmopolitan, Othello necessarily could not be considered a nobleman in Venice, where, as in any political community, the \\"careers [of hero, statesman, or soldier] are by their nature bound to the fortunes of cities of men, all of which have special needs and traditions.\\" From this Bloom concludes that Shakespeare uses the play to warn of the dangers of introducing foreign influences into a city.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), pp. 57‚Äì58. In the third essay, \\"The Morality of the Pagan Hero: Julius Caesar,\\" Bloom argues that Shakespeare's Romans are authentic (in opposition to Goethe's view that they were Englishmen),Bloom & Jaffa (1981), p. 76. and reads the play initially in contrast with Coriolanus in order to discern Caesar's populist support and godlike ambition. He then looks at Brutus's Stoicism and Cassius's Epicureanism as the motivations behind the actions of each, and concludes that Caesar is the \\"most complete man who ever lived [because he] combined the high-mindedness of the Stoic with the Epicurean's awareness of the low material substrate of political things.\\"Bloom & Jaffa (1981), p. 104. In each of his contributions, Bloom looks for a binary or set of binaries within a play, and locates in the tension within those binaries the meaning of the entire play. Examples of this are the tension between Jew and Christian in The Merchant of Venice, between citizen and cosmopolitan man in Othello, and between Stoicism and Epicureanism in Julius Caesar. Bloom also makes philosophical extrapolations from these tensions to such an extent that his evaluations of characters no longer look like the characters themselves. Jaffa's contribution, \\"The Limits of Politics: King Lear, Act I, scene i,\\" is a thorough reading of the opening scene in which Jaffa argues that Lear's love test was not irrational or vain but rather the result of Lear's sensible and profound reflection on how best to secure stability following his succession, and that the plan necessarily fails to show the audience the limits of politics: namely, the ultimate irreconcilability of truth and justice.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), cf. pp. 135‚Äì37. Jaffa also maintains that the opening of King Lear is Shakespeare's \\"presentation of the ultimate in human existence\\" as the result of a logical progression in which it is assumed that Lear is the greatest king, monarchy the greatest form of government, and that Shakespeare regarded man as a political animal.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), p. 114 =Elements of literary criticism= Although Shakespeare's Politics is mostly argued from the perspective of political philosophy, there are many instances of analysis more typical of literary criticism that shed further light on the peculiar interpretations of the work. For example, Bloom reads Biblical allusions into the four Jewish names in Merchant of Venice, finding their origin in Genesis 10 and 11, of which the latter includes the Tower of Babel narrative, underscoring the separateness of ethnic groups which is the theme of the play.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), cf. 23‚Äì24. Bloom also comments in the chapter on Othello on the duke's alternating between rhyming verse and prose as a reflection of his expediency, intending to appear moral until he is no longer on show and can attend to the pressing business.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), p. 69, n22. Furthermore, throughout the four essays Bloom and Jaffa engage the critical literature on Shakespeare by citing several past literary analyses; however, these citations are to earlier and non-contemporary figures as the Earl of Shaftesbury, John Upton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and A.C. Bradley. They refer to only one critical work from the second half of the 20th century, and they use it not for its interpretation, but for the historical context it provides.Bloom & Jaffa (1981), p. 110, n45. Critical reception Shakespeare's Politics was and is largely ignored by the literary establishment. Ronald Berman panned it in the Kenyon Review, taking issue with the Merchant of Venice chapter as \\"[having] the usual sententiousness about the problem of being Jewish...all of which was pretty well settled some 50 years ago by E.E. Stoll\\" and with the Othello chapter as \\"written in virgin ignorance of the massive scholarship.\\"Berman, Ronald. Review of Shakespeare's Politics, by Allan Bloom with Harry V. Jaffa. Kenyon Review 26, no. 3 (1965): 567. Although Bloom had written in the introduction that he and Jaffa \\"[respected] the competence of our colleagues in the literature departments and are aware of the contributions of recent scholarship,\\" Berman's remarks suggest that Bloom and Jaffa were not familiar with the full breadth of scholarship, perhaps because as the departments grew as separate entities there were too many developments in the scholarship to track, and that their work might be more useful to the discipline of political philosophy than to the discipline of literature or of literary criticism. At the same time, a positive review in Harper's Magazine argues that \\"the notion that [Shakespeare] was...a precise and passionate thinker is vigorously defended in [Bloom and Jaffa's book]\\" and that Bloom's conclusions in the chapters on Othello and Julius Caesar were strikingly similar to those reached by a contemporary work on Shakespeare (The Shakespearean Imagination, by Norman Holland) that \\"approaches the plays...in the approved new-critical way.\\"Pickrel, Paul. \\"Vision and Reality: Shakespeare to Calvin Coolidge.\\" Harper's Magazine 228, no. 1368 (1964): 114‚Äì16.

Cantor's comment both affirms that Shakespeare had a purpose in carefully constructing the political setting of his plays, and suggests that only those outside the discipline of literary criticism can inform those aspects of a literary work that address supra-literary topics. From this it can be inferred that specialists outside of literary studies can enrich the scholarship on a subject as literary as Shakespeare through discipline-specific contributions.

Definition  See or for more information. Suppose that :W\\\\stackrel{f}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } X\\\\stackrel{g}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } Y\\\\stackrel{h}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } Z is a sequence of maps between spaces, such that the compositions g\\\\circ f and h\\\\circ g are both nullhomotopic. Given a space A, let CA denote the cone of A. Then we get a (non-unique) map : F\\\\colon CW\\\\to Y induced by a homotopy from g\\\\circ f to a trivial map, which when post-composed with h gives a map :h\\\\circ F\\\\colon CW\\\\to Z. Similarly we get a non-unique map G\\\\colon CX\\\\to Z induced by a homotopy from h\\\\circ g to a trivial map, which when composed with C_f\\\\colon CW\\\\to CX, the cone of the map f, gives another map, : G\\\\circ C_f\\\\colon CW\\\\to Z. By joining together these two cones on W and the maps from them to Z, we get a map : \\\\langle f, g, h\\\\rangle\\\\colon SW\\\\to Z representing an element in the group [SW, Z] of homotopy classes of maps from the suspension SW to Z, called the Toda bracket of f, g, and h. The map \\\\langle f, g, h\\\\rangle is not uniquely defined up to homotopy, because there was some choice in choosing the maps from the cones. Changing these maps changes the Toda bracket by adding elements of h [SW,Y] and [SX,Z]f. There are also higher Toda brackets of several elements, defined when suitable lower Toda brackets vanish. This parallels the theory of Massey products in cohomology.  The Toda bracket for stable homotopy groups of spheres  The direct sum :\\\\pi_{\\\\ast}^S=\\\\bigoplus_{k\\\\ge 0}\\\\pi_k^S of the stable homotopy groups of spheres is a supercommutative graded ring, where multiplication (called composition product) is given by composition of representing maps, and any element of non-zero degree is nilpotent . If f and g and h are elements of \\\\pi_{\\\\ast}^{S} with f \\\\cdot g= 0 and g \\\\cdot h= 0, there is a Toda bracket \\\\langle f, g, h\\\\rangle of these elements. The Toda bracket is not quite an element of a stable homotopy group, because it is only defined up to addition of composition products of certain other elements. Hiroshi Toda used the composition product and Toda brackets to label many of the elements of homotopy groups. showed that every element of the stable homotopy groups of spheres can be expressed using composition products and higher Toda brackets in terms of certain well known elements, called Hopf elements.  The Toda bracket for general triangulated categories  In the case of a general triangulated category the Toda bracket can be defined as follows. Again, suppose that :W\\\\stackrel{f}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } X\\\\stackrel{g}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } Y\\\\stackrel{h}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } Z is a sequence of morphism in a triangulated category such that g\\\\circ f = 0 and h\\\\circ g = 0. Let C_f denote the cone of f so we obtain an exact triangle :W\\\\stackrel{f}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } X\\\\stackrel{i}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } C_f \\\\stackrel{q}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } W[1] The relation g\\\\circ f = 0 implies that g factors (non-uniquely) through C_f as :X\\\\stackrel{i}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } C_f \\\\stackrel{a}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } Y for some a. Then, the relation h\\\\circ a\\\\circ i = h\\\\circ g = 0 implies that h\\\\circ a factors (non-uniquely) through W[1] as :C_f \\\\stackrel{q}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } W[1] \\\\stackrel{b}{\\\\ \\\\to\\\\ } Z for some b.

The church, essentially a chapel for the hall that is reached from the house by a covered walkway, was richly improved within its simple exterior with imported woodwork in 1834: the pulpit and altar, bought from Nuremberg, were optimistically attributed at the time to Albrecht D√ºrer; the carved doors came from Rouen; the presbytery stalls from a disestablished monastery in Ghent,When a party from the Surrey Archaeological Society visited in 1850, \\"Gatton church, as restored by the late Lord Monson, was much admired.

It was broadcast between 12 March and 16 April 1978, as a six-episode series. It was also broadcast in Canada on TVOntario in 1978 and in Germany in 1979 under the title Geheimprojekt Doombolt (\\"Secret Project Doombolt\\").  Plot summary  During a night-time patrol in the Bristol Channel, naval Commander David Wheeler (Donald Burton) receives a message encrypted in Spens Code, a code unknown to the Navy operators. Soon afterwards, Wheeler orders the ship to go about and deliberately rams a small fishing vessel, sinking it completely. He is immediately court-martialled, but he offers no explanations for his actions ‚Äì neither to his defending counsel and friend, Commander Jeffrey Vallance (Frederick Jaeger), nor to his only son, Richard (Andrew Ashby). Richard decides to investigate the matter with his friends Lucy (Shelley Crowhurst) and Pete (Richard Willis), a junior seaman who had witnessed the incident first-hand. Richard happens to know about the Spens Code and its creator: a former Naval Intelligence operative named Hugh Spencer (John Woodnutt), a friend of his father's, who lives in Braxtet. The trio immediately set out in Wheeler's sailing yacht, relentlessly dogged by the Navy watchdogs assigned to watch over Richard. In order to cut time, they sail through the Navy's Forbidden Zone in the Channel, where they encounter a boat with radio- controlled operations and a strange set of aerials mounted on top. Finally arriving at Spencer's house, they find him missing and signs of a struggle. Piecing together the few clues left to them, they stumble upon the word ‚ÄúDoombolt‚Äù and a map overlay of the Bristol Channel area which has several points marked. One of these is a manor named Scudmore, where the youths suspect Spencer has been brought to. Arriving there, they find the place heavily guarded and its occupants marching around in strange silver suits and helmets, which turn out to be protective gear against ultrasonics. They also come to witness a demonstration of a new super weapon, directed by a man called Doctor Franz Bayard (George Coulouris). The Doombolt is a top secret advanced missile guidance system designed by the Royal Navy. It consists of a concentrated radio beam which is meant to guide a missile unerringly to its target; by use of a special, inconspicuous sonar emission vessel, defence missiles buried in the sea bed around the British main isle are fired into the air, where the Doombolt beam takes over. However, the Navy's design was faulty, resulting in the destruction of the transmission beacons and the subsequent self-destruction of the missiles. Bayard, a former Navy scientist, has perfected the system by basing it on a two-beam transmission, collected and amplified at a central control station; but he intends to sell it to a foreign power for his own profit. For a demonstration, he intends to target the Fiddig Brey, a new nuclear-powered supertanker. Commander Wheeler's actions were motivated by the need to prevent Bayard from taking over the Navy's sonar trigger vessel (the sunken vessel), which, however, has already been replaced by the mystery boat in the Forbidden Zone. Only a few officers, including Wheeler and his superior Captain Hatfield (Peter Vaughan), are privy to the project, but there is suspicion of a mole inside the Navy's Doombolt project. Hugh Spencer, who sent the distress message to Wheeler, worked as an undercover spy against Bayard until he was discovered and captured. Richard, Lucy and Pete try to inform Navy HQ in Bristol, where they run into Vallance, who offers to take them to the CEO's cottage in the Brecon Beacons. However, during the ride Vallance lets slip some clues that reveal that he is Bayard's mole in the Navy Doombolt project. Richard and his friends flee immediately, with Vallance and Bayard's men, who are about to set up the first transmission beacon in the area, in pursuit. Distraught at learning that his son has been nearby and is now in danger, Commander Wheeler asks Hatfield for permission to find his son by himself. In the Beacons, Wheeler stumbles upon Bayard's operation and briefly frees Spencer before they are both recaptured, and after a long chase through the area Richard, Lucy and Pete are also caught. As the captives compare notes while the second beacon is transported to its destination (the Mendips, also called \\"Devil‚Äôs Jaws\\"), they learn the transmission angles for the beacons. Also, the youths have left some clues about what they have learned about the Doombolt project, but even with this information the Navy is helpless: since the beacons are small, locating them in these extensive areas proves to be impossible, and Bayard has taken steps to ensure that the Fiddig Brey remains ignorant to the danger. After the second beacon is set, Bayard intends to have his captives brought to his central control as hostages. But as they are to be taken away, Lucy slips out of her bonds and flees. After a long, desperate run, she manages to contact Naval Headquarters and provide Hatfield with the necessary information to track down the Doombolt control centre: Cragfest Island, in the middle of the Channel. A company of Royal Marines is dispatched immediately to take down Bayard's Doombolt. Meanwhile, on Cragfest, Bayard receives his \\"guests\\", gloating about his achievements in working on the Doombolt and about the impending demonstration. The final sequence is initiated when the Marines attack the island. Pete manages to free himself and Commander Wheeler from their bonds, and with only seconds left, they attack Bayard and Vallance. Bayard fires at Wheeler with his pistol, but manages to hit the Doombolt controls instead, critically damaging the system. Just before central control self-destructs, Bayard and Vallance manage to escape in a mini submarine. The series ends with the beginning of a sailing tour on Commander Wheeler's yacht, where Pete's reservations about having a woman on board seem justified when Lucy inadvertently causes him to land in the bay.

Built as a Baltimore Clipper Valparaiso‚Äîa brig built at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1836‚Äîwas one of a class of vessels popularly called \\"Baltimore clippers\\" because of their reputation for speed and outstanding performance. Valparaiso was purchased by the Navy at New Bedford, Massachusetts, on 22 November 1861.

However, instead of deploying with her sisters at the bottom of Charleston harbor as originally planned, Valparaiso joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron of Flag Officer Samuel F. Du Pont and served as a storeship at Port Royal, South Carolina. She remained at Port Royal for the duration of the war. After the collapse of the Confederacy, the old brig was sold at public auction at Bay Point, South Carolina, on 2 September 1865.

Players select one of three different character classes to play as from the choices of \\"Soldier\\", \\"Archer\\", and \\"Sorcerer\\". Players can play alone, or cooperatively with another player locally or over Xbox Live. During play, characters are tasked with saving the land of Arkadia by completing a series of 19 quests, ultimately defeating the evil Gorgon. Quests are received at a town hub where other activities can also be carried out. Most of these quests are relatively straightforward in nature, such as recovering some quantity of a certain item, or defeating certain foes. Within the randomly generated dungeon, players battle large numbers of enemies using abilities specific to their class. Upon gaining a certain amount of experience, characters increase in power and gain additional spells or skills. Additionally, while battling foes, a meter slowly fills which allows players to temporarily morph into a beastly form. These alter egos take the shape of a phoenix, lion or dragon, depending on class. Reception Arkadian Warriors met with an icy reception at IGN, where it earned a grade of \\"Mediocre\\" (5.7/10). The review concludes, \\"We can handle repetitious gameplay in our dungeon crawlers -- it‚Äôs generally mindless fun.

The major alternative workflow used in proteomics is called top-down proteomics where intact proteins are purified prior to digestion and/or fragmentation either within the mass spectrometer or by 2D electrophoresis. Essentially, bottom-up proteomics is a relatively simple and reliable means of determining the protein make-up of a given sample of cells, tissues, etc. In bottom-up proteomics, the crude protein extract is enzymatically digested, followed by one or more dimensions of separation of the peptides by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, a technique known as shotgun proteomics. By comparing the masses of the proteolytic peptides or their tandem mass spectra with those predicted from a sequence database or annotated peptide spectral in a peptide spectral library, peptides can be identified and multiple peptide identifications assembled into a protein identification. Advantages For high throughput bottom-up methods, there is better front-end separation of peptides compared with proteins and higher sensitivity than the (non-gel) top-down methods. Disadvantages There is limited protein sequence coverage by identified peptides, loss of labile PTMs, and ambiguity of the origin for redundant peptide sequences. Recently the combination of bottom-up and top-down proteomics, so called middle-down proteomics, is receiving a lot of attention as this approach not only can be applied to the analysis of large protein fragments but also avoids redundant peptide sequences.

The population is approximately 78. The majority of the population is retirees. South Buxton has only three roads and a single church. It is near the South Buxton raceway. The closest towns are North Buxton and Merlin. History South Buxton was founded in 1849 by the Elgin Association, organized by Rev. William King with support from the Governor General of Canada, Lord Elgin. A neighbouring community with larger population, once the major part of what was called the Elgin Settlement, is North Buxton. Born in Derry, Rev. William King had immigrated to the United States and worked as a tutor and teacher for years in Louisiana, where he married into a planter family and eventually inherited 15 slaves. He had become a Presbyterian minister and was assigned as a missionary to Canada. He was assisted by the Scot, Rev Michael Willis who gave the first communion to the slaves in the church.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/willis_michael_10E.html He gained support from Lord Elgin in order to obtain land for resettlement of his 15 freed slaves. He also wanted to provide for any fugitive slaves, known as Negro refugees, who usually reached Canada by means of the Underground Railroad. In the 1840s and 1850s, they arrived in Canada by the thousands, and settled mostly in Ontario.Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, Refugees from Slavery in Canada West: Report to the Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, (Boston: Wright and Potter, Printers, 1864/reprint Arno Press, 1969), pp. 1-2 Despite early resistance from nearby residents, the Elgin Association purchased 9,000 acres of land, which it divided into 50-acre farms. These were intended to be the basis of subsistence farming. The town grew quickly, with 400 residents after 3 years, and more than 800 residents after 7 years, as African-American refugees continued to reach Canada via the Underground Railroad. The church, St. Andrew's, was built by the community for Rev. William King. A liberty bell, cast in 1800, was used to signal the beginning of church service until the 21st century. Before the American Civil War, the bell was also rung every time a self-liberated slave reached South Buxton. The residents also built Baptist and Methodist churches in North Buxton. Both communities had much higher populations before the urbanization of Ontario drew off rural people into towns and cities for work. Legacy *The Buxton National Historic Site and Museum in North Buxton is dedicated to the African-American refugees and their Black Canadian descendants, who found freedom in Canada via the Underground Railroad.

This site is significant for its archaeological evidence of thousands of years of human habitation during the Archaic period in the Eastern United States. It is located on the northeastern side of County Road 7 (Bluff Road) southeast of Prairie du Rocher in Randolph County, Illinois, United States. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Description The site has over 28 feet of sediment that contain artifacts. Evidence from the site, including four separate periods of Archaic occupation and one of a later period, suggests that the cultures of the Eastern Woodlands may have been comparable in age to the big game hunting cultures of the Great Plains. Based on the analysis of artifacts, archaeologists discovered that 9,000 years ago this rock shelter was used as a short-term camp by small hunting groups; by 6,000 years ago this rock shelter was used for long-term based camps by several families which were involved in activities of everyday life; and, by around 4,000 years ago evidence found in the sediment layers suggests the site was again used by small hunting parties as a short-term camp. There tools included concave projectile points, scrapers, choppers, hammer stones, and bone awls. Evidence has shown that during occupation, the inhabitants had a diet that consisted of deer, raccoon, opossum, birds, and fish. Archaeological history The Modoc Rock Shelter site was discovered in 1951 by amateur archaeologist Irvin Peithmann, who is known for teaching himself about the customs of Native Americans by living among them. Peithmann had observed artifacts on the surface under or near the bluff at the Modoc site following road grading activities that resulted in the removal of sterile fill covering the buried prehistoric materials. He informed Dr. Melvin Fowler, then at the Illinois State Museum, about his discovery resulting in the ISM conducting major excavations at the site in the 1950s and 1980s. Modoc was the first site in Illinois and one of the first in eastern North America at which deeply stratified Archaic deposits had been discovered. If not for Peithmann observing artifacts at this location following the road grading, the location of this deeply stratified site would have remained unknown. Melvin Fowler believed, undoubtedly correctly, that numerous other buried bluff base Archaic sites similar to Modoc existed on the Mississippi River floodplain. Melvin Fowler, personal communication to Mark Wagner, 1980 Peithmann became bitter over the years regarding what he perceived as a lack of recognition by professional archaeologists over his discovery of the site, although Melvin Fowler clearly acknowledged Peithmann and credited him with the discovery of the site in his 1950s publication on Modoc Rock Shelter Irvin Peithmann, personal communication to Mark Wagner, 1980 See also *List of archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois *List of National Historic Landmarks in Illinois *National Register of Historic Places listings in Randolph County, Illinois References Category:Archaic period in North America Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:National Historic Landmarks in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Randolph County, Illinois Category:Geography of Randolph County, Illinois Category:Rock shelters in the United States ","title":"Modoc Rock Shelter"},{"id":"13688049","text":"U.S.S.A. are a rock band formed by bassist Paul Barker and guitarist Duane Denison.

Conceptualised and launched in Melbourne, Australia, in 1993 by McDonald's licensee Ann Brown, and introduced to the public with help from McDonald's CEO Charlie Bell and then-chairman and future CEO James Skinner, the chain reflects a consumer trend towards espresso coffees. Reports indicated that McCaf√© outlets generated 15% more revenue than a regular McDonald's and, by 2003, were the largest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand. After McDonald's Australia experimented with automatic espresso-pronto machines in the last decade and it failed to catch on, all Australian stores were subsequently renovated and converted to McCaf√© outlets. International expansion A cappuccino sold at a McCaf√© in Budapest, Hungary A McCaf√© in San Juan, Metro Manila, Philippines The McCaf√© concept was designed to help create atmosphere and foot-traffic at the entrance to the McDonalds stores at Swanston Street, Melbourne (a very large store with the front counter a considerable distance from the shop's entrance). The idea was developed between Charlie Bell and the local Regional Corporate team (David Bayes, Mike Tregurtha and Jim Vasiliadis). The first McCafe opened as a corporate store in Melbourne, and not by a licensee as indicated above (Ann Brown was Brisbane- based). The first one in the United States opened in Chicago, Illinois, in May 2001 when there were about 300 worldwide. In 2004 McCaf√© opened in Costa Rica and in France, and the next year, the concept was launched in Italy. In June 2006 the first McCaf√© in Bulgaria opened at the Mall of Sofia. In 2007, the chain expanded to Japan as part of McDonald's efforts to boost sales with healthier soup and sandwich offerings and reach out to new customers who favoured traditional coffee shops. Despite being a relatively small part of McDonald's overall strategy, there are 1,300 worldwide. McCaf√© arrived in Paraguay in 2007. In August 2008, McDonald's expanded their McCaf√© concept to South Africa, where the McDonald's franchise is already a household name and one of the largest fast-food chains in the country. At the end of 2009 McCaf√© drinks were available at McDonald's restaurants in the United States. McCaf√© opened in El Salvador on July 6, 2010, located in McDonald's restaurants in the Zona Rosa and Pr√≥ceres Boulevard with the goal of providing the aroma, flavor and texture of 100% Salvadorian gourmet coffee. McCaf√© opened in Madrid, Spain on June 28, 2008, located in McDonald's Montera restaurants. In July 2010 the McCaf√© added real fruit smoothies to their drink list. In November 2010 they added mocha and hot chocolate to their drink list. In July 2011 they added Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and the Mango Pineapple Smoothie to the U.S. menu. In 2011 McDonald's started expansion of McCaf√© in Ukraine. There are six McCaf√©s in Kiev, one in Lviv, one in Odesa, one in Dnipropetrovsk and one in Kharkiv as of January 2014. On November 7, 2011, McDonald's Canada launched McCaf√© across the nation after being available only in select stores prior to this announcement. With the introduction of McCaf√© in Canada, participating McDonald's stores have added mocha, cappuccino, espresso, americano, latte, iced latte, iced mocha and hot chocolate to their menus. With McCaf√©, McDonald's is now in direct competition with Coffee Time, Country Style, Second Cup, Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and Timothy's in the Canadian coffee market. On June 16, 2012, McDonald's launched the first McCaf√© Malaysia in Kota Damansara, with a few others subsequently opening in the Bandar Utama, Subang Jaya, Titiwangsa, and Taman Connaught outlets ‚Äì all located in Klang Valley as well as in Greenlane, Birch House, IJM Promenade and Penang International Airport ‚Äì all in Penang. In Turkey, McCaf√© operates under the name \\"McD Caf√©\\". The first coffee shop opened in July 2012 at Sabiha G√∂k√ßen Airport. As of April 2016, there are eight Mcd Caf√©s on the Asian side of Istanbul, six on the European side, 3 in Antalya, 2 each in Adana and Kocaeli, and one each in Afyonkarahisar, Aksaray, Ankara and Kƒ±r≈üehir. In December 2012, McDonald's announced that it would be bringing the McCaf√© brand and line of products to all of the McDonald's restaurants in the United Kingdom. This would include the addition of iced frapp√©s and iced fruit smoothies, and a rebranding of the standard McDonald's coffee to \\"McCaf√©\\". On October 14, 2013, McDonald's launched the first McCaf√© India in the South Mumbai area in Mumbai, Maharashtra. McDonald's introduced a coffee line called \\"McCaf√©\\" nationwide in the United States. In August 2014, the company announced it was going to start to selling its coffee for home brewing in supermarkets across the United States. Manufactured and distributed in partnership with Kraft Foods, the coffee is available in prepackaged bags and K-Cups. In December 2015, McDonald's Canada opened its first standalone McCafe store in Toronto Union Station's newly built York concourse area. On March 20, 2018, the first McCaf√© in Minsk, Belarus, was opened. Another McCaf√© opened its doors in Minsk on June 24, 2018, and one more was planned to open by the end of 2018.

They are also occasionally used to clear counties from severe weather watches.Special Weather Statement A common form of special weather statement is a significant weather alert. Occasionally special weather statements appear as heat advisories. An EAS activation can and may be requested on very rare occasions. United States: Other Uses Special Weather Statements may also be issued for possible fire weather conditions, such as an enhanced risk. They even can be issued for rain/snow that may hit Advisory criteria such as snow being one inch that isn't going to likely pose a threat. Sometimes Special Weather Statements may be issued to update on current weather conditions, but that is sometimes issued by a Short Term Forecast. =Examples of an American Special Weather Statement= Special Weather Statement National Weather Service New York NY 754 AM EDT Thu May 3 2018 NJZ004-006-103>108-NYZ072>075-176-178-032200- Eastern Passaic-Hudson-Western Bergen-Eastern Bergen- Western Essex-Eastern Essex-Western Union-Eastern Union- New York (Manhattan)-Bronx-Richmond (Staten Island)- Kings (Brooklyn)-Northern Queens-Southern Queens- 754 AM EDT Thu May 3 2018 Relative humidity will fall to 30-35 percent late this morning through this afternoon across much of New York City and Northeast New Jersey.

Thomas Hardy, 1792. John Reeves (20 November 1752 ‚Äì 7 August 1829) was a legal historian, civil servant, British magistrate, conservative activist, and the first Chief Justice of Newfoundland. In 1792 he founded the Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers, for the purpose suppressing the \\"seditious publications\\" authored by British supporters of the French Revolution‚Äîmost famously, Thomas Paine's Rights of Man. Because of his counter-revolutionary actions he was regarded by many of his contemporaries as \\"the saviour of the British state\\";A. V. Beedell, 'John Reeves's Prosecution for a Seditious Libel, 1795-6: A Study in Political Cynicism', The Historical Journal, Vol. 36, No. 4 (Dec. 1993), p. 799. in the years after his death, he was warmly remembered as the saviour of ultra-Toryism. Life Reeves was educated at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford, being elected in 1778 as a Fellow of The Queen's College, Oxford. In 1779 he was called to the bar and held the public offices counsel to the Royal Mint; law clerk to the Board of Trade; and superintendent of Aliens. He also served two terms as Chief Justice of Newfoundland and Labrador (in the summers of 1791 and 1792) until returning to England to accept the post of (Receiver of Public Offices)‚Äîpaymaster to the stipendiary magistrates that had been created under the Middlesex Justices Act of 1792. He was also elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1789 and the next year was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1793 he was appointed as high steward of the Manor and Liberty of Savoy and the King's Printer in 1800. =The Association= Reeves campaigned against Jacobinism by founding at the Crown and Anchor tavern on 20 November 1792 the Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers. According to Boyd Hilton, the Association was \\"staggeringly successful, outstripping even the Constitutional societies\\", with more than 2,000 local branches established before long.Boyd Hilton, A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People? England 1783‚Äì1846 (Clarendon Press, 2006), p. 69. They disrupted radical meetings, attacked printers of Thomas Paine's works, initiated prosecutions for sedition and published loyalist pamphlets.Hilton, pp. 69‚Äì70.Major & Murden. A Georgian Heroine : The Intriguing Life of Rachel Charlotte Williams Biggs The Crown and Anchor association met for the final time on 21 June 1793.Philip Schofield, 'Reeves, John (1752‚Äì1829)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008. Retrieved 26 April 2009. These loyalist associations mostly disappeared within a year \\"after successfully suppressing the organizations of their opponents\\".Robert Eccleshall, English Conservatism since the Restoration (Unwin Hyman, 1990), p. 35. The leading opposition Whig Charles James Fox denounced the Association's publications and claimed that had they been printed earlier in the century they would have been prosecuted as treasonable Jacobite tracts due to their advocacy of the divine right of kings.Eccleshall, p. 36. In a speech on 10 December 1795, Fox described the Association as a system designed to run the country through \\"the infamy of spies and intrigues\\".L. G. Mitchell, Charles James Fox (Penguin, 1997), p. 139. Reeves was upset that he had received \\"not one single mark of civility\\" from William Pitt the Younger's government for his loyalist activities.J. J. Sack, From Jacobite to Conservative. Reaction and orthodoxy in Britain, c. 1760‚Äì1832 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 104. Thereafter, Reeves held an animosity towards Pitt and was a supporter of the Addington administration in the early 19th century.Sack, p. 104. William Cobbett claimed in 1830 that Reeves had told him that he hated the Pitt administration and its principles and that bitter experience had taught him that one must either kiss or kick the government's arse. =Thoughts on the English government= In 1795 Reeves published anonymously the first of his Thoughts on the English Government, addressed to the quiet good sense of the People of England in a series of Letters. Reeves claimed that \\"I am not a Citizen of the World...I am an Englishman\\".Sack, p. 181. In a controversial passage Reeves likened the monarchy to a tree: > ...the Government of England is a Monarchy; the Monarch is the antient stock > from which have sprung those goodly branches of the Legislature, the Lords > and Commons, that at the same time give ornament to the Tree, and afford > shelter to those who seek protection under it. But these are still only > branches, and derive their origin and their nutriment from their common > parent; they may be lopped off, and the Tree is a Tree still; shorn indeed > of its honours, but not, like them, cast into the fire. The Kingly > Government may go on, in all its functions, without Lords or > Commons...Eccleshall, p. 66. In 1795 a group of Whigs, Fox among them, persuaded the Attorney General to prosecute Reeves for \\"libel on the British Constitution\\" due to his tree metaphor. A parliamentary committee was set up to determine the authorship of the Thoughts. Edmund Burke claimed that the prosecution of Reeves was a pretext for the spread of Foxite views.Eccleshall, p. 40. He considered the tree metaphor \\"slovenly\\" and wrote that he should not have criticised 18th century Whigs. However, he added that Reeves was still a person of \\"considerable Abilities\\" whose argument in the Thoughts, \\"with a commonly fair allowance, is perfectly true\\" and was \\"neither more nor less than the Law of the Land\\". In a letter to William Windham in November 1795, Burke wrote that he considered the Reeves case ironic because Reeves was being criticised by people whose views endangered all three parts of the British constitution: > Heraldry of the constitution! Whether the Lords and Commons or the King > should walk first in the procession! Which is the Root, which the Branches! > In good faith, they cut up the Root and the Branches! A fine Business of Law > Grammar, which is the Substantive, which the adjective. ‚Äì When an author > lays down the whole as to be revered and adhered to, ‚Äì at any former time > would any one have made it a cause of quarrel, that he had given the > priority to any part? especially to that part which was attacked and > exposed? My opinion is, that, if you do not kick this business out with > Scorn, Reeves ought to Petition and to desire to be heard by himself and his > Council.Eccleshall, pp. 40‚Äì1. Reeves was acquitted of libel, although the jury censured him for writing a \\"very improper publication\\".Eccleshall, p. 37. Reeves published anonymously the Second Letter in 1799 and in 1800 the Third and Fourth Letters of his Thoughts. In 1801 Reeves published Considerations on the coronation oath where he supported the King's opinion that the coronation oath prohibited Roman Catholics from Parliament. He also supported his dismissal of the Pitt government. Reeves further claimed that presbyterianism rather than popery was the greatest threat to Church and state.Sack, p. 227.

Born William Hill, he was the second son of Noel Hill, who was created first Baron Berwick in 1784, and his wife, Anna, a maternal granddaughter of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford. He was educated at Rugby School and Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating M.A. in 1793. From 1796‚Äì1812, he was Tory Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury and for Marlborough from 1814‚Äì18. He held command, as major, of the Shrewsbury Yeomanry Cavalry from its inception in 1798 until 1804, when the command was handed to Charles Dallas, and of the Shropshire Militia as lieutenant-colonel from 1801 to 1814, although diplomatic duty abroad took him away from duty in this country. History of Parliament article. Hill went to France as attach√© to the British charg√© d'affaires in Paris in November 1801, and was on duty during the truce brought about by the Peace of Amiens. When war with Napoleon resumed he was briefly in captivity but escaped to England. In 1805, Hill was appointed ambassador to Ratisbon (though the Napoleonic Wars prevented him from taking up office), to the Kingdom of Sardinia, whose court was exiled by the war in Cagliari in 1807 and at Turin in 1814 following Napoleon's defeat, and to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at Naples in 1824. That same year he and his younger brother assumed the additional surname of Noel, from his grandfather, and was created a Privy Councillor.Cokayne et al., The Complete Peerage, volume II, p. 167. In 1822, he had rejected George Canning's offer of the post of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In 1832, he inherited the barony of Berwick from his childless older brother, Thomas.

The music is inspired by the stories of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and is a tribute to the Cthulhu Mythos.  Theme  Orchestra, string instruments, drums, pipes, guitars and choirs are accented by ominous chanting, strange sound effects and brief narratives that combine to tell the story of an alchemist who dares to raise an ancient race of otherworldly beings. The \\"language of the Old Ones\\" developed by Lovecraft as a literary plot element but considered by many to be unpronouncable, is effectively spoken aloud by Joseph Vargo on several of the tracks. Vargo, who is a huge fan of Lovecraft's work, also illustrated the CD packaging to appear as he imagined the famed fictional book to be from Lovecraft's descriptions. A hidden track on the CD also contains the phrase \\"Klaatu barada nikto\\", a well-known quote from the film The Day the Earth Stood Still and Army of Darkness, which in turn borrowed thematic elements from Lovecraft. Some of the songs titles are also titles of Lovecraft stories, such as \\"The Nameless City\\" and \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\", while others song titles such as Azathoth, Dagon, Nyarlathotep, Cthulhu and the Great Old Ones are the names of gods, demons or other supernatural entities from Lovecraft's fiction. A chapter in the book, The Strange Sound of Cthulhu: Music Inspired by the Writings of H. P. Lovecraft was devoted to this album. Nox Arcana's Necronomicon along with their later tribute to the Cthulhu mythos Blackthorn Asylum received mention in Gordon Kerr's book Cthulhu: Dark Fantasy, Horror & Supernatural Movies.

Playing career Nelson Ancheta began his career playing at Universidad Cat√≥lica de El Salvador during his youth. Afterwards he joined Once Lobos where he would play eleven years in two different spells (playing in between the Primera Divisi√≥n and Segunda Divisi√≥n). He would go on to play for Universidad Centroamericana Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as and Hurac√°n; the latter would be where he would finish his playing career in 1997. Coaching career =Fuerte Fronterizo= Ancheta's coaching career began in 1987, debuting with Fuerte Fronterizo in the Segunda Divisi√≥n. However, he had to wait until 1994 to coach a first team squad, this time with Juventud Candelare√±a in the Tercera Divisi√≥n. =Once Lobos= This was followed with coaching the club he had played in previously, Once Lobos, both the reserves and then later the main team (playing in the Segunda Divisi√≥n at the time). =Isidro Men√©ndez= In 1999, he coached Isidro Men√©ndez, now known as Isidro Metap√°n. In 2000, he became the assistant coach of Agust√≠n Castillo in FAS main team, and the coach of FAS reserve team. During these periods, FAS won five championships and Ancheta managed to coach FAS in 11 games. =Atl√©tico Balboa= Afterward, he coached Atl√©tico Balboa in 2006. =Once Municipal= Ancheta was offered the coaching job for Once Municipal, which led to his most successful tenure in his coaching career, winning his first and so far only domestic title with them (winning the Apertura 2006 title after defeating his old club FAS 3‚Äì1), while also winning the Copa Presidente 2006‚Äì2007 against √Åguila (1‚Äì0 victory). =Return to FAS= However, the difference with the club's president meant that he left his coaching position. He then returned to FAS to take over as head coach of the team. He took the club to two consecutive finals (Apertura 2007 and Clausura 2008); however, he lost on both occasions. =Nejapa FC= He left the club after a disagreement with the board of the club and joined low table team Nejapa FC in 2009. With smart recruitment and clever tactics he took Nejapa FC to their first and only semi-finals in the Clausura 2009. However, the club was destroyed 6‚Äì1 on aggregate by Isidro Metap√°n and he left the club following this loss. He coached various clubs in the next couple of years, including Once Municipal, Alianza, √Åguila and Luis √Ångel Firpo, with varying degrees of success. =Cicl√≥n del Golfo= He then joined the newly formed club Cicl√≥n del Golfo in 2012 and helped them win the Apertura 2012 de la Segunda Divisi√≥n after a 2‚Äì1 aggregate victory over Tur√≠n FESA. =Drag√≥n= He then took over the reins of Drag√≥n and led them to the club's first final (Clausura 2014) in Clausura/Apertura format and almost helped Drag√≥n win their first title in 70 years. However, the club lost against Isidro Metap√°n on penalties in that final. A pay dispute with the Drag√≥n board of directors meant that he left the club, in May 2014. Ancheta was replaced by Roberto Gamarra. =Return to Luis √Ångel Firpo= Ancheta joined Luis √Ångel Firpo in 2014 in the quest to regain promotion back into the Primera Divisi√≥n. However, in their first campaign, despite going 16 games undefeated in the regular season, they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Marte Soyapango. =Deportivo Malacateco= Ancheta had his first coaching job abroad by coaching Deportivo Malacateco in Guatemala, however his time there was a poor one in the fourteen games he coached the team won two games, drew four and lost eleven. On 5 November 2015, he resigned as coach of Deportivo Malacateco. =Chalatenango= After passing through Guatemala, he joined Chalatenango. But surprisingly Ancheta resigned due to the dispute of two directives to gain control of the team. =Independiente FC= In 2016 Ancheta joined Independiente FC of the Segunda Divisi√≥n. =Return to Drag√≥n= In September 2016, he returned to Drag√≥n, at a time when the team was going through an administrative, economic and sports crisis. Ancheta left the club in February 2017 due to poor results in the matches and was replaced by V√≠ctor Coreas. =Chag√ºite= In 2018, he signed with Chag√ºite. =Jocoro= However, months later he would return to the Primera Divisi√≥n with Jocoro, newly promoted team. With the team of Moraz√°n Ancheta brings regular results, making Jocoro the revelation team of the Apertura 2018 tournament. =Sonsonate= On 11 December 2018, Ancheta signed as new coach of Sonsonate for the Clausura 2019, replacing Hugo Ovelar.

By the end of the 19th century, Egyptian, Lebanese and Syrian newspapers and magazines increased the publication of short stories and sections of original or translated novels, influenced by the Western world and the view of the human struggle in the world that was illustrated in literary works such as that of Franz Kafka. During that time, Arab writers referred to this type of creative writing as Riwaya, Qissah, or Hikayah to denote more specific types of what is known and accepted today as the short story. Egyptian authors such as Muhammad Husayn Haykal, Mahmoud Taymour, Tawfiq al-Hakim, Yusuf Idris and others influenced the first modern Syrian Arabic short story. Today, many Syrian authors such as Zakaria Tamer, Faris Farzur, Ghada al-Samman, and many others are considered to be some of the most distinguished authors who contributed much to the development of this genre. The Arabic short story can be classified in three different periods. The first is ‚ÄúThe Embryonic Stage,‚Äù (Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜŸäŸÜŸäŸëÿ©) dated from the beginning of the 19th century to 1914; the works of writers of this stage such as Salim Al-Bustani, Labibah Hashim, Khalil Gibran, Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti and others were described as melancholic, and they had adapted Western short story techniques. The second stage, known as ‚ÄúThe Trial Stage,‚Äù (Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ¨ÿ±Ÿäÿ®ŸäŸëÿ©)dated from 1914 to 1925, may be called the traditional stage, in which we find clear attempts for authentic voices. Writers of this new genre, such Muhammad Taymour, Tahir Lashin and others, felt it necessary of studying its techniques in Western literature and approach it in a more unconventional way. And finally, ‚ÄúThe Formative Stage,‚Äù (Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ¥ŸÉŸäŸÑŸäŸëÿ©) which extends from 1925 to the present, was opened by Mahmoud Taymour, where a new narrative style emerged emphasizing the development and psychological analysis of the characters in the stories with a more realistic approach. In the 1960s, the short story achieved a distinguished level of grounding in specific artistic characteristics, including an insistence on being short in length, encompassing a short time frame, having critical and deep details, written in prose language, having a minimal number of characters, and conveying an ambiguous ending which leaves the reader to his own imagination and interpretation.

Once the first ballot, or vote, has occurred, if no candidate has a majority of the delegates' votes, the convention is then considered brokered. The nomination is then decided through a process of alternating political horse trading, delegate vote trading and additional revotes. In thay circumstance, all regular delegates, who may have been pledged to a particular candidate according to rules, which vary from state to state, are \\"released\\" and may switch their allegiance to a different candidate before the next round of balloting. It is hoped that the extra privilege extended to the delegates will result in a revote that yields a clear majority of delegates for one candidate. The term \\"brokered\\" implies a strong role for political bosses, which used to be more common and is associated with deals made in proverbial \\"smoke-filled rooms.\\" The term \\"contested\\" is a more modern term for a convention in which no candidate holds a majority, but the role of party leaders is weaker in determining the eventual outcome. For the Democratic Party, unpledged delegate votes, also called \\"superdelegate votes\\", used to be counted on the first ballot. The term \\"brokered convention\\" has referred to a convention whose outcome is decided by superdelegate votes, rather than pledged delegates alone, but that is not the original sense of the term and has not been a commonly-used definition for a \\"contested convention.\\" As of 2018, Democratic superdelegates will participate only if no winner emerges after the first round of balloting. Specific party rules =Democratic Party= Under the Democratic National Convention rules, \\"A majority vote of the Convention's delegates shall be required to nominate the presidential candidate\\" and \\"Balloting will continue until a nominee is selected.\\" Superdelegates are party leaders who participate as delegates if no winner emerges after the first round. Prior to 2018, they were allowed to participate in the first round as well. =Republican Party= The rules are subject to change every election cycle and are determined by the Republican National Convention prior to the convention date. An example of this is Rule 40b of the RNC which was in effect in 2012, but was not adopted for the 2016 convention in Cleveland. Under this rule, a candidate must have the support of a majority of the delegates of at least eight states in order to get the nomination. Rule 40e then states that if no candidate has received the majority of votes, \\"the chairman of the convention shall direct the roll of the states be called again and shall repeat the calling of the roll until a candidate shall have received a majority of the votes.\\" In history Before the era of presidential primary elections, political party conventions were routinely brokered. The Democratic Party required two thirds of delegates to choose a candidate at the first Democratic National Convention in 1832 and at all conventions from 1844 to 1936. That made it far more likely to have a brokered convention, particularly when two strong factions existed. The most infamous example was at the 1924 Democratic National Convention in which the divisions between the wets and dries on ending Prohibition and various other issues led to 102 ballots of deadlock between the frontrunners Alfred E. Smith and William G. McAdoo over 16 days before the dark horse candidate John W. Davis was chosen as a compromise on the 103rd ballot. Adlai Stevenson II (of the 1952 Democratic Party) and Dwight D. Eisenhower (of the 1952 Republican Party) are the most recent presidential nominees of their respective parties who won their nominations at brokered conventions. While Eisenhower had 595 delegates out of 1,206 in the first roll call, delegates changed their votes before the official vote could be declared. Conventions close to being brokered Since 1952, there have been several years when brokered conventions were projected but did not come to pass: * The 1968 Democratic National Convention might have been brokered if New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy had not been assassinated. He had won four of the primaries, including California, but too few delegates were then selected by primaries to determine the presidential nominee. US President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had decided against running for a second full term, still controlled most of the party machinery and used it in support of US Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who did not contest the primaries personally although two surrogates won their home states. If Kennedy had lived, the convention likely would have been divided between his and Humphrey's supporters. * The 1968 Republican National Convention featured former Vice President Richard Nixon as the clear delegate leader, but figures such as New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller tried to prevent Nixon from gaining a majority. During the early days of the convention, Rockefeller supporters claimed that there was \\"erosion\\" among Nixon delegates. If there was any, it was minor, and Nixon was nominated on the first ballot. * In the 1972 Democratic National Convention the delegate leader, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, was not assured of victory until a procedural move to reject some of his California delegates was averted on the first day of the convention. * In 1976, the Republican primaries gave President Gerald Ford a slight lead both in the popular vote and in delegates before the Republican National Convention, but he did not have enough delegates to secure the nomination. A brokered convention was predicted, but Ford managed to receive the necessary support on the first ballot to edge Ronald Reagan, a former governor of California. This is the most recent Republican presidential convention to have opened without the nominee having been decided in the primaries. * In 1980, Senator Ted Kennedy, challenging incumbent President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination, fell short in the primaries, but Kennedy was still urging delegates to switch over to him when he arrived at the Democratic convention in August. However, Carter won handily on the first ballot, and Kennedy dropped out of the running a few hours later. * In 1984, as a result of the Democratic primaries, former Vice President Walter Mondale was the clear frontrunner but remained 40 delegates short of securing the nomination. His nomination had to be formalized at the convention, which was the last time that any presidential convention opened without the nominee having been decided in the primaries. However, a convention fight was unlikely, as rival Gary Hart was lobbying for the vice-presidential nomination and was resigned to the likely possibility that Mondale would be nominated for president. Mondale indeed received the overwhelming support of superdelegates on the first ballot and became the Democratic presidential candidate. Races with failed predictions of being contested * In 1988, a brokered convention was predicted for the Democrats. There was no clear frontrunner since Gary Hart had withdrawn. Also, Paul Simon, Richard Gephardt, Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson had each won primaries. Dukakis was named the frontrunner by the media, as he drew support from all sections of the nation, and other candidates' support was largely limited to their native regions. He maintained the momentum and secured the nomination in the next round of primaries. * For the 2008 election, there had been speculation that the Democratic Party's national convention might be brokered, or at least that the convention might commence without a presumptive nominee. For the Democrats, a brokered convention was considered possible, as it was unclear for a time whether either of the top two candidates, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, would be able to win a majority of pledged delegates before the convention. The only other candidate to win delegates was Senator John Edwards, who withdrew after the first month of the contests. Although Edwards won fewer than 0.5% of the delegates, the race between Obama and Clinton was narrow. If neither candidate had a majority of delegates by the time the primaries finished on June 3, the candidates might have had to seek support from the undecided remainder of the superdelegates to secure a majority at the convention. Nancy Pelosi, the chair of the Democratic National Convention, had argued that the superdelegates should not overrule the results of the primaries. In the last week of the primaries, Howard Dean, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, called for the undecided remainder of the superdelegates to commit to either remaining presidential candidate. His intention was to ensure that the nomination would be decided once the last primaries concluded on June 3. In the end, a brokered convention did not occur since by June 3, Obama had enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates to secure a majority at the convention. *There was also speculation that the 2008 Republican primaries would result in a brokered convention because of the number of strong candidates and their different geographic bases. The large number of \\"winner-take-all\\" states benefited candidates with strong regional support. In addition, the weakened power of President George W. Bush to force candidates out of the race resulted in fewer levels of influence for them. At one point, it was thought likely that five different candidates would win five early contests (Mike Huckabee in Iowa, John McCain in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney in Nevada, Fred Thompson in South Carolina, and Rudy Giuliani in Florida). However, McCain won South Carolina and Florida in addition to New Hampshire and would remain dominant for the rest of the primary season and so a contested convention did not come close to happening. *In the 2016 Republican primaries, there was considerable speculation, from the party's opponents to the presidential candidate Donald Trump that a contested convention might take place. On March 16, 2016, Former Speaker of the House John Boehner said that in the case of a brokered convention, he would support the current Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, for the nomination although Ryan was not a presidential candidate. Boehner's remarks sparked controversy by implying that the Republican Party did not have to select a candidate participating in the primary election process. Trump's significant victory in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016 caused his final two opponents, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, to suspend their campaigns shortly afterward, and Trump, the only candidate who still had an active campaign, handily won all the remaining contests by reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the nomination by May 26.Trump reaches delegate number to clinch GOP nomination. Fox News. May 26, 2016. Reasons for rarity Several factors encourage a clear and timely decision in the primary process. Firstly, candidates tend to get momentum as they go through the process because of the bandwagon effect. Thus, one or two candidates will be portrayed by the media to voters as the frontrunners as a result of their placement in the first primaries and caucuses, and as also-ran candidates drop out, their supporters will tend to vote for one of the frontrunners. Theorists have identified two types of political momentum, piecemeal and all-at-once, with different impacts on front-runners and those right behind them. Secondly, political parties wish to avoid the negative publicity from a brokered convention and to maximize the amount of time that the nominee has to campaign for the presidency. Especially because of the desire to foster party unity in the months leading up to Election Day, it is considered possible, if not probable, for any \\"brokering\\" that may be required for a future presidential convention to take place in the weeks and months before the convention, once it becomes clear that no candidate will likely secure a majority of delegates without an agreement with one or more rivals. Such an agreement would likely commit the frontrunner to make some form of concession(s) in return, such as selecting the former rival as his/her vice presidential nominee. That was the case prior to the 1980 Republican National Convention. Former California Governor Ronald Reagan won the presidential nomination and chose George H. W. Bush as his vice- presidential nominee although President Gerald Ford was the frontrunner for the slot. In popular culture In the U.S. edition of House of Cards, two episodes of the fourth season center on an open convention run by the DNC. Incumbent Frank Underwood is easily nominated for the presidency, but the vice-presidential nomination is contested between Secretary of State Catherine Durant and First Lady Claire Underwood. The last two episodes of season six of the US series The West Wing centers on the Democratic Party's nomination process while three candidates vie for the nomination: Vice President Bob Russell, Representative Matt Santos, and former Vice President John Hoynes. A fourth, Governor Eric Baker, attempts to get nominated from the floor after the first ballot fails to produce a nominee. Santos ultimately wins. In the final season of satirical comedy series Veep, Selina Meyer gets caught in a brokered convention. She manages to win the nomination but only after a series of compromising decisions, including pledges to ban same-sex marriage and to open up federal land to oil drilling, which encourages Tom James' campaign manager to expose his sexual exploitation of her to derail his attempt to win the nomination and nominating the populist nativist Jonah Ryan as her running mate.

A slice of ham or bacon is sometimes added. It is also known colloquially in the United States as chicken parm and in Australia as a parma, parmi, or parmy. The dish originated from 20th-century Italian diaspora. It has been speculated that the dish is based on a combination of the Italian melanzane alla Parmigiana, a dish using breaded eggplant slices instead of chicken, with a cotoletta, a breaded veal cutlet generally served without sauce or cheese in Italy.

Home versions also grew in popularity. A recipe was published in the 1953 issue of the New York Herald Tribune that used frozen fried chicken patties or fillets along with other pre-processed foods to make a version of the dish at home.

In the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana is often served as a main course, and sometimes with a side of, or on top of pasta. Many restaurants also offer chicken parm sandwiches. Upon arriving in America, Italian immigrants began to take advantage of America's affordable meat market, incorporating chicken into parmigiana. =Australia= Chicken parmigiana with chips and salad, a common serving in Australia Chicken parmigiana was known in Australia by the 1950s. It was offered in restaurants in Adelaide as early as 1953. It is regularly served as a main meal throughout Australia, where it is considered a staple of pub food. In a 2019 interview that was broadcast on ABC Radio Hobart, food historian Jan O'Connell believes that chicken parmigiana did not become a pub staple until the 1980s; before that time it was primarily served in restaurants. Chicken parmigiana is typically served in Australia with a side of chips and salad, although there is some dispute as to whether they should be served under or next to the chicken. Its popularity has led to a specialized chicken parmigiana restaurant opening in Melbourne, and chicken parmigiana is the subject of reviews on dedicated websites which compare the dish as purchased from various pubs within a region. The dish's colloquial name varies across regions, with 'parmy', 'parmi' and 'parma' the most popular variations.Joshua Dabelstein (2018) \\"The Great Australian Debate: Is It Chicken Parmi, Parmy or Parma?\\" New Matilda, February 8, 2018.

Beef is used most often but it can be made with chicken and pork as well. A similar dish using veal is known in Italian as cotoletta alla Bolognese, which excludes tomato sauce but includes melted parmesan cheese and prosciutto.

The village is located along Saskatchewan Highway 763.  History  Zelma incorporated as a village on August 10, 1910. The Zelma Church was building in 1909 with a load of $500 for lumber and volunteer labour; initially as a Presbyterian Church, it was reorganised in 1917 as the Zelma United Church. Until 1912, students were required to attend school in the neighboring communities of Stonemount or Golden Wheat due to reluctance of many of the farmers (who were bachelors) in the area to vote in favor of spending tax money on a school; in 1912 the school district was established, originally using the church for classes until a one-room school house was constructed in 1925. The school closed in 1969, with students bussed to Young. During the early years following the establishment of Zelma, the village had a thriving business community with a general store, lumber yards, a hotel, bakery, flour mill and grain elevators; most of these business had disappeared by the end of the 1940s.
