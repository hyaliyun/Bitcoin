The style went through several changes during pre-statehood, mostly during the developments of Mexican folk and cowboy Western music. After statehood, New Mexico music continued to grow in popularity with native New Mexicans, mostly with the Pueblo, Navajo, Apache, Neomexicanos, and the descendants of the American frontier. Shortly after statehood, during the early 1900s, elements of Country music and American folk music began to become incorporated into the genre. The 1950s and 1960s brought the influences of Blues, Jazz, Rockabilly, and Rock and roll into New Mexico music; and, during the 1970s, the genre entered popular music in the state, with artists like Al Hurricane and Freddie Brown receiving airtime locally on KANW, and international recognition on the syndicated Val De La O Show. Other artists prominently featured on the Val de la O Show were other Southwestern artists, performing Regional Mexican, Tejano, Texas country, and Western music, which brought a more general audience to New Mexico music. The sound of New Mexico music is distinguished by its steady rhythm, usually provided by drums or guitar, while accompanied by instruments common in Pueblo music, Western, Norte√±o, Apache music, Country, Mariachi, and Navajo music. Country and western music lend their drum and/or guitar style sections, while the steadiness of the rhythm owes its origins to the music of the Apache, Navajo, and Pueblo. And the differing rates of that tempo comes from the three common Ranchera rhythm speeds, the polka at 2/4 (ranchera polkeada), the waltz at 3/4 (ranchera valseada), and/or the bolero at 4/4 (bolero ranchero). The language of the vocals in New Mexico music is usually Mexican Spanish and New Mexican Spanish; American and New Mexican English; Spanglish; Tiwa; Hopi; Zuni; Navajo; and/or Southern Athabaskan languages. Nationally and internationally, New Mexico music is classified under several different genres, including World, Country, Latin, Folk, and Regional Mexican. Origins The musical history of New Mexico goes back to pre-colonial times, but the sounds that define New Mexico music begin particularly with the ancient Anasazi. Some of their music is thought to have survived in the traditional songs of the Pueblo people with wind instruments such as the Anasazi flute, as well as the chants and drum beats of the Navajo and Apache. When the Spanish founded Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, they brought with them liturgical music, the violin, and the Spanish guitar, and Mexico brought with it the traditions of Mariachi, and Ranchera. After New Mexico became a territory, the people of the American frontier brought the traditions of Country and Cajun music. This was when the first forms of New Mexico music began to be played. Western was an adaption of Country and Cajun, accompanied by traditionally Mexican and Native American instruments. Once New Mexico became a state, the music was sung at parties and in homes as traditional folk music. During the 1950s and 1960s, it became a form of popular music. In the 1970s, KANW began playing Spanish language New Mexico music.  Songs and albums  Smithsonian Folkways has released traditional New Mexico music on the following albums: Spanish and Mexican Folk Music of New Mexico (1952), Spanish Folk Songs of New Mexico (1957), Music of New Mexico: Native American Traditions (1992), and Music of New Mexico: Hispanic Traditions (1992). These albums feature recordings of songs like \\"Himno del Pueblo de las Monta√±as de la Sangre de Cristo\\" (lit. \\"Hymn of the Pueblo of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains\\") as performed by Cleofis Vigil and \\"Pecos Polka\\" as performed by Gregorio Ruiz and Henry Ortiz, \\"It's Your Fault That You're Looking for Your Horses All Night\\" as performed by The Turtle Mountain Singers, \\"Entriega de Novios\\" as performed by Felix Ortega, \\"Welcome Home\\" by Sharon Burch, as well as other classic New Mexico folk songs. The albums also include takes on other New Mexico folk musics by multiple New Mexico musicians ranging from Al Hurricane, Al Hurricane, Jr., and Sharon Burch. There have been other artists of varying genres that have released albums containing elements of New Mexico music. Country artist Michael Martin Murphey released an album titled Land of Enchantment, tracks such as \\"Land of the Navajo\\" and \\"Land of Enchantment\\" made use of various instruments typically found in New Mexico music. John Donald Robb left a significant collection of 3,000 field recordings of Nuevomexicano and Native music, among others, to the UNM Center for Southwest Research. Songs are available to listen to online.  Radio  * New Mexico Spanish Music is a radio program on Albuquerque-based public radio station KANW which plays traditional and modern Spanish-language New Mexico music. The show was started in 1973. Other relevant shows on KANW include Native Music Hours and Friday's Top 15 at 5:00 Countdown. * KLVO (FM) (\\"Radio Lobo\\") is a Belen-based radio station that broadcasts New Mexico music alongside Regional Mexican music. * KNMM broadcasts mostly New Mexico music throughout the Albuquerque metropolitan area.

History  The Republican Police Corps was established in December 1944 as part of the Italian Armed Forces, within the territory controlled by the Italian Social Republic. The force was established in order to carry out law enforcement and public security duties alongside the National Republican Guard. The new Corps, under Lieutenant-General Renato Ricci, included the Fascist Blackshirts, the Italian Africa Police members serving in Rome and the Carabinieri.https://books.google.ca/books?id=zECXCwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA14&dq;=WWII+Carabinieri++Republican+Police&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjJhJXzntrjAhUSa80KHTgyBy4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q;=WWII%20Carabinieri%20%20Republican%20Police&f;=false, page 14 The Corps would be the entity that would work against anti-Fascist groups and would be autonomous (not reporting to Rodolfo Graziani) according to an order issued by Mussolini on 19 November 1944.https://books.google.ca/books?id=UmxaWvOL_IgC&pg;=PA97&dq;=italy+Republican+Police+++Renato+Ricci&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiqksbGodrjAhXuB50JHb7SDkYQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q;=italy%20Republican%20Police%20%20%20Renato%20Ricci&f;=false, page 97 The Police Corps inherited civilian officials both from the Directorate General of Public Security and from the former Public Security Agents Corps. The organization of the police force in the Fascist-led Republic anticipated that of the Italian State Police established in 1981. The Republican Police Corps was a single government agency, which set it apart from the previous organization (which was upheld in post-war Italy). Previously, the police consisted of civilian police officials and military- organized agents. At the end of the war, the Republican Police Corps was reabsorbed into the Directorate General of Public Security. The police activities were not carried uniformly: there were German (particularly Waffen- SS) interferences and power abuses made by political authorities.  Organization  The Republican Police Corps numbered about 20 000, deployed mostly in provincial capital cities; they were framed into 10 Regional Inspectorates and 66 Questure (provincial-level commands), 2 Speciality schools in Padua, escort teams detached at the Ministries, including the \\"Public Security Presidential Squad\\" (Italian: Squadra Presidenziale di Pubblica Sicurezza) tasked with Benito Mussolini's personal security. There were also operational mobile units, in order to carry out counter-guerrilla warfare and territorial control duties. The counter-guerrilla units, belonging to police forces, were: * 6 military-organized battalions; * Mobile Autonomous Legion \\"Ettore Muti\\", led by Colonel Franco Colombo; * Special Inspectorate Anti-Partisan Police; * Police Arditi Legion \\"Caruso\\". Each Questura had a company-sized public order duty; also the Regional Inspectorates had analogous units. Alongside the regular police forces, did exist some \\"special police units\\", including ill-famed \\"Banda Koch\\" (formally known as \\"Reparto Speciale di Polizia Repubblicana\\" or \\"Republican Police Special Unit\\") active in Rome, \\"Banda Carit√†\\" (also known as \\"Reparto Servizi Speciali\\" or \\"Special Services Unit\\") active in Florence and Padua, and other so-called \\"Repression bands\\".

This steamer should not be confused with a number of other vessels with the same name operating at about the same time in various parts of the United States. Construction William E. Rackleff (or Rackliff) (1834-1909) built Little Annie at or near his residence, the same one he occupied in 1898, at Myrtle Creek, Oregon. Charles Edgar Edwards (b. 1851) worked with W.E. Rackleff to build Little Annie, and in 1878, he was made engineer of the boat. Although the Myrtle, a propeller-driven steamboat from San Francisco, had operated on the Coquille River in 1875 under the command of Capt. John Abbot, it drew too much water and was reported to have been badly managed. Little Annie, launched the next year, was the first steamer to provide successful service in the Coquille River region. Specifications Sternwheel steamers were generally measured over the hull, rather than over the deck, which meant that the extension on the stern to accommodate the stern wheel was not included in the official registered length of the vessel. As measured over the hull, Little Annie measured , a beam of and depth of hold of . The boat‚Äôs overall size was 85.56 gross tons and 72.73 net tons. The official merchant vessel registry number was 140220. In 1878, Little Annie home port (the place where the vessel‚Äôs official documentation was kept) was Empire City, Oregon. Ownership and personnel A large number of steamboat men in the Coos Bay area gained their experience on Little Annie. In 1882, Charles E. Edwards took over command of Little Annie from William E. Rackliff. Subsequent masters included Levi Snyder (b. 1859), Jabez Hall, and George W. Leneve (b. 1851). Little Annie had a number of owners and persons with legal interests in the boat at various times including J.H. Giles, E.G. Flanagan, Olaf Reed, H.W. Dunham, and R.J. Dunham. Operations On December 27, 1879, Little Annie, then owned by Rackliff, had been out of service for ten days for repairs. The steamer reported to be \\"probably again running\\" as of December 27, 1879. On January 3, 1880, Little Annie was reported to be back in service on the boat‚Äôs regular trips. On May 1, 1880, it was reported that Little Annie had \\"resumed her trips on the Coquille river\\" the previous Friday. Capt. Graves took over command of Little Annie in May, 1880, although Rackleff remained the owner. Just after Graves took over, the boat failed, on Friday, May 24, and Wednesday, May 29, 1880, to make its regular trips, with no reason specified in the source. In June 1880, Little Annie was chartered by the U.S. government to transport a party from the Corps of Engineers who were inspecting the Coquille River to evaluate a request from the local citizens to expend $10,000 to improve the navigability of the river. As of December 4, 1880, Little Annie had resumed service on the Coquille River under the command of Capt. C.E. Edwards. Edwards had previously commanded Little Annie. In 1884, two steamers operated on the Coquille River, Little Annie and the propeller-driven Ceres. The total number of people served by the steamers was about 2,000. Little Annie and Ceres made alternate trips between Bandon and Myrtle Point, Oregon, stopping at the many landings along the river. The total length of the trip one way was , and it took a day to make it. The boats would return the next day. On March 6, 1884, Little Annie was reported to be out of service. Little Annie captain, J. Yager, had transferred over to the steamer Ceres, where he took the place of J. Mack as engineer. A teacher's institute was held at the Marshfield Academy in Marshfield (now called Coos Bay) on Wednesday and Thursday, September 24 and 25, 1884. Arrangements were made with Little Annie, the steamers Ceres and Coos, the Isthmus Transit Railroad, and the Coquille and Coos Bay Stage Line to carry teachers to and from the institute at half rates. On March 26, 1885, Levi Snyder became captain of Little Annie. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, Little Annie averaged two trips a week between Bandon and Coquille City, Oregon. Loss At the end of the fiscal year ending on June 30, 1890, Little Annie struck a rock near Bandon and sank. The steamer was a total loss.

Biography Born to a comfortable merchant of wood in the Trentine valleys, he trained with a variety of local masters including Martino Gabrielli, but by the age of 12 years, he was sent to apprentice in Venice. In Venice, he stayed for five years. It is suspected that Valentino had contacts with the studio of Tiepolo. By 1734, he was home in Moena, but returned to Venice from 1743 to circa 1752. The second stay in Venice finds him frequently in the studio of Tiepolo. He married in Venice and three of his four children were born there. His fourth child was baptized on 18 April 1755 in Moena. By 1758 he was residing there. In 1759 he painted frescoes in Cembra, the first for the church of San Rocco no longer exist, but the curiously unthreatening Last Judgement frescoes in the church of San Pietro remain.Cadogan Guides: Venice, Venetia and the Dolomites, by Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls, page 321.Tourism site for Cembra. He painted a series of frescoes (1767) for the parish church of Santa Lucia in Grumes. In Cencenighe, he also painted some frescoes for the church. In 1773, he painted the nave ceiling, depicting the Ascension of Christ; and for the apse, the Fall of Simon Magus and Conversion of St Paul on the road to Damascus. For the sacristy of the church of Santi Pietro e Paolo in Roncegno, he painted an Adoration by the Shepherds and Samaritan at the Well. He painted the main altarpiece of the church of San Vigilio with Saints Vigilio, Massenza, and John Nepomuk. He painted canvases depicting the Martyrdom of Giovanni Bishop of Bergamo (1745) and the Miracle of St Patrick of Ireland (1746) respectively for the Duomo of Bergamo and the church of San Giovanni di Verdara in Padua. He painted a Resurrection of Lazarus in Moeni. He painted a series of frescoes in the nave of the church of Santa Maria Assunta in Cavedine, depicting the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, the Four Evangelists, the Coronation of the Virgin, the Four Fathers of the Church, and the Martyrdom of St Stephen and Lawrence. The sacristy has a fresco of the Sacrifice of Isaac.

Her notable works include The Fourth Watch, Terrace 49, The Red Book, The Secret Story, Colors, Immer Zu, Lost Motion, and Clouded Sulphur.  Biography  Janie Geiser was born in 1957 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She is the second oldest child among six total children. Janie Geiser attended the University of Georgia and graduated with a degree in visual art. While she is known as one of the pioneers of the renaissance of American avant-garde puppetry and object performance, she did not have any defining early experiences with puppetry. Upon completion her BFA degree, Geiser began creating work as a visual artist, exhibiting her drawings and paintings in Atlanta art galleries. By taking a job as the curator of a non- profit, multi-arts organization called Nexus, Geiser began to meet and collaborate with artists from many different fields, including music, dance, theater, and printmaking. After her time at Nexus, Geiser took a part-time job in the 1980s as the curator of the Center for Puppetry Arts' puppet exhibits. It was at the Center for Puppetry Arts that she began to investigate both contemporary and historical puppetry, and she encountered a number of contemporary puppetry performers there, including Bruce Schwartz and Paul Zaloom. She created her first puppetry performance, Little Eddie, in the Center's basement, and developed several works there under the name Jottay Theater, with puppeteers and musicians from Atlanta. In 1986, Geiser moved to New York City where she founded \\"Janie Geiser and Co.\\", a collection of New York actors and puppeteers. She created a number of key works there, including Stories from Here (1986), developed with the Jottay Theater, including writer Neill Bogan and composer Chip Epsten. They were awarded an Obie for their production of Stories from Here at Dance Theater Workshop. Other shows included When the Wind Blows (1992), Evidence of Floods (1994-1996), Night Behind the Windows (1998) and more. She collaborated as a designer with other theater artists, including The Talking Band (The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol, 1988), Dick Connette (Half a World Away, 1989), and Mac Wellman and Travis Preston (Infrared, 1990). In 1990, Geiser also released the first of her three short puppet films, Royal Terror Theater. In the year 2000 Geiser received the Creative Capital Performing Arts Award. Starting in 1992, Geiser began making short experimental films, a practice that continues through this day. Her performances often combine film and live performance. Her films have been screened at major museums including MOMA, the Whitney Museum, LACMA, SFMOMA, and others. Her films have screened at festivals including The New York Film Festival, London International Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and others. Around 2008 during the creation of her film, Ghost Algebra, Geiser experienced a strange health problem. She has a feeling of ‚Äúelectricity in her nerves‚Äù. Geiser visited all kinds of doctors, had an MRI, went to a neurologist, and what seemed to help the most was a combination of acupuncture and herbs. The cause of her health issue was never determined and symptoms still surfaces occasionally. This health issue served as an inspiration for her film, Ghost Algebra. She is married to collage filmmaker Lewis Klahr.  Major Works / Oeuvres  = The Red Book (1994) = The Red Book is a collagic animated film in which Geiser describes The Red Book as ‚Äúan elliptical, pictographic animated film that uses flat, painted figures and collage elements in both two- and three-dimensional settings to explore the realms of memory, language and identity from the point of view of a woman amnesiac.‚Äù In 2009, it was selected to the United States National Film Registry. = Immer Zu (1997) = An elliptical, experimental film that evokes a mysterious undercover world of secret messages, cryptic language, and indecipherable codes. Shot in luminous black and white, Immer Zu uses miniature two and three dimensional figures and sets, as well as shadow puppetry, to suggest the urgency of a nocturnal mission, a mission of life and death importance. In this dark and richly atmospheric film, with a soundtrack collaged from several film noirs, meaning is constantly covered and uncovered in a shadowed journey toward eclipse. Mark McElhatten writes in the program for the 1998 New York Film Festival: ‚ÄúThe dark-meshed moires of the memory book in its pulp fiction edition forms obsidian riddles that cut time to ribbons. Life puts us in the critical condition of having to espionage with our own stolen recollection of events preserving them in a code often difficult to retrieve as it sinks into the limited access of the mental underworld.‚Äù And in Film Threat (1998): ‚ÄúAlong with Kerry Laitala‚Äôs beautiful \\"Retrospectroscope\\" (already well-reviewed in a previous Film Threat), Janie Geiser‚Äôs 9-minute short is one of the few shorts at this year‚Äôs festival, experimental or otherwise, which deserves more attention than it‚Äôs getting. Geiser has made an extremely cryptic piece of highly original cut-out animation with a mystery and menace that recall David Lynch‚Äôs early shorts.‚Äù = The Fourth Watch (2000) = Like many of Geiser's films, the film was produced inside the filmmaker's own home. Geiser filmed the dollhouse in broad daylight giving the film a more natural light, but the shading from the leaves outside her window casts equivocal and dark shadows into the rooms. This film is composed of superimposed black and white film images from silent horror movies, which lay inside the interior of a 1940s tin dollhouse. The dollhouse was only a thrift store find but reminded the filmmaker of her own home. By shooting the dollhouse and rephotography sequences in-camera, an illusion of time is created by multiple characters crossing through the same space or gestures crossing through multiple rooms. Since Geiser used minimal markers when it came to making the video, much was left to be exposed to the elements. For example, some of the image flows over the border as if they were being produced by a projector on an unfitting screen. This condemns the film a non- traditional frame-by-frame shot, with figures illuminating towards off-screen spaces. The figures are fixated in one spot and are seemly haunted with carrying out their repeated actions. =Ultima Thule (2002)= Ultima Thule is a film that attempts to create a map of the terrain outside the borders of the known world, and the title is taken from the medieval name for this place. Geiser combines stop-motion animation, using objects such as dolls, toys, paper, and other found objects, along with re-photographed footage to tell the story of the survivors of a plane crash after it was swept into the sea during a storm. A young, mysterious girl becomes their guide to lead them to the next world. The mystery of the unknown is a major theme in the film, and the survivors are shown in a state of limbo, an ambiguous space between life and death. Footage used in the film is taken from Disney‚Äôs Dumbo (1941) and Peter Pan (1953), along with clips from the Godzilla movie Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964), all of which contain the narrative of wayward children and separation from their parents‚Äô world. The way in which Geiser rephotographed the clips make them almost unrecognizable, and she does not cite the source material at any point during the film for both legal and aesthetic reasons. =Terrace 49 (2004)= The title of this piece was taken from the name of street in Los Angeles, suggesting to Geiser that it belongs to one of many terraces. The footage was derived from the 1960s cartoon series Fantastic Four, and was clipped during the moments of imminent doom--a telephone dangling from its hook, a truck approaching the cliffside, ropes quivering from unseen tension. Invisible Woman is the heroine of the series, yet her face is never exposed. Instead, she is seen when her body visibly turns ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù. Through different moments of Terrace 49, the filmmaker unveils the three modes of invisibility that describe Invisible Woman through the cartoon series. There are times that she is fully invisible, seen solely in the effects of the physical objects she touches; other moments when she is identified by a transparent outline of a figure; and lastly, when she is fully presented as a white and solid torso without any noticeable features. Halfway through the film, the ropes break and as one waits for the destruction, the truck is pulled into reverse and the disaster is inverted. Geiser is playing with the moment of suspense, when imagined death has arrived. She toggles the moment in between life and death, the space between the two realms. =The Spider‚Äôs Wheels (2006)= Geiser was inspired by the heroines in early film serials, known as the ‚Äúserial queens,‚Äù along with the display of heightened feminine power in film throughout history and how they are reflected in political and cultural movements. The Spider‚Äôs Wheels is a cinematic diorama- installation combining projection, sculpture, and film. The piece is centered on the star of a fictitious serial about a female detective known as ‚ÄúThe Spider.‚Äù Found footage of a contemporary actress playing a silent film star heroine is projected throughout the different areas of the installation. The projection areas include sculptural areas such as a Plexiglas box with metal flaps that serves as a silver screen, a wire mesh screen resembling a web that rises and falls in a three-minute cycle while the footage is projected onto it, and a staircase that leads to a door where the viewer must look through a peephole in order to view the scene. Automata Automata is a non-profit organization founded by Janie Geiser and Susan Simpson, located at 504 Chung King Court in the Chinatown District of Los Angeles. This organization is a center for ‚Äúexperimental puppet theater, experimental film, and other contemporary art practices centered on ideas of artifice and performing objects.‚Äù Automata invites playwrights and composers, puppeteers and designers, visual artists, and new media experimenters to collaborate and create new works using performing objects. The Automata has a specific interest in creating intimate shows for their viewers, emphasizing in personal interactions with the crowd and allowing for dialogue and communication between the performers and the audience. Geiser has teamed up with Erik Ehn, Trudi Cohen, Alma Sheppard-Matsuo, Severin Behnen, Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew, John Eckert and others to produce award-winning and highly acclaimed small puppet theater programs. Archive Geiser's film collection is held by the Academy Film Archive. The archive preserved her film The Secret Story in 2017.

Although persons of these categories were not permitted to serve in the Soviet Army, members of the labor columns were considered to be conscripted for military duty. Soviet Germans A notable category of \\"labor armyists\\" (Russian: \\"—Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞—Ä–º–µ–π—Ü—ã\\", German: Trudarmisten) were Soviet Germans. This started in 1941, when the NKVD (via Prikaz 35105) banned ethnic Germans from the Soviet military. Tens of thousands of these soldiers were sent to the Labor Army.Ethnic cleansing in the USSR, 1937‚Äì1949, J. Otto Pohl, Greenwood Publishing Group, via google books on 2010-10-12 During 1942, eventually all male Germans of ages from 16 to 50 years and all female Germans of ages 16‚Äì45 without children younger than 3 years were conscripted to labor duty. Most of them worked at \\"NKVD objects\\" (i.e., basically in the same conditions as in Gulag prison camps; the Germans were supposed to be housed in separate camps, but this was not always done), and in coal mining and petroleum industries, railroad construction, ammunition, general construction, and other industries. Many lost their lives in the labor army. Basically the German labor columns were dismissed in 1945, but Germans were held for much longer. In 1948 they were transferred to the status of \\"special settlers\\" and were not allowed to return home. In 1955, after the official visit of Chancellor of Germany Adenauer to the Soviet Union and the signing of a number of Soviet-German agreements, this status was abolished (the process of resettlement of Germans to Germany was started at this time as well). Still, the Germans that were deported initially from European and border regions (in particular, Volga Germans) were not allowed to return.

Kennedy (August 18, 1835 ‚Äì January 18, 1904) was a miner, restaurant and hotel proprietor, and the 8th mayor of Missoula, Montana. Early life Kennedy was on August 18, 1835 in Ohio to James and Catherine Kennedy. He was raised on a farm and worked in Ohio hotels until 1855 when he enlisted in the 10th U.S. Infantry for five years. He spent the next five years prospecting in northern California, Idaho, and Alberta before taking up ranching in Helena, Montana. Kennedy and his family remained on the Prickly Pear ranch until 1869, during which time he and his family survived being surprised and captured by sixteen Indians near the top of the Dearborn River. Supposedly, the Indians held a vote on whether the group should be massacred or not. When the vote ended in a tie, the Indians asked the \\"half-breed\\" accompanying Kennedy to break the tie. Naturally, he voted to spare the group and the family was spared. After sending his family back east and following the gold rush for a couple more years, Kennedy eventually settled in Missoula, Montana. Hotel and restaurant proprietor After reuniting with his family, Kennedy moved to Missoula where he engaged hotel and restaurant business in addition to maintaining a ranch outside the city. In 1871, he opened the \\"Kennedy House\\" on Main Street. It was put up for sale in 1877, and in 1881 he sold this property to Capt. W.H. Rodgers of Virginia City, Montana, who would rename it the \\"Rodgers Hotel\\". Kennedy himself planned to retire to a ranch. However, in November that same year, Kennedy purchased a lot from Christopher P. Higgins to build a two-story and basement building for a restaurant and public hall. \\"The Missoula Restaurant\\" opened the next year as the first restaurant on Main Street. It was managed by Kennedy and Hentz. In October 1884, Kennedy took charge of the Windsor Hotel on Front Street. The next year, he took control of the Missoula Skating Rink. In May 1890, in partnership with Samuel Mitchell, the foundation walls for the New Kennedy Hotel (Missoula Hotel) were laid and the three-story Tudor-style was completed early 1891. The hotel soon began to have financial problems. Mayor Kennedy was elected as the 8th mayor May 5, 1890 and served for 12 months.

In 1956 he formed the first organised neurosurgery unit in the country. The unit was located in the General Hospital Colombo (present National Hospital of Sri Lanka). It is said that this unit was an up-to-date unit at the time. It even had the facility to perform skull base surgery, which was a novelty at that time. Most of the \\"first neurosurgery operation in the country\\" were performed here.  Associations  Fifty years later in 2006, Neurosurgeons Association of Sri Lanka was formed under the leadership of Jaliya Lokuketagoda. Other leading neurosurgeons who contributed to this task were Deepal Attanayake, Fred Perera, S.C.Abeysuriya, Prasanna Gunasena, Ranjith Wickramasinghe, Saman Wadanamby, Jayantha Liyanage, Himashi Kularatne, Arul Kanagarajan, T. Rajakaruna, Nishantha Gunasekara and Sunil Perera . S C Abeysooriya was elected the first president.(www.nsasl.lk)  Technological contributions  First ever operative neurosurgery contribution from Sri Lanka to the world surfaced in 2012. It was a combination of open craniotomy and stereotaxy which is used to treat intraventricular hemorrhage and the technique was designed by Jaliya Lokuketagoda.  Neurosurgeon training and certification Sri Lanka has just over 20 consultant neurosurgeons for over 20 million people. The country produces its own neurosurgeons through a seven-year rigorous training process. The training includes a mandatory training segment that has to be completed in Sri Lanka and another mandatory training segment which has to be completed in a reputed neurosurgery center in England or in Australasia. This way Sri Lanka manages to offer a high level of care to its neurosurgery patients. The Postgraduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) of University of Colombo is the responsible body for training and certifying neurosurgeons.(http://pgim.cmb.ac.lk/) The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) maintains a list of Consultant Specialists of the country including neurosurgeons.(http://www.srilankamedicalcouncil.org/) If a non-Sri Lankan neurosurgeon wishes to practice in the country a temporary medical licence should be obtained from the SLMC.  Patient care  The Sri Lankan population is served by two systems. In the private healthcare system, the patient has to pay, and in the public healthcare system, healthcare is free. Both systems offer reasonably good neurosurgery service to the population. However, most modern neurosurgery facilities are only available in major cities like Colombo. The government neurosurgical centers are situated in Colombo, Sri Jayawardenepura, Kandy, Karapititya (Galle), Jaffna, Batticalo and Badulla. The Colombo center, which is affiliated to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka is the best equipped and well staffed unit. All the private neurosurgical units are located in Colombo. They are affiliated to the private hospitals; Nawaloka hospital, Asiri Group (Central hospital) and Lanka hospital. Central hospital has the leading neurosurgery division in the private sector. All these units have well equipped intensive care units for post-operative care. Although medical tourism is not a major industry in Sri Lanka, there are quite a number of foreigners who have sought neurosurgery care in these private hospitals during emergency situations. The private neurosurgery units accept most international and local health insurances.

History  Usually, at the end of 19th century in Canada, the arrival of the train and the construction of forest roads in the hinterland allowed better access to wilderness. In the 20th century, airplanes, snowmobiles and other all-terrain vehicles were other ways to remote and difficult to reach water bodies. Consequently, forestry and mining, hunting, fishing, and other recreational and tourism activities (excursions, boating, vacationing...) were able to grow in these wilds. In 1978, the Quebec government has chosen not to renew the leases of private clubs hunting and fishing on public lands. \\"Zec du Bas- Saint-Laurent\\" was established in 1978 by the Government of Quebec to democratize access to this territory and to help the development of outdoor recreation. This newly created zone was assigned to volunteer directors elected by the members of Zec, who will see their administration and control the exploitation of fish and wildlife.  Geography  The territory of the ZEC covers an area of in the administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent. It is located along the R√©serve faunique de Rimouski (Rimouski Wildlife Reserve).

Overview Singapore's Smart Nation initiative was launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 24 November 2014. In financial year 2017, the government set aside $2.4 billion to support the initiative, which involves the government purchasing services from technology startups rather than offering grants to support them. To support development, open data is made available at government portals such as Data.gov.sg. Some areas of focus include enhancing public transport networks, enabling successful aging and ensuring a secure but open data marketplace. The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) tracks and analyses data related to housing, amenities and public infrastructure. Former civil servant Peter Ong explained that this ‚Äúencompasses hardware like lamp-posts and public cameras, as well as software that enables sensor data exchange and data and video analytics‚Äù. An interconnected network of 110,000 lamp posts with wireless sensors will collate data that will be used for urban and operational planning, maintenance and incident response. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGO) and Government Technology Agency (GovTech) under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) lead the development of a National Digital Identity framework for online transactions between citizens and businesses, building on the current SingPass system. Recognition Singapore emerged top in the 2017 Global Smart City Performance Index by Juniper Research and Intel. The ranking is based on the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and connected services, and which the nation came out tops in all four of the key areas measured - mobility, healthcare, public safety and productivity.  Ministerial committee  The initiative is coordinated by the SNDGO and supported by other government agencies. GovTech is also placed under the PMO as the implementing agency of SNDGO. Collectively, the SNDGO and GovTech form the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG). The SNDGG is overseen by a Ministerial Committee chaired by Senior Minister (SM) Teo Chee Hean. The other members of the Ministerial Committee are Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative; Minister Chan Chun Sing; Minister S. Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information; and Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary, who is the Minister-in-charge of GovTech and who will also coordinate GovTech's strategy with Info-communications Media Development Authority's (IMDA) industry development efforts. Smart Nation Initiative As part of the Smart Nation initiative, the Government of Singapore has been introducing cashless payments on a large scale. Various efforts have been made to incorporate the use of cashless payment into citizens' lives. =Land Transport Authority Initiative = In March 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) began an account-based ticketing pilot that allowed Mastercard users to use their debit and credit cards to pay for public transportation. In August, the LTA and TransitLink announced plans to have a fully cashless public transport system by 2020. Beginning in September 2017, cash top up services were removed from MRT stations, and they were fully phased out by March 2018. In April 2019, commuters could begin using Mastercard contactless bank cards to pay for their fares and this payment method was extended to Visa cardholders in May. =Cashless system at hawker centres = During the National Day Rally speech in 2017, plans for a unified cashless payment system in Singapore were unveiled, especially in regard to payments at hawker centres. DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank, which jointly own the existing electronic transaction system NETS, had collaborated with other banks such as HSBC, Maybank, Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank to unify the cashless system in Singapore. Consumer from all seven banks will be able to use Nets' QR code system to make payments at hawker stalls. More than 600 stalls had implemented the system in 2017. As a subsidiary of Land Transport Authority, contactless transport payment card operator EZ-Link has also partnered up with NETS to introduce e-payment methods in local hawker centres. Starting from April 2018, payment at hawker centres can be carried out using EZ-Link or Nets card using a single Nets terminal. There were mixed responses from the food vendors. Several stall owners expressed their opinions on the efficiency of the system, stating that sometimes the cashless electronic transactions do not go through, causing delays in the queue of the business. Others mentioned that the new system can prevent hygiene issues, which might occur when cash is involved. Surveillance concerns and issues With the gradual implementation of the Smart Nation initiatives, there are new concerns raised by security experts that the ubiquitous surveillance, with the proposed \\"Lamppost-as-a-Platform\\" (LaaP) with extensive facial recognition technology, could undermine individual privacy. There were also concerns that the expectation of mass surveillance by the government could also result in \\"self- surveillance, self-monitoring, self-censorship\\", and a general aversion to \\"improvise, innovate and take risks\\". The government responded by stating that the Public Sector (Governance) Act passed in January 2018 clarifies when data sharing is allowed across government agencies, as well as which agency is responsible for the request and sharing of data. Public servants' data access rights is given based on security clearance and authorisation. The Act also criminalises the sharing of personal data without authorisation and the using of data for self-benefit or for the re-identification of anonymised data without authorisation. The government also stated that it has no plans to use the surveillance methods for the purposes of social credit scoring or moral policing. Cybersecurity The failure of the government in securing data in recent years, such as in the SingHealth data breach in July 2018, is causing critics to push for a rethink of the Smart Nation drive.

Cott (born November 8, 1945) is an American historian and professor who has taught at Yale and Harvard universities, specializing in gender topics in the US in the 19th and 20th centuries. She has testified on same-sex marriage in several US states. Early years Nancy F. Cott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on November 8, 1945. Her father was a textile manufacturer and her family origins are Austro-Hungarian Jewish. She attended public schools in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania. She studied at Cornell University, obtaining a bachelor's degree in 1967, then went on to Brandeis University where she obtained an master's degree in American civilization in 1969. She married Leland D. Cott in 1969. They have two children, born in 1974 and 1979. She obtained her doctorates in American civilization from Brandeis in 1974. Career Cott became a lecturer at Boston Public Library, then in 1975 was appointed to teach history and American studies at Yale University. Cott was assistant professor 1975‚Äì79, associate professor 1979‚Äì86 and professor 1986‚Äì90. She obtained research fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation and Guggenheim Foundation and from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Cott was one of the founders of the Women's Studies program at Yale. She chaired the American Studies Program at Yale in the mid-1990s, and then directed the Division of the Humanities. In 1990 she was appointed Stanley Woodward Professor of History and American Studies. Cott was named Sterling Professor of History and American Studies in 2001 at Yale University. At the invitation of Drew Gilpin Faust of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study she accepted a position as Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director of the Schlesinger Library in 2001. She had a long association with the library, having used it to research her first book, Root of Bitterness: Documents of the Social History of American Women (1972). Cott was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008. She left the Schlesinger Library in June 2014. As of 2014 Cott was Jonathan Trumbull Professor of American History at Harvard University. She was teaching undergraduate courses on the history of sexuality and gender, and graduate- level courses on the history of the US in the 20th century. In 2014 she was also president-elect of the Organization of American Historians. Same-sex marriage Cott has helped write Amicus curiae briefs on same-sex marriage in several states since 1999. These have included challenges to the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Cott testified as an expert witness in the case of Perry v. Schwarzenegger in California. Cott has pointed out that the Christian tradition of monogamous marriage only dates back to the time of Christ, and was not strongly enforced by Catholic ecclesiastical law until 1400 or 1500. Protestants, including the founders of the US, have historically seen marriage as a civil concern, mainly concerning child support. Views on marriage continue to change, with higher divorce rates, different views on the role of marriage and the legalization of interracial marriage. Cott says she has come to favor same-sex marriages, \\"as a result of my historical research and study.\\" In her view, \\"if gender symmetry and equality and the couples' own definition of spousal roles are characteristic of marriage, then same-sex couples seem perfectly able to fulfill those roles.\\" When testifying in January 2010 in the challenge to California Proposition 8 (2008), which banned same sex marriage, she was asked to comment on the defense assertion that \\"the purpose of the institution of marriage, the central purpose, is to promote procreation and to channel naturally procreative sexual activity between men and women into stable and enduring unions.\\" She responded that, \\"It rather reminded me of the story about the seven blind men and the elephant, in that each of them is feeling the animal at some side of it; and the one that feels the trunk says, oh, this animal is just like a snake.\\" Publications Publications include:      *  References  = Citations = = Sources =    Category:1945 births Category:20th-century American historians Category:21st-century American historians Category:American women historians Category:Brandeis University alumni Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Historians from Pennsylvania Category:Living people Category:Yale University faculty ","title":"Nancy F.

The municipality of Argao was established as a parish in 1703 under the Augustinian order. To serve the parochial needs of its people, a stone church was constructed in 1734 and was completed in 1788. The church was dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel.  Features  The coral stone church is a two- level structure with an imposing, highly ornate pediment and double-pilaster columns on its facade. Together with its convent, the church was fortified to also serve as refuge during Moro raids in the 18th and 19th century. The facade contains articulate carvings depicting the patron saint displayed on its niche, flanked by oversized urn-like finials standing on rectangular bases at each corner of the pediment. The church follows the usual cruciform plan. The interior contains a single aisle with a double nave. Five retablos adorn its sanctuary and transept areas, with the main retablo (retablo mayor) containing 3 life-size statues of the three archangels: St. Michael, St. Raphael and St. Gabriel. The vaulted ceiling is made of wooden panels arranged longitudinally with details of seraphs protruding as corbels. Paintings depicting the life of the angels and archangels, plus several Biblical passages, adorn the ceiling surface‚Äîhalf of which were painted by the renowned master Cebuano painter Raymundo Francia, and the other half by an unknown Boholano artist.

The base of the belfry supports a square plan, while the second and third bases follow an octagonal plan, topped by a domed roof. The bell tower is connected to the church by a single-level baptistry. The convent at the right side of the church served as a seminary during the early part of the 19th century. Today the convent serves as a museum for tourists. At the left of the church structure is the site of the former town cemetery, which now serve as the church complex's gardens. = Baluarte = There are two watchtowers built within the church complex: one at the front of the church and the other at the back. The front watchtower served as the first line of defense during Moro raids, and is integrated within the complex's fortified walls. The one at the back, which is already a ruin, has a circular plan, and was built using river stones and utilizing riprap construction. = Church Plaza = One of the Via Crucis high relieves inside the church plaza The plaza is bound by a short coral stone wall, where processions start and end during religious and festive rites. The plaza contains three statues mounted on pedestals with light posts. The plaza used to have clay tiles on its grounds, plus a big wooden evangelization cross mounted at the center. Adorning the coral stone walls are the 14 high reliefs of the Via Crucis, depicted using symbolisms on each station, which is unique and highly unusual in the country. = Gates and Walls = The gates and walls were built around the time of the construction of the church to provide defense against the Moro invaders. The walls were made thick so that lookouts can walk on top of the walls. The coral stone barriers were carved with floral reliefs on certain sections. The entranceway has rectangular overhead beams that span the width of the passageway, wide enough to allow sentries to walk across. Each of the gateway columns feature stairs for access to another part of the wall. The four gateways are located on each of the four sides of the perimeter of the fortification. = Site of the Former Palacio = This L-shaped building was called by the townsfolk as the Palacio, where Spanish dignitaries and priests from the city stay during their visits. During the American era, the building was used as an elementary school. The building was burned by the Japanese during the Second World War. Today, the Palacio is now being used as a hospital. = Mortuary Chapel = Beside the front entrance of the fortified church complex is a single level, coral-stone structure built together with the church. It was used as a leprosarium during the Spanish period and as an autopsy area for those who died tragically during the American era. The facade's pediment features very ornate carvings of angels and human figures, with skull and bone details that explain the function of the structure.

He offered a very different view of the origin of continental landscaping than that of William Morris Davis. Studying at university in New Zealand King was a disciple of Charles Cotton who was heavily influenced by Davis. While King's ideas were an attempt at refuting Davis' cycle of erosion they were themselves of cyclical nature and contributed to what Cliff Ollier has called \\"Davis bashing\\" ‚Äî the ridicule of cyclical theories in geomorphology, in particular Davis' ones. Critics did however not propose alternative models. For him, the weathering of physical factors in arid areas causes the erosion of the hills, the deposition of the weathered material (pediments) and the deposition of these material in lower altitudes, contributing to the formation of the pediplain. He was also an early proponent of continental drift, having lectured on this matter at a number of U.S. universities during a tour in 1958. King was a supporter of the Expanding Earth hypothesis.

His career has included touring 2013-2016 as lead guitarist and often playing keyboards and banjo for the classic rock group America.\\"45 years on and America, the band that dominated the 70s, have never sounded better\\". May 14, 2015, JANET FIFE-YEOMANS, The Daily Telegraph.\\"America delivers national anthems in Covey concert\\". November 10, 2014 Doug Fox Daily Herald. Early life and education Worrell was born in Pasadena, California. He attended Moorpark High School, Glendale Community College, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Classical Guitar Performance from California State University, Northridge in 2008. In the fall of 2016, he began his MBA in Music Business, a joint program between Southern New Hampshire University and Berklee College of Music. His father is guitarist/mixing engineer Jeff Worrell. Career Worrell joined the group ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù in 2009, as guitar tech, originally subbing for the existing tech, Pete Leonardo, for 4 months. However, Pete was unable to return, eventually leading Bill to retain the position full-time. He continued as guitar tech until 2011, during which time, he was asked to sub occasionally for lead guitarist Michael Woods. In 2011, he left the group to pursue his own music, but returned again in late 2013 to replace retiring Woods. Affectionately introduced as ‚ÄúBilly the Kid,\\" Worrell continued touring with the band until 2016, when he launched into a solo career. Bill's music is heavily guitar-oriented. While many songs include lyrics and have a radio-friendly appeal to them, several are instrumental in nature. His first EP, ‚ÄúBill Worrell‚Äù is entirely instrumental recalling luminaries such as Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and John Petrucci. Worrell released his solo \\"Nashville Sessions\\" EP, produced by Fred Mollin and featuring original songs Worrell co-wrote with Molly Rocklind, in August 2016. This album featured session musicians Shannon Forrest on drums, Pat Coil on keys, Kerry Marx on rhythm guitars, and Larry Paxton on bass. Fred Mollin played additional keys and percussion instruments. In early 2017, Bill released a collection of instrumentals recorded over the years, called ‚ÄúTime to Change‚Äù. This marked a return to instrumental guitar compositions, although tracks such as ‚ÄúTime to Change‚Äù, ‚ÄúJaded‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDone‚Äù include vocals. In April 2018, he released the single ‚ÄúCrashing Down‚Äù. Later that year, he released ‚ÄúI Wanna Fly [Single]‚Äù ‚Äì a track from his ‚ÄúThe Nashville Sessions EP‚Äù re-recorded with new players, a new key, and a slightly different arrangement.\\"Broadway World: Bill Worrell Announces New Solo EP 'Nashville Sessions'; Out Now\\" References Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:American rock guitarists Category:Lead guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Berklee College of Music alumni Category:Southern New Hampshire University alumni Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:21st- century American male musicians ","title":"Bill Worrell (musician)"},{"id":"43719134","text":"The Central California Conference is a high school sports league in Central California.

The name is derived from the Japanese verb tsumu meaning \\"to stack\\", because the rectangle-shaped toys are designed to stack on top of each other, forming a pyramid shape. There are also vinyl versions of them manufactured by Jakks Pacific. The toys were first released in Japan in 2013 as a tie-in to the Tsum Tsum arcade and mobile games respectively developed by Konami and Line Corporation. Disney began selling them in the United States in July 2014, and in Disneyland Paris the following month. Around the same time, Disney released Tsum Tsum to the South Korean market, giving away icons for use on online chat systems. As of 2014, 1.8 million Tsum Tsum toys have been sold. As of April 2017, the franchise has reached $2 billion in sales between both merchandise and the mobile game. Disney Tsum Tsum Festival, a party game based on the toyline developed by B.B. Studio and Hyde and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, was released for Nintendo Switch in 2019.  Design  Tsum Tsum toys are typically made of felt, microbeads, and stuffing, although hard plastic models can also be found. They are ovular in shape, and vary in sizes. Initially, the toys were released in three different sizes: \\"mini\\" ( long), \\"medium\\" (), and \\"large\\" (). In June 2014, a new \\"mega\\" size () was released to the Japanese market. In October 2015, Disney announced a subscription-only \\"small\\" size (). In November 2015, during the Japanese D23 Expo, a new \\"micro\\" size () was introduced.  Characters  Disney offers dozens of characters in the Tsum Tsum line. The line includes classic mainline characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Chip 'n' Dale, Pluto and Goofy, as well as secondary Disney characters like Bambi, Pinocchio, Lady, Tramp, Tinker Bell, Cinderella, and others. Contemporary characters are also represented, including those from Lilo & Stitch, Winnie the Pooh, Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., Big Hero 6, The Aristocats, Phineas and Ferb, Star Wars, and Cars. Disney has also released alternate character representations for holidays and special events. On 1 August 2019, the original members of the English rock band Queen‚ÄîFreddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon‚Äîwere added to the Japanese version of the mobile game as Tsum Tsums, with the first three added as playable characters. Selecting any of playable members in the game will have an instrumental version of their respectively written signature songs playing in the background; Mercury features \\"We Are the Champions\\", May features \\"We Will Rock You\\", and Taylor features \\"Radio Ga Ga\\". The band appears in the game as representatives for the 2018 20th Century Fox film Bohemian Rhapsody. The Tsums are exclusive to the Japanese version only. There is also a CGI animated short series featuring the characters.  Mobile games  = Disney Tsum Tsum = Disney Tsum Tsum (promoted as LINE: Disney Tsum Tsum) is a free-to-play mobile puzzle game for iOS and Android developed and published by Line Corporation. The game focuses on Disney, Pixar, and Star Wars characters rendered as Tsum Tsum toys. The game is divided between two different versions which differ in content; the original Japanese version, and a separate global version. Both versions are regularly updated separately from one another. The game requires a constant Internet connection to play. As of April 2017, the game has surpassed 70million downloads and grossed over in lifetime revenue. As of February 4, 2019, the game reached in lifetime revenue, of which 96% came from Japan.  Gameplay  The game's story is that Disney Tsum Tsum toys have fallen from the shelves of the Disney Store overnight and need to be put back on the shelves before the store opens. Players must drag their finger on their phone's touchscreen to connect at least three Tsums in order to clear them from the playfield, clearing as many Tsums as possible before time runs out. As Tsums are cleared, players score points, and more of the toys fall in from above. Players score more points (as well as coins to buy new Tsums and raise their score level caps) when clearing four or more tsums at a time. Clearing at least seven Tsums (six when a specific boost is activated before a game) will also spawn a magical bubble (known as a bomb in the Japanese version) that immediately clears surrounding Tsums when tapped to pop them. As Tsums are cleared, they fill up a \\"Fever Meter\\" that, when full, triggers a ten-second \\"Fever Mode\\", which adds five seconds of playtime to the timer, clears away Tsums faster, and temporarily prevent combos from breaking. In addition, clearing \\"MyTsums\\" (a Tsum that players select before each game) fills a meter that allows players to use their MyTsum's special ability. There are two types of Tsums: Happiness Box Tsums and Premium Box Tsums. Happiness Boxes, which cost 10,000 coins each, contain one of fourteen Tsums from the Mickey & Friends, Chip 'n' Dale, or Winnie the Pooh franchises. Premium Boxes contain one of an ever-increasing number of Tsums, most of which are earned by spending 30,000 coins each, although some of these Tsums can only be earned via specific methods or events, not through a Premium Box purchase. Premium Box Tsums have stronger skills than the Happiness Box Tsums and usually have a skill level cap of six (Happiness Box Tsums have a skill level cap of just three). Also, for certain periods of time, there may be a second option for purchasing Premium Box Tsums in either Pick-Up Capsules (called Pick-Up Gachas in the Japanese version) or Select Boxes. Pick-Up Capsules contain fifteen or twenty specific Tsums for players to earn, with players being awarded a Skill Ticket‚Äîan item that allows players to increase the skill levels of any Tsum that they already have in their collection for free‚Äîif they empty the dispenser before its availability period ends. Select Boxes contain upwards of ten or twelve Tsums, providing an increased chance of winning Tsums available in such boxes compared to buying them in the regular Premium Boxes. Players also have in-game bingo cards that award prizes when certain optional missions are completed. Completing a row, column or diagonal line of optional missions for bingo will award players various minor prizes, while completing an entire card will earn players tickets for free Tsums (without having to spend coins), special Tsums (including those that cannot be earned through regular means, such as Oswald the Lucky Rabbit or the Alien from Toy Story), or Skill Tickets, depending on the card. Various time-limited events also award similar prizes through completing separate sets of missions. Playing a round of Disney Tsum Tsum costs one \\"heart\\" (life). Hearts can be earned by waiting fifteen minutes to refill (up to five hearts in total; any more than four stockpiled hearts will disable refilling until players have less than five hearts again), completing bingos or event missions, spending \\"Rubies\\" (the game's premium currency that can be purchased through microtransactions or earned through either leveling up or completing bingos), or by sending hearts to Line and Facebook friends who are logged into the game. Players can send one free heart to each friend per hour. Sending hearts do not cost any players their own hearts. Claiming a heart within an hour of being sent will also award players 200 coins. = Marvel Tsum Tsum = Marvel Tsum Tsum was a free-to-play mobile puzzle game for iOS and Android developed by XFLAG and published by mixi. The game focuses on Marvel characters rendered as Tsum Tsum toys. Despite having similar gameplay, the game is unrelated to Line Corporation's Disney Tsum Tsum. The game was released worldwide on August 31, 2016 and was shut down on October 31, 2017.  References   External links  * Website * Jakks Pacific, Inc.

The Irish state has officially recognized Saighir on the List of National Monuments in County Offaly. History According to his hagiographers, Ciaran was born in pagan Ireland and left for Rome to receive Christian baptism and study the Bible. In Rome for twenty or thirty years, he was ordained a bishop and returned to Ireland. On the way, he is said to have met Saint Patrick in Italy and from him received a clapperless bell; whence Patrick told Ciaran to found a church when the bell should miraculously sound, and nearby would be a cold spring. Upon returning to Ireland, he evangelized his paternal kinsmen, the Osraige, and passed through their territory and over the Slieve Bloom Mountains when he heard the tongueless bell sound, and nearby was a spring of cold water. The church grew in importance and as one of Ireland's oldest Christian sites. As the main monastery in Osraige it was the burial ground for the Kings of Osraige of the D√°l Birn. Several times it was sacked by the Vikings, and later it diminished in importance and was superseded by Aghaboe Abbey c.1052. It was refounded as a priory of the Augustinian Canons c.1170, and dissolved in 1568. Not much survives of Saighir today. The remaining ruins include the base of a round tower, the base of a 9th-century high cross, some foundations of the priory, remainings of fortifications, a motte of the Anglo- Norman lords, and a small 19th-century church which was erected close to the site of the former church of the priory. Attached to the site are a holy whitethorn bush on which clothes are hung on 5 March in honor of St. Ciar√°n, and a holy well.

Gormfhlaith, daughter of Flann, son of Conaing, was the mother of this Donnchadh, and his wife was Sadhbh, daughter of Donnchadh, son of Ceallach, king of Osruighe. And according to the book of Ard Macha this Donnchadh, son of Flann, king of Ireland, went with a large party to build a wall or fence round Saighir Chiarain by the direction of his wife, namely, Sadhbh, daughter of Donnchadh, son of Ceallach; for she felt envious at there being a wall or fence round every principal church in Ireland, while her own church, that is Saighir, was without a wall; for the burying place of the kings of Osruighe was at Saighir Chiarain at that time. Accordingly, the men of Meath came to Donnchadh's mound beside Saighir to the west, and they set themselves to build the fence round the church day by day; and at this time the body of Donnchadh, son of Ceallach, king of Osruighe, was brought to Saighir to be buried; and after it was buried, when the darkness of night had set in, nine hairy jet-black crosans came upon the grave and set to choir-chanting as crosans are wont to do ever since, and their eyes and their teeth were whiter than snow, and all their other limbs blacker than blacksmith's coal. They had come, it seems, bringing with them a lay for the king of Osruighe. And all who saw them grew sick a day and a night at the sight. Here is the lay: The people of Donnchadha Mor son of Ceallach, A proud quarterage, Melodious bands who are calling out Are we when on a hosting: Hosts hunting, full plains, Houses for drinking, Fair young women, hospitable princes, Great nobles; The shout of his companies and his troops, The quarterage of a good host; Ranks of skirmishers in the summer sun, Drinking cups, feast-shouts; Harps and pipes in harmony. Fil√©s of Faibhle With a fair new poem they used to come To the gracious king of Raighne; Dod dor dod dan, O son of the king of Raighne, With prosperity, Where are the goblets where the friendship That thy father had? May a pang seized us for the man Whom all amused, Excellent the course on which he was In the fair world; Baptais baptain on his soul Since it is heard, Great his reward after going to the other world, We are his people. Now this band used to keep chanting this lay from nightfall till morning every night over the grave of Donnchadh, so that a doubt arose in the minds of clergy and laity, for they were surprised that demons should be openly attending the body of that most virtuous king. Indeed, among the pious practices of the king were frequent confession and the receiving of the Body of Christ and fervent prayers; and among his exercises of holy zeal was to send food and provisions to be given to God's poor in each principal church in Osruighe on each of the apostles' feasts. Moreover, he used to place an orphan or a poor man to be maintained for God's sake in every household throughout Osruighe, and had besides three purses or three leather bags, to wit, a bag in which each person of the household put a tithe of the food he ate, and a bag in which each put his Michael's portion, and a third bag in which a portion of beeswax was put, which was at the disposal of the housewife to dispense to the poor who had got no share of the tithes or of the Michael's portion. As to the clerics, they fasted and prayed for three days that it might be made known to them why the demons attended the king's body; and an angel of God appeared in a vision to a servant of God of the race of Fiachaidh son of Niall, who was in that assembly. ‚ÄòYe have done well in keeping that fast,‚Äô said the angel, ‚Äònow these are nine of the company of Ui Coingheoidh, and this is the third time they have come to Ireland from hell; and since they could not find an occasion against this king during his life, they are causing a disturbance over his body after his death; and do ye have Mass said and water blessed to-morrow,‚Äô continued the angel, ‚Äòand let it be sprinkled on the grave and throughout all the churchyard, and all the demons will go away.‚Äô This was done and the company of Ui Coingheoidh appeared in the air above, in the form of jet black birds, and they did not venture to light on the churchyard ground because of its having been blessed; and they said that the fasting and the bleesing of the grave by the clergy were necessary, ‚Äòfor we would be after his body on earth since we have not power over his soul in heaven‚Äô. And thereupon they went out of sight of all and they did not see them ever since. It was about this time that the crosan Fionn O Cionga and Mac Rionntach O Connorain lived, and it was they who learned by rote the above-mentioned lay from the company of Ui Coinghaoidh while they were chanting it above the grave of Donnchadh, son of Ceallach, king of Osruighe, and the two referred to practised crosantacht as an art until death.\\"Foras Feasa ar √âirinn le Seathr√∫n C√©itinn, D.D.

Background  During the 1990s, Mitchell was convicted of assault after refusing a gang member entry to a bar he owned. He received a suspended sentence for this and a fine. Mitchell also was convicted for dangerous driving, and was convicted for allowing customers to drink at his pub outside of the licensed hours. For these and other incidents, Mitchell's license to run a bar was suspended in 1998, a hearing he did not attend, though his license was reinstated in 2000. A bar run by Mitchell was investigated in 2008 by gambling authorities regarding possible underage gambling on pokie machines, leading to authorities imposing conditions on the pub's license. Another pub run by Mitchell was shut down for a week following a promotion allowing unlimited drinks for a fixed price. Mitchell has stated that he is \\"proud of my record in the hospitality industry, and the success I achieved in it.\\" Mitchell has been chair of the Waikato-Bay of Plenty Hospitality Association. Political career In 2013, Mitchell was elected to the Tauranga City Council, representing the Mt Maunganui/Papamoa Ward.Clayton Mitchell in running to be NZ First candidate nzherald.co.nz, 14 July 2014 In 2014, Mitchell was elected to parliament after being ranked 6th on the New Zealand First party list at the general election.Newcomers jump up NZ First list odt.co.nz, 27 August 2014 He had also unsuccessfully stood in the Tauranga electorate.List ranking pleases Mitchell nzherald.co.nz, 27 August 2014 In February 2018, Mitchell proposed a member's bill to Parliament to make English an official language of New Zealand. As of May 2020, the bill has not progressed. Mitchell has sat on the select committees for: Business; Economic Development, Science and Innovation: Officers of Parliament; and Standing Orders. He has served as New Zealand First's whip. Mitchell led a 'Respecting New Zealand Values' campaign, seeking to require new immigrants agree to hold certain values. The proposed bill would have required migrants to sign agree to a cultural \\"code of conduct\\" and could expel them from New Zealand if they breached it. In October 2019, Mitchell was involved in an incident at a Tauranga bar, where he and his party were removed from the premises by security. A security guard said that Mitchell was asked repeatedly to move from an area where bar staff needed to pass through, and accidentally hit a member of staff in the head with a glass. Mitchell denied this, saying the accusations were a politically motivated attack and that he was the victim. NZ First leader Winston Peters promised a showing of the bar's security footage, saying that it would exonerate Mitchell. The video was never released; Peters later said he had not seen the video but he had been told of its content by someone he had \\"enormous trust\\" in. In November 2019, Mitchell was reported to be involved in the controversial NZ First Foundation. Between 2017 and 2019, New Zealand First party officials had allegedly channelled half a million dollars of donations into the NZ First Foundation's bank account to cover various party-related expenses such as the party's headquarters, graphic design, an MP's legal advice, and even a $5000 day at the Wellington races. The amount of donations deposited into the foundation and used by the party was at odds with its official annual returns. A party source stated that board members were instructed to pass on large donations to Mitchell who acted as the fundraiser for the party, saying \\"everybody was instructed to find donors and, if they had a big donor, Mitchell would handle them.\\" In June 2020 Mitchell announced that he would stand down at the 2020 election.

(c) Representative SEM image of the free-standing nanobottles after etching in phosphoric acid. Scale bar is 500 nm. and references therein Nanobottles are hollow bottle-shaped particle with the maximal dimension smaller or comparable with 1 micrometer. They can be used for storing and distributing various chemical compounds, for example, inside the human body. Laboratory synthesis Carbon nanotubes capped at one end may be regarded as nanobottles. They can be produced by cutting nanotubes, which are typically capped as both ends after the growth. Nanobottles were also fabricated in a three-step process: First, voids were created in aluminium foils. Then a thin layer of non-Al material, such as carbon, germanium, silicon, silica or hafnia, was deposited into the voids, and the surrounding matrix was etched away. Alumina nanobottles were produced in one step by electrochemical anodization of aluminium foil in phosphoric acid: Pores were etched in Al by the acid, and their inner surface was oxidized in the process. Then the Al matrix, but not the oxidized aluminium, was etched away by the acid. The transition from pore creation to Al etching was achieved by controlling the pulse profile of the anodization voltage. The entire synthesis took about 2 hours. The resulting nanobottles had a volume of ca. 10‚àí7 liters. Hollow silica nanospheres have been produced hydrothermally from a tetraethoxysilane-based gel mixture in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 100 ¬∞C within 3 days. Subsequent calcination at 550 ¬∞C for 5 hours removed the organic components from the spheres and created single holes (mostly) in them, yielding spherical nanobottles. Arrays of gold nanobottles have been fabricated by combining optical interference lithography with thin film deposition. Their dimensions could be tuned by varying the lithography optics and the film thickness. Natural occurrence Carbon nanobottles carrying planetary gases, mostly argon, were found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.Vis, R. D. et al. (2013) Carbon nano-bottles for the planetary gases in carbonaceous chondrites. NNV Najaarsvergadering 2013 Potential applications Nanobottles can be filled with various chemical compounds, which can be used for transporting those compounds in the human body. They can be moved around by magnetic field, after adding a magnetic compound into the bottle content. Encapsulating rare-earth compounds in nanobottles. may result in new phosphors, where the rare-earth ions are separated by the bottle walls, suppressing the concentration quenching of light emission from those ions. Regular two-dimensional arrays of metallic nanobottles may find applications in plasmonic devices, whose resonant frequency depends on the nanobottle geometry.

The purpose was for \\"social intercourse among art lovers, for exhibition and to further art interests.\\" More specifically, it aimed to provide a way in which women's works of art could be marketed that were otherwise limited to women at the time. The group held annual art exhibitions in which members could submit one art work for the exhibition. Any additional works were reviewed by the selection jury. Its members included non-exhibiting and exhibiting members. The Woman's Art Club accepted members and exhibition contributions from women in the United States and abroad. For instance, Mary Cassatt, who lived in Paris, exhibited her works. In 1892 there were about 300 works of art submitted, including watercolors, oils paintings, etchings, pastels and crayons.

The PC Master Race, sometimes referred to by its original phrasing as the Glorious PC Gaming Master Race, is an internet subculture, internet community, and a tongue-in-cheek term of superiority for PC gaming used among gamers to compare PC gaming to console gaming. In current parlance, the term is commonly used by PC enthusiasts both to describe themselves as a group, as well as their belief in the superiority of the PC platform in comparison to consoles, often citing features like more advanced graphics, higher framerates, free online play, wider variety of games, backwards compatibility, modifications, upgradability, customization, lower cost-over- time, open standards, multitasking, and performance. Popular imagery, discussion, and media referencing the term also commonly describes console users who prefer consoles over PCs as \\"console peasants\\" and people who play on PC as the \\"Glorious PC Gaming Master Race\\". History =Creation= In 2008, comedic writer Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw employed the comedically extreme term \\"Glorious PC Gaming Master Race\\" in a Zero Punctuation video-review for the role-playing game The Witcher for the online gaming magazine The Escapist. Croshaw explained that his initial intent in referencing Nazi Germany's master race ideology when he coined the intense term 'Glorious PC Gaming Master Race' was to poke fun at an elitist attitude he perceived among some of the Witcher's PC playerbase at the time of The Witcher's release, who had complained about the PC release of the game being possibly negatively affected by the console port of the game: > \\"It was intended to be ironic, to illustrate what I perceived at the time to > be an elitist attitude among a certain kind of PC gamer. People who invest > in expensive gaming PCs and continually spend money to make sure the tech in > their brightly-lit tower cases is up to date. Who actually prefer games that > are temperamental to get running and that have complicated keyboard > interfaces, just because it discourages new or 'casual' players who will in > some way taint the entire community with their presence. I meant it as a > dig.\\" =Reappropriation= The term caught on quickly, but with a different meaning than originally implied by Ben Croshaw. It is now being used as an expression of pride among PC gamers, who view their PC platform as superior to traditional video game consoles due to its ever-expandable and upgradable hardware, graphical potential, affordability, game library, mod support, freedom of input and peripheral options, emulation capability and other popular reasons. This change in meaning and widespread popularity can be linked back to the creation and popularization of the /r/PCMasterRace subreddit created by Reddit user pedro19 in 2011, which accumulated one million members by July 2017. While The Escapist continued to popularize the term's (or at least the term \\"Glorious PC Gaming Master Race\\") usage in later episodes for several years, writers in more mainstream computer-related and gaming-related publications tended to avoid using the term because of its negative associations, such as Nazism. In early 2015, Tyler Wilde, executive editor of PC Gamer, suggested the term should be abandoned altogether in an article titled \\"Let's stop calling ourselves the PC Master Race\\". \\"It worked as a hyperbolic joke when it was first said as a hyperbolic joke, and I did think it was a little funny to embrace the criticism ironically‚Äîfor a moment, [but] when I see kids unironically boasting about their 'master race' affiliation on forums, I cringe.\\" Tyler instead suggested replacing the term, and offered examples such as \\"Fearsome Keyboard People\\" and \\"PC Thunder Cats\\". The article was met by some disagreement from others who believed the term's usage was acceptable. While Ben Croshaw acknowledged the term's reference to and origins from Nazi Germany, he countered that those who use the term without knowing of the association can be viewed positively as a sign that those ideals and their historic Nazi associations had faded from the public mind. He also made a reference to attempts to incite the term's abandonment as being part of a sort of \\"thought police\\", criticizing Tyler Wilde's article. Croshaw later sardonically admitted his distaste for the term, jokingly suggesting the term \\"PC Gaming Dick-Slurp All Stars\\" instead. =Popularization= The rapid growth of the shortened and now re-appropriated \\"PC Master Race\\" term as well as its handful of associated communities has attracted the attention of related computer hardware and game companies such as Corsair and Valve, as well as celebrities such as Terry Crews. Since 2015, several large technology companies have partnered with the PC Master Race group to organize contests, events and giveaways, such as AMD, Corsair, Cooler Master, Oculus VR, NZXT, and Nvidia. They have also been in close collaboration with the Folding@Home project, a distributed computing project developed by Stanford University, regularly pushing members of the community to donate their computer power to science, and organizing promotion events to fight against cancer and other diseases, as well as hosting an AMA for the Folding@Home team themselves, which had the participation of investigators and students from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford University and Temple University. By several accounts, the term has become an Internet meme, and is a launching point for debates about the relative popularity of gaming platforms. Reviewer Paul Tassi in Forbes suggested that in the platform battle, PCs have an edge because they were a \\"necessity\\" for everyday life while consoles were a \\"luxury\\" costing hundreds of dollars and only offering a few different games or features over that of what a PC already offers.

Rites of Autumn: The Story of College Football. New York: Free Press. p. 119. .http://www.petespoll.com/i-aa/rivalries/ Both schools are members of the Patriot League. Origin of the Cup The Ram‚ÄìCrusader Cup was instituted in 1951 to honor the memory of Major Frank W. Cavanaugh. The idea for the Cup came from William P. Walsh, at the time, a Holy Cross undergrad. Walsh was working at a summer camp headed by then Fordham head coach, Ed Danowski, when hearing that the Rams and Crusaders were restarting their series. Despite being enrolled at Holy Cross, Walsh grew up on Long Island as a Fordham football fan. The summer camp counselor approached his boss and suggested inaugurating a trophy in honor of Major Frank Cavanaugh. The \\"Iron Major‚Äù spent three seasons as head coach of Holy Cross (1903-1905) where he had a 19-10-2 record, and six at Fordham (1927-1932) where he had a 34-14-4 record and also elevated the program to college football's highest level. Danowski, who had captained Cavanaugh‚Äôs very last team while a quarterback for the Rams, looked forward to the trophy game and enthusiastically predicted Fordham would ‚Äúpin back the ears‚Äù of the Crusaders. Instead, it was Holy Cross easily prevailing in a 54-20 blowout. John Cavanaugh, son of the Hall of Fame coach, later made the post-game trophy presentation to Holy Cross. Contests staged in 1952, '53 and '54 were all far closer affairs but each also ended with Holy Cross victories. When Fordham terminated their football program following the 1954 season the Cup was put on hiatus. Return of the Cup Although Holy Cross never terminated their own program, from about the early 1950s to the early 1980s they played a mostly regional schedule at a lower Division I level with only mixed results. In 1982 they moved down to I-AA status where, under Coach Rick E. Carter and later Mark Duffner, fortunes quickly changed. From 1982 to 1991 they finished with a Top-20 national ranking every year but one.https://web.archive.org/web/20160813013302/http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/h/holy_cross/in_the_polls.php Meanwhile, after years without a team, and later, years as a club team, followed by years as a D-III team, Fordham finally elevated their own program to the I-AA level for the 1989 season. The Rams officially joined the Patriot League (then still known as the Colonial League) the following season thus allowing them to resume their series with Holy Cross. 36 years had passed since their last gridiron encounter but once again it was Holy Cross dominating with a 48-0 conquest. The Worcester school kept their monopoly on the \\"Iron Major Cup\\" until Fordham finally broke through with a win in 1995. It started a run where the Rams won 15 of 22. Still, Holy Cross leads the Ram‚ÄìCrusader Cup series, 19-15. They also lead he all-time series 30-25-2 which dates back to 1902, a year before Cavanaugh began patrolling Holy Cross‚Äô sidelines. The 2016 game was played on November 12, at Yankee Stadium, where in front of 21,000+ fans, Fordham routed Holy Cross, 54-14. This marked Fordham's first game at The Stadium since 1946 and the first encounter between the schools at a professional venue since 1954. Previous Cups were staged in Ireland (1991) and Bermuda (1995).

Life Fran Ro≈° was born in Kranj.\\"Ro≈° Fran.\\" 1960. Slovenski biografski leksikon, vol. 9: Raab‚ÄìSchmid. Ljubljana: Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti. In 1902, when he was three years old, his family moved to Celje. He attended the local boys' school, where he was on the honor roll. He then enrolled in the lower secondary school and continued his education at the German-language upper secondary school. After the First World War he joined militants that sought to include parts of Carinthia in the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He then studied law in Zagreb, but was more attracted by teaching schoolchildren. He served as a schoolteacher in Prebold from 1919 to 1925 and then in Celje from 1925 to 1941. During the Second World War he and his family were exiled to Serbia by the German authorities because of his political views. He returned to Celje after four years in exile. He became a school principal during the first academic year after the war, and then taught at a high school and teacher training school. He retired at age 55 and then further developed as a poet. During his retirement he was invited to schools to read his poetry and prose. Ro≈° received a number of Yugoslav awards for his work, including the Order of Labor (Third Class), Order of Service to the Nation with Silver Rays, and Order of Brotherhood and Unity with a Silver Wreath. He was also honored by Celje by being named an honorary citizen of the town. Work Ro≈° started writing poetry while still a schoolchild and published his poems in the student newsletter Savinja. His poetry had an anti- Austrian character, and so during the First World War he was persecuted by the Austrian educational and military authorities. While teaching in Prebold he became familiar with conditions in industrial centers, and he published a number of works in the left-oriented magazines Svoboda and Domaƒçi prijatelj. During his exile in Serbia he wrote Pesmi iz jeƒçe in pregnanstva (Poems of Prison and Exile), which he published soon after returning to Celje. Another noteworthy work was his book Slovenski izseljenci v Srbiji 1941‚Äì1945 (Slovene Emigrants in Serbia 1941‚Äì1945), in which he described the memories and testimonies of those that were exiled. Ro≈° also wrote a considerable body of narrative work expressing goodness, nobility, ethnic consciousness, and connections to justice. Zvesta ƒçeta (The Faithful Company, 1933) is an autobiographical description of his generation. He also published many novellas, sketches, and serial stories in various periodicals based on his memories from his childhood and early years. Some of these also appeared in his book Korporal Hu≈° in druge zgodbe (Corporal Hu≈° and Other Stories). Ro≈° also contributed journalism about Rudolf Maister, Franjo Malgaj, Sreƒçko Puncer, the ≈†lander family, and the 1938 and 1939 Celje culture weeks to Celjski zbornik, and about the rebel Bo≈°tjan Natek and the composer Risto Savin to Savinjski zbornik. Ro≈° wrote most of his children's poetry while his children were young and while engaged with schoolchildren and later his own grandchildren. He published his poetry and sketches for children in the magazines Zvonƒçek, Vrtec, and Na≈° rod during the interwar period, and after the war in the Trieste magazine Galeb and in Kurirƒçek. In addition to the stories that he published in children's magazines, he also published the books Medvedek Rjavƒçek (The Little Brown Bear, 1929, 1931), Juretovo potovanje (George's Trip, 1939), Letalec Nejƒçek (Bart the Pilot, 1972), and Vid Nikdarsit (Vitus Neverfull, 1976). He also wrote two plays for children, which were staged in Celje: U≈°esa carja Kozmijana (Tsar Cosmian's Ears, 1948) and Desetnica Alenƒçica (Magda the Tenth-Born, 1951). For adults, he wrote the comedy Mokrodolci (The People of Mokri Dol), staged in 1946. He also collaborated with the composer Risto Savin, for whom he wrote librettos for the operas Gosposvetski sen (Maria Saal Dream, 1921) and Matija Gubec (1923).

Collaborating since 2004 as Desire Machine Collective, Sonal Jain and Mriganka Madhukaillya employ film, video, sound, space, photography and objects in their installations and works. Their use of experimental techniques and the political character of their narratives have contributed to their growth as one of the leading artist collaboratives in India‚Äôs contemporary art scene. Their works have been showcased at some major international festivals and renowned museums. They were a part of the inaugural Indian Pavilion at the 54th International Art exhibition of the Venice Biennale and nominated for the LUMA award. Their artworks have been exhibited at the Solomon Guggenheim Museum New York and the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin. History Sonal Jain is a fine arts graduate from the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Vadodara, Gujarat, India. She subsequently served as a faculty member in Communication Design at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, India. Mriganka Madhukaillya received a degree in physics from Fergusson College in Pune and completed his postgraduate work in film and video at the National Institute of Design. He currently teaches at IIT Guwahati. Their similar concerns and ideas of the nation, the centre- periphery divide and issues like fascism and globalization, led them to negotiate these complex spaces through art. Influences and Art Assuming their name and theoretical disposition from Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, a seminal text from 1972 by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and psychoanalyst F√©lix Guattari, Desire Machine Collective seeks to disrupt the neurotic symptoms that arise from constricting capitalist structures with healthier, schizophrenic cultural flows of desire and information. Their primary aim is to ‚Äòconfront the many forms of fascism that lead to violence and injustice through their practice, both regionally in Guwahati, Assam, and around the world‚Äô. Desire Machine Collective attempts to move beyond a form that is representative and deal with complexities of image construction which deals with image as perception, time and location. They attempt to free the perception from being bound to a single standpoint and immobile eye, thereby challenging the ‚ÄòRenaissance perspectival stable view of the viewer looking out of the window, which creates an absolute distinction between the grounded viewer and the world in flux out there brought to focus from this point of grounded vision.‚Äô Their earlier works addressed their interest in explorations into image and representations. ‚Äò25/75‚Äô reveals a world governed by numbers. These numbers are arrived at through dreams and the interpretation of dreams according to a system developed in the realm of the oral cultures of a particular community of people. The title alludes to \\"Teer\\" (arrow), a game of betting on numbers, based on the number of arrows that hit a small target. It is a traditional game of archery played in the Khasi Hills, of Meghalaya, Northeast India. Dreams here have a symbolism and bets are made on specific numbers based on the dreams of the previous night. They have a penchant for creating alternate spaces for art, as evidenced by ‚ÄòPeriferry‚Äô, an alternative artist-led residency programme space situated on the MV Chandardinga, a ferry docked in the Brahmaputra River in Guwahati. Periferry serves as a laboratory in flux for generating innovative practices in contemporary film and video. The space and its activities also provide a connective platform for dialogues across artistic, scientific, technological, and ecological modes of production and knowledge. As an extension of Periferry, in 2011, they introduced A+ type, an artist residency programme situated in the city of Guwahati itself. Some of their projects that have widely circulated are ‚ÄòTrespassers will (not) be prosecuted‚Äô (2008), ‚ÄòNishan I ‚Äô (2007) and ‚ÄòResidue‚Äô (2011). ‚ÄòTrespassers will (not) be prosecuted‚Äô is an audio installation consisting of sounds from a ‚Äòsacred forest‚Äô in Meghalaya. This work explores the realm of dematerialisation and transience. False memories (of a forest) are instilled in the audience‚Äôs mind and the work has a life after the installation is over. This soundscape was installed in a public space with subliminal notions of memory, ecology, and geography experienced aurally thereby reclaiming it and rendering it dynamic. It acts as an intangible intervention into time and space. By installing it on the Deutsche Guggenheim‚Äôs fa√ßade, Desire Machine Collective asked whether sound can be regarded as a material thing since, according to local belief, it‚Äôs forbidden to take out any object from Meghalaya‚Äôs sacred forest. The 39 minutes film, ‚ÄòResidue‚Äô, has images of a disused thermal power plant near Guwahati that‚Äôs gradually being swallowed up by the surrounding forest. It highlights their interest in studying the dynamics between machinery, nature and the relationship between images and how they are perceived. It also deals with the cyclical process of creation, destruction and memory and how it is replaced. They first showed ‚ÄòResidue‚Äô in 2010 at the Deutsche Guggenheim and at the Lyon Museum in France, Venice biennale and Paris triennial. ‚ÄòNishan I‚Äô was shot in Srinagar, Kashmir. It is a 4-channel audio-video installation with 4 channels of sound. ‚ÄòNishan I‚Äô registers the interior spaces of abandoned houses that bereft of their primary functions serve as bunkers for the army, with traces of the absences that are repressed within them. The window determines the relation with the world and this relates to the split between the interior and exterior, the ego and the gaze, public and private. Through this work, Desire Machine Collective looks at sensory and perceptual states that result from a disruption of ‚Äòorganic flows‚Äô, the point of departure being a state of sustained conflict and the conditions it produces. It has been exhibited at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Their latest work is titled, ‚ÄòNoise Life‚Äô. More personal than other works by them, the piece points to excessive states of perception occurring in exceptional experiences of blindness or deafness. The work overwhelms the viewer with a chaos of sensations, and attempts to convey how we make complex sense of our lives and express our experiences. Some of their other works are Almost Normal (2005), Alfa Beta (2005), Daily Checkup (2005), About Body Borders (2006), Aliyah (2006), Passage ( 2006), Untitled ( 2007) and 30/12 (2009). Exhibitions Desire Machine Collective had their first solo exhibition Noise Life(2014) at Project88, Mumbai. DMC has presented their work in numerous group exhibitions including Being Singular Plural, Solomon Guggenheim Museum, New York City (2012), Intense Proximity, 3rd edition of the La Triennale, Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2012), Everyone Agrees: It‚Äôs About to Explode, 54th International Art Exhibition of the Venice Biennale, India Pavilion, Venice (2011), Indian Highway IV, MAC Mus√©ed‚ÄôArt Contemporain de Lyon and Indian Highway V, MAXXI Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo, Rome (2011).

Working with film, video, photography and multimedia installation, Desire Machine Collective (Sonal Jain and Mriganka Madhukaillya) explore the relations between power, nature and society. Their recent work focuses on the disruption or interruption of ‚Äòorganic flows‚Äô of goods, ideas and people across interconnected local and global economies, cultures, and environments. This interest is informed by the artists‚Äô position of in-betweenness, both geographically (as they live and work in Guwahati in eastern India) and from a formal and aesthetic perspective. During their residency at Gasworks, they will develop two new projects, ‚ÄòAs1924, 1210.8‚Äô and ‚ÄòTwo Rivers‚Äô. ‚ÄòAs1924, 1210.8‚Äô, which refers to an access number in the British Museum archives, will focus on the life of the self-taught English anthropologist, ethnologist and tribal activist Verrier Elwin. Elwin began his career as a Christian missionary in India in the 1920s, but abandoned the clergy to work with Gandhi and the Indian National Congress, eventually converting to Hinduism in 1935. The second work, ‚ÄòTwo Rivers‚Äô, will look at the shared history of two rivers ‚Äì the Brahmaputra in Guwahati, Assam and the Thames in London ‚Äì focusing on how the legacy of colonialism continues to affect their social and economic use. Gasworks Link and Project88 Link * Nominated for Visible Award 2015, Tate Liverpool. The project Periferry serves as a point of departure for specific regional and historic concerns that find common ground. The project is located on a ferry, MV Chandradinga, made in 1978. The Brahmaputra River is a trans-national river. It begins in Tibet, where it is known as the Tsangpo, flows through India where it is called the Brahmaputra, through Bangladesh where it is known as the Jamuna and then Padma before flowing into the Bay of Bengal. In a region which lies between two major land masses, South and Southeast Asia, fluxes and migration have been the only constant and identity is not a given. It is ever-changing and needs to be revisited and re-negotiated constantly, especially in the context of the inter-ethnic space. Periferry creates a network space for negotiating the challenge of contemporary cultural production, which has become a necessary component of organising social action. Working with multi-use spaces and structures that are adaptable, it has appropriated a redundant and dysfunctional space. In a state of disuse, space becomes liminal and opens up to new interpretations; this leads to the emergence of what Foucault calls ‚Äòheterotopias‚Äô. Foucault describes the ship as the ultimate ‚Äòheterotopia‚Äô, a fragment of space that contests or compensates for the spaces we usually live in. The project is rooted in the community context and lays emphasis on participation, dialogue, and action. It provides a connective platform for dialogue across artistic, scientific, technological, and ecological modes of production and knowledge.

The band consists of four members: Mat Kerekes (vocals), Nick Hamm (lead guitar), Ryland Oehlers (rhythm guitar), & Eric Hamm (bass). They are currently signed to Run For Cover Records. History =Formation and early releases (2009‚Äì2012)= Mat Kerekes first formed the band in 2009 after departing as the drummer from his previous band, The Sound of Glory. The Sound of Glory was a metalcore band that had a large local following as well as somewhat of a regional following during their years of existence. This band included additional members of Citizen, Nick Hamm and Eric Hamm, on their same respective instruments. Additional members of the band were vocalist Josh Childress (guitarist of The Plot in You) and a second guitarist to The Sound of Glory, Joey Chester. The early material of Citizen displayed a melodic hardcore sound much unlike their present day music. The band released their first demo shortly after formation. Citizen played their first show on January 28th, 2010 at Frankie's Inner City in Toledo, Ohio where they opened for Set Your Goals. In May 2011, the band made an appearance at Bled Fest.The band also released a split EP with The Fragile Season, titled The Only Place I Know. After signing with Run For Cover Records in March 2012, Citizen began recording a Split EP with labelmates Turnover. Run For Cover Records states that this Split marks growth and maturity for both bands as they go from up and coming locals to established national artists. After the release of Citizen and Turnover's split EP on May 22, 2012, Citizen and Turnover went on a summer tour, along with the band Light Years. In September 2011, Citizen released an EP titled Young States which was then reissued the following year in September 2012 by Run for Cover Records. Shortly after the reissue of Young States Citizen went on a supporting tour with bands Aficionado and Mix tapes, followed by a tour with Such Gold, Mix tapes, and Rain dance. Finally, Citizen went on a brief fall headlining tour with State Champs and Candy Hearts as supporting acts. = Youth (2013‚Äì2014) = In February 2013, Citizen began recording their debut studio album Youth in studio 4 with producer Will Yip and released Youth on June 11, 2013. Youth features ten tracks along with a bonus acoustic version of their song \\"How Does It Feel?\\" In an interview with Beyond the Pit Press, when asked how Citizen came up with the title of their album, guitarist Nick Hamm stated that Youth is a coming of age record. After the Release of Youth Citizen played on the 2013 Vans Warped Tour. Following the Vans Warped tour Citizen played a record release show for Youth in their Hometown of Toledo, OH. In June 2014, the band announced they would be going on a fall tour in support of Youth, starting early September in Toronto, Canada, and ending mid-October in Cleveland, Ohio. The tour was supported by the bands You Blew It!, Hostage Calm, Praise, and True Love. = Everybody Is Going to Heaven (2015-2016) = On April 26, 2015 Citizen announced plans to release their second full-length album, Everybody Is Going to Heaven, on June 23, 2015 via Run For Cover. Before the release of the album, Citizen premiered a music video for their song Stain which appears on the album. The album was made available for streaming via Run for Cover's Bandcamp page on June 9, 2015. The album charted at number 2 on the Billboard Vinyl Albums chart. = As You Please (2017‚Äìpresent) = During October 2017 Citizen released their third album, As You Please, with Run For Cover Records. Soon after the release of their third album Citizen began the As You Please Tour, accompanied by Sorority Noise and Great Grandpa. In 2018 the band embarked on a tour in support of The Story So Far along with Turnover and Movements Style AllMusic biographer Jason Lymangrover who called the band's sound a merge of \\"bombastic emo pop, post-hardcore, and thick, chunky indie rock\\". The band has been described as indie rock. Youth has been described as emo, grunge, indie rock, pop punk, post-hardcore, and punk rock. Everybody Is Going to Heaven has been described as alternative rock, emo, grunge and shoegaze. Citizen has been described as a number of genres but in a 2013 interview with Cosmos Gaming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylPcKzZJa6E Guitar Player Nick Hamm states that while people are right to assign those genres to their band he views Citizen as being simply a rock band.

History Habib Uthman bin Yahya was born in Pekojan, Batavia in 1822 CE (17 Rabi' al-awwal 1238 AH). Uthman came from the family of Ba 'Alawi sada with his father was Sayyid Abdullah bin Aqil bin Umar bin Yahya. His mother was Aminah, a daughter of the great scholar of Egypt Sheikh Abdurahman Al-Misri. His father, Abdullah, and his grandfather, Aqil, were born in Mecca, while his great grandfather, Umar, was born in the village of Qarah al-Shaikh in Hadhramaut, which later moved and died in the city of Medina. Snouck Hurgronje explained that his grandfather was a respected scholar as Sheikh of Sadah for 50 years and died in Mecca in 1823 CE/1238 AH. His father moved to Mecca when Uthman was 3 years old, so Uthman was taken care of by his grandfather, Aqil. His grandfather has many other sons, besides the father of Uthman. Many of his sons became scholars in Mecca, such as Sayyid Ishaq, who died in the city of Ta'if, and Sayyid Qasim who continued Agil's leadership as Shaikh of Sada in Mecca. Uthman had family relationship with Habib Ali Kwitang through one of his daughters named Sidah, who married Abdul Qadir, the brother of Habib Ali Kwitang. Uthman died in 1913 CE (precisely on 21 Safar 1331 AH) at more than 90 years of age. He was buried in the Karet public cemetery in Tanah Abang to fulfil his will. Later on, during relocation of the cemetery, his family moved his grave to Kelurahan Pondok Bambu. Now his grave is still well preserved in the south of the mosque Al-Abidin, Pondok Bambu, East Jakarta. Education Uthman studied Qur'an, Tafsir and other Islamic sciences such as Akhlaq, Tawhid, Fiqh, Sufism, Nahwu Sharaf, Hadith and Astronomy under the care of his maternal grandfather, Sheikh Abdurrahman bin Ahmad Al-Mishri. After the death of his grandfather when he was 18 years old, Uthman went for hajj and met his father and relatives in Mecca. There, for seven years he studied Islamic sciences under his father and to Ahmad Zayni Dahlan, the Mufti of Mecca at the time. Uthman continued his journey in the pursuit of knowledge to Hadhramaut 1848. There, He studied under Habib Abdullah bin Umar bin Yahya and his maternal uncle Habib Husein bin Abdullah bin Tahir (later on, one of his teacher's grandson, Sayyid Muhammad bin Agil bin Abdullah bin Umar bin Yahya, married to one of the daughters of Uthman). He also went to and studied in Egypt and once married to an Egyptian woman. He continued his journey to Tunisia, where he often exchanged ideas with Mufti of Tunisia. From Tunisia he then studied in Algeria and later continued to Morocco to study to various Moroccan scholars. He deepened his knowledge in Shariah in those North African countries before roaming to Syria to meet with scholars in the country. He continued his journey to Turkey, which was still under the Ottoman Sultanate. Later he went to Jerusalem in Palestine before returning to Mecca. Career In Rabi 'al-Awwal 1279 AH (1862 CE) he went back to Batavia after 22 years of journey to seek knowledge and settled in Petamburan, Tanah Abang area. Over there, he wrote and compiled books, especially about amalil Yaum (daily remembrances) and books about sins, unbelieving, polytheism and things that contrary to Aqidah. In his life, he has written about 116 books. One of the books he authored, al-QawƒÅnin al- Syar'iyyah li ahli al-MajƒÅlisi al-Hukmiyati wal ‚ÄòIftiayati, was even used as a reference in the religious courts system in Indonesia at least until the 1950s. To make ends meet of him and his family, Uthman founded his own printing company named Pertjetakan Batu. More than that, his lithographic printing press is the first in Indonesia and became pillar of the spreading intellectualism in the society. He also opened his Majelis Taklim (a gathering to seek religious knowledge) which was attended by many people including some other scholars from all over Batavia and surrounding areas, Among his students was Habib Ali Alhabsyi. He also plays an important role in the founding of Jamiat Kheir, an education foundation in Batavia in 1908. Uthman bin Yahya was appointed as Mufti of Batavia in 1871 (1289 AH). The Dutch government paid him monthly stipend since 1889 until his death to advice on Islamic policy, with the title of Honorary Adviser for Arab Affairs in 1891. As a mufti, many parties criticized Habib Uthman for his closeness with the Dutch orientalist, Snouck Hurgronje. Hamid Algadri in his book wrote that his proximity to Snouck Hurgronje was based on his belief at that time that he (Snouck) was a Muslim. He did not know that Snouck only pretended to convert to Islam. The cooperation between Hurgronje and Uthman bin Yahya began when Hurgronje was still in Leiden as suggested in one of Hurgronje's letter on July 8, 1888 CE (28 Shawwal 1305 AH). After his arrival in Batavia in May 1889, Snouck Hurgronje discussed with the newly appointed Governor General Cornelis Pijnacker Hordijk the possibility to employ Sayyid Uthman in colonial administration. Snouck also nominated Uthman as his assistant with allowance of 100 Guldens. Snouck suggested himself pays Uthman discreetly to avoid diminishing his authority among Muslims. All Snouck's requests were granted by the colonial administration Usman bin Yahya was also active in local politics. Along with Hugronje he interfered the appointment of a new Kapten Arab in Batavia in 1901 by supporting and pushing 'Umar Manqush instead of Balwael as the candidate. On March 27, 1905 he was appointed as a native member of the municipal council of Batavia in 1905, but resigned on July 27, 1905. He most probably accepted the brief position under pressure from Snouck. Habib Uthman's attitudes in politics were sometimes quite controversial, especially in his position on jihad and Holy War, particularly concerning a riot against the Dutch in Cilegon, Banten. Although Habib Uthman had good reason in his argument, many scholars considered him as a colonial stooge. Moreover, he was also hard against mystical practices, as he wrote in the book Manhaj al- Istiqamah. In a letter dated March 26, 1891, Snouck wrote about Sayyid Uthman's opinions in regards to jihad which was interpreted incorrectly by some Indonesian Muslims: \\"Many people were 'misled' by some law doctrines of jihad, and they thought that a Muslim person is justified in the presence of God to do acts such as to take possessions of the unbelievers, Chinese or dutch people for himself ... \\" Uthman also assisted Hurgronje by issuing fatwa to support the Dutch war against Aceh. Among other incidents which drew the ire of Batavians and Singaporean Arabs was Habib Uthman's reading of prayer on the occasion of the coronation of Queen Wilhelmina in 1898, at which time the Orde van de Nederlandsche Leeuw (Order of Netherlands Lion) was conferred on him. Calling him as friend of unbelievers, his opponents condemned Habib Uthman in letters to the Arabic Press and pamphlets printed in Singapore. Books written and published Jawi: \\"an Arabic, Malay, Sundanese dictionary\\") by Uthman Usman published religious books in Arabic and Malay (written in Jawi script) on his own lithographic press.

The church was built by the Dutch in 1706 and is a smaller version of the church in the Matara fort. It is one of the oldest Protestant churches in the country. History Kalpitiya was originally known by the ancient Tamils as Kav Putti, and was a popular hub for Arab merchants. In the early 16th century the Portuguese invaded the area, naming the area Kardiv Island. The King of Portugal bestowing the territory to the Jesuits, who built a chapel here, establishing a small garrison to defend it. In an effort to free the port from the Portuguese the King of Kandy, King Rasjasinha II, sought assistance from the Dutch, who in 1659 conquered the area but did not return it to the King, instead they commenced construction of a fort in 1667, which was completed in 1676. Kalpitiya was strategically important for the Dutch East India Company (VOC), as it enabled them to control the external trade of the Kingdom of Kandy, by controlling the large Muslim trading community in the area. The Dutch called the town Calpentyn or Calpetty, occupying the fort there until the end of the 18th century. They also built a small church, with a similar character to the church in Matara. When the British invaded Ceylon, the Dutch soldiers and officials were recalled to Colombo, as a result the British found the fort empty except for a Dutch administrative officer, who promptly surrendered the fort to them. In the beginning of the 1800s when most of the Dutch left the island services at the church stopped. The church was subsequently used by Anglican missionaries. The building was renovated around 1840, when a semi-circular porch with brick and plaster pillars with Corinthian capitals was added, together with three spires on its front gable. The roof of the church has since collapsed. The belfry is original and is similar to the ones found in Galle and Colombo. Around the turn of the century the bell from the belfry, along with all the furniture from the church, was removed to an Anglican church in Puttalam. The original Dutch tombstones can still be found on the church's floor. Interior of the church For a long time the church fell under the management of the Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka. In December 2010 formal ownership of the church was returned to the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC). Renovation of the building is proposed to be undertaken as part of the religious and cultural development of Kalpitiya.

The film had its world premiere on August 14, 2014 in Singapore and had a limited theatrical release in the United States on August 22 of the same year. It was released on to video on demand on August 26, 2014. It stars Shane Johnson as a widowed, atheist filmmaker who finds himself the target of demonic forces. Plot Documentary maker Michael King does not believe in God, the devil, or any other supernatural existence. His wife Samantha believes the opposite. For many years she has visited medium Beverly for spiritual assistance. Samantha was killed in an accident in the United States, while Michael had wanted to travel with her in Europe at the time. Beverly, however, \\"foresaw\\" a major breakthrough in Samantha's attempt to become an actress and advised her to stay in America. Michael confronts Beverly with this. He asks her to admit that she plays false drama and has no contacts with anything at all. Beverly consoles him, but then asks him to leave. Michael struggles to pick up his life again after the death of Samantha. His sister Beth moves in with him to help him care for his daughter, Ellie. Michael decides to make a documentary to prove that there is no paranormal world or afterlife. He argues that such concepts can only be sustained out of human fear of nothingness, by a market that earns big money from it. From that starting point, Michael offers himself as a test subject for the heaviest, darkest supernatural rituals in which some other people believe. He places an advertisement on the internet where people can respond with suggestions for experiments to prove the opposite of his position. Cameraman Jordan will film everything he goes through, 24 hours a day. Michael assumes that he can show that there is nothing. If he is wrong, at least he becomes the first person ever with concrete evidence for the supernatural. There are hundreds of responses to his internet posting. The first of Michael's new internet contacts to visit him is a spiritual named Gibbons, who says that his father systematically sexually abused him in his youth. According to Gibbons, his father died of a heart attack shortly after he prayed to Satan for help. Coincidence, according to Michael. Then he orders stuff on the internet with which he could attempt to call demons. Nothing happens. That is why he visits self-proclaimed demonologist Augustine and his wife Marsha. They give him LSD, bind him to a cross in their cellar and speak spells about him. Michael gets a solid trip, but demons do not appear. In retrospect, he sees on the camera images showing that Augustine and his wife used the opportunity to have sex with each other in his presence. Michael doesn't give up and contacts a funeral director who claims to be a necromancer. He dehydrates Michael, this time with the substance DMT from the body of a toad, that causes psychedelic experiences. Then he takes Michael to a cemetery in the middle of the night. Here he wants to transfer the spirit of a newly deceased person to the body of Michael. Before they are able to get started, the police arrive. Running, they avoid the police. Michael next attends a large group meeting with a medium. She says she is getting a message from a recently deceased woman. The medium says to him \\"Michael, you need to ...\\". Halfway through her sentence she falls to the ground. Michael goes home. His head aches and he suffers from a constant sound in his head: a result of the drugs, he suspects. After an internist tells him that he does not suffer from ringing in the ears, he goes to a psychologist, who tries to get rid of the sound with hypnotherapy. The session is interrupted because the light in the room fails. During this time, Michael moves feverishly through space and begins to shout unintelligibly. Jordan analyzes the camera recording and determines that human vocal chords are not capable of producing Michael's shouts. Michael suspects that there is a defect in the camera. Jordan doesn't believe this and decides to no longer work on the documentary. Michael therefore takes the camera himself from that moment on. Without knowing it, he walks around at night, for example to feel his sister while she sleeps. He is dead during the day. The sound in Michael's head begins to appear more and more often, and is like a talking voice. He becomes convinced that something dangerous has happened to him. Michael therefore asks the voice to leave him alone. A \\"no\\" thunders through his head, and his own image appears on the television screen in the room, mocking him. Michael looks for the funeral owner to ask for help, but he sends him away with the message that it is his own fault. Augustine and Marsha explain that what they did was just for fun and put him out the door. Michael feels less and less in control of himself. At night he goes without knowing it with a kitchen knife to Ellie's bedroom. The next day, Beth finds the dog, Fishbone, dead, in Ellie's bed. Michael sends Beth and Ellie away to stay with friends. Because the church refuses to do an exorcism, he tries to do this at home on his own. His Bible goes up in flames in his hands. The entity that has taken possession of Michael's body throws him around the room and makes him carve a pentagram in his torso. When he sews his injuries the next day, he notices that it hardly hurts to insert a needle through his skin or completely into his thumb. The voice in his head demands that Michael kill Ellie. He refuses and goes after random women and vagrants instead. Michael now seems unable to control himself. That's why he goes home and chains himself with handcuffs to his bed. He wakes the next morning to find that the living room is completely messed up. The walls are full of signs written in blood in Latin. Michael handcuffs himself to his bed again with the key beyond his reach, while the demons are torturing him for not being able to take his body away to do any damages to anyone else living. In the morning Michael wakes up, finding his cuffed up hand, un-cuffed and bloodied. He walks around in his room finding arrows in blood pointing him out and downstairs to the lounge room and TV where on the screen is written \\"Watch this ->\\". He pushes the player button and on the screen appears the recording of the events that happened during the night. He sees that Jordan came by to see how he is doing. He sees the havoc and finds Michael in bed. He releases Michael on condition that he starts to seek help. Michael than rings Jordan's mobile which now is ringing from one of the rooms upstairs, but no one answers. Michael goes back upstairs and finds Jordan dead, hanging from the ceiling with a kitchen knife stuck in the middle of his left hand. Michael picks up a shard of glass and tries to end it, but the entity in him stops his arm. He then swallows the contents of few bottles of pills, but vomits them up. Finally, he tries to electrocute himself by taking a bath with a hair dryer, but the power plug explodes and cuts of the electricity flowing through it. Few hours later Michael is watching TV again which on the screen shows his wife, Sam, speaking into a recorder, from a hospital bed, her face is all stitched up on the areas that were damaged by the car accident, and she is talking about her meeting with Angels and God and trying to convince Michael to not be worried for her well being because she is safe and happy now and she still loves him and Ellie, always. Also she is telling him to never be worried to die a normal death and that she was worried for no reasons about it, but the truth about God and Heaven is real and she has seen it now, and she will be there waiting for the day when they will be reunited again. Michael than talks to himself and his inner demon about the noises and sounds inside his head which he described as \\"white noise\\" being the sounds of Angels tying to interfere and cover up the demon's voice which he can now hear very clearly. Michael is sitting in a rocking chair at the front door. The voice in his head talks to him: \\"We're together now Michael.\\" In the morning Beth enters with Ellie. Michael lifts his sister up with one hand and breaks her neck. Then he goes up the stairs, behind Ellie. As he walks into the room where Ellie is hiding, he finds her, and struggles with the entity for power over his body. The demon is getting more and more powerful. Michael begs Sam for help. The coin which he was carrying around all the time which Sam was holding onto when she died, starts to spin fast while standing on its edge, than stops for few seconds and drops flat. Looking into the mirror, Michael gets momentary control over himself, and uses the opportunity to throw himself out the window. He falls to the street and dies while he hears Sam's voice saying \\"Everything will be alright now\\". =Epilogue (flashback)= On a sunny day, Michael and Samantha are with Ellie and Fishbone in the park. Because the time on the parking meter has expired, he gives his wife a coin to put in the meter. She drops it on the ground near the meter, and she bends to pick it up. Because of this, she does not see the approaching car, which hits her and fatally injures her.

He noticed that The Shining and similar movies that dealt with demonic possession did not tell the story from the viewpoint of the possessed person, and thought that it would be interesting to shift the film's view point to the possessed person. Jung chose to make the film found footage as it would allow the character of Michael to document the events as they occurred, in a \\"scientific approach and personal approach and documentarian approach\\". While researching for the film Jung \\"tracked down a lot of really arcane, occult manuscripts\\", some of which required translation, and also researched rituals that were passed down through oral traditions. In an interview with Nerdist, Jung stressed that he did not want to use rituals that were like \\"a lot of the other stuff that had been explored in the recent mythology\\", as he wanted to avoid \\"Ouija boards and candle lighting\\" as the film's sole staple of demonic rituals. Johnson commented on his role, stating that he spent several months to prepare for the film where he viewed similar films to see \\"what works and what doesn't work\\" as he felt that \\"there's a lot of what doesn't work out there\\". He also researched demonology and necromancy along with viewing films such as The Last Exorcism, which he said made him feel like he \\"came into the project with some ammunition\\". Reception Critical reception for The Possession of Michael King has been predominantly negative and as of October 2014, the movie holds a rating of 29% \\"rotten\\" on Rotten Tomatoes (based on 16 reviews) and 34 on Metacritic (based on 10 reviews). Many film critics criticized the movie for being too overly familiar in how it delivered scares, its found footage aspect, and in its story line. A reviewer for RogerEbert.com panned the film overall, writing \\"What‚Äôs so depressing about fare like this is how creatively uninspired it feels to see the same tricks pulled over and over again. Horror, true fear only comes from the unknown, the unexpected, the unexplained. There‚Äôs never a moment in ‚ÄúThe Possession of Michael King‚Äù that isn‚Äôt telegraphed either by the film itself or from memories of a superior one. It is a work that mistakes loud for scary and turns to camera tricks just to keep you awake.\\" In contrast, Twitch Film commented on the movie's familiarity and stated that \\"While Jung does not necessarily do anything new under the Sun with his jump scares, they are still effective in their execution.\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered also gave The Possession of Michael King a positive review, stating that he had not expected to enjoy the film as much as he had and singled out Johnson's performance as a highlight. Film reviews from horror websites have been mostly positive. Ain't It Cool News Horror praised Johnson's performance while Shock Till You Drop stated that Jung \\"gets the most out of the story and his talent\\". Reviewers for Dread Central were polarized‚Äîas one praised the film for its twists while the other criticized it for having too many \\"cheap scares and found footage tropes\\".

Advice =Bermuda Courts= The judge held that the termination of their employment was to prevent them becoming eligible so they should be paid the linked salaries and because they were in fact entitled to reasonable notice they got the options. The Court of Appeal of Bermuda held that the employment was validly terminated and they were not entitled to participate in the share option scheme. =Privy Council= Lord Millett advised the executives were not entitled to the stock options. Flag Ltd had been entitled to terminate the contracts without cause, and this was not affected by the motive behind the decision to dismiss. The power to terminate did not breach the implied term of trust and confidence, and no requirement for reasonable notice could be implied given the express term allowing for termination of the fixed term contracts.

The four supreme dahije leaders were Kuƒçuk Alija, Aganlija, Mula Jusuf and Mehmed- aga Foƒçiƒá. Rebels against the Ottoman sultan, they were defeated by the Serbs in the initial phase of the First Serbian Uprising, which is also called \\"Uprising against the Dahije\\" (–ë—É–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –¥–∞—Ö–∏—ò–∞ / Buna protiv dahija). Name The renegade janissary leaders were called dahije, from Ottoman Turkish dayƒ±, meaning \\"uncle\\". The lesser janissary commanders were called kabadahije (s. kabadahija), referring to the Turkish phrase \\"kabadayƒ±\\", a colloquial phrase for bullies. Background In 1788, during the Austro- Turkish War (1787‚Äì1791), Koƒça's frontier rebellion saw eastern ≈†umadija occupied by Austrian Serbian Free Corps and hajduks, and subsequently, most of the Sanjak of Smederevo was occupied by the Habsburg Monarchy (1788‚Äì91). The Siege of Belgrade from 15 September to 8 October 1789, a Habsburg Austrian force besieged the fortress of Belgrade. The Austrians held the city until 1791 when it handed Belgrade back to the Ottomans according to the terms of the Treaty of Sistova. With the return of the sanjak to the Ottoman Empire the Serbs expected reprisals from the Turks due to their support to the Austrians. Sultan Selim III had given complete command of the Sanjak of Smederevo and Belgrade to battle-hardened Janissaries that had fought Christian forces during the Austro-Turkish War and many other conflicts. Although Selim III granted authority to the peaceful Had≈æi Mustafa Pasha (1793), tensions between the Serbs and the Janissary command did not subside.The Ottoman Empire and the Serb Uprising, S J Shaw in The First Serbian Uprising 1804-1813 Ed W Vucinich p. 72 In 1793 and 1796 Sultan Selim III proclaimed firmans which gave more rights to Serbs. Among other things, taxes were to be collected by the obor- knez (dukes); freedom of trade and religion were granted and there was peace. Selim III also decreed that some unpopular janissaries were to leave the Belgrade Pashaluk as he saw them as a threat to the central authority of Had≈æi Mustafa Pasha. Many of those janissaries were employed by or found refuge with Osman Pazvantoƒülu, a renegade opponent of Sultan Selim III in the Sanjak of Vidin. Fearing the dissolution of the Janissary command in the Sanjak of Smederevo, Osman Pazvantoƒülu launched a series of raids against Serbians without the permission of Sultan Selim III, causing much volatility and fear in the region. Pazvantoƒülu was defeated in 1793 by the Serbs at the Battle of Kolari. In the summer of 1797 the sultan appointed Mustafa Pasha on position of beglerbeg of Rumelia Eyalet and he left Serbia for Plovdiv to fight against the Vidin rebels of Pazvantoƒülu. During the absence of Mustafa Pasha, the forces of Pazvantoƒülu captured Po≈æarevac and besieged the Belgrade fortress. At the end of November 1797 obor-knezes Aleksa Nenadoviƒá, Ilija Birƒçanin and Nikola Grboviƒá from Valjevo brought their forces to Belgrade and forced the besieging janissary forces to retreat to Smederevo. By 1799, the janissary corps had returned to the sanjak, as they were pardoned by the Sultan's decree. History =Control of the Belgrade Pashalik= Dahije killing Mustafa Pasha. On 15 December 1801 Vizier Had≈æi Mustafa Pasha of Belgrade was killed by Kuƒçuk-Alija, one of the four leading dahije. This resulted in the Sanjak of Smederevo being ruled by these renegade janissaries independently from the Ottoman government, in defiance to the Sultan. The janissaries imposed \\"a system of arbitrary abuse that was unmatched by anything similar in the entire history of Ottoman misrule in the Balkans\\". The leaders divided the sanjak into pashaluks. They immediately suspended the Serbian autonomy and drastically increased taxes, land was seized, forced labour (ƒçitluƒçenje) was introduced, and many Serbs fled the janissaries in fear. Some Ottoman sipahi and Mustafa Pasha's men plotted, and agreed with Serbian knezes to rise against the Dahije, on a given day. Ammunition was smuggled from the Habsburg Monarchy, some given out to the Serbs, and some hid on the Avala. This first attempt to remove the Dahije, erupting a day early in 1802 in Po≈æarevac, was stopped, and the Dahije continued ruling the pashalik. The tyranny endured by the Serbs caused them to send a petition to the Sultan, which the dahije learnt of. The dahije started to fear that the Sultan would make use of the Serbs to oust them. To forestall this they decided to execute leading Serbs throughout the sanjak, in the event known as the \\"Slaughter of the Knezes\\", which took place in late January 1804. According to contemporary sources from Valjevo, the severed heads of the murdered leaders were put on public display in the central square to serve as an example to those who might plot against the rule of the dahije. This enraged the Serbs, who led their families into the woods and started murdering the suba≈üi (village overseers) that had been employed by the dahije, and also attacking Ottoman forces. The dahije sent out the most diplomatic, Aganlija, with a strong force to frighten and calm them down, in order to avoid escalation into armed conflict which would be hard for the janissaries to manage, but to no avail. =Uprising= On 14 February 1804, in the small village of Ora≈°ac near Aranƒëelovac, leading Serbs gathered and decided to undertake an uprising, choosing Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá as their leader. The Serbs, at first technically fighting on the behalf of the Sultan against the janissaries, were encouraged and aided by a certain Ottoman official and the sipahi (cavalry corps). For their small numbers, the Serbs had great military successes, having taken Po≈æarevac, ≈†abac, and charged Smederevo and Belgrade, in a quick succession. The Sultan, who feared that the Serb movement might get out of hand, sent the former pasha of Belgrade, and now Vizier of Bosnia, Bekir Pasha, to officially assist the Serbs, but in reality to keep them under control. Alija Gu≈°anac, the janissary commander of Belgrade, faced by both Serbs and Imperial authority, decided to let Bekir Pasha into the city in July 1804. The dahije had previously fled east to Ada Kale, an island on the Danube. Bekir ordered the surrender of the dahije, meanwhile, Karaƒëorƒëe sent his commander Milenko Stojkoviƒá to the island. The dahije refused, upon which Stojkoviƒá attacked and captured them, and had them beheaded, on the night of 5‚Äì6 August 1804. After crushing the power of the dahije, Bekir Pasha wanted the Serbs to be disbanded, however, as the janissaries still held important towns, such as U≈æice, the Serbs were unwilling to halt without guarantees. The Sultan now ordered the surroundings pashaliks to suppress the Serbs, realizing the threat. The Serbs sought foreign help, sending a delegation to St. Petersburg in September 1804, which returned with money and promise of diplomatic support. The First Serbian Uprising, the first stage of the Serbian Revolution, had thus begun. Government The Janissaries chose four of their leading chiefs (Kuƒçuk Alija, Aganlija, Mula Jusuf and Mehmed-aga Foƒçiƒá) to rule the sanjak after the murder of Mustafa Pasha. The leaders divided the sanjak into pashaluks. Legacy There are many Serbian epic poems regarding the dahija, such as Poƒçetak bune protiv dahija (\\"Start of the revolt against the dahijas\\"), collected by blind bard Filip Vi≈°njiƒá (1767‚Äì1834). When Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladiƒá entered Srebrenica on July 11, 1995, he presented the town as a gift to the Serbian people, and said \\"Finally, after the rebellion against the dahije, the time has come to take revenge on the Turks in this region\\".

It can detect as many as 110 inborn errors of metabolism (\\"IEMs\\", or metabolic disorders) from a urine specimen. Cordlife owns the brand name and trademark, \\"Metascreen\\". History Metascreen, as a newborn metabolic screening test, was first launched by Cordlife in India in October 2013. Since April 2014, Metascreen became available also in Hong Kong and the Philippines through Cordlife for parents looking for more comprehensive screening of metabolic disorders for their children. As a newborn suffering from certain metabolic disorder, such as isovaleric acidemia, may appear asymptomatic in the first few days or even weeks of life, early detection and treatment is key in preventing irreversible lifelong complications, such as physical disability or mental retardation. Technology Unlike the conventional dried blood spot test for newborn screening that involves a painful heel prick, Metascreen uses urine specimen, collected without harm or discomfort to the newborn, to detect as many as 110 metabolic disorders. The urine specimen is collected on a filter paper, which is then air-dried and sent to the laboratory for analysis using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry instrument (\\"GC-MS\\"). GC-MS is a FDA approved method for urinary analyte detection, a gold standard for lipids, drug metabolites and environmental analysis. Many of the IEMs that are classified as \\"organic acidemia\\", in which organic acids accumulate in the urine of newborns with these disorders, are easily and accurately picked up by GC-MS.. The GC-MS platform is recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics for the detection of organic and amino acidemias through the urine. Furthermore, the platform has also been shown to be reliable in detecting other types of IEMs, such as sugar metabolism disorders and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Indeed, GC-MS analysis is increasingly becoming a common way to diagnose IEMs for earlier intervention and treatment, resulting in a better outcome and quality of life. Use of urine as a diagnostic biofluid As a major organ for excretion, the kidney removes waste materials and chemicals from the body, such as increased concentrations of intermediary metabolites of a particular pathway, making urine (the waste product from the kidney) particularly useful for medical diagnostics. The key advantages of using urine as a biofluid are: (1) its sterility; (2) accessibility and non- invasive method of collection; and (3) it being largely free from interfering proteins or lipids. Although the human urine metabolome is a subset of the human serum metabolome, more than 484 compounds identified in urine by Bouatra et al. (either experimentally or via literature review) were not previously reported to be in blood. The same group hypothesised that this is because the kidneys do an extraordinary job of removing and/or concentrating certain metabolites from the blood, hence, compounds far below the limit of detection in blood (using today‚Äôs instrumentation) are well above the detection limit in urine. This difference, combined with the ability of the kidneys to handle abnormally high or abnormally low concentrations of metabolites, makes urine a particularly useful biofluid for medical diagnostics. In fact, urinary metabolites have been used to characterize nearly 220 diseases. Controversies Cordlife announced in October 2013 that Cordlife India has introduced Metascreen service through a strategic collaboration with Navigene Genetic Science, a genetic diagnostic and research company.http://cordlife.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20131010_073220_P8A_B592E3C2C146005048257BFF0037D404.1.pdf In 2014, Navigene was embroiled in a controversy where its founders were accused of data and scientific research theft and fined for INR 3 Million by the Adjudicating Authority of the Department of Information Technology, Government of India.https://it.maharashtra.gov.in/1121/Statement-of- Cases?ID=3http://indianexpress.com/article/mumbai/grammatical-error-nails- copycat-genetic-research-firm/ Navigene rejected all allegationshttp://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-firm-slapped-rs-30-lakh-fine- for-data-theft-1956820 and has filed a writ petition (No. WP/3291/2014) with the High Court of Mumbai to challenge and squash the order.

Early years Keun was the daughter of Gustave Henri Keun, at the time first dragoman and secretary of the Dutch consulate in the Ottoman Empire, and his second wife, Helene Lauro, who was of Italian/Greek ancestry.Monique Reintjes, Odette Keun (1888-1978), Chapter 1, 2000, When her father died in 1902, the family was left in relatively impoverished state. She became rebellious and her mother sent her to an Ursuline boarding school in the Netherlands. After three years she had decided to become a nun and moved to a Dominican monastery in Tours. She resigned two years later and went back to Istanbul. She could no longer find herself in the dogma of the church, the role of the Dominicans in the fight against the Cathars, and, last but not least, celibacy. There was also the more practical reason; after her mother's death, she was the source of support for her sisters. She published her first book \\"Les Maisons sur le Sable\\" (1914) in which she described her farewell to the faith, her views on social problems, and her amorous wishes.  Love and secret services  The first World War brought her to Paris. She worked for the Red Cross in Rouen. At that time, several secret services were interested in her because she expressed strong criticism of British and French colonial politics. After falling in love with him, she traveled to her lover Bernard Lavergne who settled in Algiers. She traveled into the desert on horseback and contributed to health care for the Berbers. Her social involvement was further demonstrated by her call for the Berbers to demand better facilities. A new lover, the Georgian prince Grisha, led her to Georgia. She wrote about this trip and her affair in her book Au Pays de la Toison d‚ÄôOr (1924). In late spring 1921, while staying with friends in Istanbul and two days before she would have travelled to Batum, she was arrested by the British military police, extrajudicially and presumably for her socialist leanings, and was deported to Sebastopol in Russia. For three months she endured the abuses of the Cheka, before she was let go to Charkov. She wrote about her arrest and experiences in Russia in Sous L√©nine.

Between 1924 and 1933 Keun was the partner of H.G. Wells, with whom she lived in Lou Pidou, a house they built together in Grasse, France. Wells, who was 22 years her elder, dedicated his books The World of William Clissold Kevin Dixon, Odette Keun, HG Wells and the Third Way, The PRSD, July 20, 2104.

Wolne Lektury, Fundacja Nowoczesna Polska, Warsaw.) is an 1882 short story by the Polish writer Boleslaw Prus, and is considered a masterpiece of short- story writing. It is a sketch of everyday life of impoverished Warsaw residents. The narrator, the title waistcoat's current owner, reconstructs its history, based on his observations of the lives of its original owner and his wife. The story has been translated into Czech, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Slovak.Janina Kulczycka-Saloni, \\"Kamizelka\\", in Literatura Polska: Przewodnik encyklopedyczny (Polish Literature: An Encyclopedic Guide), vols. 1-2, Warsaw, 1984, vol. 1, p. 416.  Plot  The story is contemporary with its author and plays out in an old Warsaw tenement building. All the action takes place within an enclosed space: the narrator is, as it were, a viewer in a movie theater, whose screen is his neighbors' window across the courtyard. For sentimental reasons, the narrator purchases the waistcoat (vest) of the story's title for half a ruble from a Jewish peddler; it had belonged to the narrator's neighbor. It is faded in front, bears many stains, is threadbare in back, is missing buttons, and has two bands: one, shortened and sewn on, with a clasp; the other, with piercings from the first band's clasp. The vest is in a sorry state from its earlier use, and recalls the previous owner's sad story. The couple to whom the vest had belonged, had moved into the Warsaw tenement in early April. They would rise early in the morning, drink tea brewed in a samovar, and leave together for work: she to the school where she taught, he to the office where he worked. They were gentle young people. The wife was slim and was a part-time seamstress; the husband was sturdy and hard-working, often staying at work till late in the night. Every Sunday they would go out for a walk and return in the evening. In April they were living with a servant girl, from July they were alone, and in October only the wife remained, as her husband had died of the tuberculosis that had been diagnosed by a physician during a home visit. As the husband had been losing weight, he had been shortening one of the vest's bands in order not to worry his wife; and she had been shortening the other one in order to give him hope. Thus they had deceived one another in a good cause. After her husband's death, the woman had left town.

He rebelled and assumed government of Cairo, becoming the acting Ottoman governor of Egypt on 6 May 1803. He was beheaded by a Janissary soldier within a month of acting as governor when he was unable to pay the troops their outstanding pay. Albanian commander Ottoman Albanian troops were sent by the Ottoman sultan in 1801 to fight against the French invasion of Ottoman Egypt under Napoleon, which had occurred in 1798. Tahir Pasha was the commander of the Albanian troops sent by the Ottoman sultan in 1801 to fight against the French. Although successful in ousting the French with significant help from the British, the Albanian troops, led by the other Albanian commander Muhammad Ali, chose to remain in Egypt and gain influence for themselves. Cairo seized In accordance with the Treaty of Amiens, the British evacuated Alexandria in March 1803 leaving a power vacuum in Egypt. Muhammad Bey al-Alfi had accompanied the British to lobby them to help restore the power of the Mamelukes. In their attempts to return to power, the Mamelukes took Minia and interrupted communication between Upper and Lower Egypt. About six weeks later, the legitimate Ottoman governor of Egypt Koca H√ºsrev Mehmed Pasha, finding himself in a financial bind and unable to pay all the troops under his command, attempted to disband his Albanian mercenaries or Albanian bashi- bazouks (or Arnauts) without pay in order to be able to pay his regular other Otomans soldiers. The Albanians, led by Tahir Pasha, refused to disband, and instead surrounded the house of the defterdar (finance minister), who appealed in vain to H√ºsrev Pasha to satisfy their claims. Instead, the Pasha commenced an artillery bombardment from batteries located in and near his palace on the insurgent soldiers who had taken the house of the defterdar, located in the Ezbekia. The citizens of Cairo, accustomed to such occurrences, immediately closed their shops and armed themselves. The tumult in the city continued all day, and the next morning a body of troops sent out by H√ºsrev Pasha failed to quell it. Tahir Pasha then repaired to the citadel, gaining admittance through an embrasure, and from there began a counter bombardment of the pasha's forces over the roofs of the intervening houses. Soon thereafter, Tahir descended with his guns to the Ezbekia and then laid close siege to the governor's palace. The following day, Koca H√ºsrev Mehmed Pasha fled with his women, servants, and regular troops to Damietta along the Nile. Acting Ottoman Governor of Egypt After Koca H√ºsrev Mehmed Pasha fled, Tahir assumed the government. The local judges confirmed him as kaymakam (acting governor) on 6 May 1806, largely because his Albanian troops were very loyal to him. On May 19 there was a disturbance that resulted in the arrest beheading of Master Malati, also known as Moallem Malati, a Coptic Orthodox Church scribe of Ayyoub Bey El-Defterdar. He was one of the Mamluks of Muhammad Bey Abu al- Dhahab and was made general manager of a department to look after national problems when the French under Napol√©on Bonaparte occupied Egypt. After the French left, the rulers of Egypt assumed the responsibility to protect Master Gergis El-Gohary, Master Wasef, and Master Malati. Malati was beheaded at Bab Zoweila in Cairo and subsequently canonized by the Coptic Orthodox Church. Manipulated by Muhammad Ali, two Janissary chiefs confronted him for their jamakiya pay that he was unable to pay. The two drew their swords and rushed at Tahir, and one beheaded him. A prolonged battled then ensued between the Albanians and other Ottoman troops, creating a chasm between the two leading forces. For a time, Mameluks oscillated between the two factions and also considered regaining power on their own behalf. Muhammad Ali, one of the regimental commanders, became the leader of the Albanians. Realizing he had a weaker position than the other Ottomans, Ali entered into an alliance with the Mameluke leaders Ibrahim Bey and Osman Bey al-Bardisi. The two men that killed Tahir Pasha were sentenced to death. Funerary complex In 1819 a funerary complex with a domed mausoleum was established in Cairo of 15th century Mamluk style architecture that was dedicated to Tahir and other family members. It is described in Islamic Art in the 19th Century as the first initiative of Mamluk revival in the 19th century.

It is a bulbous perennial. Description Iris stenophylla has a very similar form to Iris persica. But with different colouring. It has bulb with brown papery tunics,British Iris Society (1997) and fleshy storage roots. The stem can be hidden by the leaves. It normally has one flower per unbranched stem. The flowers appear between March and May in the UK. In America, they can appear earlier.< The flowers normally measure about 5.5-6.5 cm in diameter. They come in a range of shades, between violet-blue or lilac- blue. The falls have normally a darker blade with a violet spotted whitish area. It has a yellow or orange crest. The perianth tube is about 6‚Äì9 cm long. The leaves are shorter than the stem at blooming time. They later grow up to 10‚Äì25 cm long and are between 5-10mm wide. Unusually unlike other Juno irises they do not have a white margin. They grow from the base of the plant, they are slightly falcate (sickle-shaped) and greyish-green. The allisonii subsp. was thought to have more leaves than the type. It has 3-3.5 cm long, ellipsoid capsules. The brown seeds do not have an aril (coating). =Biochemistry= In 2002, a morphological and cytological study was carried out on Iris stenophylla subsp. stenophylla and Iris stenophylla subsp. Allsoni. This determined that there was not enough difference between the two subspecies, therefore 'Iris stenophylla subsp. Allsoni' is a synonym of Iris stenophylla.

After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the French traveler Pierre Gilles observed that around 1540 the reservoir was empty, but its usage as a reservoir could have ceased already in the late Byzantine era, since then it was known under the name of Xerokepion (ŒûŒ∑œÅŒøŒ∫ŒÆœÄŒπŒøŒΩ, \\"Dry Garden\\" in Greek).Mamboury (1953), p. 325 According to a tradition, the cistern was directly connected to the Hagia Sophia, which lies about three kilometers southeast, through a passage situated towards the mid of the southeastern side and closed around the middle of the 19th century. During the reign of Sultan Suleyman I (r. 1520-66), a small mosque was built inside the reservoir. During the Ottoman period, as its Turkish name √áukurbostan (\\"hollow garden\\") betrays, the structure was used as a vegetable garden; afterwards it hosted a small village, surrounded by orchards and gardens.Eyice (1955), p. 62. As of 2004, the village, except for its mosque, had been demolished to allow the construction of a car park.Freely and √áakmak (2004), p. 55. The site is now used for a park and sport fields. It was used for a while as an \\"Education Park\\" () of Fatih, but this has ceased.Altun (2009), p. 140. Identification problem As for other cisterns of the city, the identification of the cistern of Aspar followed only around the middle of the 20th century. It is known from the Byzantine sources that the reservoir lay near the palace of Manuel, the monasteries of Kaiouma, of the Chrysobalanton, of Manuel, of the Theotokos of \\"t√° Koronƒós\\" (), and of the monastery of Saint Theodosia. There were two crucial elements which led to the structure's identification: its erection near the wall of Constantine, and its description as \\"large\\" (). The reservoir has been successively identified with: a cistern located near the Bodrum Mosque; the vaulted cistern located southeast of the √áukurbostan of the Gate of Adrianople of the Theodosian walls and known as Zina Yokusu Bodrumi; the cistern near the Sivasli Dede Mescid, placed to the southeast of the Yavuz Selim Mosque; the √áukurbostan of the Gate of Charisius, (later certainly identified with the Cistern of Aetius). The first two reservoirs can be excluded since they are too far from the wall of Constantine, moreover, the second is small. The third cistern has large dimensions, but lies also too far from the ancient wall, while the fourth, although lying near the wall, is also too small. The only reservoir which satisfies both requisites, of large dimensions and of a position near the old wall, is that known in Istanbul as Yavuz Selim √áukurbostanƒ± because of its proximity with the Yavuz Selim Mosque; this led to its identification with the Cistern of Aspar towards the middle of the 20th century. Description The Cistern of Aspar in 2013 The cistern has a square plan with a side long covering an area of : its average depth lies between and . It could contain about of water. Its walls, m thick and partially still in place, were built using the Roman construction technique named opus listatum by alternating five courses of bricks and five courses of stone, an elegant pattern similar to that also used by the cistern of Aetius. On the inner walls are visible remains of arches, a fact which has led some to assume that the cistern may have been covered. The Cistern of Pulcheria is located near the Cistern of Aspar's southeast corner.

Description Iris tubergeniana has a similar form to Iris orchioides and Iris caucasica.Richard Lynch It has a slender bulb, about 2 cm thick. With cord-like roots. It has generally about 6 leaves, 2.5-3 in tall, 0.5-2 in wide (1.5-2.5 cm) at the widest point, which are almost fully mature at flowering time. They are pale green, \\\\- light glaucous green, pointed or sickle shaped, striated, with a margin. The margin is scabrous/horned. The short flowering stem is about 10‚Äì15 cm (4 in) high at flowering time. It has 1-3 flowers, blooming between March and April, which are unscented. It has a perianth tube measuring between 4.5‚Äì5 cm long, which is tinged slightly greenish purple. It has (5.6 cm wide) flowers, in shades of yellow, from deep yellow, to bright yellow to greenish-yellow. The falls are about 1.5in long, and have a frilled, dissected beard-like crest, with violet- green spots on the sides of the ridge. It has very small standards (about 10 mm). It has (a seed capsule) fruits which appear in late spring and early summer. Taxonomy It was published by Sir Michael Foster as Iris tubergeniana in Gardeners Chronicles, Series 3 in 1899. It was named after the bulb company of 'Van Tubergen' from Haarlem, the Netherlands who introduced to the UK. In 1941, Alexi Vvedenski published it as Juno tubergeniana in 'Flora Uzbekistan' (edited by Schreder). This was later re-classified as a synonym as Juno's were re-classed as part of the iris species. It was also cited in 'The Plantsman' in 2003, on page 54. Iris tubergeniana is now an accepted name by the RHS, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 3 October 2014. Native Iris tubergeniana is found in Central Asia and the former states of USSR, within Uzbekistan, (including on Chimgan, and beside the river Syr Darya ,) Tajikistan and Turkestan, and on Karatau in Kazakhstan. It can also be found near the town of Dzabaghly near the Aksu Canyon in the Tien Shen Mountains. =Habitat= They prefer the red clay and gravelly slopes of the foothills of mountains. Cultivation It is better grown in an alpine house, but it could be grown outside in sunny sheltered sites.

Career Fedorkina first took up rowing when she was ten years old after a rowing coach did a presentation of the sport at her school, but she found it boring. A school friend who was fencing suggested her own sport instead. Coach Galina Gashinskaya took an immediate interest in her after noticing she was left-handed. Despite early evidence of talent Fedorkina stopped training in sixth grade because of the harsh discipline, but Gashinskaya, who lived across the street, joined with her mother to badger her into coming back. After beginning with the foil Fedorkina moved to sabre under the training of Gashinskaya's husband Oleg. Her first medal in a major event was a bronze medal at the 1999 Cadet World Championships in Dijon, followed by another bronze medal at the 2001 Junior European Championships in Keszthely and at the 2003 Junior World Championships in Trapani. She began fencing in the senior category in the 2002‚Äì03 season and climbed the podium in her first World Cup competition with a bronze at the Moscow Grand Prix.

They contribute a great deal of their time and resources towards the development of poetry among the youth in secondary schools. Origin The Lantern Meet of Poets started as a group of old school friends from Namilyango College who came together at the university with the passion for literature which they turned into a poetry club. Together with friends from Mount Saint Mary's College Namagunga, they elected to spend time together in a university dome room sharing poetry for the love of poetry. Odyssey Raymond Ojakol, Collins Assiimwe, Guy Mambo and Alal B. Sophia formed the Lanmtern Meet of Poets in Africa hall, a residential girl's hall at Makerere University in 2007. With the idea that as a cultural group they were entitled to access to the national cultural institution(National Theatre). They first meet moved away from the university residential hall to the national theater. The early meets were closed to invited members only and the participants were asked and expected to introduce new members. They eventually decided to open the meet up to non invited guests and the first recital had no title, organized by Kunihira Rachel. With memorized poems they fused music, drama and poetry in this recital. They have held several recitals since then; *Tells by the Camp fire‚Äô first poetry production in the main theater auditorium, supported by Okurut Romanio, Which turned out to be a turning moment in the attendance of poetry meets. *Fresh court of paint *Foot prints of verse.

The idea that we all come to the lantern meet to serve with service for and to as the ultimate honorific. *Anonymity Established tradition of fairness and impartiality in critiquing which lead to the establishment of the tradition of honesty. The incidental tradition of the walk back to the university campus, affectionately called ‚Äòthe walk‚Äô was used as an opportunity to heal possible offences. *Purposefulness The opening of the meet introduced more people who had a deep passion for literature and had actually studied it in their secondary school years. Their introduction into the community brought a new wave of thought and a deeper conviction in the quality of poetry and the desire to have less of the appreciation poet to more of a literary poet. *Restorative Starting with the ‚ÄòBroken voices of the revolution‚Äô production, the Lantern Meet introduced a deliberate discussion which would lead to the harmonization of thought on what it is that the Lantern Meet of Poets wants to transmit to the audience. This process lead to a concretization in taught. School projects Starting 2009, the Lantern Meet of Poets visit schools to develop literary arts especially poetry. The process entails; forming writers or poetry clubs, encouraging the students to meet regularly, (weekly meet), write new poetry, prepare for recitals, self organize, work with other schools and the Lantern Meet of Poets and to work with other schools; e.g. Nabisunsa Girls Secondary School, Gayaza High School, Turkish Light Academy, Kings College Budo, St. Mary's College Kisubi.

The Demonstration was the last phase of the unsuccessful attempt to establish a constitutional monarchy in France. After the Insurrection of 10 August 1792, the monarchy fell. Background Under the Girondin ministry, on 20 April 1792, war was declared against Austria. The resulting war, which would last almost continuously until 1815 and shake the very foundations of Europe, put new life into the revolutionary movement in France. The monarchy was its first victim. Of even greater consequence was a major economic crisis. As it struck France's towns, it again set the masses in motion. The crisis was caused by inflation rather than scarcity as past crises, as the currency in circulation had increased by 600 million since October 1792. With continued depreciation of the assignat, the exchange rate fell even more rapidly. By March 1793, French money once worth British ¬£100 would buy only ¬£50 worth of goods in Paris. The flood of paper notes, misused by speculators, aggravated unrest. =Military setbacks= France declared war on the King of Bohemia and Hungary (Austria) on 20 April 1792. The French troops and their leadership were inadequate from the beginning, leaving the French army in a state of total disarray. The front-line regiments were insufficiently strong because most men preferred to enlist in volunteer battalions, which were better paid, elected their own officers, and could disband after the campaign. But despite these attractions, even the volunteer battalions were slow to form. Few volunteers were truly motivated to fight. Frequently, National Guardsmen, not wishing to leave their homes, offered bonuses to convince others to take their place and to muster the necessary quotas. Consequently, it took time for a sufficient quantity of men to enlist. Equipment was furnished by local authorities but arrived slowly, and insufficient arms were available. French general Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez thought the army could get its training in combat. He argued that the enemy had no more than 30,000 men to throw into a campaign, and that foreign troops would be arranged in a cordon from the sea to Lorraine. He proposed to break through this barrier: one column each from Furnes, Lille, Valenciennes, and Givet, totalling more than 50,000 men, would set out on 29 April towards the enemy line. The other generals, however, were trained for regular war and rejected this plan. Additionally, the officers distrusted their undisciplined troops, while the troops were suspicious of their generals in return. Out of 9,000 officers, at least half had already emigrated, and a few more deserted on the eve of the offensive. In May, several others took three regiments into the enemy camp. The first military confrontation, the capture of Porrentruy in Switzerland on 28 April, was a small French success. However, in the Battle of Marquain in the Austrian Netherlands on 29 April, Th√©obald Dillon and Armand Louis de Gontaut ordered a retreat at the sight of the first Austrian troops. Their men cried treason and disbanded; Dillon was murdered at Lille. The generals blamed these setbacks on a lack of discipline and on a ministry that tolerated such conditions. In reply, the Gironde ordered Dillon's murderers prosecuted, along with Jean-Paul Marat, who had been exhorting the soldiers to get rid of their generals. A new decree tightened military justice and authorized the generals to issue regulations bearing penalties for infractions. The decree undeniably marked a surrender of legislative power, but to no avail. On 18 May, the leaders of the armies, meeting at Valenciennes, disregarded repeated orders from the ministry and declared an offensive impossible, advising the king to make immediate peace. As a result, the generals suspended the offensive. In May, a whole corps, the Royal-Allemand, defected to the enemy. Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, commander of the Arm√©e du Nord, resigned. Assembly member Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette went as far as deliberate treachery. Secretly, he proposed to the Austrians that fighting should be suspended so that he could turn his army against Paris in order to disperse the Jacobins and establish a strong regime. =Decrees of the Assembly= The Girondins saw no choice but to fall back on the policy of intimidation that had brought them to power. With this goal in mind, the Assembly passed three decrees. The first decree was directed against the priests who had refused the oath to the civil constitution. Religious disturbances necessitated some decisive action against them, as the state could not be preserved if it continued treating as members of society those who were evidently seeking to dissolve it. One proposal suggested assembling the non-juring priests in the capitals of the departments, but this would have meant creating eighty-three centers of discord, fanaticism, and counter- revolution. The majority of the Assembly concluded the country must be purged. After several days of discussion, fearing the overthrow of the constitution, the Assembly passed the following decree on 27 May 1792: \\"When twenty active citizens of a canton shall demand that a nonjuring priest leave the realm, the directory of the department must order his deportation if the directory agrees with the petition. If the directory does not agree with the demand of the twenty citizens, it shall determine through committees whether the presence of the priest is a threat to public peace, and if the opinion of the committee supports the demand of the twenty petitioners, the deportation shall be ordered.\\" This decree made the clergy choose between the oath to the constitution and deportation. This measure was followed by another directed against the king's bodyguards. The guard had revealed anti-revolutionary sentiments and had uttered threats against the Assembly. The guard was believed to be royalist in its sympathies; wholly devoted to the person of the king; hostile to the government; and wholly lacking in esprit de corps. Assembly member Claude Basire proposed the guard's dissolution, charging its officers with orgies and a plan for carrying away the king. He asked to be allowed to give proof of his accusations the next day. Meanwhile, fellow Assembly member Fran√ßois Chabot declared that he had 182 documents proving the existence of a plot to dissolve the Assembly, set for 27 May. In response, the Assembly decreed that its sessions should be continuous; that the Paris guard should be doubled; and that Paris's mayor, J√©r√¥me P√©tion de Villeneuve, should be required to make a daily report on the state of the capital city. Regarding the king's bodyguards, Assembly member Marguerite-√âlie Guadet articulated three arguments for the guard's dissolution: first, that it was illegally organized; second, that its chiefs sought to inspire revolt; and third, that the majority favored a counter-revolution. On 29 May 1792, the Assembly decreed that the guard should be dissolved and its commander, the Duc de Brissac, arrested. This decree was executed immediately. The third decree provided for a camp of 20,000 f√©d√©r√©s (French National Guardsmen) to be assembled on 14 June near Paris. French general Joseph Marie Servan de Gerbey made this proposition on 4 June, reportedly without consulting either his colleagues or the king. He argued that the initiative was necessary to establish tranquility in the country. The decree itself stated that its purpose was to improve fraternity between the departments of France. However, discussions in the Assembly indicated that the decree's purpose was to ensure public security. As allies were approaching from without and enemies of the constitution were plotting from within, Paris and the Assembly needed protection. =Fall of the Girondin Ministry= King Louis refused to sacrifice the non-juring priests or to authorize the establishment of a military camp of f√©d√©r√©s. On 12 June 1792, a letter from Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Plati√®re, Louis' Minister of the Interior, urged the King to yield on these two points, stating that his refusal would provoke the fall of the throne and a massacre of the aristocrats. The next day, the King dismissed Roland, along with √âtienne Clavi√®re, his Minister of Finance, and General Servan. On 15 June, General Dumouriez's reception by the Assembly was hostile enough to convince him that he would be arraigned. Since the King insisted on approving only the decree disbanding his guard, Dumouriez resigned and left to rejoin the Army of the North. The Feuillants returned to power in a new ministry. On 18 June, Lafayette, judging that the moment had come, called on the Assembly to destroy the democratic movement, declaring: \\"[The] Constitution of France [is] threatened by seditious groups within the country as well as by its enemies abroad.\\" The King's use of the royal veto, his dismissal of the Girondin ministers, and the formation of a Feuillant ministry all served to show that he and the generals were attempting to enforce the political program advocated by the followers of Lafayette and Alexandre- Th√©odore-Victor, comte de Lameth. They were seeking to get rid of the Jacobin threat, revise the Constitution so as to reinforce royal authority, and bring the war to an end by making a deal with the enemy. Journ√©e du 20 juin Faced with the threat of a coup from either the royal family or the Feuillants, the Girondins tried to make use of the popular dynamism evident in sections of Paris. The Parisian mayor, P√©tion, was sympathetic to their cause and helped the Girondins in these attempts. The anniversary of the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June was approaching. Sergent and Panis, the administrators of police sent out by P√©tion, reached the Faubourg Saint-Antoine at about 8 o'clock. They urged the people to lay down their weapons, telling them it was illegal to present a petition in arms. The people refused to abandon their arms and said they did not intend to attack the Assembly or the King. They said they had two objectives: to form a procession for the twenty legal petitioners who wished to present a petition to the Assembly and the King, and to celebrate the anniversary of the Tennis Court Oath by planting a maypole in military fashion. By five o'clock in the morning on 20 June, groups had formed in the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marcel, consisting of National Guardsmen, pikemen, gunners with their cannon, men armed with sabers or clubs, women, and children. Other armed petitioners had already appeared before the National Assembly. To prove to the city officials that they had no desire to riot, they invited the officials to join the procession and march along with them. The Legislative Assembly met about noon on the 20th, but did not turn its attention first to the threatened uprising. After some other business had been discussed, the president announced that the directory of the department wished to be admitted. The directory had shown great interest in trying to prevent the procession and had been in session since four o'clock in the morning. Pierre Louis Roederer, the procureur of the Paris department, brought the news about the mass protest to the Assembly. However, in the meantime, the crowd had reached the doors of the Assembly hall, the Salle du Man√®ge. Their leaders asked permission to enter and present a petition. A violent debate arose between the Right, who were unwilling to admit the armed petitioners, and the Left, who, on the grounds of custom, wished to receive them. Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud argued that the Assembly would violate every principle by admitting armed bands; however, he admitted that it was impossible to deny a request in this case that had been granted in so many others. A majority of the representatives agreed that the petitioners should be allowed in. However, the crowd had already thronged the passages when the Assembly decided to admit them. The deputation was introduced. The deputation's spokesman, Sulpice Huguenin, expressed himself in threatening language. He said that the people were agitated; that they were ready to make use of the means stated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen to resist oppression; that the dissenting members of the assembly, if there were any, wanted to destroy liberty and go to Koblenz. Then, returning to the true object of the petition, he added: \\"The executive power is not in union with you; we require no other proof of it than the dismissal of the patriot ministers. It is thus, then, that the happiness of a free nation shall depend on the caprice of a king! But should this king have any other will than that of the law? The people will have it so, and the life of the people is as valuable as that of crowned despots. That life is the genealogical tree of the nation, and the feeble reed must bend before this sturdy oak! We complain, gentlemen, of the inactivity of our armies; we require you to learn the cause of this; if it springs from the executive power, let that power be destroyed!\\" The Assembly answered that it would take the petitioners' request into consideration; it then urged them to respect the law and the legal authorities, and allowed them to march before the Assembly. Led by General Antoine Joseph Santerre, thirty thousand people, waving revolutionary banners and symbols, sang, as they traversed the hall, the famous chorus, √áa ira, and cried: \\"Vive la nation!\\" \\"Vivent les sans- culottes!\\" \\"√Ä bas le veto!\\" On leaving the Assembly, the group proceeded to the King's chateau in the Tuileries Palace, led by the petitioners. Journ√©e of 20 June 1792 The outer doors were opened at the King's command, and the crowd rushed in. They ascended to the apartments, and while they were forcing the doors open with hatchets, the King ordered them to be opened, and appeared before the crowd, accompanied by a few persons. Louis XVI was placed in the recess of a window. Surrounded by National Guardsmen, who formed a barrier against the mob, and seated on a chair placed on a table, Louis remained calm and firm. The crowd urged Louis to approve the decrees he had rejected. Louis responded: \\"This is neither the method nor the moment to obtain it of me.\\" Attempting to mollify the mob, he placed on his head a red cap presented to him on the top of a pike. The crowd viewed this as a sign of humility. He then drank a glass of wine given to him by a half-drunken workman, and received strong applause. Meanwhile, Assembly members Vergniaud and Maximin Isnard, along with a few deputies of the Gironde, had moved forward to protect the King and attempt to calm the mob. The Assembly, which had just met, convened again quickly, terrified at this outbreak, and dispatched several successive delegations to try to protect Louis XVI. Eventually the mayor himself, P√©tion, arrived; he mounted a chair, harangued the people, and urged them to withdraw quietly. The people obeyed. Thus, these singular insurgents, whose only aim was to obtain decrees and ministers, retired without achieving their mission. Aftermath The demonstrators of 20 June did not obtain the immediate successes they had hoped for. The day's events were disowned by the Left of the Legislature, by the future Girondins, and by the Jacobins. Louis XVI, who had promised nothing, did not withdraw his veto. The petitioners thought they had converted him to the Revolution; instead, they found him to be embittered, humiliated, and irremediably hostile. Europe saw the King insulted and treated as a prisoner. In parts of France, royalism regained popularity. A large number of departmental administrations protested against the insult offered to the majesty of royalty. Lafayette, leaving his army, visited the Assembly on 28 June, demanding in the name of his soldiers that the Assembly take action against the protesters, and \\"destroy a sect capable of infringing the national sovereignty.\\" But on 2 July came the news that the Army of the North was in retreat and was falling back on Lille and Valenciennes. This made all the distrust and anxiety of the petitioners of 20 June seem justified. In the Assembly on 3 July, Vergniaud denounced all the \\"treasonous\\" acts of Louis XVI. He recalled the royal veto, the disturbances it had caused in the provinces, and the deliberate inaction of the generals who had opened the way to invasion. Furthermore, he suggested to the Assembly ‚Äì though by implication rather than directly ‚Äì that Louis XVI might qualify under the Constitution as being \\"considered to have abdicated his royal office.\\" Thus, he put the idea of deposing the King into the public's minds. His speech, which made an enormous impression, was circulated by the Assembly through all the departments of France. It was now certain that there would be a more violent sequel to the demonstration of 20 June 1792. Jacobin Jacques Nicolas Billaud- Varenne outlined a program for the next insurrection: exile the King, dismiss the generals, elect a National Convention, transfer the royal veto to the people, deport all public enemies, and exempt the poor from taxation. This program was repeated, almost unchanged, in a strongly worded manifesto drawn up by Robespierre, and proclaimed by a federal orator before the House. The real question was how it would be carried out. The answer came on 10 August 1792 with the storming of the Tuileries Palace.

Note the border with China marked with a discontinuous darker pink line ‚Äîunlike Kengtung State to the south and North Hsenwi to the north. Panlong Subtownship is a subtownship of the Wa Self- Administered Division of Shan State,Map of Shan State formerly and conterminously part of Hopang District. Its main town and capital is Pan Lon, also known as Panlong and Pang Long, which was settled in the 19th century by Panthay people, mainly followers of Du Wenxiu, who had found refuge in the Wa States after having suffered persecution in China. The refugees were allowed to reside in the town by paying a tribute to the local Wa saopha. History In the latter half of the nineteenth century the adherents to the Panthay cause, chiefly Hui migrants from Dali, Baoshan, Shanning, Menghua and elsewhere in southern and western Yunnan, were persecuted by the imperial mandarins in China. Wholesale massacres of Panthays followed. Many fled with their families across the Burmese border and took refuge in the Wa States where, about 1875, they set up the exclusively Panthay town of Panlong, becoming the de facto rulers of the area as their wealth and power increased.Scott, J. George, GUBSS, 1, i (Rangoon Government Printing, 1900), p. 740 According to Sir George Scott, at least 15 years after the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion, the original Panthay settlements had grown to include numbers of Shan and other hill peoples. Scott considered the Panthays the wealthiest and most powerful community in the border region of the Shan States. He further mentioned that there was scarcity of water in Panglong while describing the town:Scott, James George, Sir. 1935. The Wa or Lawa: Head-Hunters. In Burma and Beyond. In addition to the main settlement of Panglong, two other smaller PanthayPanthay; Burmese Chinese Muslims villages 'which had about eighty houses', Panyao and Pachang, were established about 12 miles distant to the south and east respectively. The dominant group in the villages were the Panthay. George Scott comments that these Chinese Muslims were 'all merchants, mule-owners and men of substance'. Considering this wealth Scott concluded that it was only the military prowess and superior armaments of the Panthay which kept their annual tribute to the Wa saopha of Son Mu, one of the northern trans-Salween Wa States,\\"Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan states\\" fixed at the low figure of 100 rupees per annum. By the time Scott visited Panglong ‚Äì at least 15 years after the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion ‚Äì the original Panthay settlements had grown to include numbers of Shan and other hill peoples. The Panthay were, generally speaking, affluent enough to employ these more recent settlers as mule-drivers and 'to do the drudgery generally'. In large measure this affluence must have been due to the lifting of the Qing proscription on Hui settlement in Yunnan (c. 1888‚Äì1890), as a result of which the Panglong \\"Panthays\\" were able to re- establish trading contacts with their fellows remaining settled within Yunnan. As a result of this development, a number of the original refugees returned to China, merely maintaining agents at Panglong; certainly Scott noted that as many of the Panthay caravan traded into China as throughout the Shan States from Panglong. =20th century= Initially the relations between the Wa ruler and the Muslim settlers had been cordial, with the Panthay headman paying a largely symbolical tribute to the Wa, and over the first thirty or so years the Panthays of Panlong continued to prosper while keeping the Wa people at a distance. However, by the early 1920s a feud had begun to develop between the Panthays and the Wa of neighbouring Phankham (Pankawn) who initially had welcomed them into their territory. According to British colonial historian G.E. Harvey, by 1926 this uneasy situation erupted into the local \\"Wa Panthay War\\", in which the latter were victorious and as a result of which Panlong threw off its vassalage to Phankham and reinforced its dominance over the trade routes of the region.Harvey, G E, 1932 Wa precis, Rangoon 1933 In addition to legitimate trading, by this time the Panthays of Panlong were securely established as 'the aristocrats of the opium business' in the region now commonly designated the Golden Triangle, leaving the Petty and risky business of peddling this highly profitable commodity locally to Shan and Han Chinese dealers, and instead running large, well-armed caravans in long- distance convoys far into Siam, Laos, Tonkin and Yunnan. When Harvey visited Panlong in 1931 he found that Panthay numbers had risen to 5,000 ('including local recruits'), that they were financed by Singaporean Chinese, had 130 mauser rifles with 1,500 mules, and exported opium by the hundredweight into French, Siamese and British territory, each muleload escorted by two riflemen. Meanwhile, despite the relative importance of Panlong and the profits to be made from the long-distance caravans, other Panthays moved further into Burma, initially as miners anxious to exploit the ruby mines of Mogok, the Baldwin silver mines of Namtu in Northern Shan State, as well as the jade mines of Mogaung in Kachin State. Numbers of Panthay restaurateurs and innkeepers, merchants and traders settled in the urban centres of upland Burma ‚Äì chiefly at Lashio, Kengtung, Bhamo and Taunggyi ‚Äì to service the needs of these miners, passing caravaneers and the local inhabitants, whilst other settlements largely devoted to trade with the indigenous Shan and Karen populations sprang up along the Salween River. Finally, other Panthay elements moved to the major urban centres of the Burmese lowlands, most notably to Mandalay and Rangoon, where they flourished as merchants and representatives of their upcountry fellows, as well as middle-men between Panlong and the other \\"Overland Chinese\\" settlements of Upper Burma and the \\"Overseas Chinese\\" community of the lowland port-cities. Bassein and Moulmein must also have attracted some Panthay settlement, the latter port being a terminus of the overland caravan trade from Yunnan in its own right, via the northern Thai trade route through Kengtung, Chiang Mai and Mae Sariang. During the greater part of the period of British rule in Burma these Panthay settlers flourished, specialising in all levels of commerce from the international gem markets to shop ‚Äì and inn-keeping, mule-breeding and peddling or hawking ‚Äì indeed Yunnanese peddlers (who may or may not have been Muslim) even penetrated into the unadministered and inaccessible hill tracts of \\"The Triangle\\" between Mali Hka and Nmai Hka, to the north of Myitkyina. Chiefly, however, beyond the urban centres of the Burmese lowlands, the Panthays continued their involvement in the caravan trade with Yunnan, transporting silk, tea, metal goods and foodstuffs, including eggs, fruit, nut and even the renowned Yunnanese hams (doubtless for consumption by their Han fellow countrymen) from China to Burma, and carrying back European manufactured goods, broadcloths, specialised foodstuffs (edible bird's nests, sea slugs) and above all raw cotton, to Yunnan.Harvey, G E, Translations of the history of Panglong, Rangoon 1935‚Äì36 In 1931 Harvey estimated the population of Panlong (which was predominantly Panthay) at 5,000 persons. Yet official estimates put the Panthay population of Burma at 2,202 for 1911 (1,427 males and 775 females), whilst by the 1921 Census of India this had declined to 1,517 (1,076 males and 441 females), and by 1931 to 1,106 (685 males and 421 females). Despite living in the hill areas of Wa State, these mountain Hui Muslims perceived themselves as Chinese people and traditionally have resisted identification with the Wa and other ethnic groups. They vehemently reject the label of 'hill tribe' that is generally used to refer to the inhabitants of the region.Andrew Forbes & David Henley, Traders of the Golden Triangle, Chiang Mai 2011 The settlement of Panlong was raided and damaged by the Imperial Japanese Army troops who invaded Shan State along with the Northern Thai Army in 1942 and 1943. Panglong, a Chinese Muslim town, was entirely destroyed by the Japanese invaders. The Hui Ma Guanggui became the leader of the Hui Panglong self defense guard created by Su who was sent by the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China to fight against the Japanese invasion of Panglong in 1942. The Japanese destroyed Panglong, burning it and driving out the over 200 Hui households out as refugees. Yunnan and Kokang received Hui refugees from Panglong driven out by the Japanese. One of Ma Guanggui's nephews was Ma Yeye, a son of Ma Guanghua and he narrated the history of Panglang included the Japanese attack. An account of the Japanese attack on the Hui in Panglong was written and published in 1998 by a Hui from Panglong called \\"Panglong Booklet\\". The Japanese attack in Burma caused the Hui Mu family to seek refuge in Panglong but they were driven out again to Yunnan from Panglong when the Japanese attacked Panglong.

Speaking to the Quietus website, Tom Robinson of BBC 6 Music named it one of his top 13 albums of all time =Unearth= According to Andy Gill of The Independent, Grasscut's second album, Unearth, should have been on the Mercury list. Both records won 5-star reviews from the Telegraph; support has also come from the Sunday Times, Word, Uncut, Time Out, Q and Clash. They have had airplay from BBC Radio 1, 2, 3, 5Live and 6Music, and have played sessions on 6Music and XFM. = Everyone Was a Bird = In May 2015 Grasscut released their third studio album titled Everyone Was a Bird.

The album features guest vocals from Adrian Crowley and Seamus Fogarty and strings by Emma Smith and Vince Sipprell. The liner notes were written by acclaimed landscape writer Robert Macfarlane and were premiered on the website Caught by the River in April 2015. = Everyone Was a Bird - Remixed = In March 2016, online magazine The Quietus announced Grasscut's fourth album was to be a remix album.

Although they performed early shows as a duo, Grasscut have usually been joined onstage by drummer Aram Zarikian (Andreya Triana) and string player Emma Smith (Geese, Elysian Quartet, Jon Hopkins, James Yorkston, Imogen Heap, Hot Chip). They are also known for their use of visuals, originally developed with As Described (Portishead, Cinematic Orchestra).  Link to landscape  Grasscut are known for their landscape- based concepts, usually emerging in collaboration with Pedr Browne (also responsible for the Grasscut artwork). 1 Inch: ¬Ω Mile came with a map detailing a walk through the ‚Äòlost‚Äô village of Balsdean, just outside Brighton. An audio clue, contained within a downloadable track, provided details of the location of a hidden artefact: a unique recording on a cassette. This idea was extended on Grasscut‚Äôs second album, Unearth. Each track was reimagined by Phillips, and these ‚Äòshadow‚Äô versions ‚Äì again on cassette ‚Äì were secreted, each with a Walkman, in specific locations around England and Wales.  Use in media  Grasscut's music has been used on the soundtracks of The New Pope, Waterloo Road, andContinuum. Their music has also been used by BBC, Channel 4, and in major advertising campaigns worldwide.

In 1760, Beranger went to Ireland to join family members there. Beranger opened a print shop and artist's warehouse at 5 South Great George's Street, Dublin, and followed the profession of an artist. Charles Vallancey and William Conyngham became his patrons and found him a government situation in the Dublin exchequer office. In later life Beranger was financially independent, after a bequest from his brother-in-law. He died at the age of 91 or 92, and was interred in the French burial-ground in Dublin.

The album was inspired by Arvo P√§rt, Philip Glass, Henryk G√≥recki, Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Saint-Sa√´ns. He said about how the songs are instrumental that \\"the pieces on it are the in-between moments when I found it all too much to write a clever rhyme.\\" He also said \\"as someone who writes songs about my own experience, as honestly as I can, I find myself looking for new emotional wells to draw from all the time. But over the years I have found there are certain subjects I have been unable to mine.\\" The second song on the album is \\"Elevator Song\\", which he said \\"wrote while daydreaming and thinking about a breakdown I had in an elevator in Glasgow.\\" Release On June 16, 2014, the album was released without any prior announcement or promotion and streamed on The Guardian's website. It was released as a digital download and on CD. A deluxe vinyl edition was later issued via The Vinyl Factory, initially in a run of six limited editions, each of 100 copies. These quickly sold out and were followed by a further run of 1000. Those copies sold out quickly as well and were followed by another printing. A non album song called \\"Sand\\" was also made as a free download not long afterwards through his online store. The first video, for \\"Earnestly Yours\\", was released on 4 July 2014, premiering on Clash. On 2 September 2014, he released a video for \\"Healah Dancing\\".

It forms the entirety of State Route 26. Manning Road, along with the suburb of Manning, is named after the Manning family, significant landholders in the early years of the Swan River Colony. Henry Lucius Manning purchased land in the vicinity of Mount Henry (near modern-day Salter Point) in 1840, and likely sent his younger brother Charles Alexander Manning to conduct business on behalf of the family, rather than travel to the colony himself. By around 1866, the Manning had a large estate bounded by the Canning River, Henley Street, and Mount Henry. In 1913, the family divided the estate into 27 lots, three of which, near Canning Bridge, became further subdivided into urban lots. The Mannings retained much of the property until 1948, when the state government resumed the land to create a model suburb originally name Manning Park. Manning Road was the name given to Public Road No 123. The road's condition was the subject of much public discussion in the 1950s. A proposal was drawn in the 1980s to construct a southbound on-ramp at the western terminus with the Kwinana Freeway. The land requirements were included on the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme. The City of South Perth considered the ramp a \\"major priority\\" that would increase its road network connectivity, reduce traffic congestion, and improve commuter safety. In 2001, the City estimated the construction cost to be $1.77 million. Construction of the ramp commenced in October 2019 at a cost of $35 million. The ramp opened on the morning of 13 July 2020.

It was close to St. Peter‚Äôs Square, within the Civic Quarter of Manchester city centre. It was demolished in April 2017, to be replaced by Landmark, a 14-storey office building, as part of a major transformation of the area.  Pre 1930  The location of the theatre had originally been developed towards the end of the 18th century; by the 1930s the site had been fully developed, featuring a mix of commercial and residential properties. By the start of the 20th century, the site was used entirely for commercial purposes, and it featured two pubs. The site was cleared by 1930 for the construction of the Paramount Theatre.  Cinema  The Paramount Theatre on Oxford Street, Manchester, opened on 6 October 1930, showing The Love Parade, and featuring a variety show on stage. The theatre was built for the Paramount Film Company of America, and was designed by Frank Verity and S. Beverley (now known as Verity & Beverley), who had also built the Plaza Theatre in London. It was one of 50 proposed Paramount Theatres, and was one of the first open, and the first in the UK to bear the company's name; others included Paramount Leeds, Paramount Newcastle upon Tyne, Paramount Glasgow, Paramount Liverpool, Paramount Birmingham and Paramount, Tottenham Court Road, London. A single-screen cinema, it was capable of seating 2,920 people on two levels (the Stalls and the Balcony), and the building also contained a fully equipped stage, a fly tower, dressing rooms, an orchestra pit, an organ and a cafe. The cinema was designed to operate in the cine- variety era; it was mostly used to show films (such as those featuring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald) but it also put on live stage shows (including those by Francis A Mangan, which were accompanied by a full orchestra). It was purchased in November 1939 by Oscar Deutsch as part of the Odeon Theatres Ltd, and was renamed as the Odeon in 1940. It became a Rank cinema in 1941. Its piano lounge subsequently hosted Bruce Forsyth among others. The building featured a stone-faced fa√ße with four bays, and a full- width canopy, both facing Oxford Street. The cinema had three levels, one of which is a mezzanine. The foyers and auditorium were decorated in a Baroque style; the building also had a large rounded proscenium and an illustration of the sky on the ceiling. The theatre was divided in 1973 to become a twin screen cinema, at which time the organ was removed. It gained a third screen in 1979, and four more screens were added in 1992 using the basement and stage areas; it opened as a seven-screen cinema on 8 May 1992. The cinema had a private car park with a small number of parking spaces to the rear. In 1992, it hosted the premiere of A Few Good Men. The theatre originally had a Wurlitzer Publix One theatre organ with 4 manuals and 20 ranks of pipes, specified by Jesse Crawford. It was planned to install one of these in each of the 50 Paramount theatres, however this was the only one to be installed, and the only one of that model to leave the United States. When the theatre was divided, the organ was acquired by the Lancastrian Theatre Organ Trust, loaned to the City of Manchester and relocated to the Free Trade Hall (a process taking four years); and was first used there in September 1977. When the Free Trade Hall closed, it was subsequently moved to the Stockport Town Hall's Great Hall. The cinema closed in September 2004 after 74 years in use, due to competition from the AMC Great Northern. After its closure, it was occasionally used as a church. In 1999, the building was considered for listed building status as part of a thematic survey of cinemas, however it was rejected as too many of the original features had been removed. When the cinema closed in 2004, the orchestra pit, stage, proscenium, ceiling and foyer areas were still partly intact (although hidden), and could be restored. It was thought to be the oldest cinema in Manchester's city centre. However, an additional assessment in February 2007 also rejected listing the building; English Heritage explained that this was due to the extensive removal of its original features and the extensive interior damage to the building. It was claimed that this damage had been \\"systematic and methodical\\", although the current owners stated that they had only carried out \\"limited and entirely lawful exposure works\\". It was certified as being immune from listing on 25 July 2007 (renewed 28 November 2012). Permission to demolish the building was given in September 2016. The building was demolished in April 2017.  Office building  The site of the cinema after demolition The cinema is scheduled to be replaced with an office building named Landmark, matching the adjacent One St Peter's Square. The building will have of office floor space over 14 storeys, as well as a three-level 116-space basement car park, in a 0.18 hectare site. It is being developed by Hines UK Limited and Manchester & Metropolitan Properties Limited, and designed by Squire and Partners. Planning permission was originally obtained on 15 February 2007, and was due to be completed in 2009. At the time, the building aimed to hold 2,000 workers, and would cost ¬£45 million. The permission was extended in September 2010. and renewed in August 2013, with some tweaks to meet BREEAM 'excellent' standards. Construction is not planned to start until market conditions are suitable ‚Äì in particular, until pre-let deals have been arranged with the first occupiers.

His discoveries concerning the production of the hormone vasopressin laid the foundation for the field of hormone biosynthesis. Early life and education  Sachs was born in the Brownsville, Brooklyn in New York City on July 1, 1926, to Leo and Bessie Sachs. He attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. During World War II, Sachs served in Okinawa from 1944 to 1946. He attended Brooklyn College on the G.I. Bill, graduating with a B.S. in 1949. He earned an M.A. in organic chemistry from Columbia University in 1950 and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Columbia in 1953, under the supervision of Professor Erwin Brand. Scientific career  Sachs joined the faculty at Case Western Reserve University in 1957 and was made a full professor in 1966. He left Case Western Reserve to become the section chief of neurochemistry at The Roche Institute of Molecular Biology. Through his research, Sachs discovered the relationship between neurophysin, an intracellular chaperone protein and vasopressin, the neurohormone that is critical for maintaining water balance in the body. He hypothesized that neurophysin and vasopressin are both part of a larger, inactive precursor protein, a prohormone, which is then enzymatically cleaved and processed within the secretory granule to produce and secrete both peptide products.Sachs H, Takabatake Y. Evidence for a Precursor in Vasopressin Biosynthesis. Endocrinology. 1964; 75943-8. Sachs' hypothesis preceded the discovery of proinsulin by 3 years, and his research laid the foundation for understanding the biosynthesis of all brain peptides and many proteins, which are major constituents involved in brain and neuroendocrine functions. Sachs showed that vasopressin was first synthesized as a prohormone in specialized nerve cells (called neurosecretory cells) in the hypothalamus and was then transported to the nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary where the vasopressin peptide was completely processed during axonal transport in secretory granules and ultimately secreted into the blood.Sachs H, Fawcett P, Takabatake Y, Portanova R. Biosynthesis and release of vasopressin and neurophysin. Recent Prog Horm Res. 1969; 25447-91. He also showed that brain tissue could be kept intact and functional for two months in tissue culture, and contributed to the understanding of the interactions between the neuroendocrine neurons and neuroglial cells in the hypothalamal- neurohypophysial system (HNS).Pearson, D., Shainberg, A., Malamed, S., and Sachs, H.: The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial complex in organ culture. Effects of metabolic inhibitors, biologic and pharmacologic agents. Endocrinology 94: 994-1003, 1975.  Medical career  At the height of his research career, Sachs left The Roche Institute of Molecular Biology to go to medical school. In 1976 he received an M.D. from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.

Plot Holly Pollard is in an undergrad student in a directing program at her college. She forsakes her advisor's direction to do a standard play for her first production opting instead to adapt an 1980s young adult novel called The Children's Reaper for the stage. The book is about a group of children terrified and abused by their seemingly overly-religious foster parents. Holly has had the book since she was a teenager and has written her name and the year 1993 when a young girl inside the front cover to signify the book belongs to her. Through rehearsals, we watch her young cast struggle with the material as they hone their performances. They have myriad reactions to the way the material and the rehearsals affect their real lives including their sexuality and personal interactions. Holly is also sleeping with Jarrett, who appears to be a Junior Advisor at school. Eddie is married with a pregnant wife. Adam is struggling with coming out. Brandon is openly and almost fiercely bisexual. Madeline admits that a kiss during a rehearsal was actually her very first kiss. Madeline also struggles with doing a nude scene. Eventually, During a drunken post-rehearsal party, Madeline asks Terra to make out with her while, elsewhere in the building, Adam and Brandon hook up and, within the next few days, seem to begin a relationship. William Peters (Austin Pendleton) the author of the book comes to rehearsals. While walking together with Adam their discussion leads Adam to wonder if the older man is also gay. When one of the actors is sick, he helps with a scene but he seems overwhelmed and has to stop. He continues to stay in town and come to rehearsals often nitpicking at Holly's way of presenting the adaptation. Eventually it is obvious that the source material is autobiographical and seeing it performed is causing Peters great mental anguish. On opening night a girl brings Brandon flowers backstage although he insists it is not what is seems. Holly hears Madeline's family discussing how they should look away during a part of the performance. Peters leaves on a plan without seeing the performance. Overall, the performance goes well. Seemingly a few days later, at home, Holly opens her worn copy of the novel we have seen her carry throughout the production. Under where she has written her name and 1993, the author has written his name, William Peters, and the current year, 2013.

Cone has stated that elements of the plot were inspired by the 1987 film adaptation of V. C. Andrews's Flowers in the Attic. Release Black Box first premiered at the 15th Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival in Birmingham, Alabama on August 25, 2013. The film had a limited film festival run, playing at the Cucalorus Film Festival, the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival, and the LGBT Reeling Film Festival, where Black Box made its Chicago premiere in November, 2013. =Media= Though a critics' poll by Indiewire named it the seventh best film of 2013 to remain undistributed, Black Box was eventually picked up by Devolver Digital Films for a cable/VOD release in late 2014. Reception Despite a limited release, Black Box received a very positive response from critics. Newcity's Ray Pride called the film \\"ambitious\\" and praised Pendleton's performances as \\"ever-fascinating.\\" Paul Bower of the online magazine Tiny Mix Tapes further lauded the film, saying \\"Preparing a play, rehearsing and fleshing out the writing, forces its participants to get super vulnerable (if it‚Äôs done right, anyway) and face things about themselves in front of a group of other people that can cause all sorts of embarrassment if done in a hostile environment. The great thing about Stephen Cone‚Äôs Black Box is that it understands this terrifying thing about doing theater to such a devastating extent that the film can, rightly, become hard to watch at times.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3¬Ω out of 4 stars, calling it \\"a worthy follow- up to Cone's previous film\\" and adding, \\"I hope Cone keeps writing and making movies because he has what a lot of other writer-directors do not: an interest in character; a facility for drawing fine, subdued on-camera work from stage performers; and a knack for pulling together a variety of sympathetic characters at a crucial point in their collective lives.\\" References External links Category:Films directed by Stephen Cone Category:2013 films Category:2013 drama films Category:2013 LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:English- language films Category:Films shot in Illinois Category:American drama films ","title":"Black Box (2013 film)"},{"id":"43721586","text":"FK Rakytovce is a Slovak association football club located in Rakytovce.FK Rakytovce (Slovensko) 02.09.2014, futbalnet.sk It currently plays in 4. liga (4th tier in Slovak football system).

Among the city's most remarkable edifices were the Round Church, also known as the Golden Church, and the imperial palace. At that time was created and painted Preslavian pottery, which followed the most prestigious Byzantine models. A chronicle of the 11th century testified that Simeon I had built Preslav for 28 years. Simplified floor plan Preslav Simeon I gathered around himself the so-called Simeon's circle, that included some of the most prominent literary authors in medieval Bulgaria. Simeon I himself is alleged to have been active as a writer: works that are sometimes credited to him include Zlatostruy (Golden stream) and two of Simeon (Svetoslavian) collections (first in transcript of 1234, and the second - in 1299).

The names of the other authors of Simeon circuit were Tudor Dox, Prester John and Prester Gregory but none of their works are preserved. They were all venerating the liturgy in Old Bulgarian language and the Cyrillic script created in Bulgaria few years before the reign of Simeon I, during the reign of his father Boris I of Bulgaria. Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav created (or rather compiled) the new alphabet which was called Cyrillic and was declared the official alphabet in Bulgaria in 893.

In 2003 he obtained his PhD from the National University of Singapore for research carried out at the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering. This was followed by postdoctoral work at the M.E. Mueller Institute for Structural Biology at the Biozentrum until 2008. In 2009, he was appointed Argovia Professor for nanobiology at the Biozentrum and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute, where he received tenure in early 2014.  Work  Lim is interested in nucleocytoplasmic transport regulation, its impact on cellular function, and how this phenomenon can be leveraged towards bio-inspired applications. He studies how karyopherin receptors facilitate this highly rapid and selective process through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Lim combines biophysical, nanotechnological, and cellular approaches to unravel the emergent physical principles that underlie biological function and then verify the results in biomimetic systems. His key contributions include a karyopherin-centric model of the NPC and the discovery of two-dimensional transport control in artificial systems. Of late, he has gravitated towards mechanobiology, in particular cell motility and cancer progression. Lim is a co-inventor of ARTIDIS (\\"Automated and Reliable Tissue Diagnostics\\"), an atomic force microscope-based innovation for cancer diagnosis.

Population: History In 1851, a railway station was open, and in 1866, the textile (wool) factory was constructed close to the station by merchant Varentsov. Novozavidovsky originated as the settlement around the station and the factory. In 1913, the name of the settlement was Alexandrovka; it is not exactly clear when the name Novozavidovsky began to be used. The name of the station originates from Zavidovo, a nearby village and currently a residence of the President of Russia, and the name of the settlement was transferred from the name of the station. In 1926, Novozavidovsky was granted urban-type settlement status. Until 1922, Novozavidovsky was a part of Klinsky Uyezd of Moscow Governorate. On July 12 1929, the Governorate was abolished, and the area was transferred to Moscow Oblast. Uyezds were abolished as well, and Zavidovsky District, with the administrative center in Novozavidovsky, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Zavidovsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. On November 14, 1960 the district was abolished and merged into Konakovsky District. On February 13, 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Konakovsky District was merged into Kalininsky District, but on January 12, 1965 it was re-established. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast. Economy =Industry= In Novozavidovsky, there is a mechanical plant producing cranes and specialized trucks. There is also a textile factory, mainly producing hats. =Transportation= The railway station of Zavidovo at the Moscow ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway is located in Novozavidovsky. It belongs to the Leningradsky suburban railway line and is connected by regular passenger suburban service with both Moscow (Moscow Leningradsky railway station) and Tver. Novozavidovsky has a road access to the M10 highway, which connects Moscow and St. Petersburg. In the opposite direction, it is connected to Tver via Kozlovo and Turginovo. Culture and recreation The Memorial Museum of Spiridon Drozhzhin is open in Novozavidovsky. The house where Drozhzhin, a poet who lived in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, built this house in the village of Nizovka, which was later submerged by water at the construction of the Ivankovo Reservoir. The house was transferred to Novozavidovsky and open as a museum. It was considerably damaged during World War II and restored later. It currently exhibits personal belongings of Drozhzhin and shows an exposition on his life. Novozavidovsky contains four cultural heritage monuments of local significance. They are the house and the tomb of Spiridon Drozhzhin, as well as two monuments to the soldiers fallen in World War II.

The film deals with the theme of kids getting involved in criminal activities. The film became a commercial and critical success in India. The direction and script style were inspired by the late 1990s to mid 2000s \\"Crime Encounter\\" film trend from Hindi cinema, which boasted films such as Satya, Shool, Company, and Ab Tak Chhappan. Plot The film is shot in a non-chronological order, with the plot continuously moving back and forth in time. The story starts a year in the past: A top cop Pradeep Sharma presents himself before the court in an unknown case. A college teen named Anirudha Rege slowly becomes engulfed in the criminal underworld when he crosses the path of a mysterious small-time gangster named \\"M Bhai\\". He is depressed by the fact that he has to become a doctor, just because his father is a famous doctor. When he first witnesses M Bhai's ability to get away with crime during a Hindu religious celebration, Rege becomes enamored at his power. He and his friend Pakya decide to join M Bhai's gang activities, bullying citizens, bribing police, and spending time at brothels. Rege's father, a successful doctor and dean of a hospital, becomes suspicious of Rege's whereabouts, but Rege assures him everything is fine. Meanwhile, police inspector Pradeep Sharma, who is accused of laundering money to pay for expensive properties managed by Agrawal Industries, is an expert in encounters and strong-arms gangsters into bending to his whim. He crosses paths with M Bhai's goons when he crashes a wedding celebration, but M Bhai and his men escape just in time. Sharma and his right-hand man, Sachin Waze, uses their own men to track them down. Rege's friends try to get him to run for secretary in elections, but this is stalled after another candidate uses his criminal relations to convince Rege to drop out. However, the opposing candidate realizes Rege's connections with M Bhai and he himself drops out instead. Rege tells his friends to go, and they start to become concerned with his entanglements with his gangster friends. M Bhai then takes Rege along with his men to have some \\"fun\\", however they instead go on a mission to kill off Agarawal (of Agarawal Industries) who manages Pradeep Sharma's properties. Back in the present, the Pradeep Sharma is jail and is in complete control of his case. His lieutenant Waze is now managing the show. He takes the builder lobby into confidence and tries to bribe the judges, public prosecutor, etc. On the other hand, his seniors are also fighting tooth and nail to convict Sharma in the case. They arrange for false witnesses and they also raise a lobby to influence the judge. Waze is countering these moves by killing the false witnesses lobbying to change the judges. Back in flashback we see Rege comes out of the vehicle and witnesses the murder of Agarwal builder. The others in gang vouch to kill him, but M bhai is against the idea and spares Rege. M Bhai drops his men off at Rege's farmhouse and tells Rege to go to the bar and forget everything that has happened. Rege is seen at the whore-house extremely drunk. He is picked up by Sharma's men and brought to the police station where he is interrogated and threatened with violence. Rege is extremely scared and repents for what he has done. However, Sharma comes to the station and reasons with Rege privately in congenial manner to spill everything that happened with M Bhai's gang. As Rege reveals the events, Sharma realizes M Bhai could still be at Rege's farmhouse. Sharma's men head over with Rege and capture M Bhai and his men, who are soon after executed in a crop field. Rege feels guilty and foolish as Sharma lets him go home. But in the climax, it is revealed that Sharma killed Rege just to complete his century (100) of encounters when Waze persuades him by telling him that,\\"Sachin Tendulkar had waited for a year to complete his century of centuries\\". The final scene shows Rege's mother crying in front of his pictures and \\"Happy Birthday\\" playing in background as Rege is killed on his birthday. In the present day, Pradeep Sharma is under arrest for disobeying his police superiors orders and abusing his power. He is periodically interrogated and derided by a panel of chief inspectors. Waze attempts to gain favors with lawyers, politicians and judges to appeal his case. He is eventually acquitted of all charges. Cast  Critical reception  Almost all critics including Maharashtra Times gave Rege 4 stars and said that Rege is a film that is very Marathi in the foundation of its story and yet, it is a film that Marathi cinema hasn't seen before. They have also appreciated the supporting cast saying they have been justifiably cast. Box office The film collected in first three days. Total Box Office Collection nearby 6 crore.

Biography =Early life= Robert Atkinson Gibson was born in Petersburg, Virginia to the founder and long-time rector of Grace Church, Rev. Churchill Gibson (1819‚Äì1895) and his wife Lucy Fitzhugh Atkinson Gibson. His formal education began at Episcopal High School at Alexandria, Virginia, from where he transferred to Mount Laurel Academy; he then attended Hampden‚ÄìSydney College near Farmville. However, he interrupted his studies in 1864 to volunteer with Virginia's First Rockbridge Artillery, not returning to Hampden‚ÄìSydney until after the Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox in 1865. Upon graduating in 1867, Gibson enrolled at the Virginia Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1870 and was ordained as a deacon on July 24 by Bishop Whittle. Kenyon College in Ohio awarded him a doctorate of Divinity in 1897, as did University of the South. =Ministry= As deacon, Gibson worked to revive parishes in five counties along the James River in southeastern Virginia. On July 4, 1871, Bishop John Johns ordained him as a priest in Petersburg. Rev. Gibson then served as assistant to Rev. Joshua Peterkin at St. James Episcopal Church in Richmond from 1872 to 1878. He then moved to Parkersburg, West Virginia where he served as rector of Trinity Church until 1887, when he accepted a position in Cincinnati, Ohio and continued as rector of Christ Church (which became that city's cathedral when another church was destroyed in 1937) until 1897, when his native diocese called him back to assist bishop Whittle.Tyler, Lyon G., Men of Mark in Virginia (Washington, D.C. 1906) at pp. 100‚Äì101 available at Google books =Episcopacy= Consecrated on November 3, 1897, bishop Gibson served under bishop Whittle for five years until the latter's death, handling most diocesan visitations as well as administration for several years. While also a popular society figure in Richmond, bishop Gibson became known for his simplicity, sincerity and reverent conduct. Upon returning to Virginia, he bought a summer cottage near Orkney Springs, Virginia, which was expanded after his death into Shrine Mont, a diocesan retreat center. Rather than immediately appoint a coadjutor as probable successor, Rt.Rev. Gibson created three archdeacons with specific charges. One archdeacon specialized in administrative matters, another was assigned to \\"Colored Work\\", and a third (Rev. Frederick Neve) expanded the diocese's ministry into isolated rural areas, building schools and churches in the Blue Ridge with the help of deaconesses. Bishop Gibson also designed the diocesan seal for the 1907 General Convention that met in Richmond (which last hosted in 1859), which remains in use today. Most of Virginia's black parishes were founded during his episcopate. Bishop Gibson also sought to repossess, restore and reopen many colonial churches (especially in the Tidewater region) which had fallen into ruin. While the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia split off from that of Virginia during Bishop Whittle's episcopate in 1892, with much of the central and southern Tidewater region, the diocese of Virginia split further as anticipated, creating the Episcopal Diocese of Southwestern Virginia in 1919 (for lands south of the James River but not in the Diocese of Southern Virginia).. In 1907 the General Convention met in Richmond to honor the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement. When it was over, and especially since Bishop Gibson wanted to travel to London for the Pan Anglican Congress of Mission as well as the once-per-decade Lambeth Conference, he sought help, requesting the special diocesan council elect a coadjutor in 1908. However, the first choice, Rev. Berryman Green, declined.Edward L. Bond and Joan R. Gundersen, The Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1607-2007 (Diocese of Virginia 2007) p. 133 In 1909, the Diocesan council met again and elected Rev. Arthur Selden Lloyd as Bishop Coadjutor, but he resigned the position 14 months later to become President of the Episcopal Church's Board of Missions, which position he left in 1921 to become Suffragan Bishop in the Diocese of New York, where he served until his death in 1936. Upon bishop Lloyd's resignation, William Cabell Brown, who had been a missionary in Brazil, was elected Bishop Coadjutor, and recalled. He ultimately succeeded Bishop Gibson. Shrine Mont altar Family Rev. Gibson married Susan Baldwin Stuart on November 12, 1872. They had two sons (Rev. Alexander Stuart Gibson and Rev. Churchill J. Gibson) and three daughters (Lucy and Mary did not marry, but Frances married missionary Rev. Edmund Lee Woodward).http://genealogytrails.com/vir/dinwiddie/bios_g.htm citing Encyclopedia of Virginia Biographies, vol. IV Death and legacy Bishop Gibson died in Richmond and is buried at Hollywood Cemetery. The altar in the diocese's open-air Cathedral Shrine of the Transfiguration at Shrine Mont, built by Rev. Woodward after his retirement with the assistance of two local men, is dedicated in his memory, and a cottage named after him.

Biography The son of Checochinican (Chickoconecon), chief of the Fish Clan of the Turtle tribe, Nemacolin was born near the Brandywine Creek, probably close to the Swedish trading post at Fort Christina that later became Wilmington, Delaware. By a treaty with William Penn in 1726, various tribes either rented or gave up their land on both sides of Brandywine Creek. Nemacolin likely grew up near Shamokin, Pennsylvania, a village near the Susquehanna River to which the Delaware had retreated when faced with disease and colonization of their traditional lands by white settlers. His family grew to know trader Thomas Cresap, and moved south and west with the Cresap family, likely after a controversy between groups of settlers aligned with the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania known as Cresap's War.Daniel S. Murphree (ed), Native America: A State-by- state Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 at p. Circa 1750, Cresap received instructions to improve the Native American path across the Appalachian Mountains through the Cumberland Narrows. He hired Nemacolin and his two sons, among others, to complete the task between Will's Creek (a trading post on a tributary of the Potomac River later the site of Fort Cumberland) and the mouth of Redstone Creek on the Monongahela River (a tributary of the Ohio River) which later became Redstone Old Fort and even later Brownsville, Pennsylvania. A side trail led to the residence of Christopher Gist. Gist led George Washington along Nemacolin's Path in 1753 and 1754. It was later improved to permit supply wagons for General Edward Braddock's army, and the General ultimately died on the route in 1755 after the disastrous Battle of Fort Necessity which began the French and Indian War. About 1759, as the war ended, Nemocolin reblazed the path to the residence of James Burd which became Fort Burd and later renamed Redstone Old Fort.http://www.nemacolin.net/fayettecounty.html Another branch went to Uniontown, PennsylvaniaWilliam J. Switala, The Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania, (Stackpole Books, 2001) at pp. 42-43 Later years and death After blazing the trails, Nemacolin moved the remainder of his tribe to a site alternately known as Shawnee town or Neal's Landing on Blennerhassett Island, in the Ohio River, in what became West Virginia.Charles Augustus Hanna, The Wilderness Trail, Or Ventures and Adventures of Pennsylvania Traders on the Allegheny Path (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1911) vol. 2 pp. (identifies two island settlements as Upper Shawnee Town and Lower Shawnee Town, possibly Oldtown, Maryland and Blennerhassett ialand After the peace treaty, as he had after blazing the trail with Cresap and Gist, Nemocolin renewed his tribe's claim that Penn and subsequent settlers had broken the treaty terms in establishing permanent settlements in what had been his tribe's lands, to no avail.Dawn G. March, A Lenape among the Quakers, (University of Nebraska Press, 2014) pp. 72-73 Nemacolin died on the island in 1767, and European settlers soon laid claim to that land. Legacy After the American Revolution once again permitted trans-Allegheny settlement, settlers named the route for the general rather than the Native American ally. Decades later, the National Road was built over parts of Nemacolin's Path.Archer Butler Hulbert, Washington's Road or Nemacolin's Path (A.H.

The site now known as Nemacolin's Castle in Brownsville may well have been visited by Chief Nemacolin, for a fireplace dates from the late 18th century, and the site had been inhabited by Native American peoples (probably the south Algonkian-speaking Shawnee who may have had mounds there). However, that building was long known as Bowman's castle, after three generations of merchant- industrialists.http://www.nemacolincastle.org/history.html References Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1710s births Category:1760s deaths Category:18th-century Native Americans Category:Lenape people Category:Tribal chiefs ","title":"Nemacolin"},{"id":"43721842","text":"Fincha Airport is an airport serving Fincha in Ethiopia.

Chappell however denied this, stating that he never contemplated Tendulkar replacing Dravid as captain.

It was produced in two versions (Limousette and Coup√©) based on the Fiat 500 (1957‚Äì1977). Like the Neckar Pully, the Weinsberg was the creation of NSU/FIAT Karosseriewerke Weinsberg, made possible because NSU/FIAT in Heilbronn also had its own development department, in which designers such as Antonio Fessia worked. Introduced in March 1959 as the NSU/Fiat, 6,228 vehicles were manufactured from 1959 to 1963. The price was 3,840 DM in 1959, 3620DM in 1962.  German modification  NSU-Fiat Weinsberg Limousette, Baujahr 1960 Two Weinsberg versions were sold at 3,840 DM (including heater and sunroof, whitewall tires were an extra 50 DM) - the Coupe and the Limousette. They differ only in the rear window design: The coup√© features a wraparound panoramic rear screen, allowing only enough headroom above the rear seat for small children (up to about 7 years old). The Limousette has rear side windows and a steeper, conventional rear window like a small sedan, hence the name. This gives the Limousette a little more headroom than the coupe, but less than a Fiat 500 Nuova. Both Weinberg models are basically two-seaters with additional space for two children or luggage. Despite having an inviting padded rear seat, it is not practical for adults. The German tire used in the Weinsberg is 4.40x12‚Äù size rather than the 125 x 12 of the normal Fiat 500, indicating that the Weinsberg was regarded as a two-seater; the utmost load capacity was slightly less than the slightly wider 125 ‚Äì 12. In contrast to Autobianchi Bianchina, both Weinsberg versions were built from partially assembled car bodies with modifications to both front and rear panels. The front bonnet is higher, as is the wing profile, with finned rear wings and with rear lights that are unique to the Weinsberg. The cars benefited from some equipment upgrades in character with a luxury version: a sunroof instead of a folding roof, bug ornament, special bumpers, standard two-tone color and wheel covers, ashtray in the dashboard, better upholstery fabrics and wide pockets in the doors. The luggage space is greater, made possible by the fact that the higher bonnet allows the spare wheel to be placed on the tank. The first version side trim was soon replaced by a contrasting colour side stripe. The Weinsberg's driving performance and handling characteristics match the Fiat 500. Daily production peaked at 14 cars. Weinsberg 500 Coup√©s Other companies built cars based on the Nuova 500, under license, such as Steyr-Puch in Austria, Simca in France, Polski Fiat in Poland and Autobianchi in Italy.

The above definition of an E-inversive semigroup S is equivalent with any of the following: * for every element a ‚àà S there exists another element b ‚àà S such that ab is an idempotent. * for every element a ‚àà S there exists another element c ‚àà S such that ca is an idempotent. This explains the name of the notion as the set of idempotents of a semigroup S is typically denoted by E(S). The concept of E-inversive semigroup was introduced by Gabriel Thierrin in 1955.Manoj Siripitukdet and Supavinee Sattayaporn Semilattice Congruences on E-inversive Semigroups , NU Science Journal 2007; 4(S1): 40 - 44G. Thierrin (1955), 'Demigroupes inverses et rectangularies', Bull. Cl. Sci. Acad. Roy. Belgique 41, 83-92. Some authors use E-dense to refer only to E-inversive semigroups in which the idempotents commute. More generally, a subsemigroup T of S is said dense in S if, for all x ‚àà S, there exists y ‚àà S such that both xy ‚àà T and yx ‚àà T.

The building remained unfinished and is still unknown which pharaoh was really intended to be buried here since no appropriate inscription has been found. Pyramid complex Plan of the complex It is located southwest of the pyramid of Khendjer. The pyramid was rediscovered in the 1910‚Äì1911 expedition by Ernest Mackay and Flinders Petrie; in 1929‚Äì1930 Gustave J√©quier conducted a detailed exploration of the pyramid complex. The complex consists in a hypogeum, a barely started superstructure and a wavy enclosure wall; other expected subsidiary structures, such as the cult pyramid, funerary temple, etc., were not found. Remarkably, two uninscribed cap-stones made from black granite were discovered within the site, which seem to have brought there quite early compared to the incomplete superstructure. The pyramid appears to have been planned to be slightly larger than actually built: The base was designed to be a square of per side, adjacent to the base of Khendjer‚Äôs pyramid. Fine Tura limestone bricks were used for the walls of the hypogeum; the same material was also used for the incomplete superstructure foundations, the trench of which was deep and wide. The unique sinusoid-shaped enclosure wall is relatively well preserved. It was made of mudbricks and is thick with foundations deep. At the four corners of the pyramid a few objects belonging to the foundation deposits have been found, but none of the finds bears any name. Hypogeum Isometric view of the hypogeum The hypogeum is remarkable for its size and complexity, and is the largest and most elaborate of all known pyramids dating from the late 12th and 13th dynasties. The passageway changes directions and level several times, and was planned to contain four portcullises, more than any other pyramid from that period. =Entryway= The pyramid entrance is on the east side. A long descending staircase passes through the alcove where the first portcullis was intended to be put. The corridor turns left and continues then turns right, again facing west. At that point two passageways open on the right side of the corridor: The first passage is the entry to a long storage hallway; the second passage is a staircase that again descends level and turns left (facing west). The passage continues west through the second (on the left) and third (on the right) portcullises, each of which involves a level change without stairs, and finally arriving to the last fork, which is a hallway leading to the two sarcophagus chambers. The larger sarcophagus chamber directly ahead (west), and the smaller sarcophagus chamber to the right (north). =Two sarcophagus chambers= The main sarcophagus chamber, with its inverted-V-shaped ceiling, is directly opposite the entrance of the fork-hallway, to the west. It is the larger of the two chambers, and contains a monolithic quartzite block which has a large cavity carved in its center to contain a sarcophagus and a niche for a canopic chest, both unused: Evidently no canopic chest nor sarcophagus were ever placed in the large chamber. The entrance to the second, smaller sarcophagus chamber is on the north side of the fork-hallway, and is laid out as two separate parts. The purpose of the chamber is unclear: It may have been intended for a queen consort, or for the king's ka, a co-regnal sibling of the pharaoh, or maybe simply a false burial chamber intended to confuse grave robbers. The two parts of the second sarcophagus chamber were designed to be separated by a fourth and last portcullis, still open. It is peculiar for having the order of the ‚Äúantechamber‚Äù and the sarcophagus-vault swapped: The sarcophagus-vault is entered before what would customarily be the ‚Äúantechamber‚Äù, which holds the lid of the sarcophagus and would have been sealed off by the wall formed by the portcullis, once in place. This strange layout is also unexplained, perhaps reflecting some unknown reason of religion or tradition. =Plundering= The hypogeum was designed to be virtually impervious to plunderers by several sophisticated expedients, such as direction changes, level changes, trapdoors hidden beneath the pavement, ceiling, and side walls, and the four portcullises, and possibly a decoy burial chamber (if indeed the second sarcophagus chamber was intended as a false chamber, as proposed above). Despite the precautions, robbers managed to make their way into the burial chambers only to find them empty. There are indications that the pyramid was first violated in antiquity and at least another time much later. The second entry was likely during the times of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'm≈´n (9th century CE) who entered the Great Pyramid of Giza. Gustave J√©quier was able to reach the chambers through the corridor and a thieves‚Äô tunnel. Attribution The complex shares many similarities with other complexes, such as the pyramid of Khendjer, the Northern Mazghuna pyramid, and to a lesser extent the pyramid of Ameny Qemau (mainly in having a second sarcophagus). However, none of the objects recovered from the complex provides the name of its owner, although construction management labels were found that refer to regnal years 3 to 5. A fragmentary inscription found within the pyramid reads \\"Weserkha...\\" that might refer to the Golden Horus name Weserkhau of king Djehuti, suggesting that he could have been the pyramid owner. Considering the size, complexity, and quality of various parts of the hypogeum, Rainer Stadelmann argued that the owner should have been an important (or at least ambitious) pharaoh when compared with the standards of the period. J√©quier proposed that the pyramid belonged to a close predecessor or successor of Khendjer such as Wegaf or Imyremeshaw. Ryholt excluded Wegaf due to his too-brief reign compared to the regnal years on the construction labels, and rather proposed Imyremeshaw or his successor Sehetepkare Intef as possible owners. Landua-McCormack suggested that the two sarcophagus chambers might have belonged to two brother pharaohs of the 13th Dynasty, such as the relatively wealthy kings Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV.

Founded in 1983, it was purchased by a subsidiary of Jacuzzi Group Worldwide in 2012 and now operates under the name ThermoSpas Hot Tub Products, Inc. History ThermoSpas was founded in 1983 and began in a 30,000 square foot facility in Shelton, Connecticut. It continued to expand and relocated to a 140,000 square foot manufacturing plant a few years later in Wallingford. ThermoSpas originally sold through hot tub dealers in the mid-1980s. In 1995, the company cut ties with most dealers in favor of a new approach to hot tub sales. The company's business model became unique in the industry. While major hot tub companies sold through independent dealers, ThermoSpas used a direct-to-consumer model and performed everything from the initial site inspection through installation of its tubs. Its best lead system was from infomercials which generated hundreds of thousands of leads for the company. ThermoSpas ran into financial difficulty in 2008-2009 during the United States recession. It became unable to manage every aspect of its business, reporting $2.6 million in assets with almost $18 million in debt, eventually filing bankruptcy. A subsidiary of Jacuzzi Group Worldwide purchased some of the assets of ThermoSpas, giving ThermoSpas the resources and improved infrastructure to continue it use of the direct-to-consumer business model. Although considered a subsidiary of Jacuzzi Group Worldwide, ThermoSpas operates as an independent company officially named ThermoSpas Hot Tub Products, Inc. Since its inception, the ThermoSpas has been known for development and use of technology such as a patented control therapy system that allows each person in a hot tub to have a personalized therapeutic experience in addition to various filtration systems that help purify water used in a hot tub. Products ThermoSpas sells pre-designed hot tubs as well as personally designed hot tubs for personal use. In addition to personal hot tubs, ThermoSpas is known for healing spas and swim spa trainers. It is also attributed as the first to develop a healing spa specifically for arthritis sufferers, a design that they partnered with the Arthritis Foundation to complete.

In the mid-1990s many Ethiopians began moving to the U Street area. Many moved out of Adams Morgan to other areas after rent became increasingly expensive. The campaign to officially designate the U Street area as Little Ethiopia started around 2004. Elizabeth Chacko, the author of \\"Translocality in Washington, D.C. and Addis Ababa,\\" stated that the Ethiopian community wanted the Little Ethiopia in Washington, D.C. because the city is the capital of the United States.Chacko, \\"Translocality in Washington, D.C. and Addis Ababa,\\" p. 169. This campaign was not successful. The author added that at that time, the Ethiopian area in Alexandria, Virginia had a higher concentration of Ethiopians compared to the one in Washington, D.C. In 2004 the Mayor of Washington, D.C. signed the DC Language Access Act, which provided government services in five non-English languages including Amharic.

The ECDC provided loans to 700 persons wishing to own businesses in a nine-year period ending in 2011; these loans totalled almost $4.5 million. The ECDC was established in 1983. The Ethiopian American Constituency Foundation (EACF), which promotes political involvement of the Ethiopian community, was established in 2003. It campaigned for the formal recognition of the Little Ethiopia in Shaw. Ethiocorps, an organization which recruits area Ethiopian Americans to volunteer in Ethiopia, was established in 2004. The Embassy of Ethiopia, Washington, D.C. serves the community. Economy In 2011 the Ethiopian Community Development Council stated that in Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and Maryland there were at least 1,200 businesses owned by ethnic Ethiopians. The area has Ethiopian-owned Ethiopian restaurants and Ethiopian- owned non-Ethiopian restaurants. In 2011 \\"Mama Tutu\\" Belay stated that many Ethiopian restaurants had opened in the Petworth area of Washington DC, Arlington County, Virginia, and the downtown area of Silver Spring, Maryland.

It is mainly funded by the K√∂hler Foundation, which is a member of the Stifterverband, a German business community initiative advocating long-term improvement of the German education and research landscape. The KKC is named after two individuals whose biographies are closely linked, namely, Hans Kilian and Lotte K√∂hler. Hans Kilian (1921-2008), M.D., held the Chair for Social Psychology and Applied Psychoanalysis at the University of Kassel, Germany, from 1971 to 1984. His research interests included psychosomatic medicine, work psychology, cultural-evolutionary anthropology, and the interdisciplinary analysis of psychohistorical and psychosocial developments in individuals and their social environments. One of his specific interests was the lasting psychological effect of the Nazi system on post-war Germany. Lotte K√∂hler (*1925), M.D., received her psychoanalytic training in Munich, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland. As a scientist, she is known for her work on self psychology, early-childhood memory development, and attachment theory. As a businesswoman, she chaired the supervisory board and the shareholders‚Äô meeting at Goebel, LLC, located in Darmstadt, Germany. She ended her business career in 1987 when she established the K√∂hler Foundation, which supports the advancement of the human sciences. From the 1960s until Hans Kilian‚Äôs death, they shared a bond in both the private and scientific domain. As for the latter, they were decisive in introducing Heinz Kohut‚Äôs self psychology to Germany in the 1970s. Following Hans Kilian‚Äôs and Lotte K√∂hler‚Äôs aim to advance psychological and psychoanalytical research through interdisciplinary efforts, the KKC invites input from scholars of manifold fields. In this regard, sociology, anthropology, history, education, and philosophy are considered as important as work in research fields like critical psychology, cultural and postcolonial studies, gender studies, and religious studies.  Scientific Activities  The KKC resulted from a development that began when the Hans-Kilian-Award was given for the first time in 2011. Since then, its activities have increased and focus on the following areas: * Hans-Kilian- Award * Hans Kilian Lecture Series * Hans Kilian symposia and workshops * Hans Kilian fellowships * Hans Kilian student program * Collected Works of Hans Kilian * Kilian-K√∂hler-Archive  References  Press release by the K√∂hler Foundation Category:Multidisciplinary research institutes Category:Social science institutes ","title":"Hans Kilian and Lotte K√∂hler Center"},{"id":"43722212","text":"Hrvoje Kurtoviƒá (born 6 October 1983) is a retired Croatian football midfielder, who last played for Osijek in the Prva HNL.

Based on the fairy tale Cendrillon by Charles Perrault, it is the 12th Disney animated feature film, and was released on February 15, 1950. Directing credits go to Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske and Wilfred Jackson. Songs were written by Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman. Songs in the film include \\"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\\", \\"Bibbidi- Bobbidi-Boo\\", \\"So This Is Love\\", \\"The Work Song\\" and even \\"Sing, Sweet Nightingale\\". With a wicked stepmother and two jealous stepsisters who keep her enslaved and in rags, Cinderella stands no chance of attending the royal ball. When her fairy godmother appears and magically transforms her reality into a dream come true, Cinderella enchants the handsome Prince Charming at the ball, but must face the wrath of her enraged stepmother and sisters when the spell wears off at midnight. =Cinderella II: Dreams Come True= Cinderella II: Dreams Come True is a 2002 American animated romantic musical fantasy film, the first direct-to-video sequel to the 1950 American romantic musical film Cinderella. It was made in 2001 and released on February 26, 2002. It was followed by Cinderella III: A Twist in Time in 2007. It consists of three segments featuring Cinderella planning a party, Jaq the mouse being turned into a human and living as Cinderella's page boy, and one of Cinderella's brutal stepsisters (Anastasia, the redheaded one in a pink dress) reaching her redemption through falling in love with a young baker, a low- class man of whom Lady Tremaine and Drizella do not approve. Estimated to cost $5 million, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True was Walt Disney Pictures' top selling animated sequel that year, grossing approximately $120 million in direct-to-video sales, but the film itself was met with a mainly negative response from fans and critics alike. Cinderella prepares for her first royal ball and tries to help her stepsister find love. =Cinderella III: A Twist in Time= Cinderella III: A Twist in Time is a 2007 American animated musical fantasy film, the second direct-to-video sequel to the 1950 American romantic musical film Cinderella. Canonically it is a continuation of the original Cinderella, rather than Cinderella II: Dreams Come True, though due to its unusual chronological sequencing it acknowledges the events of Cinderella II: Dreams Come True by using some of its characters. The film was released on February 6, 2007, directed by Frank Nissen and features the voices of Jennifer Hale and Susanne Blakeslee. For the UK release of the film, it was simply titled \\"Cinderella: A Twist in Time\\", without mention of it being a sequel. It made its world television premiere on Toon Disney on December 3, 2007. On the first anniversary of Cinderella's marriage to Prince Charming, her stepsister Anastasia finds the Fairy Godmother's wand in the forest. Cinderella's cruel stepmother, Lady Tremaine, uses it to reverse time, making the famous glass slipper fit Anastasia's foot before Cinderella has a chance to try it on. No longer retaining any memory of who Cinderella is, the prince prepares to marry Anastasia. Live-action film Cinderella is an American romantic fantasy film directed by Kenneth Branagh from a screenplay written by Aline Brosh McKenna and Chris Weitz. Produced by David Barron and Simon Kinberg for Walt Disney Pictures, the film is inspired by the folk tale Cinderella by Charles Perrault and the 1950 American romantic musical film of the same name. It stars Lily James as the titular character, Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine, Richard Madden as Prince Charming, Sophie McShera as Drisella Tremaine, Holliday Grainger as Anastasia Tremaine and Helena Bonham Carter as The Fairy Godmother. Principal photography on the film began on September 23, 2013 in London. The film was released on March 13, 2015. After her father unexpectedly dies, young Ella finds herself at the mercy of her cruel stepmother and stepsisters, who reduce her to scullery maid. Despite her circumstances, she refuses to despair. An invitation to a palace ball gives Ella hope that she might reunite with the dashing stranger she met in the woods, but her stepmother prevents her from going. Help arrives in the form of a kindly beggar woman who has a magic touch for ordinary things.

Design and development The low-powered DP.VII was a simple, easily transportable, low-wing monoplane intended to make sports aviation more widely accessible. It had a simple, thick section wing, essentially rectangular in plan apart from blunted, angled tips. This had two main wooden box spars and was braced to the upper fuselage on each side with an inverted V-form pair of struts from the upper fuselage longerons to the spars at about one-third span. Unusually, the one-piece wing structure passed through the deep fuselage above the lower longerons and could be extracted in a few minutes then transported away on a pair of trestles normally stowed inside the DP.VII. The aircraft had long-span ailerons filling about two- thirds of the wing. The simple, flat-sided fuselage was a steel-tube structure with four longerons, linked by welded struts, defining the shape. Internal piano wire bracing stiffened the fuselage, which was fabric-covered. The open cockpit was over the rear wing and was large enough for a passenger to sit behind the pilot, straddling a box seat. Though the power was low, the structure was light and the load/empty weight ratio (0.89) was noted as high. At the time, the installation of the air-cooled Haacke HFM-2 engine was seen as particularly clean, with only the upper cylinders projecting out of the cowling. The DP.VII's mainwheels were mounted on a single axle, conventionally rubber sprung to a cross member attached to the lower fuselage longerons by a V-form pair of struts on each side. Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, V-strut from the cross piece centre to the longerons. There was a sprung tail skid at the rear. The exact date of the DP.VII's first flight is not certain, but the prototype had been well tested by late May 1924 and there were plans to put it into quantity production. At almost the same time, Dietrich-Gobiet were developing the DP.VIIA which, despite the similar designation, was a larger-span, parasol- wing monoplane. It had a similar fuselage and empennage to the DP.VII but a much more powerful engine, a Siemens-Halske Sh 4 five-cylinder radial producing about . This aircraft was on display at the Third International Aero Show at Prague in early June 1924. Few of either type seem to have been produced.

Richmond is the Presidential Chair in Science and Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oregon (UO). She conducts fundamental research to understand the chemistry and physics of complex surfaces and interfaces. These understandings are most relevant to energy production, atmospheric chemistry and remediation of the environment. Throughout her career she has worked to increase the number and success of women scientists in the U.S. and in many developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America. Richmond has served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and she received the 2013 National Medal of Science.  Education  Richmond received her B.S. in chemistry in 1975 from Kansas State University and her Ph.D. in 1980 at University of California, Berkeley, in physical chemistry.  Career  From 1980 to 1985 she was an assistant professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College. Since 1985, Richmond has been at UO, from 1985‚Äì1991 as an associate professor of chemistry, and as a professor since 1991. Until 1995 she was director of the Chemical Physics Institute. From 1998‚Äì2001 she was the Knight Professor of Liberal Arts and Sciences and between 2002‚Äì2013, the Richard M. and Patricia H. Noyes Professor of Chemistry at the UO. Richmond's scientific research encompasses the chemical and physical processes that occur in complex surfaces and boundary layers including the structural and thermodynamic properties of solid / liquid and liquid interfaces. Much of her work has utilised vibrational sum-frequency spectroscopy for studying surfaces and interfaces; her review on the technique has been cited nearly 800 times since it was published. Using these spectroscopic techniques with mixtures of H2O, D2O, and HOD, Richmond has studied the nature of hydrogen bonding surface structures and in the interfacial region. She has also studied how these structures are perturbed by electrolytes like simple sodium halide salts or acids or bases, and by surfactants. In examining the behavior of water at hydrophobic surfaces, Richmond found that weaker dipoles in an organic phase is more effective for orienting individual water molecules near the interface. The interactions at aqueous / hydrophobic interfaces are important for understanding biochemical properties at boundaries such as cell membranes, as is the solvation of charge in such environments. The study of zwitterionic species like amino acids is important for similar reasons. In 1997 Richmond co-founded COACh along with Jeanne E. Pemberton; Richmond is currently its Director. COACh grassroots organization based at the University of Oregon that organizes international conferences and provides career building workshops aimed at increasing the number and success of women scientists in the U.S. and in many developing countries. Over 22,000 women have attended COACh career building workshops to date.

In 2016 she was awarded a Fulbright Scholar fellowship to research with colleagues at the Queensland University of Technology.cfm Public intellectual role On copyright, Aufderheide examines ways in which intellectual property law impacts the production, circulation, and consumption of media. She has argued, often in conjunction with Peter Jaszi, that the U.S. copyright doctrine of fair use is more available than many communities of practice currently make of it. Fair use is linked, in this argument, with free expression. Extensive research with a variety of communities of practice have demonstrated that link, as was documented in Reclaiming Fair Use. With Jaszi, she has coordinated successful efforts in several communities of practice to articulate the best practices of a community on fair use. Reclaiming Fair Use documented that when communities have employed these codes of best practices and, through them, learned about the availability of fair use, their ability to make work more efficiently and effectively has increased, expanding free expression. These results were not anticipated by critics of the position that Aufderheide and Jaszi have taken. Lawrence Lessig for instance has argued that fair use is too undependable to be a reliable balancing feature of copyright, and that encouraging people to use it distracts from the mission to reform copyright law. Jennifer Rothman has argued that codes of best practices could constrain employment of fair use. On media, Aufderheide has focused on both spaces and behaviors that foster exchange of public knowledge with the goal of resolving problems. In this she follows the argumentation of the American pragmatic philosopher John Dewey, who argued that the public exists to the extent people talk it into existence with others. She has analyzed the American institutions of public television, cable access television, and DBS set-aside channels, as well as the evolution of social-issue documentary from earliest days to interactive documentary platforms. Aufderheide has connected these concerns with communities outside academia in a variety of ways. She serves on the boards of the social-issue documentary company Kartemquin Films and the Independent Television Service, a production entity majority-funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. She has consulted with foundations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur and the Ford Foundations. Her research on cable access television was used in a Supreme Court decision that permitted the continued existence of cable access. The Center for Media & Social Impact also showcases strategies and techniques for making impactful social-issue documentaries, through screenings, filmmaker visits, and an annual conference, Media That Matters.

They are being drawn into a bet to prove the presence of ghosts by a rich schoolmate Prosper (Bobby Simha). This leads them to a journey to five different places around the world suspected to be haunted. Namely, events which had unfolded in Japan, Dubai, the mid-sea of the Bay of Bengal, a highway in Andhra Pradesh, and a remote ATM booth in Tamil Nadu. They fail to capture ghosts in camera in all the cases. They are now worried that they would lose the 60 crore prize amount, and Prosper would win. Meanwhile, they learn about a video footage in which a ghost is sighted killing the ATM watchmen. The video footage is in a pen drive owned by Bosskey, the owner of the security company in which the ATM security guard was employed. When he comes to know the huge reward money for a video footage proving existence of ghosts, he demands 50 lakhs for the pen drive. Cherry approaches Prosper to get 50 lakhs. Instead, Prosper tries to take advantage of the situation and behaves indecently with her. Cherry gets annoyed and returns home and narrates the incident to Thamizh and Singaram. That night, Cherry gets a call from her lover Salim (Ajai), and with shock and fear, she utters one word: \\"accident\\". The three friends visit the place and find Salim dying. Before dying, he narrates the incident and records it in his camera.

The discovery of gold saw a boom in population from 800 to 35,000 residents between 1848 and 1850. These immigrants were composed of miners and fortune seekers from a variety of nationalities and cultures, over 95% of whom were young men. \\"Miner's Ball,\\" 1891 etching by Andre Castaigne which portrays a men-only dance during the 1849 California Gold rush These transient and diverse populations thrust into a relatively anarchic environment were less likely to conform to social conventions. For example, with an unbalanced gender ratio, men often assumed roles conventionally assigned to women in social and domestic settings. Cross-gender dress and same-sex dancing were prevalent at city masquerade balls where some men assumed the traditional role of women going so far as to wear female attire. In her study \\"Arresting dress, cross- dressing in 19th-century San Francisco\\", Clare Sears also describes numerous cases of women who donned men's clothing in public spaces for increased social and economic freedom, safety, and gender progressive experimentation. Cross- dressing is still an important part of LGBT culture in the city today. The late 1800s saw a shift in the demographics of the city along with new social and political attitudes. Anti-vice campaigns emerged to target prostitution along with the criminalization of perceived gender transgressions including outlawing cross-dressing in 1863. Cross-dressing laws and public decency laws continued to inform LGBT culture and its interactions with law enforcement well into the 20th century. This political shift resulted in San Francisco's queer culture remerging in bars, nightclubs, and entertainment of the Barbary Coast, removed from policing and control. Through the 1890s to 1907, the Barbary Coast, San Francisco's early red-light district located on Pacific Avenue, featured same-sex prostitution and female impersonators who served male clientele. = 20th century =  Through WWII - in the shadows  Gladys Bentley performed at the lesbian club Mona's in the 1930s Michael Stabile of Out stated that the first \\"notorious\\" gay bar in San Francisco was The Dash, which opened in 1908.\\"12 Bars That Made San Francisco Gay, In Chronological Order \\" (Archive).

Mona's, San Francisco's first lesbian bar, opened on Union Street in 1934, and featured cross-dressing waitresses as well as entertainer Gladys Bentley. Nightclubs with drag shows drew both gay and straight audiences. During World War II, gay night life in San Francisco went through several waves of crackdown and reorganization. From 1942 to 1943, the San Francisco Moral Drive‚Äîconsisting of military patrols‚Äîcarried out a series of raids targeting the gay bars in San Francisco, with the stated aim of protecting servicemen from homosexuals. Chinatown, as one of places where gay visitors gathered, had also been searched several times.

The beat poets who relocated to San Francisco from New York flourished in San Francisco's permissive atmosphere, and some like Allen Ginsberg were openly gay. In these conditions the first homosexual groups were founded, such as the Daughters of Bilitis (founded in San Francisco, it was the first lesbian civil and political rights organization in the United States), and the Mattachine Society, which started in Los Angeles but was headquartered in San Francisco beginning around 1956.

Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the present. New York: Vintage Books. pp. 348. . San Francisco police had agreed not to interfere; however, on the evening of the ball, the police showed up in force and surrounded the California Hall and focused numerous kleig lights on the entrance to the hall. As each of the 600 plus persons entering the ball approached the entrance, the police took their photographs. A number of police vans were parked in plain view near the entrance to the ball. Evander Smith, a lawyer for the groups organizing the ball, and Herb Donaldson tried to stop the police from conducting the fourth \\"inspection\\" of the evening; both were arrested, along with two heterosexual lawyers - Elliott Leighton and Nancy May - who were supporting the rights of the participants to gather at the ball. But twenty-five of the most prominent lawyers in San Francisco joined the defense team for the four lawyers, and the judge directed the jury to find the four not-guilty before the defense had even had a chance to begin their argumentation when the case came to court. This event has been called \\"San Francisco's Stonewall\\" by some historians; the participation of such prominent litigators in the defense of Smith, Donaldson and the other two lawyers marked a turning point in gay rights on the West Coast of the United States. Plaque commemorating Compton's Cafeteria riot Vanguard, an organization of LGBT youth in the low-income Tenderloin district, was created in 1965. It is considered the first Gay Liberation organization in the U.S. In 1966 SIR opened America's first gay and lesbian community center. In 1966, one of the first recorded transgender riots in US history took place. The Compton's Cafeteria Riot occurred in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. The night after the riot, more transgender people, hustlers, Tenderloin street people, and other members of the LGBT community joined in a picket of the cafeteria, which would not allow transgender people back in. The demonstration ended with the newly installed plate-glass windows being smashed again. According to the online encyclopedia glbtq.com, \\"In the aftermath of the riot at Compton's, a network of transgender social, psychological, and medical support services was established, which culminated in 1968 with the creation of the National Transsexual Counseling Unit [NTCU], the first such peer-run support and advocacy organization in the world\\". One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967. Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time. The number of San Francisco gay bars increased in the 1960s.  1970s - Gay liberation, The Castro comes out  In the wake of the Stonewall riots in New York in June 1969, groups in New York, San Francisco and elsewhere became active in 1970 promoting rights for gays. Newspapers were established, and parades were organized in major cities commemorating the anniversary of the riots. These disparate efforts became known collectively as the Gay liberation movement in the United States, and primarily involved gay men and lesbians.

Polk Gulch was a popular gay neighborhood from the 1950s to the 1980s, hosting the original annual Halloween street fair which later moved to the Castro. Folsom Street was the home of the first leather bars, and still hosts the annual leather subculture street fair and food court event, held in September, Folsom Street Fair. In 1977 a large portion of the LGBT community was centered in the upper Market Street and Haight-Ashbury area. The Castro area of San Francisco is most well known as a gay neighborhood. This began in the 1960s and 1970s as LGBT people began moving to the community. It was where Harvey Milk had his camera shop and did much of his organizing in the 1970s. The neighborhood now features permanent rainbow Pride flags, an LGBT History Museum, and a Walk of Fame with the names of notable LGBT people inscribed on the sidewalk.

In November 1977 Harvey Milk was elected as the first openly gay politician in the city of San Francisco; he became a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. The Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club was founded as the San Francisco Gay Democratic Club in 1976 and received its current name in 1978 in honor of Harvey Milk after he was assassinated. This club was a more progressive offshoot of the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club, founded in San Francisco in 1971, the first gay Democratic club of the United States. Harry Britt was president of the club when Milk was assassinated and was appointed by the Mayor Dianne Feinstein to succeed Milk as supervisor. Britt went on to be the second openly gay elected official in San Francisco, as well as the first openly gay official to become the President of the Board of Supervisors, writing and passing domestic partnership legislation. He successfully passed rent control ordinances, was the highest elected gay official in the city during the onset of the AIDS epidemic, and later became a Vice Chair of Democratic Socialists of America. Anne Kronenberg, who was openly lesbian, was Milk's campaign manager during his San Francisco Board of Supervisors campaign, and later worked as his aide while he held that office. In 1978, lesbian Sally Miller Gearhart fought alongside Milk to defeat Proposition 6 (also known as the \\"Briggs Initiative\\" because it was sponsored by John Briggs), which would have banned gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools in California. Milk was murdered on November 27, 1978 in the Moscone‚ÄìMilk assassinations. Riots broke out after the perpetrator, Dan White, received a manslaughter conviction, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Both the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club and the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club raise money during the Alice Pride breakfasts, held each June and attended by the Mayor of San Francisco and other area politicians.

It is most known for the discovery by Christiaan Eijkman that Beriberi was caused by a lack of thiamine in the human body. History Founded as the Geneeskundig Laboratorium, or Medical Laboratory, at Jalan Diponegoro No. 69 in Central Jakarta in 1888, Christiaan Eijkman was stationed there as its first director. During his time there, he discovered that Beriberi, which was commonly believed to be caused by external forces, was caused by a lack of thiamine in the human body. This led to a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for Eijkman in 1929. In 1938, the laboratory was renamed the Eijkman Institute in honor of Eijkman. During World War II, Japanese occupiers accused the center's first Indonesian director, Achmad Mochtar, of poisoning a batch of vaccine that was to be delivered to slave laborers. After Mochtar and his researchers were tortured and interrogated, he made a deal with the Japanese that he would plead guilty if his researchers were released. He was then executed and buried in an unmarked grave. It is possible that Mochtar was a scapegoat for a failed Japanese experiment designed to validate a conjured tetanus toxoid vaccine for their troops.Kevin Baird, \\"War Crimes in Japan-Occupied Indonesia: Unraveling the Persecution of Achmad Mochtar\\", The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol. 14, Issue 1, No. 3, January 1, 2016. During the 1960s, the institute closed due to upheaval in the country and was absorbed into the Cipto Mangunkusomo Hospital. It remained closed for the next thirty years until 1992, when B.J. Habibie, the Minister of Research and Technology, decided to reopen the institute. By 1993, it was fully operational, but ran into further troubles in 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis. In 2004, the institute identified the suicide bomber who blew himself up in front of the Australian Embassy, which drew recognition to the practical benefits of molecular biology. Today, the institute houses one of the few Biosafety Level 3 laboratories in the country, which is equipped with a gas decontamination chamber. Building From the outside, the building has been described as looking like a museum, although the inside has not been renovated in an attempt to keep the building looking as it did when Eijkman was working there. This includes a visitor's lounge which is still furnished with wood and rattan chairs and other furnishings that have not been changed since the opening of the building.

Charles Clement Coe, F.R.G.S., as colleague from 1865. In 1808 he opened a school which he maintained for over thirty years. To him Samuel Parr addressed, 19 December 1819, a noted letter on methods of classical training. His pupils included Sir John Mellor, John Paget and James Thompson. Berry was one of the founders of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society, and of the Leicester Town Museum. As a preacher he dealt simply with topics of common life, in pithy language. His Christology was humanitarian; early in his ministry he had a pulpit controversy on the subject with Robert Hall, then Baptist minister at Haney Lane, Leicester, with whom he maintained a long friendship. He died 4 May 1877 in the house of his son-in-law, near Liverpool. Works Berry published several sermons, including: * The Duty of National Thanksgiving, 1812. * Funeral Sermon for Queen Caroline, 1821. * Remarks on Popery and the present Anti-papal Agitation, 1851.

She was brought up in a strict Methodist family, and remained at home until she was forty attending her mother, who died in 1906. Chown then embarked on a life of travel and involvement in many reform causes. She was an original and iconoclastic thinker, and became one of the leading social feminists of her day. She is best known for her 1921 book The Stairway in which she recounts her life and growing freedom after 1906. Early years Alice Amelia Chown was born in Kingston, Province of Canada on 3 February 1866. Her family was Methodist. Her relatives included doctors, lawyers and senior clergymen such as S.D. Chown, her uncle. She had six brothers in her well-to-do family. Her mother, Amelia, insisted that Alice received an equal education to her brothers. Alice studied political science and economics at Queen's University, and graduated with a BA in 1887. Her political science teacher, professor Shortt, tried to convince her that socialism was dangerous. In 1899 Chown was secretary of the Kingston Charity Organization Society, which believed in scientific philanthropy, and spoke on this subject at the National Council of Women of Canada annual meeting. Her speech was printed as an article in the Methodist Christian Guardian. She stayed at home until she was forty, when her profoundly religious mother died in 1906. After this she started to travel and work on social reforms. Her decision to take advantage of her freedom at this age was somewhat alarming to the conservative middle-class society of Kingston. Pre-war activities Chown supported women's trade unions, women's suffrage and the League of Nations. In 1910 she took her niece Edith Georgina Chown, whose father had just died, on a visit to England, Belgium and France. In London they saw the funeral of King Edward VII, visited Dr Barnado's Homes, listened to the feminist Christabel Pankhurst and represented Canada in a suffragist demonstration. A brilliant and controversial iconoclast overflowing with ideas, Alice Chown became the best known of the first wave of social feminists in Canada. She was an admirer of the views of Edward Carpenter on love and sex. She rejected the constraining clothes of the period, and adopted loose tunics and bare feet. She tried, without success, to introduce the theories of Sigmund Freud to the middle-class supporters of the suffrage movement in Toronto. Chown became field secretary of the Canadian Household Economic Association. Chown believed that women played a valuable role in the home, but disliked the idea of \\"separate spheres\\" because that would cause women to be judged only as homemakers. She wanted women to have a broader education so they could develop all of their intellectual talents. She agreed that the domestic science schools that Adelaide Hoodless of the Women's Institutes wanted to institute in rural Ontario would have value, but was concerned that with their narrow curriculum women would become ghettoized. In 1911 Chown investigated the training of Methodist deaconesses, and The Christian Guardian was persuaded to publish the resulting derisive report. She surmised that the real object of the training was, \\"to furnish nice little satellites for Methodist ministers, women who will clasp their hands in admiration at the greater knowledge of the pastor... It seemed to me that the course of study was aptly framed to fill Ruskin's ideal education of women, the ability to appreciate other people's learning, not to be competent oneself.\\" The article caused a strong reaction from other readers of the paper. The Reverend Bartle Bull said deaconesses did not need \\"abstract sociological theories.\\" Chown wrote other articles along the same lines. She was in contact with the Hull House in Chicago, and like its founders wanted to improve working class conditions. Her main criticism of the Deaconess society was that it failed to address the underlying causes of poverty. In 1912 Chown helped organize support for strikers at Eaton's department store in Toronto. She saw the picketers being mishandled, joined them and was herself pushed into a police wagon. The strikers asked Chown to use her position in society to persuade the Toronto papers to discuss the strike, which they were reluctant to do for fear of losing advertising revenue. Chown had some difficulty getting overt support for the strike from the Toronto Women's Suffrage Society, who did not want to be damaged by association with an unpopular cause. The unpopularity of the strike among Chown's acquaintances was partly because the great majority of the strikers were Jewish. Canadian feminists, like many others in Canada, disliked these recent immigrants. Chown was a founding member of the Toronto Equal Franchise League in 1912. Later career Alice Chown in her later years. Photo taken in the 1940s. From the 1989 re-issue of The Staircase. Chown was a committed pacifist during World War I (1914‚Äì18). Chown said that non-resistance \\"is only possible to men and women whose faith in this being a spiritual universe is strong.\\" She thought that pacifists \\"have glimpsed the coming world ideal.\\" At the Women's International Conference at The Hague in 1915, Chown \\"contributed to the merging of pacifist and suffragette ideas in a program denouncing militarism, autocracy, secret treaties, and imperialism while calling for a new international order based on compulsory arbitrarion, universal disarmament, freedom of the seas, and a league of democratic nations.\\" In the same year, she was a co-founder with Laura Hughes and Elsie Charlton of the Canadian Women's Peace Party. Her outspoken views were to bring her notoriety. She was hostile to the church, and as a pacifist was critical of the attitude of her cousin Samuel Dwight Chown, a Methodist minister and army chaplain during the war. Chown's pacifism caused conflict with other Canadian feminist leaders. In 1917 she moved to the United States, where she taught at a trade union college for the next ten years. Later she traveled in Europe and Russia. Chown founded the Women's League of Nations Association in 1930, dedicated to education in pacifism. She organized teas at which Jews and gentiles could meet. She wrote a column for the United Church Observer. In 1945 she was elected honorary president of Toronto's United Nations Society. Alice Amelia Chown died in Toronto on 2 March 1949. Despite being unconventional, in some ways Chown was a typical late Victorian social reformer. Contrasting her views to those of her mother, she wrote, \\"Her faith was in a Supreme Being who existed perfect, complete; mine in a life force, present in every man, which must grow and develop.\\" Writings Chown published her journal The Stairway in 1921, based on her diaries between 1906 and 1920, which tells of her experiences in terms of a series of steps leading to ever greater freedom. The book gives her opinions on many subjects including the settlement and co-operative movements, trade unionism, female suffrage, dress reform and sexual freedom. She wrote on the rights on women to higher education, education in home economics, urban improvement, universal brotherhood and world peace.

Rogers, who was then president of the Malleable Iron Range Company, built the 6 story hotel to cater to the salesmen that frequently visited the city. Additional floor space on the sixth level was added in 1930. This building was operated as a hotel by his daughter, Ann Rogers-Pfieffer until 1987.Wisconsin State Journal, Madison Newspapers Inc., March 26, 1987, Section 4, Page 1 The facilities in the building include a large kitchen and dining room on the first level. This dining room was operated part-time as a restaurant and was available for events like meetings and banquets. Other facilities included a coffee shop, a drug store, and a barber and a beauty shop. A writing room/parlor was provided for female guests, while male guests could enjoy a bar that discreetly served patrons even during the years of prohibition. In 1987 a business partnership purchased the building. Extensive remodeling and updating was done at that time. Some of the hotel style rooms were combined into full apartments. Reception areas were furnished with antiques and new carpet in a style similar to the originals was installed. Bronze chandeliers and sconces with Tiffany style glass shades replaced fluorescent fixtures on the main floor. The entire building was updated and upgraded to follow the original style of the building as much as possible. There are currently 41 apartments and 20 sleeping rooms. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The building is currently operated as an apartment building with monthly rates with a mix of full apartments and sleeping rooms.

After purchasing the Uptown Theater in 2000, real estate developer George Altamura announced in 2003 that he had partnered with several investors including Francis Ford Coppola in a project to restore the building as a live entertainment venue. As restoration of the interior took place, several coats of paint were removed from the ceiling revealing an original Greco-Roman mural. Artists were brought in to restore the artwork to original form.

October 25, 2013) was a journalist and artist known for her travel writing and restoration of the Maison du Prieur√© in Romainm√¥tier, a national heritage site in Switzerland. She is also known for promoting utopian visions in her writing as well as in a textile art project called Histoires des villes (History of Cities). Life Von Arx was born in a town called Niederg√∂sgen (Kt. Solothurn) near Zurich, Switzerland. In 1933 her family moved to Zurich, where she attended school including graduating from a trade school for women in 1947. She was restless and curious by nature and according to her daughter, fascinated by stories, whether they be spoken, written or depicted pictorially. From 1952 to 1953 she studied drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna where she met Friedrich Hundertwasser who became a mentor and longtime friend. Hundertwasser told her to paint what she feared to make it more tolerable. She left the academy at age 25 to travel the world, drawing, painting, translating and even singing Swiss folk songs in the streets to earn money to live and move on to the next place. In the end she circled the globe in the northern hemisphere. As a travel writer, she was sent to the Tonga Islands in the Pacific. Here she met journalist and photographer Freddy Drilhon, to whom she was married until his death in 1976. The couple had one daughter, Fr√©deriqu√© Drilhon von Arx, born in 1958. During a family vacation in 1959, the couple found a medieval building called the Maison du Prieur√© (Priory House), located in the small town of Romainm√¥tier in Switzerland. At the time, it was in danger of being demolished by local authorities, but Katharina fell in love with it and the couple bought it to settle down and raise their child. Despite being over fifteen centuries old and visited by kings, it had become forgotten and was in decrepit condition. Katharina worked to save the building, writing about, promoting its historical value and founding a private association dedicated to saving it. It took thirty years to raise the money and restore the building and today it is a national monument. She lived in the house for over fifty years, until her death in 2013 at age 85. Writing career Although she trained as a visual artist, Von Arx‚Äôs career was focused on writing. This began during her first travels in the early 1950s, writing articles about her experiences during. She continued after she returned to Switzerland, writing books and other texts based on her travels for children and adults. This led to work as a journalist, which earned her opportunities for further travel to write and draw what she saw. From 1956 to 1958, she was on a long-term assignment in the Tonga Islands, where she met husband Freddy Drilhon, which whom she also collaborated professionally until his death in 1976. She continued to write and illustrate periodicals and books for the rest of her life, which included fictional work as well. The latter mostly focused on alternative universes and utopian idea as well as stories based on the history of the Priory House. Her fictional writing mostly focused on alternative universes and how to make the world better. During her career she depicted utopian worlds both in words and pictures with the aim of making a better reality. Her books describe her travels and adventures as well as the history of the Priory House. In addition to her work with the building she also gave workshops on writing, printing, bookbinding and paper making. Her work won recognitions such as the Kulturpreis des Kantons Solothurn (1975), F√∂rderpreis Olten (1976), the Werkbeitrag der Goethe-Stiftung, Z√ºrich (1976) and the Werkbeitr√§ge von Bund, Kt.Solothurn, Stiftungen, Unternehmen 1972-1987.

Her daughter states that she was terrified of the urban sprawl of the twentieth century although she admired the creativity of man and especially architecture. At age fifteen, she began the first piece, with a utopian image of her hometown. During her life, she invited others to participate, with the collection gaining pieces with images of various parts of the world such as New York, Mexico and the Middle East, all created by local hands. At the time of her death the collection contained twenty pieces, done in a variety of fabrics, a compilation that the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City calls ‚Äúsui generis‚Äù unique in its composition and theme.

On July 25, the Yankees promoted Goody to the major leagues. The Yankees optioned Goody back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on July 28, without having made any major league appearances. The Yankees recalled him on July 30 due to an injury to Michael Pineda. He made his major league debut that day. On December 15, 2016, Goody was designated for assignment by the Yankees. =Cleveland Indians= The Yankees subsequently traded Goody to the Cleveland Indians on December 20, 2016, in exchange for either a player to be named later or cash considerations. In 2017, Goody had his best year yet as a reliable reliever, making 56 appearances, logging a 2.80 ERA, and striking out 72 batters in 54 2/3 innings. On October 3, it was announced that he would not be included on the Indians' 25-man roster for the ALDS. In 2019, Goody appeared in 39 games, striking out 50 in innings. Goody was designated for assignment on November 20, 2019. =Texas Rangers= On November 26, 2019, Goody was claimed off of release waivers by the Texas Rangers. As Goody had more than three years of service time, he had the option to accept the assignment or refuse and become a free agent. On December 2, Goody accepted the Rangers claim and was added to their roster.

Biography Chase was born to parents Clark Chase (b. August 22, 1770) and Phebe Mason. Chase had two older siblings, Durfee and Mason, and seven younger siblings: Sarah \\"Sally\\", Edmund, Purley, Lucinda, Henry, Abel D., and Asa S. Chase married Malissa Sanders Sounders. The couple had two children: Luther M. and Clark S. Chase was a carpenter and lay Methodist minister. Chase died in Palmyra, New York, on March 10, 1871. Role in Early Mormonism Chase engaged in the practice of treasure hunting or \\"money digging\\". Neighbors, such as physician John Stafford, recalled that Chase's sister Sally used a seer stone to locate treasure. Chase lived \\"over the hill to the East\\" of the Smiths in Palmyra. In 1833, Chase swore an affidavit that was published in the book Mormonism Unvailed by E. D. Howe. > I became acquainted with the Smith family, known as the authors of the > Mormon Bible, in the year 1820. At that time, they were engaged in the money > digging business, which they followed until the latter part of the season of > 1827. =Seer stone discovery and dispute= Chase relates the story of the 1822 discovery of Joseph Smith's seer stone, which was \\"chocolate-colored and about the size of an egg\\": > In the year 1822, I was engaged in digging a well. I employed Alvin and > Joseph Smith .... We discovered a singularly appearing stone .... Joseph put > it into his hat, and then his face into the top of his hat. > After obtaining the stone, he began to publish abroad what wonders he could > discover by looking in it .... I ordered the stone to be returned to me > again. He had it in his possession about two years. > Some time in 1825, Hiram came to me, and wished to borrow the same stone > .... I told him if he would pledge me his word and honor, that I should have > it when called for, he might take it; Chase describes a dispute over the ownership of the stone: > In the fall of 1826, a friend called upon me and wished to see that stone > .... On going to Smith's, and asking him for the stone, he said, \\"you cannot > have it;\\" I told him it belonged to me, repeated to him the promise he made > me, at the time of obtaining the stone: upon which he faced me with a > malignant look and said, \\"I don't care who in the Devil it belongs to, you > shall not have it.\\" As late as 1830, Chase was still trying to recover the stone.\\"In April, 1830, I again asked Hiram [sic] for the stone which he had borrowed of me; he told me I should not have it, for Joseph made use of it in translating his Bible. I reminded him of his promise, and that he had pledged his honor to return it; but he gave me the lie, saying the stone was not mine nor never was.\\" =Early story of gold plates= Chase records hearing an early version of Smith's golden plates story from Joseph Smith, Sr.: > In the month of June, 1827, Joseph Smith, Sen., related to me the following > story: \\"That some years ago, a spirit had appeared to Joseph his son, in a > vision, and informed him that in a certain place there was a record on > plates of gold, and that he was the person that must obtain them, and this > he must do in the following manner: On the 22d of September, he must repair > to the place where was deposited this manuscript, dressed in black clothes, > and riding a black horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a > certain name, and after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither > lay it down nor look behind him. They accordingly fitted out Joseph with a > suit of black clothes and borrowed a black horse. He repaired to the place > of deposit and demanded the book, which was in a stone box, unsealed, and so > near the top of the ground that he could see one end of it, and raising it > up, took out the book of gold; but fearing some one might discover where he > got it, he laid it down to place back the top stone, as he found it; and > turning round, to his surprise there was no book in sight. He again opened > the box, and in it saw the book, and attempted to take it out, but was > hindered. He saw in the box something like a toad, which soon assumed the > appearance of a man, and struck him on the side of his head. ‚Äî Not being > discouraged at trifles, he again stooped down and strove to take the book, > when the spirit struck him again, and knocked him three or four rods, and > hurt him prodigiously. After recovering from his fright, he enquired why he > could not obtain the plates; to which the spirit made reply, because you > have not obeyed your orders. He then enquired when he could have them, and > was answered thus: come one year from this day, and bring with you your > oldest brother, and you shall have them. This spirit, he said was the spirit > of the prophet who wrote this book, and who was sent to Joseph Smith, to > make known these things to him. Before the expiration of the year, his > oldest brother died; which the old man said was an accidental providence! > \\"Joseph went one year from that day, to demand the book, and the spirit > enquired for his brother, and he said that he was dead. The spirit then > commanded him to come again, in just one year, and bring a man with him. On > asking who might be the man, he was answered that he would know him when he > saw him.\\" =Role of Samuel T. Lawrence= According to Chase, Joseph Smith collaborated with seer Samuel T. Lawrence. Chase reported that \\"Joseph believed that one Samuel T. Lawrence was the man alluded to by the spirit, and went with him to a singular looking hill, in Manchester, and [showed] him where the treasure was.\\" Lawrence who was able to \\"see\\" not only the gold plates but also \\"saw\\" the pair of spectacles, which in Mormonism would later be identified with the biblical Urim and Thummim. Chase wrote: > Lawrence asked him if he had ever discovered any thing with the plates of > gold; he said no: he then asked him to look in his stone, to see if there > was any thing with them. He looked, and said there was nothing; he told him > to look again, and see if there was not a large pair of specks with the > plates; he looked and soon saw a pair of spectacles, the same with which > Joseph says he translated the Book of Mormon. Lawrence reportedly warned Smith that \\"it would not be prudent to let these plates be seen for about two years\\". Lawrence reported that Smith later \\"altered his mind, and said L. was not the right man, nor had he told him the right place.\\" Chase described how \\"in the fall of 1826, [Smith] wanted to go to Pennsylvania to be married\\". He reportedly attempted to enlist Lawrence in \\"a very rich mine of silver\\" on \\"the bank of the Susquehannah River\\". =Stowel diggings= Chase describes the diggings on the property of Josiah Stowell: > Now, being still destitute of money, he set his wits at work, how he should > get back to Manchester, his place of residence; he hit upon the following > plan, which succeeded very well. He went to an honest old Dutchman, by the > name of Stowel, and told him that he had discovered on the bank of Black > River, in the village of Watertown, Jefferson County, N.Y. a cave, in which > he had found a bar of gold, as big as his leg, and about three or four feet > long. --That he could not get it out alone, on account of its being fast at > one end; and if he would move him to Manchester, N.Y. they would go > together, and take a chisel and mallet, and get it, and Stowel should share > the prize with him. Stowel moved him. > A short time after their arrival at Manchester, Stowel reminded Joseph of > his promise; but he calmly replied, that he would not go, because his wife > was now among strangers, and would be very lonesome if he went away. Mr. > Stowel was then obliged to return without any gold, and with less money than > he came. =Chest requested= Chased described Smith's request for a chest, writing: > In the fore part of September, (I believe, ) 1827, the Prophet requested me > to make him a chest, informing me that he designed to move back to > Pennsylvania, and expecting soon to get his gold book, he wanted a chest to > lock it up, giving me to understand at the same time, that if I would make > the chest he would give me a share in the book. I told him my business was > such that I could not make it: but if he would bring the book to me, I would > lock it up for him. He said that would not do, as he was commanded to keep > it two years, without letting it come to the eye of any one but himself. > This commandment, however, he did not keep, for in less than two years, > twelve men said they had seen it. I told him to get it and convince me of > its existence, and I would make him a chest; but he said, that would not do, > as he must have a chest to lock the book in, as soon as he took it out of > the ground. I saw him a few days after, when he told me that I must make the > chest. I told him plainly that I could not, upon which he told me that I > could have no share in the book. =Chase attempts to obtain the plates= Although Chase's affidavit makes no mention of it, Lucy Mack Smith recalled that Chase and others attempted to obtain the Golden Plates themselves. Lucy wrote: \\"10 or 12 men were clubbed together with one Willard Chase, a Methodist class leader at their head, and what was most ridiculous they had sent for a conjuror to come 60 miles to divine the place where the record was deposited\\". =Plates discovered= Chase relates the second-hand story about the discovery of the plates: > A few weeks after this conversation, he came to my house, and related the > following story: That on the 22d of September, he arose early in the > morning, and took a one horse wagon, of some one that had stayed over night > at their house, without leave or license; and, together with his wife, > repaired to the hill which contained the book. He left his wife in the > wagon, by the road, and went alone to the hill, a distance of thirty or > forty rods from the road; he said he then took the book out of the ground > and hid it in a tree top, and returned home. He then went to the town of > Macedon to work. After about ten days, it having been suggested that some > one had got his book, his wife went after him; he hired a horse, and went > home in the afternoon, staid long enough to drink one cup of tea, and then > went for his book, found it safe, took off his frock, wrapt it round it, put > it under his arm and run all the way home, a distance of about two miles. He > said he should think it would weigh sixty pounds, and was sure it would > weigh forty. On his return home, he said he was attacked by two men in the > woods, and knocked them both down and made his escape, arrived safe and > secured his treasure. -- He then observed that if it had not been for that > stone, (which he acknowledged belonged to me, ) he would not have obtained > the book. A few days afterwards, he told one of my neighbors that he had not > got any such book, nor never had such an one; but that he had told the story > to deceive the d---d fool, (meaning me, ) to get him to make a chest. =Martin Harris= Chase recalls that Smith \\"met one day in the streets of Palmyra, a rich man, whose name was Martin Harris, and addressed him thus; 'I have a commandment from God to ask the first man I meet in the street to give me fifty dollars, to assist me in doing the work of the Lord by translating the Golden Bible.'\\". Chase recalls that Harris \\"reported that the Prophet's wife ... would be delivered of a male child that would be able when two years old to translate the Gold Bible.\\" =Abel D. Chase= In 1879, Chase's brother Abel Chase gave a sworn statement re-asserting claims Willard had made and asserting that the 1833 affidavit was genuine. Inspiration for the Salamander Letter The Chase Affidavit was a source of inspiration for the Salamander letter, a 20th-century forgery by Mark Hofmann. The Chase Affidavit describes \\"something like a toad\\", which was used as the source for Hofmann's \\"white salamander\\".
