Ajmera High School or the Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School was founded in 1928. The Secondary School was founded in 1958 while the Higher Secondary School was founded in 1960. Later, the BES College was founded in 1966 by the Gujarati Society, Calcutta, which grew out of this school.The Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College, Kolkata. The Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School Indias Schools Both the school and college were started by a privately owned trust started by a Gujarati businessman living in Kolkata and even the land on which the school and college stands was donated by a few generous Gujarati businessman. The fund for construction of school building was donated by a gentleman after whom the school was named, J. J. Ajmera High School. The original purpose of the founders was to give their wards an education in Gujarati, so that they learn writing and speaking in their mother tongue and till almost a decade ago, the admission to school was restricted to only Gujarati speaking people, as per original rules of the trust. Since the beginning of the school in 1928 till 2001, the medium of study till class V was totally in Gujarati and from VI onwards in English and the second language was Gujarati. Bengali was taught as a subject only for two years Class V and VI. The school was at that time affiliated to WB Board till the year 2001 and students had to appear for Madhyamik examinations for passing out. Present day However, since, 2002, the school is now open to the entire community and the medium of teaching is English; the second language offered has been changed to Hindi or Bengali. The teaching of the Gujarati language has been completely stopped. The School is a part of Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society, which also operates one of the most popular colleges in Kolkata. The school is now affiliated to the ICSE Board, New Delhi and offers education right from primary to higher secondary, after which their students can select the stream for further studies in arts, science, commerce or fashion, which are offered by the Bhawanipur Education Society College, run by the same trust.The Bhawanipur Gujrati Education Society is among the few institutes that look into education in totality. The school also has a Computer training Centre, which is a joint venture with Aptech. Notable alumni *Dilip Doshi - noted spin bowler *Dilip Sanghvi - founder Sun Pharma, one of richest man in India.

He began to search Nigamananda and finally met him in Nilachala Kutir Puri on 20 March 1930, Thursday. At that time he was only seventeen years old and a student of class IX in Puri district School. On first meeting he was overwhelmed by his appearance and realised Nigamananda as Ishwar. Since that day, he became a regular visitor to Nilachala Kutir for his darshan. He used to note down guru Nigamananda's sayings(upadesh), later he published these \\"upadesh\\"(gospels)in books like Nilachala Vani and Nigama Upadesh.

Rawandi was from a scholarly family from Rawand near Kashan, and studied Hanafi fiqh in Hamadhan from 1174 to 1184. As a calligrapher, Rawandi was brought to court to craft a Quran for Toghrul III and gained the sultan's favor. After Toghrul's incarceration, Rawandi gained the patronage of Shihab al-Din al-Kashani, who urged him to write the Rahat al-sudur. Rawandi had intended to dedicate his book to S√ºleymanshah II, but dedicated it to Kaykhusraw I, following the latter's accession as Sultan of Rum. Later the Rahat al-sudur was translated into Turkish during the reign of Murad II.

Early career Bukharbaeva began her career reporting for the France-based Agence France Presse (AFP) and the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR). With these agencies, Bukharbaeva covered topics including repression of Islamic activists, police torture, and state sponsorship of harassment and violence against human rights activists and journalists. Her stories on these topics proved unwelcome to the Uzbek government, which soon attempted to restrict her ability to report. In 2002, the government refused to renew her accreditation with the IWPR, and in 2003, her AFP accreditation renewal was also refused. She continued to work at the IWPR nonetheless, becoming its country director for Uzbekistan. According to Bukharbaeva, the organization's office remained under surveillance by an unmarked government car throughout most of 2004 and 2005. Andijan Massacre and aftermath In May 2005, the city of Andijan saw several weeks of protests over the controversial trials of 23 businessmen accused of Islamic extremism. Following weeks of peaceful demonstrations, a group of masked gunmen attacked the jail where the men were being held on the night of 12 May, freeing them as well as protesters who had been arrested the day before. On 13 May, tens of thousands of protesters blockaded the roads, taking control of the city center. A small percentage of them were armed. Bukharbaeva spent the day reporting live from Bobur Square for CNN, BBC News, and other international agencies. At 1800 local time, security forces massed for an assault, and soldiers began firing on the crowd of protesters from armored personnel carriers. Bukharbaeva later described the massacre in a story for the Committee to Protect Journalists: > Without warning, the soldiers opened fire into the crowd. Bodies fell like > mown hay, row upon row. People in the center of the square ran in all > directions, but soldiers had blocked off side streets. A helicopter > clattered overhead, pointing out those trying to escape to the troops below. > I don't know how I escaped. I just ran. \\"They think we are just dirt,\\" a > woman cried to me. When Bukharbaeva reached safety, she discovered that a bullet had passed through her backpack, leaving a hole in her press card and her Che Guevara notebook. Bukharbaeva subsequently conducted interviews with other eyewitnesses, who confirmed that soldiers were executing the injured who had been unable to flee the Square. The bodies of women and children were reportedly being removed from public view and concealed by authorities. The following morning, she attempted to return to the square with Reuters correspondent Shamil Baygin. However, they were intercepted by armed men who took them to the local police station. After two hours, Bukharbaeva and Baygin were released with an order to leave the city. On 25 May, twelve days after the massacre, the government newspaper Pravda Vostoka accused Bukharbaeva and IWPR of instigating the Andijan violence. The article recommended that their pictures be shown on television \\"to warn citizens against them\\". Amnesty International subsequently issued an appeal on behalf of Bukharbaeva, Baygin, and numerous other journalists. In September, the government formally charged Bukharbaeva and other journalists who had reported on the massacre with providing \\"informational support to terrorism\\". Exile Bukharbaeva then spent some time in Kyrgyzstan, first in a refugee camp and later in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, where she was received as a hero by the opposition community. However, she soon moved on to the US for fear that Uzbek security forces might attempt to kidnap her and return her to Uzbekistan for a show trial. She then received a Fulbright Award to pursue a Master's in journalism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. While in the US, she also testified before the Helsinki Commission of the US Congress about her experiences on the day of the massacre. In 2008, three years after Andijan, she wrote an editorial in the New York Times accusing Western nations of having already forgotten the massacre by beginning to normalize relations with Uzbekistan. Bukharbaeva worked as the editor-in-chief for the Uzbek news website uznews.net. The website was blocked within Uzbekistan by state authorities for several years. In 2014, Bukharbaeva's personal email account was hacked and names of her contributors from Uzbekistan were revealed. That forced her to close the website down. In 2016, she started a new regional news service Centre1.com. In 2007, Bukharbaeva served as a founder and chairwoman of the Real Union of Journalists of Uzbekistan. Recognition In 2005, Bukharbaeva won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. The award citation recognized the dangers she faced in her reporting and stated that she had earned \\"a reputation as one of Central Asia's most outspoken journalists\\". In 2011, Newsweek recognized her as \\"one of ten female journalists that risked their lives\\" in pursuit of a story, stating that \\"her reporting on Uzbekistan's authoritarianism led to her being denounced as a traitor\\". Personal life Bukharbaeva is married to a German journalist, Marcus Bensmann, who works for the Swiss daily newspaper Neue Zurcher Zeitung. Bensmann, Bukharbaeva's boyfriend at the time, was also present at the Andijan massacre and was also subsequently labeled a terrorist by the Uzbek government. They currently live in D√ºsseldorf, Germany.

It borders Hammond and East Chicago to the west, and the Gary neighborhoods of Ambridge Mann to the east and Westside to the south. The borders are defined by the Indiana Toll Road on the north, Chase Street on the east, the Norfolk Southern railway on the south and Cline Avenue on the west. As of 2000, Brunswick had a population of 4,442 people, which was 84.6% African-American and 7.7% white. Like many Gary neighborhoods, Brunswick was a segregated white community until the early 1970s, when massive white flight occurred. As of 2000, the neighborhood's housing stock had a 90% occupancy rate and a 68% owner-occupancy rate. It was dominated by single-family homes, with 10% consisting of multi-family dwellings. The neighborhood is the site of a major shopping plaza, with additional commercial development clustered along U.S. 20. There are two private elementary schools, West Gary Lighthouse and Aspire Charter Academy, and one public elementary school, Brunswick Elementary. Brunswick was formerly served by its own post office. However, the Brunswick Station post office was closed in February 2011, and its operations were merged into those of the post office in Tolleston. Brunswick is served by its own branch of the Gary Public Library, which was established in 1959 but only moved into a dedicated space in 2003. Transportation connections in Brunswick include rail, highway, and air. The Gary/Chicago International Airport is located directly north of the neighborhood, and the neighborhood is served by the Clark Road station on the South Shore Line. The Cline Avenue expressway runs just west of Brunswick, and also affords access to the Indiana Toll Road which runs north of the neighborhood. At surface level, the neighborhood is traversed by U.S. 20, and is served by the buses of the Gary Public Transportation Corporation. Remnant areas of dune and swale habitat exist in Brunswick. Examples include the 110-acre Ivanhoe nature preserve operated by the Nature Conservancy, and the Clark and Pine Nature Preserve operated by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, which has the highest concentration of rare and endangered species of any Indiana nature preserve. The neighborhood is home to a 49-acre city park, Brunswick Park, which also incorporates areas of remnant dune and swale. The sewage treatment plant of the Gary Sanitary District is located in Brunswick, near the Grand Calumet River.

Nixon on December 18, 1971. The act covered the management, protection and study of \\"unbranded and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands in the United States.\\" By the 1900s, feral horse populations were in decline, and there was concern that the horses were destroying land and resources wanted by ranching and hunting interests. Pressure on federal agencies from the 1930s on led to a series of policies which severely reduced herd numbers. By the 1950s, modern practices for capturing horses came to the attention of individuals such as Velma Bronn Johnston, also known as \\"Wild Horse Annie,\\" who felt the measures were extreme and cruel. Their activism resulted in the Hunting Wild Horses and Burros on Public Lands Act in 1959. However, the 1959 Act did not resolve all the advocate's concerns, leading to the passage of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service manage these herds. Although the BLM struggled to implement adequate herd management in many areas, in 1973 they began a successful program for rounding up excess numbers, and adopting out these captured horses and burros to private owners. This remains the primary method of removing excess horses and burros from managed land, though in recent years the adoption rate has not kept up with the removal rate, and most horses are currently diverted to long-term holding facilities. Administrative challenges to BLM's management and implementation of the act have been made to the Department of the Interior's Board of Land Appeals. The act has also been challenged in court. Objections have been varied, focusing on constitutionality, and legal status of the animals, but the Act has been upheld in all instances, including Kleppe v. New Mexico, before the United States Supreme Court. Charges have also been made that the BLM has turned a blind eye to the practice of private investors adopting feral horses for the purposes of slaughter, and courts have determined that the BLM may not ignore the intent of adopters. Congress has taken several actions that affect the act by including provisions in other bills. These provisions have addressed the manner in which horses may be rounded up and the method by which horses may be offered for sale or adoption. Contents The act provides specific protections to \\"all unbranded and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands of the United States,\\" Sec. (2)(b) and makes it a crime for anyone to harass or kill these animals on federal land. It requires the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals. Beginning with its enactment, it required studies of the habits and habitats of free-ranging horses and burros, permitting public land to be set aside for their use.Naughton, James M. \\"President Signs Bill to Protect Wild Horses on Federal Lands.\\" New York Times. December 18, 1971.GAO-09-77, p. 13 In addition, the act required that these horses and burros be protected as \\"living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West\\", The BLM was tasked with identification of the areas where free-roaming horses and burros were found; there was no specific amount of acreage set aside, and the Act required management plans to \\"maintain a thriving natural ecological balance among wild horse populations, wildlife, livestock, and vegetation and to protect the range from the deterioration associated with overpopulation.\\"Iraola, p. 1056. Although wild horse ranges were principally for the protection of the horses, the land was required to be maintained for multiple use. The BLM was also permitted to close public land to livestock grazing to protect wild horse and burro habitat. History Free-roaming horses in Utah Although the Act uses the technical language \\"wild free-roaming\\" to describe the horses and burros protected under the Act, the BLM notes that \\"today's American wild horses should not be considered 'native'.\\" All protected animals descend from domesticated horses and burros brought to the Americas beginning in the 1500s. Some escaped to the wild while others were released, and over the ensuing centuries, these feral animals adapted to the Western range. Due to the Act, the BLM manages horses and burros as \\"wild\\" regardless of their native or non- native status. Free-roaming horses could once be found throughout much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered as many as two million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are speculative. Horse numbers were in decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed with them for resources.Lynghaug, p. 104. Ranchers shot horses to leave more grazing land for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter. By the end of the 1920s, free- roaming horses mostly lived on General Land Office (GLO)-administered lands and National Forest rangelands in 11 Western States. Their genetic origins were diverse, reflecting the American westward expansion from the mid-1800s on.Mustang Country, pp. 2-3 Their bloodlines included horses of Spanish-Barb descent as well as draft and saddle horses turned loose on the open range.Mustang Country, p. 4 Management of horses running on the range was initially left to Mustangers and local ranchers, but in 1934, the Taylor Grazing Act (TGA) established the United States Grazing Service (Grazing Service) to manage livestock grazing on public lands. The TGA authorized the Grazing Service to grant ranchers individual grazing allotments and set fees for grazing. The fee to graze a horse was twice that for a cow, and as a result, ranchers allowed unbranded horses to run loose rather than pay for them. At the time the Taylor Grazing Act was passed, it was estimated that 50,000-150,000 horses roamed wild on public land subject to the Act.Wyman, p. 161 The Grazing Service, along with the Forest Service, was committed to removing the free-roaming horses, which were viewed as mavericks, from the lands they administered. In 1939, the Grazing Service began to directly hire people to remove horses from public land.Wyman, p. 170 The United States Forest Service periodically gave ranchers notice to round up their strays and thereafter shot any remaining horses. In 1946, the BLM was formed by combining the General Land Office and the Grazing Service. It no longer directly removed horses from the lands it administered, but issued permits to hunters. It is unknown how many free-roaming horses were on the public lands at that time, and it is not clear if there were too many horses, or if the land was incurring damage due to the presence of the horses,Ryden, p. 211 but removal probably exceeded the animals' reproductive rate, resulting in a decline in numbers. After World War II, captured horses were often slaughtered to meet the demands of the pet food market. By the 1950s, the free-roaming horse population was down to an estimated 25,000 animals. Horses were being chased to exhaustion by airplanes, poisoned at water holes, and removed with other inhumane practices. Between 1950 and 1959, led by Velma Bronn Johnston‚Äîbetter known as \\"Wild Horse Annie,\\"‚Äîanimal welfare and horse advocates lobbied for passage of a federal law to prevent the capture of wild horse by inhumane methods. Their efforts were successful. On September 8, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the Hunting Wild Horses and Burros on Public Lands Act, , also known as the \\"Wild Horse Annie Act\\", which banned the hunting of feral horses on federal land from aircraft or motorized vehicles. Ownership of free-roaming herds remained contentious, and ranchers continued to use airplanes to gather them.Ryden, p. 233 Horses were still subject to individual states' estray laws,Fischamn, p. 120 and no law prevented the complete elimination of horse herds. Federal agencies also continued to try to eliminate horses from areas where they were perceived to be causing resource damage. Under BLM policy, ranchers could release a branded mare into a herd then later round up not only the mare, but the band the mare ran with, for slaughter or sale. In Nevada, state law permitted ranchers to round up any unbranded horses on their private land and slaughter or sell them. Concerned about these practices, and about continuing horse hunts in unprotected areas, International Society for the Protection of Mustangs and Burros of which Johnston was the first president, began working to pass federal legislation to protect feral horses throughout the U.S. She was joined by a number of prominent people, including country music singer Judy Lynn, Gunsmoke actress Amanda Blake, and New Hampshire Union Leader publisher and conservative William Loeb III, who continued to lobby for federal rather than state control over the disposition of free-roaming horses. In 1962, public pressure lead to the establishment of the Nevada Wild Horse Range, and in 1968, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range was established. In 1969, the National Mustang Association, headquartered in Utah, persuaded Senator Frank Moss to introduce a bill (S-2166) to protect the remaining mustangs of Spanish descent under the Endangered Species Act of 1966. However, since the bill also called for the removal from public lands of all non-Spanish horses, it came under heavy opposition. Federal protection for all free-roaming horses was ultimately accomplished by the passage of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, which specifically states: \\"A person claiming ownership of a horse or burro on the public lands shall be entitled to recover it only if recovery is permissible under the branding and estray laws of the State in which the animal is found.\\" which alleviated the problem of horses being rounded up under the auspices of belonging to local ranchers. Ranchers were given a specified time period following passage of the Act to claim their horses, and any remaining unbranded and unclaimed herds roaming BLM or Forest Service became the property of the federal government.Mustang Country, p. 5 Implementation Mustangs in Arizona The Act gave jurisdiction over challenges to BLM and Forest Service management of wild horses and how the act is implemented to the Department of the Interior's Board of Land Appeals.Iraola, p. 1051. The act also contained provisions for the removal of excess animals; the destruction of lame, old, or sick animals; the private placement or adoption of excess animals; and even the destruction of healthy animals if range management required it.Iraola, p. 1053‚Äì1054. Revisions proposed in 1974 increased concern that destruction of free-roaming horses could resume. However, the destruction of healthy or unhealthy horses almost never occurred, and in January 1982, the director of BLM issued a moratorium on the destruction of excess adoptable animals.GAO-09-77, p. 3 A mare attends to her foal on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge. The Act left range management policy unresolved in many respects, although it did specify that BLM and the Forest Service consult with state wildlife agencies.Iraola, p. 1052. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting).Pitt, p. 515‚Äì516. In November 1971, the BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountain herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountain range was said to have increased by 17 percent over the 1968 level,Pitt, p. 518. but there was strong disagreement over whether the population had actually increased. Pursuant to the 1978 amendments to the Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA),Glover, p. 1110‚Äì1111. the BLM established 209 herd management areas (HMAs) where feral horses were permitted to live on federal land. As of 2013, the number of HMAs had been reduced to 179, covering 31.6 million acres. Three HMAs are dedicated solely to the protection of feral horses: the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range in Montana, the Little Book Cliffs Wild Horse Range in Colorado and the Nevada Wild Horse Range in Nevada. Another HMA is dedicated to feral burros, the Marietta Wild Burro Range, also in Nevada. In 1973, BLM began a pilot project on the Pryor Range known as the Adopt-A-Horse initiative.Pitt, p. 528. The program took advantage of provisions in the Act to allow private \\"qualified\\" individuals to \\"adopt\\" as many horses as they wanted if they could show that they could provide adequate care for the animals.Glover, p. 1111‚Äì1112. At the time, title to the horses remained permanently with the U.S. federal government. The pilot project was so successful that BLM allowed it to go nationwide in 1976. In 1978, Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA) authorized the BLM to relinquish title to adopted horses after one year of satisfactory private maintenance. Through 2001, the Adopt-a-Horse program was the primary method of disposal of excess feral horses from BLM and Forest Service land. Despite the success of the adoption program, the BLM struggled to maintain acceptable herd levels, as without natural predators, herd sizes can double every four years. As of 2013, there were over 40,000 horses and burros on BLM-managed land, exceeding the BLM's estimated \\"appropriate management level\\" (AML) by almost 14,000. In addition to these on-range horses, there are 49,000 additional wild horses, also protected under the Act, living in off-range corrals and pastures. The BLM uses limited amounts of contraceptives to control herd numbers, in the form of PZP vaccinations; advocates say that additional use of these vaccines would help to diminish the excess number of horses currently under BLM management. As of 2013, the BLM is also researching the possibility of spaying some mares to permanently prevent pregnancies, and a new vaccine, the \\"first single-shot, multiyear wildlife contraceptive for use in mammals\\", has been approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency. From 1988 to 2004, Congress prohibited BLM from using any funds to destroy excess animals.GAO-09-77, p. 59 In 2008, the BLM announced the possibility of euthanizing excess horses, a move which was quickly condemned by horse advocates. Legal challenges A gather of horses from the Paisley Desert Herd Management Area The constitutionality of the new law was disputed. Up until then, feral horses and burros were considered to be under the jurisdiction of State estray laws, and managed as unclaimed livestock that the Federal government had no right to interfere with.Fischamn, pp. 119-20 To test this assertion, in 1974 the New Mexico Livestock Board seized 19 free-roaming feral burros which were preventing cattle from using a watering hole on federal land. The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico held that, under the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress could regulate \\"wild\\" animals only to protect public land from damage.Fischamn, p. 122 The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that Congress's power to manage public land \\"necessarily includes the power to regulate and protect the wildlife living there.\\"Fischamn, p.132 and that, unclaimed free-roaming horses could be considered \\"wildlife\\" for purposes of determining whether Congress has the power to protect them.Fischamn, p. 131 In United States v. Johnson, 685 F.2d 337 (9th Cir. 1982) the act was challenged in court for being unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally overbroad in its definition of \\"unbranded and unclaimed horses\\". The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the wording of the act.https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-johnson-36\\\\- In the early 1980s, the Mountain States Legal Foundation (foundation) and the Rock Springs Grazing Association (association) won a writ of mandamus by the District Court requiring the BLM to remove all horses from the private lands of the \\"checkerboard\\" of private and public lands grazed by the association, and to reduce the number of horses on the public lands. The District Court, however issued a summary judgement for the government against the contention that feral horses who ate grass or drank water on privately owned lands had \\"taken\\" these resources from the ranchers in violation of the \\"takings clause\\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the government must compensate the private landowners $500,000. The foundation appealed the summary judgement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Hodel, 799 F.2d 1423 (1986), cert. den'd. 480 U.S. 951 (1987), the appeals court remanded the summary judgement back to the district court, which ultimately ruled that a wild animal was not an \\"agent\\" of the federal government and hence could not be found guilty of \\"taking\\" the ranchers' grass or water.Iraola, p. 1064. However, in 2000, the \\"takings\\" argument was brought up again, this time in Bradshaw v. United States U.S. Court of Federal Claims 47 Fed.Cl. 549 (Sept. 15, 2000) wherein the plaintiffs held that free-roaming horses were taking forage that they paid for with their grazing permit, and the horses were drinking water from springs for which they owned the water rights. The court dismissed the argument, referring back to the earlier court findings. Although the PRIA limited the number of horses that could be adopted in any one year by a single adopter to four, it allowed the BLM to make exceptions to the limit. In the mid-1980s, the BLM had placed for adoption over 20,000 horses to large scale adopters, and thousands of the horses were slaughtered. In March 1987, the Animal Protection Institute sued the Department of the Interior, arguing that BLM was turning a blind eye to \\"adopters\\" who obtained horses with the intent to slaughter. In Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 671 F. Supp. 695 (1987), the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held that BLM could not ignore the intent of adopters. The decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 860 F.2d 920 (1988). In 1988, the BLM terminated the large scale adoption program. In 1997, the Animal Protection Institute and BLM signed an out-of-court settlement under which BLM would require individuals to sign an affidavit stating they had no intent to sell the animal for slaughter or for use as rodeo stock. The settlement also required BLM to establish rules requiring horse slaughterhouses to maintain paperwork on horses for no less than one year and to report any horses to which clear title was not established. BLM also agreed to no longer permit adoption by proxy or power of attorney. But the district court refused to enforce this settlement in 2000, leaving the issue unresolved.Glover, p. 1113, 1115‚Äì116. In November 1996, Congress passed the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act, which clarified the earlier 1976 amendment to the Act authorizing BLM and the Forest Service to use helicopters and motor vehicles to round up and transport feral horses on public lands.Government Accountability Office, p. 12. Accessed 2011-06-07. The use of helicopters in roundups has been challenged by feral-horse advocates on the grounds that they are dangerous to the horses. In 2011, a case was brought before the U.S. District Court in Nevada, regarding a roundup in that state, alleging in part that helicopter pilots flew too close to horses. The judge in that case issued a temporary restraining order against the \\"mistreatment of mustangs during BLM gathers\\", including inadequate distance between helicopters and animals.Raia, Pat (September 2, 2011). \\"Federal Judge Warns BLM Over Helicopter Use in Roundups.\\" The Horse. Accessed 2013-09-21. In 2013, the BLM issued new policy directives covering humane treatment of animals during roundups, including the use of helicopters, and stated that \\"further animal handling policy changes [are expected] in the future\\".Raia, Pat (February 1, 2013). \\"New BLM Policies Address Mustang Welfare, Roundup Transparency\\". The Horse. Accessed 2013-09-21.\\"Wild Horse and Burro Gathers: Comprehensive Animal Welfare Policy.\\" Bureau of Land Management. January 23, 2013. Accessed 2013-09-21. Subsequent Congressional action In 1976, Congress included a provision in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act that permitted the humane use of helicopters in capturing free-roaming horses on federal land, and for the use of motorized vehicles in transporting them to corrals. When problems with the Adopt-a-Horse program emerged and the BLM was accused of allowing too many adoptions so as to deplete feral horse populations on federal land and allowing \\"adopted\\" horses to sell for slaughter, in 1978 Congress passed the Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA). The PRIA limited adoptions to only four horses a year per individual and allowed BLM to relinquish title to the horse after one year (during which inspections regarding the animal's treatment were to occur).Pitt, p. 521‚Äì522. The law also required BLM to inventory all feral horse herds, scientifically determine what constituted \\"appropriate\\" herd levels, and determine through a public process whether \\"excess\\" animals should be removed. Congress further amended PRIA in 1978 to require updated herd counts. In 2004, Republican Senator from Montana Conrad Burns inserted a rider into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 (a 3,000-page omnibus appropriations bill) which amended the WFRHBA to require the BLM to sell excess animals more than 10 years old or which have been offered for adoption three times.Iraola, p. 1054.Nack, William. http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2063939GAO-09-77, p. 60 The amendment also required that excess, unadoptable horses \\"shall be made available for sale without limitation.\\" Burns was reportedly acting on behalf of ranching interests, who wished more of the horses removed from federal land. The legislation, signed into law by President George W. Bush, was described by one media outlet as \\"undercut[ing] more than three decades of lobbying and legislative action aimed at protecting America's wild horses from slaughter\\". In May, 2005 the \\"Rahall Amendment\\" was passed to limit implementation of the Burns amendment by preventing appropriated funds to be used to facilitate the sale and slaughter of protected wild horses and burros. In the 2007 Interior Appropriations Act the language of Rahall Amendment was re-added. As of August 2012, it remained in effect. In early 2005, the BLM discovered that some of the excess wild horses it had sold had been slaughtered.GAO-09-77, p. 55 BLM suspended the sales program in April 2005 and resumed it in May 2005 after implementing new requirements to deter buyers from slaughtering the animals. In the fall of 2007, the last three horse slaughterhouses in the United States closed.GAO-09-77, p. 54 In January 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that a 1949 Texas law banned the possession, transfer, or sale of horse meat. This ruling forced the two slaughterhouses in Texas to close. In September 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld a similar ban in Illinois, causing the plant located in that state to close. However, BLM procedures do not ban the export of wild horses for sale and slaughter outside the United States. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded BLM was not in compliance with the 2004 amendment, as the department had imposed limitations on the sale of excess horses to help ensure that they were not slaughtered. The GAO also stated that the BLM had a serious \\"dilemma\\" in the need to balance their charge to protect and preserve the feral horses with their charge to destroy or sell without limitation excess animals. It recommended that the BLM \\"develop cost-effective alternatives to the process of caring for wild horses removed from the range in long-term holding facilities and seek the legislative changes that may be necessary to implement those alternatives\\".GAO-09-77, pp. 60-63 In February 2009, U.S. Representatives Nick Rahall, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, introduced HR 1018, the \\"Restore Our American Mustangs Act\\". The act, if passed, would have amended the 1971 Act to increase available acreage for feral horses, develop additional sanctuaries, \\"[forbid] the killing of healthy animals, and [allow] greater public participation in herd management decisions.\\" The bill passed a House vote on July 17, 2009 with a vote of 239 for and 185 against, but died in the Senate after being referred to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

They live on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range located in the Pryor Mountains of Montana and Wyoming in the United States, and are the only mustang herd remaining in Montana. They are protected by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA) and managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), who has set the optimum herd number at 120 animals. Genetic studies have revealed that the herd exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity and a low degree of inbreeding, and BLM has acknowledged the genetic uniqueness of the herd. Pryor Mountain Mustangs are relatively small horses, exhibit a natural ambling gait, and domesticated Pryor Mountain mustangs are known for their strength, sure-footedness and stamina. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range is one of the most accessible areas to view feral horse herds in the United States and tourism to the area has increased in recent years. Feral horses are documented as living in the Pryor Mountains by the early 1700s, although they may have been there since the late 1600s. By the late 1800s, thousands of feral horses inhabited the area. In the early 1900s, many of the unbranded horses were rounded up, to allow domesticated livestock to graze the range without competition, and by 1964 there were only around 200 horses left. In 1964, the BLM announced that the horses would be removed altogether, to the outrage of the public. The controversy continued until 1968, when the BLM was legally stopped from removing all of the horses, and the area declared a Wild Horse Refuge. After the 1971 signing of the WFRHBA, the BLM spent the 1980s and 1990s conducting population studies and developing management and adoption policies; during this time, numerous genetic studies were also completed. The BLM management of the herd has included improvements to the range to give the horses additional access to water, and numerous roundups that have resulted in the removal and adoption of hundreds of horses to private individuals, including over 50 horses in 2009, 44 in 2012, and 17 horses in 2015. Once again, every horse captured was adopted. Another gather was slated to begin in September 2018, with 17 horses identified for removal. However, it was cancelled amidst concerns that it would have a detrimental impact on herd genetics. Characteristics A herd of Pryor mustangs The Pryor Mountain mustang has a very specific conformation type. The breed generally stands high, with an average of .Dutson, p. 209Lynghaug, p. 106 The horses weigh on the range, and more if raised in captivity. They exhibit a wide range of solid colors, including bay, black, chestnut, dun, grullo, and blue or red roan. Buckskin coloring is rare but does occur, and pinto coloring can be minimally expressed. The dun-colored horses on the range exhibit primitive markings such as dorsal stripes, transverse stripes across the withers, and horizontal \\"zebra\\" stripes on the back of the forelegs. The Pryor Mountains horse's body is heavy, with strong bones. Manes and tails tend to be long, and the horse's winter coat is very heavy and often curly. The head is convex (sometimes called a \\"Roman nose) or straight, with wide-set eyes, hooked ears, and a broad forehead that tapers well to the muzzle. The front teeth meet evenly, the upper lip is usually longer than the lower, and the nostrils are small and crescent shaped. The neck is medium in length, and most of the animals have only five lumbar vertebrae (an anatomical feature common in primitive horses)‚Äîalthough some have a fifth and sixth vertebrae which are fused. The horse's shoulders are long and sloping, the withers are prominent, and chests are medium to narrow in width. The croup is generally sloped, and tail-set is low. The hooves are large and very hard. Some Pryor Mountain mustangs exhibit a natural ambling gait. They are generally intelligent, strong, and sure- footed, and exhibit great stamina. Like all feral horses, they generally avoid human contact, are distrustful, and are easily spooked. However, once they are familiar with an individual, they can exhibit a strong social bond with that individual. Pryor Mountains horses can be broken and ridden, and trained to do any task a domesticated horse can perform. Trained Pryor Mountains horses have a calm temperament, and are alert on trails. The horses form bands or \\"harems,\\" in which a single stallion mates and controls a group of about six mares. Another eight to 10 \\"bachelor\\" stallions accompany the band at a distance, hoping to win control of it from the stallion or mate with mares. History Crow scout on horseback in the Pryor Mountains in the early 1900s Historians and scientists speculate that feral horses have lived on and near Pryor Mountains since at least the late 1600s.Singer and Schoenecker, p. 39. Tradition of the Crow people maintains that the horses came to the area by about 1725. The Eastern Shoshone also inhabited the region during the 1700s.Billings Field Office, pp. 46‚Äì47. Non-Indian explorers found native people in possession of large numbers of horses as early as 1743.Pomeranz and Massingham, p. 15. Thousands of feral horses lived in the area by the time American pioneers began settling near the Pryor Mountains in the late 1800s.Cruise, p. 185 Between then and the 1930s, many domesticated horses were turned loose on the range, accidentally or on purpose; domesticated stallions were turned out to mate with mares on the range with the goal of producing cavalry remounts for the military. With passage of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, cattle and other horses were allowed to graze in the area, and by 1946, the BLM was formed. Through the 1940s, there were no protections for the wild horses on the range, and loose, unbranded horses were routinely rounded up so as to not compete with cattle for forage. Some were sold to slaughter, others kept for riding. However, with the passage of the Wild Horse Annie Act in 1959, motor vehicles were prohibited from being used to capture, harass or chase wild horses. By 1964, there were approximately 200 horses remaining in the area, which were seen as a \\"symbol of the Old West\\"Ryden, p. 239 by local citizens. That year, the BLM announced its decision to remove all horses from the Pryor Mountains and disperse the herd through public auctions, a move that was strongly opposed by the public. Public opposition to the plan succeeded in delaying any movement against the horses. By 1968, the wild herd were concentrated mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups and construction of boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, this time with the possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment,Ryden, p. 244 while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving.Ryden, p. 246 The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.Ryden, pp. 248‚Äì250 The battle over the Pryor Mountain herd moved to the national level on July 11, 1968, when ABC broadcast a special on the horses on the evening news. The public reacted with outrage,Ryden, p. 251 and the BLM responded that \\"no decision had yet been made regarding the horses.\\"Ryden, p. 252 However, by the end of August, a trap to collect the horses had been completed. At the same time, the BLM was unresponsive to efforts by members of the public, senators and officials from the Humane Society of the United States to ascertain final plans regarding the horses. Because of this, court proceedings were begun, and on August 27, 1968, a US District Court judge made a decision that had the result of barring the BLM from removing the horses from the range.Ryden, pp. 254‚Äì256 On September 9, 1968, the Secretary of the Interior, Stewart L. Udall, declared the area inhabited by the Pryor Mountain mustangs as the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Refuge (PMWHR), in a decision later noted in the Congressional Record.Ryden, p. 256 After the creation of the refuge the BLM appointed a committee to study the area and make recommendations regarding appropriate herd numbers. The committee, which met in late 1968 and early 1969, was made up of range and wildlife experts, local citizens interested in the herds and representatives from several federal, state and private organizations.Ryden, pp. 256‚Äì258 A boundary adjustment was made to the refuge, adding some land in Wyoming. The final report of the committee, submitted in June 1969, was that the horses were not in danger of starvation, that overgrazing was likely due to domestic sheep who utilized the land decades earlier, and that horses were the most likely of any species to be able to survive and thrive in the Pryor Mountain environment.Ryden, p. 259‚Äì61 On December 18, 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA) was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon. The Act made it a crime for anyone to harass or kill feral horses or burros on federal land, required the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals, required studies of the animals' habits and habitats, and permitted public land to be set aside for their use.Naughton, James M. \\"President Signs Bill to Protect Wild Horses on Federal Lands.\\" New York Times. December 18, 1971.Government Accountability Office, p. 13. Accessed 2011-06-07. The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service were jointly charged with responsibility for administrating the Act.Billings Field Office, p. 3. The National Park Service was also involved in the management of the land.Billings Field Office, p. 16. These federal agencies were limited to managing horses only on public lands where \\"wild horses were documented as being 'presently found' at the time of the passage of the Act in 1971.\\"Billings Field Office, p. 43. Genetics A 17th-century engraving of a Barb horse It was widely believed that the Pryor Mountains horses were direct descendants of the Barb horses brought to North America by Juan de O√±ate's expedition to explore America north of the Rio Grande in the early 1600s. Bloodlines may also include American Saddlebred, Canadian, Irish Hobby, and Tennessee Walking horses. In the early 1900s, stallions of Thoroughbred and Arabian ancestry were also turned out onto the range. However, the breeding of the Pryor Mountain herd was in dispute for many years. One horseman hired by the federal government during the 1920s to round up excess feral horses on the range stated, \\"The whole country around was overrun with thousands of homesteaders' horses ... but this little band ... were, and are, the genuine Spanish horses and there were about 70 head. I did not try to get them and hoped that no one else ever would.\\"Pomeranz and Massingham, p. 80 Other people claimed that the horses were nothing more than local domestic horses which had escaped to the wild. In 1992, equine geneticist Dr. E. Gus Cothran conducted genetic studies on the herd, and concluded that their primary bloodlines did descend from Spanish Barbs.Lynghaug, p. 104. Since no genetic variants were observed not also seen in domestic horse breeds, in 2010 Cothran also concluded the horses were not a unique species which had survived in North America from prehistoric times.Cothran, p. 3. Accessed 2011-06-07. Rather, they were linear descendants of the Spanish Barb, with some evidence of genetic similarity to light racing and riding breeds.Cothran, p. 4. Accessed 2011-06-07. The genetic tests also revealed that the Pryor Mountains horses carried a rare allele variant known as \\"Qac\\" that only Spanish horses brought to the Americas also carried.Billings Field Office, p. 8. Accessed 2011-06-07. Dr. D. Phillip Sponenberg of the Virginia‚ÄìMaryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, an expert on horse breeds, observed that, physically, the horses conform to the Colonial Spanish Horse type. Genetic studies have also revealed that the herd exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity, and BLM has acknowledged the genetic uniqueness of the herd. Because of the unique genetic makeup of the Pryor Mountains mustang herd, Cothran concluded in 1992 that \\"the Pryor herd may be the most significant wild-horse herd remaining in the United States.\\"Quoted in Ryden, p. 320. Sponenberg agreed, noting, \\"[These animals] don't exist anywhere else.\\"Cohen, Betsy. \\"Survivors of Time: Lost Horses of the Pryor Mountains.\\" The Missoulian. August 15, 1999. Accessed 2011-06-07. This herd was the subject of the 1995 documentary film Cloud: Wild Stallion of the Rockies and its sequel, the 2003 documentary film Cloud's Legacy: The Wild Stallion Returns.Hill, p. 361. Management of the Pryor Mountains horse herd has focused on fulfilling the Free-Roaming Wild Horse and Burro Act's requirement that BLM maintain a \\"thriving natural ecological balance\\". In general, BLM initially focused on how many horses the range could support and in maintaining conformity to the Pryor Mountains standard. However, with the development of DNA testing in the mid 1980s, the focus changed to include maintaining the herd's genetic viability. In 1988, researchers at Washington State University authored a paper which raised concern that the herd exhibited a lack of genetic diversity, and could be suffering from genetic drift and/or a population bottleneck.See, generally: Kirkpatrick and Gilluly, 1988. Accessed 2011-06-07. BLM contracted with Cothran (then at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Kentucky, but now at the Texas A&M; College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences) to take random genetic samples of the herd in 1994, 1997, and 2001. Cothran's analysis found \\"no evidence of a bottleneck\\".Cothran, p. 5. Accessed 2011-06-07. Genetic diversity was actually above the mean for feral horse herds in the United States, and just below the mean for domesticated breeds. The BLM, however, interpreted these studies in 2009 to indicate that the genetic diversity of the Pryor Mountains herd is \\"well above\\" the mean for domestic breeds.Billings Field Office, p. 18. Accessed 2011-06-07. Cothran considered the herd to be in genetic equilibrium, although he cautioned that a minimum of 120 breeding-age animals should be kept on the range to maintain the genetic health of the herd. Research by biologists and veterinarians at Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky, and other colleges found that there is little inbreeding in bands, as the stallions tend to drive off colts when they are about two years old.

BLM counts the herd visually about every four years by flying over the range, reporting on each animal found, and using statistical methods to correct for historic undercounting and other problems.Government Accountability Office, p. 2. Accessed 2011-06-07. In 1984, BLM set the maximum carrying capacity of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range at 121 adult animals, and revised this to 95 adult animals in 1992.Government Accountability Office, p. 71. Accessed 2011-06-07. For years, BLM had also allowed any horse to be adopted from the range. Since adopters favored \\"pretty\\" horses, the color genetics of the herd altered so that mostly bays and blacks were left on the range.Lynghaug, p. 105. Adoption procedures changed in 1994 so that now the original colors and patterns of the herd are returning. In 1992, a private group, the Pryor Mountains Mustang Breeders Association was formed to preserve the gene pool of the herd and establish a registry for Pryor Mountains horses in private hands. In order to be placed on the register, the horse must have a registered sire and dam, have a title issued either by BLM or the Tillett ranch, and have a certificate of blood typing from the Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky. As of 2008, 209 horses in 16 U.S. states and one Canadian province were on the registry. BLM undertook a roundup of the horse herd in 1997 to reduce its numbers, and officials expected to do another in late 2000 when the herd size reached 200. By August 1999, there were 180 adult horses and colts on the range. =Policy changes and post-2000 roundups= In May 2009, after several long-term studies of the rangeland, the BLM determined that the range's maximum carrying capacity was 179 feral horses.Billings Field Office, p. 11. Accessed 2011-06-07. This assumed that all BLM land, as well as lands leased from other owners (public and private), would continue to be available to the animals, and that the BLM would be able to manage the horses by using artificial watering sites to encourage the horses to utilize undergrazed portions of the range. The BLM also said it would implement other range management techniques,See: Billings Field Office, p. 104. Accessed 2011-06-07. and proposed purchasing of land from the state of Montana, and another of private land, to add to the range. At the same time, BLM said it would reduce the herd from its existing 195 adults to 120.French, Brett. \\"Wild Horse Range Pressured By Overgrazing.\\" Billings Gazette. July 12, 2009. Accessed 2011-06-07. The stated goal was to temporarily remove horses from the refuge to allow the range to recover from the historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range.Billings Field Office, p. 103. Accessed 2011-06-07. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age.Billings Field Office, p. 27.

BLM began its roundup of feral horses on the Pryor Mountains range in early September 2009. After several days, 130 of 188 feral horses were rounded up. Forty-six horses were put up for adoption, while the freed mares were given a contraceptive vaccine to help keep the herd population down. Also in 2009, BLM also placed \\"guzzlers\\" on the range. A guzzler is a precipitation (usually rainwater) collection device which traps water in a storage tank ranging in size from a few to several thousand gallons. The storage tank can be above-ground, partially buried, or below-ground. A mechanical valve releases water into a drinking trough from the storage tanks, allowing animals access to the water. When the valve senses that the water level in the trough is low, it opens and allows more water into the drinking area.For general information on guzzlers, see: Mitchell, Dean; Larsen, Randy; and Raymer, Danny. \\"What the Heck Is A Guzzler?\\" Wildlife Review. August 2006. Accessed 2011-06-08. Five guzzlers were placed in undergrazed areas to encourage the horses to better utilize this forage. In August 2012, another roundup was completed, resulting in a further 45 horses being removed and adopted out to the public through an auction. In this gather, 38 adults and 7 foals were removed, and the public paid an average price of $225 for each horses; the maximum paid was $2,300 for a mare and foal combination. During the roundup, 63 mares were treated with contraceptives, and the post-gather herd population was estimated at 133 horses.\\"Completed FY 2012 Gathers\\". Bureau of Land Management.

The price paid for these horses is higher than that paid for horses from most other Mustang herds; horses removed from unnamed herds in Oregon can be adopted for a walk-up fee of $125. However, it is lower than the price paid for horses from some other popular herds; horses from the Kiger mustang herds sometimes sell for over $7,000 each.\\"Burns District Planning Update: Fiscal Year 2008\\" (PDF). Page 45. Bureau of Land Management. Accessed 2013-10-17. As of 2013, the BLM estimated there to be 145 horses in the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (PMWHR), a number above the \\"Appropriate Management Level\\", which has continued to be set at 120. The PMWHR is the only Herd Management Area (a BLM area managed for feral horses and/or burros) in Montana. There are six additional Herd Areas (BLM areas that currently have or have had in the past populations of wild horses, but are deemed not suitable for horses) in the state, but none currently contain horses, leaving the Pryor Mountain mustangs the only free- roaming mustangs remaining in Montana.\\"Herd Area and Herd Management Area Statistics FY 2013.\\" (PDF). Page 15. Bureau of Land Management. Accessed 2014-01-02. In the fall of 2010, BLM issued a set of draft strategy documents for operating its wild horse programs, and solicited public comment on the plans.Whitcomb, Rachel. \\"BLM Eyes Greater Cooperation With HSUS on Wild-Horse Gather.\\" DVM Newsmagazine. September 1, 2011. Accessed 2011-09-26. After receiving numerous comments, BLM said in February 2011 it would quicken the pace at which it made revisions to its roundup procedures, use of fertility control drugs, and wild horse and burro range land management. The agency also commissioned a study from the National Academies of Science (NAS) on wild- horse management. In September 2011, BLM announced it would begin working with the Humane Society of the United States to develop new practices in herd management and roundup, and increase its emphasis on adoptions and the use of drugs as fertility control to help better manage its wild horse herds. The results of the study by the NAS were released in June 2013, and covered a wide variety of issues, including the carrying capacity of wild horse and burro ranges, wild horse and burro population growth, and best practices in fertility control. Overall, the NAS was critical of the BLM, saying that herd populations were increasing at an \\"unsustainable rate\\" and that the \\"BLM fails to effectively use contraception tools\\", criticizing the methods used for estimating populations and available forage, and stating that the agency has failed to communicate appropriately with the public. This report applied to all BLM-managed equine populations, and was not specific to the PMWHR.Raia, Pat. \\"NAS Pans Current BLM Mustang Management.\\" The Horse. June 6, 2013. Accessed 2014-01-02.

Early life James Grant was born on July 28, 1793, in Ross-shire, Scotland, son of William Grant. His paternal grandfather, Alexander Grant, was a veteran of the Battle of Culloden of 1746 who later became a director of the East India Company and was the last man to escape from the Black Hole of Calcutta.Reid (2007), p. 13. Grant attended medical school, and in 1812 he joined the East India Company. Despite his young age, with the influence of his cousin Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg, he was named the surgeon for the General Stuart. Just before leaving on his maiden voyage, Grant married Margaret Urquhart, the daughter of an East India Company official.Reid (2007), p. 14. Over the next seven years, Grant made three voyages with the East India Company to India and to China. In a brief visit home, he fathered a son, Stewart Majoribanks, who was born in 1817. His daughter Jamesina was born five years later. On his voyages, Grant, like most of his comrades, did a little trading of his own, resulting in a respectable fortune. In 1823, he traveled to northern Mexico, ending up in Texas. He became interested in real estate and purchased an estate in Parras, Coahuila, Mexico in 1825.Thomas W. Cutrer, \\"TOLER, DANIEL J.\\", Handbook of Texas Online , accessed June 10, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In Coahuila, he was soon involved in politics, where he became secretary of the Executive Council. In 1832, he was a member of the legislature of Coahuila and Texas.Robert Bruce Blake, \\"GRANT, JAMES\\", Handbook of Texas Online , accessed June 09, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In 1832 and 1833, he tried his hand in colonizing a settlement near Goliad. In 1833, Grant moved to Nacogdoches, Texas. From March through April 1835, Grant was secretary of the legislature of Coahuila and Texas at Monclova, Mexico. In Coahuila, he acquired vast landholdings and was friends to the Federalist Mexicans and enemies to the Centralists. In 1834 and 1835 he was \\"Jefe de Armas\\" or Commander of the local military police. In the spring of 1836, Grant and the Mexican legislators were forced to flee Coahuila when President Santa Anna sent General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos with a regiment of the Mexican army to disperse the congress. Texas Revolution He was soon a member of the Texian Army, serving from December 1835 through March 1836, during the Texas Revolution and fighting in the Siege of Bexar.Hardin (1994), p. 78. In San Antonio, he would help plan the assault on BexarSantos (1968), p. 5. and negotiate the surrender of Cos. He served as a Goliad delegate to the Consultation. In early December, Grant was advocating for an expedition to invade Matamoros, suggesting Houston was not the person to be in charge of the Texian Army.Hardin (1994), p. 107. By January 10, 1836, Grant and Frank W. Johnson, who were old partners in Monclova land deals, were seeking volunteers to join a Federal Volunteer Army of Texas to march on Matamoros.Todish et al. (1998), p. 30. On January 14, Sam Houston arrived in Goliad to take command of the army that Grant and Johnson had recruited. He soon discovered that Grant and Johnson had established themselves as commanders of the army. Houston went along with the Texian army, instilling camaraderie as they reached Refugio, Texas. In Refugio he approached the soldiers, telling them how a small army could not conquer a city of 12,000 and thereby convinced over half of the men to quit. That same day, Houston would receive word that he had been removed by the council as commander of the army and had been replaced by James Fannin. Houston left the army and traveled to negotiate with the Cherokees in the eastern region of Texas.Hardin (1994), p. 110. For several months it was unclear if Grant, Fannin, Johnson, or Houston was in charge of the Texian army. In the early spring of 1836, Grant and Frank W. Johnson continued their quest towards Matamoros. As co-commanders of the Matamoros Expedition with about 70 to 100 men, they went as far as San Patricio to gather horses for their expedition.Santos (1968), p. 65. Grant was informed that Mexican Captain Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez and a small company formerly from Fort Lipantitl√°n was in the area. Grant confronted and overtook them, confiscated their horses and took the men as prisoners to San Patricio. Within a few days the prisoners had escaped, alerting Mexican forces. Splitting into smaller groups, the Texians searched for mounts and supplies, proceeding all the way to Santa Rosa Ranch. Grant and a group of fifteen Texians while foraging, were attacked by members of General Jos√© de Urrea's cavalry. Grant was killed in the battle of Agua Dulce at 10:30 a.m. on March 2, 1836.Hardin (1994), p. 111.

This family owned winery is now in the care of son Bill Moularadellis who further developed the business with expansion of vineyards throughout the Riverland, as well as building long term relationships with premium growers in Adelaide Hills, Coonawarra, Clare Valley and Langhorne Creek. In 2000 the company was found to have added banned silver nitrate to their wine, had their export license suspended and were prosecuted.http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s127415.htmhttps://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/may/28/foodanddrink While maintaining a family, hands-on culture, Kingston is now Australia's sixth largest winemaker in terms of tonnes of grape intake, and twelfth largest in terms of total revenue. Its Riverland winery, at Kingston-on- Murray, approximately 220 kilometres from Adelaide in South Australia, produces more than a million cases of premium-quality varietal table wines each vintage. Of this branded wine, 60 per cent is exported to markets such the UK, New Zealand, Canada, Germany and Sweden as well as to emerging markets such as China and Singapore. Kingston employs more than 70 full-time staff, with total employment swelling to more than 100 during vintage. The winery is a very modern facility with crushing capacity of 80,000 tonnes per annum, stainless steel storage capacity of 30 million litres and an extensive oak- maturation cellar. The Kingston Estate winery is the sixth largest winery in Australia in terms of wine grape intake. Kingston is a keystone of Riverland's foundation as one of Australia's major wine grape growing areas, with about 30% of South Australia's wine being made within a 40-kilometre radius of the Kingston winery.  History  1956: Sarantos and Constantina Moularadellis emigrate independently from Greece and settle in South Australia's Riverland. 1961: The Moularadellis family purchased a small fruit block in Kingston-on- Murray. 1965: The family purchased a second 40-acre Riverland property planted with shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot vines. Initially, grapes from this property were sold to major wine producers. 1979: Kingston Estate is established.James Halliday Australian Wine Companion 2012 Edition, Hardie Grant Books, 2011 p.360 Until the mid-1980s the business remained a small family affair with the wine-production facility only processing fruit from the family vineyards and selling bulk wines to major producers. 1985: Eldest son Bill Moularadellis (born 1964) graduated in oenology from Roseworthy Agricultural College and joined the family business.http://www.visitvineyards.com/south-australia/south-east- australia/wine/vineyards-wineries/info/kingston-estate-winery 1986: Bill Moularadellis crushed his first vintage of 60 tonnes, principally red, and produced Kingston Estate's first commercial output of some 4500 cases. Bill saw the opportunity for Australian wines in the international market, including the UK and Sweden. 1994: Awarded South Australian business of the year as well as the Kingston Estate 1991 Reserve Chardonnay won double gold at the San Francisco International Wine Show and the Hyatt Advertiser Award for South Australia's best Chardonnay.The Australian Wine Pictorial Atlas 1998/99 Edition, Thomas K. Hardy, Vintage Image Publications 1997 1995: The value of Kingston's exports tops the $10m mark. 1998: Kingston expands its vineyards, planting about 300 acres of vines on the Sturt Highway, opposite the winery at Kingston-on-Murray. A further 200 acres were planted in 1999. Key components of this expansion were merlot and petit verdot, until then little known in Australia but selected by Bill Moularadellis as being especially suited to the Riverland. 1999: Bill Moularadellis offers long-term contracts to grapegrowers in other South Australian regions. This provided the opportunity to further increase wine quality, blending options and style development. Today, approximately 30 per cent of the winery's grape intake is from other premium regions throughout South Australia, including the Clare Valley, Adelaide Hills, Langhorne Creek and the Limestone Coast wine zone. This growth in diversity of fruit supply has contributed significantly improved wine quality, especially in the Kingston Estate range. 2000: Kingston Estate acquired Swan Hill based Ashwood Grove. 2001: Kingston Estate launched its Kingston Estate Echelon Selection range, focussing on non-mainstream premium grape varieties. 2003: Bill Moularadellis‚Äô vision for petit verdot was further vindicated when the Kingston 2002 Echelon Selection Petit Verdot wins top gold in its class at the 2003 Royal Melbourne Show and is the only non-mainstream red in the taste- off for the Jimmy Watson Memorial Trophy. 2010: Kingston Estate winemaker Donna Hartwig named The Wine Society Members‚Äô Choice Winemaker of the Year at the 2010 Young Winemaker of the Year awards held in Sydney on 12 November 2010 2011: Kingston Estate owner and winemaker Bill Moularadellis appointed to the board of Wine Australia Corporation 2017: Kingston Estate awarded Australian Shiraz Winery of the Year at the 2017 Berlin International Wine Competition.https://berlininternationalwinecompetition.com/index.php/2017-winners 2018: Kingston Estate is ranked Number 12 'Australia's largest wine companies' in terms of sales revenue.Top 20, Australian & New Zealand Grapegrower & Winemaker, April 2018, Page 14, Winetitles Media, South Australia.

Founding and early plans In mid-1763, French Governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie granted a trade monopoly over the west upper Mississippi region to Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, a New Orleans merchant.Primm (1998), 8. Maxent quickly engaged the service of Jean Francois Le Dee and Pierre Lacl√®de to build trading posts in the Illinois Country. Fur trading was becoming a more lucrative profession and many more started to travel up the Mississippi River for the same reason. Shortly before the upriver departure of Lacl√®de in August 1763, word arrived that France had ceded its territory on the east bank of the Mississippi to Great Britain according to the Treaty of Paris (1763), giving new significance to the trading posts on the west bank. The group led by Lacl√®de included his young stepson Auguste Chouteau and roughly twenty boatmen with a cargo of trade merchandise. On November 3, 1763, the group arrived at Ste. Genevieve and Fort de Chartres, where they stored their merchandise while preparing to build a new settlement farther north. They had to act quickly as the midwest brutal winter was setting in. In December, Lacl√®de and Chouteau scouted potential locations on the west bank, with Lacl√®de determining the suitability of a site with a gentle slope ending in a rocky bluff above the river's floodwaters. Lacl√®de marked the area and instructed Chouteau to return in the spring to clear the land for construction.Primm (1998), 9. The men returned to Fort de Chartres for the winter to recruit workers, but in February, Lacl√®de sent Chouteau and 30 men to begin construction of cabins and a shed for supplies. The settlement was established on February 15, 1764.Fausz (2011), 104. Lacl√®de himself arrived in April 1763 to inspect the site, at which point he named the village St. Louis and provided detailed plans for laying out streets and for construction of his headquarters.Primm (1998), 10. The plan of the village was similar to that of New Orleans, including a public marketplace centered on the riverfront and a grid street pattern.Primm (1998), 13. The market, Lacl√®de's headquarters, and a church stood in a line of blocks west from the bank of the river, and the market block was separated from the river by a limestone block ledge. Three streets ran parallel to the river: First Street (also known as La Rue Royale, La Grande Rue, and Main Street), Second Street (also known as La Rue d'Eglise or Church Street), and Third Street (also known as La Rue des Granges or Barn Street).Primm (1998), 14. North of the market block and perpendicular to the river was Market Street (also known as La Rue de la Place or La Rue Bonhomme); south of the market block were Walnut Street (also known as La Rue de la Tour) and Chestnut Street (also known as La Rue Missouri). In addition, many prominent, intelligent figures, such as Marie-Th√©r√®se Bourgeois Chouteau, had moved to St. Louis, and with their keen eye and intelligence, was able to advise the new residents on how to best prosper in the local government and home. The settlement began to gain French Creole residents from Cahokia and Fort de Chartres quickly during 1763 and 1764 due to fear of poor treatment by British soldiers who were sent to Illinois after the Treaty of Paris. As the primary civil and business leader in the village, Lacl√®de awarded lots to the new settlers. Soon, it became one of the most emigrated to cities in the United States, with some forty families moving there from east bank settlements.Primm (1998), 11. In October 1765, the transfer of the east bank to the United Kingdom was completed, and the French Lieutenant Governor Louis St. Ange de Bellerive officially moved the upper Louisiana capital to St. Louis. After his arrival, St. Ange was responsible for awarding lots, and land transfers began to be recorded in Livres Terriens (land books). By 1770, St. Ange had awarded eighty-one lots, which encompassed nearly all of the village's forty-nine available blocks.Primm (1998), 15. The St. Louis street grid in about 1780 Life under Spanish control Although Spain nominally gained control of Louisiana according to the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762, the first Spanish governor of the territory, Antonio de Ulloa, arrived in New Orleans only in March 1766. Ulloa did not rule for long, however, and was expelled from New Orleans by French colonists in the Louisiana Rebellion of 1768.Primm (1998), 18. He was replaced as governor by Alejandro O'Reilly, who suppressed the rebellion and who appointed Don Pedro Piernas as lieutenant governor of upper Louisiana in August 1769.Primm (1998), 20. The French commandant of the village, St. Ange, transferred formal control to Piernas on May 20, 1770, and St. Ange was named assistant to Piernas and special adviser on Indian affairs.Primm (1998), 22. After the transfer, Piernas confirmed St. Ange's and Lacl√®de's land grants and rented Lacl√®de's headquarters as government offices, and Spanish soldiers provided local security.Primm (1998), 23. Early landowners in St. Louis were required to enclose their lots with wooden or stone fencing for security reasons, and lots contained sheds, barns, vegetable gardens and sometimes fruit trees. No retail or commercial district existed, and business generally was conducted in homes or in the market square. Houses ranged from one-room huts to large, multiroom buildings such as Lacl√®de's stone headquarters. Most homes, however, were square, of poteaux-en-terre construction, and with steep oak shingle roofs with long overhangs in typical Creole design.Primm (1998), 16. The residents depended on common land south of the town for firewood and pasture land, which extended from Third Street west nearly three miles, north to Mill Creek, and south for several miles until the 1790s when it was truncated for the new settlement of Carondelet, Missouri. The commons were continually reduced in size after the mid-1780s due to land grants to new settlers, and the remaining land not granted became Lafayette Park in 1838. In addition to access to the commons, each lot owner was granted individual use of a field strip measuring one arpent wide and forty arpents long. Each strip was part of a larger group of fields that were platted at the same time; a total of four such fields were created between 1766 and 1769, and by the 1790s nearly 6,000 acres were under cultivation around St. Louis.Primm (1998), 17. In spite of this agriculture, fur trading was the major focus of many residents. The block containing the first Catholic church in St. Louis Although the villagers were nominally Roman Catholic, they were not inclined toward religiosity.Primm (1998), 31. Upon the arrival of Piernas to St. Louis in 1769, there was no church and no enforcement of laws relating to religious observances. Within a month after taking office from St. Ange in May 1770, Piernas had urged the residents to build a log chapel on the church block, which was dedicated by Father Pierre Gibault of Kaskaskia on June 24, 1770. Gibault officiated at the chapel regularly in spite of being under the authority of the bishop of Quebec and being a British subject, and he performed dozens of masses and sixty-four baptisms until 1772. In May 1772, a Capuchin priest named Valentine became the first resident priest in St. Louis (although he technically was the chaplain to the Spanish garrison), and through early 1776 he baptized 64 French, 24 blacks, and 19 Indians, and he officiated at 72 funerals and 4 weddings.Primm (1998), 32. The estate of former commandant St. Ange contributed funds toward the building of a new church in 1774, but it was delayed by the death of its carpenter until mid-1776. In May 1776, Valentine was replaced by another Capuchin, Father Bernard de Limpach, who became the first pastor of the St. Louis parish, and with this and the completion of the new church building, Catholic religious observance became a customary component of life in St. Louis.Primm (1998), 33. Among the earliest problems confronting the Spanish commanders of St. Louis was the issue of Indian slavery, which was abolished by a decree written by Spanish Governor O'Reilly and published by Piernas in May 1770. However, the ban was openly violated by St. Louisans during the summer of 1770, and Piernas requested guidance from the new Spanish governor, Luis de Unzaga (who had taken office in March 1770 after O'Reilly retired to Havana). The new governor and Piernas interpreted the abolishment by agreeing to halt further purchases of Indian slaves but allowing the retention of current slaves and any children born to them.Primm (1998), 24. These Indian slaves generally were replaced by African slaves via manumission, although some remained in bondage until the 1830s when freedom suits led to final Indian emancipation. In 1772, a census determined the population of the village to be 577, including 444 whites (285 males and 159 females) and 193 African slaves, with no Indian slaves reported due to their technical illegality.Primm (1998), 25. Upon the promotion of Piernas to a new post in New Orleans in 1775, control of St. Louis passed to Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Cruzat, who continued the lax enforcement of Spanish policies common under Piernas.Primm (1998), 27. The population of the village increased to nearly 700, and in 1775, St. Louis merchants exported several hundred quintals of flour to New Orleans. In 1778, however, Cruzat was removed as commander of St. Louis upon the orders of Spanish Governor Bernardo Galvez, who was responding to British complaints that Cruzat had allowed Spanish agents to violate British territory in Illinois.Primm (1998), 34. The same year, Pierre Lacl√®de, founder of St. Louis, died while returning from a trade expedition to New Orleans. Galvez replaced Cruzat with Fernando de Leyba, who moved the government offices from Lacl√®de's former stone house and headquarters and sold the property to Auguste Chouteau.Primm (1998), 35. St. Louis in the American Revolution Since the beginning of hostilities between the British and their American subjects, Spanish governors in New Orleans assisted the American rebels with weapons and ammunition.Primm (1998), 37. Along with his appointment as the new commander of St. Louis, Fernando de Leyba was instructed to abet any rebel Americans in British territory and recruit Catholics living in British territory to move to St. Louis. Upon his arrival in St. Louis, Leyba invited George Rogers Clark, an American colonel who was leading the Illinois campaign and had recently captured the town of Kaskaskia, to a two-day banquet and reception in his honor. Leyba also encouraged St. Louis merchants to supply Clark's forces with weapons and provided guarantees of credit for Clark.Primm (1998), 38. By early 1779, the British commander Henry Hamilton had retaken the town of Vincennes, and his forces were advancing on Kaskaskia.Primm (1998), 38. Hamilton informed Leyba and Galvez that if American forces retreated to Spanish territory, he would pursue them there and attack Spanish forces, likely attacking St. Louis.Primm (1998), 38. However, Clark managed to defeat the British forces and capture Hamilton himself in February 1779, averting the threat to the town. After the entrance of Spain on the side of the Americans in June 1779, the British developed a strategy to attack St. Louis and other Spanish settlements along the Mississippi using fur traders and Indians. The British force departed Prairie du Chien on May 2, 1780 with more than 200 traders and Indians.Primm (1998), 40. Prior to their departure, however, an American trader had alerted Leyba in St. Louis as to the plan, giving time to develop defensive measures around the town.Primm (1998), 41. Only one of four planned masonry towers was built, near the current intersection of Fourth and Walnut streets, and the rest of the town was surrounded by more than a mile of entrenchments. As a British force of nearly 1,000 approached in early May (augmented along its journey by more Indian forces), more than 150 militia took up positions in the fortifications around St. Louis. The Battle of St. Louis as depicted in a mural at the Missouri State Capitol On May 26, the British and Indian forces attacked the town of St. Louis, but were forced to retreat due to the fortifications and defections of some Indian forces.Primm (1998), 42. In spite of their defeat, the British attack destroyed much of St. Louis' agricultural lands and cattle stock, killed 23 residents, wounded 7, and captured 25 as prisoners.Primm (1998), 43. The battle losses and his inability to pay merchants for supplies given to the Americans damaged Leyba's reputation in St. Louis, and Leyba died after a lengthy illness on June 28, 1780.Primm (1998), 44. Galvez quickly reappointed former commander Francisco Cruzat, who arrived in St. Louis with ammunition, weapons and supplies to defend the town. In late 1780, Cruzat sent an expedition force from St. Louis to attack British forces at Fort St. Joseph, which successfully destroyed any future British plans to attack St. Louis or other Mississippi outposts.Primm (1998), 45. After 1781, the British permanently evacuated the lands east of the Mississippi, leaving the land to the Americans. A lack of effective American government there led many remaining Creole families to emigrate to St. Louis from 1780 to 1783, bringing about a 19% increase in the population to about 900, not including slaves.Primm (1998), 46. Among these families was that of Gabriel Cerre and Charles Gratiot, merchants from Kaskaskia and Cahokia.Primm (1998), 47. Upon his arrival in St. Louis, Cerre was counted as the wealthiest merchant in the town, owning more than 850 acres of land around St. Louis and 6,000 acres along the Meramec River.Primm (1998), 48. Cerre's daughters married into the elite of Creole society, including eldest daughter Marie Anne who married Pierre-Louis Panet of Montreal in 1781; second daughter Marie Therese who married Auguste Chouteau, co-founder of St. Louis in 1786, and the youngest daughter Julia married Antoine Soulard, a surveyor who added significant property additions at the periphery of St. Louis.Primm (1998), 50. Charles Gratiot, the second major merchant to relocate to St. Louis at the end of the American Revolution, also added to the wealth of the community. His English and trade skills allowed him to aid the Americans during the war, but in 1781, he relocated to the west bank, where he married Victoire Chouteau, daughter of Lacl√®de and sister to Auguste Chouteau. During the 1790s, he conducted trade with Americans migrating west, and he also operated a mill and distillery on his farm to the west of the village. Eventually through land grants and purchases, Gratiot became one of the largest landowners in the area, with his primary farm stretching west from present-day Kingshighway Boulevard to far beyond the city limits to present-day Big Bend Boulevard, and from the northern edge of present-day Forest Park to Chippewa Avenue on the south.Primm (1998), 51. During his lifetime, Gratiot and his wife raised nine children to maturity in status and wealth (especially his son Charles Gratiot, a significant engineer and soldier), forming the basis of another group of St. Louis elites. The two merchant families of Gratiot and Cerre intermarried with the Chouteau family to create a society in the 1780s and 1790s that was dominated by French Creoles with marital ties to Spanish government officials, including lieutenant governors Piernas and Cruzat. Transfer to France and the United States Rivers in the St. Louis area Throughout the 1790s, the area near St. Louis expanded as small farmers sold their lands to the Cerres, Gratiots, Soulards, or Chouteaus in St. Louis.Primm (1998), 63. These farmers moved to outlying towns founded after St. Louis, including Carondelet (originally called Delor's Village or Vide Poche), which was founded in 1767 by an ex-naval officer near the mouth of the River Des Peres.Primm (1998), 61. The village in 1796 had 181 residents, and it normally produced food surpluses for the area.Primm (1998), 62. Another of the area villages was St. Charles, which was founded on the north bank of the Missouri about 20 miles northwest of St. Louis. Its population in 1800 was roughly 600. The third major satellite village in the area, Florissant, was founded on the south bank of the Missouri about 15 miles northwest of St. Louis and had a population of nearly 300. By 1800, only 43% of the St. Louis district's population (excluding St. Charles district) lived within the village of St. Louis (1,039 of 2,447).Primm (1998), 63. Some of these small farmers and artisans, upon hearing news of the successes of the French Revolution, began agititating in the late 1790s in support of French ideals.Primm (1998), 67. On September 22, 1796, a group of St. Louis artisans led a \\"noisy celebration\\" in support of a return of Louisiana to an egalitarian French government. In a show of strength, the Spanish governor sent a fleet of galleys and soldiers with military supplies to reinforce Spanish control of St. Louis. However, even while the Spanish colonial officials were trying to maintain control of Louisiana, the Spanish government was attempting to transfer the territory to France.Primm (1998), 68. The Spanish government secretly returned the unprofitable Louisiana territory to France in October 1800 in the Treaty of San Ildefonso.According to Primm (1998), 68, Spanish expenditures in Louisiana were $795,000, with only $68,000 in customs revenue. After a promise by French leader Napoleon Bonaparte not to sell Louisiana without giving Spain the right of first refusal, the Spanish officially transferred control of Louisiana to France in October 1802. However, Spanish administrators remained in charge of St. Louis throughout the time of French ownership. Upon the transfer of control, the Spanish administrator in New Orleans (upon Napoleon's orders) revoked the right of deposit for American merchants at New Orleans. This encouraged the United States under President Thomas Jefferson to send a team of negotiators to France in early 1803 with the purpose of gaining navigation rights on the Mississippi; however, Napoleon instead sold all of Louisiana, including St. Louis, to the United States on April 30, 1803, as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate in November 1803, and the transfer of power from Spain was made official in St. Louis at a ceremony called Three Flags Day.Primm (1998), 69. On March 8, 1804, the flag of Spain was lowered at the government buildings in St. Louis and, according to local tradition, the flag of France was raised. On March 10, 1804, the French flag was replaced by the flag of the United States. Notes References * Ekberg, Carl J., and Sharon K. Person.

She is best known internationally for her role as Kriemhild in director Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen series of two silent fantasy films, Die Nibelungen: Siegfried and Nibelungen: Kriemhild's Revenge. Stage career Born in Magdeburg, Germany as Margarethe Schippang, she received private acting lessons with the theatre actor Hans Calm in Dessau. In 1912 she made her stage debut in Bad Freienwalde. Shortly thereafter, she received a commitment at the municipal theater of Bromberg (now, Bydgoszcz, in present- day Poland). From 1915 to 1918 she was part of the ensemble cast of the Deutsches Theater in Hanover, and from 1918 to 1945 she performed at the Staatstheater Berlin. Film career In 1919, Margarete Sch√∂n made her film debut in the Carl Wilhelm-directed Du meine Himmelsk√∂nigin. She would spend the next two years in several small roles for directors Carl Froelich, Hanna Henning, Alfred Halm, Walter Schmidth√§ssler and her husband, director Robert Dinesen before earning a starring role in Urban Gad's 1922 drama Hanneles Himmelfahrt. It was in the 1924 release of Fritz Lang's two-part fantasy serial Die Nibelungen that she would cement her popularity in Germany and achieve international recognition as an actress. Co-written by Lang's then- wife Thea von Harbou, the films were based on the epic poem Nibelungenlied written around AD 1200. Sch√∂n had a starring role as the vengeful Kriemhild, opposite actor Paul Richter's role as the epic hero Siegfried.DEFA der Filmsterne Sch√∂n made the transition to sound films with ease and her film career was prolific through the 1930s. During the Second World War she appeared in approximately ten films, but generally avoided roles in Nazi propaganda films and stayed decidedly apolitical. One exception was an uncredited bit part in Veit Harlan's 1945 nationalistic film Kolberg.CineArtistes One of her most popular roles of the era was the character Frau Knauer in the Helmut Weiss-directed comedy Die Feuerzangenbowle in 1944 for Terra-Filmkunst studios. After the Second World War Sch√∂n continued in West German films as a popular character actress, she also worked extensively as a radio personality. From 1948 to 1950 she worked for DEFA (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft}, the state-owned film studio of East Germany. She retired from acting in 1960. Personal life The grave of Margarete Sch√∂n, her mother Marie, and husband Robert Dinesen, at the Friedhof Heerstra√üe cemetery in Berlin-Westend Sch√∂n was married to Danish director Robert Dinesen. In 1968, she was awarded the Bundesfilmpreis for many years of outstanding achievements in German film. She died in West Berlin in 1985, aged 90, and is buried at the Friedhof Heerstra√üe cemetery in Berlin-Westend.DEFA der Filmsterne Selected filmography * Schirokko (1918) * Freiheit, Gleichheit, Br√ºderlichkeit (1919) * Das Tor der Freiheit (1919) * Spiele eines Milliard√§rs (1919) * The Dancer (1919, part 1, 2) - Maria Friesl√§nder * The Duty to Live (1919) * Du meine Himmelsk√∂nigin (1919) * The Loves of K√§the Keller (1919) * Der Tempel der Liebe (1919) * Gewalt gegen Recht (1920) * Das gro√üe Licht (1920) * The Golden Crown (1920) - Prinzessin Elvira * The Women of Gnadenstein (1920) - Ruth * Der gelbe Tod (1920, part 2) * The Passion of Inge Krafft (1921) - Dagmar, Harry Radens Frau * The Sleeping Volcano (1922) * Kinder der Zeit (1922) * Hanneles Himmelfahrt (1922) - Johanna, Hanneles Mutter * Insulted and Humiliated (1922) * Firnenrausch (1922) * Die Nibelungen (1924) - Kriemhild * Struggle for the Soil (1925) - Franz von Wulfshagen * Wallenstein (1925, part 1) * Our Heavenly Bodies (1925) * Bismarck (1925, part 1) * Lace (1926) * A Day of Roses in August (1927) - Helene von Rudow * Die Welt ohne Waffen (1927) * Youthful Indiscretion (1929) * The Youths (1929) * Beware of Loose Women (1929) * Der Weg durch die Nacht (1929) * Hocuspocus (1930) - Geschworene * The Flute Concert of Sanssouci (1930) - Princess Amalie * The Street Song (1931) - Emma * In the Employ of the Secret Service (1931) - Hans hustru * Abschiedswalzer (1934) - Madame Mercier * Der gr√ºne Domino (1935) - Frau von Falck * Mazurka (1935) - (uncredited) * Victoria (1935) - Die M√ºllerin, Mutter Johannes' * Arzt aus Leidenschaft (1936) - Frau Felgentreu * Moral (1936) * Girls in White (1936) - Maria Petrowna * Annemarie.

It was produced by TeamTO and Tuba Entertainment, in association with Cake Entertainment, and Synergy Media with the participation of TF1, in coproduction with Canal+ Family, Teletoon, EBS, BENEX, and Carrimages 5, and the support of National Center of Cinematography and the moving image (CNC), the Rh√¥ne-Alpes Region, the Poitou-Charentes region and Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA). Although the series contains no dialogue, it features the voices of Marie Facundo, Sly Johnson, Martial Le Minoux and J√©r√©my Prevost. Originally, the series was called Ooohhh Asis, and was composed of seven one- minute-and-a-half episodes, which were broadcast from 26 March 2008 to 30 May 2009 on TF1. Oscar's Oasis debuted in its new format at the 2010 MIPTV Media Market. The series premiered on Canal+ and Canal+ Family in September 2010, and was broadcast on TF1 since late summer 2011. In July 2011, the series was released on Nintendo 3DS in 3D. The show started airing on Gulli on July 2nd, 2019. Synopsis Oscar is a lizard living in a non-specific desert that has features from several different real deserts, like the Sahara, Kalahari Desert, and North American deserts. An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Harchi, a hyena; and Buck, a vulture, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner, wherein the law of gravity is briefly suspended while the character comes to realize their imminent doom. Characters =Main characters= The four main characters are: * Oscar is the main character of the show. He is a gecko that is always getting into trouble with the trio ‚Äì Popy, Harchi and Buck ‚Äì and the chickens too. Oscar is always trying to catch flies and find some water, but most of the time things don't come out right. Whenever he has something interesting, the trio always tries to take it from him. Whilst he in turn often tries to steal the trio's food. Voiced by Marie Facundo. * Popy - a fennec fox, the boss of the trio, the one who gives the orders. She is quite clever and sneaky, tricking the other animals as well as the two others in the trio. As shown in the episodes Pronto Express and Bad Seed, she is also greedy. Voiced by Marie Facundo. * Harchi - a hyena, the brawn of the trio, he is given the physical jobs. He normally acts as the driving force behind the makeshift cart that he along with his friends chase Oscar or the chickens with. In the event of them taking a collective tumble, it's he who catches everyone so they avoid the ravine. Sometimes he can also show stupidity. Voiced by Sly Johnson. * Buck - a vulture, the nerd of the trio. This guy always tolerates when Harchi gets yelled at by Popy. Voiced by Sly Johnson. =Minor characters= * Manolo - a truck driver who transports various items in the series. He is always asleep at the wheel while his dog, Roco, drives. Voiced by Martial Le Minoux. * Roco - Manolo's loyal and faithful dog. He always tries to keep their cargo safe and frequently chases Oscar and the trio or tries to deter them from the contents of the moving vehicle. He is generally more friendly with Oscar than with the trio. * The Female Lizard - a female lizard to whom Oscar's heart belongs, though they sometimes compete with each other over things. In the episode Corn to be Wild, she has babies, but it's unknown who her mate is. * The Chickens - their half-closed eyes give them a nonchalant, blas√© appearance. They fall blindly into the traps laid for them, and get out of them without realizing they have escaped any kind of danger. They always try to eat Oscar. * The Crocodiles - the most feared animals of the desert and the top predators. * The Skunk - He doesn't smell good. He is always afraid of Oscar, but the trio are always afraid of him because of his smell. He often takes the trio's fruit. * Meerkats - The \\"Thieves\\" of the desert, they sometimes steal stuff from the trio as they compete with Oscar. In some episodes, however, they work together with Oscar against the trio. * The Dung Beetles - Oscar's friends who occasionally help him out of tough predicaments. In the episode Revenge of the Small Fry, Oscar once helped them roll up a large ball of dung, which they have never forgotten. * Junior - Oscar's adopted son who made only one appearance in the show. Episodes Each episode runs for 7 minutes and there are 78 episodes in total.

Donnelly is known for holding the microphone to the crowd and encouraging them to sing along. Biography Mark Donnelly was born and raised in Vancouver and North Delta, playing ice hockey from the age of 12. Armed with a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of British Columbia, he began singing national anthems for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League while working for a Scranton, Pennsylvania parish. After he and his family moved back to Vancouver, he started doing the same for the Vancouver Canucks beginning in 2001. He made a cameo appearance in the TV show Psych, playing an opera singer in the season four premiere episode \\"Extradition: British Columbia\\", and then another cameo appearance as a singer in the final episode \\"Apotheosis\\" of the science fiction series Caprica. Donnelly and his wife, Catherine have nine children. They and their four youngest children currently reside in White Rock, British Columbia. His brother, Lawrence, is the priest of Ss Joachim and Ann Parish in Aldergrove. He is a staunch supporter of the Canadian pro-life movement. Career = Performer in popular culture = Most recognized for his immensely popular appearances singing the national anthem at NHL games, Mark is commonly referred to as \\"Mr. O Canada\\". As the Signature Performer of the Vancouver Canucks, Mark has won the hearts of hockey fans and all Canadians from coast to coast by holding the microphone to the crowd and encouraging them to sing along to his solid and unabashedly patriotic version of the Canadian national anthem. On October 3, 2014, Donnelly went viral on social media after tripping on a rug while skating and singing \\"O Canada\\" at a Penticton Vees game. =Composer= Though Donnelly has composed and arranged music since he was in high school, it has been both the focus and passion of his musical life since 2009. That passion drives him to write music which, in his words, is \\"for the greater glory of God, and the edification of souls.\\" Donnelly grounds his writing firmly in the great ecclesiastical tradition of the Western Church, using Gregorian Chant and the classical Roman polyphonic school, as exemplified by Giovanni da Palestrina(1525‚Äì94), as model, guide and inspiration. Donnelly's repertoire of liturgical (church) compositions is wide-ranging. He has written numerous Latin motets, masses and Gregorian Chant harmonizations, as well many English hymns and responses. At this time, among other projects, Donnelly is seeking financial support to make a professional quality recording of his Missa \\"Sicut cervus\\" (2012), which is an imitation mass based on Palestrina's famous double motet Sicut cervus / Sitivit anima mea. Primarily a liturgical composer, Donnelly also writes secular choral arrangements and art songs. His epic musical setting of Alfred Noyes' (1880-1958) classic ballad of love & death, The Highwayman, draws on Mark's experience performing the songs of Franz Schubert (1797-1828) and Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958), among others. In 2020, Donnelly was appointed Composer in Residence for Una Voce Canada. Organum Novi Mundi Organum Novi Mundi (organum of the new world, ONM) is a Gregorian compositional technique pioneered by Mark Emerson Donnelly in 1989. Drawing on the tradition and inspiration of Medieval Organum, Donnelly combines this with the harmonic development of the high Renaissance. Sung in the same rhythmic manner of the original Gregorian plainsong, ONM expands on and embellishes the chant‚Äôs simple beauty without drawing the mind of the listener away from the text. Often alternated with unison plainchant, ONM may be in two to six parts. To date, Donnelly has produced dozens of these compositions for parochial use. * Agnus Dei (Mass XVII) * Attende Domine * Media Vita Sacred Music Compositions * Ave Maria * Domine de c√¶lo * Missa \\"Alleluia.

Its design is commonly attributed to Raphael, and was based to Bramante's nearby Palazzo Caprini (also demolished).

DCPP was the first nuclear power plant to have its license suspended, which resulted from disclosure that they installed safety systems incorrectly. In Dark Circle, Mothers for Peace takes credit for delays which prevented the plant from going online prior to the discovery of the errors. Current activities Interest in issues with which SLOMFP contend have received considerable heightened public interest subsequent to the Fukushima nuclear accidents. With discovery of the Shoreline Fault, SLOMFP has expressed heightened concern about Diablo Canyon earthquake vulnerability. The primary current roles of SLOMFP consists of a website, outreach efforts of Jane Swanson, the current spokesperson, fundraising, and litigation. Discovery of a new earthquake fault near DCPP re-energized the anti-nuclear movement in San Luis Obispo county, and Swanson travelled to Santa Barbara and took part in a forum at the Faulkner Gallery of the Central Library on June 30, 2011. The meeting was attended by Supervisor Janet Wolf and co-hosted by the Nuclear Ages Peace Foundation and the Santa Barbara chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. SLOMFP was traumatized by an alleged embezzlement of $31,000 by their former treasurer, who was prosecuted and appeared in SLO criminal court in November for pre-trial procedures. Despite this, and its history of civil disobedience, SLOMFP contends that it possesses security clearances such that the NRC should grant it access to information on terrorism vulnerabilities of DCPP with respect to nuclear spent fuel storage.In some contexts, the contention is that their attorney has top secret clearance, but there is no reliable substantiation of that claim. From the SLOMFP website: The NRC claimed that security considerations ruled out a hearing, even though at a closed hearing only those with the required security clearance would be present. MFP attorney Diane Curran has the necessary clearancehttp://mothersforpeace.org/newsAndEvents/20100518renewal. Swanson frequently discusses various forms of vulnerability, specifically challenging the adequacy of the no-fly zone policies putatively in place over Diablo. For instance, in an interview with KCSB's radio journalist Cathy Murrillo, Swanson contends that according to the FAA it is not a no-fly zone but merely a pilot advisory not to loiter. She frequently cites outside experts such as the Union of Concerned Scientists or the National Academy of Science. Litigation The SLOMFP commenced litigation of five contentions http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2010/03/28/1083768/san-luis-obispo-mothers-for- peace.html#storylink=misearch of which four were accepted to proceed. The litigation before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board has been placed on hold as of the Order of June 7, 2011. This delay has no bearing on the merits but has been proclaimed as a victory by anti-nuclear activists even though it had originally been requested by Pacific Gas & Electric.http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2011/04/11/1558606/pge-asks-for-delay- in-license.html#storylink=mirelated The primary coordinator of the litigation is Elizabeth Apfelberg, who is also Treasurer, whom their website bills as a \\"lay attorney\\". Apfelberg has been with SLOMFP since 1973.Murrillo interview, KCSB, prior to June 30, 2010 Faulkner appearance They also employ attorney Diane Curran.http://www.mothersforpeace.org Swanson was quoted by an environmentally oriented online journalist as summarizing their intent as follows: \\"Our goal, with the services of our attorney in Washington D.C., Diane Curran, is to ensure that safety issues pertaining to both the reactors and the radioactive wastes at Diablo Canyon are fully studied before the NRC considers PG&E;'s application for license renewal.\\" Four contentions The SLOMFP litigation claims that: *PG&E; 's application lacks crucial information on the seismic risks to Diablo. Seismic studies of the newly discovered fault are due to be done in 2013. SLOMFP contends that those reports must be complete before any calls are made regarding earthquake risks. *PG&E; has an \\"adverse trend\\" of chronic errors in the management and cannot identify and correct current problems, despite elaborate measures undertaken by PG&E; as documented on public TV hearings at which SLOMFP members posed numerous questions. SLOMFP claims that aging effects (corrosion, degradation) will defeat the engineers. *PG&E; is not dealing with airborne environmental impacts of potential spent fuel pool accidents, and is thus in violation of NEPA (the National Environmental Policy Act).http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/02/15/08-75058.pdf See also *Abalone Alliance *Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility *Dark Circle (film) *Diablo Canyon Power Plant *San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station References External links * Category:Anti-nuclear organizations based in the United States Category:Environmental organizations based in the United States Category:Anti-nuclear protests in the United States Category:Civil disobedience Category:San Luis Obispo, California Category:Organizations based in California Category:1969 establishments in California Category:Organizations established in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in the United States ","title":"Mothers for Peace"},{"id":"32038146","text":"Arise Evans (or Rhys or Rice Evans) (1607-1660), was a Welsh prophet and fanatic.

A worldwide paddy pest, it is found throughout African countries of Cameroon, Mali, R√©union, Madagascar, South Africa,Poltavsky, A.N., Kravchenko, V.D., Traore, M.M., Traore, S.F., Gergely, P., Witt, Th.J., Sulak, H., Beck, R.H.-T., Junnila, A., Revay, E.E., Doumbia, S., Beier, J.C. & M√ºller, G.C. 2018.

Article and many Asian paddy cultivating countries such as Myanmar, India, and Sri Lanka. Though they are reported from China and Papua New Guinea, they are also known to attack sugarcane. Description The wingspan is about 20‚Äì30 mm. Palpi of male with second joint hollowed out to receive the brush-like maxillary palpi. Antennae with a sinus at base of shaft containing a ridge of scales. Palpi porrect. Male has rufous head and thorax. Abdomen ochreous. Forewings suffused with rufous, darkest below the broad pale costal fascia, which does not reach apex. Hindwings yellowish white. Female moth is much reddish, with a costal fascia often deeply suffused with red. Ecology The larvae feed on various grasses, including Zea mays, Andropogon tectorum, Oryza species, Saccharum sp., and Sorghum species. Attack and control Caterpillars are the major attacking stage. They bore and tunnel in to the tillers and stem and feed on internal tissues and sap. The heavy attack shows small, circular cavities in the stem. This species rarely causes deadhearts or whiteheads. Control can be easy by measures such as stubble rotting, adjusting planting dates and adjusting planting density. Trap crops are used in southwest Nigeria, and this has been effective. Unlike other paddy pests, biological control of this species is not very effective. This is because the borers spend the larval stage within plant stems. But recent study listed five parasitoids that are effective to the borers; they are, Chelonus maudae, Rhacanotus carinafus, Prisfomerus bullis, Prisfomerus caris and Venturia jordanae. Chemical control is effective. References External links *Sampling egg batches of Maliarpha separatella RAG.

Adults have pale brown forewings with two small spots in the centre and light brown hindwings, and they have a wingspan of 35mm. This species is particularly relevant to humans because the larvae are a pest of the Saccharum species as well as several grain crops such as sorghum and maize. Other recorded host plants are cassava, rice and Cyperus species. When attacking these crops, E. saccharina bores into the stems of their host plant, causing severe damage to the crop. This behavior is the origin of the E. saccharrina's common name, the African sugar-cane borer. The African sugar-cane borer is a resilient pest, as it can survive crop burnings. Other methods such as intercropping and parasitic wasps have been employed to prevent further damage to crops.  Taxonomy  The only member of member of the genus Eldana, E. saccharina was described by Francis Walker in 1865. It is of the family Pyralidae of the order Lepidoptera and has eleven subspecies. The common name of E. saccharina, the African sugar-cane borer, is derived from its activity as a pest in stretches of sub-Saharan Africa.  Description  Adult African sugar-cane borers are relatively small with a 3mm abdomen width. They have a wingspan of 35mm. The forewings are a pale brown with two distinct dark brown spots in the center. The hindwings are a whitish brown and contain short fringes and brown longitudinal veins. Both male and female African sugar-cane borers share the same appearance, but females are slightly larger. When resting, E. saccharina folds its wings over its abdomen so that its fore wings are parallel to and cover the white hindwings.Girling D.J. (1978). The distribution and biology of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) and its relationship to other stem-borers in Uganda. Bulletin of Entomological Research 68, 471 ‚Äì 488.Close-up of the head  Distribution and habitat  E. saccharina is indigenous to Africa and is widely distributed throughout sub- Saharan Africa. It can be found in Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and South Africa. There are also populations of the African sugar-cane borer in stretches of northern Africa, in particular Ethiopia and parts of Senegal. Colder temperatures limit E. saccharina's range in these areas of Africa. However, in the Congo-Uganda border, geological events have extended these ranges. There are crater lakes and swamps that are the result of volcanic eruptions, which have been found to contain populations of E.saccharina. E. saccharina primarily lives in sedges and wild grasses among riverine vegetation. However, recently, the African sugar-cane borers have been found to extend their home ranges to graminaceous crops, particularly in eastern and southern Africa. There is also a relationship between soil parent material and existence of the African sugar-cane borer. The species is less prevalent in areas with sandier soils.  Food resources  = Host plants = Rows of sugarcane, the most common host plant for E. saccharina Sugarcane is the main host plant for E. saccharina. This is also the source of the species' common name, the African sugar-cane borer. It will also attack maize, sorghum, cassava, rice, and Cyperus species, and it has also been found to host wild grasses like Guinea grass, wetland sedges like papyrus, rushes, and typha. Various signs indicate the presence of E. saccharina in its host plants. Primarily presence can be determined by stem tunneling and other signs of breakage in plant stems. Infestations of sugarcane can also result in yield losses.Assefa Y., Conlong D.E. and Mitchell A. (2006). Status of Eldana saccharina (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), its host plants and natural enemies in Ethiopia. Bulletin of Entomological Research 96, 497 ‚Äì 504.  Parental care  = Oviposition = Oviposition is the act of depositing eggs. Female African sugar-cane borers prefer to deposit eggs onto dry or dead leaf material. Kairomones, which are semiochemicals emitted by an organism to mediate interspecific interactions, are found in the dead leaves and attract the females to oviposit. In addition to targeting dead leaves, female E. saccharina conceal their eggs between leaf surfaces in tight bunches of around 300 eggs.  Social behavior  = Communication = Communication between E.saccharina is both complex and little understood. Like other moth species, African sugar-cane borers communicate using ultrasound emitted from the tymbal, a sound producing membrane commonly found in insect species. Males producing ultrasound vibrations induce a wing flapping behavior in females, and the signal also functions as a sign of aggression towards other males. When males approach other males, they circle each other while emitting bursts of sound, and eventually one overwhelms the other during the interaction, chasing it away. When males approach females, females either walk past or produce their own sounds. If females reply to the male signal, males will then contact their hair-pencils onto female antennae. These male to female communication behaviors are distinct from mating rituals.  Life cycle  = Egg = The yellow oval eggs are deposited in groups of 250 to 500 onto the inner side of leaf sheaths, structures that tightly wrap near stems, allowing them to fit snugly into the plant stalks. After being laid, eggs typically require 5‚Äì7 days of incubation before hatching. = Larva = African sugar- cane borer larvae appearance range from a light brown to dark grey.Overholt W.A, Maes K.V.N and Goebel F.R. 2001. Field guide to the stemborer larvae of maize, sorghum and sugarcane in Eastern and Southern Africa. ICIPE Science Press, Nairobi, Kenya. They have a distinct brown plate on the dorsal side of their thoraxes, and average larval duration is 31 days. Larvae spread from their hatching site after 1‚Äì3 days. When they encounter predators, larvae excrete brownish liquid from their mouths, which deters predation. After hatching, larvae feed on external surfaces of plants before tunneling into stems where they pupate. This behavior is the source of E. saccharina's common name, the African sugar-cane borer. = Pupa = Pupation is the third stage of moth development during which moths undergo transformation from immature to mature stages. During this time, pupae undergo developmental stages known as instars. Pupae of E. saccharina can be found tunneled inside host plants. They reside very close, often only 5 centimeters, to the exit hole, which is visible on the plant surface. African sugar-cane borers typically pupate for 7‚Äì13 days before emerging from the exit hole. While they are tunneled into the plant, pupae are very resistant to human attempts of removal. They can even survive crop burnings. = Adult = Adult African sugar-cane borers emerge from exit holes in their host plants. Adults usually emerge after a rapid drop in temperature, after which they climb vertically and spread their wings. After 10‚Äì15 minutes of setting their new wings, newly emerged adults only survive for 6‚Äì13 days, during which females spend two days in pre-oviposition and have a 4-day reproductive life. Due to there short lifespan, it is likely that females only mate once.  Enemies  = Predators = Like other moths, African sugar-cane borers experience the greatest levels of mortality during the egg and larval life cycles. Several species of ants and mites have been established as egg predators of E. saccharina. In particular Pheidole, a species of small ants are well-suited to reaching African sugar-cane borer eggs, which are commonly hidden in tight spaces behind leaf sheaths. Mite egg predators are less understood but pose a large problem for E.saccharina due to their small size and abundance in habitats where African sugar-cane borers live. Larger, more aggressive ants like Dorylus as well as some spiders are common predators for African sugar-cane borer larvae. Larval predators often attack young, dispersing larvae or those that have not penetrated into host plant stalks. = Parasites = There have been several parasites found that target E. saccharina larvae. These include: * Agathis sp. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) * Chriodes sp. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) * Schembria sp. (Diptera: Tachinidae) * Goniozus natalensis (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) Of these, G. natalensis is the most significant, because it is the main parasite that affects the African sugar-cane borer. It has been found to attack fourth, fifth, and sixth instar pupae. G. natalensis are attracted to the bore holes left by E. saccharina, and after entering, sting the larva, temporarily paralyzing it and allowing for oviposition. Ovipositing G. natalensis preferentially target female African sugar-cane borer larvae, and their eggs hatch after three days of incubation and proceed to consume the E. saccharina larvae.  Mating  = Displaying = Displaying is a set of courtship behaviors, which are used by an organism to attract potential mates. After emerging, adult males will set their wings and after 30 minutes will begin to display to females. There, they face downwards and beat their wings rapidly. Males tend to aggregate into groups of 3‚Äì6 on the same plant to make it easier for females to locate them. This behavior can continue for anywhere between 15‚Äì20 minutes. During this period, males can either remain stationary or move slightly before restarting the beating. Females, when present, also begin a similar wing flapping behavior. However, this behavior occurs regardless of female presence and releases both an attractant pheromone and an aphrodisiac to entice faraway females. Since the African sugar-cane borer is very sensitive to temperature, male mating behaviors have been found to stop when conditions are below 15 degree Celsius. = Courting = African sugar-cane borer courting has only been documented once in the wild. After encountering a female, a male African sugar-cane borer will face the female with extended antennae. The two will then rotate in a circle with the male following the female, which signals her interest with spread wings. Following the circling, males will then climb onto females and have the tip of their abdomens meet the females. The males will then grip the females' thorax and can copulate for up to three hours. During this time, the pairs will move to lower vegetation as females are particularly vulnerable during copulation. = Pheromones = African sugar-cane borer males secrete pheromones by wing glands and abdominal hair-pencils to attract females. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MC) analysis showed one major volatile component. This compound was identified to be trans-3-methyl-4-dimethylallyl-ùõæ-lactone (C10H16O2).  Interactions with humans  = Pests of crop plants = The African sugar-cane borer larvae enter mature target plants through cracks or openings in the stalk. They have been found to survive crop burnings while bored into the base of the plant and will later emerge as soon as new, young plant shoots appear. Infestations of E.saccharina are more commonly found in intensively grown sugarcane than in peasant-grown fields. This is due to higher levels of nitrogen and water-stress in plants, which is particularly problematic since many industrial fertilizers contain nitrogen.  Pre-trashing  Since African sugar-cane borers, are known to lay eggs specifically in dry leaf material, farmers developed a simple yet effective technique known as pre- trashing. Pre-trashing involves the preemptive removal of dry or dead leaf material from sugarcane field that do not have existing populations of E.saccharina. Not only does this technique prevent African sugar-cane borers from laying eggs and populating new fields, but also any undetected eggs, already present, would be moved too far from the cane stalk for larvae traverse the distance. This technique, however, does have some drawbacks, since pre-trashing does cause irreversible damage to growing plants and reduces crop yield.  Intercropping and host plant breeding  A common method to combat E. saccharina is to intercrop target plants with non-host plants. These trap plants attract female African sugar-cane borers to oviposit where eggs often develop poorly or not at all.Bosque-P√©rez, N.A. (1995). Major insect pests of maize in Africa: biology and control. IITA Research Guide 30. Training Program, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria. 30 p. Second edition. In addition to using existing plant species, researchers have been attempting to develop new plants such as sugarcane that are resistant to pests that often attack and damage them. One such sugarcane plant with resistance to E. saccharina was developed, but it was found that the plant was suddenly attacked and damaged by another organism, C. sacchariphagus, and when resistant to the latter, it was attacked by the former organism.Peshin, R., Dhawan, A.K. Integrated Pest Management: Volume 1: Innovation-Development Process. Biomedical and Life Sciences. Springer Netherlands. 2009  Biopesticide  Other biological methods have also been employed against E. saccharina. Two parasitic wasps, Cotesia flavipes and Xanthopimpla stemmator, attack African sugar-cane borer larvae by parasitizing them. When hatched, the larvae of these wasps consume the pest larvae. This method is particularly useful for targeting larvae that have already bored into the host plant and are normally very difficult to reach.  Silicon treatment  In many plant species, it has been found that applied silicon can enhance a plant species' resistance to pests because it increases silicon deposition in epidermal cells. This increases plant hardness and reduces digestibility. Studies have shown that this is particularly true for the African sugarcane borer, as sugarcane treated with silicon lead to decreased larval penetration and mass gain. Additionally, pests found feeding on silicon treated plants suffer from reduced food intake, survival, and population growth. In potted sugarcane plants, silicon treatment has been found to not only reduce pest damage but also enhance plant tolerance of water-stress. However, these studies did not mention how silicon treatment affected the viability of the sugarcane as a product.

He had gone to the meeting following the Battle of St Matthew's. Three Protestants had been killed, and this had made such a strong impression on Fogel that he wanted to take direct action against the nationalist Catholic community. When Fogel interrupted the meeting, shouting out that \\"talk was not enough\\", the WDA's leader Charles Harding Smith asked him to \\"put some order\\" into the men and give them military training. Fogel took up Harding Smith's suggestion and quickly became his second-in-command. In a candid interview with British journalist Peter Taylor, Fogel stated > The first thing I did was to tell each likely man to find one more reliable > man. Then I did the same with them. That way we got a decent number ‚Äì about > forty. I began to train the men as a military unit. We marched and drilled > and used a field out in Antrim for some training ‚Äì crawling over the grass, > up rope ladders, hand-to-hand-combat, target practice. I showed them how to > make fire bombs. We also carved wooden guns for our training....But it would > be dishonest to pretend that real guns didn't exist.\\"Taylor, p. 101 He enjoyed the important position he held within the WDA, acknowledging that he \\"walked around the streets with the power of life and death over people\\". In September 1971, the WDA and other vigilante groups merged into the umbrella paramilitary organisation known as the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) with Charles Harding Smith as its first commander and Fogel as the second most powerful man in the organisation. He continued to train the new recruits to the local Woodvale UDA unit, of which there were many. According to author Ian S. Wood, Fogel admitted the following: \\"I taught them about unarmed combat ‚Äì you know, how to break a nose, burst an ear drum, dislocate a spine.\\"Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty. A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press. p. 7 He also gave them lectures on guerrilla fighting and the methods of interrogation employed by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) . Role within the UDA The UDA saw its first gun battle with the Provisional IRA in December 1971. Shortly afterwards the British Government suspended the Parliament of Northern Ireland (Stormont) and imposed Direct Rule from London. When Harding Smith and John White had gone to London to purchase arms and were subsequently arrested in April 1972 for gun-running, Jim Anderson, a glazier from Crumlin Road, assumed command of the UDA. It was structured along military lines into battalions, companies, platoons, and sections and had continued to draw new members within its ranks, becoming the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation, having about 50,000 members in 1972.Nelson, Sarah (1984). Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Loyalists and the Northern Ireland Conflict. Belfast: Appletree Press. p. 125 The UDA was legal at the time; it remained so until 1992 when it was eventually proscribed by the government. Fogel took control of west Belfast during Harding Smith's absence, and became leader of the UDA's B Company which covered the Woodvale area. At the end of May, Fogel organised the first UDA roadblocks and barricades, sealing off the Woodvale area into a \\"no go\\" zone which the UDA controlled. Anderson, the de facto commander approved of his action and gave Fogel his full support, and the operation attracted much media and press coverage.Wood, p. 8 Time Magazine described him as a \\"tough, salty Londoner\\" who commanded the Woodvale Defence Association.\\"The World: The U.D.A.\\", Time, 24 July 1972. In an interview with Time journalists, Fogel spoke of his contempt for the middle-class politicians that made up the Ulster Unionist Party. In June, he and two other of his associates drove to Stormont to negotiate with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, who made it clear to Fogel and the others his strong disapproval of their erection of permanent street barricades. His fellow members in attendance at the meeting were Tommy Herron and Billy Hull.McDonald & Cusack, p. 30 Fogel had been a strong advocate of sealing off streets linking to nationalist areas and in July 1972 advocated shutting off Ainsworth Avenue even though it would have meant some fifty Catholic families living on the street would be cut off from the Springfield Road and held within the Shankill. When the plan became known, William Whitelaw was called on by Ainsworth Avenue Catholics and units of the British Army, under Major General Robert Ford were sent to the area where a stand-off with the UDA ensued.McDonald & Cusack, p. 29 In the street negotiations it was agreed that, despite what Whitelaw had stated in the previous meeting, the UDA could erect small temporary barriers and loose plans were put in place for joint UDA-Army patrols, something that the UDA leadership announced at a press conference in the Europa Hotel that same night. That same month the UDA marched through the city centre of Belfast in a massive show of strength. Fogel's power in west Belfast rose and as a result he received many visitors to his home which included American congressmen. It was at that time he received his nickname \\"Big Dave\\". He also hired two bodyguards to look after him. He later described his role within the UDA during 1972 as having been a \\"bit of a policeman, magistrate and welfare worker\\". He often presided over unofficial UDA courts where local offenders from the community were tried. If found guilty, the culprits were given punishment beatings. At the end of the summer of 1972, Fogel, emerging leader Andy Tyrie, and other UDA leaders met with an Army general to discuss the issue of street barricades. By the end of that year, the UDA and their loyalist rivals, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), had carried out 121 killings that they called \\"assassinations. About two-thirds were Catholic victims of what republicans would term \\"loyalist death squads\\".Taylor, p. 113 Fall from power Following Harding Smith's release from imprisonment and subsequent return to Belfast, there was a power struggle within the UDA. Harding Smith had declared to his men upon his return: \\"I'm the boss. I take orders from no one\\".McDonald & Cusack, p. 34 Harding Smith became joint Chairman of the UDA with Jim Anderson while Fogel was interested in taking the organisation down a political path. He, along with UDA \\"enforcer\\" Ernie \\"Duke\\" Elliott, even had meetings with the Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) in Dublin in an attempt to seek common ground and explore the possibility of reaching a working-class settlement with Catholics. On 7 December 1972, Elliott's body was discovered in the boot of Fogel's car; the outcome of the internal UDA feud.Taylor, pp. 101‚Äì02 He had been killed by a shotgun blast to the face. Rumours circulated that Elliott had been killed because he was a Marxist, something frowned upon in loyalism, and Fogel confirmed that Elliott had been a keen reader of the works of Che Guevara. However it later emerged that Elliott, a heavy drinker, had gone to Sandy Row, a loyalist stronghold in south Belfast, to pick up a gun and whilst drunk had pointed it at patrons of the local UDA club. He was taken outside by a local UDA member and the two had a fight over the gun. Other local UDA men got involved and one of them pointed a shotgun at Elliott in an attempt to get him to back off but the gun went off killing Elliott instantly. The shooter fled to England but returned in 1983 and confessed his role in the death, also confirming that it had all been a drunken brawl which at no point involved any ideological concerns.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 34‚Äì35 Fogel believed he was being set up by his associates and before long Harding Smith moved against him. Fogel was accused of embezzling funds from the UDA by Harding Smith, who also put the word around that a senior British Army officer had warned him that Fogel was, in some unspecified manner, a danger to the UDA and an informer. Fogel was even taken into custody by Harding Smith's men for a three-hour period during which he was warned that he must leave the Shankill.McDonald & Cusack, p. 35 When Tommy Herron, the formidable East Belfast brigadier and the UDA's vice-chairman and spokesman, appeared on the scene to challenge Harding Smith's leadership, Fogel was ousted from his position of power. Fearing there would be an attempt on his life, Fogel left the UDA and Northern Ireland for good in January 1973, transferring to England for a life of safe obscurity. Immediately before he left, Fogel had been summond to a \\"meeting\\" in an East Belfast UDA club and decided to leave before it was due to take place, fearing he would be walking into an ambush. Later that year Tommy Herron was shot dead, Jim Anderson had voluntarily stood down, and Andy Tyrie was appointed chairman. Tyrie, an early recruit from the WDA, soon became the UDA's Supreme Commander, a position he would hold until March 1988 when an attempted car-bombing brought about his retirement. Less than four months before on 27 December 1987, the Provisional IRA had succeeded in blowing up influential South Belfast brigadier John McMichael in a booby-trap car bomb outside his home. Charles Harding Smith was long out of the picture. From 1973 to 1975, he had tried in vain to wrest the UDA leadership from Tyrie; finally he had been forced to leave Northern Ireland after surviving several assassination attempts by republicans and by members of the pro-Tyrie faction.Taylor, p. 114 Fogel's final involvement came just after he left Belfast when two journalists from the Sunday Times were brought to his home in southern England for an interview. In the course of the interview, Fogel informed them that the UDA had already imported several shipments of illegal arms, including one brought through the Port of Dublin. The revelations caused alarm among the UDA leadership as they were still presenting themselves as law-abiding and feared the organisation might face legal sanctions if their stockpiling of weapons came out.

Reza Shah Pahlavi abolished this post when he overtook power and reorganisated the military and governmental system. History From the very beginning the Qajar central government was divided into an administrative part (divan) and the army (lashkar), both housed in the citadel (arg) of Tehran. Therefore, the ministry of army (vezarat-e lashkar), later ministry of war (vezarat-e jang) needed an own administration. After the reforms of army (nezam-e jadid, lit. ‚ÄúNew Orderly Army‚Äù) introduced by crown prince Abbas Mirza in 1828, and continued by Nasser al-Din Shah during the second half of the 19th century, the government needed scribes, clerks and civil servants to write and copy lists about tax, salary, material stuff and recruiting. Head of all these clerks in army service was the lashkar-nevis (lit. ‚Äúarmy scribe‚Äù). This governmental post did exist since Safavid time and based on the medieval Islamic official of Arez (from Arabic araza, ‚Äúto lay open to view,‚Äù i.e. inspection), who had charge of the administrative side of the military forces, being especially concerned with payment, recruitment, training, and inspection.Edmond Bosworth: ‚Äú'ƒÄre≈º‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. III, London and New York: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1989. During Nasser al-Din Shah's reign in the course of the 19th century a gradual institutionalization of bureaucratic positions took place and helped to raise the relative status of these ‚Äúmen of the pen‚Äù (ahl-e qalam) to that of the \\"men of the sword\\" (ahl-e seyf). By this fashion, major lashkar-nevises were given honorific titles equivalent to those of high-ranking military officers.Ashraf/Banuazizi: \\"Class System\\", 1992, p. 671. During the Qajar era at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century the office of Lashkar-nevis bashi (Head Lashkar- nevis) was held by two generations of a family coming from Shiraz, later known as Rafat or Jalai: Haji Mirza Fatullah Shuja ul Mulk, Mirza Abul Qasim Khan (son of the former) and Mirza Ahmad Khan Jala ul Mulk (grandson of the Shuja ul Mulk and nephew and son-in-law of Mirza Abul Qasim). Duties The Lashkar-nevis-bashi (Chief Lashkar-nevis) was the chief muster-master of the royal troops, and as the army's paymaster-general, finally, he was head of the whole military administration apparatus in Qajar time. Under Agha Mohammad Khan the Lashkar-nevis was responsible for the recruitment, arrangement, logistics and supply of the whole army; thus combined many of the duties of a modern war minister, paymaster-general, and quartermaster-general.Lambton: Qajar Persia, 1987, p. 99. When the administrative apparatus increased the head of the army was the minister of army (vazir-e lashkar) who later was called minister of war (vazir-e jang) and who hold the de facto title of commander-in-chief. The second man in line was the vazir-e daftar-e lashkar- nevis as comptroller of the army, who was in charge of the army's budget. In this ministry of Daftar-e lashkar-nevis the Lashkar-nevis was responsible to draw up the annual budget of the regiments. Finally, he became the central dignitary of military logistics; as the army's chief caterer and paymaster he was in charge for the salary of every army member (asaker), which included not only military persons but court servants and provincial officials, too. Therefore, the Lashkar-nevis supervised a staff of recruitment clerks of seven scribes and secretaries (moshref) responsible for the exact accountancy of the troops‚Äô supply unit in men and feed. These men were in charge of the muster rolls and recording who was present or not.Bakhash: \\"Administration in Iran\\", 1985, p. 464; Fragner: Memoirenliteratur, 1979, p. 142, fn. 134; Floor: A Fiscal History of Iran, 1998, p. 297.. The different recruitment officials were based in the emarat-e nezam (lit. ‚ÄúEdifice of Army‚Äù, i.e. military headquarter), and the rais-e daftar-e lashkar was chief of the provincial army secretariat, while the mostowfi-ye nezam was the revenue officer of the army.Mostofi: The Administrative and Social History of the Qajar Period, vol. I, 1997, p. 42 ff. Also, it was the muster-master of the area in question who set the system of recruitment clerks under his jurisdiction and to see that his regiment obtained the funds it had been allotted, as well as the rations necessary when it was on active duty. Finally all local reports were checked and collected by a head Lashkar-nevis, called Lashkar-nevis-bashi. He then submitted an annual report of all transactions of the army in his domain to the vazir-e lashkar, who presented his ministry's budget to the ministry of finance. There the costs were written down into the budget cost register (ketabchaneh-ye dastur-e al-'amal).Floor: A Fiscal History of Iran, 1998, p. 297. =Army Recruitment Organisation= The Persian army traditionally consisted of a tribal cavalry force (rekabi) and an infantry unit mostly made of militia volunteers (cherik), which was recruited when it was necessary by the local governors. The central government recruited soldiers for infantry and artillery (tofanghchi va toupchi) from the provinces based on the amount of taxation from each area. This military tax (bonicheh-ye sarbaz) was introduced as a replacement for the old system of tribal levies by Prime Minister Mirza Taqi Khan \\"Amir Kabir\\" in about 1850, based on earlier reforms of Abbas Mirza, and legalized in the recruitment law (qanun-e sarbaziri) of 2 November 1915 by the Persian parliament (majles). Under the bonicheh-ye sarbaz system each village, district, or tribe was required to provide a number of recruits proportional to the amount of its revenue assessment. As with the agricultural bonicheh taxation system, set according to the fertility and running costs of farmland, the base for calculation differed in different areas; it could be amount of land under cultivation, available amount of water, population, or number of animals owned by a tribal group. Theoretically one recruit had to be provided for every unit of revenue, which could range from 12 to 20 Toumans. The recruits only were taken from parts of Iran popular for the best soldiers like Astarabad, Azerbaijan, Khorassan, KordestƒÅn, Mazanderan, Qazvin, Sistan and Zarijan. The southern provinces of Fars and Kerman often were added to these areas of military tax system. In order to offset the resulting imbalance in the tax burden on different provinces, the government reduced the level of cash revenues required from those liable to bonicheh-ye sarbaz and correspondingly increased them for those that were exempt. Land owned by princes, great proprietors, notables, and religious leaders was exempt from this taxation, as was that belonging to Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians, to whom different tax regulations were applied. Also no land tax was levied in the towns, and their inhabitants were exempt, as were peasants living on crown lands.Mostofi: The Administrative and Social History of the Qajar Period, vol. I, 1997, p. 42 ff.; Floor: ‚ÄúBonƒ´ƒça‚Äù, 1990, p. 312; Floor: Fiscal History of Iran, 1998, pp. 358 ff. According to the law, one of every ten men in a village was to be taken for military service; he was supposed to be a padar (taxpayer), an owner of land or cattle. If a man from the same village who was not a padar volunteered for military service, the community had to provide him with funds for during his period of service. So, the army paid the soldier's way to the training camp (where he was drilled a couple of hours per day) and his salary and fodder (hoquq o jireh), during the six-month period in which he was under arms each year. During the other six months he was supposed to be on half-payfrom the provincial budget, estimated on an annual basis, which was entered separately in the budget (dastar al- amal) of each province under the heading shesh-maha-ye mahall (‚Äúlocal six months‚Äô salary tax\\"). With this system the number of recruits needed from each province was calculated by the clerks for the annual provincial budget.Floor: ‚ÄúBonƒ´ƒça‚Äù, 1990, p. 312. The basic training was about a year and the recruited soldier had to be ready to serve about two to four years. Soldiers in service enjoyed only the usufruct of their property; the government held the property itself as security for military equipment and to prevent desertions. In order to support the recruited soldier's family in his absence, either the village as a whole or the remaining nine men of the base group had to pay an annual subvention, called khanvari (‚Äúhome allowance‚Äù). The khanvari was either paid directly to the soldier's family or collected by the government, which was supposed to pass it on to the soldier. Its amount was paid in kind or cash or a combination of both, and was apparently fixed by the interested parties themselves without interference from the authorities; it thus differed greatly from area to area. In cities like Tehran and Tabriz it was 5 and 12 Toumans; in provincial towns like Ardabil 1.5, Qazvin 3 and Urmiyeh 5 Toumans; and in tribal districts like Khalkhal 1, Qaraghan 1.5, Shaqaqi 10 and Qaradaghi 16 Toumans. In some parts of the country, when an infantry or artillery recruit had to join his regiment, the owner of his village (saheb-e bonicheh) or the local peasant proprietors (khorda mallek) had to give him or his family a bounty for support in his absence. It was known as komak-e kharj (‚Äúexpense allowance‚Äù) or padarana (‚Äúallowance‚Äù), the amount varying from 5 to 40 Toumans in cash or kind. Although the khanvari was paid every year, the padarana was paid only once. Some regiments, however, including all cavalry regiments, did not have the right of khanvari, because they were funded and paid by their tribes, called only in case of war and did not receive money while on leave at home.Floor: Fiscal History of Iran, 1998, p. 361 f. The bonicheh-ye sarbaz was collected by a recruitment sergeant (often a large landed proprietor or chief of the district), accompanied by several of his officers and an accountant (mostowfi), touring the villages that were liable for recruits. The regulations stipulated the religion, age, height, and health conditions of prospective recruits. The village elders (rish-sefid) would already have selected those ready for military service. The sergeant would select from among them the most suitable, rejecting the unfit. Richer families paid for exemption from military service. Villages that could not deliver their assessed quotas were in practice reduced to levels reflecting their economic situation. Finally the taxation results were given to the government officials and the muster-master in charge of that region checked all the revenues. Like the alphabetical taxation list he had a master list with all recruits and their costs appropriate to the provincial divisions, and for each province there was a military tax register (ketabcheh-ye bonicheh) in which the method of calculating the tax was stipulated. The chief muster-master headed finally all muster-masters of the different areas of Persia and was answerable only to the minister of army (vazir-e lashkar).Floor: Fiscal History of Iran, 1998, pp. 297, 361. It was common for some regiments to reach only half or three- quarters of their strength on paper, though payment from the Treasury for the full number was collected. Also, the officers of the regiment were entitled to a share of the soldiers‚Äô wages; as they also often appropriated the padarana, and sometimes soldiers were even forced to work in the cities in order to earn their livelihoods. To avoid that the governmental rations would become only a source of income for the local recruiting sergeant, and to secure the right running of recruitment and training, regular inspections took place by the regimental colonel visiting the different units to report the central government about the troop's actual condition and orderly day's life in the headquarters. Periodical parades and camps held by the shah completed these inspections. =Army Budget= With this recruitment system the central government had about 100,000 infantrymen, 30,000 cavalrymen and several units of artillery under its command, including the royal guards, musketeers, footmen and the shah's private household staff. The reports of the Lashkar- nevis documented all costs and vouchers of payment of the entire soldiery of 200,000, which amounted to one-third of the whole annual fiscal expenditure in the time of Nasser al-Din Shah. According to the number of recruits, soldiers and officers the army budget and financing the armed forces was set. Each regiment had a regular (thabet) and an incidental (gheir thabet) budget. The soldiers on duty or official leave during their six-month period per year were paid out of the regular budget. The officers got their funds in cash or kind from the provincial revenue officer the regiment was stationed. Thus they were paid by the provincial government, which got an extra salary for these costs from the ministry of finance. When the army was on operations the costs were paid from the incidental budget. These payments again were paid in cash or kind.Floor: A Fiscal History of Iran, 1998, p. 296 f. All soldiers were equipped with modern European weapons, munitions and short westernized uniforms. Only at ceremonial occasions the high-ranking officials still wore the traditional long uniforms consisting of a long cashmere robe, a wide cummerbund and a high hat (often a length of embroidered cashmere shawl wrapped around the common felt skull cap). Red felt pantaloons and flat slippers completed this formal attire.Mostofi: The Administrative and Social History of the Qajar Period, Vol. I, 1997, p. 42 ff.

He was often referred to by his nickname, \\"Il Nebbia\\" (The Fog). Biography Piazza Vecchia, the old square of Bergamo, now in the Accademia Carrara He was born to an artistically inclined family. His mother was the daughter of Pietro Antonio Gualdi Lodrini, a well-known local painter of religious works, and his brother Marco (1780-1843) also became a painter, although none of his works have been positively identified. After displaying an ability to draw at an early age, Luigi was sent to the \\"Scuola di Pittura e Scenografia\\" in Milan, where he studied with Alessandro Sanquirico. He may have visited Rome at this time, and returned to Bergamo in 1825. He decided to specialize in landscapes and was nicknamed \\"The Fog\\" because his paintings all had a slightly hazy color, and many were set in the winter.Brief biography @ BGPedia. He was a talented musician as well, and often played the bassoon with local orchestras or, occasionally, as a soloist. He performed at both the and the Teatro Riccardi (now known as the Teatro Donizetti). In fact, he was a friend of Donizetti and an associate of other Bergamese artists, including Giuseppe Diotti, Francesco Coghetti and Paolo Vincenzo Bonomini. Many members of the local nobility commissioned him to do frescoes at their villas, and he obtained many similar commissions during a stay in Rome from 1837 to 1842. Notable among these are the frescoes at the and the , both belonging to the Vertova family. He is also credited with decorations at a building owned by the Torlonia family, identified as either the Villa Torlonia at Castel Gandolfo, or the Palazzo Torlonia. If the latter, he probably worked together with his friend, Coghetti. He also decorated several theaters and participated in the production design. He died, unmarried, at his home in 1853. The cause was given as apoplexy. It is unknown if he ever had any students. In 1856, a bust of him by Giovanni Maria Benzoni was placed in the Accademia Carrara.

She was not employed operationally and was sold in 1890. Design Designed by the Rear Admiral George Eliot and the Controller's Department, Waterwitch was a half-sister to and , and all three were built mostly as experimental vessels. While Viper and Vixen were twin screw vessels, Waterwitch had a water-pump propulsion system. Vixen was almost identical to Viper, but was of composite construction. =Hull= Waterwitch was an armoured gunboat of the breastwork type, with a hull constructed of iron.

The forward and aft ends of the box were similarly armoured, although the front end also extended upwards by a further . In addition, a waterline armoured belt extended for the whole length of the vessel. She and her two sisters were the only armoured gunboats ever built for the Royal Navy. Unlike her sisters, she was fitted with a bow rudder as well as the traditional stern rudder. =Sail plan= She was equipped with a barquentine rig. =Armament= Waterwitch was armed with two 7-inch (6¬Ω-ton) muzzle- loading rifled guns and two 20-pounder breech-loading rifled guns. =Propulsion= Waterwitchs unique propulsion system was essentially a vast centrifugal steam-powered pump which drew water from sluices in the centre of the vessel and ejected it in jets from adjustable nozzles. Two sets of nozzles were provided, one for ahead propulsion and one for astern propulsion.Journal of the Franklin Institute By Persifor Frazer, Franklin Institute, Philadelphia (1866) p.396 Steam was provided by two Maudslay iron fire-tube boilers fed from six furnaces. The horizontal Ruthven \\"hydraulic reaction engine\\" was manufactured by J & W Dudgeon and comprised a wheel in diameter weighing and contained within a case across. The wheel was rotated by three steam cylinders and developed . The hopes of safety, performance and control that were expected from this propulsion were summed up by Mr M W Ruthven: Construction Waterwitch was ordered from the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company on 29 October 1864 and laid down the same year.

None of the armoured gunboats performed well in the trials because of their inefficient hull form. Waterwitch was no worse than Viper or Vixen in the speed trials and manoeuvred impressively. Nevertheless, a huge internal volume was required for the internal \\"hydraulic propeller\\"The Hydraulic Propeller, A Description of this Novel Propelling Device, and an Account of its Performance, New York Times, 13 January 1868 and there was little in favour of this early form of jetboat over the then nearly ubiquitous screw propulsion.

By 31 December 2019, its customer base had increased to 12.6 million customers. Location The headquarters of MTN Uganda are located at 69-71 Jinja Road, in the Kampala Central Division, one of the administrative units of the city of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The coordinates of the company headquarters are 0¬∞19'10.0\\"N, 32¬∞35'53.0\\"E (Latitude:0.319444; Longitude:32.598056). In 2016, The Independent (Uganda) reported that MTN Uganda, had plans to construct a new skyscraper between Jinja Road and Old Port Bell Road, where British American Tobacco used to maintain offices, which would serve as the headquarters for the company. Overview MTN Uganda is a subsidiary of MTN Group, a multinational telecommunications group connecting approximately 232 million people in 22 countries across Africa and the Middle East. In 2009, MTN Uganda introduced its mobile telephone-based banking product known as Mobile Money. As of March 2015, MTN controlled 80 percent of the mobile money market in the country. In November 2015, MTN Uganda switched off 3.7 million of its 11.5 million customers to comply with the Uganda Communications Commission's new SIM card registration requirements. In May 2016, MTN Uganda borrowed US$114 million (UGX:385.8 or 380 billion, depending on the source) to expand its network and build a new headquarters building on Jinja Road in Kampala. Funding was in the form of a syndicated loan by a consortium of four Ugandan banks, namely Stanbic Bank Uganda, Standard Chartered Uganda, Citibank Uganda, and Barclays Bank of Uganda (now Absa Bank Uganda Limited). In August 2016, MTN Uganda in partnership with Commercial Bank of Africa (Uganda) introduced a new product that allows customers to save money and access microloan products, using their cell phone. The product, called MoKash is available on personal accounts and on accounts for small and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2018, MTN Uganda launched a joint Tidal‚ÄìMTN music streaming service. The Tidal platform, co-owned by American mogul Jay-Z, offers streaming audio and video for a daily fee of USh1000 (US$0.26). Subscribers receive music, videos and exclusive content. Music from the majority of Uganda's leading artistes is available. At that time, the service was available only in Uganda and South Africa, on the African continent. Initial public offering In 2018 The EastAfrican newspaper reported that MTN Uganda planned to list the shares of stock of the company on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE). That willingness to list, on the part of MTN Uganda, was again reported in March 2019. In March 2020 MTN Uganda agreed to pay US$100 million for a 14 year operating licence and to list 20 percent shareholding on the USE, no later than the second quarter of 2022. The shares sold on the USE will be restricted to nationals of the countries of the East African Community; namely Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Governance As of March 2019, the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the company is Gordian Kyomukama, previously the Chief Technology Officer In June 2019, Wim Vanhelleputte re-assumed his position as CEO, after he returned to Uganda, following negotiations between the Ugandan government and MTN International. Controversy Wim Vanhelleputte was the chief executive officer. He was suddenly deported from Uganda to his native Belgium on allegations of compromising Uganda's national security. This followed the deportation of three other MTN Uganda executives in the month of July, including the General Manager-Mobile Financial Services, General Manager-Sales and Distribution, and Chief Marketing Officer. All were accused of \\"compromising Uganda's national security. The former CEO has since sued the government of Uganda in Uganda's High Court. In May 2019, following negotiations between president Yoweri Museveni and MTN International, Wim Vanhelleputte was allowed to return to Uganda and resume his duties as CEO of MTN Uganda. Licensing In October 2018, the company's initial 20-year operating license expired. Due to prolonged negotiations between MTN and the Ugandan government, the company has since been operating on temporary short- term licenses. In March 2020 MTN Uganda agreed to pay US$100 million for a 14-year operating license. The telecom also agreed to list its shares on the USE and float at least 20 percent shareholding, in an IPO. In July 2020, MTN Uganda received an operators licence for 12 years, starting on 1 July 2020. Under the terms of the new licence, MTN Uganda shall list a portion of their shareholding (minimum of 20 percent), on the Uganda Securities Exchange within 24 months of obtaining the licence. The licence cost US$100 million, which was paid in full in one lump sum. Financials In the 12 months ended 31 December 2019, MTN Uganda's gross revenue amounted to USh1.5 trillion (approx. US$407 million).

It is aimed for children 6 and under. ABC Kids shares the same bandwidth as ABC Comedy which broadcasts outside ABC Kids' scheduled hours and supplements the flagship ABC channel with extra adult-oriented programming. History =Origins= In 1991, all children's programming on the ABC was organized into a daily broadcasting block under the name ABC For Kids. This new programming block featured a range of programming ranging from preschoolers to young children and included both old and new content. The logo featured six blocks (3 across, 2 down) with the top row lettered \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\", and the bottom row featuring an apple, a bee and a carrot beneath their respective letter. =2001‚Äì2003: ABC Kids and Fly TV channels= In 2001, the ABC For Kids timeslot was rebranded as ABC Kids and content was expanded to include shows for older children as well as younger children. A new logo, was also introduced, featuring a solid green Lissajous curve (taken from the ABC's logo) overlaid with \\"ABC Kids\\" in lowercase blue letters. In addition to the daily broadcasting block on the ABC, a new children's channel with the ABC Kids branding commenced transmission nationally on 1 August 2001 on channel 21, becoming ABC Television's first digital multichannel service. The service was officially inaugurated by former ABC Managing Director, Jonathan Shier, at the Australian Parliament House in Canberra on 7 August 2001. The ABC launched the channel without additional funding, hoping that its success would prompt an additional government grant. ABC Kids was broadcast from 6:00am to 6:00pm, with the remaining broadcasting time occupied by its sister service, Fly TV. Fly TV was launched on 1 November 2001 to feature programming aimed at teenagers and young adults and broadcast a 6-hour block from 6:00pm to 12:00am, which was repeated again from 12:00am to 6:00am. In addition to their availability on free-to-air television, the ABC Kids and Fly TV channels were also available on Austar channel 14 and Optus TV channel 21. The ABC Kids and Fly TV channels were discontinued on 30 June 2003 in the first of a series of cuts to save around A$25 million a year for the ABC. The ABC could not secure government funding to keep the channel on-air, and the sluggish uptake of digital television in Australia at the time made justifying a digital-only channel with a low viewership against the cost of keeping the channel on air difficult. However, the ABC Kids brand still remained throughout this period on the ABC's daily children's broadcasting block. After the close of the ABC Kids and Fly TV channels, programming for younger Fly TV viewers was integrated into the ABC Kids broadcasting block. =2003‚Äì2009: ABC Kids channel= =2009‚Äì2015: Split between two channels= In 2009, two daily blocks of children's programming were launched as ABC For Kids, running from 8:00am to 11:00am and 2:55pm to 4:00pm on ABC. From 2 May 2009, a new preschool children's block, ABC For Kids on 2 was launched on ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôABC2‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô (now ABC Comedy) in 2009‚Äì2011, featuring children's programming everyday until 6pm. Some ABC2 programmes had to be cancelled or relocated to other channels, such as Rage. The classic ABC For Kids logo from 1991 was rendered in 3D when the ABC for Kids name was revived. =2011‚Äìpresent: Part-time channel refocus= On 2 May 2011, all children's programming was removed from the main ABC channel and was divided between the ABC2 children's block and ABC3 (now ABC Me). The ABC2 children's block was rebranded as ABC4 Kids and was refocused as a part-time channel for preschoolers sharing the same bandwidth of ABC2 between 6am and 7pm. A new logo based on the ABC3 logo was also introduced. Broadcasting of the channel was rescheduled to begin at 5am instead of 6am on 7 July 2014. On 2 March 2015, the name of the channel was changed to ABC Kids and a new logo inspired by the classic children's logo was unveiled. Within the rebrand of ABC Comedy on 4 December 2017, broadcasting of the channel was rescheduled to end at 7:30pm instead of 7pm.https://www.facebook.com/ABCKIDSForParents/videos/1964900853536786/ The channel again received a new logo and look on 17 March 2020, introducing three animated characters based on the classic logo (an apple, a bee and a crocodile named Croc, instead of a carrot).

The interface includes a 3D modeler with all the capabilities required for the representation of any system. Application areas include: high energy physics and nuclear experiments, medical, accelerator and space physics studies. The software is used by radiation engineers around the world.  History  This is a radiation tool dedicated to the analysis and design of radiation sensitive systems. The project was created in 1999 and has constantly been improved since. This software can be applied to any radiation related field. The radiation hardness assurance of satellite manufacturers has been continuously improved over the last decade. The optimization of space systems in terms of either mechanical design to increase the ratio power/mass or miniaturization of electronic devices tends to increase the sensitivity of those systems to the space radiation environment. In order to mitigate the impact on the radiation hardness process, the first solution is to replace the rough shielding analysis by an accurate estimate of the real radiation constraint on the system. This corresponds to the solution provided by Fastrad for the deposited dose estimate. The main goal of this software is to reduce the margins stemming from a conservative approach of estimating radiation analysis, all the while reducing the cycle time of mechanical design changes for shielding optimization. In some cases, it can be used to justify the use of non rad-hard parts and saves cost and planning for space program equipment. Its features allow use of CAD import files and/or 3D viewing and geometry construction. For space applications, this software can consider a complete satellite model from the platform structure down to the electronic components. Radiation CAD interface This software is dedicated to engineers who do not necessarily have an extensive experience in CAD applications. This user-friendly interface was developed to construct 3D radiation models using simple functions. The main CAD capabilities of the tool are: * Creation of Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone and triangular Prism * Insertion of complex 3D geometries coming from STEP or IGES format files * Modelization tool set (clipping plane, 2D projection, measurement tool, colors, view shot,‚Ä¶) The core of the solution is the radiation 3D modeler. The goal of the engine is to make a realistic model of any mechanical design including material properties. The main part of the interface is devoted to the display window where the user can manipulate the geometry. The 3D solids can be defined either by using the component toolbar or by importing them from other 3rd party software (CATIA, Pro/Engineer‚Ä¶) with the standard STEP or IGES format. The Open Cascade library included in Fastrad provides advanced visualization capabilities like cut operations, complex shape management, and STEP and IGES exchange format modules. The advanced STEP module allows you to import the hierarchy, name and color information. The full 3D designer model is then managed by Fastrad (visualization, radiation calculation, post-processing). This software easily handles complex geometry and manages different length scales in the same model from the nanometer to 1024km. Fig. 1) Dialog boxes of the material definition module. An interactive periodic element table makes the material creation easier. A key element related to the radiation applications is the materials management. A dedicated user-friendly interface allows you to set the material properties of each solid of the 3D model, such as the density and the mass ratio of each element of the (compound) material by determining its chemical composition (see Fig. 1.). The list of predefined materials can be easily extended by the user. Another functionality is the detectors positioning. These detectors can be placed at any location in the model. In this way, radiation effects can be estimated at any point of the 3D model using a Monte Carlo algorithm for a fine calculation of energy deposition by particle-matter interaction (see ‚ÄúDose calculation and shielding‚Äù below), or for a ray-tracing approach. Moreover, the use of this software is compliant to late design changes and/or equipment re-use. For design changes, only the new files can be simply imported and/or modified in Fastrad. The processing of the sectorial analysis can then take place. Direct calculation of shielding efficiency using the user-friendly graphical interface can be performed and direct access to the masses of the different parts is possible to achieve shielding/mass increase trade-off. For equipment re-use, only the radiation environment data that is provided for deposited dose calculations has to be changed. At any time of the 3D modeling, the user can save his model with all the information (geometry, materials, detectors) defined during the current session. Several more helpful features (local frame display, interactive measurement tool, context menus,‚Ä¶) are included in the interface. The goal is to provide CAD software that can be used by engineers who want to minimize the modeling time in order to spend more time on radiation analysis. Dose calculation and shielding Once the 3D radiation model is done, the user can perform a deposited dose estimate using the sector analysis module of the software. This ray-tracing module combines the information coming from the radiation model with the information of the radiation environment using a Dose Depth Curve. This dose depth curve gives the deposited dose in a target material (mainly Silicon for electronic devices) behind an Aluminum spherical shielding thickness. This calculation is performed for each detector placed in the 3D model. Even for complex geometries, the efficient and rapid calculation provides two kinds of information: * the 3D distribution mass around each detector * the estimated deposited dose in an isotropic radiation environment Fig. 2) Screenshot of the FASTRAD tool during a complete satellite analysis (CNES courtesy) Using a post-processing of those results, Fastrad provides information about optimum shielding location using several viewing representation types. Figure 2. presents a mapping of the mass distribution viewed by one component of an electronic board. The red area indicates the critical directions in terms of shielding thickness. This helpful tool allows the user to optimize the size of additional shielding that can be used to decrease the received dose on the studied detector. The main advantage of this process is the short time needed to complete this task and the well defined mechanical shielding solution provided by the sector analysis post-processing. Monte Carlo algorithm The dose calculation in the software is particularly efficient with the Monte Carlo module (developed through a partnership with the CNES). This algorithm can be used either in a forward process or a reverse one. In the first case, the software manages the transport of electrons and photons (including secondary particles) from 1keV to 10 MeV, in the 3D model. Creation of secondary photons and electrons are taken into account. Any type of energy spectrum and source geometry can be defined. Sensitive volumes (SV) are selected by the user and Fastrad computes the deposited energy inside those SVs. The reverse Monte Carlo module is dedicated to the dose calculation due to an isotropic irradiation of electrons in a complex and multi-scale geometry. In this case, the forward algorithm can lead to huge computational times. The principle of the reverse method is to use (i) a forward particle tracking method in the vicinity of the SV and (ii) a backward particle tracking method from the SV to the external source. Fig. 3) Screen shot of the electron tracks during reverse Monte Carlo calculation on an electronic equipment. The Reverse Monte Carlo method for electron transport takes into account the energy deposition due to primary electrons and secondary photons. The Monte Carlo module was successfully verified through a comparison with GEANT4 results for the forward algorithm and with US Format for the reverse method. One example is the case of an electronic equipment in a satellite structure. The radiation environment corresponds to the electron energy spectrum of a geostationary mission (from 10 keV up to 5 MeV). This is a constantly evolving project. In the future, the Monte Carlo module will be able to manage protons and positrons. Interface to Geant4 Geant4 is a particle-matter interaction toolkit maintained by a worldwide collaboration of scientists and software engineers. This C++ library contains a wide range of interaction cross section data and models together with a tracking engine of particles through a 3D geometry. The Geant4 intuitive interface implemented in the Fastrad software provides a tool able to create the 3D geometry, define the particle source, set the physic list and create all the resulting source files in a ready to compile Geant4 project. This tool can be used either by young engineers who need to be driven into the Geant4 world and who can use Fastrad as a tutorial tool or by experts who do not want to spend time on the creation of C++ files that describe the geometry, material, and basic physics and who can use the Geant4 project created by Fastrad as a base that can be enhanced by specific features relative to their physical application. The Geant4 interface gives the software a wide range of radiation related fields, as Geant4 is already used for space, medical, nuclear, aeronautical and military applications. Its intuitive and powerful radiation CAD capabilities facilitate the engineering process for any radiation sensitive system analysis. Bunker Tool Another module is the bunker designer tool that calculates the concrete wall thickness of irradiation rooms by considering the room‚Äôs geometry, the type and activity of the source and the acceptable dose rate. Technical Specifications This software was developed using C++ with OpenGL to manage the 3D and Open Cascade library for the STEP import and Boolean operations. It was tested under Mac and LINUX using an OS emulator (PowerPC, VMware ‚Ä¶). Computer Requirements: Configuration: Windows Vista/XP/NT/2000 - 512 Mo RAM - 50 Mo HDD.

Ecology and attack The larvae is an agricultural pest that feeds on Cocos nucifera, Nypa fruticans, Elaeis guineensis, Musa species, and Phaseolus species. Usually the caterpillar attacks male flowers where infestation causes abortion of young and results in underdeveloped fruits. A severe attack can wilt the plant and delay plant development. They are not borers, and only show external feeding. Control Living specimen Biological control is the most effective method of controlling both larval and egg stages. Many different strains of parasites and pathogens are used, such as the entomoparasitic nematode Steinernema feltiae. The pathogens such as Beauveria bassiana, and Metarhizium anisopliae are also used in many regions. Agrophylax basifulva, a tachinid fly, is a known parasitoid used in Fiji.

He started his career under the warlord Sun Quan, who controlled the territories in the Jiangdong region in the late Eastern Han dynasty, and was appointed as the Chief () of Yuyao County () during this time. When a plague broke out in Yuyao County and caused the prices of provisions to skyrocket, Zhu Huan opened the county office's granary and distributed food supplies to the people. At the same time, he also ordered his subordinates to distribute medical supplies to the people affected by the plague.(ÂæÄÈÅáÁñ´ÁôòÔºåË∞∑È£üËçíË≤¥ÔºåÊ°ìÂàÜÈÉ®ËâØÂêèÔºåÈö±Ë¶™ÈÜ´Ëó•ÔºåÈ§êÁ≤•Áõ∏ÁπºÔºåÂ£´Ê∞ëÊÑüÊà¥‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 56. As a result, Zhu Huan gained the respect and recognition from the local population. Later on, Sun Quan appointed him as a Colonel () to lead 2,000 troops to find the people who had scattered earlier to avoid the plague. Zhu Huan succeeded in his mission and managed to resettle 10,000 people in Wu and Kuaiji commanderies after some years of effort. Middle career From the late 200s to around 222, Zhu Huan did not receive any important responsibilities while most of Sun Quan's other military officers actively participated in battles against rival warlords, particularly Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the Han central government and the lands north of the Yangtze River. During this time, he quelled rebellions in Danyang () and Poyang () commanderies while his colleagues were fighting at the frontlines. In recognition of Zhu Huan's success in suppressing the revolts, Sun Quan enfeoffed Zhu Huan as the Marquis of Xincheng Village () and promoted him to the rank of Major-General ().(Ê°ìÁù£È†òË´∏Â∞áÔºåÂë®ÊóãËµ¥Ë®éÔºåÊáâÁöÜÂπ≥ÂÆö„ÄÇÁ®çÈÅ∑Ë£®Â∞áËªçÔºåÂ∞ÅÊñ∞Âüé‰∫≠ÂÄô„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 56. Battle of Ruxu In 222, Zhu Huan succeeded Zhou Tai as the area commander of the fortress at Ruxu (), a strategic location at the border along the Yangtze River between Eastern Wu and its rival state Cao Wei. Around the time, the Wei emperor Cao Pi had launched a three-pronged invasion of Wu and ordered his general Cao Ren to lead the attack on Ruxu. Cao Ren purposefully leaked the news that he would attack Xianxi () with the intention of diverting the defenders' attention away from Ruxu fortress. Zhu Huan fell for Cao Ren's ruse and sent the bulk of his troops eastward to reinforce Xianxi. At the same time, Cao Ren led his several tens of thousands troops to attack Ruxu, where Zhu Huan had only 5,000 troops to guard the fortress.(È≠è‰ΩøÂ§ßÂè∏È¶¨Êõπ‰ªÅÊ≠•È®éÊï∏Ëê¨ÂêëÊø°È†àÔºå‰ªÅÊ¨≤‰ª•ÂÖµË•≤ÂèñÂ∑û‰∏äÔºåÂÅΩÂÖàÊèöËÅ≤Ê¨≤Êù±ÊîªÁæ®Ê∫™ÔºõÊ°ìÂàÜÂÖµÂ∞áËµ¥Áæ®Ê∫™ÔºåÊó¢ÁôºÔºåÂçíÂæó‰ªÅÈÄ≤ËªçÊãíÊø°È†à‰∏ÉÂçÅÈáåÂïè„ÄÇÊ°ìÈÅ£‰ΩøËøΩÈÇÑÁæ®Ê∫™ÂÖµÔºåÂÖµÊú™Âà∞ËÄå‰ªÅÂ•ÑËá≥„ÄÇÊôÇÊ°ìÊâã‰∏ãÂèäÊâÄÈÉ®ÂÖµÔºåÂú®ËÄÖ‰∫îÂçÉ‰∫∫) Sanguozhi vol. 56. The defenders were afraid because they were outnumbered, so Zhu Huan told them, \\"Whenever two armies fight, the outcome is determined by the commanders' will and not the size of the army. You have heard of Cao Ren's military reputation, so what do you think of his ability compared to mine? Military doctrine says that an invading force should be double the size of a defending force when they fight on flat ground. The condition is that the defenders are not in a fortress and the morale on both sides are equal. Now, Cao Ren is neither wise nor brave, his soldiers are fainthearted, and they are exhausted after travelling a thousand li. On the other hand, we occupy a high- walled fortress, which sits to the north of a river and south to a mountain. The situation is advantageous to us; we shall prevail over the tired invaders. We will win a hundred battles if a situation like this recurs a hundred times. We should have no fear even if Cao Pi comes here personally, so why should we worry about the likes of Cao Ren?\\"(Ë´∏Â∞áÊ•≠Ê•≠ÔºåÂêÑÊúâÊáºÂøÉÔºåÊ°ìÂñª‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö\\"Âá°ÂÖ©Ëªç‰∫§Â∞çÔºåÂãùË≤†Âú®Â∞áÔºå‰∏çÂú®ÁúæÂØ°„ÄÇË´∏ÂêõËÅûÊõπ‰ªÅÁî®ÂÖµË°åÂ∏´ÔºåÂ≠∞ËàáÊ°ìÈÇ™?ÂÖµÊ≥ïÊâÄ‰ª•Á®±ÂÆ¢ÂÄçËÄå‰∏ª‰∫∫ÂçäËÄÖÔºåË¨Ç‰ø±Âú®Âπ≥Âéü„ÄÇÁÑ°ÂüéÊ±†‰πãÂÆàÔºåÂèàË¨ÇÂ£´ÁúæÂãáÊÄØÈΩäÁ≠âÊïÖËÄ≥„ÄÇ‰ªä‰ªÅÊó¢ÈùûÊô∫ÂãáÔºåÂä†ÂÖ∂Â£´ÂçíÁîöÊÄØÔºåÂèàÂçÉÈáåÊ≠•Ê∂âÔºå‰∫∫È¶¨ÁΩ∑Âõ∞ÔºåÊ°ìËàáË´∏Ëªç„ÄÇÂÖ±ÊìöÈ´òÂüéÔºåÂçóËá®Â§ßÊ±üÔºåÂåóËÉåÂ±±ÈôµÔºå‰ª•ÈÄ∏ÂæÖÂãûÔºåÁÇ∫‰∏ªÂà∂ÂÆ¢ÔºåÊ≠§ÁôæÊà∞ÁôæÂãù‰πãÂã¢‰πü„ÄÇÈõñÊõπ‰∏ïËá™‰æÜÔºåÂ∞ö‰∏çË∂≥ÊÜÇÔºåÊ≥Å‰ªÅÁ≠âÈÇ™!\\") Sanguozhi vol. 56. Zhu Huan then ordered his subordinates to hide the flags and drums to generate an illusion they were weak, so as to lure Cao Ren to attack. Cao Ren sent his son, Cao Tai, to lead the main forces to approach the fortress and ordered Chang Diao and Wang Shuang to launch a sneak attack on Zhongzhou (an island in the middle of the river), where the defenders' families resided. Zhu Huan sent Yan Gui () to Zhongzhou to lay traps there, while he led the remaining troops out to battle Cao Tai. Chang Diao and Wang Shuang fell into an ambush and attempted to retreat, but their ships had been captured by the Wu forces so they could not head back. Chang Diao was killed in action while Wang Shang was captured. 1,000 Wei soldiers drowned when they attempted to flee, while the rest of the detachment were trapped.(Ê°ìÈÉ®ÂÖµÂ∞áÊîªÂèñÊ≤πËàπÔºåÊàñÂà•ÊìäÈõïÁ≠â...ÈÅÇÊ¢üÈõïÔºåÁîüËôúÈõôÔºåÈÄÅÊ≠¶ÊòåÔºåËá®Èô≥Êñ¨Ê∫∫Ê≠ªËÄÖÂçÉÈ§ò„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 56.

In recognition of Zhu Huan's achievements in the battle, Sun Quan promoted him to General of Uplifting Martial Might (), granted him the title \\"Marquis of Jiaxing\\" (), and appointed him as the nominal Chancellor of Pengcheng Commandery. Battle of Shiting Six years later, Zhu Huan participated in the Battle of Shiting as a subordinate under the command of Lu Xun. Zhu Huan once proposed to Lu Xun that they could easily capture the enemy general Cao Xiu by blocking the latter's retreat route with only 10,000 troops under his command. Lu Xun rejected Zhu Huan's plan and assigned him with 30,000 men to attack the enemy's flank. When Cao Xiu showed up at Shiting with 100,000 troops, Zhu Huan and Quan Cong led their men to attack Cao Xiu's left and right flanks while Lu Xun attacked when the enemy was thrown into disarray. Cao Xiu's troops scattered and their casualty count hit tens of thousands.(‰ºëÂπÖË£ÇÁì¶Ëß£ÔºåÊñ¨Áç≤Ëê¨Ë®à„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60. Death When Zhu Huan died in 238 at the age of 62 (by East Asian age reckoning), his family was so poor that Sun Quan had to provide financial aid to them to hold a decent funeral for Zhu Huan. This was because when Zhu Huan was still alive, he often used his personal wealth to help his subordinates and their (extended) families, which was why his family did not own much property and wealth by the time of his death. Zhu Huan's son, Zhu Yi, inherited his father's marquis title and served as a military officer in the Wu army.

It is organised by WindEurope (WindEurope) and GWEC (Global Wind Energy Council). It is a day when wind energy is celebrated, information is exchanged and adults and children find out about wind energy, its power and the possibilities it holds to change the world. In association with EWEA and GWEC, national wind energy associations and companies involved in wind energy production organise events in many countries around the world. In 2011, there were events organised in 30 countries, on 4 continents. Events included visits to onshore and offshore wind farms, information campaigns, demonstration turbines being set up in cities, wind workshops and a wind parade. Many events happened on Global Wind Day (15 June) itself, but there were also events on the days and weeks before and afterwards. In 2012 there were 250 events around the globe and a very popular photo competition. 2007 The inaugural year of Wind Day (it did not become Global Wind Day until 2009) was organised by EWEA. The main idea was to coordinate events organised by national wind energy associations and companies active in the wind energy field. Wind Day in 2007 reached 18 countries in Europe, with a participation of around 35,000 people. 2008 Wind Day 2008 reached 20 European countries and attracted 100,000 people. 2009 This was the first year that EWEA joined forces with GWEC and extended the reach from European wind energy associations and companies to coordinate Wind Day events across the globe (and changing the name to Global Wind Day). In 2009 there were 300 events in 35 countries, reaching 1 million people. In 2009 in Portugal the Wind Day was celebrated with an event called Wind Parade. It was organised in the city of Cascais just in front of the ocean. This project aimed to promote renewable energy good practices and in particular Wind Energy. It was supported by the City Council and conceived by Energia Lateral and implied the installation of 7 skstream micro wind turbines in a very visible place by the sea in June‚ÄìJuly 9. One of the purposes was to involve children in the event and they were invited for a contest to decorate/paint small dummy wind turbines. Over 50 applications were submitted by 30 schools. The winner decorated a dummy wind turbine with Don Quixote elements comparing his fight against the windmills but in this case the wind mills being allies of Don Quixote in an epic effort to improve the environment. 2010 In this year, 220 events took place in 30 countries, including the display of a 29.5 metre (96.7 ft) wind turbine blade in Brussels, Belgium, next to the main building of the European Commission and European Council. More than 1 million people were reached by Global Wind Day communications around the world. 2011 In Brussels, Belgium, the home of EWEA and GWEC, a wind parade in Place de Luxembourg educated people working in the EU area on the benefits and importance of wind energy. Global Wind Day events happened in 30 countries around the world in 2011. Some examples include: In France there were 15 events, ranging from wind farm inauguration to a jobs-in-the-wind-industry question and answer session. In Austria, journalists leapt from the top of a turbine and abseiled to the ground. In Japan there were 10 events, involving field trips to wind farms, experimental wind energy facilities and making wind turbines from a kit. In Australia, an open day at a wind farm was available, with a community evening to finish off the day. In Mexico, a public street fair featured a drawing competition for kids and a display of wind energy history. 2012 Global Wind Day partners organised 250 events around the globe in 2012, from wind farm open days to workshops, from photo exhibition to regattas, from kite-flying to charity runs. For the first time, this included events in Mexico, Chile, Israel, South Korea and South Africa. Global Wind Day 2012 gained the support of 18 GWD Ambassadors, who were joined by the Danish Presidency of the EU and the United Nations. Kandeh K. Yumkella, the Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the leader of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon‚Äôs Sustainable Energy for All initiative said, ‚ÄòWe need to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. This can be achieved with significant contribution from wind energy, both grid connected andfor small-scale decentralised systems. The ‚ÄòGlobal Wind Day‚Äô on 15 June, does play a central role in contributing to the UNSG‚Äôs Sustainable Energy For All initiative through galvanising the much needed support for the wind energy industry from political leaders around the globe‚Äô.

United States Olympic Committee, 483 U.S. 522 (1987), is a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States interpreting the trademark rights of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to regulate the use of the word \\"Olympic\\" under the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. (SFAA) attempted to organize a sporting events it called the Gay Olympic Games, and the USOC sought to enjoin the games under that name. SFAA claimed that the First Amendment overrode the rights that the Act gave the USOC to control the word Olympic. The Supreme Court rejected SFAA's First Amendment claim,. and the SFAA renamed its event the Gay Games. Background Historically, both the Olympic movement as well as the United States' participation evolved without government participation, with the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) coordinating the United States teams. However, the AAU was criticized for its actions. Accordingly, the United States Congress chartered a United States Olympic Committee and gave it exclusive rights to coordinate United States participation in international competitions. In addition, the Amateur Sports Act provided: > (a) Exclusive Right of Corporation.‚Äî Except as provided in subsection (d) of > this section, the corporation has the exclusive right to use‚Äî ... (4) the > words \\"Olympic\\", \\"Olympiad\\", \\"Citius Altius Fortius\\", \\"Paralympic\\", > \\"Paralympiad\\", \\"Pan-American\\", \\"America Espirito Sport Fraternite\\", or any > combination of those words.36 U.S.C. ¬ß 220506(a)(4). SFAA is a non-profit organization that sought to organize the \\"Gay Olympic Games\\" patterned after the Olympic Games. There were numerous other organizations that used \\"Olympics\\" in their name, including the Junior Olympics, Special Olympics, Eskimo Olympics, Police Olympics, and the Olympics of the Mind. SFAA used \\"Gay Olympics\\" on its letterheads and mailings, in local newspapers, and on various merchandise sold to cover the costs of the planned Games.483 U.S. at 525. The USOC asked SFAA to stop using the word \\"Olympics\\" to name its games, and SFAA refused.483 U.S. at 527. Proceedings below In August 1982, the USOC sued SFAA in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to enjoin the SFAA's use of the word \\"Olympic\\". The District Court granted a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction against SFAA shortly before the scheduled date of the first \\"Gay Olympics\\". The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court. After further proceedings, the District Court granted the USOC summary judgment and a permanent injunction as well as ordered SFAA to pay the USOC's attorneys fees. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court, but reversed the attorneys fee award, in a January 1986 ruling. It found that the Act granted the USOC exclusive use of the word \\"Olympic\\" without requiring the USOC to prove that the unauthorized use was confusing and without regard to the defenses available to an entity sued for a trademark violation under the Lanham Act. It did not reach the SFAA's contention that the USOC enforced its rights in a discriminatory manner (which it termed a \\"difficult issue\\") because the court found that the USOC is not a state actor bound by the constraints of the Constitution. The court also found that the USOC's \\"property righ[t] [in the word 'Olympic' and its associated symbols and slogans] can be protected without violating the First Amendment.\\"781 F.2d at 737. In April 1986, the Ninth Circuit denied the SFAA's petition for rehearing en banc. Three judges strongly dissented with that decision, finding that the panel's interpretation of the Act raised serious First Amendment issues.483 U.S. at 527-28. The SFAA appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court in August 1986. The arguments The Supreme Court granted certiorari;479 U.S. 913 (1986) it was the first explicitly homosexual rights case to be heard before the Court since 1967 in the pre-Stonewall era (although the Bowers v. Hardwick sodomy laws case had been heard the year before). The SFAA was represented before the court by openly gay San Francisco attorney Mary Dunlap. It was also represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. The USOC was represented by well-known Washington trial lawyer Edward Bennett Williams. During the March 24, 1987, oral arguments, the SFAA said it was denied use of the word \\"Olympic\\" due to its being a gay organization, and that the USOC as an agent of the U.S. government could not do so. Dunlap felt that she was likely to lose the case going in, a pessimism that increased when her planned line of argument was derailed by questioning from the bench. The decision The opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice Lewis F. Powell, joined by Justices William Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia. Justices Harry Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor joined in Parts I, II, and III of the opinion. Justice O'Connor joined by Justice Blackmun filed an opinion concurring and dissenting in part. Justice William J. Brennan filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall. In the 7‚Äì2 parts, the Court rejected arguments that the USOC's Congressionally-authorized legal rights over use of the word \\"Olympic\\" constituted a First Amendment violation. The Court additionally rejected the notion that the SFAA possessed a constitutional right to use the word \\"Olympics\\" as a verbal vehicle for portraying their view about the state of gays in America. In the 5‚Äì4 portion, the Court denied that the USOC had violated SFAA's right to equal protection under the laws via a discriminatory ban, vis √† vis there having been many other groups staging games of various kinds under the moniker \\"Olympic\\". As a defense, SFAA had claimed that an injunction was unwarranted because there was no likelihood of confusion between the Gay Olympics and the real Olympic Games. In response, the opinion found, the \\"legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended to provide the USOC with exclusive control of the use of the word 'Olympic' without regard to whether an unauthorized use of the word tends to cause confusion.\\"483 U.S. at 530. In general, the opinion found that the defenses that are normally available in Lanham Act cases do not apply to the trademarks protected by the Amateur Sports Act. The majority argued that the USOC and the Olympic movement had devoted considerable effort over time to build up the reputation of the Olympics that SFAA was trying to use.483 U.S. at 534. In rejecting SFAA's First Amendment claim because prohibiting the use of the \\"Olympics\\" did not prevent SFAA from conveying its message, the Court noted that SFAA was able to conduct its game under a different name.483 U.S. at 536. The dissent Justice O'Connor joined by Justice Blackmun filed an opinion concurring and dissenting in part. They had joined the first three parts of the majority opinion but dissented from Part IV that dealt with SFAA's claim that the injunction violated the Fifth Amendment because the USOC allowed other events to use the word \\"Olympics\\" but refused SFAA because the athletes were gay. The majority found that the government did not control how the USOC enforced its trademark rights and that the Fifth Amendment did not apply.483 U.S. at 544. However, O'Connor and Blackmun agreed with Brennan on the equal protection claim based on the Fifth Amendment.483 U.S. at 548 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Justice Brennan filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Marshall. The dissent argues that \\"The USOC performs a distinctive, traditional governmental function: it represents this Nation to the world community.\\"483 U.S. at 550 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The dissent also argued that the government forced the USOC to boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow was further evidence of the USOC being a state actor.483 U.S. at 552. The dissent also finds the trademark provision of the Act overly broad. \\"The statute is overbroad on its face, because it is susceptible of application to a substantial amount of noncommercial speech, and vests the USOC with unguided discretion to approve and disapprove others' noncommercial use of 'Olympic'.\\"483 U.S. at 561. The dissent views the injunction as violating SFAA's First Amendment rights. The dissent noted, \\"Here, the SFAA intended, by use of the word 'Olympic', to promote a realistic image of homosexual men and women that would help them move into the mainstream of their communities.\\" Preventing the SFAA from calling its games the \\"Gay Olympics\\" prevents the SFAA from expressing this idea.483 U.S. at 569. The dissent also argued that the Act regulated speech in a manner that was not content neutral. The Act allows the USOC to endorse particular non-commercial messages while prohibiting others.483 U.S. at 570. Accordingly, the dissent would have found for SFAA. Aftermath U.S. Olympic Committee headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A lawyer representing the SFAA rued the ruling, noting that \\"Olympics\\" had been applied to contests involving rats and cockroaches and saying, \\"I guess the moral is that if you're gay, in the next life you'd better be born a rat if you want to use the word 'Olympic'.\\" Based upon the earlier injunction, the SFAA had renamed its project, redoing its posters, literature, and T-shirts, and conducted the first Gay Games in San Francisco from August 28 to September 2, 1982. It drew 1,300 people from 12 countries. Gay Games II had taken place in August 1986, and indeed among the 3,500 athletes participating in it was SFAA attorney Dunlap, a goalkeeper. Former U.S. Olympian Tom Waddell, who was the founder of the Gay Games, died of AIDS complications on July 11, 1987, a few months after the Supreme Court decision. The Gay Games retains many similarities with the Olympics, including the Gay Games flame which is lit at the opening ceremony. The USOC issued \\"Guidelines for Using Olympic Symbols, Marks, and Terminology\\". Although the Gay Games have been conducted in many countries since 1982, they have not tried to use the word \\"Olympics\\" in those other countries. This is consistent with the existence of special trademark laws in countries other than the United States that also give special protection to the Olympic movement.For example, in Australia, Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 amended by the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Act 1994. In the years since the lawsuit, the Olympics and the Gay Games have set aside their initial hostilities and worked cooperatively together, successfully lobbying to have HIV travel restrictions waived for the 1994 Gay Games in New York and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A 2009 documentary film called Claiming the Title: Gay Olympics on Trial was created in the United States and was previewed at several film festivals. The subject was also included in a 2005 film by David Sector, called Take the Flame! Gay Games: Grace Grit & Glory.

It had an estimated magnitude of 7.4 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of about IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a massive landslide, blocking the Murghab River and forming the Usoi Dam, the tallest dam in the world, creating Sarez Lake. The earthquake and related landslides destroyed many buildings and killed about 100 people. Tectonic setting The earthquake epicenter is located in the central Pamir Mountains. These mountains form the western end of the Himalayan chain, caused by the continuing continental collision between the northward moving Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The area is affected by active faulting on both thrust faults and strike-slip faults. The 1911 earthquake occurred within the Pamir Hindu Kush seismic zone, which is regularly affected by earthquakes, some of which have magnitudes of 7 or greater. Characteristics The Usoi Dam caused by a landslide triggered by the earthquake. =Earthquake= The earthquake lasted for two minutes and was followed by an aftershock an hour later. The energy radiated by this event was one of the first to be estimated from seismograph recordings of seismic waves. Current estimates for the magnitude lie in the range 7.4-7.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale. The earthquake caused the waters of Lake Karakul to surge over its eastern rim, leaving behind a large sheet of ice as it withdrew. =Landslides= The earthquake triggered numerous landslides along the slopes of the Bartang, Tanimas and Murghab valleys. The largest of these blocked the Murghab river, forming the Usoi Dam and creating the Sarez and Shadau lakes. The Usoi landslide had an estimated volume of about 2 km3. The dam is the highest in the world at about 600 m, impounding a lake containing 17.5 km3 of water. The slide originated from a 4,500 m high mountain, falling 1,800 m to its present location. Damage The area of greatest damage extended along the Bartang River from Basid in the west continuing along the Murghab River to Sarez in the east, also involving the kishlaks of Barchidiv, Nisur, Sagnob, Rukhch and Oroshor. The Usoi landslide completely destroyed the Usoi kishlak. Estimates of casualties from the earthquake and related landslides range from 90 to 302. Aftermath The landslides and the formation of Sarez Lake caused significant migration of the inhabitants of the upper Bartang valley.

His public statement was made to a BBC Arabic Television team on a street in Riyadh in the presence of security forces.

Al-Johani is an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience . 11 March 2011 After the Arab Spring revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011, some protests took place in Saudi Arabia. A \\"Day of Rage\\" was proposed for Saudi Arabia for 11 March 2011. On that day, hundreds of people protested in Qatif, al-Awamiyah and Hofuf, but in Riyadh, the police presence was \\"overwhelming\\" by early in the morning, with large numbers of police cars present and helicopters that \\"crisscrossed the skies all day\\". Khaled al-Johani is the only person known to have participated in public street protests in Riyadh or Jeddah on that day. He walked past BBC Arabic Television journalists twice and both times was threatened by police that he would be imprisoned if he walked past the journalists, who were accompanied by state escorts, a third time.

We don't have dignity, we don't have justice!\\" He stated that there is no freedom of the press in Saudi Arabia, since it is an absolute monarchy, and that living a dignified life in Saudi Arabia depends on an individual's connection and the mercy of al-Saud princes.

Al- Johani had no access to a lawyer between his arrest and his 22 February court appearance. He was permitted to contact a lawyer following the court appearance. On 22 February, Philip Luther of Amnesty International criticised the trial, stating \\"The fact that he is appearing before a court that was originally established to handle terrorism-related charges only adds insult to injury.

He stimulated the other members to produce original music and was a key member in the Overkill quartet, having been a composer from the band's debut album Feel the Fire in 1985 to their most commercially successful album, The Years of Decay, in 1989. Accounts vary regarding Gustafson's split from Overkill in 1990: he was either fired by its founding members Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth and D. D. Verni or had left after Verni tried to remove him from the band via management. The feud between Gustafson and his former bandmates escalated again in March 2018, when Gustafson accused Ellsworth and Verni of not giving him his share of royalties for his songs with Overkill. Following the release of the second Overkill album Taking Over (1987), Gustafson was approached by Megadeth co-founder and band-leader Dave Mustaine to join his band, following trouble with their lineup at the time. However, Gustafson rejected the proposal, feeling that Overkill was turning big. Immediately after the split with Overkill, Gustafson went on tour with Cycle Sluts from Hell in Europe. Gustafson later tried to form a side-project with Exodus drummer Tom Hunting called I4NI. He was also a member of Grip Inc., but did not record anything with them. He played in the industrial metal band Skrew album Shadow of Doubt in 1996, replacing their guitarist for the recording of the album. He then relocated in Florida and left the music business for a while. Gustafson returned to the music industry in 2003 by joining the Florida-based band Response Negative, and has released two albums under the moniker Satans Taint: Axe to the Head of My Enemies (2017) and Destruction Ritual (2019). He has also worked for his family plumbing business in Florida. On January 27, 2020, it was announced that Gustafson would be temporarily filling in for Ray Vegas in Vio-lence. He was eventually confirmed as a permanent member of the band, and appeared on their first song in more than two decades, a cover of Dead Kennedys' \\"California √úber Alles\\". They are also currently working on a new EP.

It is in force. The Act reformed and substantially deregulated the law relating to agricultural tenancies, and has had the dual effects of increasing the amount of land available to rent in the agricultural sector, and increasing the average rent per acre charged. Background and history By the early 1990s, it was clear that the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 was not working. The 1986 Act had given security to agricultural tenants and held down rents, and the effect on landlords was so onerous that the amount of farmland available to let in the UK was declining by more than 50,000 acres a year.Williams et al. 2007, p. 19. A loophole in the law was found that enabled landlords to avoid the security of tenure conferred by the 1986 Act (Gladstone v Bower agreements), and by 1994 more than 70% of new agricultural tenancies used this loophole.Nix et al. 1999, p. 56. This held down the term of an agricultural tenancy to less than two years. But most farmland that fell vacant was not available to let at all: the landlords were often hiring contractors to farm it for them, or entering into share farming or partnership arrangements, rather than letting to the small businessman farmer. In February 1991, the MAFF (\\"Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\\", the body that later became DEFRA) published a consultation paper. The aim was to deregulate, simplify, and encourage the letting of land. In the proposals as originally drafted, there was to be no security of tenure, the Common Law on Notice to Quit would apply, and there would be near-complete freedom of contract. So for example, contractual provisions could override the statutory compensation due to tenants for improvements to the holding.Williams et al. 2007, p. 17. There was dissatisfaction from industry groups with this approach, and the detailed proposals published in September 1992 watered down the initial consultation document quite considerably. In December 1993, the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association, the Tenant Farmers Association and others issued their Joint Industry Statement setting out the consensus proposals for reform. It was this statement that formed the basis of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, which received royal assent on 9 May 1995. The RICS predicted that it would lead to 1 million extra acres becoming available for letting. Market garden land tenanted under the so-called Evesham Custom was given a specific exemption, as otherwise an outgoing tenant would not be able to offer a tenancy to an incomer on equivalent terms and security, this being one of the Custom's essential principles.Rodgers, C. Agricultural Law, Bloomsbury, 2015, p. 67 Effects Although the RICS' prediction of 1 million additional acres did not materialise, the decline in the amount of land available to let was halted and indeed there was a modest increase in supply. The 1995 Act seems to have caused land to be let for a shorter term and a higher rent.Nix et al. 1999, p. 60. The new kind of tenancy introduced in the 1995 Act is called a Farm Business Tenancy (\\"FBT\\") and since 1 September 1995, almost all new agricultural lettings have used this framework. However, tenancies created under the 1986 Act remain in force and unchanged by the subsequent legislation. The 1995 Act has been amended somewhat in the Regulatory Reform Order 2006. This has, in a modest way, streamlined, simplified and deregulated Farm Business Tenancies to an even greater extent. According to Williams et al. 2007, the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 changes agricultural tenancies in the following ways:Williams et al. 2007, p. 18. *No minimum term. *Little security of tenure. *Even if the tenant diversifies away from agriculture to a considerable extent, the tenancy will remain as a FBT. *Rent reviews every three years, unless the contract says otherwise. *The tenant can remove tenants' fixtures almost at will. *Compulsory compensation for tenant's improvements. *Dispute resolution is to be by alternative dispute resolution with arbitration as a fallback option. The 2006 reforms made the following further changes:Williams et al. 2007, p. 21. *No longer any need for a tenancy successor to earn a living from agricultural work on the holding. *Strictures on rent reviews and end of tenancy compensation are further relaxed. *Simplify the restructuring of holdings under a 1986 Act tenancy. *Removed the need to apply to an Agricultural Land Tribunal under certain circumstances. *Strictures on tenancy termination procedures are also further relaxed, provided the minimum period of 12 months is observed.

Sun's father was killed by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1927, and Sun was eventually adopted by Zhou Enlai, who later became the first premier of the People's Republic of China. While in Yan'an, Sun aroused the enmity of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, beginning a rivalry between the two that lasted throughout Sun's life until her ultimate death at Jiang's hands. During World War II, Sun lived in Moscow, studying theater. Lin Biao was also in Moscow at the time and proposed to Sun before returning to China in 1942, but Sun rejected him. Lin married another woman, Ye Qun, in 1943. Ye held a lifelong grudge against Sun for her earlier relationship with Lin. After the end of World War II, Sun returned to China and became active in acting and directing in Chinese theater. In 1950, shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sun was invited to become the director of the China Youth Art Theater, and married one of the most famous actors then in China the same year. Over the next several years Sun staged a number of performances that were critically well-received, some of which became famous across China. In 1956, Sun became the artistic director and vice-president of the Chinese Experimental Theater, staging a number of critically well-received plays over the next decade. When the Cultural Revolution occurred in 1966, Zhou Enlai sent Sun and her husband to work in Daqing to protect them from political persecution, but Jiang Qing and Ye Qun conspired to have Sun secretly arrested in 1968 while visiting Zhou Enlai in Beijing. Sun was sentenced without trial, and was tortured in a secret prison for several months before dying. After Sun died, Jiang Qing made arrangements for Sun's body to be cremated before an autopsy could be performed, and for her ashes to be disposed of before Zhou or Sun's other relatives could take possession of them. Sun's husband was not informed of Sun's death until his release, in 1975. Biography =Family background= Sun's father, Sun Bingwen, was recruited by Zhou Enlai to join the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Germany,Barnouin and Yu 125. and subsequently became a close friend of both Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. After studying abroad in the Soviet Union, Sun Bingwen returned to China in 1924 and joined the faculty of Whampoa Academy.Lee and Stephanowska 497 In 1926, Sun was appointed the General Secretary of the General Political Department of the National Revolutionary Army. After the relationship between the KMT and CCP deteriorated Sun Bingwen was arrested on April 16 1927 and executed four days later, during the White Terror. When Sun Bingwen died Sun Weishi was only six years old.Xiandai Sun (center) with her mother Ren Rui (left) and aunt Ren Jun Following her father's death, Sun Weishi's mother, Ren Rui, took the family into exile, raising Sun Weishi and her three siblings alone while participating in CCP underground work. In 1935, when Sun was only fourteen, Sun's mother entrusted her to a leftist acting troupe based in Shanghai. In order to hide her identity and keep her safe, Sun's name was changed to \\"Li Lin\\" until 1937. Zhang 1 Ren Rui died on April 11, 1949, reportedly due to illness from overwork. Sun Weishi had three siblings, one sister and two brothers. One of Sun Weishi's brothers, Sun Yang, was imprisoned with his father in 1927, when he was only twelve. Sun Yang was eventually released, became Zhu De's personal assistant, and became the president of Renmin University after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1967 Jiang Qing accused Sun Yang of being a spy for the Soviet Union, the Japanese, and the Kuomintang, and Sun Yang was tortured and killed by Maoist Red Guards in the basement of his own university. Sun Weishi's other brother, Sun Mingshi, died in combat fighting for the CCP against the KMT. Sun's sister, Sun Xingshi, taught at the Foreign Languages Department at Peking University. In 1975 Sun Xingshi married Sun Weishi's widower, Jin Shan, who had been imprisoned throughout the Cultural Revolution for his association with Sun Weishi. =Joining the Chinese Communist Party= Sun (left) with her aunt Ren Jun In 1937, when she was only sixteen, Sun traveled to Wuhan to request permission to travel to the Communist base in Yan'an, but was refused due to her youth and lack of political connections. Sun's father's old friend, Zhou Enlai (who was childless), found Sun crying outside of the Eighth Route Army Liaison Office, and promptly adopted Sun as his daughter. With Zhou's assistance, Sun was able to travel to Yan'an, and promptly joined the CCP in 1938. After arriving in Yan'an, Sun was introduced to Mao Zedong and Zhou's wife, Deng Yingchao, and got along well with them both. Lin Biao was rumored to have developed a romantic interest in Sun while they were both in Yan'an, but Sun did not reciprocate due to Lin's age.Zhang 2 In Yan'an Sun enrolled in the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University with her mother, and became active in theater.Lee and Stephanowska 497‚Äì498 Jiang Qing, when she was single and new to Yan'an, once auditioned for a play with Sun. Jiang was given a minor role, while Sun was given the lead. In comparison to Jiang, Sun was compared as being a far superior actress, more attractive, and seven years younger. Jiang never went onstage again.Terrill 118‚Äì119 Soon after arriving in Yan'an, Jiang began a romantic affair with Xu Yixin, a senior teacher at Lu Xun College, and fell in love with him. Xu soon became infatuated with Sun Weishi, and Sun reciprocated this affection. Jiang's jealousy over Sun's acting ability, and Sun's ability to attract men that Jiang was also attracted to, was the beginning of a long-lasting hatred that Jiang held for Sun. =Education in Moscow= Sun and Zhou in Moscow, 1939. Sun accompanied Zhou Enlai to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1939, when Zhou flew to Moscow to seek medical treatment for a broken arm. Sun accompanied Zhou as his personal assistant, and studied Russian in her spare time. Sun remained in the Soviet Union when Zhou returned to China in 1940, studying theater at Moscow Oriental University. In 1937 Lin Biao was injured in an incident with the army of Yan Xishan, flew to Moscow for medical attention, and remained there until 1942. Before returning to China Lin proposed to Sun and promised to divorce his wife, from whom Lin was estranged. Sun was not able to accept Lin's proposal, but promised to consider marrying Lin after completing her studies. Lin divorced his wife after returning to China in 1942, and married another woman, Ye Qun, in 1943. The relationship between Sun and Ye was notably bad. Sun completed her studies and returned to China in September 1946, and participated in the land reform movement in Shanxi. Sun then joined the cast of a traveling theater group, performing in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei. In 1949, Sun was the head of the interpreting team that accompanied Mao Zedong on his state visit to the Soviet Union.Lee and Stephanowska 498 After Sun returned to China, Jiang Qing, who was now Mao's wife, continued her rivalry with Sun. =Early artistic career= Sun (right) with Zhou (left) and Deng Yingchao Shortly after Sun returned to China, in the spring of 1950, Liao Chengzhi invited Sun to become the artistic director of the China Youth Art Theater, which he had founded. Sun enthusiastically accepted, and began work on establishing the first professional theater to stage shows in colloquial Mandarin in the PRC. The first play that Sun directed was How Steel is Made, a play based on a Russian novel written by Nikolai Ostrovsky. How Steel is Made, based on its author's own experiences, was a story about a revolutionary named Pavel Korchaghin who had been crippled while fighting in a revolutionary war, but who eventually overcame great difficulties to become a successful writer. The play was extremely successful, and is considered the first example of modern spoken drama produced in the PRC. The lead character of Pavel (played by Jin Shan) became a household name in China during the early 1950s. In 1952 Sun produced \\"the most successful foreign classic ever mounted on the PRC Stage\\", Gogol's the Inspector-General. In 1952 Sun also produced a play in celebration of the founding of the Children's Art Theater, Little Rabbit. Little Rabbit was made into a film by the Beijing Film Studio in 1953, and is still considered one of the best children's plays ever produced in the PRC.Lee and Stephanowska 499 In 1954, on the fiftieth anniversary of Anton Chekov's death in 1904, Sun produced one of Chekov's plays, Uncle Vanya, in collaboration with a Soviet expert. From 1954 to 1956, Sun also worked as the principal instructor of directors with the China Central Drama College. During the 1950s Sun also translated numerous other foreign plays, including, the Servant of Two Masters. One of the plays she directed during this period was based on the life of Princess Wencheng. =Marriage= Sun (right) with her husband Jin Shan Following the production of How Steel is Made, Sun Weishi began a romantic affair with Jin Shan, who had played the male lead, Pavel. The affair caused a controversy within Communist circles when it became public, since Jin was still married to actress Zhang Ruifeng at the time. The two eventually married on 14 October 1950, after Jin divorced his wife, Zhang Ruifang, a famous actress who played Pavel's lover in the play. By the time that Sun and Jin met, Jin was already a famous film and theater actor, \\"the Clark Gable of the Shanghai stage\\".Terrill 120 When he was young, Jin was adopted by the Shanghai gangster Du Yuesheng, and encouraged to join the Communist Party in order to facilitate collaboration between the CCP and the Green Gang. In the 1930s Jin became an agent of Zhou Enlai, and gathered information for the Communists. During the Second Sino-Japanese War Jin toured areas of China not controlled by the Japanese, staging patriotic anti-Japanese plays.Zhang 3 Sun and Jin were married on October 14 2020 at the Beijing Youth Palace. Sun's wedding gift from Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao was a copy of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. Jing Qing gave her a pair of embroidered quilts. Shortly after his marriage to Sun, Jin was sent to the camp of Kim Il-sung to stage a play for Communist soldiers serving in the Korean War. While in Kim's camp, Jin was accused of having an affair with one of Kim's female secretaries. When Kim discovered the affair he had the secretary shot, and turned Jin over to the commander of the Chinese forces, Peng Dehuai. Peng sent Jin back to Beijing with the recommendation that Jin be executed. In the end, Jin was briefly imprisoned and expelled from the CCP, but was saved from execution through the intervention of Sun and Zhou. =Late artistic career= From left: Sun Weishi with Deng Yingchao, Zhou Enlai and her younger sister Sun Xingshi In 1956 Sun became the artistic director and vice-president of the newly created Chinese Experimental Theater. While working with the Experimental Theater, Sun attempted to create a new style of socialist art by combining Stanislavsky's system with dramatic techniques found in traditional Chinese opera. In June 1956 Sun produced the play Joys and Sorrows, a drama about a romantic triangle between a CCP official and two women. The play was warmly received for its verisimilitude, portraying CCP officials as prone to the same weaknesses as other people. Because Joys and Sorrows focused on the personal life of a CCP leader, both it and Sun were criticized during the Anti-Rightist Movement of 1957, initiated by Mao in order to persecute those potentially critical of him. Sun Weishi (1964) In 1957 Sun produced her second play for the Chinese Experimental Theater, Peach Flower Fan, a period play in which Sun utilized features of Chinese opera and folk dance. In 1957 Sun also produced a comedy, Portrait of One Hundred Clowns, in order to defend herself against her political critics by shallowly promoting the Anti-Rightist Movement. In 1961 Sun produced a play, the Hatred of Black Slaves, based on the American novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. In the Hatred of Black Slaves Sun experimented with techniques found in Chinese opera (the same which had inspired Brecht's concept of \\"alienation effects\\") in an effort to break down the \\"fourth wall\\". The Hatred of Black Slaves was notable for its attempts to expand the play's dramatic action beyond the confines of the stage.Lee and Stephanowska 499‚Äì500 After the success of the Hatred of Black Slaves, Zhou Enlai directed Sun to produce a play portraying the heroic deeds of oil workers in Northeast China. Sun and her husband, Jin Shan, moved to the oil city of Daqing and worked for several years with oil workers and their wives, eventually producing the play the Rising Sun. The plot of the Rising Sun focused on the contributions that women made in agriculture and the construction of oilfields, and featured a cast made up exclusively of local people. The play was well received in Daqing, Beijing, and Shandong. Encouraged by the play's success, Sun and Jin returned to Daqing in order to produce more plays based on oil workers, but were not able to complete their work before the advent of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. The Rising Sun was the last play that Sun would ever produce.Lee and Stephanowska 500 In 1963, while directing the play \\"Azalea Mountain\\", Jiang Qing approached Sun and asked if she could be involved in the production of the play. Sung rejected Jiang's request, saying that, since the play was being produced by the Youth Theatre, it wouldn't be appropriate. The Rising Sun (1965) was the first time in the history of Chinese drama that experts and the public collaborated to create art. Due to the influence of the Cultural Revolution in China in the 1960s, Sun Weishi worked hard to understand and explore the theme of that particular social period and sought to show the unique spiritual outlook and relationship between people under dramatic social change. She pursued the significance of women and female rights in the context of turbulent social development, a vital element of her creation. The Rising Sun has the characteristics of political and gender representation, making the work not only reflect the distinctive features of her time but also enriching the public image of women. The play includes numerous female characters, which was rare in the 1960s. =Political persecution and death= When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Zhou Enlai's power became circumscribed, while Jiang Qing gained power. Although Zhou still held the formal position of premier, he was not able to prevent the arrest of Sun or even his own brother, and personally signed their arrest warrants in fear of angering Mao. After forcing Zhou to sign Sun's warrant, Jiang ordered officers from the Air Force (loyal to Lin Biao, Jiang's ally) to arrest and secretly imprison Sun, so that Zhou could not intervene to protect her. Sun Weishi and Jin Shan were both imprisoned on March 1 1968. After Sun's arrest Jiang confiscated and burned many of Sun's personal belongings, and arranged for Sun's name to be officially changed to \\"Â≠ô‰º™Â£´\\" (\\"Sun, the Hypocrite\\", which sounds like \\"Sun Weishi\\"). Jiang gave orders that Sun be sentenced without trial, and directed that Sun be tortured at leisure, but not killed.Zhang 4 After being imprisoned, Sun Weishi was tortured for seven months, and eventually died in prison on October 15, 1968. Her body was found naked with her arms and legs still shackled. There were no female guards in the prison. Interviews with a guard a decade later implied that \\"higher-ups\\" had ordered her to be repeatedly raped. Two other prisoners gave an account of seeing the guards handing Sun over to several male convicts in the prison to be raped. These accounts match written or eyewitness accounts of other female prisoners who were tortured to death in the era, notably Zhang Zhixin and Lin Zhao. After hearing of Sun's death and her condition at the time of her death, Zhou Enlai ordered an autopsy, but Jiang intervened and had Sun's body quickly cremated. After cremating Sun's body, Jiang had her ashes disposed of, in order to prevent Sun's family from taking possession of them.Zhang 5 Jin remained in prison until his release in 1975, after the Cultural Revolution ended. Jin was not informed of Sun's death until after his release. After Jin's release, the Rising Sun was re-staged as part of a larger criticism of the Gang of Four, who many blamed for Sun's persecution and death. The occasion of the play's first staging after 1975 was reported as being particularly solemn. Following the end of Cultural Revolution, she was posthumously rehabilitated in June 1977. On June 9, 1977, a statue of Sun Weishi was placed in memory of her at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing by the Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China. In 2012, on the 91st anniversary of her birth, Xinhua published a biographical book about her, Innocent Heart. The book consists of memories and articles of Sun Weishi, from her relatives, people and artists who collaborated with her. On December 26th, 2012, the National Theatre Company of China held a press conference regarding her biography, Innocent Heart, to memorize Sun Weishi and her 91st birthday. In the press conference the National Theatre Company stated that it considered Sun one of the three greatest directors in the history of People's Republic of China.Ifeng Entertainment Footnotes References *Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

It was run by the Speedway Riders' Association of South Australia and ran from 1981 until its forced closure in 1997. History =Early Years= North Arm Speedway was South Australia's first dedicated senior Solo and Sidecar track. Previous tracks (other than the Wayville Showgrounds in the late 1920s and early 1930s which ran before car speedway became popular) in both Adelaide and around the state had generally catered to both bikes and cars. The speedway was opened on Sunday 26 July 1981, by the Speedway Riders' Association on land owned by the South Australian Government. Following the closure of Rowley Park Speedway in April 1979, the only Dirt track racing venue in Adelaide was the new Speedway Park, which has a clay surface, something that suited the increasingly popular car racing, but not motorcycle speedway. Despite the bikes racing in the early years at Speedway Park, the nearest speedway to Adelaide which suited bike racing was some 80 km away at the Riverview Speedway in Murray Bridge, which during the speedway season (generally October to April) only ran meetings every second Saturday night. With many of South Australia's riders based in Adelaide, the decision was made to build a motorcycle only venue in Adelaide with a Dolomite surface where weekly meetings could be run. The track itself was approximately in length, which while considered small by Australian track standards (when it was built, most Aussie speedways were usually 350-550m in length as most run cars as well as bikes with Speedway Park itself being long), it was roughly the same length as most tracks in Britain where most of the top riders rode professionally. The safety fence was a 2m high chain mesh fence on top of a 1 ft high wooden retaining fence. Lights were eventually installed for night meetings in 1985, although spectator capacity was only around 5,000 (more with extra seating for Australian Championship meetings). Due to North Arm's relatively small spectator capacity, and its lack of lights for night racing, both the Australian Sidecar Championship and the Australian Solo Championship were awarded to Speedway Park with its capacity to comfortably hold over 10,000 spectators in both 1982 and 1983 respectively. =Move to Friday Nights= When it first opened North Arm Speedway held regular Sunday afternoon meetings so as not to compete with Speedway Park which ran Friday nights and had the bikes on the program, and also to avoid clashing with meetings at the Riverview Speedway. South Australian riders would regularly race three days per week at home, something most experienced when racing in the British Leagues during the Australian winter months. After the 1984/85 season, bikes were off the program at Speedway Park following safety concerns after the death of rider Kevin O'Connell on 25 January 1985. O'Connell had been killed after he hit the speedway's concrete retaining wall which offered no protection to riders or passengers. With the bikes no longer competing at Speedway Park, lights were installed at North Arm in 1985 and the speedway began holding regular Friday night meetings from 1985/86 which lasted until the speedway's closure. During the winter of 1986 the pits at North Arm were also re-located. Originally they were outside the back straight but were moved to outside of the front straight behind the control tower (which also incorporated the announcers box). The old pits became car parking while Turn 3 for the solo's (Turn 2 for the sidecars) became known as the Old Pits Corner. =Championships and International Meetings= From 1983 until it closed in 1997 North Arm became the regular host of the South Australian Solo and Sidecar championships, hosting the Solo title 10 times. The only other tracks to host the SA Solo title during this period were the Westline Speedway in Whyalla (1986/87) and Riverview Speedway (1984/85, 1987/88, 1990/91). North Arm hosted the 1992 Australian Solo Championship, where a capacity crowd of over 6,000 fans saw Leigh Adams from Victoria win the first of a record 10 national championships (a temporary grandstand was erected on the outside of turn 1 for the expected attendance). Adams set a track record in the 2nd heat of the night with a time of 58.74 seconds for the 4 lap race. The record he broke had been set in Heat 1 of the championship by reigning South Aussie Champ Craig Hodgson who won in a time of 59.11 seconds. Leigh Adams won with 14 points from North Arm's own Shane Parker on 13 and Queensland's Mark Carlson third on 11 points. This meeting also saw the crash which almost ended the career of Australia's former World #3 from 1990, Todd Wiltshire who suffered a multiple back injuries and broken pelvis which force him to retire at age 23 though he did make a successful comeback in 1997. Wiltshire, battling with Jason Lyons for the lead going into the last turn of Heat 3, tried a pass on the outside and went down, sliding into the wooden safety fence which broke around a light pole (placed outside the fence) on impact in the old pit corner. Unfortunately during its 16-year life span, North Arm was never awarded the right to host the Australian Sidecar Championship, although it did host some of Australia's richest Sidecar meetings. North Arm Speedway's spectator capacity was pushed to the limit on a number of occasions including test Matches between Australia with riders such as Phil Crump, Todd Wiltshire, Leigh Adams and local riders Shane Parker, Scott Norman and Shane Bowes taking on visiting 'teams' such as a \\"Rest of the World\\" team in 1990 including Gary Havelock of England, Mitch Shirra of New Zealand, and Shawn Moran of the United States (while the injured Sam Ermolenko was guest commentator on the night). In 1991 Australia faced a powerful Swedish team led by 1990 World Champion Per Jonsson, former dual Ice Racing World Champion Erik Stenlund, as well as 1990 World finalists Jimmy Nilsen and Henrik Gustafsson and 1988 World Under-21 Champion Peter Nahlin (who was the Swedish reserve on the night). The Swede's also had in their riding lineup a young rider who was not only the reigning Swedish Champion, but the rider would go on equal Ivan Mauger's six Speedway World Championships, the great Tony Rickardsson. Both the 1990 and 1991 test matches attracted 4,000 and 4,800 fans respectively, well up on previous crowd figures for the speedway. It was the success of those two international meetings which led to the speedway being awarded the 1992 Australian Solo Championship. The 1990/91 season also saw the first, and so far only tour of Australia by the official USSR team, who while not facing Australia in a test, faced state teams and various other 'select' teams while on tour. They faced a South Australian Select team in their visit to North Arm on 28 December 1990 with the locals, strengthened by 'ring-ins' Dennis L√∂fqvist from Sweden and David Norris from England (resident North Arm international riders) defeating the Russians 53‚Äì37 in a match closer than the score suggests. Actual local riders Shane Bowes (team captain) and Shane Parker top scored for the 'SA' with 13 and 8 points respectively while Oleg Kurguskin with 11 and the late Rif Saitgareev with 10 points top scored for the Russians. During its lifetime North Arm was also the Australian base for various international riders racing in the Australian Speedway season with riders such as Shawn Moran (USA), Vesa Ylinen of Finland, Dennis L√∂fqvist from Sweden and David Norris from England all basing themselves in Adelaide. North Arm was also the Australian base for two future Speedway World Champions. Twenty-year-old Gary Havelock from England (the 1992 World Champion) spent the 1987/88 Australian season based at North Arm, while 2010 World Champion Tomasz Gollob from Poland (along with his brother Jacek who made a number of appearances), made North Arm his Aussie home during 1994/95. While North Arm had its fair share of accidents, sometimes resulting in serious injury, no competitor was ever killed at the speedway or later as the result of a crash. Closing Following the 1996/97 Australian Speedway season (generally run between October and April), North Arm Speedway was closed when the South Australian Government reclaimed the land that the speedway was located on. This left Adelaide without an operating motorcycle speedway for the first time since 1926 when racing was first held at the Wayville Showground. Most of North Arm's track surface was then moved less than 2 km away to the new Gillman Speedway to form the base of a track that was used for daytime practice meetings until a larger track was built for race meetings before the current track was opened in 2000. Even though Friday night meetings at the track were held in summer, North Arm could actually be cold when the wind was blowing from the north or west (the track was located close to the marshlands and adjacent to the Port River and the Gulf St Vincent). The speedway also had spectator facilities which could be described average at best. Despite this, North Arm Speedway is fondly remembered by those who either rode there or were regular spectators. Present Day Today the site of North Arm Speedway shows nothing of its past as a speedway as industrial buildings now occupy the land. The last remnants of the speedway were removed in mid-2004 when what was left of the track itself was cleared and building starting in mid-2005. When looking on Google Earth at historic photos the start/finish line of the speedway was on the Grand Trunkway (road) side of the track, with the pit area located between the front straight and the road. Car parking for the speedway was in the area to the north of the track.

The windfarm is located south-east of North Tawton and south-west of Bow, and comprises nine wind turbines, each high. Developer Renewable Energy Systems (RES) received planning consent for the project in December 2009, following a long planning process which included two public inquiries and a judicial review. RES initially put forward proposals for a windfarm at Den Brook in 2004, and in response the Den Brook Valley Action Group was established to oppose the plan. A key concern was the potential impact of noise on local residents. In 2006, West Devon Borough Council refused planning permission for the scheme, but RES appealed, and consent was granted in early 2007 following a public inquiry. Still concerned about noise issues, local residents the formed Den Brook Judicial Review Group which pursued a judicial appeal. This resulted in the inquiry decision being overturned, and a second public inquiry was held in October 2009, following which permission was once more granted, subject to a number of planning conditions. A second legal challenge was rejected in August 2010. In 2011, the windfarm was the subject of a television documentary series, Windfarm Wars, broadcast by BBC Two, which followed the history of the project. Planning history RES initially publicised two alternate proposals for Den Brook in 2004: a scheme of ten turbines; and a scheme of 19 turbines. Following consultation, a layout of nine turbines was developed. Also in 2004, RES erected an anemometer mast to measure wind speed, and undertook background noise monitoring. =Planning application= By April 2005, Den Brook Valley Action Group (DBVAG) had been formed, and was flying a balloon at the site to mark the height of the proposed turbines. The planning application was submitted to West Devon Borough Council (WDBC) in November 2005. Objections to the proposal came from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Mid Devon District Council, and from 2,915 objection letters, all citing grounds including visual impact, noise, and residential amenity. Dartmoor National Park and the Dartmoor Preservation Association also objected, as the site is located around from the national park boundary. 71 letters of support were also received. WDBC planning officers recommended refusal of planning permission, on the grounds of visual impacts, and potential impacts on the historic environment. On 31 January 2006 the council voted to accept the recommendation, and refused planning permission. Four months later, RES announced their intention to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate against the decision, and to seek a public inquiry. The inquiry was held in November 2006, at which the appeal was opposed by representatives of WDBC and DBVAG. In February 2007 the appeal was allowed by the planning inspector, and planning permission granted. =Judicial review= In March 2007, the Den Brook Judicial Review Group (DBJRG) was formed by local residents. Headed by Mike Hulme, whose property was one of the closest dwellings to the proposed site, the group came together over concerns regarding the potential for noise pollution from the turbines. A key concern was the potential for sleep disturbance due to a phenomenon known as amplitude modulation. This form of noise, which has been reported at a small number of windfarm sites, is poorly understood. DBJRG launched an appeal, under Section 288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, to the High Court, which was heard in March 2008 by Justice Mitting. A key issue was the refusal of RES to release the background noise data to Mr Hulme, to allow independent analysis. Although he criticised the approach taken by RES, Justice Mitting refused to overturn the result of the inquiry, since the planning inspector had not made a legal error in coming to his decision. In May, RES released the noise data, and errors were subsequently discovered by DBJRG, although RES denied that they were significant. DBJRG then took their case to the Court of Appeal, and permission to appeal was granted in June 2008. To avoid the need for another court hearing a consent order was agreed between DBJRG and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (the defendant in the case), which had the effect of overturning the planning inquiry, and returning the matter to the Planning Inspectorate. =Second public inquiry= The second public inquiry was initially scheduled for March 2009, but was postponed at the request of DBJRG, who had not then had sufficient time to review new noise data supplied by RES. The inquiry took place between July and October 2009, with the appeal being opposed by WDBC, DBJRG, and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. The appeal was once again allowed in December 2009. A number of planning conditions were attached by the inspector, aimed at reducing the likelihood of noise nuisance. Following the decision, a second judicial appeal was launched by Mike Hulme, which challenged the validity of the planning conditions and claimed that the wording of the noise conditions rendered them ineffective. The case was heard by Judge Frances Patterson QC in July 2010. All ten grounds of the challenge were rejected by the judge in her decision. Hulme went on to lodge an appeal against this decision, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in May 2011. Subsequently, RES sought agreement with WDBC on how the planning conditions would be met. =Construction= Construction commenced in 2015. Windfarm Wars The BBC commissioned a documentary on the development of Den Brook Wind Farm shortly after the inception of the project. Including face-to-face interviews with a number individuals concerned with the windfarm, it focused primarily on Rachel Ruffle, project manager for RES, and Mike Hulme, local resident and member of DBJRG. Initially conceived as a single film, it developed into a series as the planning process became more and more protracted. The timescale also consumed most of the programme budget, with producer Jeremy Gibson eventually completing the films as a solo project. The series was first broadcast in May and June 2011.

James Craven (1935‚Äì1980) was an Irish poet. He was born at Balregan, outside of Dundalk, County Louth.  Life  Craven lived most of his life at his family home at Balregan. Despite having received an award for writing at the age of fifteen, he left school after completing his Intermediate Certificate exams. Throughout his life he was employed in various clerical and administrative jobs in Dundalk and briefly, in Dublin and Leeds. He was active in the Labour Party at grassroots level in the 1970s. Craven became something of a local legend during his lifetime, earning fame and infamy in equal measure, through frequent public poetry recitals and nightly carousing throughout Dundalk and its hinterlands. In his later years, Craven suffered from bipolar disease and alcoholism, spending intermittent periods in psychiatric care. He died in a car accident in 1980. The poet's self-penned epitaph, inscribed on his headstone at Brid-a-Crin cemetery near Dundalk, reads: :I‚Äôm not away :I shine in all your shaven :faces :Whisper through the :mystery of trees  Work  During his lifetime Craven produced a sizeable collection of work, the quality of which has been recognised by a number of distinguished commentators. Craven's poems were published locally, nationally and internationally in newspapers, periodicals and anthologies, at various points in his life. Two collections of his poetry, Selected Poems and Nice of You Jim, were published in 1983 and 2005 respectively. Craven's work was also included in Eugene Robert Platt's A Patrick Kavanagh Anthology in 1973 and Daniel J. Casey's Poetry of the C√∫chulainn Country in 1978. Craven was also involved in the Dundalk theatre scene, penning several plays and becoming a locally renowned actor.  Content and style  Craven's poetry deals with a number of subjects central to Irish writing of the time. He explores themes such as childhood, nature, rurality, sexuality, love, violence, religion, mythology and history. During the Troubles of the 1970s he wrote scathingly of the bloodshed that was occurring in Ireland at that time, believing it to be senseless and unjustified. Language, unbounded and malleable, is paramount to the work of Jim Craven and as the 'Bard of Balregan' he assumed the mantle of artistic preserver of the colloquialisms, nuances and the essence of his region. He employs a liberal amount of topography, citing townlands and focal points within the locale and creating a solid foundation and firm setting for his lines ‚Äì a 'mise-en-sc√®ne' of rural Irish life. In the preface to Nice of You Jim, Daniel J. Casey wrote of Craven: > \\"He was a unique talent‚Ä¶Impatient with the English language, he created > imagistic word magic and often drew on Irishisms to better catch the flavour > of the place. His rhythms, sometimes unorthodox, gave dimension to lyrics, > simple and complex. The style, perfectly echoes the voice.\\" His writing is also often tinged with both melancholy and mischief in equal measure. His reflections during times of depression serve as utterances of a severe sense of grief, self-loathing and solitude while his stinging satire spared no dimension of the social spectrum, parodying all whom he saw as deserving ‚Äì from priests and paupers to politicians and paramilitaries. It has been suggested, on occasion, that Craven's death at the age of forty-five, prevented the poet from reaching his artistic zenith. Nevertheless, the substantial literary corpus that he left behind him is testament to the distinctive and prodigious talent of a man that the Irish playwright John B. Keane once referred to as 'a totally dynamic genius'.  Recent  April 2010 saw the thirtieth anniversary of Jim Craven's death and was marked by a graveside commemorative celebration, featuring poetry readings and tributes to the poet. In October 2010, Sometimes the Sun Screams, a play based on the life and works of Jim Craven, was performed at An T√°in theatre in Dundalk. The play, penned by the poet's brother Paddy Craven as part of An T√°in Theatre Festival, was met with widespread acclaim and helped re-energise interest in Craven's work in his hometown.

He was born in Cummins, South Australia. Fos Williams, who played alongside Faehse at West Adelaide, and against him with Port Adelaide, paid him the ultimate compliment when he said \\"I've never met a better team mate or a more ferocious and determined opponent\\". Playing career Faehse made his league debut with the wartime West Adelaide-Glenelg combination on 27 May 1944, initially in the Ruck. A last minute inclusion in the side, Faehse kicked four goals in his first game. He would go on to play seven more games before a broken ankle put him out for the season, the longest layoff throughout his football career. After attending Prince Alfred College and with World War II coming to an end in 1945 West Adelaide and Glenelg both resumed as separate clubs, with Faehse remaining with The Bloods being a member of Wests Colts in 1943 and beginning an apprenticeship as an electrical engineer. He continually played in the ruck despite being just over six feet tall and weighing 12¬Ω stone. After being overheard by coach Harry Lee complaining about playing in the ruck he was moved to Centre half-back, becoming the best player of the position in South Australia which saw him represent South Australia on 19 occasions between 1948 and 1956. Faehse was a member of West Adelaide's 1947 premiership side which defeated Norwood 10.15 (75) to 5.15 (45) in front of just over 32,000 fans. It would be the only time in three Grand Final appearances that he would come away with the SANFL premiership. He was appointed as West Adelaide Captain- Coach in 1950 by the club committee, but that committee was ousted and the new leaders installed Jack Broadstock into the position instead, with the club paying Faehse the sum of A¬£60 for his trouble. At this time he considered asking the club for a clearance to play for neighboring West Torrens but decided to stay with West. Despite the off field dramas, Faehse had a supreme year in 1950 winning the first of two Best & Fairest awards with the club (the award, currently known as the \\"Neil Kerley Medal\\", was known at the time as the \\"Trabilsie Medal\\"). Faehse was appointed Captain-Coach of West again in 1951 and held the position for two seasons, compiling a 14-21 record. In 1951 he repeated as club Best & Fairest. After taking the club to sixth and missing the finals in both seasons he was replaced as coach of the side in 1953 by Laurie Cahill (uncle of future multiple Port Adelaide premiership player and coach and 1985-87 Wests coach John Cahill), but remained captain of the side until his retirement in 1956. Faehse was involved in an incident with Port Adelaide player Dave Boyd just before half-time of the 1954 SANFL Grand Final. He had flattened Boyd with what umpire Ken Aplin considered to be a fair bump. However, Port fans in the Sir Edwin Smith Stand at the Adelaide Oval didn't like what happened to their player and set upon the West Adelaide players as they made their way through the crowd to the dressing room with punches and kicks, with some players and officials reportedly not making it to the rooms until it was time to return to the ground for the second half. West, who had been leading at half time, were overrun by Port Adelaide in the second half of the match. The incident prompted the construction of new changerooms underneath the George Giffen Stand over the summer of 1954-55. With the entrance to the rooms now located in the south-western corner of the oval forming part of the boundary fence, players no longer had to go through the crowd to get to the rooms (until the building of the new rooms, football players used the same dressing rooms as the cricket players. The only way to get to the original rooms from the ground was through the members pavilion in the Sir Edwin Smith Stand). Faehse was given the honor of being the first player to use the tunnel when as captain he led West onto the field for a game against Norwood in 1955. Faehse retired from league football after the 1956 Grand Final loss to Port Adelaide having played 222 games, including 128 consecutive games earning him the nickname Iron Man, and kicking 60 goals for the club over 13 seasons. His total games was then a club record for West Adelaide. Representative Football Faehse represented South Australia with distinction 19 times between 1948 and 1956 and played in the 1950 (Brisbane), 1953 (Adelaide) and 1956 (Perth) Australian National Football Carnival's. Off Field Faehse was a players representative on the club's management committee from 1948 to 1955 and after retiring in 1956 was elected to the club's board by its members in 1958. He was also one of the prime movers to get West Adelaide their own home ground and was a member of the sub-committee which negotiated the lease of the land that is now the club's home ground (Richmond Oval) from the West Torrens Council. He organised the plan of the oval and arranged the original earthmoving, clearing and levelling of the site. The 1,500 seat grandstand at Richmond Oval, of which Faehse was one of the organisers and planners, was named the B.K. Faehse Stand in the 2000s honor of his services to the West Adelaide Football Club.Faehse was appointed to the position of SANFL Tribunal Commissioner in 1964 and held the position for 15 years and was an inaugural inductee into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2002. He was also an inaugural inductee into the West Adelaide Hall of Fame in 2005 and was elevated to Legend status in 2011 alongside the club's only other official legend, former team mate Neil Kerley.

The treatment for permanent teeth consists of replantation, immediately if possible. Deciduous teeth should not be replanted due to the risk of damaging the permanent tooth germ. Immediate replantation ensures the best possible prognosis but is not always possible since more serious injuries may be present. Studies have shown that teeth that are protected in a physiologically ideal media can be replanted within 15 minutes to one hour after the accident with good prognosis. The success of delayed replantation depends on the vitality of the cells remaining on the root surface. In normal conditions, a tooth is connected to the socket by means of the periodontal ligament. When a tooth is knocked out, that ligament stretches and splits in half. Maintaining the vitality of the cells that remain attached to the root surface is the key to success following replantation. Years ago, it was thought that the key to maintaining root cell vitality was keeping the knocked-out tooth wet, thus giving rise to storage media recommendations such as water, the mouth and milk. Recent research has shown that one of the key elements for maintaining vitality is storing the tooth in an environment that closely resembles the original socket environment. This environment is one that has the proper osmolality (cell pressure), pH, nutritional metabolites and glucose. There are scientifically designed storage media that provide this environment. These storage media are now available in retail products. Use of devices that incorporate the ideal storage media and protective apparatuses have increased the success rate of replanted knocked-out teeth to over 90% when used within sixty minutes of the accident. Prevention In contact sports, such as rugby, and even in non-contact sports, such as basketball, there is significant risk of dental injury. The best method for the prevention of knocked-out teeth is the use of helmets and mouth protectors (mouthguards). Custom-made mouth protectors, as opposed to ill-fitting, over-the-counter mouth protectors offer the best protection. Mouth protectors can be very inexpensive, however, the compliance rate for their use is poor. Studies have shown that, even when mandated, athletes and other high risk individuals often will not use them. Also, even with their use, mouth guards can be knocked-out, leaving the user unprotected.  Risk factors  * Postnormal occlusion * An over-jet exceeding 4 mm * Short upper lip * Incompetent lips * Mouth breathing Management Dental avulsion is a real dental emergency in which prompt management (within 20‚Äì40 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed permanent tooth should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage the surface of the root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the alveolar bone and later splinted by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt). Although some dentists advise that the best treatment for an avulsed tooth is immediate replantation, for a variety of reasons this can be difficult for the non-professional person. The teeth are often covered with debris. This debris must be washed off with a physiological solution and not scrubbed. Often multiple teeth are knocked-out and the person will not know which socket an individual tooth belongs to. The injured victim may have other more serious injuries that require more immediate attention or injuries such as a severely lacerated bleeding lip or gum that prevent easy visualization of the socket. Pain may be severe and the person may resist replantation of the teeth. People may, in light of infectious diseases (e.g. HIV), fear handling the teeth or touching the blood associated with them. If immediate replantation is not possible, the teeth should be placed in an appropriate storage solution and brought to a dentist who can then replant them. The dentist will clean the socket, wash the teeth if necessary, and replant them into their sockets. He will splint them to non-knocked-out teeth for a maximum of two weeks for teeth with normal alveolar process and bone support. Properly handled, even replantation of periodontally compromised permanent teeth in older patients under good maintenance have been reported, with splinting extending for over 4 weeks due to the reduced support structure for the root due to periodontal disease. One week to ten days after the replantation, the dental pulps of the replanted teeth should be removed and a root canal treatment completed within two months. In addition, as recommended in all dental traumas good oral hygiene with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of smoking for several days may provide a favorable condition for periodontal ligaments regeneration. = Initial assessment = When a patient arrives at the Dentist they should be seen quickly and with urgency. If the tooth has not been placed in a suitable storage medium, the Dentist should do this immediately. A thorough extra oral and intra-oral examination should be performed. The clinician should consider the age of the patient, the history of the injury and that it is in line with clinical findings. If there is concern about non-accidental injury, then safeguarding procedures should be followed. = Re-implantation = Prior to the beginning of the procedure, a local anesthetic should be administered to both the palatal/lingual tissues to minimize discomfort. Gentle Irrigation with a saline solution should be performed as this removes any clots within the socket, which could prevent the proper re-positioning of the tooth into its original position. The tooth should always be handled via the enamel on the crown, not the root! Wash the root surface with saline, be careful not to scrub the root surface, as this may crush the delicate cells. Any stubborn debris can be removed by 'gently dabbing with gauze soaked in saline'. The tooth may then be gently placed back into the socket. Soaking is the practice of soaking the tooth in an active medicament before re-implantation. It has been shown that soaking the avulsed tooth in an immune-modulating drug prior to re-implantation can increase periodontal healing and tooth survival, compared to a saline control. =Biologic basis for success of replantation following avulsion= Every tooth is connected to its surrounding bone by the periodontal ligament. The tooth receives its nourishment through this ligament. When a tooth is knocked-out, this ligament is stretched and splits in half; half stays on the tooth root and half stays on the socket wall. If these two halves can be kept alive, the tooth can be replanted and the halves of the ligament will reattach and the tooth will remain vital. The half that stays on the socket wall, since it remains connected to the bone blood supply, is naturally kept alive. However, the ligament cells that remain on the tooth root lose their blood and nutrition supply and must be artificially maintained. They must be protected from two potentially destructive processes: cell crushing and loss of normal cell metabolism. All treatment between the time of the accident and the ultimate replantation must be focused on preventing these two possibilities. =Prevention of cell crushing= When teeth are knocked-out, they end up on an artificial surface: the floor, the ground or material such as carpeting. If the surface is hard, the tooth root cells will be traumatized. Since the cells remaining on the tooth root are very delicate, additional trauma to the tooth root cells must be avoided so as to avoid more tooth root cell crushing. This damage can occur while picking the tooth up and/or during transportation to the dentist. When a tooth is picked up, it should always be grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger pressure on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even with the use of a physiologic saline, the ‚Äúscrubbing‚Äù of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment. =Maintenance of normal cell metabolism= Normally metabolizing tooth root cells have an internal cell pressure (osmolality) of 280-300 mOs and a pH of 7.2. When there is an uninterrupted blood supply, all of the metabolites (calcium, phosphate, potassium) and glucose that the cells require are provided. When the tooth is knocked-out, this normal blood supply is cut off and within 15 minutes most of the stored metabolites have been depleted and the cells will begin to die. Within one to two hours, enough cells will die that rejection of the tooth by the body at a later time is the usual outcome. The method by which the body rejects the replanted tooth is a process called ‚Äúreplacement root resorption‚Äù. During this process, the tooth root cells become necrotic (dead) and will activate the immunologic mechanism of the body to attempt to remove this necrotic layer and literally eats away the tooth root. This is called ‚Äúroot resorption‚Äù It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by x-rays for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed ankylosis) attaches the tooth firmly to the jaw bone and stops normal tooth eruption and impedes normal jaw growth. Research has shown that the critical factor for reduction of the death of the tooth root cells and the subsequent root replacement resorption following reimplantation of knocked-out teeth is maintenance of normal cell physiology and metabolism of the cells left on the tooth root while the tooth is out of the socket. In order to maintain this normalcy, the environment in which the teeth are stored must supply the optimum internal cell pressure, cell nutrients and pH. =Storage media= There are many storage media available for knocked-out tooth storage. The most often recommended are: saliva, physiologic saline, milk and pH balanced cell preserving fluids. Water and ice have been shown to damage the tooth root cells, and as such, avulsed teeth should never be stored in them. The osmolality and pH of water and ice is very low (7-17mOs) compared to normal cell pressure (280 mOs). When a knocked-out tooth is placed in water, the cells attempt to equalize with the surrounding environment, the cell fluid tries to move to the outside pressure environment and burst. Water with table salt in it is damaging to the knocked out teeth. Saliva, that is placing the tooth under the accident victim‚Äôs tongue or in the cheek, has been recommended. Saliva, as a storage media, causes twice damage as water. Its osmolality is very low, causing bursting of the tooth root cells, but additionally, because saliva is filled with its normal flora of microorganisms, it will severely infect the tooth root cells. When the tooth is replanted, not only will the cells be necrotic but they will also infect the bone socket. Physiologic saline has a fairly compatible osmolality and will not cause cell swelling but it lacks the metabolites and glucose necessary for maintenance of normal cell metabolism. Milk has been also recommended as a storage medium for avulsed teeth. Its advantage is the high availability of fresh whole milk. Only whole milk can be used for tooth preservation. Skim milk and heavy cream do not have the correct fluid pressure and will cause damage to the root cells. Milk has no observed regenerative properties for cells on knocked out teeth. It was discovered 30 years ago that milk was less damaging to knocked out teeth than water or saliva. It was recommended because it has a compatible osmolality (fluid pressure) to tooth root cells and it is thought to be readily available. However, like physiologic saline, milk lacks the necessary metabolites and glucose necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism of the tooth root cells. The cells on knocked-out tooth roots in milk do not die immediately but are unable to replicate (mitosis) and so are less able to reform new cells when replanted. The most optimum storage media that are available have been shown to be pH balanced cell preserving solutions. The best known and most extensively tested is called Hank‚Äôs Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). It has all of the metabolites such as Ca, phosphate ions, K+ and glucose that are necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism for long periods of time. HBSS has been extensively tested in dental and medical research for the past twenty years. This research has shown that 90% of cells stored in HBSS for 24 hours maintain their normal viability and after four days, still have 70%viable. In research studies, extracted dog‚Äôs teeth that have been placed in HBSS for four days can still be replanted with little signs of resorption. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution is found in a Save-A-Tooth, a storage device for the storage, preservation, and regeneration of tooth root cells. HBSS also has been shown to be capable of replacing lost cell metabolites. Since a cell that has been cut off from its blood supply depletes its stored metabolites after fifteen minutes, a tooth that has been extra-oral for one hour has less vital cells to reconnect with the bone ligament cells. Some studies in dental research have shown that knocked out teeth that have been dry for up to one hour will have less resorption if they are soaked in a HBSS for 30 minutes prior to replantation. In these studies, dog‚Äôs teeth were extracted and left dry for 30, 45 and 60 minutes and then soaked in HBSS for 30 minutes and then reimplanted. These teeth showed 50% less replacement resorption following reimplantation. It has also been shown that keeping the teeth cold while in the HBSS does not affect success. Many other types of storage liquids have been tested such as powdered milk, Enfamil, Gatorade, and contact lens solution. All of them have been shown to either be ineffective or damaging to avulsed tooth. Prognosis Despite the treatment provided, dental avulsion carries one of the poorest outcomes with 73-96% of the replanted teeth eventually being lost.Andersson, L., Andreasen, F. M. & Andreasen, J. O., 2007. Textbook and Colour Atlas of Traumatic Injuries to the Teeth. 4th ed. Copenhagen: Wiley-Blackwell. There are three main factors which significantly influence the prognosis of the tooth. These include: * The extent of damage to the periodontal ligament (PDL) at the time of injury * The storage conditions of the avulsed tooth * The duration prior to replantation Dental trauma varies widely in complexity and usually there is little that lay people or professionals (excluding dentists) can do. However, avulsion is the one type of traumatic dental injury where lay people can play a critical role in determining the prognosis of the tooth. The tooth has the best prognosis if it is replanted within 15 minutes of the accident but also has an excellent prognosis if it has been stored in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident. PDL healing is the primary outcome measure when assessing interventions for tooth avulsion. When the healing of the PDL is unfavourable it means that there is no longer protection for the root from the surrounding alveolar bone. The bone that surrounds the tooth is continually undergoing physiological remodelling. Over time, the root is gradually replaced by bone, which leads to the loss of tooth root and so the crown of the tooth fractures. The results of replanting permanent incisor teeth can be divided into short, medium and long term survival of the tooth. If the tooth is replanted it acts in the short term to maintain space, maintain bone and provide good to excellent aesthetics. If unfavourable healing has occurred, the tooth can last into the medium term on 2-10+ years depending on the speed of bone turnover. Long-term survival of the tooth only happens when favourable healing of the periodontal ligament has occurred. If this happens the tooth can be estimated to survive as long as any other tooth Epidemiology Research has shown that more than five million teeth are knocked-out each year in the United States. Dental avulsion is a type of dental trauma and the prevalence of dental trauma is estimated at 17.5% and can vary due to the geographical area. Although dental trauma is relatively low, dental avulsion is the fourth most prevalent type of dental trauma. Dental avulsion is more prevalent in males than females. Males are three times more likely to suffer from dental avulsion than females. Up to 25% of school-aged children and military trainees and fighters experience some kind of dental trauma each year. The incidence of dental avulsion in school aged children ranges from 0.5 to 16% of all dental trauma. Many of these teeth are knocked-out during school activities or sporting events such as contact sports, football, basketball, and hockey. It is important for anyone whom is related, working, or witnessing sports that they be educated on this subject matter. Being educated could aid in minimizing injuries that could do further harm to the victim. Being informed and spreading awareness of dental avulsion in the state of knowledge, treatment, and prevention could make an impact. History The first reported cases of knocked-out teeth being replanted was by Pare in 1593. In 1706, Pierre Fauchard also reported replanting knocked out teeth. Wigoper in 1933 used a cast gold splint to hold reimplanted teeth in place. In 1959, Lenstrup and Skieller declared that the success rate of replanted knocked out teeth should be considered a temporary procedure because the success rate of less than 10% was so poor. In 1966 in a retrospective study, Andresen theorized that 90% of avulsed teeth could be successfully retained if they were replanted within the first 30 minutes of the accident. In 1974, Cvek showed that removal of the dental pulp following reimplantation was necessary to prevent resorption of the tooth root. In 1974, Cvek showed that storage of knocked out teeth in saline could improve the success of replanted teeth. In 1977, Lindskog et al. showed that the key to retention of the knocked-out teeth was to maintain the vitality of the periodontal ligament. In 1980, Blomlof showed the storing the periodontal ligament cells in a biocompatible medium could extend the extra oral time to four hours or more. He found that the best storage medium was a medical research fluid called Hank‚Äôs Balanced Solution. In this study, it was serendipitously discovered that milk could also maintain cell viability for two hours. In 1981, Andreasen showed that crushing of cells on the tooth root could cause death of the cells and lead to resorption and reduction in prognosis. In 1983, Matsson et al. showed that soaking in Hank‚Äôs Balanced Solution for thirty minutes prior to reimplantation could revitalize extracted dog‚Äôs teeth that were dry for 60 minutes. In 1989, a systematic storage device was developed to optimally store and preserve knocked out teeth. In 1992, Trope et al. showed that extracted dog‚Äôs teeth could be stored in Hank‚Äôs Balanced Solution for up to 96 hours and still maintain significant vitality. In this study, milk was only able to maintain vitality for two hours. Archaeology In ancient times, ritual dental avulsion was widespread among different cultures around the world. For example, it was common during the Early Holocene (from around 11,500 BP up to 5,000 BP) in North Africa, and was occasionally observed in the Natufian culture (14,000 to 11,500 BP).Arkadiusz So≈Çtysiak, Hojjat Darabi, Human remains from Ali Kosh, Iran, 2017. Bioarchaeology of the Near East, 11:76‚Äì83 (2017) Short fieldwork report. Such tooth avulsion was the intentional removal of one or more teeth, which was done for ritual or aesthetic reasons. It was also used to denote group affiliation. Typically the maxillary incisors were the teeth most often selected for removal. This practice is still common in parts of Africa.

In the United States, Micro's products are sold under the brand \\"Micro Kickboard\\" for trademark reasons. The company holds several patents for its products. Monday, 22 April 2019  History  = Idea = Wim Ouboter, born in 1960, invented the kickscooter out of laziness. He states that the way from his apartement to his favorite restaurant was too far to go by foot and yet too close to use a bike. He then invented a two-wheeled scooter for those kind of distances that could easily be folded and placed in a backpack. He pitched his idea to Smart and they were willing to put one Scooter in every single car. Ouboter then tried to find a manufacturer for his innovation, but soon realized that Europe simply was too expensive. In Taiwan he could convince the owner of a factory to produce the Scooter, also because he had proof that Smart liked his idea. Just before the production could start Smart failed the moose test and so the project was put on hold, since Smart had to solve that problem. = Formation of Micro Mobility Systems = But Ouboter had another idea: a three-wheeled scooter, called the Kickboard. He teamed up with K2 and presented his idea at the International Sports Fair (ISPO) in Munich in 1998 very successfully. With the earned money he founded Micro Mobility Systems in 1999 and started producing the two-wheeled Scooter, which was an even bigger success. Because of the excessive demand, he allowed his partner in Taiwan to distribute the Scooter in the United States with the name Razor for a commission. After having sold about one million Scooters in 2000, the sales decreased rapidly in 2001. = Becoming a lifestyle brand = In the subsequent years, the company continued to invent new products, designed for urban mobility, like the Mini Micro for kids, the Scooter Luggage or the electric emicro one. In addition, Micro has teamed up with other brands, like Peugeot, Suitsupply or Vibram to name a few. With Micro Xtreme the brand also went into Freestyle Sports and works closely with professional Athletes like Benjamin Friant. After the huge success in 2000 and the rapid downfall in 2001, Micro has grown organically with a gross revenue in 2014 of 60 Million Swiss Francs. With the development of the company, manufacturing capacities shifted to RazorUSA in California. The evolution of Micro into a lifestyle brand that invents mobility solutions for children, teenagers and adults was honoured by Ernest and Young in 2015, when Wim Ouboter was nominated as Entrepreneur of the Year. In July 2019, BMW unveiled 2 new scooters made in collaboration with Micro Mobility Systems. = Microlino = Microlino at Geneva Motor Show 2016 The Microlino was first presented in 2016 at the Geneva Car Show. Based on the design of the Isetta, a 1950s bubble car which was sold over 160,000 times, the new design has a battery powered electric motor. The two-seat small car is designed for urban mobility with a top speed of , a range of and can be charged from a domestic power outlet. The car is expected to be on the market in 2019 with an estimated price of 12,000 Euro and initial sales limited to Germany and Switzerland. In July 2018, the firm announced that Microlino has just passed the final tests for EU homologation.  References   External links  * Micro Mobility Systems * Bruch, H. et al. 2003.

In 1882, fueled by national rivalry and a language barrier, the tension between Pasteur and the younger Koch erupted into an acute conflict. Pasteur had already discovered molecular chirality, investigated fermentation, refuted spontaneous generation, inspired Lister's introduction of antisepsis to surgery, introduced pasteurization to France's wine industry, answered the silkworm diseases blighting France's silkworm industry, attenuated a Pasteurella species of bacteria to develop vaccine to chicken cholera (1879), and introduced anthrax vaccine (1881). Koch had transformed bacteriology by introducing the technique of pure culture, whereby he established the microbial cause of the disease anthrax (1876), had introduced both staining and solid culture plates to bacteriology (1881), had identified the microbial cause of tuberculosis (1882), had incidentally popularized Koch's postulates for identifying the microbial cause of a disease, and would later identify the microbial cause of cholera (1883). Although Koch had briefly and, thereafter, his bacteriological followers regarded a bacterial species' properties as unalterable,Felix L√∂hnis, \\"Studies upon the life cycles of the bacteria\\", Part I: \\"Review of the literature, 1838‚Äì1918\\", Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 1921;61(2):5‚Äì335, pp 8, 10‚Äì12. Pasteur's modification of virulence to develop vaccine demonstrated this doctrine's falsity. At an 1882 conference, a mistranslated term from French to German during Pasteur's lecture triggered Koch's indignation, whereupon Koch's two bacteriologist colleagues, Friedrich Loeffler and Georg Gaffky, published denigration of the entirety of Pasteur's research on anthrax since 1877.  Tensions between France and Germany  Collage depicting the Franco-Prussian war. Germany had unified by way of its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71), seizing Alsace-Lorraine from France. Pasteur was professor in the University of Strasbourg, located in Alsace, where he married the daughter of the rector. Jean Baptiste Pasteur, the only son of Louis and Marie Pasteur, was a soldier in the Franco-Prussian War. The tone set by this war contributed to the rivalry between Koch and Pasteur. The \\"German Problem\\", as Germany increasingly gained scientific, technological, and industrial dominance, fed tensions among European nations.Lowe John, The Great Powers, Imperialism and the German Problem 1865‚Äì1925 (London: Routledge, 1994), pp. 195‚Äì9. Germ theory's applications were embedded in the heightening quest by France, Germany, Britain, and Italy to colonize Africa and Asia with the aid of tropical medicine, a new variant of colonial medicine, while medical scientists in respective nations vied to lead advances.  Koch's bacteriology and anthrax  thumb left Robert Koch was a German physician.He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his tuberculosis findings in 1905. He is considered one of the founders of microbiology. In 1863, influenced by Pasteur's research on fermentation, fellow Frenchman Casimir Davaine mostly explained the cause of anthrax, but Davaine's explanation was opposed by those who opposed the idea that infection with a microorganism could explain it. In 1840, Jakob Henle had proposed microorganism infections caused diseases, and in 1875 German botanist Ferdinand Cohn weighed in on a controversy in microbiology by declaring that the elementary unit was the cell and that each form of bacteria was constant and naturally divided from the other forms. Influenced by Henle and by Cohn, Koch developed a pure culture of the bacteria described by Davaine, traced its spore stage, inoculated it into animals, and showed it caused anthrax. Pasteur called this a \\"remarkable achievement\\". See In pure culture, bacteria tend to keep constant traits, and Koch reported having already observed constancy. Pasteur undertook investigation, yet gave much credit to Davaine. Meanwhile, Pasteur's researchers always reported variation in their cultures. In 1879, Henri Toussaint identified a bacterial species involved in chicken cholera and named the genus in honor of Pasteur, Pasteurella. In Pasteur's laboratory, a culture of Pasteurella multocida was left out over a weekend exposed to air, and Pasteur and Emile Roux noticed upon return to the laboratory that its virulence to chickens was diminished. Pasteur applied the discovery to develop chicken cholera vaccine, introduced in a public experiment, an empirical challenge to the stance of Koch's bacteriologists that bacterial traits were unalterable.  Pasteur's attenuation and vaccines  thumb leftLouis Pasteur [1822 - 1895], microbiologist and chemist Description. From 1878 to 1880, when publishing on anthrax, Pasteur referred to the bacteria by the name given it by Frenchman Davaine, but in one footnote called it \\"Bacillus anthracis of the Germans\\". In July 1880 Toussaint reported developing a technique of chemical deactivation to produce anthrax vaccine that successfully protected dogs and cattle, and was praised by the Academy of Science, but Pasteur attacked the feat‚Äîchemical deactivation and not virulence attenuation to make a vaccine‚Äîas impossible. Pasteur soon introduced his own anthrax vaccine in a highly successful public experiment, and entered commerce with it. Pasteur was criticized by Koch and colleagues.Koch R & Carter KC, Essays of Robert Koch (New York: Greenwood Press, 1987). (Pasteur had not used attenuation, but secretly used Toussaint's technique.)Geison GL, The Private Science of Louis Pasteur (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995).  Microbe hunting, cholera, and public health  Cholera bacteria under a microscope. In 1883, responding to a cholera epidemic in Alexandria, Egypt, both Pasteur and Koch sent missions vying to identify its cause. Koch returned victorious, whereupon Pasteur switched research direction and began development of rabies vaccine. As to public health, Koch's bacteriologists feuded with Max von Pettenkofer‚Äîwhose miasmatic theory claimed the bacteria was but one causal factor among at least several‚Äîbut von Pettenkoffer stubbornly opposed water treatment, and the massive cholera epidemic in Hamburg, Germany, in 1892 devastated von Pettenkofer's position, and German public health was grounded on Koch's bacteriology. Meanwhile, Pasteur led introduction of pasteurization in France.  Rabies vaccine and Pasteur Institute  Rabies, uncommon but excruciating and almost invariably fatal, was dreaded. Amid anthrax vaccine's success, Pasteur introduced rabies vaccine (1885), the first human vaccine since Jenner's smallpox vaccine (1796). On 6 July 1885, the vaccine was tested on 9-year old Joseph Meister who had been bitten by a rabid dog but failed to develop rabies, and Pasteur was called a hero.Trueman C, \\"Louis Pasteur\\", History Learning Site, 2000‚Äì2011, Web. (Even without vaccination, not everyone bitten by a rabid dog develops rabies.) After other apparently successful cases, donations poured in from across the globe, funding the establishment of the Pasteur Institute, the globe's first biomedical institute, which opened in Paris in 1888. Pasteur Institute trained military physicians in colonial medicine, although French government soon took over this role. The success of Pasteur's modification of bacterial virulence inspired confidence in the universality of Pasteurian science, though Pasteur's researchers preferred the term microbiology over the term bacteriology. Koch discouraged use of rabies vaccine, whose production later became a premise for opening Pasteur Institutes abroad, as in Shanghai, China. The first overseas Pasteur Institute was opened by Albert Calmette in Saigon in French Indochina in 1891, although Pasteur's nephew Adrien Loir was already planning to open one in Australia.  Tuberculin and Robert Koch Institute  In 1882, Koch reported identification of the tubercle bacillus as the cause of tuberculosis,Koch R (1882), \\"Die atiologie der tuberkulose\\", in Schwalbe J, ed, Gesammelte Werke von Robert Koch (Leipzig: Georg Thieme, 1912, orig 1910), pp 428‚Äì45. cementing germ theory. Koch took his research into a new direction‚Äîapplied research‚Äîto develop a tuberculosis treatment and use the profits to found his own research institute, autonomous from government. In 1890 Koch introduced the intended drug, tuberculin, but it soon proved ineffective, and accounts of deaths followed in new press. Amid Koch's reluctance to disclose tuberculin's formula, Koch's reputation sustained damage, but Koch retained lasting acclaim and received the 1905 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis\\". Koch accepted government's offer to direct the Institute for Infectious Diseases (1891), in Berlin, a prestigious position but not the kind of institute that Koch had sought. It was later renamed the Robert Koch Institute, which remains a government organization.  American medicine embraces Koch  The monomorphist doctrine of Koch's bacteriologists suggested public health interventions to eliminate bacteria, whereas Pasteur's acceptance of variation suggested attenuating bacterial virulence in the laboratory to develop vaccines. Although inspired by Pasteur's applications suggesting medicine's potential, American physicians traveled to Germany to learn Koch's bacteriology as basic science, though Pasteur emphasized the fuzzy boundary between basic science and applied science. From 1876 to 1878, the American William Henry Welch trained in Germany pathology, and in 1879 opened America's first scientific laboratory, a pathology laboratory in Bellevue's medical school in New York. While in Germany, Welch had met John Shaw Billings who had been appointed by Daniel Coit Gilman‚Äîthe first president of the newly forming Johns Hopkins University‚Äîto plan Hopkins' hospital and medical school. Named the medical school's first dean in 1883, Welch promptly traveled for training in Koch's bacteriology, and returned to America eager to transform medicine with the \\"secrets of nature\\". Hopkins medical school opened in 1894 with Welch emphasizing Koch's bacteriology, which became the foundation of modern medicine. As \\"dean of American medicine\\", William H Welch became the first scientific director of Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901), and appointed his former Hopkins student Simon Flexner the first director of pathology and bacteriology laboratories. Aided by the \\"Flexner report\\", published in 1910 while Welch was president of the American Medical Association, Welch's view of science and medicine became the national standard, a transformation of American medical education completed around 1930. As first dean of America's first public health school, founded in 1916 at Hopkins, Welch set the standard for public health, and with Simon Flexner exported the Hopkins model internationally.  Pasteur's image ascends  Although Pasteur died in 1895, eventually over thirty official Pasteur Institutes opened across the globe. Pasteur's team had planned in 1885 to open a rabies-treatment facility in St. Louis, Missouri, and an American Pasteur Institute in New York City, but the plans were abandoned, and America has never hosted an official Pasteur Institute.Pasteur Foundation, \\"Pasteur Institutes USA: A turn-of-the-century phenomenon\\" , Remembrance of Things Pasteur, Accessed 5 Sep 2012 on Web. A number of American copycats appeared, however, starting with \\"Chicago Pasteur Institute\\" in 1890, and \\"New York Pasteur Institute\\" in 1891. In 1897 a \\"Pasteur Institute\\" opened in Baltimore, in 1900 in Pittsburgh and St. Louis, in 1903 in Ann Arbor and Austin, and in 1904 perhaps in Philadelphia. In 1908, Georgia Department of Public Health opened a \\"Pasteur Department\\" in Atlanta, California State Hygienic Laboratory opened a \\"Pasteur Division\\" in Berkeley, and a \\"Pasteur Institute\\" opened in Washington, D.C. In 1900, Paul Gibier, the French medical scientist who opened \\"New York Pasteur Institute\\", accidentally died, but his nephew, George Gibier Rambaud, continued it on reduced scale until he closed it when US Medical Corps commissioned him overseas in 1918. While MDs ascended in American public health, it was thought that \\"the greatest contribution of all, the foundation upon which modern sanitary science is built, was made by Pasteur.\\"  Nationalism flares  Koch was celebrated by the American medical community, including by Welch, when at last Koch visited America in 1908. Soon, however, America was influenced by the British and French view that although their denizens appreciated Germany's progress in science and arts, Germany was elitist and dismissive while socially and politically antiquated, so authoritarian and aggressive as to resemble medieval tyranny.Charles Sarolea, The Anglo-German Problem, American edn (New York & London: G P Putnam's Sons, 1915), pp 33‚Äì6. In 1917, when America entered World War I (1914‚Äì18), US government seized German-owned property and assets, including Bayer AG's American trademarks and the 80% of Merck & Co's shares owned by George Merck.Kirk K W Tyson, Competition in the 21st Century (Boca Raton: CRC Press LLC, 1997), p. 237.Ibis S√°nchez-Serrano, The World's Health Care Crisis: From the Laboratory Bench to the Patient's Bedside (London: Elsevier, 2011), pp 55‚Äì7. Welch exhibited gratuitous anti-German bias despite the debt of his own career, thus American medicine, to Germany, especially to Koch's bacteriology. After World War II (1939‚Äì45), and more of the \\"German Problem\\", Merck & Co became the global leader in vaccinology.  Two legacies  Tuberculin's main use rapidly became in determining M tuberculosis infection‚Äîa use remaining till today‚Äîbut this use soon revealed that in London, 9 of 10 individuals were infected, whereas only 1 in 10 of the infected developed the disease. In 1901 at the London Congress on Tuberculosis, Koch stated on theoretical grounds that M bovis, which infects cows, was not transmissible to humans. British attendees disagreed, and later Theobald Smith and the English Royal Commission empirically established that M bovis was transmissible and could result in human disease. Though widely considered ineffective as treatment, tuberculin might have remained in use for this purpose until the 1940s and maybe had some effectiveness. Milk pasteurization became popular in America around 1920. In 1921 Albert Calmette and Camille Gu√©rin of Pasteur Institute introduced tuberculosis vaccine, whose virulence of strains varied in the late 1920s. BCG vaccine was not used in the public health of America, which virtually eliminated tuberculosis without it. BCG vaccine's effectiveness preventing tuberculosis remains uncertain, but appears to confer nonspecific survival gains, as perhaps by preventing leprosy, and is a cancer treatment. Pasteur had highlighted a new threat‚Äîmicroorganisms benign to humans passing among and multiplying in nonhuman animals while gaining new virulence for humans‚Äîthat is thought to loom and to have approximately materialized with AIDS. Although Koch's postulates are often inapplicable, they remain heuristic, and the authority of \\"fulfilling Koch's postulates\\" is still invoked in medical science, though often in modified form, as in the identification of HIV-1 as the cause of AIDS or the identification of SARS coronavirus as the cause of SARS. Germ theory's stance that the \\"germ\\" was the disease's necessary and sufficient cause‚Äîthe single factor both required and complete to result in the disease‚Äîproved false. Germ theory gradually evolved to include other factors, whereupon germ theory resembled miasmatic theory, which had had to recognize bacteria as a causal factor, and so the two competing explanations merged without true, decisive victor. Twentieth-century philosophy, inspired by revolutions in physics, establishment of molecular biology, and advances in epidemiology, revealed that any claim of a single causal factor both necessary (required) and sufficient (complete), the cause, is untenable. French-born microbiologist Ren√© Dubos, a biographer of Pasteur, discussed tuberculosis to illustrate disease's social causes and to illustrate the failure of germ theory,Conrad P, Mirage of genes‚Äîsec \\"Introduction\\", p. 438, in Conrad P, ed, The Sociology of Health and Illness: Critical Perspectives, 8th edn (New York: Worth Publishers, 2009).Ren√© J Dubos, Mirage of Health: Utopia, Progress, and Biological Change (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1959 / New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1987). whose apparent successes were aided by improvements in nutrition and living conditions but sparked scientific research that brought a wealth of new understandings.Meeting summary, \\"Antimicrobial Resistance: Implications for Global Health & Novel Intervention Strategies\\" , Institute of Medicine of National Academies, Apr 2010.

Shraideh‚Äôs motivations included personal hatred towards Ali Khulki Al-Sharayri, one of Emir Abdullah's ministers, who was head of the Irbid district. Shraideh demanded that the Kura be designated a separate entity, severed from Irbid, and answerable separately to Amman. The Amman central government refused such arrangement as it would have paved the way for more similar demands from other ambitious tribal leaders. The central government sent tax collectors to Kura but one of them was killed. The collectors withdrew to Irbid and returned with an armed force that was ambushed, killing no less than fifteen and imprisoning several others. Abdullah, realizing the nascent central government's weakness, went to Kura personally. Shraideh was flattered, and declared his submission upon the Emir's arrival. In return, Abdullah announced an amnesty for the rebels, and the Emir reshuffled the cabinet to remove Sharayri, which added to Shraideh's satisfaction. Background In 1920, sheikh Kulaib al-Shurayda had established himself as an autonomous rural potentate with French support and encouragement from Damascus. When the first central government was organized in Amman in April 1921, and the Kura was declared a part of the administrative region of Irbid, Kulayb refused to accept such arrangement. One reason for this was the personal feud between sheikh Kulayb and Ali Khulqi al-Sharayiri, the head of the government of Ajlun in Irbid, who has meanwhile become a minister in Amman, in charge of security. Kulayb got a strong support from local villagers, asking Kura to be separated from Irbid and established as an administrative district of its own, directly under Amman's governorship. 1921 revolt and amnesty The recently organized central government of Transjordan could not accept Kulayb's demands, which could have resulted in similar demands from other sheikhs, and badly needed money, meaning immediate need of tax collection. As a result, tax collectors were sent to Kura, escorted by a contingent of local gendarmerie. Though they had eventually arrived to Kura, the deputy commanding officer of the force was killed by local villagers, and the tax collectors retreated to Irbid. Fuad Slim, commander of the cavalry, was ordered to advance against the rebels and find the responsible for the killing. However, alerted people of Kura caught the attacking force in an ambush and defeated them. Fifteen of the attacking force were killed and many, including Fuad Slim himself, taken prisoners. Unable to reduce Kulayb by force, the government of Transjordan offered negotiations. The government was refused to reach a surrender of Kura rebels, responsible for killing, and it was finally decided to close the feud by tribal custom of returning government forces' horses and arms and pay a diyyah (blood money, or reparations) to the relatives of the killed government men. Even this arrangement didn't work, and emir Abdullah decided to resort to personal diplomacy and arrive to Kura himself. Flattered by the \\"respect\\" of emir's personal visit, the leader of Kura rebellion, sheikh Kulayb, hastened to meet him upon arrival and declared his surrender and submission. In return, the sheikh and his men were granted a general amnesty. About the same time Ali Khulqi al-Sharayiri was removed from cabinet after a government reshuffle - a matter which added to sheikh Kulayb's satisfaction. The scandalous failure of the central government to suppress the Kura rebellion encouraged similar rebellions in other areas, which made the tax collection impossible in many parts of the country. 1923 revolt In 1923, sheikh Kulayb al-Shurayda of Kura district renewed his rebel activities, and prompted a strong response by the British. His stronghold in Tibna was bombed by the RAF and captain Frederick Peake led a newly organized reserve force of 750 men in an all-out attack on the district. Unable to further resist, the sheikh fled to seek refuge in Balqa, while a number of his men were caught and brought to trial. Aftermath On May 25, 1923 Britain formally announced the self-government of Transjordan under emir Abdullah, and the emir issued a general pardon for the Kura rebels in honor of this occasion. With the end of the Kura affair, another trouble began to loom as the feud between Banu Sakhr bedouins, headed by Mithqal al-Fayez ‚Äì especially favored by emir Abdullah, and Adwan bedouins of Balqa, headed by Sultan al-Adwan. Dangerously exposed to the Wahhabi raids from Arabia, emir Abdullah had not intention to alienate Sultan al-Adwan, even if he did pay a special attention to Banu Sakhr. After unsuccessful pacification attempts Sultan al-Adwan decided to strike first. He advanced on Amman in a full force, and occupied two gendarmerie outposts, at the western entrances to the capital. Adwan's forces were defeated in a fierce battle and put to flight. Some tribal unrest continued to simmer in the country for a few years after the suppression of Adwan insurrection. In 1926, the government had to send a force to suppress a rebellion in Wadi Musa, where the villagers refused to pay taxes and seized and looted the local gendarmerie post and government house.

The Band have gone on to support The Cult on their UK tour and have been signed to Universal subsidiary, Fiction Records. The band consist of Jamie Lovatt (Guitar and Vox) Jon Hartz Wild (Guitar) Harry King (Bass) and Cillian Sheil (Drums.) The band were signed to Fiction Records and went on to record their first album with Jason Perry. Original members Samantha Valentine and Alex Glover left the band after pressures, with drummer David Woods exiting after being struck with a back condition, meaning he could no longer play. On 22 February 2014, lead singer Jamie Lovatt appeared as an auditionee on The Voice UK, singing a cover of Everybody's Free (To Feel Good). After performing he stated that the band had been dropped by their record label but had been continuing to perform and write music. He joined Ricky's team for the next round and departed in the knock out stages to Chris Royal. The band are set to release a single prior to extensive touring later on in the year.

Set in the universe of DC Comics' Batman, it consists of two teams of six players which try to kill the other team: one with amateur vigilantes dressed like Batman, and the other with criminals dressed like his archenemy, the Joker. It features customizable characters and a range of both traditional and imagined weapons. Unlike other Batman games, Gotham City Impostors was not physically released. It was released on Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows via Games for Windows ‚Äì Live in February 2012. The game was re-released on Microsoft Windows as a free-to-play title in August 30, 2012 via Steam using Steamworks. Gameplay In Gotham City Impostors there is a heavy emphasis on allowing players to customize their character. Weapons, clothing, and even the size of the character can be modified. Gotham City Impostors is playable by at most twelve players simultaneously. Players can customize their costume, gadgets and other aspects of the game. It features a colorful and over-the-top visual style, including such settings as an amusement park. In addition to guns and knives, the players are able to use other gadgets such as grappling hooks, glider wings, roller skates and explosives. The game includes both conventional guns and outlandish weapons, including a grenade fashioned like a jack-in-the-box and a rocket launcher made of PVC piping. The game has four different modes: Psych Warfare, Fumigation, Bounty Hunter, and Team Deathmatch. Psych Warfare involves the two teams trying to bring a battery back to their base and defend it long enough for it to allow a machine to brainwash the other team. Fumigation sends players to capture and hold three gasblasters, a type of command post, to get their gas level to 100%. Players are treated to the sight of the enemy being swarmed by bats (if the Bats win), or suffocated by a poison cloud (if the Jokerz win). In Bounty Hunter you win the match by collecting coins enemy players drop when they die, you can also pick up your teammates' dropped coins to deny the other team points. In Team Deathmatch the goal is to kill enemy players as fast as possible. There are also Challenges; these are played alone, and are used to master gadgets and earn extra experience. Lastly, there is a training mode called Initiation, where the Bats' leader instructs the player on how to use weapons and gadgets. Development and marketing Promotion at E3 2011 Batman: Impostors, a storyline that ran through Detective Comics #867-870, was inspired by Gotham City Impostors. The premise for the storyline is that the impostor Jokers were created by Winslow Heath, a man who was a victim of Joker venom early in Batman's career; as a result of narcotics that he had ingested before he was exposed to the venom, Heath survived the attack, but was left paralyzed while fully conscious for years, his features twisted into a permanent duplicate of the Joker's own visage. When he regained full mobility, he discovered that his girlfriend, Beth ‚Äì who was exposed to the Joker venom under the same circumstances, as the two took the same drugs - was left to die in their apartment as Batman was so caught up in trying to catch the Joker that he never looked back after 'rescuing' Heath, with the result that Beth was left to get eaten alive by crows. Driven insane by the torment that he endured in the hospital, Heath called himself the Impostor Joker and created a unique 'Joker juice' named Formula 5 that would turn those who used it into temporary duplicates of the Joker with a significant high in the process, simultaneously posing as the Impostor Batman to rally others to also become impostor Batmen, go up against the impostor Jokers and trigger a gang war. Although Batman deduced the truth and captured Heath, he was left troubled at the implication that Heath was correct in his statement that Batman creates his own villains. The preview for Cartoon Network's upcoming animation block DC Nation Shorts in 2012 included animation of Gotham City Impostors. Downloadable content was released for all platforms and includes new weapons, costumes, and three new stages, The 25th Floor, Arkham Asylum, and East End. The game went free-to- play in 2012, but since then no new updates have been released. In the game's menu it was announced that, due to GameSpy shutting down on May 31, 2014, the servers for the PS3 version will shut down. As of July 25, 2014, all PS3 servers for Gotham City Impostors have been shut down and the game is now unplayable. It was released for free as part of the Xbox Live Games with Gold program on July 1, 2014. Gotham City Impostors remains obtainable and playable on PC via Steam. Reception The Escapist writer Allistair Pinsof called the demo a \\"carbon copy\\" of Call of Duty first-person shooter games, but said it added enough new features to be enjoyable. G4 writer Leah Jackson said of the playable demo: \\"Quite frankly, the game doesn't feel like your run of the mill downloadable title. It controls great, looks fantastic, and with all of the options, I can say that I was quite impressed.\\" The game scored a 65/100 on Metacritic.

The company serves a wide variety of industries, including alternative fuels, biopharmaceuticals, chemical processing, commercial food equipment, laboratory and analytical, marine, medical equipment, nuclear energy and power generation, petrochemical, oil and gas, solar energy, transportation and wastewater treatment. It provides industrial heaters, temperature control products, heat tracing products and packaged heating systems that include heat transfer and vaporizer systems, large tank heating systems, boilers and steam generators, air handlers and load banks. The company was acquired by Sentinel Capital Partners from CCMP, a division of J. P. Morgan Partners, on April 14, 2011. The company was acquired by Spirax-Sarco Engineering on May 26, 2017.  History  The company traces its origin to 1915 when a Pittsburgh engineer, Edwin L. Wiegand, received a patent for a resistance heating element embedded in an insulated refractory enclosed in a metal sheath. This electric heating method would eventually be applied to home cooking and heating as well as manufacturing processes. Chromalox incorporated in 1917, with the company's first order for a strip heater used in a product that became the modern household clothes iron. The product had the word \\"chrome\\" stamped on the strip heater and used a cement mix to \\"lock\\" in the heating element, hence the name \\"Chromalox.\\" The company continued to grow and developed a Pittsburgh manufacturing presence in the 1920s, developing new industrial heating products and processes. It expanded into the nuclear industry in the 1950s, supplying pressurizer heaters. Chromalox was also a supplier to the aerospace support industry in the 1960s, with a Chromalox strip heater included on the first Apollo Lunar Module. Chromalox expanded into global markets by acquiring two manufacturing facilities, Grimwood in England, and Etirex in France. In 1977, Chromalox Industrial Controls was born with the purchase of Rosemount Temperature Controls in LaVergne, TN. The controls product lines were diversified and expanded, positioning Chromalox as a leader in the industry. International manufacturing acquisitions continued in the 1990s, and a Hong Kong regional sales office was added in 1993 to service Asian markets.

Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment. Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \\"mechanical-muscle\\" machines or more efficient \\"mechanical-mind\\" processes (automation), and humans' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing's Bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills. That technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs. Whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \\"technological unemployment\\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was a \\"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\\".The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren (1930). E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) SSRN, part 2(2) Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle's time. Prior to the 18th century both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \\"Luddite fallacy\\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment. The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century. In the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their findings have frequently been misinterpreted, and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment. While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again. A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \\"significant issue\\". Regarding a recent claim by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that automation is not \\"going to have any kind of big effect on the economy for the next 50 or 100 years\\", says McAfee, \\"I don't talk to anyone in the field who believes that.\\" Recent technological innovations have the potential to render humans obsolete with the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \\"mental jobs\\". The World Bank's World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance. Issues within the debates =Long term effects on employment= All participants in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation. Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment. Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, compensation effects will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed. While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, labor economists Jacob Mincer and Stephan Danninger developed an empirical study using micro-data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment \\"appears to be a myth\\". The concept of structural unemployment, a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the business cycle, became popular in the 1960s. For pessimists, technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment. Since the 1980s, even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies (ref missing), but they have tended to blame this on globalisation and offshoring rather than technological change. Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment has been the reluctance of governments to pursue expansionary policies since the displacement of Keynesianism that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s. In the 21st century, and especially since 2013, pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat.On the other hand, from a more positive perspective, some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves. The typical management role will, as a result, change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more, rather than less, value. =Compensation effects= John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753, by Ford Madox Brown, depicting the inventor John Kay kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour-saving mechanical loom. Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time. Compensation effects are labour-friendly consequences of innovation which \\"compensate\\" workers for job losses initially caused by new technology. In the 1820s, several compensation effects were described by Say in response to Ricardo's statement that long term technological unemployment could occur. Soon after, a whole system of effects was developed by Ramsey McCulloch. The system was labelled \\"compensation theory\\" by Marx, who proceeded to attack the ideas, arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate. Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since. Compensation effects include: # By new machines. (The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires.) # By new investments. (Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology.) # By changes in wages. (In cases where unemployment does occur, this can cause a lowering of wages, thus allowing more workers to be re-employed at the now lower cost. On the other hand, sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises. This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending, which in turn encourages job creation.) # By lower prices. (Which then lead to more demand, and therefore more employment.) Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts, as cheaper goods will increase workers' buying power. # By new products. (Where innovation directly creates new jobs.) The \\"by new machines\\" effect is now rarely discussed by economists; it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it. Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the \\"by new products\\" effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process' and 'product' innovations.Labour-displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of mechanization, automation, and process improvement. The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines. The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether. The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce, decreasing employment. In practice, the categories often overlap: a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement. The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective, as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient control to be viewed as part of automation. Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation. The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved. One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job multiplier. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector. His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job-creation in high-tech industries might have a more significant spillover effect than we have anticipated. Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect, showing local high-tech jobs could create five additional low-tech jobs. Many economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century. Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective. An early example of this argument was made by Wassily Leontief in 1983. He conceded that after some disruption, the advance of mechanization during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased productivity. While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power, they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive. Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace, there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power. Hence even as productivity continues to rise, the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment. However, this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies. One research done by Erik Brynjolfsson and Lorin M. Hitt in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive short-term effect of computerization on firm-level measured productivity and output growth. In addition, they find the long-term productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater. =The Luddite fallacy= The term \\"Luddite fallacy\\" is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term technological unemployment are committing a fallacy, as they fail to account for compensation effects. People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long-term impact on employment levels, and eventually will raise wages for all workers, because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society. The term is based on the early 19th century example of the Luddites. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a fallacy. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed. There are two underlying premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the lump of labour fallacy, arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour. In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the \\"easy\\" work, (2) the definition of what is \\"easy\\" expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond \\"easy\\" (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment. =Skill levels and technological unemployment= A common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills, while often benefiting skilled workers. According to scholars such as Lawrence F. Katz, this may have been true for much of the twentieth century, yet in the 19th century, innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans, and generally benefited the low skilled. While 21st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work, other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation, while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs. Some recent studies however, such as a 2015 paper by Georg Graetz and Guy Michaels, found that at least in the area they studied ‚Äì the impact of industrial robots ‚Äì innovation is boosting pay for highly skilled workers while having a more negative impact on those with low to medium skills. A 2015 report by Carl Benedikt Frey, Michael Osborne and Citi Research agreed that innovation had been disruptive mostly to middle-skilled jobs, yet predicted that in the next ten years the impact of automation would fall most heavily on those with low skills. Geoff Colvin at Forbes argued that predictions on the kind of work a computer will never be able to do have proven inaccurate. A better approach to anticipate the skills on which humans will provide value would be to find out activities where we will insist that humans remain accountable for important decisions, such as with judges, CEOs, bus drivers and government leaders, or where human nature can only be satisfied by deep interpersonal connections, even if those tasks could be automated. In contrast, others see even skilled human laborers being obsolete. Oxford academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne have predicted computerization could make nearly half of jobs redundant; of the 702 professions assessed, they found a strong correlation between education and income with ability to be automated, with office jobs and service work being some of the more at risk. In 2012 co-founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80% of medical doctors' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. = Empirical findings = There has been a lot of empirical research that attempts to quantify the impact of technological unemployment, mostly done at the microeconomic level. Most existing firm-level research has found a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment. They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation. This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well, which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior. At the industry level, however, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes. A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium- and high-tech sectors. There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment. Limited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment. The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results. Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor-saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States. On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy. Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, unemployment effect of technological change. = Measures of technological innovation = There have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively. The first one, proposed by Jordi Gali in 1999 and further developed by Neville Francis and Valerie A. Ramey in 2005, is to use long-run restrictions in a vector autoregression (VAR) to identify technological shocks, assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity. The second approach is from Susanto Basu, John Fernald and Miles Kimball. They create a measure of aggregate technology change with augmented Solow residuals, controlling for aggregate, non-technological effects such as non-constant returns and imperfect competition. The third method, initially developed by John Shea in 1999, takes a more direct approach and employs observable indicators such as research and development (R&D;) spending, and number of patent applications. This measure of technological innovation is very widely used in empirical research, since it does not rely on the assumption that only technology affects long-run productivity, and fairly accurately captures the output variation based on input variation. However, there are limitations with direct measures such as R&D.; For example, since R&D; only measures the input in innovation, the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input. In addition, R&D; fails to capture the indeterminate lag between developing a new product or service, and bringing it to market. The fourth approach, constructed by Michelle Alexopoulos, looks at the number of new titles published in the fields of technology and computer science to reflect technological progress, which turns out to be consistent with R&D; expenditure data. Compared with R&D;, this indicator captures the lag between changes in technology. History =Pre-16th century= Roman Emperor Vespasian, who refused a low-cost method of transport of heavy goods that would put laborers out of work According to author Gregory Woirol, the phenomenon of technological unemployment is likely to have existed since at least the invention of the wheel. Ancient societies had various methods for relieving the poverty of those unable to support themselves with their own labour. Ancient China and ancient Egypt may have had various centrally run relief programmes in response to technological unemployment dating back to at least the second millennium BC. Ancient Hebrews and adherents of the ancient Vedic religion had decentralised responses where aiding the poor was encouraged by their faiths. In ancient Greece, large numbers of free labourers could find themselves unemployed due to both the effects of ancient labour saving technology and to competition from slaves (\\"machines of flesh and blood\\"). Sometimes, these unemployed workers would starve to death or were forced into slavery themselves although in other cases they were supported by handouts. Pericles responded to perceived technological unemployment by launching public works programmes to provide paid work to the jobless. Conservatives criticized Pericle's programmes for wasting public money but were defeated. Perhaps the earliest example of a scholar discussing the phenomenon of technological unemployment occurs with Aristotle, who speculated in Book One of Politics that if machines could become sufficiently advanced, there would be no more need for human labour. Similar to the Greeks, ancient Romans, responded to the problem of technological unemployment by relieving poverty with handouts. Several hundred thousand families were sometimes supported like this at once. Less often, jobs were directly created with public works programmes, such as those launched by the Gracchi. Various emperors even went as far as to refuse or ban labour saving innovations. In one instance, the introduction of a labor-saving invention was blocked, when Emperor Vespasian refused to allow a new method of low-cost transportation of heavy goods, saying \\"You must allow my poor hauliers to earn their bread.\\"See book eight, chapt XVIII of Suetonius's The Twelve Caesars. Labour shortages began to develop in the Roman empire towards the end of the second century AD, and from this point mass unemployment in Europe appears to have largely receded for over a millennium. The medieval and early renaissance period saw the widespread adoption of newly invented technologies as well as older ones which had been conceived yet barely used in the Classical era. Mass unemployment began to reappear in Europe in the 15th century, partly as a result of population growth, and partly due to changes in the availability of land for subsistence farming caused by early enclosures. As a result of the threat of unemployment, there was less tolerance for disruptive new technologies. European authorities would often side with groups representing subsections of the working population, such as Guilds, banning new technologies and sometimes even executing those who tried to promote or trade in them.On occasion these executions were carried out with methods normally reserved for only the worst criminals, for example on a single occasion in the south of France, 58 people were broken on the Catherine wheel for selling forbidden goods. See Chpt 1 of The Worldly Philosophers. =16th to 18th century= Elizabeth I, who refused to patent a knitting machine invented by William Lee, saying \\"Consider thou what the invention could do to my poor subjects. It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars.\\" In Great Britain, the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe, which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain's early lead in driving the Industrial Revolution.E.g by Sir John Habakkuk in American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century (1962), Cambridge University Press ‚Äì Habakkuk also went on to say that due to labour shortages, compared with their British counterparts there was far less resistance from U.S. workers to the introduction of technology, leading to more update of innovation, and hence to the more efficient American system of manufacturing Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century. A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor William Lee invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine. The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers. After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention, Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth's successor James I for the same reason. Especially after the Glorious Revolution, authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of Mercantilist thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition. From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take direct action, such as machine breaking, in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation. Schumpeter notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with von Justi being a prominent example. Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long-term problem. =19th century= It was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense, especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated. Building on the work of Dean Tucker and Adam Smith, political economists began to create what would become the modern discipline of economics.Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment, but the Dean had, saying in 1757 that in the long term, the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them. While rejecting much of mercantilism, members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem. In the first few decades of the 19th century, several prominent political economists did, however, argue against the optimistic view, claiming that innovation could cause long-term unemployment. These included Sismondi, Malthus, J S Mill, and from 1821, Ricardo himself.While initially of the view that innovation benefited the whole population, Ricardo was persuaded by Malthus that technology could both push down wages for the working class, and cause long- term unemployment. He famously expressed these views in a chapter called \\"on Machinery\\", added to the third and final (1821) edition of On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation As arguably the most respected political economist of his age, Ricardo's view was challenging to others in the discipline. The first major economist to respond was Jean-Baptiste Say, who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product,Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit. and that as Say's Law states that supply creates its own demand, any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust. Ramsey McCulloch expanded and formalised Say's optimistic views on technological unemployment, and was supported by others such as Charles Babbage, Nassau Senior and many other lesser known political economists. Towards the middle of the 19th century, Karl Marx joined the debates. Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill, Marx went much further, presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment; his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed. By the 1870s, at least in Great Britain, technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate. It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society, including the working class. As the classical school of thought gave way to neoclassical economics, mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo. =20th century= Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale. For the first two decades of the 20th century, mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th. While the Marxist school and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view, technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s. In the 1920s mass unemployment re-emerged as a pressing issue within Europe. At this time the U.S. was generally more prosperous, but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927. Rural American workers had been suffering job losses from the start of the 1920s; many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology, such as the tractor. The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States, and it was here that the 20th century's two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred. The peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s. According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol, the two episodes share several similarities. In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern, sparked by recent rises in unemployment. In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled, but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war ‚Äì World War II for the debate of the 1930s, and the Vietnam war for the 1960s episodes. In both cases, the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time, with little reference to earlier thought. In the 1930s, optimists based their arguments largely on neo-classical beliefs in the self- correcting power of markets to automatically reduce any short-term unemployment via compensation effects. In the 1960s, faith in compensation effects was less strong, but the mainstream Keynesian economists of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces. Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode, which broadly found that long-term technological unemployment was not occurring (though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers, and advised government action to provide assistance).In the 1930s, this study was Unemployment and technological change(Report no. G-70, 1940) by Corrington Calhoun Gill of the 'National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques'. Some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment, e.g. Memorandum on Technological Unemployment (1933) by Ewan Clague Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some authorities ‚Äì e.g. Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal (Cambridge University Press, 1991) ‚Äì say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem. Other's though like Bruce Bartlett in Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs (Cato Journal 1984) argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s. In the 1960s episode, the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was Technology and the American economy (1966) by the 'National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress' established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964 As the golden age of capitalism came to a close in the 1970s, unemployment once again rose, and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century, across most advanced economies. Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation, with perhaps the most prominent being Paul Samuelson. Overall, the closing decades of the 20th century saw most concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe, though there were several examples in the U.S. A number of popular works warning of technological unemployment were also published. These included James S. Albus's 1976 book titled Peoples' Capitalism: The Economics of the Robot Revolution;James S. Albus, Peoples' Capitalism: The Economics of the Robot Revolution (free download)James S. Albus, People's Capitalism main website David F. Noble with works published in 1984 and 1993;. Jeremy Rifkin and his 1995 book The End of Work; and the 1996 book The Global Trap.The Global Trap defines a possible \\"20/80 society\\" that may emerge in the 21st century. In this potential society, 20% of the working age population will be enough to keep the world economy going. The authors describe how at a conference at the invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev with 500 leading politicians, business leaders and academics from all continents from 27 September ‚Äì 1 October 1995 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, the term \\"one-fifth-society\\" arose. The authors describe an increase in productivity caused by the decrease in the amount of work, so this could be done by one- fifth of the global labor force and leave four-fifths of the working age people out of work. Yet for the most part, other than during the periods of intense debate in the 1930s and 60s, the consensus in the 20th century among both professional economists and the general public remained that technology does not cause long-term joblessness. =21st century= Opinions The general consensus that innovation does not cause long-term unemployment held strong for the first decade of the 21st century although it continued to be challenged by a number of academic works, and by popular works such as Marshall Brain's Robotic Nation. and Martin Ford's The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future.. Since the publication of their 2011 book Race Against the Machine, MIT professors Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson have been prominent among those raising concern about technological unemployment. The two professors remain relatively optimistic, however, stating \\"the key to winning the race is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines\\".Steve Lohr, More Jobs Predicted for Machines, Not People, book review in The New York Times, 2011.10.23Andrew Keen, Keen On How The Internet Is Making Us Both Richer and More Unequal (TCTV), interview with Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, TechCrunch, 2011.11.15JILL KRASNY, MIT Professors: The 99% Should Shake Their Fists At The Tech Boom, Business Insider, 2011.11.25Scott Timberg, The Clerk, RIP, Salon.com, 2011.12.18Andrew Leonard, Robots are stealing your job: How technology threatens to wipe out the middle class, Salon.com, 2014.01.17 Concern about technological unemployment grew in 2013 due in part to a number of studies predicting substantially increased technological unemployment in forthcoming decades and empirical evidence that, in certain sectors, employment is falling worldwide despite rising output, thus discounting globalization and offshoring as the only causes of increasing unemployment. In 2013, professor Nick Bloom of Stanford University stated there had recently been a major change of heart concerning technological unemployment among his fellow economists. In 2014 the Financial Times reported that the impact of innovation on jobs has been a dominant theme in recent economic discussion. According to the academic and former politician Michael Ignatieff writing in 2014, questions concerning the effects of technological change have been \\"haunting democratic politics everywhere\\". Concerns have included evidence showing worldwide falls in employment across sectors such as manufacturing; falls in pay for low and medium skilled workers stretching back several decades even as productivity continues to rise; the increase in often precarious platform mediated employment; and the occurrence of \\"jobless recoveries\\" after recent recessions. The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research and even low level journalism. Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard economics professor Lawrence Summers stated in 2014 that he no longer believed automation would always create new jobs and that \\"This isn't some hypothetical future possibility. This is something that's emerging before us right now.\\" Summers noted that already, more labor sectors were losing jobs than creating new ones.Other recent statements by Summers include warnings on the \\"devastating consequences\\" for those who perform routine tasks arising from robots, 3-D printing, artificial intelligence, and similar technologies. In his view, \\"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue- collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead.\\" Summers has also said that \\"[T]here are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution. This time around, change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy. [...] [T]here are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs. And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever. [...] If current trends continue, it could well be that a generation from now a quarter of middle-aged men will be out of work at any given moment.\\"As Robots Grow Smarter, American Workers Struggle to Keep Up (2014-12-15), The New York TimesLarry Summers, The Inequality Puzzle, Democracy: A Journal of Ideas, Issue #32, Spring 2014 While himself doubtful about technological unemployment, professor Mark MacCarthy stated in the fall of 2014 that it is now the \\"prevailing opinion\\" that the era of technological unemployment has arrived. At the 2014 Davos meeting, Thomas Friedman reported that the link between technology and unemployment seemed to have been the dominant theme of that year's discussions. A survey at Davos 2014 found that 80% of 147 respondents agreed that technology was driving jobless growth. At the 2015 Davos, Gillian Tett found that almost all delegates attending a discussion on inequality and technology expected an increase in inequality over the next five years, and gives the reason for this as the technological displacement of jobs. 2015 saw Martin Ford win the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award for his Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future, and saw the first world summit on technological unemployment, held in New York. In late 2015, further warnings of potential worsening for technological unemployment came from Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, and from Ignazio Visco, the governor of the Bank of Italy. In an October 2016 interview, US President Barack Obama said that due to the growth of artificial intelligence, society would be debating \\"unconditional free money for everyone\\" within 10 to 20 years. In 2019, computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Stuart J. Russell stated that \\"in the long run nearly all current jobs will go away, so we need fairly radical policy changes to prepare for a very different future economy.\\" In a book he authored, Russell claims that \\"One rapidly emerging picture is that of an economy where far fewer people work because work is unnecessary.\\" However, he predicted that employment in healthcare, home care, and construction would increase. Other economists have argued that long-term technological unemployment is unlikely. In 2014, Pew Research canvassed 1,896 technology professionals and economists and found a split of opinion: 48% of respondents believed that new technologies would displace more jobs than they would create by the year 2025, while 52% maintained that they would not. Economics professor Bruce Chapman from Australian National University has advised that studies such as Frey and Osborne's tend to overstate the probability of future job losses, as they don't account for new employment likely to be created, due to technology, in what are currently unknown areas. General public surveys have often found an expectation that automation would impact jobs widely, but not the jobs held by those particular people surveyed. Studies A number of studies have predicted that automation will take a large proportion of jobs in the future, but estimates of the level of unemployment this will cause vary. Research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of the Oxford Martin School showed that employees engaged in \\"tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms\\" are at risk of displacement. The study, published in 2013, shows that automation can affect both skilled and unskilled work and both high and low-paying occupations; however, low-paid physical occupations are most at risk. It estimated that 47% of US jobs were at high risk of automation. In 2014, the economic think tank Bruegel released a study, based on the Frey and Osborne approach, claiming that across the European Union's 28 member states, 54% of jobs were at risk of automation. The countries where jobs were least vulnerable to automation were Sweden, with 46.69% of jobs vulnerable, the UK at 47.17%, the Netherlands at 49.50%, and France and Denmark, both at 49.54%. The countries where jobs were found to be most vulnerable were Romania at 61.93%, Portugal at 58.94%, Croatia at 57.9%, and Bulgaria at 56.56%. A 2015 report by the Taub Center found that 41% of jobs in Israel were at risk of being automated within the next two decades. In January 2016, a joint study by the Oxford Martin School and Citibank, based on previous studies on automation and data from the World Bank, found that the risk of automation in developing countries was much higher than in developed countries. It found that 77% of jobs in China, 69% of jobs in India, 85% of jobs in Ethiopia, and 55% of jobs in Uzbekistan were at risk of automation. The World Bank similarly employed the methodology of Frey and Osborne. A 2016 study by the International Labour Organization found 74% of salaried electrical & electronics industry positions in Thailand, 75% of salaried electrical & electronics industry positions in Vietnam, 63% of salaried electrical & electronics industry positions in Indonesia, and 81% of salaried electrical & electronics industry positions in the Philippines were at high risk of automation. A 2016 United Nations report stated that 75% of jobs in the developing world were at risk of automation, and predicted that more jobs might be lost when corporations stop outsourcing to developing countries after automation in industrialized countries makes it less lucrative to outsource to countries with lower labor costs. The Council of Economic Advisers, a US government agency tasked with providing economic research for the White House, in the 2016 Economic Report of the President, used the data from the Frey and Osborne study to estimate that 83% of jobs with an hourly wage below $20, 31% of jobs with an hourly wage between $20 and $40, and 4% of jobs with an hourly wage above $40 were at risk of automation. A 2016 study by Ryerson University found that 42% of jobs in Canada were at risk of automation, dividing them into two categories - \\"high risk\\" jobs and \\"low risk\\" jobs. High risk jobs were mainly lower-income jobs that required lower education levels than average. Low risk jobs were on average more skilled positions. The report found a 70% chance that high risk jobs and a 30% chance that low risk jobs would be affected by automation in the next 10‚Äì20 years. A 2017 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that up to 38% of jobs in the US, 35% of jobs in Germany, 30% of jobs in the UK, and 21% of jobs in Japan were at high risk of being automated by the early 2030s. A 2017 study by Ball State University found about half of American jobs were at risk of automation, many of them low-income jobs. A September 2017 report by McKinsey & Company found that as of 2015, 478 billion out of 749 billion working hours per year dedicated to manufacturing, or $2.7 trillion out of $5.1 trillion in labor, were already automatable. In low-skill areas, 82% of labor in apparel goods, 80% of agriculture processing, 76% of food manufacturing, and 60% of beverage manufacturing were subject to automation. In mid-skill areas, 72% of basic materials production and 70% of furniture manufacturing was automatable. In high-skill areas, 52% of aerospace and defense labor and 50% of advanced electronics labor could be automated. In October 2017, a survey of information technology decision makers in the US and UK found that a majority believed that most business processes could be automated by 2022. On average, they said that 59% of business processes were subject to automation. A November 2017 report by the McKinsey Global Institute that analyzed around 800 occupations in 46 countries estimated that between 400 million and 800 million jobs could be lost due to robotic automation by 2030. It estimated that jobs were more at risk in developed countries than developing countries due to a greater availability of capital to invest in automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation has been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist and protectionist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries. However, not all recent empirical studies have found evidence to support the idea that automation will cause widespread unemployment. A study released in 2015, examining the impact of industrial robots in 17 countries between 1993 and 2007, found no overall reduction in employment was caused by the robots, and that there was a slight increase in overall wages. According to a study published in McKinsey Quarterly in 2015 the impact of computerization in most cases is not replacement of employees but automation of portions of the tasks they perform. A 2016 OECD study found that among the 21 OECD countries surveyed, on average only 9% of jobs were in foreseeable danger of automation, but this varied greatly among countries: for example in South Korea the figure of at-risk jobs was 6% while in Austria it was 12%. In contrast to other studies, the OECD study does not primarily base its assessment on the tasks that a job entails, but also includes demographic variables, including sex, education and age. It is not clear however why a job should be more or less automatise just because it is performed by a woman. In 2017, Forrester estimated that automation would result in a net loss of about 7% of jobs in the US by 2027, replacing 17% of jobs while creating new jobs equivalent to 10% of the workforce. Another study argued that the risk of US jobs to automation had been overestimated due to factors such as the heterogeneity of tasks within occupations and the adaptability of jobs being neglected. The study found that once this was taken into account, the number of occupations at risk to automation in the US drops, ceteris paribus, from 38% to 9%.Arntz, Melanie; Gregory, Terry; Zierahn, Ulrich \\"Revisiting the Risk of Automation\\", accessed 06/11/2017 A 2017 study on the effect of automation on Germany found no evidence that automation caused total job losses but that they do effect the jobs people are employed in; losses in the industrial sector due to automation were offset by gains in the service sector. Manufacturing workers were also not at risk from automation and were in fact more likely to remain employed, though not necessarily doing the same tasks. However, automation did result in a decrease in labour's income share as it raised productivity but not wages.Dauth, Wolfgang; Findeisen, Sebastian; Suedekum, Jens; Woessner, Nicole \\"German Robots - The Impact of Industrial Robots on Workers\\", accessed 06/11/2017 A 2018 Brookings Institution study that analyzed 28 industries in 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2018 found that automation was responsible for holding down wages. Although it concluded that automation did not reduce the overall number of jobs available and even increased them, it found that from the 1970s to the 2010s, it had reduced the share of human labor in the value added to the work, and thus had helped to slow wage growth. In April 2018, Adair Turner, former Chairman of the Financial Services Authority and head of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, stated that it would already be possible to automate 50% of jobs with current technology, and that it will be possible to automate all jobs by 2060. Premature deindustrialization Premature deindustrialization occurs when developing nations deindustrialize without first becoming rich, as happened with the advanced economies. The concept was popularized by Dani Rodrik in 2013, who went on to publish several papers showing the growing empirical evidence for the phenomena. Premature deindustrialization adds to concern over technological unemployment for developing countries - as traditional compensation effects that advanced economy workers enjoyed, such being able to get well paid work in the service sector after losing their factory jobs - may not be available. Some commentators, such as Carl Benedikt Frey, argue that with the right responses, the negative effects of further automation on workers in developing economies can still be avoided.  Artificial intelligence  Since about 2017, a new wave of concern over technological unemployment had become prominent, this time over the effects of artificial intelligence (AI). Commentators including Calum Chace and Daniel Hulme have warned that if unchecked, AI threatens to cause an \\"economic singularity\\", with job churn too rapid for humans to adapt to, leading to widespread technological unemployment. Though they also advise that with the right responses by business leaders, policy makers and society, the impact of AI could be a net positive for workers. Morgan R. Frank et al. cautions that there are several barriers preventing researchers from making accurate predictions of the effects AI will have on future job markets. Marian Krakovsky has argued that the jobs most likely to be completely replaced by AI are in middle-class areas, such as professional services. Often, the practical solution is to find another job, but workers may not have the qualifications for high-level jobs and so must drop to lower level jobs. However, Krakovsky (2018) predicts that AI will largely take the route of \\"complementing people,\\" rather than \\"replicating people.\\" Suggesting that the goal of people implementing AI is to improve the life of workers, not replace them. Studies have also shown that rather than solely destroying jobs AI can also create work: albeit low-skill jobs to train AI in low-income countries. Following President Putin's 2017 statement that which ever country first achieves mastery in AI \\"will become the ruler of the world\\", various national and supranational governments have announced AI strategies. Concerns on not falling behind in the AI arms race have been more prominent than worries over AI's potential to cause unemployment. Several strategies suggest that achieving a leading role in AI should help their citizens get more rewarding jobs. Finland has aimed to help the citizens of other EU nations acquire the skills they need to compete in the post AI jobs market, making a free course on \\"The Elements of AI\\" available in multiple European languages. Solutions  =Preventing net job losses= Banning/refusing innovation \\"What I object to, is the craze for machinery, not machinery as such. The craze is for what they call labour-saving machinery. Men go on 'saving labour', till thousands are without work and thrown on the open streets to die of starvation.\\" ‚Äî Gandhi, 1924For a small collection of quotes by Gandhi relating to his view that innovation should be slowed while unemployment exists see The place of machines Historically, innovations were sometimes banned due to concerns about their impact on employment. Since the development of modern economics, however, this option has generally not even been considered as a solution, at least not for the advanced economies. Even commentators who are pessimistic about long-term technological unemployment invariably consider innovation to be an overall benefit to society, with J. S. Mill being perhaps the only prominent western political economist to have suggested prohibiting the use of technology as a possible solution to unemployment. Gandhian economics called for a delay in the uptake of labour saving machines until unemployment was alleviated, however this advice was largely rejected by Nehru who was to become prime minister once India achieved its independence. The policy of slowing the introduction of innovation so as to avoid technological unemployment was, however, implemented in the 20th century within China under Mao's administration. Shorter working hours In 1870, the average American worker clocked up about 75 hours per week. Just prior to World War II working hours had fallen to about 42 per week, and the fall was similar in other advanced economies. According to Wassily Leontief, this was a voluntary increase in technological unemployment. The reduction in working hours helped share out available work, and was favoured by workers who were happy to reduce hours to gain extra leisure, as innovation was at the time generally helping to increase their rates of pay. Further reductions in working hours have been proposed as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including John R. Commons, Lord Keynes and Luigi Pasinetti. Yet once working hours have reached about 40 hours per week, workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions, both to prevent loss of income and as many value engaging in work for its own sake. Generally, 20th-century economists had argued against further reductions as a solution to unemployment, saying it reflects a lump of labour fallacy. In 2014, Google's co-founder, Larry Page, suggested a four-day workweek, so as technology continues to displace jobs, more people can find employment.Larry Page discusses his views on the socioeconomic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in Peter Diamandis' book), provide for people's needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate any potential detrimental effects of technological unemployment. 2014-07-03. Discussion with Sergey Brin and Vinod Khosla. Starting at about 13:00 into the video. The audience is composed of the CEOs of the portfolio companies of Khosla Ventures.FT interview with Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page (2014-10-31), The Financial Times Public works Programmes of public works have traditionally been used as way for governments to directly boost employment, though this has often been opposed by some, but not all, conservatives. Jean- Baptiste Say, although generally associated with free market economics, advised that public works could be a solution to technological unemployment. Some commentators, such as professor Mathew Forstater, have advised that public works and guaranteed jobs in the public sector may be the ideal solution to technological unemployment, as unlike welfare or guaranteed income schemes they provide people with the social recognition and meaningful engagement that comes with work. For less developed economies, public works may be an easier to administrate solution compared to universal welfare programmes. As of 2015, calls for public works in the advanced economies have been less frequent even from progressives, due to concerns about sovereign debt. A partial exception is for spending on infrastructure, which has been recommended as a solution to technological unemployment even by economists previously associated with a neoliberal agenda, such as Larry Summers. Education Improved availability to quality education, including skills training for adults and other active labour market policies, is a solution that in principle at least is not opposed by any side of the political spectrum, and welcomed even by those who are optimistic about long-term technological employment. Improved education paid for by government tends to be especially popular with industry.https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-04/big-tech-wants- you-to-believe-america-has-a-skills-gap Proponents of this brand of policy assert higher level, more specialized learning is a way to capitalize from the growing technology industry. Leading technology research university MIT published an open letter to policymakers advocating for the \\"reinvention of education\\", namely a shift \\"away from rote learning\\" and towards STEM disciplines. Similar statements released by the U.S President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PACST) have also been used to support this STEM emphasis on enrollment choice in higher learning. Education reform is also a part of the U.K government's \\"Industrial Strategy\\", a plan announcing the nation's intent to invest millions into a \\"technical education system\\". The proposal includes the establishment of a retraining program for workers who wish to adapt their skill-sets. These suggestions combat the concerns over automation through policy choices aiming to meet the emerging needs of society via updated information. Of the professionals within the academic community who applaud such moves, often noted is a gap between economic security and formal education ‚Äîa disparity exacerbated by the rising demand for specialized skills‚Äîand education's potential to reduce it. However, several academics have also argued that improved education alone will not be sufficient to solve technological unemployment, pointing to recent declines in the demand for many intermediate skills, and suggesting that not everyone is capable in becoming proficient in the most advanced skills. Kim Taipale has said that \\"The era of bell curve distributions that supported a bulging social middle class is over... Education per se is not going to make up the difference.\\" while an op- ed piece from 2011, Paul Krugman, an economics professor and columnist for the New York Times, argued that better education would be an insufficient solution to technological unemployment, as it \\"actually reduces the demand for highly educated workers\\". =Living with technological unemployment= Welfare payments The use of various forms of subsidies has often been accepted as a solution to technological unemployment even by conservatives and by those who are optimistic about the long term effect on jobs. Welfare programmes have historically tended to be more durable once established, compared with other solutions to unemployment such as directly creating jobs with public works. Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing compensation effects, Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment, as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour-saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts. =Basic income= Several commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment, and have suggested a basic income as an alternative. People advocating some form of basic income as a solution to technological unemployment include Martin Ford, Erik Brynjolfsson, Robert Reich, Andrew Yang, Elon Musk, Zoltan Istvan, and Guy Standing. Reich has gone as far as to say the introduction of a basic income, perhaps implemented as a negative income tax is \\"almost inevitable\\", while Standing has said he considers that a basic income is becoming \\"politically essential\\". Since late 2015, new basic income pilots have been announced in Finland, the Netherlands, and Canada. Further recent advocacy for basic income has arisen from a number of technology entrepreneurs, the most prominent being Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator. Skepticism about basic income includes both right and left elements, and proposals for different forms of it have come from all segments of the spectrum. For example, while the best-known proposed forms (with taxation and distribution) are usually thought of as left-leaning ideas that right-leaning people try to defend against, other forms have been proposed even by libertarians, such as von Hayek and Friedman. Republican president Nixon's Family Assistance Plan (FAP) of 1969, which had much in common with basic income, passed in the House but was defeated in the Senate. One objection to basic income is that it could be a disincentive to work, but evidence from older pilots in India, Africa, and Canada indicates that this does not happen and that a basic income encourages low-level entrepreneurship and more productive, collaborative work. Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge. While new revenue-raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford's wage recapture tax, how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question, and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian. Even from a progressive viewpoint, there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable, especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare.. To better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control, one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector. Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans, but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation, and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained. This would be a for-profit sector analog of basic income, that is, a market-based form of basic income. It differs from a job guarantee in that the government is not the employer (rather, companies are) and there is no aspect of having employees who \\"cannot be fired\\", a problem that interferes with economic dynamism. The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job, but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20% of the population. Another option for a market-based form of basic income has been proposed by the Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ) as part of \\"a Just Third Way\\" (a Third Way with greater justice) through widely distributed power and liberty. Called the Capital Homestead Act, it is reminiscent of James S. Albus's Peoples' Capitalism in that money creation and securities ownership are widely and directly distributed to individuals rather than flowing through, or being concentrated in, centralized or elite mechanisms. Broadening the ownership of technological assets Several solutions have been proposed which do not fall easily into the traditional left-right political spectrum. This includes broadening the ownership of robots and other productive capital assets. Enlarging the ownership of technologies has been advocated by people including James S. Albus John Lanchester,Lanchester, John (March 2015). The Robots Are Coming, Vol. 37, No. 5, pages 3-8, London Review of Books Richard B. Freeman, and Noah Smith. Jaron Lanier has proposed a somewhat similar solution: a mechanism where ordinary people receive \\"nano payments\\" for the big data they generate by their regular surfing and other aspects of their online presence. Structural changes towards a post- scarcity economy The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM), The Venus Project (TVP) as well as various individuals and organizations propose structural changes towards a form of a post-scarcity economy in which people are 'freed' from their automatable, monotonous jobs, instead of 'losing' their jobs. In the system proposed by TZM all jobs are either automated, abolished for bringing no true value for society (such as ordinary advertising), rationalized by more efficient, sustainable and open processes and collaboration or carried out based on altruism and social relevance (see also: Whuffie), opposed to compulsion or monetary gain. The movement also speculates that the free time made available to people will permit a renaissance of creativity, invention, community and social capital as well as reducing stress. =Other approaches= The threat of technological unemployment has occasionally been used by free market economists as a justification for supply side reforms, to make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers. Conversely, it has also been used as a reason to justify an increase in employee protection. Labour's Declining Share - A Spectre to Worry About?, The Economist, 2013.11.05 Economists including Larry Summers have advised a package of measures may be needed. He advised vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \\"myriad devices\\" ‚Äì such as tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage ‚Äì which enable the holders of great wealth to avoid paying taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \\"great social contributions\\" in return. Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; reductions in \\"excessive\\" protection for intellectual property; greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation; strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements; improvements in corporate governance; strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity; easing of land-use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value; better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers; and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development, such as energy production and transportation. Michael Spence has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion. Adapting to them \\"will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution\\".Spence also wrote that \\"Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors ‚Äì think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.\\" In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. \\"Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.\\" Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \\"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor.\\" For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is \\"easy to imagine\\" that production may become \\"extremely\\" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. \\"Meanwhile, the impact of robotics ... is not confined to production. Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples, the impact on logistics is no less transformative. Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore, one of the most efficient in the world.\\" Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor- intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear globally. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion.Michael Spence, Labor‚Äôs Digital Displacement (2014-05-22), Project Syndicate See also * Autonomous car * Disruptive innovation * Emerging technologies * Futures studies * Humans Need Not Apply * Industrial society * Player Piano * Post- work society * Robot tax * Technological revolution * Technological transitions * Technophobia * The Future of Work and Death * The Triple Revolution * Working time  Notes   References  = Citations = =Sources=   .

Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had approved a deal to build s worth US$3 billion (Rupees 19,000 crores) with Thales, France in October 2005. The investigating agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), found no evidence of corruption in the deal in 2008. Scorp√®ne-class submarines are now being built in India under a technology transfer agreement that was part of that contract. Allegations and investigation The amount of US$ 175 million was allegedly channeled and paid to middleman billionaire arms dealer Abhishek Verma who is known as the Lord of War and is the prime accused in the Navy War Room spy scandal and many other defense scandals in India. The investigation moved very slowly. In 2007, Prashant Bhushan of the Centre for Public Interest Litigation filed a petition with the Delhi High Court to investigate whether there had been kickbacks in the deal. The Delhi High Court took a strong line with the investigating agency CBI, saying \\"We feel dissatisfied with what you've done so far.

The series was first announced in the July issue of Shogakukan's CoroCoro Comic, and has gaming company Level-5's President Akihiro Hino in charge of the story. This installment of the Gundam meta-series is set on a futuristic Earth plagued by an interplanetary war that spans a whole century. Its story revolves around three protagonists from the same family, each piloting his own version of the eponymous mecha, fighting to defend Earth and its space colonies from an enemy race far more advanced in terms of technology. The series was officially unveiled by Bandai on June 13, 2011, during a special event at the 2011 Tokyo Toy Show. Gundam AGE premiered on the MBS and TBS broadcasting stations in Japan on October 9, 2011 and 49 episodes were broadcast, with the final episode on September 23, 2012. A compilation OVA titled Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: Memory of Eden was released on July 26, 2013, focusing on the second protagonist of the series, Asemu Asuno. Plot The story of Gundam AGE is separated into four arcs, with the first three focusing on a different protagonist, and the last, the \\"Three Generations\\" arc, focusing on all three previous protagonists. =Flit Asuno (A.G 115)= In A.G. 101 (the 101st year of the Advanced Generation calendar) a mysterious entity known at the time only as \\"UE\\", or \\"Unknown Enemy\\", attacks and destroys the space colony Angel. This brutal attack becomes infamous as \\"The Day the Angel Fell\\", and marks the beginning of the \\"One Hundred Years War\\". The series begins in A.G. 108 when the UE attack the space colony Ovan, where Flit Asuno lives with his mother after they escaped colony Angel before its destruction. Flit's mother is mortally wounded by the UE, but before dying she gives her son the \\"AGE Device\\", containing the blueprints for a powerful weapon from the past‚Äîthe ancient messiah named \\"Gundam.\\" Flit spends the next several years studying engineering at an Earth Federation base on the Nora space colony while designing the Gundam AGE-1 from the AGE Device's blueprints. Seven years later, in A.G. 115, Flit completes the Gundam AGE-1 Normal, just as the UE attacks Nora, and makes use of it to aid the crew of Federation's battleship \\"Diva\\" in evacuating the colony's citizens before it is destroyed. Determined to bring the battle to the U.E. for destroying his home twice, Flit agrees to serve at Diva's mobile suit squad piloting the Gundam. After gathering enough intel and military power to establish a course of action, the crew of Diva and their allies launch a successful attack to destroy the U.E.'s secret fortress in the Ambat asteroid. In the occasion, they learn that the U.E. are actually the descendants of a failed human mission sent to colonize Mars, left for dead by the Earth Federation, who formed their own nation on the red planet called \\"Vagan\\". =Asemu Asuno (A.G 140-142)= 25 years after the battle at Ambat, the Federation's war against Vagan keeps escalating with no end at sight as their enemies rejected all offers for a peace treaty. Flit, now married and father of two is a commander of the Earth forces determined to destroy the Vagans and chooses his son Asemu to succeed him as the Gundam's pilot, entrusting him with the AGE Device on his 17th birthday. After successfully defending his colony from Vagan attacks with the Gundam AGE-1, Asemu enlists into the military and just like his father before him, he joins Diva's mobile suit squad piloting AGE-1's successor unit, the Gundam AGE-2. Under Flit's command, the federation forces, spearheaded by Asemu and the crew of Diva successfully stops several Vagan attempts to progress with their invasion of Earth. Flit also manages to expose a large scale conspiracy involving several corrupt authorities in cahoots with the Vagans, leading to a massive shift of power in the Earth Sphere. Ten years later, just after the birth of his son Kio, Asemu leaves for a final mission that ends with his disappearance, although his AGE Device was retrieved and entrusted to Kio. =Kio Asuno/Three Generations (A.G 164)= After deploying several sleeper agents around the globe, the Vagans launch a surprise attack that finally brings the war to the Earth. To counter the invasion, Flit activates the recently completed Gundam AGE-3 and entrusts it to Kio. Just like his father and grandfather before him, Kio enlists into the Diva as part of its mobile suit squad to confront the Vagans. Just after reaching space, Flit and Kio has an encounter with the Bisidian space pirates, and discover, much to their surprise, that Asemu is still alive and working with them, piloting a heavily modified version of his Gundam AGE-2, named the Gundam AGE-2 Dark Hound. The Diva's crew learn from Asemu about the existence of EXA-DB, an ancient military database containing strategic data that can provide an overwhelming advantage to whoever side secures it. However, their plans to retrieve it are halted when Kio is captured along with his Gundam by the Vagans and put under custody of their leader Fezarl Ezelcant. Soon after Kio is rescued by Asemu and his pirate comrades, but his Gundam AGE-3 is almost totally destroyed. After returning to Earth, Kio rejoins the crew of Diva piloting the AGE System's ultimate mobile suit, the Gundam AGE-FX. Fighting together for the first time, Flit, Asemu and Kio lead the federal forces and the Bisidian in a successful attempt to recapture the Federation's main base on the moon from the Vagans. After Asemu locates and destroys the EXA-DB to ensure that neither side claims it, the Earth Federation and the Vagans focus all their efforts in one final battle at Earth's orbit. The battle ends when the Vagan main colony \\"Second Moon\\" is about to be destroyed, and Kio convinces Flit to abandon his grief and rally both the Federation and Vagan soldiers to work together and save the colony. After the conflict, the Federation and the Vagans make use of their military research to finally render the planet Mars habitable and Flit becomes remembered as a savior who united all mankind for a brighter future. Production =Development= Development of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE began when Akihiro Hino and Level-5 were first hired by Sunrise to develop a Gundam video game. Interested with working for the Gundam franchise, Hino wrote a plot summary for an anime which Bandai eventually saw and decided to create an anime based on it. The script was eventually green-lit and was first announced in the July issue of Shogakukan's CoroCoro Comic. Many of the staff behind Gundam AGE is also the same staff members who created the previous series Mobile Suit Gundam 00. Susumu Yamaguchi, who previously worked as a director in the Sgt Frog franchise, was in charge of the direction of the series. Michinori Chiba and Takuz≈ç Nagano were both in charge of the character designs of the series while Kanetake Ebikawa, Junya Ishigaki, and Kenji Teraoka were all contributing to the mechanical designs. The series was originally plan to be a year-and-a-half long in length; however, sometime during broadcast, it was determined that the show be cut short to the final length of 49 episodes. Gundam AGE thus followed Mobile Suit Gundam and After War Gundam X as Gundam series that were cut short.Newtype November 2012 issue On February 20, 2013, it was officially announced a new OVA project titled Gundam AGE: Memories of Eden recompiling the second arc of the anime series which focused on protagonist Asemu Asuno and his major antagonist, Zeheart Gallete. The OVA features new footage totaling one hour. =Release= Mobile Suit Gundam AGE premiered at October 9, 2011 on the terrestrial MBS and TBS networks at 5:00 p.m on Sundays, replacing Blue Exorcist. =Music= The music in the series is composed by Kei Yoshikawa, most famous for composing musical scores for the anime Basquash!. The first opening song, \\"Asu e\\" by Galileo Galilei and the ending, by Minami Kuribayashi were used from episodes 1 to 15. From episodes 16 to 28, \\"Sharp#\\" by Negoto and \\"My World\\" by Spyair were used as the opening and ending themes, respectively. From episode 29 to 39, the opening theme was \\"Real\\" by Vivid, and the ending theme was \\"White Justice\\" by Faylan. Episode 40 onwards has \\"Aurora\\" by Aoi Eir as the opening and \\"Forget-me-not (Wasurenagusa)\\" by Flower as the ending. Media =Manga= Two manga adaptations of the series have been announced. by Hiroshi Nakanishi was published in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday. This two-chapter adaptation of the beginning of the anime features a different AGE System from the show. Instead of using the AGE Builder, Gundam AGE-1 is able to analyze its surroundings and incorporate machinery that are appropriate for the combat situation it is in. The other adaptation is published in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace, titled Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: First Evolution, was drawn by Hiyon Katsuragi and serialized from December 2011 to August 2012 issues. It is compiled into three tank≈çbon volumes Two sidestory manga have also been released. The first is entitled Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: Treasure Star. Written and drawn by Masanori Yoshida and serialized in Shogakukan's CoroCoro Comic, it features a group of adventurers exploring space in the ship \\"Treasure Star\\". The second sidestory manga titled Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: Memories of Sid is serialized in Sh≈çnen Sunday S on January 25, 2012 and ended on October 25, 2012. Drawn by Hiroshi Nakanishi, the story is set before the third generation, dealing with Asemu's first encounter with the EXA-DB and SID. It also shows his decision to fake his death and join the Space Pirate Group Bisidian. The series is compiled into three tank≈çbon volumes. =Models and toys= During the announcement event, Bandai had the first several Gundam AGE models and toys on display at the Tokyo Toy Show 2011. Some of them were a 1/48 scale mega-size model of the AGE-1 Gundam AGE-1 Normal and several HG 1/144 scale models of the main mobile suits from the series. The HG Gundam AGE-1 Normal was first released in September 2011 while the Genoace, Genoace Custom, Baqto, Zedas, Garfan, Gundam AGE-1 Titus and Gundam AGE-1 Sparrow will be released in a later date.

Miller School of Medicine, is a center for ophthalmic care, research, and education. Faculty and staff treat patients from around the world in facilities in Miami- Dade County, Broward County, Palm Beach County, and Collier County. The Institute's full-time faculty and researchers encompass many ophthalmic sub- specialties and has been consistently ranked as the #1 eye hospital and vision research center in the country by US News & World Report. The Institute's clinical faculty treats more than 250,000 patients each year, provides 24-hour emergency care, and is the only community-based ophthalmic care for indigent and low-income patients of Miami-Dade County. History Bascom Palmer Eye Institute was founded by Edward W.D. Norton, M.D., a neuro-ophthalmologist, retinal specialist, administrator and teacher, who joined the University of Miami School of Medicine with dreams of building a regional ophthalmic center in South Florida. The Institute was named after Dr. Bascom H. Palmer, a Miami ophthalmologist who settled in Miami in the 1920s. Ophthalmology at the School of Medicine began in 1955 and attained departmental status in 1959 one year after Dr. Norton became the first full-time chairman. The ‚Äúfounding five‚Äù physicians of the Institute included Dr. Norton and four others: Dr. Victor Curtin, the first faculty member who was hired in 1959. He established the Pathology Laboratory and the Eye Bank, which through the auspices of the Florida Lions, has provided ophthalmologists with donor eye tissue for more than 30,000 patients since its founding in 1962. Dr. J. Lawton Smith, a neuro- ophthalmologist created the nation's first post-graduate neuro-ophthalmology course.\\"Dr. Joseph Lawton Smith\\" Miami Herald, 1/13/2011 Dr. J. Donald M.

The Institute was officially opened on January 20, 1962. John Clarkson, M.D., a vitreoretinal specialist and surgeon, succeeded Dr. Norton in 1991 and chaired the Institute until 1996. Richard Parrish, M.D., a glaucoma sub-specialist, became the Institute's third chairman in 1996 and served for three years. Richard Forster, M.D., a cornea and external disease specialist served as interim chairman from 1999 until 2001. Carmen A. Puliafito, M.D., M.B.A., a vitreoretinal specialist and surgeon, was appointed chairman of the Institute and medical director of Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital in July 2001 and served until October 2007. Eduardo C. Alfonso, M.D., a cornea and external disease specialist is currently leading Bascom Palmer Eye Institute as its chairman. Medical firsts In the beginning of the Institute's development, Bascom Palmer physicians, Noble J. David, J. Lawton Smith, Edward W. D. Norton and especially J.Donald M. Gass along with a young medical photographer, Johnny Justice, Jr., pioneered the use of fluorescein angiography for the diagnosis of macular and retinal diseases, which led to the accurate description and effective treatment of retinal disorders. Bascom Palmer surgeons performed the first modified osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis surgery in the United States and restored vision to a woman who had been blind for 9 years. The procedure involved several surgeries culminating in implanting her tooth in her eye, as a base to hold a prosthetic lens.Cox L, \\"Blind Woman Sees With 'Tooth-in-Eye' Surgery\\", ABC News/Health, 9/17/2009 Bascom Palmer physicians and scientists pioneered studies into the effective treatment of the wet form of age-related macular degeneration using the FDA-approved colo-rectal cancer drug, Avastin. Bascom Palmer faculty member, Robert H. Machemer conducted the first successful vitreous surgery and was responsible for the invention of miniature surgical instrumentation required for the procedure Bascom Palmer Research Investigators established the clinical value of vitrectomy (removal of the vitreous humor) to treat retinal detachments, diabetic retinopathy, infectious diseases of the eye and severe ocular trauma. Bascom Palmer researchers identified the herpes virus as the cause of acute retinal necrosis, a devastating infection of the retina often associated with AIDS. In a successful effort to restore the vitality to ocular mucus membranes, Bascom Palmer faculty introduced limbal cell transplantation therapy, which now can prevent potentially blinding corneal scarring.

The family were, until the early 20th century, owners of Barr Beacon.  Early baronets  The third Baronet had already succeeded to the Bateman Baronetcy of Hartington Hall when he inherited the baronetcy in 1851. However, the two titles separated on the death of the sixth Baronet in 1905, when the Bateman Baronetcy was inherited by the fourth Fuller-Acland-Hood baronets of St Audries. The sixth Baronet, Sir Edward Dolman Scott, was a distinguished naval man, Commander of HMS Marlborough and HMS Centurion (1844).  Seventh Baronet  The seventh Baronet, the Reverend Sir Douglas Edward Scott, an only child whose father died when he was just nine months old, was declared bankrupt while curate-in- charge of Winterbourne, Dorset, and again in 1914 while rector of Teffont Evias near Salisbury. He was convicted of bigamy in 1918 and imprisoned. His grandfather was the Reverend William Scott, rector of Aldridge. His uncles were the Reverend William Henry Scott, first vicar of Great Barr, and major- general Douglas Scott of the Madras Army. At the time of his death in 1951, the seventh Baronet was living as the paying lodger of a married couple in a small bungalow in Wokingham.  Eighth Baronet  The eighth Baronet Edward Arthur Dolman Scott, known as Ted, emigrated to Australia at the age of 17, and was living in the Adelaide suburb of South Plympton when elevated to the Baronetcy. He worked as a house painter and died of cancer in January 1980. His wife Lady Scott, a hairdresser, was paid thousands of Australian dollars in an out-of-court settlement after suing Bowater-Scott, who had invited customers to \\"have an affair with Lady Scott\\", as part of an advertising campaign for toilet paper, featuring a fictitious character of that name. Their only child was a daughter, Jeanette, who could not inherit the male-only baronetcy. Ted had a younger brother, Douglas Francis (born 1908) who did not claim the baronetcy, reputedly due to a head injury, and another brother, John Esmond, who had died in 1938 aged 24.

It is also home to the Northern Virginia Fine Arts Association since 1964. The building is an important example of Greek Revival architecture. The Athenaeum has a long history and has served several purposes during its lifetime. The building is now part of the Virginia Trust and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History The land on which the edifice hosting the museum was built belonged to William Fairfax; it was surveyed by George Washington. The building was constructed between 1851 and 1852 at the intersection of Lee and Prince streets to serve as the office of the Bank of the Old Dominion, where it is reported that Robert E. Lee had an account. The bank was at the head of the Captains' Row, a block of 18th-century buildings that still face the cobblestone street. The Bank of the Old Dominion operated at the site until the Civil War, when Alexandria was occupied by the Union forces and the building became the abode of the U.S. Commissary Quartermaster. The Bank of the Old Dominion closed its doors in 1862, but the building again hosted a bank, this time the First Virginia Bank, in the years from 1870 to 1907. In 1907 the building started to be used by the pharmaceutical wholesalers Leadbeater and Sons, one of the oldest Alexandria firms. In 1925 the property passed to the Free Methodist Church of North America, which used it until 1964, when the Northern Virginia Fine Arts Association (NVFAA) purchased the building. The NVFAA still owns the property, which is used for several purposes, mainly for fine arts exhibitions. It was formerly a satellite office to the Washington School of Ballet. The Athenaeum is part of the Virginia Trust and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building, also known as the Old Dominion Bank Building, is one of the few privately owned buildings in Alexandria open to the public and thus depends largely on community donations for its survival.

The channel begins at the northwestern tip of Columbia Island extends southward between Columbia Island and the Virginia shoreline. It curves around the southern tip of Columbia Island before heading northeast to exit into the Potomac River. At the southwestern tip of Columbia Island, the Boundary Channel widens into the manmade Pentagon Lagoon. History of Boundary Channel Columbia Island is in part natural, and in part man-made. About 1818, Analostan Island (now known as Theodore Roosevelt Island) was largely rock and quite close to the D.C. shoreline. Due to deforestation and increased agricultural use upstream, the river eroded much of the northern bank of the Potomac River and widened the gap between Analostan Island and the shore. Simultaneously, large deposits of silt built up around Analostan Island. By 1838, Analostan had almost doubled in length toward the south. By 1884, the new southern part of Analostan Island was defined and built up, and supported a well-established wetland. Gradually, however, the river eroded the center of Analostan Island, severing Columbia Island from its parent body.Office of Conservation, Interpretation, and Use, p. 48-49; Moore and Jackson, p. 91. Between 1911 and 1922, the Potomac River was repeatedly dredged by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to deepen the channel and alleviate flooding. Dredging widened the distance between Analostan/Theodore Roosevelt Island and Columbia Island (so that the \\"Virginia Channel\\" west of Analostan/Roosevelt Island would not flood easily). Dredged material was piled high on Columbia Island, helping to build it higher, lengthen and broaden it, and give it its current shape. The new island received its name about 1918 from an unnamed engineer working for the District of Columbia.Secrest, Meryle. \\"Park Named for Mrs. Johnson.\\" The Washington Post. November 13, 1968. An anonymous Corps of Engineers officer named the waterway between Columbia Island and Virginia the \\"Boundary Channel\\".Corps of Engineers, p. 533. Accessed 2013-05-07. Boundary Channel was further defined in the late 1920s. In 1925, Congress authorized construction of the Arlington Memorial Bridge across the Potomac River. Preliminary designs for the bridge showed it terminating on Columbia Island,\\"Island to Be Remade in New Bridge Plans.\\" The Washington Post. April 15, 1925. which necessitated additional expansion of the island. The Corps of Engineers had already planned to continue dredging the Potomac River and enlarge Columbia Island, so on April 1, 1925, Secretary of War John W. Weeks ordered the expenditure of $114,500 to dredge the river between the Highway Bridge and the Lincoln Memorial. The dredged material was dumped on Columbia Island.\\"Potomac Channel to Be Dredged for Flood Prevention.\\" The Washington Post. April 2, 1925. By June 30, 1927, dredging of the Potomac River and the reshaping of Columbia Island was largely finished.Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1927, p. 20. Boundary Channel marks the original Virginia shoreline.Moore, p. 91. It separates Columbia Island to the east from Virginia in the west and south, and is roughly a mile long. The channel is part of the Potomac River.\\"Oil Is Spilled Into Channel From Ft. Myer.\\" The Washington Post. June 14, 1977. In 1936, Boundary Channel was in width and in depth.Severin v. United States, 86 Ct. Cl. 53, 56 (1937). No lagoon existed at this time. Broundary Channel was changed again after ground was broken for The Pentagon on September 11, 1941. The Pentagon was being built on land just south of the Boundary Channel. But the ground to the northwest, north, northeast, and east of the building site was so low that, for a time, the Corps of Engineers considered building a levee to protect it from floods. But General Brehon B. Somervell, the Army officer in charge of the Pentagon's construction, decided instead to raise the ground by at least to or more above the average water level. Boundary Channel was dredged and slightly widened in order to help provide this fill material.Vogel, p. 133. Due to silting and other issues, Boundary Channel is approximately wide as of 2013 (although the width varies). It is also quite shallow.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

July 22, 1983. It was originally constructed as part of the channel, and was originally quite small as well as unnamed. During construction of the Pentagon in 1941, the U.S. Army not only needed a source of fill material to raise the land around the Pentagon, but also needed a way for river barges to deliver concrete, gravel, and sand to the construction site. With unused Columbia Island nearby, the Corps of Engineers quickly removed a portion of the island as well as dredged the bottom of the lagoon for this fill material. The Army also constructed a dike inland on the Virginia shoreline. The earth behind this dike was excavated to a depth below the Potomac River's average high tide. On what was to be the new shoreline, the Army and its contractors built cement plants and marshalling areas for the deposit of sand and gravel. The dike was then breached (and removed by dredge), allowing barges and other ships to deliver construction materials quickly and cheaply to the building site. More than of earth and riverbottom were excavated, and Boundary Channel's lagoon enlarged by . The Pentagon Lagoon was named by The Washington Post after a brutal murder there in September 1944. Virginia police found the nude body of 53-year-old Mrs. Margaret Fitzwater floating in the lagoon on the evening of September 24, 1944. Her throat had been slashed, and she had been raped. Within days, 60-year-old Gardner Tyler \\"Pop\\" Holmes, an eccentric who lived on a houseboat anchored in the lagoon, was charged with her murder. It quickly became apparent that Holmes was insane (and had, in fact, escaped from a Virginia mental hospital in 1931). A second throat-slashing murder and rape occurred on Hains Point (almost directly east of Boundary Channel on the D.C. side of the Potomac River) on October 5. This victim was 18-year-old Dorothy Berrum. Investigators quickly found eyewitnesses and a chain of evidence which led them to United States Marine Corps Private Earl McFarland. McFarland was indicted on December 11, 1944, and a jury convicted him of murder after an hour's deliberation on February 1, 1945.

An eight-day manhunt covered the entire East Coast before McFarland was recaptured in Knoxville, Tennessee, (his home town) on April 11. His escape led to scathing indictments about the way the D.C.

Recent research has shown that the modern game entered America in the 1850s through New Orleans when Scottish, Irish, German and Italian immigrants brought the game with them. It was in New Orleans that some of the first organized games that used modern English rules were held.  Men's soccer  Early versions of football were being played in the United States as early as 1685, and freshmen at Harvard University in 1734 were asked to provide \\"foot- balls\\". This did not resemble modern soccer in any way, except that it involved various kicking activities, and was often violent. By the 1860s, several different sets of rules began to be codified, such as the \\"Boston Game\\" which was like a hybrid of rugby and soccer. = Club soccer = *Timeline of a few of the known soccer leagues in the United States DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1920 till:2019 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:20 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 #> to display a count on left side of graph, use \\"left:20\\" to suppress the count, use \\"left:20\\"<# Colors = id:barcolor id:line value:pink id:bg value:white id:Full value:rgb(0.742,0.727,0.852) # Use this color to denote a team that is a current league member id:Former value:rgb(0.4,0.80,0.67) # Use this color to denote a team that is a former league member PlotData= width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Former from:1921 till:1934 text:American Soccer League (1921‚Äì1933) bar:2 color:Former from:1922 till:1937 text:International Soccer Football League (1922‚Äì1936) bar:3 color:Former from:1934 till:1984 text:American Soccer League (1933‚Äì1983) bar:4 color:Former from:1968 till:1986 text:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1985) bar:5 color:Former from:1978 till:1992 text:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978‚Äì1992) bar:6 color:Full from:1993 till:end text:Major League Soccer (1993‚Äìpresent) ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:5 start:1920 TextData = fontsize:L textcolor:black pos:(0,30) tabs:(400-center) text:  Oneida Football Club, and other organized teams  The Oneida Football Club was established in 1862 by Gerrit Smith \\"Gat\\" Miller, a graduate of the Latin School of Epes Sargent Dixwell, a private college preparatory school in Boston. At the time there were no formal rules for football games, with different schools and areas playing their own variations. This informal style of play was often chaotic and very violent, and Miller had been a star of the game while attending Dixwell. However, he grew tired of these disorganized games, and organized other recent preparatory school graduates to join what would be the first organized football team in the United States. The team consisted of a group of Boston secondary school students from relatively elite public (state) schools in the area, such as Boston Latin School and the English High School of Boston. Organization served the club well, and it reportedly never lost a game, or even allowed a single goal.  Football at universities  The 1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game is often cited to be the birth of intercollegiate American football, but it also considered the birth of soccer in the United States as well, as it was played with rules based on the Football Association's (FA) first set of rules. Although American football began to take hold at eastern universities such as Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, \\"socker\\" gained popularity at Haverford, Columbia, Cornell, and Penn. These enthusiasts arranged for English teams to tour the United States to generate interest in the sport in 1905, 1907, and 1909. Nevertheless, American football became the primary sport at most schools.  Immigrant communities  Soccer was popular among communities with large immigrant populations. Many towns in the West Hudson area of New Jersey, such as Kearny and Paterson, both of which had textile factories established and staffed by British companies. Residents of these areas founded the National Association Football League in 1895. Another notable location was centered around Fall River, Massachusetts, which also had textile companies and many immigrants from England. This area had the Bristol County League in 1886 and the Southern New England League in 1914. The third major location was St. Louis, Missouri, where the Catholic Church was primarily responsible for introducing soccer into its recreational programs. The St. Louis League was founded in 1886 and modified the FA's rules to its own liking, as did the St. Louis Soccer League, founded in 1903. Other communities where soccer had taken hold were Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.  Attempts at a governing body  The Fall River Rovers were among the few clubs to win both the National Challenge Cup and the American Cup. Before the creation of the United States Soccer Federation, soccer in the United States was organized on regional levels, with no governing body overlooking regional soccer leagues. The first non-league organizing body within the United States was the American Football Association (AFA) which was incarnated in 1884. The AFA sought to standardize rules for teams competing in northern New Jersey and southern New York. Within two years, this region began to widen to include teams in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and Texas. A professional league was established by owners of several Major League Baseball teams in 1894, called the American League of Professional Foot Ball (ALPFB), in an attempt to generate revenue during the winter months when their ballparks were empty. The AFA was displeased with the idea and banned any of its players that signed contracts with ALPFB teams. Despite the financial backing they had, the ALPFB failed to generate much interest and the league folded after only 17 days.  USFA vs. AFA, FIFA sanctioning  Within a year of its founding, the AFA organized the first non-league cup in U.S. soccer history, known as the American Cup. Clubs from New Jersey and Massachusetts dominated the first twelve years. However, beginning in 1894, due to economic conditions and labor unrest, teams in the Fall River area were forced to withdraw as many of them were sponsored the textile companies. Furthermore, players that had signed for the ALPFB teams were forbidden to play. As a result, the AFA suspended the cup in 1899, and it was not resumed until 1906 as a result of the interest generated by the English tour in 1905. In October 1911, a competing body, the American Amateur Football Association (AAFA) was created. The association quickly spread outside of the Northeast and created its own cup in 1912, the American Amateur Football Association Cup. In 1912, both the AFA and AAFA applied for membership in FIFA, the international governing body for soccer. Drawing on both its position as the oldest soccer organization and the status of the American Cup, the AFA argued that it should be the nationally recognized body. FIFA refused to recognize either of them, telling them there only needed to be a single group that could represent the United States. In 1913, the AAFA gained an edge over the AFA when several AFA organizations moved to the AAFA. On April 5, 1913, the AAFA reorganized as the United States Football Association. FIFA quickly granted a provisional membership and USFA began exerting its influence on the sport. This led to the establishment of the National Challenge Cup that fall. The National Challenge Cup quickly grew to overshadow the American Cup. However, both cups were played simultaneously for the next ten years. Declining respect for the AFA led to the withdrawal of several associations from its cup in 1917. Further competition came in 1924 when USFA created the National Amateur Cup. That spelled the death knell for the American Cup. It played its last season in 1924.  Soccer Wars  Brooklyn Celtic (1914). Towards the end of the 1920s, a period in American soccer known as the \\"American Soccer Wars\\" ignited. The Soccer Wars regarded the internal conflicts with the American Soccer League and their affiliated clubs participating in the National Challenge Cup. The debate involved whether the United States Football Association or the American Soccer League was the true chief organization of American soccer at the time, and consequently wrecked the reputation and possibly even the popularity of the sport domestically. The colloquial \\"war\\" has been considered responsible for the fall of the ASL, and the end to the first golden age of American soccer. The initial issue with the ASL had been the scheduling of the National Challenge Cup, which had been straining for the ASL season schedule. Typically, the National Challenge Cup had been played during the ASL's offseason, which made it difficult for ASL clubs to compete in the tournament. Consequently, the ASL boycotted the 1925 Challenge Cup due to scheduling conflicts, and the lack of cooperation the USFA inflicted on the ASL. American soccer historians claim that the real issue was the ASL vying to be the premier soccer body in the United States. Bethlehem Steel FC posing with their trophies won in 1915 In 1927, the issue intensified as ASL clubs were accused by FIFA for signing European players who were already under contract to European clubs. Due to the conflict and apparent corruption in the ASL, USFA president (at the time), Andrew M. Brown traveled to Helsinki, Finland for the 1927 FIFA Congress in the hopes of removing any penalties imposed on the ASL and USFA. Other issues regarding the soccer league involved the closed league model and the lack of American soccer players dominating the league. It resulted in ASL owners wanting to run their soccer clubs more like Major League Baseball teams, as many ASL owners owned MLB franchises. According to owners of ASL clubs, they saw these rulings as restrictions imposed on themselves, including the National Challenge Cup. With the hope of breaking away from the National Challenge Cup, Charles Stoneham, an owner of the New York Nationals proposed that the ASL would create their own tournament to determine the champion of the ASL, and thus ultimately determine the top American soccer club. This was the creation of early forms of playoffs culminating a regular season. Additionally, the proposal included expanding into the Midwest to include clubs from the Ohio River Valley and St. Louis regions, and create a new division for these clubs. Stoneham's plan involved having the two divisions compete in their own season, and the top clubs in each division playing in the ASL tournament to determine the ASL champion. Before the proposal, the National Challenge Cup was seen as the ultimate title in American soccer since most professional leagues in the United States focused on a specific region, rather than encompassing the entire country as a whole. The problem with this system was the fact that the American Soccer League was operating under a closed league model with a fixed number of franchises. This new tournament, or playoffs, would permanently cap the number of clubs entering this premier competition, unlike the National Challenge Cup, which the tournament was open to any USFA-affiliated team. Due to such reasons, three teams, Bethlehem Steel, the New York Giants S.C. and the Newark Skeeters, rejected the proposal, played in the 1928 National Challenge Cup and were subsequently suspended from the league and fined $1,000. Hence the ASL's decision, the USFA suspended the ASL which ignited the \\"Soccer Wars\\".September 25, 1928 The Globe In the 1928‚Äì29 American Soccer League, the Steel, Giants and Skeeters did not play in the ASL and joined local semi-professional leagues agglommerating to form the Eastern Professional Soccer League. Support for the USFA from other national federations, along with financial disadvantages the ASL faced as an unsanctioned league, eventually convinced the ASL that it could not win this \\"soccer war\\" and should yield. The \\"war\\" between the USFA and ASL was finally settled in early October 1929. During that time the ASL had already begun its 1929‚Äì30 season, halted during the settlement. Thanks to the settlement, the ASL was assembled back together, and played the remainder of the 1929‚Äì30 year until the moniker \\"Atlantic Coast League\\".November 4, 1929 The Globe  Decline of sport, amateur era  Stix, Baer and Fuller, who were dominant in the Challenge Cup in the 1930s Just two weeks following the United States Football Association and American Soccer League settlement, the stock market crashed. The abrupt and intense economic impact drastically affected the ASL in the league's Spring 1930 season, in which several clubs defaulted during the season, and clubs did not finish the season with the same number of matches played. Initially, the struggles in ASL did not affect the league's stronger clubs, as the Fall River Marksmen completed the double by winning both the 1930 season and the 1930 National Challenge Cup. As the Great Depression intensified, the original ASL folded following the Fall 1932 season, which was its 15th season in existence. At the apex of the Depression, several surviving clubs created an incarnation of the ASL which began play in 1933, but the stringent economy suffered the ability for ASL teams to field strong teams, and caused teams to not have the financial means nor interest to attract foreign players. This consequently caused a Dark Age of soccer in which the sport as well as the National Challenge Cup fell out of popularity and into obscurity. In spite of the decline in the sport's popularity, in several pockets of the country, primarily the Heartland and New England regions, as well as the New York City and St. Louis metropolitan areas, soccer continued to be extremely popular, especially with ethnic groups and expatriates. The popularity of soccer in these areas reflected on the Challenge Cup during the later Great Depression years, through the World War II years. Most clubs participating were either top amateur teams or semi- professional clubs that hoisted a handful of U.S. internationals, who worked part-time jobs.  Second professional age  = Rise of the original NASL = In 1967, two professional soccer leagues started in the United States: the FIFA-sanctioned United Soccer Association, which consisted of entire European and South American teams brought to the US and given local names, and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League. The National Professional Soccer League had a national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network, but the ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement was terminated. The leagues merged in 1968 to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). It has been suggested that the timing of the merger was related to the huge amount of attention given throughout the English-speaking world to the victory by England in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and the resulting documentary film, Goal.by who? The league lasted until the 1984 NASL season. = Pele and the New York Cosmos = Pel√© crying while teammate Carlos Alberto consoles him, at the end of his speech during Pel√©'s farewell match, October 1977 (New York Cosmos) The biggest club in the league and the organization's bellwether was the New York Cosmos, who drew upwards of 40,000 fans per game at their height while aging superstars Pel√© (Brazil) and Franz Beckenbauer (Germany) played for them. Although both were past their prime by the time they joined the NASL, the two were considered to have previously been the best attacking (offensive) (Pel√©) and defensive (Beckenbauer) players in the world. Giants Stadium sold out (73,000+) their 1978 championship win. = Decline and collapse of the NASL = Over-expansion was a huge factor in the death of the league. Once the league started growing, new franchises were awarded quickly, and it doubled in size in a few years, peaking at 24 teams. Many have suggested that cash-starved existing owners longed for their share of the expansion fee charged of new owners, even though Forbes Magazine reported this amount as being only $100,000. This resulted in the available personnel being spread too thinly, among other problems. Additionally, many of these new owners were not \\"soccer people\\", and once the perceived popularity started to decline, they got out as quickly as they got in. They also spent millions on aging stars to try to match the success of the Cosmos, and lost significant amounts of money in doing so. Also, FIFA's decision to award the hosting of the 1986 FIFA World Cup to Mexico after Colombia withdrew, rather than the U.S., is considered a factor in the NASL's demise. On March 28, 1985, the NASL suspended operations for the 1985 season, when only the Minnesota Strikers and Toronto Blizzard were interested in playing.  The 1980s and the 1994 FIFA World Cup   Modern professional age  = Men's national team = The first U.S. official formation in 1916, Stockholm Olympic Stadium, Sweden The US national squad at 1930 FIFA World Cup. 1930s In the 1930 World Cup, the U.S. finished third, beating Belgium 3‚Äì0 at Estadio Gran Parque Central in Montevideo, Uruguay. The match occurred simultaneously with another across town at Estadio Pocitos where France defeated Mexico. In the next match, the United States earned a 3‚Äì0 victory over Paraguay. For many years, FIFA credited Bert Patenaude with the first and third goals and his teammate Tom Florie with the second. Other sources described the second goal as having been scored by Patenaude or by Paraguayan Ramon Gonzales. In November 2006, FIFA announced that it had accepted evidence from \\"various historians and football fans\\" that Patenaude scored all three goals, and was thus the first person to score a hat trick in a World Cup finals tournament. Having reached the semifinals with the two wins, the American side lost 6‚Äì1 to Argentina. Using the overall tournament records, FIFA credited the U.S. with a third-place finish ahead of fellow semi-finalist Yugoslavia. The finish remains the team's best World Cup result and is the highest finish of any team from outside of CONMEBOL and UEFA, the South American and European confederations, respectively. Due to FIFA not wanting interference with the newly founded FIFA World Cup no official tournament was fielded in the 1932 Olympic Games . FIFA claimed the tournament would not be popular in the United States, so it would not be cost efficient to assist in the running of the tournament during struggling economic times. As a result, an informal tournament was organized including local rivals with the United States finishing first, followed by Mexico and Canada. The Olympic Tournament was reinstated in the 1936 Olympic Games. 1970s‚Äì1990s After the enthusiasm caused by the creation and rise of the North American Soccer League in the 1970s, it seemed as though the U.S. men's national team would soon become a powerful force in world soccer. Such hopes were not realized, however, and the United States was not considered a strong side in this era. From 1981 to 1983, only two international matches were played. To provide a more stable national team program and renew interest in the NASL, U.S. Soccer entered the national team into the league for the 1983 season as Team America. This team lacked the continuity and regularity of training that conventional clubs enjoy, and many players were unwilling to play for the team instead of their own clubs. Embarrassingly, Team America finished the season at the bottom of the league. Recognizing that it had not achieved its objectives, U.S Soccer canceled this experiment, and the national team was withdrawn from the NASL. U.S. Soccer made the decision to target the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California and the 1986 World Cup as means of rebuilding the national team and its fan base. The International Olympic Committee declared that teams from outside Europe and South America could field full senior teams, including professionals (until then, the amateur-only rule had heavily favored socialist countries from Eastern Europe whose players were professionals in all but name). The U.S. had a very strong showing at the tournament, beating Costa Rica, tying Egypt, losing only to favorite Italy and finishing 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 but didn't make the second round, losing to Egypt on a tiebreaker (both had three points). By the end of 1984, the NASL had folded and there was no senior outdoor soccer league operating in the United States. As a result, many top American players, such as John Kerr, Paul Caligiuri, Eric Eichmann, and Bruce Murray, moved overseas, primarily to Europe. The United States did bid to host the 1986 World Cup after Colombia withdrew due to economic concerns. However, Mexico beat out the U.S. and Canada to host the tournament, despite concerns that the tournament would have to be moved again because of a major earthquake that hit Mexico shortly before the tournament. In the last game of the qualifying tournament, the U.S. needed only a draw against Costa Rica, whom the U.S. had beaten 3‚Äì0 in the Olympics the year before, in order to reach the final qualification group against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played at El Camino College in Torrance, California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community, even providing Costa Rican folk dances as halftime entertainment. A 35th-minute goal by Evaristo Coronado won the match for Costa Rica and kept the United States from reaching its fourth World Cup finals. In 1988, U.S. Soccer attempted to re-implement its national-team-as-club concept, offering contracts to national team players in order to build an international team with something of a club ethos, while loaning them out to their club teams, saving U.S. Soccer the expense of their salaries. This brought many key veterans back to the team, while the success of the NASL a decade earlier had created an influx of talent from burgeoning grass-roots level clubs and youth programs. Thus U.S. Soccer sought to establish a more stable foundation for participation in the 1990 World Cup than had existed for previous tournaments. 2000‚Äìpresent Landon Donovan at the 2010 World Cup Clint Dempsey with the U.S. in 2011 After failing to maintain his 2002 success at the 2006 World Cup, Bruce Arena was eventually replaced by his assistant with the national team and Chivas USA manager, Bob Bradley, whose reign began with four wins and one draw in friendlies leading up to the 2007 Gold Cup, hosted by the United States. The U.S. won all three of its group stage matches, against Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and El Salvador. With a 2‚Äì1 win over Panama in the quarterfinals, the U.S. advanced to face Canada in the semifinals, winning 2‚Äì1. In the final, the United States came from behind to beat Mexico 2‚Äì1. The team's disappointing Copa Am√©rica 2007 campaign ended after three defeats in the group stage to Argentina, Paraguay, and Colombia. The decision by U.S. Soccer to field what many considered a second-tier team was questioned by fans and media alike. One of the hallmarks of Bradley's tenure as national team manager has been his willingness to cap a large number of players, many for their first time. This practice has been praised by those wanting to see a more diverse player pool for the national team, as well as criticized by those hoping for more consistency and leadership from core players. This has coincided with many young American players like Freddy Adu, Jozy Altidore, Clint Dempsey, Maurice Edu, Brad Guzan, Eddie Johnson, and Michael Parkhurst making their first moves from MLS to European clubs, meaning that more American players are gaining experience at the highest levels of club and international soccer than at any other time in the team's history. In Summer 2009, the United States had one of the busiest stretches in its history. For the 2009 Confederations Cup the U.S. was drawn into Group B with Brazil, Egypt, and Italy. After losing 3‚Äì1 to Italy and 3‚Äì0 to Brazil, the United States made an unlikely comeback to finish second in the group and reach the semi-final on the second tie-breaker, goals scored, having scored four goals to Italy's three. This was achieved on the final day of group play when the United States beat Egypt 3‚Äì0 while Brazil beat Italy 3‚Äì0. In the semifinals, the U.S. defeated Spain 2‚Äì0. At the time, Spain was atop the FIFA World Rankings and was on a record run of 15 straight wins and 35 games undefeated (a record shared with Brazil). With the win, the United States advanced to its first-ever final in a men's FIFA tournament; however, the team lost 3‚Äì2 to Brazil after leading 2‚Äì0 at half-time.United States 3‚Äì2 Brazil ‚Äì BBC Sport Only a few days after the Confederations Cup Final, the United States hosted the 2009 Gold Cup, and was drawn into Group B with Grenada, Haiti, and Honduras. Due to the fact that the U.S. had just played in the Confederations Cup and still had half of its World Cup qualifying campaign to go, Bob Bradley chose a side consisting of mostly reserves who had never really played together on the international stage and was criticized for selecting a \\"B Side\\" for the Continental tournament. The U.S. began group play with a pair of victories over Grenada and Honduras, and won the group with a draw against Haiti. In the quarterfinals, the United States defeated Panama 2‚Äì1 after extra time. In the semifinals the U.S. faced Honduras for the second time in the tournament, and the third time in less than two months. The United States beat Honduras 2‚Äì0 and advanced to its third consecutive Gold Cup final where the team faced Mexico in a rematch of the 2007 Gold Cup final. The United States was beaten by Mexico 5‚Äì0, surrendering its 58-match unbeaten streak against CONCACAF opponents on U.S. soil. It was also the first home loss to Mexico since 1999. The United States qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup atop their group, and they were drawn into Group C with England, Slovenia, and Algeria. Despite an early goal by Steven Gerrard, the USA drew 1‚Äì1 with England in their first match after a sloppy save by Rob Green off Clint Dempsey bounced off his hands and rolled into the goal. Against Slovenia, the United States found themselves down 2‚Äì0 quickly, and managed to tie the game at 2‚Äì2. They would have won, except a Michael Bradley goal was wrongly disallowed, and the game ended at the 2‚Äì2 scoreline. In their third and final group stage game against Algeria, Landon Donovan scored in the 91st minute to win the game 1‚Äì0 for the US, winning the group. They played Ghana next, where they lost in Extra Time 2‚Äì1 and bowed out of the tournament. The 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup was supposed to be a rebound for the United States, and for a time they looked to do very well. When they reached the Final, they found themselves against Mexico, where they went up 2‚Äì0 at halftime. However, they let the lead slip and lost 3‚Äì2. After this defeat, Bob Bradley was relieved of his position as manager. Not long after, J√ºrgen Klinsmann, former Bayern Munich and Germany manager, was hired. Under Klinsmann's leadership, the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying cycle went very well for the United States, as did the friendlies during that period. The United States defeated Mexico 1‚Äì0 in the Azteca Stadium for the first time in history in 2012. The United States also defeated Italy in Italy, at the time the number 3 team in the world, marking it the first time in history the USA defeated a Top 4 opponent on their soil. The second stage of CONCACAF World Cup Qualification ended with the USA topping its group of 4, Jamaica taking 2nd. In 2013, the United States had a record year. It started poorly, with a 2‚Äì1 loss to Honduras in San Pedro Sula, but the United States rebounded to defeat Costa Rica in Denver 1‚Äì0 in a match dubbed the \\"Show Clasico,\\" followed by the United States drawing Mexico in Azteca and earning the second qualification point in Mexico in history. The United States continued its strong run through June, defeating Germany 4‚Äì2 in the Centennial Match, and Jamaica, Panama, and Honduras to take a commanding lead of the Hex. The 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup took place at this point, and the United States fielded a younger team of players who were attempting to win their way into the senior squad, including Landon Donovan who was coming off of a sabbatical from the sport at the time. The United States won every game they played in the tournament, defeating Panama 1‚Äì0 in the Final to take the cup. The United States continued its win streak by defeating Bosnia- Herzegovina, but lost to Belgium to end their win streak at 13. The USA lost to Costa Rica, but defeated Mexico 2‚Äì0 in the Hex to seal a trip to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The United States then ended their year strong, defeating Jamaica and Panama to close out 2013, and Klinsmann was given a 4-year extension to his contract. 2014 brought Klinsmann's first World Cup with the United States, in which they were drawn in a \\"Group of Death\\" in Group G, alongside Germany, Portugal, and Ghana. Controversy marked the USA's entry, with the exclusion of Landon Donovan from the roster, with many believing Julian Green had been brought on at Donovan's expense. The USA entered the World Cup on a 3-game win streak from their send-off series. They defeated Ghana 2‚Äì1 off of a header from John Brooks in the 89th minute, and then played Portugal. The United States looked to have defeated Portugal and to have sealed a place in the knockout stages, but in stoppage time, Portugal scored a goal to end the game 2‚Äì2. The United States then played Germany and lost 1‚Äì0, but did escape group on goal difference. They were defeated by Belgium 2‚Äì1 in extra time after a heroic effort by Tim Howard, in which Howard set a World Cup record of 16 saves in a single match. The United States exited 2014 shakily, as opposed to their entry. In early September, Landon Donovan played his farewell match, and for a few months after, the USA failed to earn a win until a friendly against Panama. The United States finished in fifth place in the final round of the qualifying cycle for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which concluded in October 2017; due to this result, the team failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986.  Women's soccer  = Club Soccer =  Amateur Soccer: W-League and WPSL  Originally called the United States Interregional Women's League, the W-League was formed in 1995 as the first national women's soccer league, providing a professional outlet for many of the top female soccer players in the country. Starting as the Western Division of the W-League, the Women's Premier Soccer League broke away and formed its own league in 1997 and had its inaugural season in 1998. Both the W-League and the WPSL were considered the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States at the time, but eventually fell to a ‚Äúsecond-tier‚Äù level upon the formation of the Women's United Soccer Association in 2000.  Women's United Soccer Association (2000‚Äì2003)  As a result of the US Women's National Team's (USWNT) first-place showing in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, a seemingly viable market for the sport germinated. Feeding on the momentum of their victory, the twenty USWNT players, in partnership with John Hendricks of the Discovery Channel, sought out the investors, markets, and players necessary to form the eight-team league in February 2000, playing its first season in April 2001. It would be the world's first women's soccer league in which all the players were paid as professionals. The eight teams included the Atlanta Beat, Boston Breakers, Carolina Courage, New York Power, Philadelphia Charge, San Diego Spirit, San Jose CyberRays (called Bay Area CyberRays for 2001 season), and the Washington Freedom. The US Soccer Federation approved membership of the WUSA as a sanctioned Division 1 women's professional soccer league on August 18, 2000. The WUSA has previously announced plans to begin play in 2001 in eight cities across the country, including: Atlanta, the Bay Area, Boston, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Diego and Washington, D.C. Led by investor John Hendricks, the WUSA has also forged ahead on a cooperation agreement that will see the new league work side by side with Major League Soccer to help maximize the market presence and success of both Division I leagues. The WUSA played for three full seasons and suspended operations on September 15, 2003, shortly after the conclusion of the third season due to financial problems and lack of public interest in the sport.  Post-WUSA (2004‚Äì2009)  With the WUSA on hiatus, the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) and the W-League regained their status as the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States, and many former WUSA players joined those teams. The Washington Freedom was the only WUSA team to continue operations after the league dissolved (although new versions of the Atlanta Beat and Boston Breakers formed in 2009) and eventually became a part of the W-League in 2006. After the folding of WUSA, WUSA Reorganization Committee was formed in September 2003 that led to the founding of Women's Soccer Initiative, Inc. (WSII), whose stated goal was \\"promoting and supporting all aspects of women's soccer in the United States\\", including the founding of a new professional league. Initial plans were to play a scaled down version of WUSA in 2004. However, these plans fell through and instead, in June 2004, the WUSA held two \\"WUSA Festivals\\" in Los Angeles and Blaine, Minnesota, featuring matches between reconstituted WUSA teams in order to maintain the league in the public eye and sustain interest in women's professional soccer. A planned full relaunch in 2005 also fell through. In June 2006, WSII announced the relaunch of the league for the 2008 season. In December 2006, WSII announced that it reached an agreement with six owner- operators for teams based in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Washington, DC, and a then-unnamed city. In September 2007, the launch was pushed back from Spring of 2008 to 2009 to avoid clashing with 2007 Women's World Cup and the 2008 Olympic Games and to ensure that all of the teams were fully prepared for long-term operations.  Women's Professional Soccer (2009‚Äì2012)  The name for the new professional league, along with its logo, was announced on January 17, 2008. The league was to have its inaugural season in 2009, with seven teams, including the Washington Freedom, a former WUSA team. Twenty-one US national team players were allocated to each of the seven teams in September 2008. Also in September, the league held the 2008 WPS International Draft. Unlike WUSA, the WPS took \\"a local, grass roots approach\\", and \\"a slow and steady growth type of approach.‚Äù In addition, the WPS attempted to have a closer relationship with Major League Soccer in order to cut costs. The seven teams that played in the inaugural season of the WPS were the Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, FC Gold Pride, Los Angeles Sol, magicJack (originally Washington Freedom), Sky Blue FC, and Saint Louis Athletica. Most teams considered the first season a moderate success, despite many losing more money than planned. However, most teams began to see problems in 2010. Overall attendance for 2010 was noticeably down from 2009, teams were struggling with financial problems, and the WPS changed leadership by the end of the season. The success of the United States women's national soccer team at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup resulted in an upsurge in attendance league-wide as well as interest in new teams for the 2012 season. However, several internal organization struggles, including an ongoing legal battle with magicJack-owner Dan Borislow, and lack of resources invested in the league lead to the suspension of the 2012, announced in January 2012. On May 18, 2012 the WPS announced that the league had officially ceased operations, having played for only three seasons.  WPSL Elite (2012)  Up until 2012, the WPSL and W-League were the two semi-pro leagues in the United States and had sat under WUSA and the WPS. Upon the disbandment of the WPS, they once again regained their status as the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States. In response to the suspension, and eventual end, of the WPS, the Women's Premier Soccer League created the Women's Premier Soccer League Elite (WPSL Elite) to support the sport in the United States. For the 2012 season, the league featured former WPS teams, Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, and Western New York Flash, in addition to many WPSL teams. Six of the eight teams were considered fully professional. Many members of the USWNT remained unattached for the 2012 season while others chose to play in the W-League instead of the WPSL Elite.  National Women's Soccer League (2013‚Äìpresent)  After the WPS folded in 2012, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) announced a roundtable for discussion of the future of women's professional soccer in the United States, leading to the creation of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). The meeting resulted in the planning of a new league set to launch in 2013 with 12‚Äì16 teams, taking from the WPS, the W-League, and the WPSL. In November 2012, it was announced that there would be eight teams in a new women's professional soccer league. The league would be funded by the USSF, the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and the Mexican Football Federation (FMF). USSF would fund up to 24 players, the CSA up to 16, and the FMF a minimum of 12. Former WPS teams Western New York Flash, Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, and Sky Blue FC were joined by four other teams, for a total of eight teams for the inaugural season in 2012. Each club is allowed a minimum of 18 players on their roster, with a maximum of 20 players allowed at any time during the season. Each team's roster includes up the three allocated USWNT players, two Mexico women's national team players, and two CANWNT players via the NWSL Player Allocation. Each team also has, as of 2015, four spots for international players. The remaining roster spots must be filled by domestic players from the United States. In 2013, the Houston Dynamo of MLS stated interest in starting a women's team. By December 2013, the NWSL approved the new team, the Houston Dash, run by the Dynamo organization, for expansion in 2014. After the media boom of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, MLS side Orlando City SC showed interest in starting a women's team for the 2016 season. On October 20, 2015, it was announced Orlando City would launch its new NWSL team, the Orlando Pride, in the 2016 season. The NWSL in the first professional women's league to reach nine teams with the addition of the Houston Dash and is the first to last past its third season.  Folding of the W-League and Creation of United Women's Soccer  The W-League had served as a Division II development organization and league for women's soccer in the United States for 21 seasons. However, the W-League announced on November 6, 2015 that the league would cease operation ahead of the 2016 season. In response to the folding of the W-League and the problems occurring in the WPSL, the other Division II league in America, United Women's Soccer (UWS) was founded as a planned second-division pro-am women's soccer league in the United States. There are currently eight known teams, with plans to create the league with two conferences for the 2016 inaugural season. =Women's National Team= 1980s Mike Ryan was named the first national team coach after his success with the Tacoma Cozars, who won three straight national titles. A national women's soccer team was selected in 1982, 1983, and 1984, but they never played together. In 1985, about 70 women, mostly players from university teams, were invited to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to participate in the Olympic Sports Festival. At the end of the festival, Mike Ryan selected 17 players to play in a tournament in Italy. The players practiced for three days at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University. They were issued men's practice uniforms and sewed the \\"USA\\" decal on the front of their shirts the night before they flew to Italy. The national team's matches against Italy were brutal and many criticized Ryan on his coaching ability. After the Italy trip, he was unceremoniously removed as national team coach and replaced by Anson Dorrance, who had begun to build the most successful collegiate women's program in history at North Carolina. Dorrance built a national team with a core of young players and put the team in a 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 system, now legendary, but then scandalous. Dorrance had been told that if the team did not perform, he would be removed as head coach. This put a lot of pressure on the team to do well. The team played for no money, got around with third-class travel and cheap motels, and had little food. The attendance at their matches was low all throughout the 1980s.Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women's Football Team. By Ouisie Shapiro. HBO Sports, 2007. DVD. In 1988, FIFA hosted an invitational in China to test to see if a women's World Cup was feasible. The U.S. women's national team took part in the tournament and while they made it past the group stage, they were beaten by Norway in the quarter-finals. = 1991 Women's World Cup = The U.S. team took part in the first CONCACAF Women's Championship in 1991, which determined CONCACAF's single qualifier for the 1991 Women's World Cup. It took place between April 18 and 27, 1991 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The U.S. won all of its group matches in the tournament as well as all matches in the knockout stage, qualifying to the 1991 World Cup. In 1991, FIFA held the first FIFA Women's World Cup in China with 12 teams participating. The U.S. team consisted of now USWNT legends, including Joy Fawcett, Shannon Higgins, Kristine Lilly, Julie Foudy, Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm, April Heinrichs, Carla Overbeck and Carin Jennings. The United States won all six of its games and outscored its opponents 25‚Äì5. The team won its three group matches to finish first in the group, beat Taipei in the quarter-finals, and defeated Germany 5‚Äì2 in the semifinals. The United States beat Norway 2‚Äì1 in the final, and was the first U.S soccer team to win a World Cup. The team expected great fanfare upon returning to the United States, having just won the first Women's World Cup. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The win did not draw national attention and the team was without money. There was no training or games, and many players returned to college to await the fate of the team. It was nine months after the World Cup that the team played another match; however, they only played in two matches in 1992.  1993‚Äì1994  The team seemed to rebound in 1993, playing in significantly more matches than the previous year. Attendance had also increased from the previous year. The U.S. team took part in the 1993 CONCACAF Women's Championship in Long Island, New York, winning all of the matches they played. In 1994, the main task for the women's national team was to qualify for the 1995 Women's World Cup. In preparation for the qualifying tournament, the team competed in the inaugural edition of the Algarve Cup in Portugal. The U.S. finished in top position in its group; however, they lost to Norway in the final that was a replay of the 1991 Women's World Cup Final. The Algarve Cup was followed by wins over Trinidad & Tobago and Canada. The U.S. team then competed in the inaugural USA Women's Cup, pitting the U.S. against Germany, China, and Norway, their biggest rival at the time. They won all three matches, including a 4‚Äì1 win over Norway, to take the USA Women's Cup 1994. The 1994 CONCACAF Women's Championship in August determined the CONCACAF's two qualifiers for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. The team easily won the tournament to qualify for their second World Cup. 1995 The women's national team spent the first part of 1995 preparing for the World Cup. The team once again competed in the Algarve Cup in Portugal, during March. They started off the tournament well; however, a loss to Denmark put them in the third place match against Norway. The U.S. lost in penalty kicks. Next up was the Tournoi International Feminin in France in April. The team was back in shape, winning all of their matches, including a 3‚Äì0 win against host France. The team spent the two months leading up to the World Cup practicing, playing in six friendlies, all victories. They competed against Finland (2‚Äì0 and 6‚Äì0), Brazil (3‚Äì0 and 4‚Äì1), and Canada (9‚Äì1 and 2‚Äì1) just two weeks before the 1995 World Cup. In the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup in June, the United States won their group with 2 wins against Denmark and Australia and a draw against China. During their match against Denmark, goalkeeper Brianna Scurry received a red card for handling outside the penalty area and faced a two-game suspension. Since the US had already used their three substitutions, they had to finish the game with Mia Hamm in goal. In the quarterfinals, the U.S. faced Japan and won 4‚Äì0. Unfortunately, the quarter- final win led to a dreaded match against Norway. Michelle Akers, who was injured earlier in the tournament, returned at less than full strength. They lost the match 0‚Äì1 and had to settle for third place, beating China 2‚Äì0. The result was disappointing given that the U.S. had been the favorite to win. Shortly after their disappointing World Cup run, the U.S. competed in the 1995 USA Women's Cup in July and August in New Britain, CT. The U.S. team won all of the matches that they played in the tournament, including a 2‚Äì1 win over the 1995 World Cup Champion, Norway, to take the cup. 1996  The women's national team entered the Brazil Soccer Cup in January 1996 and won all four matches they played. The championship game was against Brazil and resulted in a draw, but the U.S. prevailed in penalty kicks. Following the Brazil Cup, the U.S. began their preparation for the Olympics, the first time women's soccer would ever be played at the event. They began their preparation with a series of friendlies, including two matches against Norway that resulted in one win and one loss. The U.S. team once again competed in the USA Women's Cup in May, winning all of the matches they played in the tournament. Leading up to the 1996 Olympics, a dispute between the players at the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) put their Olympic dreams in jeopardy. At this time, the members of the U.S. women's national team received $1,000 a month. However, they wanted to receive bonuses for any medal won, like the men's team; USSF was only offering a bonus if the team won gold. Several star players boycotted the training camp in January because of the dispute. It was eventually settled and the players returned in order to make the Olympic roster. At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, women's soccer was added for the first time. In the group stage of the tournament, the U.S. came away with two wins against Denmark and Sweden and a draw against China. In the semi-finals, the U.S. faced their long-time rival, Norway. While they fell behind in the first half, they were able to tie the game with a penalty shot late in the second half. During extra time, the U.S. scored, beating Norway to move on to the final. The U.S. team went against China in the Olympic final and won 2‚Äì1, taking away the gold medal. By the time the games were over, the top thirteen crowds in U.S. history for women's soccer had been set, including 76,489 for the final. However, the final match was not broadcast on national television. Following the 1996 Olympics, women's soccer began to attract serious attention around the nation. One player especially, Mia Hamm, became the face of women's soccer.  1997‚Äì1998  Mia Hamm during a match against Germany, 1997 The U.S. women's national team played 18 games in 1997, mostly international friendlies. The only major tournament was the 1997 USA Women's Cup held in May, which the U.S. once again won. The team ended the season with 16 wins and 2 losses. The team started off 1998 with the Guangzhou International Tournament in China with two wins against Sweden and Norway and a draw against China. They participated in the 1998 Algarve Cup in March and started off well with two wins in the group stage, but lost to Norway, leading to third place. A series of friendlies followed the Algarve until July, when women's soccer was added to the Goodwill Games for the first time. Only four teams competed and the U.S. took the gold, beating Denmark 5‚Äì0 and China 2‚Äì0. They ended off the year with the 1998 USA Women's Cup, winning every match they played. It was during that tournament that Mia Hamm scored her 100th goal.  1999: The Road to Pasadena  In preparation for the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, the U.S. women's national team played nineteen games, entitled \\"The Road to Pasadena,\\" leading up to the World Cup. The team started off the year with two friendlies against Portugal in January, winning both. In February, they got a wake up call when they lost an exhibition match against the FIFA World Stars. In March, they competed in the 1999 Algarve Cup, and lost in the final to China, 1‚Äì2. Following the devastating losses, the team spent the next three months with a series of friendlies in preparation for the World Cup. Their only loss was against China in late April. 1999 World Cup The Women's World Cup was held in the United States for the first time in 1999. Originally, FIFA had planned a small, low-key event, as the other two cups were. The USSF proposed that this World Cup was an opportunity to promote soccer in the United States and called for the use of larger stadiums across the nation. FIFA eventually allowed the competition to be staged at the level that the USSF wanted. The United States' roster for the World Cup was filled with veterans, six of the players having been in both the 1991 World Cup and the 1995 World Cup. Michelle Akers was on the original national team in 1985, Mia Hamm had just set the world scoring record, and Kristine Lilly was the world's leader in international appearances. In addition to the six players that appeared in the first two World Cups, six players would be playing their second World Cup, and eight players were appearing in a World Cup for the first time. Additionally, the team included thirteen of the sixteen members of the 1996 Olympic Team. During the group stage, the United States won all three of its matches, beating Denmark 3‚Äì0, Nigeria 7‚Äì1, and North Korea 3‚Äì0. Their opening game against Denmark brought a crowd of 78,972 fans, setting a world record for attendance at any women's sporting even, and an all-time Giants Stadium record for a sporting event of any kind. In the quarter-finals, the United States went against Germany in perhaps their toughest game of the tournament. They did pull through and beat Germany 3‚Äì2. In the semi-finals, the United States went against Brazil, winning easily 2‚Äì0 and advancing to the final against China. The final was held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and brought in over 90,000 fans. The game was scoreless after 90 minutes and two overtime periods, resulting in a penalty kick shootout. Briana Scurry, having proved herself throughout the entire tournament, saved the third shot by Liu Yang, putting the United States ahead. Brandi Chastain, a veteran on the team, scored the last shot, giving the U.S. the victory. Following the World Cup victory in July, the US took almost two months off to rest before playing a friendly against Ireland in September in Foxboro, MA. They then played Brazil in October, winning again. The United States also once again took part in the USA Women's Cup in 1999, winning all of the matches they played. Every game after the World Cup brought in large crowds, highlighted by 35,000 for the final two USA Women's Cup games. After their performance at the World Cup, the team made a 12-city Victory Tour playing exhibition indoor matches against a team of international stars. The tour lasted three months and featured cities that had not seen MLS or national team action.  2000 Strike and Summer Olympics  A ticker tape parade in Manhattan celebrating the USWNT's 2015 World Cup victory In December 1999, the team announced they would be sitting out the 2000 Australia Cup over a contract dispute with US Soccer. The federation was forced to send a team of younger players in place of the group that had competed at the World Cup the previous summer. Following the tournament, this younger group sided with the veterans and also refused to play until a more favorable contract was signed. The dispute was resolved in late January, and US Soccer was forced to increase the players' salaries, to a minimum of $5,000 a month. This raised the women's team salaries to be more on par with the men's team and reflected growth of the team. Following the dispute and the Australia Cup, the team had a year packed with major tournaments leading up to the Olympics. They won their first Algarve Cup in March, taking Portugal in an impressive 7‚Äì0 in the opening match of the tournament. The USA Women's Cup was played in May and the team had two shutouts to win the tournament. During the tournament, Kristine Lilly became the first player to earn a 200th cap in international play. The Pacific Cup took place in late May and although they suffered a loss in their first match against China, they recovered and won the tournament. In late June, the national team won the inaugural Women's Gold Cup, which served as the CONCACAF Women's Championship. In their last major tournament before the Olympics, the team headed to Germany for the DFB 100th Anniversary Tournament, which they easily won. Following a \\"Road to Sydney\\" friendly series, the team headed to Australia for the third time that year. Having won gold in 1996, the team automatically qualified for the Olympics. They were placed in a group with Norway, China, and Nigeria, guaranteeing a tough group stage. They made it through to the knockout stage and ended up in the final against Norway. At the end of the 90 minutes, the score was tied 2‚Äì2 after intense play. The final goal of the game was considered controversial. In overtime, United States defender Joy Fawcett attempted to clear an incoming ball. Instead, it hit Norwegian player Dagny Mellgren in the arm and she then kicked it into goal. The goal was allowed, and Norway won the game and the gold medal. The United States had to settle for silver. The women's national team saw a number of changes in 2000, with several veteran players retiring or injured, allowing the younger generation to step up.

It sells via a network of approximately 1200 self-employed advisors across Great Britain and Ireland. The company‚Äôs head office is in Nottingham, England, while manufacturing facilities are located in Nottingham and Washington, Tyne and Wear. Approximately 1500 people are employed by the company in roles including sales and marketing, ICT, customer services, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution. History =Early history= The company was established in 1971 by Tony Hillary. He originally made blinds in a converted garage at his home in Nottingham. As well as selling and fitting the blinds, Tony Hillary looked after advertising and manufacturing. Initially only two products Venetian blinds and vertical blinds were available. In 1974, roller blinds were introduced to the range. The company grew steadily over the following years and in 1978 production moved to a factory, where 100 people were employed. Four shops were opened in Nottingham, Leicester, Workington and Spennymoor. In 1982, a second factory opened in Washington, Tyne and Wear making blinds for customers in the north of England and Scotland. 1000 blinds per week were now being produced and sold. During the 1980s, Austrian and festoon blinds were added to the range of products. These were discontinued in the early 1990s. Curtains were also introduced ‚Äì they remained in the range for 20 years before being discontinued. In 1985, a new factory and head office opened in Nottingham. The following year, company sales reached ¬£10million a year. By 1990, 5000 blinds were being made each week. During the 1990s, more shops opened throughout the UK, bringing the total number of outlets to 18. The Hillarys product range increased again with the introduction of roman blinds and wooden blinds. Pleated blinds were also launched, reflecting the increased popularity of conservatories. Awnings for the outside of the home were added to the range in 1996. =Recent history= By 2000, 20,000 blinds were being produced each week. Tony Hillarys sold Hillarys to a management buyout team backed by Close Brothers Private Equity. Under the new management team, the marketing strategy changed. The company updated its logo and advertising tactics. The customer services team at head office was strengthened, as well as the structure of the sales team. In 2002, 1000 people were employed by the company and sales reached ¬£70 million. To mark the opening of a new manufacturing facility in Washington, Tyne and Wear in 2003, Hillary's manufactured the world‚Äôs largest vertical blind. It measured 20.1 meters wide and 8.3 meters tall, which is 75 times larger than the average blind manufactured by Hillary's. In 2004, Hillarys announced a second management buyout, backed by Change Capital Partners. In 2005, a programme to close the Hillarys shops took place. Woodweave blinds were introduced into the range. Interior shutters followed in 2006. A specialist products division was established in 2007 to concentrate on the company‚Äôs higher value products ‚Äì conservatory blinds, shutters and awnings. European Capital became financial backers of Hillarys in 2007. In the same year, sales reached ¬£100million. In 2008, a new production facility opened in the Bilborough area of Nottingham, on the Glaisdale Drive Industrial Estate. The reintroduction of curtains to the Hillarys product range began in Nottinghamshire in 2010, followed by counties in the south of England. Curtains are now available across Great Britain and Ireland. Recent News In 2011, Hillarys celebrated its 40th anniversary. The full product range now includes vertical blinds, venetian blinds, roller blinds, pleated blinds, roman blinds, wooden blinds, skylight blinds and Perfect Fit blinds. There are more than 850 blind fabric choices. Window shutters, awnings and curtains are available nationwide. Carpets are also available across most of Great Britain. In 2012, Hillarys opened its first concession in Highcross Leicester. This was followed by concessions and pop-up shops opening in major shopping centres across Great Britain and Ireland. Hillarys regularly appears at the Ideal Home Show. In 2013, Hillarys launched the Country Retreat range. This blinds and curtains collection was developed with Victoria Robinson, an upcoming fabric designer and then recent graduate from Nottingham Trent University. Hillarys was named Nottinghamshire Company of the Year in the Nottingham Post Business Awards in 2014. The judges praised Hillarys for its continued investment and growth, despite the difficult trading conditions following the financial crisis of 2007-08. Hillarys collaborated with House Beautiful, an interior decorating magazine, on a blinds and curtains range in 2015. Also in 2015, Hillarys sponsored the UNESCO International Year of Light, a year-long event that aimed to raise awareness of the achievements of light science and its applications. Meadoway, a Tony Hillary designed fabric that was originally released in 1974 and stayed in the range until 2010, was revamped and re-released in 2015. 1300 employees work at the company‚Äôs three sites at Colwick and Bilborough (Glaisdale) in Nottingham, and Washington, Tyne and Wear. 1100 self-employed advisors sell products throughout the UK.

Career =Torquay United= Born in Kingsbridge, Yeoman signed for Torquay United on 1 August 2008 and made his debut on 9 October 2008 when he came on as a 70th-minute substitute against Oxford United. He spent time on loan at Southern Football League Premier Division team Tiverton Town and signed a professional contract in May 2010.Torquay United youngsters sign professional deals, BBC sport, 2010-05-25. Retrieved 2011-06-10. Yeoman returned to his parent club in early 2011 and he was subsequently named as a substitute on two occasions, firstly on 1 February, a game Torquay lost 3‚Äì1 to Hereford United, then exactly a month later in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Rotherham United. Previously, Yeoman enjoyed a prolific loan spell at Bideford in 2010.1\\\\. Torquay United's Ashley Yeoman in loan move to Bideford Yeoman made his Football League debut as a substitute against Bradford City on 18 February 2012 but could not prevent Torquay losing 2‚Äì1. That would be his only appearance of the 2011‚Äì12 season. The following season, he made another substitute appearance against Leicester City in the League Cup. Yeoman scored his first goal for the club in his third league appearance, once again as a substitute, with a header in the 84th minute of Torquay's 4‚Äì3 comeback victory over Aldershot Town. Yeoman made his FA Cup debut on 3 November 2012, coming on as a substitute in Torquay's 1‚Äì0 defeat to Harrogate Town. He also appeared in the Boxing Day Devon Derby against Plymouth Argyle. On New Years Day 2013, Yeoman was handed his first professional start by manager Martin Ling against AFC Wimbledon. Despite a strong performance he had to settle for a further substitute appearance in the following match at Burton Albion. There would be several more appearances throughout the season, most memorably at Morecambe where he scored the goal that is largely considered to be the goal that avoided relegation. Yeoman would also collect the 'Goal of 2013' award by the Plainmoor faithful for his effort. The town of Salcombe will consider renaming its local football pitch to Yeoman Park in honour of the striker, with towns folk set to vote on the proposal in April 2014. On 24 May 2013, Ashley signed a new contract for the 2013‚Äì14 season under new permanent manager Alan Knill. On 2 October 2013, Yeoman returned to former club Bideford on a three-month loan deal. He scored a hat trick soon after arriving. After the sacking of Knill, Torquay's latest manager Chris Hargreaves recalled Yeoman as he looked to add fire power ahead of another relegation battle. On 14 February 2014, Yeoman joined Conference South side Dorchester Town on a one-month loan. After scoring just 1 goal, Yeoman was recalled for the second time in a season. He made his first league appearance of Torquay's 2013/14 season against Bury, where he scored a crucial 90th-minute winner. He added a second goal to his season's tally against local rivals Exeter City and a third goal the following match at Mansfield Town. Despite these goals Torquay United succumbed to relegation. On 14 May 2014, Yeoman signed a new one-year deal with the Gulls. He went on to make 29 league appearances during the season, largely from the bench, as United finished in a mid-table position in the National League. He managed 2 league goals against Dover Athletic and a late winner versus Lincoln City,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32020961 while also netting a sensational goal in the FA Trophy at home to Bromley. Sky Sports presenter Helen Chamberlain selected it as her Torquay goal of the season ahead of strikes by Luke Young and Ryan Bowman. Following the departure of Chris Hargreaves, Yeoman would earn another contract and work with his sixth different manager at the Launa Windows Stadium. Paul Cox had been impressed by a 9-goal spell in only 2 games as an off contract trialist offering him a six- month contract until January, however on 10 December 2015 Ash was released by Torquay United as player-manager Kevin Nicholson said \\"Ash has been unable to establish a first team regular place, and I feel it will be beneficial for him to go away to play some regular football and score some goals at whatever level that will be\\" It is very disappointing for Ash as this is the club he came through the youth ranks at 16, Yeoman scored 7 goals in 59 games, and 46 of them as a substitute.

Wright's license was not renewed in 2001 during the appeal of an Illinois lawsuit ruling that she and her husband, as professionals regulated by the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation (IDPR), used their position to promote private business ventures unregulated by the IDPR to clients in 2000. In a decision by the Illinois First District Appellate Court, the Wrights argued that the suit should be overturned on the basis that their professional licenses had been allowed to lapse, leaving them outside IDPR jurisdiction, to which the appellate court concurred, reversing the decision in 2002.

In contrast to older cumbias the lyrics of New Chilean Cumbia deals more with urban life and combines aspects of rock, hip hop and a wide variety of Latin American genres like Andean music, salsa, the son, reggae, boleros, ska, Latin-African music, diablada and even folklore from the Balkans, like the Klezmer, and Gipsy music.

Like all Magicicada species, M. neotredecim has reddish eyes and wing veins and a black dorsal thorax. It has a 13-year life cycle but seems to be most closely related to the 17-year species Magicicada septendecim. Both species are distinguished by broad orange stripes on the abdomen and a unique high-pitched song said to resemble someone calling \\"weeeee-whoa\\" or \\"Pharaoh.\\" They differ only in life cycle length. Another closely related 13-year species Magicicada tredecim differs very slightly from M. neotredecim, and for many years two were considered one species with slight differences in abdomen color and mitochondrial DNA suggesting a zone of hybridization or introgression between 13-year and 17-year -decim populations. Then in 1998, scientists studying recordings of the chorus sound of Brood XIX recognized that the low- pitch component of the chorus contained two peak frequencies in some midwestern populations, corresponding to the songs of two sympatric 13-yr species related to M. septendecim. Experiments subsequently demonstrated the existence of two populations of female cicadas that responded selectively based on the two male song frequencies. Because of their many similarities, M. neotredecim, M. tredecim, and M. septendecim are often described together as \\"decim periodical cicadas.\\" Broods and distribution Periodical cicadas are assigned to broods based on their year of emergence and life-cycle length. The other three 13-year species (M. tredecim, M. tredecassini, and M. tredecula) are represented in all three of the extant 13-year broods: Brood XIX (emerging in 2011), Brood XXII (emerging in 2014), and Brood XXIII (emerging in 2015). M. neotredecim was first discovered in 1998 in Brood XIX, where it occurs toward the northern part of the range, showing a narrow range of overlap with the more southern species M. tredecim. It has also been observed in Brood XXIII but not in Brood XXII. Distribution of the species of the genus Magicicada in the U.S.: green = 17-year cicadas; other colors = 13-year cicadas; blue = M. neotredecim, yellow = overlap of M. neotredecim with M. tredecim Life Cycle Their median life cycle from egg to natural adult death is around thirteen years. However, their life cycle can range from nine years to seventeen years. Discovery in 1998 Magicicada males typically form large aggregations that sing in chorus to attract receptive females. M. neotredecim was first identified when scientists noticed a bimodal split in the dominant pitch (frequency) of male calling songs during the 1998 emergence of Brood XIX. The dominant song pitch of M. neotredecim ranges from 1.25 kHz to 1.90 kHz. (This is similar to the pitch-range of M. septendecim except that songs of the 17-year species do not extend so far into high frequencies.) M. neotredecim song frequencies have been observed to displace upward in areas where their range overlaps with the similar M. tredecim, whose dominant song pitch is lower, ranging between 1.00 kHz and 1.25 kHz. These distinctive calling songs prompted a closer look at older data concerning M. tredecim. Two different forms of mitochondrial DNA, correlated with a difference in abdominal color, had already been seen in insects assigned to this species. David Marshall and John Cooley determined that these known differences correlated with the observed pitch difference in males and a corresponding pitch preference in females. The name M. neotredecim was given to the variant whose song and abdominal coloring (orange with a black lateral band or center) resemble the 17-year species M. septendecim. The earlier name M. tredecim was reserved for the group whose abdomen is mostly orange and whose song has a lower pitch. The discovery of Magicicada neotredecim showed that four reproductively isolated 13-year periodical cicada species emerge together in a narrow region from southern Indiana to northwest Arkansas (encompassing sections of Broods XIX and XXIII). Elsewhere, only as many as three species can be found together.

James Alfred (Jim) Carrington was born in Norwich, Norfolk, England on 8 February 1977 and lives with his young family in south west London. Education and career Educated in state schools in Norfolk, Carrington went on to read English at Queen Mary, University of London, and trained to teach at South Bank University. He then gained an MA in Writing for Young People at Bath Spa University, where his work attracted the attention of Bloomsbury Publishing. He also teaches part-time in a state primary school in London. In 2011 Carrington appeared at Hayfever, the children's section of the Hay Festival. Writing Carrington's novels fall within the genre of young adult fiction, early readers and chapter books. His first three novels, Inside My Head (2010), In the Bag (2011) and Drive By (2012), feature young protagonists whose lives reflect experiences with which teenagers and young adults in a twenty-first-century United Kingdom will be very familiar: bullying, anti- social behaviour, mental health issues, identity and relationships. Carrington's fourth YA novel, Boy 23 (2015), took a different course, creating a wider dystopian socio-political world through which he examines the violent society in which a virulent epidemic of unknown origin emerges. This is seen from the perspective of two teenagers whose earlier lives have been radically different from each other. A science-fiction comic novel for 7-11 year old readers is forthcoming. He has also published shorter works, including an ongoing collection retelling traditional Malay and Javanese folktales for younger readers, featuring the clever mouse-deer folk character Sang Kancil. These form part of Cambridge Reading Adventures, a series of International Readers which constitute a primary-phase guided reading scheme created by the UCL Institute of Education International Literacy Centre in collaboration with Cambridge University Press.http://www.cambridge.org/gb/education/subject/english/literacy/cambridge- reading- adventures?currentTheme=Education&layout;=listing&query;=&tab;=education&pageSize;=20&sorting;=eanTitle%5Basc%5D&page;=5 In 2016 Carrington was commissioned to create a series for LDA (Learning Disabilities Association), a provider of teaching supplies which support children with special educational needs (SEN).

The colours and details of the painted decoration vary between examples, as is typical of S√®vres porcelain, and one example is on a later gilt wood stand. The openwork lid lifts off to allow refilling of the pot-pourri. The shape was eventually produced in two or three versions, at slightly different sizes. It was first designed in 1757, probably by Jean-Claude Duplessis (c. 1695‚Äì1774), the artistic director of the factory. The first surviving finished example dates to 1759.Louvre; Metropolitan; Royal Collection; Frick; two sizes per Sassoon, 49, others say three Another name for them is vaisseau √† mat (masted ship). These vases are considered to be one of the most famous models introduced by the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres; patrons such as Madame de Pompadour and her brother the Marquis de Marigny collected the form. Among the largest vessels produced by the factory, these vases were extremely difficult to fire; the multiple openwork piercings in the body weakened the overall structure, and they tended to collapse in the kiln. Consequently, only about twelve were ever produced, ten of which survive today.Louvre; Metropolitan; Royal Collection The shape derives from the nef, a table decoration in the form of a ship, usually of precious metals, used since medieval times. The arms of the City of Paris also showed a ship, and the vases may reflect this. The vase would have held potpourri used to perfume a room. Eighteenth-century ladies made their own, experimenting with various ingredients and sometimes blending essences for as long as nine years. The vases were made to be sold with other vases of different shapes to form a garniture to place on a mantelpiece or side table. The main background colours in different examples range from pink to green and dark blue, and the subjects of the main painted spaces from naval subjects after Dutch painting to chinoiserie genre scenes. The paintings on the rear are mostly flowers, or other inanimate objects, such as the garnish of marine still-life on the Walters' example. Versions and copies S√®vres still have some of the moulds, and a plaster model which incorporates features from both sizes. At S√®vres the shape evolved from a vase with no lid, the cuvette √† masques, produced from 1754 (earliest example, at Houghton Hall), and the shape of the pot pourri √† vaisseau was also used in an adaptation as a lidded tureen with a stand, the terrine gondole from at least 1757 (two in the Hofburg Palace in Vienna), and a different pot pourri gondole.Sassoon, 49 The popularity of S√®vres porcelain with English collectors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is demonstrated by the presence of all ten known examples of this shape of vase in English collections by the mid-nineteenth century. Today there is one in France, five in the UK and four in the US. The shape was copied, usually in somewhat simplified form, by some other manufacturers, notably the English firm Mintons, who were commissioned to make a replica by Georgina Ward, Countess of Dudley, when her husband sold his original in the 1880s; this is the example now in the Getty Museum.Sassoon, 52, though Sotheby's gave a somewhat different history when they sold the Minton Museum's example in 2005, File:S√®vres Porcelain Manufactory - Potpourri Vase (Vase potpourri √† vaisseau) - Walters 48559 - Back (cropped).jpgBack of the Walters Art Gallery vase.

Waddesdon Manor was built in the 1880s by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, a keen collector of French decorative arts. The bleu c√©leste vase was Baron Ferdinand's first important purchase as a collector in 1861. He acquired it from the dealer Alexander Barker and it was said that the vase had been a gift to an ancestor of the Prince of Salerno by Louis XV.Svend Eriksen, The James A. de Rothschild Collection at Waddesdon Manor: S√®vres Porcelain (Office du Livre, 1968), p. 138. The front panel shows a battle scene, while the back is decorated with flowers, possibly by Jean- Louis Morin. The battle scene shows two armies, one side in white coats and the other in blue. It probably refers to the last three years of the Seven Years' War that saw France allied with Austria and Spain against Britain and Prussia.Eriksen, S√®vres Porcelain, p. 138. Waddesdon's second ship vase has a dark blue ground colour with caillout√© decoration, trellis-work and scrolls in gold. The two panels were probably painted by Andr√©-Vincent Vielliard. The front panel shows peasants seated around a table outside a tavern. This scene was adapted from a detail of the painting F√™te de Village by David Teniers the Younger. Baron Ferdinand purchased this vase from the collection of the 5th Earl Spencer.Eriksen, S√®vres Porcelain, p. 142. The ground colour of the third ship vase is a rare 'petit vert' which was only produced for a short time around 1760. It is believed to have been purchased from a 'Mrs Yorke of Torquay'.Eriksen, S√®vres Porcelain, p. 140. The dock-side scene was possibly painted by Jean-Louis Morin, while the back panel is decorated with flowers. The architectural base of this vase is unique and differs from all other known ship vases. The vase was probably designed to be mounted on its existing ormolu plinth in which an ormolu dolphin is interposed between each pair of triglyphs.Eriksen, S√®vres Porcelain, p. 140. All three vases were produced around 1761 and are now owned by the National Trust.Waddesdon Manor = Louvre, Paris = Jean-Claude Duplessis (c. 1695‚Äì1774), painted by Charles- Nicolas Dodin (1734‚Äì1803), c. 1760 in pink and green, with a chinoiserie scene in the main panel, after a painting by Fran√ßois Boucher.

The front reserve depicts a genre scene taken from an unknown source, inspired by David Teniers the Younger (1610‚Äì90). The ends of the vase are in the form of a bowsprit, projecting from the jaws of a marine head, and at the masthead is a fluttering white pennant, patterned with fleurs-de-lis. The vase was purchased in 1759 at the end-of-year sale at Versailles by Madame de Pompadour for 960 livres. Madame de Pompadour is known to have owned at least three examples of this model (including those now in the Louvre and Royal Collection); these formed important components of her sumptuously appointed apartments.Royal Collection; Metropolitan; Waddesdon Manor = Wallace Collection, London = Acquired by Richard Seymour-Conway, the 4th Marquess of Hertford, by 1865, and possibly from the collection of Marie-Gabriel-Florens-Auguste, comte de Choiseul, known as Choiseul-Gouffier, this is the third of the ship-shaped vases designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis p√®re (active 1748‚Äì74) in the 1750s.

Designed by famed Portland architect A. E. Doyle in a Roman classical style, the four-story building's first section, facing Sixth Avenue, was completed and opened in 1917. An extension westward to Broadway, approximately doubling its size, was constructed in 1925. Since then the building has occupied one-half of a city block. It features a four-story-high colonnade of Corinthian order columns at its eastern end, originally the principal fa√ßade, and extensive use of glazed terracotta. The interior is also decorated extensively with highly textured materials. The building was constructed for the United States National Bank of Portland (USNB), which ultimately became part of U.S. Bancorp, whose retail banking division operates as U.S. Bank. In 2020, more than 100 years after the building's opening, it continues to serve as the bank's main Portland branch. History The United States National Bank of Portland, the predecessor of present-day U.S. Bancorp, was established in Portland in 1890, opening for business in February 1891. During the following three decades, the bank experienced significant growth. It weathered the Panic of 1893 better than many of its competitors, and later acquired some of the competing Portland banks, including the Ainsworth National Bank (in 1902), the Wells Fargo Bank (in 1905), and the Lumbermen's National Bank (in 1917). With the 1902 acquisition, U.S. National Bank moved its headquarters into a larger space formerly occupied by Ainsworth National, in the Ainsworth Building, then located at S.W. Third and Stark streets in downtown Portland. By the 1910s, the bank had outgrown its space. The firm purchased a quarter-block of land at the northwest corner of Sixth and Stark streets in early 1916 and hired Portland architect A. E. Doyle to design a new, dedicated headquarters building. Construction began in 1916 and was completed in 1917; the building opened to the public on July 30, 1917.\\"Bank's home opens; United States National officers hold reception\\". (July 31, 1917). The Morning Oregonian, p. 9. Although the building now extends a full block along Stark Street, with entrances on both 6th Avenue and Broadway, it originally faced only 6th Street (now 6th Avenue) and extended only about halfway to Broadway. In 1922 (another source says 1920),\\"Lodge's Birthday to be Celebrated; Elks of Portland to Entertain Thursday\\". (October 30, 1927).

Originally, a new 24-story building was planned for the site,\\"New Downtown Buildings To Aggregate $3,500,000\\". (June 10, 1923). The Sunday Oregonian, Section 4, p. 8. but the bank ultimately decided to expand its existing building, keeping the same design and height for the new section.\\"Bank Awards Contract; Dougman & Christmas to Erect U. S. National's Addition\\". (March 22, 1924). The Morning Oregonian, p. 9. Shortly after demolition of the old Elks Building in early 1924, construction of the bank building's expansion began. The new section opened in 1925, doubling the building's size and adding an entrance on Broadway. Doyle was hired again to oversee the expansion, which helped to ensure that the new section would replicate the style of the original section as much as possible, making the expanded building look as though it were built as a single structure, rather than in two stages separated by eight years. In the same year, U.S. National Bank of Portland acquired the Ladd & Tilton Bank,\\"U.S. Bank Buys Ladd & Tilton; Transfer of Assets Is Begun Immediately\\". (July 12, 1925). The Sunday Oregonian, p. 1. which had been established in 1859, and was the first financial institution in the Pacific Northwest.\\"Ladd, Tilton Bank Organized in 1859; History of Institution Bound Up in Portland's\\". (July 12, 1925). The Sunday Oregonian, p. 12. This acquisition made USNB \\"the largest financial institution north of San Francisco and west of Minneapolis\\". In 1946, U.S. National purchased the Wells Fargo Building (since 1922 known as the Porter Building),\\"$875,000 Annex for U. S. National; Porter Building Pioneers City's Steel Construction\\". (September 26, 1946). The Oregonian, p. 18. a multistory office building located directly adjacent, immediately to the north, to expand its downtown Portland headquarters. United States National Bank of Portland changed its name to United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964. By 1970, the bank was operating 119 branches. At that time, it announced plans for another major expansion of its headquarters on property it had acquired diagonally across from the Wells Fargo Building. The entire oversize block, bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues, and Oak and Burnside Streets, had been acquired, its existing buildings to be razed and replaced by new U.S. National Bank buildings. The first of these was a seven-story building (the U.S. Bank Plaza, at 5th & Oak), completed in 1974.\\"New office buildings take place on downtown skyline, boost economy\\". (March 24, 1975). The Oregonian, p. G2. But the headline structure was the U.S. Bancorp Tower, a 42-story building that opened in 1983 (having already been part of the bank's long-term site plans in 1970, but ultimately delayed until the 1980s). Notwithstanding this major expansion, the firm continued to own and use its landmark 1917 building, which company president LeRoy Staver, in a 1970 Oregonian article, called \\"a jewel of a banking property and one that will never be duplicated\\". Unlike the original fa√ßade, the western fa√ßade includes the bank's name inscribed on the frieze. In a 1979 article, The Oregonian wrote that, \\"The 1917-vintage U.S. National Bank, 321 S.W. Sixth Avenue, retains nearly all its original features, inside and out, a rare trait among Portland landmarks.\\" The U.S. National Bank of Oregon was honored by the Portland Historical Landmarks Commission in that year for its longstanding commitment to maintaining the building in nearly original condition. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, and was still serving as the bank's main branch. Since the end of 1968, United States National Bank of Oregon has been owned by the then-newly formed holding company U.S. Bancorp, which provides consumer banking under the U.S. Bank name. One hundred years after its opening, the 1917-built, 1925-expanded original United States National Bank Building continues to serve as the main branch of U.S. Bank in Portland in 2017. Description =Exterior= The central entrance of the eastern fa√ßade with doors featuring bronze bas reliefs cast in 1931 The building is five stories tall including a mezzanine level and, after its 1925 expansion, occupies a area, along the north side of SW Stark Street from Sixth Avenue to Broadway. The eastern fa√ßade, facing Sixth Avenue, features six freestanding Corinthian columns, each in height. These support a portico that is topped by a large and richly decorated Roman frieze, a cornice and balustrade. Decorations on the cornice include lion heads and palmettes. At the back of the portico, and behind the columns, are two Corinthian pilasters, at the far left and right ends of the fa√ßade. Between these are \\"five vertical bays separated by piers made of coursed, rusticated terra cotta. Window openings are set in cast-bronze frames.\\" The five windows at the second-floor level are topped by cast-bronze segmental pediments. There are three entrance doorways in the three central bays, although originally there was only one. The central entrance features a pair of large bronze doors with highly decorated bas relief panels, surrounded by detailed terracotta, including replicas of early Greek, Roman and U.S. coins\\"United States National Bank Now Located in Its New Home\\". (July 29, 1917). The Sunday Oregonian, Section 1, p. 15. in the decoration framing the door, and a heraldic eagle in a pedimented cornice above the doorway. The bronze relief panels were cast in 1931, replacing the 1917 door panels. Designed by Avard Fairbanks, they \\"depict noble concepts of American life, such as 'Knowledge and Service', 'Domestic Welfare', 'Progress through Direction', and so on.\\" Fairbanks also designed bronze relief panels for the building's western fa√ßade, built in 1925. Bronze lamp on the western fa√ßade The overall exterior design was modeled closely on a 1904 bank building, the headquarters of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, in New York City. The southern fa√ßade, along Stark Street, is long and features a line of 14 Corinthian pilasters. The 12 window bays on this side have frames made of cast iron. Above the pilasters and fourth-floor windows are a cornice and balustrade with a design similar to that used at the eastern end. The Stark Street side includes one entrance, which was present from 1917, located at what was then the far back corner of the building, but its position became approximately midway along the Stark Street side following the 1925 expansion. At the building's west end, constructed eight years later and facing Broadway, the fa√ßade is similar to the eastern one, but the main body of the building extends to the corners of the lot, and instead of a full-width portico there is a recessed portico with only two columns in the center. Six pilasters line the eastern fa√ßade, three to each side of the columns, all topped by Corinthian capitals, the same as on the building's other two exposed sides. Another difference from the eastern fa√ßade is that, on the western fa√ßade, \\"United States National Bank\\" is inscribed in the central section of the frieze, in place of the rinceau decoration there at the building's opposite end. Ornamental bronze lanterns flank the central entrance, which features bas relief panels cast in bronze in 1926‚Äì27 and designed by Avard Fairbanks. The panels at the western entrance \\"depict pivotal events in the historical development of the Columbia Basin\\". =Interior= The ground floor holds the main banking room (the Portland branch of U.S. Bank), and a grand room measuring with ceilings. The interior is extensively decorated with highly textured materials. Square columns of polished marble topped by Corinthian capitals that incorporate an eagle motif line all four sides of the main public space. The coffered ceiling is intricately detailed. The marble floor is patterned, and the teller windows are divided by Hauteville-marble pillars detailed with bas reliefs. A recessed mezzanine floor runs along the north and south sides, behind the columns. The bank vaults are in the basement, where the public space also has a marble floor. The third and fourth floors are office space, centered around a courtyard. A remodeling of the fourth-floor offices in 1948, based on designs by Pietro Belluschi, incorporated Oregon myrtle in the paneling and custom furnishings. The bank's board room, located on the third floor, includes a marble fireplace and stained glass windows by the noted Portland company, Povey Brothers Studio. The room is located in the southwest quadrant of the floor, in the 1925-built section, and is in size. Its walls are covered in dark walnut. Ornamental lighting fixtures with brass wall mountings adorn the east and west ends of the room, and a bronze ring chandelier hangs above the center. =Gallery= File:U.S. National Bank Building, Portland - main banking room (2011).jpgThe main banking room, viewed from the west end (1925 section) towards the east end (1917 section) File:U.S. National Bank Building, Portland - portion of ceiling and interior columns (2011).jpgElaborately detailed ceiling panels and eagle-motif capitals in the ground-floor main banking room File:U.S. National Bank Building board room - southeast corner.jpgCorner of the board room, with fireplace and one of three large stained glass windows File:United States National Bank Building, Portland, Oregon (2012) - 19.JPGMarble stairway with bronze ornamentation Immediate surroundings At its east end, the United States National Bank Building stands directly across 6th Avenue from another A. E. Doyle-designed bank building, the Bank of California Building, of 1925. The aforementioned building's Italianate style contrasts sharply with the U.S. National Bank Building's classical design. The northbound Portland Transit Mall passes in front of the building's east end, and during the mall's construction in 1976‚Äì77 the plain concrete sidewalk there was resurfaced in brick, and street trees were added. MAX light rail trains have passed in front of the building's east end on 6th Avenue since 2009, following a 2007‚Äì08 rebuilding of the transit mall.

Zugf√ºhrer is a military appointment to a sub-subunit leader, e.g. platoon leader, belonging to the Non-commissioned officer (NCO) rank group or junior officer. A Zugf√ºhrer leads or commands normally a subunit that is called in German language Zug (en: platoon, platoon-size unit, or detachment).  Germany  Zugf√ºhrer (ZgFhr) of the Bundeswehr is an appointment. The Zugf√ºhrer is a subunit leader and commands a Zug (in the following platoon) that ‚Äì depending on the service, branch, or branch of service ‚Äì normally contains 30 to 60 service members or soldiers. The Bundeswehr platoon consists of some groups; some platoons build a company (infantry), battery (artillery), or squadron (Air Force). To the appointment of Zugf√ºhrer might be assigned normally an officer (2nd lieutenant of 1st lieutenant to the I. and II. platoon of a company), or an experienced port epee-NCO with the rank Hauptfeldwebel or Stabsfeldwebel (III. and IV. platoon of a company).

At German military academies the designation of the appropriate appointment is H√∂rsaalleiter (lecture hall leader), and will be by filled with an officer. = Nazi Germany = The title of Zugf√ºhrer was also a paramilitary title of Nazi Germany which is most often associated with the Volkssturm. Translated as \\"Platoon Leader\\", a Zugf√ºhrer of the Volkssturm would oversee a platoon sized formation of Volkssturmmann. An army platoon is unusually led by a Leutnant, therefore, this rank was similar to that level. There was no established uniform for the rank, other than any particular military or paramilitary uniform already used by the holder of the position. Zugf√ºhrer was further a regular positional title used in both the Heer (army) and the Waffen-SS.

It is an active parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn and the archdeaconry of Blackburn. The oldest part of the church, the lower tower, dates from the 15th century, and there are several later additions and restorations. St Peter's is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History St Peter's lies close to the banks of the River Brun. There was a church on the site prior to 1122; this was largely rebuilt in the 1530s by Thomas Sellars and Nicholas Craven. The lower part of the tower is the oldest part of the current building and dates from the 15th or 16th century. There have been enough additions and alterations to the tower that Hartwell & Pevsner (2009) state that \\"little genuine C16 work survives\\". A gallery was added to the west in 1735 to accommodate the growing population of Burnley. The south aisle was rebuilt in 1789, and the north aisle in 1802. An upper part was added to the tower in 1803. Interior restoration work took place in 1854 by Miles Thompson, who built nave arcades and clerestory. In 1872‚Äî1873, the chancel was enlarged. Present day and assessment St Peter's was designated a Grade II* listed building on 10 November 1951. The Grade II* designation‚Äîthe second highest of the three grades‚Äîis for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". An active church in the Church of England, St Peter's is part of the diocese of Blackburn, which is in the Province of York. It is in the archdeaconry of Blackburn and the Deanery of Burnley. Architecture =Exterior= St Peter's is constructed of sandstone with slate roofs, and is in the late Perpendicular style. Its plan consists of a nave with a west tower, aisles to the north and south, and a chancel to the east. The tower is of four stages and has four-stage square, angled buttresses that reach halfway up the tower. The fourth stage of the tower is set back and has a crenellated parapet with pinnacles. There is a west doorway with a pointed arch and a hood mould. =Interior and fittings= St Peter's Church interior Internally, the tower is square. It has a vice (spiral staircase) in the south-east corner that is accessed through an external door. The nave measures by . It has a clerestory and arcades with arches over slender piers. There are two arches between the nave and the chancel. Churchyard The churchyard contains what Hartwell & Pevsner describe as a \\"good crop\\" of monuments, including some chest tombs from the 19th century. South of the church there is a group of monuments including one dedicated to the Chaffer family, one dedicated to the Kay family and one dedicated to the Waddington family; all of these have been given a Grade II designation by English Heritage. The Chaffer monument, approximately from the church, is from the late 19th century. It is constructed of sandstone in the Gothic Revival style and has corner pinnacles. The Kay Monument is approximately from the church and probably dates form the mid-19th century. It is a chest tomb built of sandstone and solid granite. The Gothic-style Waddington monument, about from the church, is a free-standing spire of sandstone from the 19th century. The scientist and astronomer Richard Towneley was buried at St Peter's Church in 1707. The sandstone churchyard wall and gates date from about 1807. The wall is about high and has gateways in the centre and south end. Additionally, there is a retaining wall on the north and west sides of the churchyard that also dates from about 1807, but includes some parts from 1736. This wall is built of coursed sandstone rubble.

The Social Justice Book site contains more than 60 carefully selected lists of multicultural and social justice books for children, young adults, and educators, along with dozens of book reviews coordinated by the See What We See (SWWS) coalition. History In the 1980s, with a growing Central American population and U.S. involvement in the region, 11 committees of educators and community leaders formed across the country to assess how to address the needs of Central American students and increase public awareness about U.S. foreign policy in Central America. These committees convened in Los Angeles to form a national organization, the Network of Educator‚Äôs Committees on Central America (NECCA) that became incorporated in December 1989History Teaching for Change website, 2017 Through the early 90s they produced teaching resources on Nicaragua and El Salvador and hosted teacher workshops around the country based on the book Rethinking Columbus.Rethinking Columbus, http://www.rethinkingschools.org/ProdDetails.asp?ID=094296120X Rethinking Schools. In 1993, NECCA won the Humanities award from the DC Humanities Council and in 1994 they launched a mail order catalog for progressive teaching resources. As the organization expanded its focus, Network of Educator's Committees on Central America changed its name to Teaching for Change. Through the 1990s, Teaching for Change organized seminars for educators on social justice education topics and published their own teaching guide, Beyond Heroes and Holidays: A Practical Guide to K-12 Anti-Racist, Multicultural Education and Staff Development. In 1999, Teaching for Change hosted a seminar for educators in the DC area focusing on \\"putting the movement back into Civil Rights\\" history teaching at Howard University. That seminar led to the production of a teaching guide with the same name, in collaboration with the Poverty and Race Resource Action Council (PRRAC). Putting the Movement Back into Civil Rights Teaching won the Philip C. Chinn book of the year award and Teaching for Change won the National Association for Multicultural Education Organization of the Year in 2004. In 2005, Teaching for Change was invited by former board member and entrepreneur Andy Shallal to open a bookstore in Busboys and Poets. In 2008, in partnership with Rethinking Schools, they launched the Zinn Education Project to provide middle and high school teachers with free access to lessons for Howard Zinn‚Äôs A People's History of the United States and other people's history resources. In 2014, Teaching for Change was attacked by Rush Limbaugh who said of the organization, \\"it‚Äôs racist, it‚Äôs bigoted.\\" Teaching for Change launched the Teach the Beat initiative to bring go-go artists to D.C. classrooms and was among the national recipients of the W.

Constructed during 1929‚Äì1931, the house was designed by Jeter O. Frye to resemble England's Canterbury Castle on the exterior and to evoke the Art Deco styling of Hollywood of the 1920s on the interior. The house included castle features such as a moat, drawbridge and turret and attracted paying tourists immediately following its completion. Canterbury Castle, Portland's only castle structure built in the 1930s, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The property was also designated as a Portland Historic Landmark. The house underwent major renovation efforts in the 2000s, but those efforts were not completed, and the house was demolished in 2009 after failing to meet municipal safety codes. The razing of Canterbury made Piggott's Castle the city's only remaining castle. Canterbury Castle was removed from the National Register of Historic Places in October 2010. Description Canterbury Castle was a private , three-story house located in Arlington Heights near Washington Park, offering views of downtown Portland. Constructed from basalt stone quarried from Rocky Butte, Note: Photographs taken by Dale Bernards in 1987. the house featured characteristics of a castle such as a moat, a drawbridge and a copper-topped turret. The wooden drawbridge covered a moat seven feet wide by more than three feet deep. A single-car garage, built into the hillside, was constructed during the same time as the house. The concrete foundation supported a rectangular ground plan. Canterbury featured \\"buttressing wing walls, cylindrical corner bays and a crenellated parapet of uncut stone\\". Round, arched and straight-topped frameless windows were often fitted with steel sashes. Doorways were also frameless, narrow and round or parabolic in shape. Doors had wrought iron hinges, handles and lock plates. The leaded glass slit window at the stair tower's top level featured a spiderweb pattern, a signature element of castle designer Jeter O. Frye's work. Windmill palms surrounding the property added to its exotic appearance. The Art Deco-style interior, meant to evoke a 1920s Hollywood style, featured mahogany woodwork, tile floors and chandeliers. The inside also contained Spanish-style white stucco, spiral staircases and wrought iron features including stair rails, built-in cabinetry door and window hardware and lighting fixtures. The house included a basement pool (which eventually closed due to water leaks), a stone fireplace in width, and small square windows. Also in the basement were the furnace, a storage room, and spaces for laundry and billiards. The main floor housed the garage, a kitchen and breakfast bay, the living and dining rooms and a music room. The master bedroom was adjacent to a deck above the dining and music rooms at the southwest corner of the property. Fireplaces and hallway floors featured brown ceramic tile; black glazed ceramic tile was used in the master bathroom, while black, red and yellow tiles were used in the breakfast bay. One of the castle's bathrooms was said to be modeled on Charlie Chaplin's. The interior was arranged around a central stair tower capped with a conical roof clad in copper. Chimneys vented the centrally located furnace and rose from fireplaces in the house's west hall. History The house's exterior, 2009 Canterbury Castle was designed by Jeter O. Frye and constructed between 1929 and 1931. Immediately following construction, Frye was unable to sell the house and left Portland in bankruptcy to resume his career in California. Visitors immediately showed interest in touring the house. The castle attracted paying tourists and school groups, became a stop on the Washington Park bus tour and hosted Halloween parties for a local radio station. The house became known as Canterbury Castle over time due to the plat and name of the street on which it was situated. The terraced garden was eliminated in the 1950s when a portion of the land was sold. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under the ownership of Dale and Karen Bernards, who had submitted an application for listing one year prior. Canterbury Castle during demolition in 2009 Sidney Lynne and John Hefferin purchased the house for $469,900 in 2004 after it had been unoccupied for more than a year. By then, the structure had developed leaks and displayed cracks along the foundation, walls and ceiling. In 2006, a falling tree caused stones to break away, damaging the house's main gas line. The couple spent $200,000 over four years to reinforce the walls. Lynne and Hefferin also constructed exterior stairs and an underground retaining wall. However, the renovation process was not completed, as they were unable to pay for all repairs required by the city, which had issued $20,000 in fines on the property. The couple also struggled to pay for costly landslide prevention efforts, rising property taxes and high heating bills. Canterbury Castle was listed for sale in the summer of 2008 for $2 million. Lynne invited local interior design students and contractors to upgrade the house's interior, without success. The couple left the house in January 2009, and ownership was turned over to JPMorgan Chase. Lynne began a \\"one-woman crusade\\" to save the castle, seeking assistance from Portland City Commissioner Randy Leonard and from home improvement expert and This Old House host Bob Vila. In February 2009, the city's bureau of development services found that unstable soil and the risk of stones separating from sheeting underneath posed a landslide risk. The property had missing stones and thick cracks several feet long, which presented hazards to residents and the street below. Rumors of demolition began to surface in March 2009. The house being demolished, 2009 In April 2009, the house was purchased by Robert Stansel, who had lived next door to the house for several years, at a foreclosure auction for $280,000. Demolition began in May 2009; the house was considered \\"structurally unsound\\" by the local government, a determination that permitted demolition despite the house's listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Lynne said of the house and its demolition: \\"It's totally like a death and completely unnecessary. It's a magical property that invokes hope and imagination in people. We had a really great time with it.\\" Residents shared mixed feelings about the demolition. Stansel was able to salvage 21 tiles with neo-Aztec designs. In 2009, The Oregonian reported that Stansel would wait until the economy and housing market improved before deciding whether to sell the land or build a new structure. Canterbury Castle was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on October 13, 2010. The demolition of Canterbury Castle made Piggott's Castle in southwest Portland the last remaining castle in the city. The property had also been listed as a Portland Historic Landmark and was the city's only castle structure constructed in the 1930s. Two stones from Canterbury Castle serve as steps in the zen garden of Stansel's home in East Hampton, New York.

After his father's death in 1536, Henry initially ruled M√ºnsterberg-Oels jointly with his brothers Joachim, John and George II. In a joint deed dated 25 June 1535, they awarded the city of Srebrna G√≥ra (Silberberg), which belonged to M√ºnsterberg, the status of free mining town. Unlike their father, Joachim and his brothers followed the Lutheran doctrine. In 1537, they expelled the Catholic priests from M√ºnsterberg (Ziƒôbice) and appointed an evangelical vicar. In 1542, Henry and his brothers pledged the heavily indebted Duchy of M√ºnsterberg to their uncle Duke Frederick II of Legnica. John continued to rule the Duchy of Oels and Henry II ruled until 1548 the Duchy of Bernstadt. Joachim, the oldest of the brothers became Bishop of Brandenburg. Henry chose Bierut√≥w as his residence, and promoted Protestantism there. He expanded Bierut√≥w Palace, adding the south wing. After six years in office, he died in 1548.

They are proteases: they cut the polypeptide chain of other proteins. This proteolytic cleavage is irreversible in cells, and an important type of cellular regulation. Although proteases are one of the earliest and best studied class of enzyme, rhomboids belong to a much more recently discovered type: the intramembrane proteases. What is unique about intramembrane proteases is that their active sites are buried in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, and they cleave other transmembrane proteins within their transmembrane domains. About 30% of all proteins have transmembrane domains, and their regulated processing often has major biological consequences. Accordingly, rhomboids regulate many important cellular processes, and may be involved in a wide range of human diseases. Intramembrane proteases Rhomboids are intramembrane serine proteases. The other types of intramembrane protease are aspartyl- and metallo-proteases, respectively. The presenilins and signal peptide peptidase-like family, which are intramembrane aspartyl proteases, cleave substrates that include the Notch receptor and the amyloid precursor protein, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The site-2 protease family, which are intramembrane metalloproteases, regulate among other things cholesterol biosynthesis and stress responses in bacteria. The different intramembrane protease families are evolutionarily and mechanistically unrelated, but there are clear common functional themes that link them. Rhomboids are perhaps the best characterised class.  History  Rhomboids were first named after a mutation in the fruit fly Drosophila, discovered in a famous genetic screen that led to a Nobel Prize for Christiane N√ºsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus.G. J√ºrgens, E. Wieschaus, C. N√ºsslein- Volhard, H. Kluding, Wilhelm Roux‚Äôs Arch\\" Dev. Biol 1984; 193, 283 In that screen they found a number of mutants with similar phenotypes: ‚Äòpointy‚Äô embryonic head skeletons. They named them each with a pointy-themed name ‚Äì one was rhomboid. Genetic analysis later proved that this group of genes were members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signalling pathway,M. A. Sturtevant, M. Roark, E. Bier, Genes Dev. 7, 961 (1993) and that rhomboid was needed to generate the signal that activates the EGF receptor. The molecular function of rhomboid took a bit longer to unravel but a combination of genetics and molecular techniques led to the discovery that Drosophila rhomboid and other members of the family were the first known intramembrane serine proteases.  Function  Rhomboids were first discovered as proteases that regulate EGF receptor signalling in Drosophila. By releasing the extracellular domain of the growth factor Spitz, from its transmembrane precursor, rhomboid triggers signalling. Since then, many other important biological functions have been proposed. * Although less well established than in Drosophila, there is some evidence that rhomboids may participate in growth factor signalling in mammals, including humans. They have also been implicated in ephrin signalling, the cleavage of the anticoagulant protein thrombomodulin and wound healing. * All eukaryotes have a mitochondrial rhomboid. In yeast this has been shown to control mitochondrial function and morphology by regulating membrane fusion via the cleavage of a dynamin-like GTPase called Mgm1p, the orthologue of human OPA1. In Drosophila, the mitochondrial rhomboid also regulates mitochondrial membrane fusion. In mammals too, mitochondrial function is disrupted in mutants of PARL, the mitochondrial rhomboid, but the range of functions is more complex. PARL regulates the remodelling of mitochondrial cristae, is implicated in cell death and metabolism, and there is increasing evidence of an important role in Parkinson's disease; * Apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium (the agent that causes malaria) and Toxoplasma appear to use rhomboids to cleave cell surface proteins that participate in the host invasion process. Rhomboids have also been implicated in the pathogenicity of other parasites. * A rhomboid in the Gram-negative bacterium Providencia stuartii is required for the function of the twin- arginine protein translocation (TAT) machinery.  Structure  Rhomboids were the first intramembrane proteases for which a high resolution crystal structure was solved. These structures confirmed predictions that rhomboids have a core of six transmembrane domains, and that the catalytic site depends on a serine and histidine catalytic dyad. The structures also explained how a proteolytic reaction, which requires water molecules, can occur in the hydrophobic environment of a lipid bilayer: one of the central mysteries of intramembrane proteases. The active site of rhomboid protease is in a hydrophilic indentation, in principle accessible to water from the bulk solution. However, it has been proposed that there might be an auxiliary mechanism to facilitate access of water molecules to the catalytic dyad at the bottom of the active site to ensure catalytic efficiency. The active site of rhomboid protease is protected laterally from the lipid bilayer by its six constituent transmembrane helices, suggesting that substrate access to rhomboid active site is regulated. One area of uncertainty has been the route of substrate access. Substrates were initially proposed to enter between transmembrane segments (TMSs) 1 and 3, but current evidence strongly supports an alternative access point, between TMSs 2 and 5. This notion is also supported by the fact that mutations in TMS 5 have only a marginal effect on the thermodynamic stability of rhomboid, unlike other regions of the molecule. Very recently, the first ever co-crystal structure of an intramembrane protease - the Escherichia coli rhomboid protease GlpG - and a substrate- derived peptide bound in the active site confirms and extends this substrate access model and provides implications for the mechanism of other rhomboid- superfamily proteins. The details of how a substrate TMS may be recognized by rhomboid are however still unclear. Some authors propose that substrate access involves a large lateral displacement movement of TMS 5 to open up the core of rhomboid. Other reports instead suggest that large lateral movement of TMS 5 is not required, and propose that the surface of TMSs 2 and 5 rather serves as an \\"intramembrane exosite\\" mediating the recognition of substrate TMS.  Enzymatic specificity  Rhomboids do not cleave all transmembrane domains. In fact, they are highly specific, with a limited number of substrates. Most natural Rhomboid substrates known so far are type 1 single transmembrane domain proteins, with their amino termini in the luminal/extracellular compartment. However, recent studies suggested that type 2 membrane protein (i.e. with opposite topology: the amino terminus is cytoplasmic), or even multipass membrane proteins could act as rhomboid substrates. The specificity of rhomboids underlies their ability to control functions in a wide range of biological processes and, in turn, understanding what makes a particular transmembrane domain into a rhomboid substrate can shed light on rhomboid function in different contexts. Initial work indicated that rhomboids recognise instability of the transmembrane alpha-helix at the site of cleavage as the main substrate determinant. More recently, it has been found that rhomboid substrates are defined by two separable elements: the transmembrane domain and a primary sequence motif in or immediately adjacent to it. This recognition motif directs where the substrate is cleaved, which can occur either within, or just outside, the transmembrane domain, in the juxtamembrane region. In the former case helix destabilising residues downstream in substrate TMS are also necessary for efficient cleavage. A detailed enzyme kinetics analysis has in fact shown that the recognition motif interactions with rhomboid active site determine the kcat of substrate cleavage. The principles of substrate TMS recognition by rhomboid remain poorly understood, but numerous lines of evidence indicate that rhomboids (and perhaps also other intramembrane proteases) somehow recognise the structural flexibility or dynamics of transmembrane domain of their substrates. Full appreciation of the biophysical and structural principles involved will require structural characterisation of the complex of rhomboid with the full transmembrane substrate. As a first step towards this goal, a recent co-crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with a substrate-derived peptide containing mechanism- based inhibitor explains the observed recognition motif sequence preferences in rhomboid substrates structurally, and provides a significant advance in the current understanding of rhomboid specificity and mechanism of rhomboid-family proteins. In some Gram-negative bacteria, including Shewanella and Vibrio, up to thirteen proteins are found with GlyGly-CTERM, a C-terminal homology domain consisting of a glycine-rich motif, a highly hydrophobic transmembrane helix, and a cluster of basic residues. This domain appears to be the recognition sequence for rhombosortase, a branch of the rhomboid protease family limited to just those bacteria with the GlyGly-CTERM domain.  Medical significance  The diversity of biological functions already known to depend on rhomboids is reflected in evidence that rhomboids play a role in a variety of diseases including cancer, parasite infection, and diabetes.< It is important to note, however, that there is no case yet established where a precise medical significance is fully validated. No drugs that modulate rhomboid activity have yet been reported, although a recent study has identified small molecule, mechanism-based inhibitors that could provide a basis for future drug development.  The rhomboid-like family  Rhomboid proteases appear to be conserved in all eukaryotes and the vast majority of prokaryotes. Bioinformatic analysis highlights that some members of the rhomboid family lack the amino acid residues essential for proteolysis, implying that they cannot cleave substrates. These ‚Äòpseudoproteases‚Äô include a subfamily that have been named the iRhoms (also known as RHBDF1 and RHBDF2). iRhoms can promote the ER associated degradation (ERAD) of EGF receptor ligands in Drosophila, thus providing a mechanism for regulating EGF receptor activity in the brain. This implies that the fundamental cellular quality control mechanism is exploited by multicellular organisms to regulate signalling between cells. In mice, iRhoms are key trafficking chaperones required for the ER export of ADAM17/TACE and its maturation. iRhoms are thus required for the TNF-alpha and EGF receptor signalling, making them medically highly attractive. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that rhomboids are in fact members of a larger rhomboid-like superfamily or clan, which includes the derlin proteins, also involved in ERAD.

Through his military career he saw active service on the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, Second Anglo-Maratha War and Third Anglo-Maratha War. Early life Vaughan was born in Gloucestershire, England, in 1778. At the age of seventeen he departed to India, as he obtained a cadetship to serve in the East India Company‚Äôs Bengal Army. Military career In 1797 he obtained a commission as Lieutenant in the 2nd Regiment of Native Infantry. His regiment was one of the few Bengal Army units involved in the campaigns during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798‚Äì1799) until the siege and battle of Seringapatam. At the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803, Lieutenant John Vaughan received orders to raise a battalion of sepoys in the area of Fatehgarh for the purpose of adding a new regiment to the establishment. This battalion would be the 1st Battalion of the newly created 21st Bengal Native Infantry, posted in the 2nd Infantry Brigade of Lord Lake‚Äôs army during the whole Maratha War. At the departure of the commander in chief, General Lord Gerard Lake to England in 1807, his Excellency recognised the role of the 21st N. I. with a letter were stated \\"I shall ever remain grateful for the important services, which in the course of the war, were rendered by the officers of the 21st regiment of Native Infantry\\". On 19 November 1807, Capt-Lieutenant Vaughan was promoted to the rank of Captain in the 21st N.I. In April 1815, at the final period of the Napoleonic Wars, the British Sovereign appointed some senior general officers serving in India Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. At the end of 1815, Captain Vaughan is intrusted to bring from London the insignias intended of the Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath resident in India to Calcutta on board the H. C. Ship Carnatic. In the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817‚Äì1819), Captain Vaughan serves in the General Staff of the Bengal Army as Assistant Adjutant General. In this capacity he accompanied Francis Rawdon- Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings, then Governor-General and commander in chief, in the Centre Division for the whole campaign of the Grand Army. In the course of war he was promoted to the rank of Major on 1 February 1818. On 15 February 1822, Major John Vaughan was appointed to the staff position of Town and Fort Major of Fort William in Calcutta and will only vacate the appointment with his death in 1830. Next year, from 13 January 1823 to 1 August, Vaughan was supernumerary Aide-de-Camp to the acting Governor-General, John Adam. When Lord Amherst, the new Governor-General approached Calcutta by ship on 30 July 1823, Major Vaughan was sent on board with a 4 member‚Äôs deputation to greet and escort him to Calcutta on the next day in order to make the solemn oaths as Governor-General of Fort William. On 11 July 1823, Vaughan was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and given command of the 1st Battalion, 4th Reg. Native Infantry. Following the 1824 Bengal Army infantry regiments reorganization, Lt-Col. Vaughan was posted to be the Lieutenant- Colonel of the 18th Regiment N. I, on 11 June. 15 November 1824, Lt-Col. Vaughan was nominated a member of the Special Court of Enquiry ordered by the Government of India under instruction of the commander in chief, to investigate the causes and deal with the first sepoy mutiny at Barrackpore (2 Nov. 1824). In 1828, Vaughan was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant, 8 February, and again chosen, on 13 March, to be supernumerary Aide-de-Camp to the acting Governor-General, now William Butterworth Bayley (later chairman of the British East India Company). On 2 April 1828 and until his death in 1830, John Vaughan assumed the command of 37th Regiment of Native Infantry. At the same year, Vaughan was appointed Aide-de-Camp to the new Governor-General of India, General Lord William Bentinck on 26 September. As A.D.C. to the Governor General, Vaughan accompanied Lord William Bentinck in his visit to the Presidency of Penang, Malacca and Singapore in early 1829. On 5 June, Lt- Col. Commandant Vaughan was promoted to Colonel. In July 1830, Colonel Vaughan accompanied General the Earl of Dalhousie, commander in chief Bengal Army, in his voyage to China. On 1 November 1830, Colonel Vaughan, at the age of 52 years, died in Fort William, India, at Calcutta. Personal life Colonel John Vaughan was a bachelor all his life. He was brother of late Capt. Thomas Vaughan Royal North Gloucester Militia and uncle of Amelia Vaughan Jones Woollett. At 4 May 1825, Lt. Colonel Vaughan was elected as member of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta.

It was observed as early as 2000, but the object was not confirmed as one in orbit of the star HIP 78530 until a direct imaging project photographed the star in 2008. The image caught the attention of the project's science team, so the team followed up on its initial observations. HIP 78530 b orbits a young, hot, bright blue star in the Upper Scorpius association. The planet itself is over twenty-three times more massive than Jupiter, orbiting eighteen times further from its host star than Pluto does from the Sun by the estimates published in its discovery paper. In this predicted orbit, HIP 78530 b completes an orbit every twelve thousand years. Discovery Between 2000 and 2001, the ADONIS system at the ESO 3.6 m Telescope in Chile detected a faint object in the vicinity of HIP 78530. This object was reported in 2005 and 2007, although the astronomers investigating the star were not able to tell, based on their observations, if the faint object was an orbiting companion or not. The team did not follow up on this. The North telescope of the Gemini Observatory, which directly imaged the HIP 78530 system. The random selection of ninety-one stars in the Upper Scorpius association provided a sample of stars to be observed using the Near Infrared Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) and Altitude conjugate Adaptive Optics for the Infrared (ALTAIR) adaptive optics system at the Gemini Observatory. Among the ninety stars selected for direct imaging was the star HIP 78530, which was first imaged by the camera on May 24, 2008. This initial image revealed the presence of the same faint object within the vicinity of HIP 78530. Follow-up imaging took place on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this companion object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered in the spring and summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature. On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, use of the NIFS integral field spectrograph with ALTAIR allowed the astronomers to collect data on the spectrum of the faint object and its star. Analysis of the spectra and the objects' astrometry (how the star and the faint object change position in the sky) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b. The confirmation of HIP 78530 b was reported on January 24, 2011. In imaging the ninety-one stars, HIP 78530 b and 1RXSJ1609-2105b were discovered. The discoveries of these two orbiting bodies allowed astronomers to predict that bodies with such low planet/brown dwarf-to-star mass ratios (below 0.01) orbiting at a distance of hundreds of AU exists in the orbits of 2.2% of all stars. However, this number is a lower limit, as astronomers have been unable to detect smaller, low-mass planets that fit this scenario. Host star HIP 78530 is a bright, blue B-type main sequence star in the Upper Scorpius association, a loose star cluster composed of stars with a common origin. The star is estimated to be approximately 2.5 times the mass of the Sun. Ages of the Upper Scorpius group have been quoted at 5 million years, however a more recent estimate suggests that the group is somewhat older (approximately 11 million years old). Its effective temperature is estimated at 10500 K, less than twice the effective temperature of the Sun. HIP 78530 has an apparent magnitude of 7.18. It is incredibly faint, if visible at all, as seen from the unaided eye of an observer on Earth. Characteristics HIP 78530 b is most likely a brown dwarf, a massive object that is large enough to fuse deuterium (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between whether or not it is a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner. Its estimated mass is over 23.04 times that of Jupiter. Additionally, HIP 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated average distance of 710 AU, which is 710 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit. The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto and the Sun is 39.482 AU, meaning that HIP 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun. In accordance with the data, HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, but it has not been directly observed long enough to know definitively.

The Arab league, United Nations and Western governments in 2011 quickly condemned the Syrian government's response to the protests which later evolved into the Syrian Civil War as overly heavy-handed and violent. Many Middle Eastern governments initially expressed support for the government and its \\"security measures\\", but as the death toll mounted, especially in Hama, they switched to a more balanced approach, criticizing violence from both government and protesters. Russia and China vetoed two attempts at United Nations Security Council sanctions against the Syrian government.  International peace plans  Since late 2011, peace plans or initiatives have been launched by the Arab League, Russia, and the United Nations.

On 3 August, the United Nations Security Council, in a non-binding statement, condemned Syrian authorities for attacking civilians, in its first pronouncement on Syria since March. The statement, which did not threaten economic sanctions and lacked the full stature of a resolution, was disavowed by Security Council member Lebanon. : Investigation on human rights violations On 22 August 2011, the 'Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic' was set up by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate human rights violations during the Syrian civil war.

Ashton reiterated the EU's condemnation on 31 July after military operations in the city of Hama resulted in at least 136 deaths. Ashton said on 18 August, \\"The EU notes the complete loss of Bashar al-Assad's legitimacy in the eyes of the Syrian people and the necessity for him to step aside.\\" = Gulf Co-operation Council = In a 6 August 2011 joint statement of GCC governments, the Persian Gulf grouping criticized \\"mounting violence and the excessive use of force which resulted in killing and wounding large numbers\\" and \\"express[ed] sorrow for the continuous bloodshed\\".

We hope the international community continues to play a constructive role in this regard.\\" On 4 October 2011, Russia and China vetoed a resolution that would have threatened the Syrian government with targeted sanctions if it continued military actions, claiming they wanted to prevent a \\"Libyan intervention scenario\\". Later they admonished the Syrian Government, expressing their desire for them to reform and respect the will of the Syrian people. Chinese media blamed violence in China's Xinjiang province in June 2013 on extremists from Syria. The Global Times reported that members of an East Turkestan faction had traveled from Turkey to Syria. \\"This Global Times reporter has recently exclusively learned from the Chinese anti-terrorism authorities that since 2012, some members of the 'East Turkestan' faction have entered Syria from Turkey, participated in extremist, religious and terrorist organisations within the Syrian opposition forces and fought against the Syrian army. At the same time, these elements from 'East Turkestan' have identified candidates to sneak into Chinese territory to plan and execute terrorist attacks.\\" It also cited the arrest of 23-year-old Maimaiti Aili, of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), and said that he had fought in the Syrian civil war. Dilxat Raxit, the Sweden- based spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, denied Uyghur involvement.

The Guardian reported that the Iranian government was assisting the Syrian government with riot control equipment, intelligence monitoring techniques, oil supply and snipers. Allegedly Iran sent the Syrian government $9 billion to help it withstand the sanctions.\\"Syria's crisis: The long road to Damascus: There are signs that the Syrian regime may become still more violent\\", The Economist, dated 11 Feb 2012. Then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in an interview with the Lebanese television news network Al-Manar on 25 August 2011 that the violence should end and \\"the people and government of Syria\\" should join in a national dialogue. \\"When there is a problem between the people and their leaders, they must sit down together to reach a solution, away from violence\\", Ahmadinejad said. However, he told Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani of Qatar on 26 August that he believed that any \\"interference of foreigners and domineering powers in the regional countries' internal affairs would complicate the situation\\". Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi on 27 August 2011, said the Syrian government should respond to the people's \\"legitimate demands\\". However, Salehi also cautioned that a \\"power vacuum\\" in Syria could have \\"unprecedented repercussions\\" for the region. On 15 August, while visiting Cairo, high-ranking Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi condemned the actions of Syrian protesters, claiming they were U.S. agents trying to destabilize Syria to benefit Israel. On the same day an alleged defector from the Syrian secret police claimed that Iranian soldiers, including snipers, were working alongside Syrian police, paramilitary, and military units fighting to put down the uprising. In May 2013 Iranian Ambassador to the UN Mohammad Khazaee spoke about the Geneva II Middle East peace conference. He stated: > We believe that, apart from the Syrian sides, all relevant regional and > international partners that wield some influence over the parties and could > help the Syrians move towards peace should participate in the conference and > endeavour towards its success.

Is anyone pleased by Syria's destruction apart from Israel?\\", he said. =Iraq= On 3 April 2011, Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki called Assad and voiced Iraq's support of Syria \\"in the face of conspiracies targeting Syria's stability\\". However, on 9 August 2011 the Council of Representatives of Iraq issued a statement demanding reforms and an immediate halt to violence, which read in part: \\"We call to stop all non- peaceful practices, and all actions for suppression of freedoms and bloodshed is condemned and unacceptable.\\" Speaker Usama al-Nujayfi condemned the use of violence by the government and said, \\"For the sake of the Syrian people, we demand the government, out of its responsibility to safeguard the lives of its people and their property, take the bold and courageous steps to stop the bleeding.\\" However, Maliki appeared unswayed in his support for Assad, blaming protesters for trying to \\"sabotage\\" Syria and saying they should \\"use the democratic process, not riots, to voice their displeasure\\". Iraqi Ambassador to the United States Samir Sumaida'ie said in an interview with a Foreign Policy blog, on 25 August 2011, that he believed Assad's government was \\"steadily losing its friends, its credibility, and its grip\\" and would eventually collapse, which would \\"alter the balance of power in the region and will eventually weaken Iran and reduce its capacity to project its power through Hezbollah, Hamas, and other instruments\\". He said Baghdad is not concerned about any potential instability that may arise from Assad's ouster. Muqtada al-Sadr, the cleric that leads the Sadr Movement, expressed support for Assad, saying that \\"there is a big difference between what is happening in Syria and the great revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain and Yemen, one of the reasons behind this difference is that Bashar al-Assad is against the U.S. and Israeli presence and his attitudes are clear, not like those who collapsed before him, or will collapse.\\" He also warned that the demonstrations could bring Syria into \\"an abyss of terrorism and fragmentation in the event of a vacuum in power. However, on 27 April 2013, Al-Maliki expressed concern, stating that \\"a plague of sectarianism\\" was sweeping Iraq as it had in Syria. Following the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack on 4 April 2017, Sadr called for Assad to step down. = Israel = Israeli reactions have been mixed, with some claiming change in Syria would weaken their enemy Iran, and others countering that a change of government might be more dangerous.

I hope to see those regarding the Iranian regime and the Syrian regime.\\" Israel expressed concern that Assad would try to divert attention from Syria by provoking border incidents with Israel in the Golan Heights, Lebanon or Gaza or even start a war with Israel to unite the Syrian people. On 12 May 2011, Shin Bet said: Syria would be \\"soaked in blood\\", because Assad's government was \\"fighting for its life\\". On 4 March 2012, Lieberman called on the international community to intervene. On 10 June 2012, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that an \\"axis of evil\\" was behind the atrocities in Syria. Netanyahu told the Cabinet that Iran and the militant group Hezbollah were assisting the Syrian government in the massacre of civilians. President Shimon Peres, said that the international community was not doing enough to stop the violence and urged the West to intervene.  Labour party  Labour MK Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said in May 2013: \\"whether Assad remains in power or not, is not in our hands. We keep hearing intelligence assessments that he is about to go down. In my opinion, the current situation is the best one for us. Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom do you talk and who do you hold accountable?\\" Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that \\"I always thought that it might be the case that at the end of the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand. And I think that this is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [The government] might not just survive but even regain territories.\\" The statement was met with a cool reception by the foreign and defense ministries.  Other reactions  On January 10, 2012, Benny Gantz, the Israeli military chief of staff, informed members of the Knesset that in the event of the Syrian government's collapse, Israel was prepared to permit fleeing Syrian Alawites settlement in the Golan Heights. Former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy suggested that Israel should exploit the Shia-Sunni conflict. On 2 April 2011, in the village of Buq'ata, in the Golan Heights, 2,000 Druze protested in support of Assad, waving Syrian flags and portraits. = Pakistan = Pakistan adopted a policy of neutrality, calling for a political settlement through an \\"inclusive\\" dialogue in 2012. Pakistan abstained from the Security Council sanctions vote. Instead, Pakistan together with Britain, submitted a new draft resolution to authorize an extension to the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS). Historically, Pakistan has maintained strong political relations with the Assad family, dating back to the 1970s. According to the view of Khurshid Kasuri, Pakistan's silence was a product of \\"historical links between the Bhutto and al-Assad families.\\" At the conference held by Iran, Pakistan urged the international community to respect Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The Pakistan government emphasized peaceful solutions and opposed military action. In 2013, Pakistan's official policy statement stated, \\"Pakistan's stand on Syria is based on principles of international law and UN Charter to respect [t]erritorial integrity of Syria; the policy of non- military or otherwise intervention and interference; settlement of dispute; and transition or transfer of power through peaceful means.\\" On 17 February 2014, Islamabad stated its support for \\"the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers enabling it to take charge of the affairs of the country\\". The statement, which followed a Saudi delegation's visit to Pakistan, came despite a Pakistani government official's claim that Pakistan's policy had not changed. In December 2015, Pakistan foreign affairs stated that it is against any attempt to topple the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. = Lebanon = On 31 March 2011, Prime Minister- designate Najib Mikati commended the \\"ending of the chance to cause strife in Syria\\" and hailed the Syrian people's \\"support\\" for their president. Also, President Michel Suleiman highlighted the importance of stability in Syria, and its positive impact on the security of and economic situation in Lebanon and Syria. On 3 August 2011, Lebanon was the only United Nations Security Council member to disassociate itself from a presidential statement read by the Indian delegate condemning the Syrian government. Hezbollah announced support Assad, citing their status as a state of \\"resistance\\". Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah suggested that the downfall of the Syrian government was an interest of the United States and Israel. The Syrian opposition accused Hezbollah of aiding the government. A news report suggested that Hezbollah was planning a military coup in Lebanon should the Assad government fall, with the assistance of the Free Patriotic Movement. Druze politician Walid Jumblatt expressed concern during an interview in Beirut about a full-scale civil war in Syria. Jumblatt said Assad was not listening to advice from former allies like Turkish Prime Minister Erdoƒüan, adding, \\"Up 'til now he has refused to listen to the rightful demands of the Syrian people for a new Syria.\\" Jumblatt however, retracted his previous staments and admitted that the rebels do not really represent a new Syria, he now agrees with hezbollah stance regarding the conflict. On 27 September 2013, President Michel Sleiman said that \\"Withdrawing from Syria should result from the implementation of the Baabda Declaration and those involved in Syria should place Lebanon's interest above others,\\" in an implicit reference to Hezbollah, he further added that \\"Lebanon's interest lies in maintaining distance and refraining from interference in Syria and I hope that everyone commits to that and the Baabda Declaration by withdrawing from Syria.\\" = Russia =  April 2011  In regards to Russia's role in the Syrian civil war, on 6 April 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called al-Assad to voice support for the latter's decision to enact reforms. On 28 April 2011, Russian UN Ambassador Alexandor Pankin warned against \\"taking sides\\", as \\"such approaches lead to a never-ending circle of violence\\". Russian and other intellectuals affirmed that Russia would not tolerate any interference in Syria. One reasons given for Russian opposition to any action by the UN or other organizations was their fear that the West would intervene on the side of the rebels. Alexander Fionik said that \\"Russia has seen what happened in Libya. It would be logical to assume that Russia's stance on Syria would be more clear-cut than that on Libya\\". Another reason noted was Russia's close relations with the Syrian government. Syria was one of the few governments to back Russia's 2008 military intervention in Georgia. Alexander Shumlin wrote, \\"The fall of the Syrian regime will mean the disappearance of Russia's last partner in conducting Soviet-style policies in the Middle East whose essence in many ways boiled down to countering the United States\\".  May 2011  Russia has in early 2011 blocked a first US/European draft resolution in the UN Security Council attempting to condemn Syrian use of force, and has on 12 May 2011 blocked a report on Iranian arm sales to Assad. A council diplomat said, that Russia objected to \\"the publication of the report as an official Security Council document\\", but another council diplomat stated, \\"It's obviously an attempt to protect (Syrian President) Bashar al-Assad\\". The vetoed report had apparently contained material incriminating both the leadership of Iran and Syria in the transmission of arms to militant groups. Russia vetoed the first draft of the US/European resolution fearing it could lead to interference in Syrian affairs.  June 2011  On 2 June 2011, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: \\"It is not in the interests of anyone to send messages to the opposition in Syria or elsewhere that if you reject all reasonable offers we will come and help you as we did in Libya ... It's a very dangerous position.\\" He continued that, \\"the situation doesn't present a threat to international peace and security ... Syria is a very important country in the Middle East and destabilizing Syria would have repercussions far beyond its borders\\" and asserted that Assad had made attempts at major reform. On 10 June, Russia with China used their Security Council veto to block the second draft of the Franco-British sponsored US/European resolution attempting to condemn Syrian use of force, again because they feared it could lead to interference in Syrian affairs. An interview in the Voice of Russia stated, \\"What arouses concern is that in this resolution of Britain and France declares illegitimacy of the regime of Bashar Assad. That means that the approval of the resolution will make it possible for others countries to doubt the legitimacy of the regime on the base of this document.\\" 11 June, protesters in Homs burned the Russian flag and carried signs with anti-Russian slogans in protest to Russia's supporting Assad.Al Jazeera Syria Live Blog: Saturday, June 11, 2011 - 10:33. On the other hand, the following Friday 17 June, diaspora Syrians in Lebanon rallied in front of the Russian and Chinese embassies to \\"express their gratitude for Russia and China's support for Damascus and [to reject] the conspiracies sought against Syria\\". A Syrian anti-government delegation on 28 June visited Moscow and met with Russian envoy Mikhail Margelov, who after the meeting noted that \\"leaders come and go\\" and called for \\"an end to any and all forms of violence\\", which some interpreted to be a shift away from Assad. Such a change was considered potentially hazardous for the Syrian government, given its reliance on Russia for weapons and diplomatic and economic support.  July‚ÄìAugust 2011  On 19 July 2011, Medvedev said he was working with German Chancellor Merkel on a strategy to persuade the Syrian government to abandon violence and begin a constructive dialogue with protesters. He did not threaten to veto to oppose a Security Council resolution critical of the Syrian government. Medvedev also said it was imperative that Syria not slide into civil war as Libya had. Amid 2011 the siege of Hama, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement documenting deaths in Hama as well as condemning the violence, including the alleged killing of eight Syrian policemen. The statement beseeched the pro-Assad forces in addition to the violent protesters to \\"exercise maximum restraint\\". On August 3, 2011, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin stated that Russia would not oppose a UN resolution condemning the violence in Syria as long as it does not include sanctions or other \\"pressures\\". Al Jazeera reported that Russia had \\"softened the blow\\" to the Assad government by insisting that the UN make a \\"statement\\" rather than a \\"resolution\\".Al Jazeera Libya Live Blog.Thursday, August 4, 2011 - 07:32 entry On 23 August 2011, the Russian delegation, along with those of China and Cuba, took to the floor to denounce a UN inquiry on Assad's human rights violations. Churkin stated that \\"We hope to see progress, we hope to see dialogue established in Syria...We think we should continue to work within the scope of that unified position.\\" On 26 August 2011, according to UN envoys, the US/European effort to impose sanctions was meeting \\"fierce resistance\\" from Russia and China, with Churkin threatening to use Russia's veto. The arms embargo would prevent Russian firms (Syria's main armoury) from selling to Syria. Russia proposed a \\"rival\\" resolution for voting, described as \\"toothless\\" by Western diplomats, that did not include sanctions or other punitive measures, but rather urged Syria to accelerate its reforms.  October‚ÄìDecember 2011  On October 29, 2011, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's Federation Council, Mikhail Margelov said that the position of the Arab League, which called upon Assad to stop killing might lead to the end of bloodshed. Margelov also said that Syrian methods hamper implementation of inevitable reforms.RIA Novosti, October 29, 2011, Russian govt official Margelov sees Arab League's view on Syria constructive On 1 November 2011, Lavrov said that Russia would oppose the proposal for a no-fly zone in Syria as (in Russia's view) the no-fly zone in Libya had been used to \\"support one side in a civil war\\". Lavrov nonetheless claimed that \\"we are not protecting any regime\\". In late November 2011 a naval flotilla led by the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov returned to its naval base in Tartus as a show of support for the al-Assad government. However, in an apparent contradiction, a Russian naval spokesman stated, \\"The call of the Russian ships in Tartus should not be seen as a gesture towards what is going on in Syria\\", and \\"This was planned already in 2010 when there were no such events there. There has been active preparation and there is no need to cancel this\\", noting that the Admiral Kuznetsov would also be making port calls in Beirut, Genoa and Cyprus. On 15 December 2011, Russia proposed a Security Council resolution condemning the violence \\"by all parties, including disproportionate use of force by Syrian authorities\\". The draft resolution also raised concern over \\"the illegal supply of weapons to the armed groups in Syria\\". Western diplomats initially referred to the proposed resolution as a basis for negotiations. The proposal was an updated version of a Russo-Chinese draft from a few months earlier.  2012  Russia continued to ship arms to the government, with one ship loaded with \\"dangerous cargo\\" notably having to stop in Cyprus on 10 January 2012 due to stormy weather. Russia's current arms contracts with Syria are estimated to be 1.5 billion US dollars, compromising 10% of Russia's global arms sales. Syria also hosts a Russian navy base at Tartus, Russia's last military base outside the borders of the former USSR. Russia's arms sales sparked anger and criticism on the part of certain Western and Arab nations. The Russian government, for its part, defended its sales by pointing out that they did not violate any standing arms embargoes. By the end of January 2012, a resolution proposal, competing with the Russian proposal of December 2011, had been drafted by Western and Arab powers which did not condemn violence by both sides and did not rule out military intervention. Russia indicated that it would not agree to the Western-Arab draft, and that it would continue to promote its own resolution. In early February 2012, Russia (along with China) vetoed the Western-Arab draft.  2013  Early 2013, Rebel Chechen fighters joined the Syrian opposition's fight against the government. On 11 September 2013, a New York Times editorial written by Vladimir Putin appeared regarding international events related to the United States, Russia and Syria. = Turkey = Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said on 2 April 2011, that he would press Assad on 4 April to remove emergency rule, release political prisoners and adopt a new constitution. President Abdullah G√ºl sharply condemned the siege of Hama escalation on 1 August 2011, saying the Syrian government's use of heavy weapons against the general populace \\"has given me a deep shock\\". G√ºl said it was \\"impossible to remain silent in the face of events visible to everyone ... and accept a bloody atmosphere at the start of Ramadan\\". He called upon the Syrian government to stop the violence and institute reforms to restore \\"peace and stability\\". On 21 March 2011, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu said, \\"Syria is on an important threshold. We hope problems between the people and the administration [in Syria] can be handled without trouble.\\" On 2 May 2011, Erdoƒüan warned that if the Syrian government replicated an incident like the Hama massacre during this uprising, Turkey would not stand idly by. On 10 June 2011, Erdoƒüan condemned Assad outright, calling the images of security forces attacking Syrian protesters \\"unpalatable\\" and criticizing the \\"savagery\\" of the government's response to the uprising. He said Turkey may back a proposed Security Council resolution condemning the Syrian government. Although on 5 August 2011, Davutoƒülu said his government was not considering expelling the Syrian ambassador to Turkey, he visited Syria on 9 August 2011 to deliver a \\"decisive message\\". After meeting with Assad and other Syrian officials for over six hours, Davutoƒülu said he had outlined \\"concrete steps\\" that the Syrian government should take, but he did not say how they responded. Reports indicated that he had delivered an ultimatum from Turkey's president to Syria's president. The Turkish government was allegedly concerned about Syrian ties to Iran and the role both have historically played in destabilising Iraq, as well as the possible sectarian dynamic of the conflict. On 15 August 2011, Davutoƒülu warned that the violence must stop \\"immediately and without conditions or excuses\\" or Turkey would take unspecified \\"steps\\". G√ºl expressed disappointment in the government on 28 August and said his government had \\"lost confidence\\" in Assad. Turkey stopped at least two shipments of what it said were Iranian weapons en route to Syria, one in March 2011 and one in early August 2011. On 22 November, Erdoƒüan said that Assad should learn from the fate of Muammar Gaddafi. Erdogan said that \\"Assad is showing up and saying he would fight to the death. For God's Sake, against whom will you fight? Fighting against your own people is not heroism, but cowardice. If you want to see someone who has fought until death against his own people, just look at Nazi Germany, just look at Hitler, at Benito Mussolini, at Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania,\\" and \\"If you cannot draw any lessons from them, then look at the Libyan leader who was killed just 32 days ago in a manner none of us would wish for and who used the same expression you used.\\" On 10 April 2012, Erdoƒüan slammed the Syrian government saying, \\"they are even shooting these fleeing people from behind. They are mercilessly shooting them, regardless of whether they are children or women.\\" and added \\"Indeed, he(Assad) gave his word to Mr. Annan, but despite giving his word he is continuing to kill 60, 70, 80, 100 every day. This is the situation.\\" Erdoƒüan began trying to \\"cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad.\\" On 7 October 2013, Erdogan called Assad a terrorist, he said \\"I don't regard Bashar Assad as a politician anymore. He's a terrorist carrying out state terrorism. A person who killed 110,000 of his people is a terrorist. There's state terrorism ‚Äî I'm speaking frankly.\\" By October 2013, more than 500,000 Syrian refugees had fled to Turkey. = United States =  2011  = March‚ÄìApril 2011 = President Barack Obama's administration on 18 March 2011 condemned the use of violence, stating: \\"The United States stands for a set of universal rights, including the freedom of expression and assembly, and believes that governments, including the Syrian government, must address the legitimate aspirations of their people.\\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that it was unlikely the US would intervene in Syria, since the US Congress viewed al-Assad as \\"a reformer\\". On 9 April, it was reported that Obama had said: \\"I strongly condemn the abhorrent violence committed against peaceful protesters by the Syrian government today and over the past few weeks. I also condemn any use of violence by protesters ... I call upon the Syrian authorities to refrain from any further violence against peaceful protesters ... Furthermore, the arbitrary arrests, detention, and torture of prisoners that has been reported must end now, and the free flow of information must be permitted so that there can be independent verification of events on the ground...Violence and detention are not the answer to the grievances of the Syrian people. It is time for the Syrian government to stop repressing its citizens, and to listen to the voices of the Syrian people calling for meaningful political and economic reforms.\\"  May 2011  On 18 May Obama imposed sanctions on Assad and six other senior Syrian officials. Additional sanctions were imposed by the Treasury Department against Syrian and Iranian intelligence services and commanders.\\"U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Syrian Leader and 6 Aides\\", The New York Times, accessed 18 May 2011 On 20 May, the U.S. told Assad to reform or step down.Syrian forces kill 30 protesters, iolNews (Independent Online (South Africa)), 21 May 2011. Retrieved 6 March 2014.  July 2011  Clinton condemned on 12 July both the attacks and the incumbent government, stating that al-Assad had \\"lost legitimacy\\", and that \\"President Assad is not indispensable and we have absolutely nothing invested in him remaining in power.\\" Robert Stephen Ford, the US ambassador to Syria, criticised the government on the embassy's Facebook page, stating: \\"On July 9, a 'mnhebak' group threw rocks at our embassy, causing some damage. They resorted to violence, unlike the people in Hama, who have stayed peaceful... and how ironic that the Syrian Government lets an anti-US demonstration proceed freely while their security thugs beat down olive branch-carrying peaceful protesters elsewhere.\\"Al Jazeera Syria Live Blog, Monday, July 11, 2011 - 20:33 entry On 31 July responding to a pre-Ramadan crackdown, the bloodiest day of the uprising to date, Obama sharply condemned the violence, warning that Assad was \\"on the wrong side of history and his people\\", and added, \\"Through his own actions, Bashar al-Assad is ensuring that he and his government will be left in the past, and that the courageous Syrian people who have demonstrated in the streets will determine its future. Syria will be a better place when a democratic transition goes forward.\\" While he did not explicitly demand that Assad resign, he said the US would step up its efforts on the international stage to \\"isolate the Assad government and stand with the Syrian people\\". = August 2011 = The U.S. government slapped a new round of economic sanctions on Syrian telecom companies and banks tied to Damascus on 10 August. The sanctions rendered U.S. citizens unable to do business with the Commercial Bank of Syria, the Syrian Lebanese Commercial Bank, or Syriatel, and froze the U.S.-based assets of those companies. United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice said that testimonials from Syrian protesters as reported by Ford were shaping Washington's policies on Syria. \\"What [Ford] hears every day and what [the protesters] want from the United States is more leadership, political pressure, and sanctions, but very clearly no military intervention\\", she said. In a written statement issued on 18 August, Obama said explicitly for the first time that Assad should resign: \\"The future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way ... For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.\\" He again condemned the violent crackdown, but reiterated that the US would not intervene in Syria's affairs beyond placing political and economic pressure on Assad to leave power. Both the E.U. and Canada joined U.S. calls for regime change. He also issued an executive order that \\"blocks the property of the Syrian government, bans US persons from new investments in or exporting services to Syria, and bans US imports of, and other transactions or dealings in, Syrian-origin petroleum or petroleum products.\\" The same day, Clinton announced a full ban on imports of Syrian oil or petroleum products into the United States. On 23 August U.S. ambassador Robert Ford made a surprise tour of the town of Jassem, which had seen government crackdown after popular protests. The Assad government denounced the visit as \\"inciting unrest\\" and banned Western diplomats from departing from Damascus; the U.S. embassy was attacked by a pro-Assad mob that broke windows and sprayed graffiti. On 26 August the media reported that then-U.S. Central Intelligence Agency chief Leon Panetta traveled to Turkey in March 2011 to discuss regime change. = November 2011 = On 23 November the U.S. Embassy in Damascus issued a call for American nationals to leave Syria \\"immediately while commercial transportation is available.\\" On 24 November the U.S. Navy's Carrier Strike Group Two was operating off the coast of Syria to monitor the uprising. An unnamed Western diplomat in the region noting: \\"It is probably routine movement. But it is going to put psychological pressure on the regime, and the Americans don't mind that.\\"  2012  On 24 February after a veto by Russia and China of an Arab League-backed initiative, Clinton blasted Russia and China saying, \\"It's quite distressing to see two permanent members of the Security Council using their veto while people are being murdered ‚Äî women, children, brave young men... It is just despicable and I ask whose side are they on? They are clearly not on the side of the Syrian people.\\" On 20 August, Obama warned that the use of chemical weapons in Syria by President Bashar al- Assad would be a \\"red line\\" for America and would change Obama's views on intervening in the conflict. Obama said that the consequences of using these weapons would be enormous, and their deployment would widen the conflict in the region, and would concern America's allies as well.  2013  On 13 June the Obama administration said that it would begin shipping small arms to Syrian rebels to help them topple the government. Administration officials \\"cited clear evidence that the Syrian government had at different times used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, killing as many as 150 people and thus had crossed Obama's 'red line'. Officials confirmed the Central Intelligence Agency would coordinate all direct military assistance to the Syrian rebels.\\" In a speech on 31 August, Obama asked the United States Congress to authorize direct American military intervention. The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations approved the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against the Government of Syria to Respond to Use of Chemical Weapons (S.J.Res 21) on 4 September 2013. If passed, the bill would allow the President to take direct action for up to 90 days; it specifically forbids putting \\"boots on the ground.\\" On 3 November, Secretary of State John Kerry said in Cairo that a handover of power by Syrian President Assad \\"can give the people of Syria the opportunity to choose their future\\".Future of Syria peace talks in question, Aljazeera, 4 November 2013.

On 2 October American Vice President Joe Biden said that \\"[The Turks ... the Saudis, the Emiratis] poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad ‚Äî except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and al-Qaida and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world\\", and also said that Turkish President Erdogan had admitted to him that Turkey had by mistake allowed foreign fighters to cross into Syria. Erdogan denied that, and demanded Biden's apologies, which Biden conceded on 4 October: Biden phoned with Erdogan that day, and a White House spokesman said that Biden hadn't meant to imply that Turkey had intentionally supplied or facilitated ISIL or any extremist group in Syria.\\"Biden apologizes to Turkey president in phone call\\". The Washington Post. 4 October 2014. = United Kingdom = On 24 March 2011, Foreign Secretary William Hague said: \\"We call on the government of Syria to respect their people's right to peaceful protest, and to take action about their legitimate grievances.\\" On 10 August, after Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar Jaafari compared the protests in Syria to the actions of rioters in England, British Permanent Representative to the United Nations Mark Lyall Grant ridiculed the comparison, saying, \\"In the United Kingdom, you have a situation where the government is taking measured, proportionate, legal, transparent steps to ensure the rule of law for its citizens. In Syria, you have a situation where thousands of unarmed civilians are being attacked and many of them killed.\\" Cameron, together with French Sarkozy and Merkel, demanded Assad step down in an 18 August 2011 joint statement, which also condemned the crackdown and called for an end to violence. In a press conference on 18 June 2013, the British Prime Minister Cameron said it would be \\"unthinkable\\" for Bashar al-Assad to be part of any future government in Syria. On 29 August 2013, the British parliament refused to support the British government's plan to participate in military strikes against the Syrian government in the wake of a chemical-weapons attack at Ghouta. In January 2014, 16 people were arrested in a crackdown on Britons travelling to or from Syria or Middle Eastern training camps for fighters. Police stated \\"Our biggest concern is people attending terrorist training camps or fighting in war zones then returning to the UK as terrorists.\\" = A ‚Äì C =  Abkhazia  The government of Abkhazia supports Syria in its \\"war on terrorism\\". In 2015, the Abkhaz Foreign Minister met Syrian Ambassador to Russia, Riyad Haddad, in Moscow and afterwards said that his government believes Syria will recognize the former Georgian republic of Abkhazia's independence as a sovereign country in the future. In November 2016, President of Abkhazia Raul Khajimba stressed his country's support to Syria in its \\"war against international terrorism\\". On the same occasion, Khajimba called Syria a \\"sisterly country\\". Nonetheless, Abkhazia supports the re-migration of Syrian citizens of Abkhaz descent back into Abkhazia. In the first five years of the Civil War, about 500 Syrians remigrated to Abkhazia. In December 2015, the Foreign Minister of Abkhazia met with Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Syrian Arab Republic in Russia Riyad Haddad and they discussed the remigration of Syrian citizens of Abkhaz descent. In 2017, Abkhazia send humanitarian aid to Syria. In 2018, Syria recognised the independence of Abkhazia.  Albania  During a meeting with the new ambassador of Qatar in Albania, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said: \\"The government of Albania is following with concern the events in Syria where the government of Bashar al-Assad is using its power as a permit to kill the innocent civilians and the Syrian people.\\"PM Berisha receives new ambassador of State of Qatar Yossef Bin Hassan Bin Yousef Al Saai, Council of Ministers of the Republic of Albania, 2012-02-14 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 18 February 2012 strongly condemned the violence.Statement of Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval of the Resolution for Syria in the General Assembly of UN, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania, 2012-02-18 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported the conclusions of the 27 February meeting of the European Union, as well as the European Union sanctions.Albania joins the International Group of ‚ÄúFriends of Syria‚Äù, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania, 2012-02-28 During the meeting on 1 April 2012, Friends of Syria in Istanbul the Minister of foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania, Edmond Haxhinasto said that the issue of human rights is a responsibility of the international community. He expressed the need to intensify the pressure against the current government of Damascus not just politically, but also through a concentrated action of all international mechanisms. Haxhinasto stressed the position of the Albanian Government to support the efforts of the UN, the EU, the Arab League and other international bodies in putting an end to the violence towards the civilian population from the Damascus government, and establishing the conditions for a democratic process. He praised the Mission of the UN Special Envoy, Mr. Kofi Annan and his plan to stop the bloodshed and violence, achieve national reconciliation and establish a democratic government in Syria. In conclusion, Minister Haxhinasto underlined the support of the Albanian Government for the Syrian democratic opposition represented by the Syrian National Council, as well as its war for freedom, human dignity and progress.  Algeria  On November 23, 2011, the Algerian Foreign Ministry spokesman Amar Bellani, said his country urged Damascus \\"to sign the protocol on sending Arab observers to Syria to avoid the internationalization of the crisis,\\" referring to a possible initiative from countries outside the Arab world, in a statement broadcast by the agency APS.Argelia insta a Siria a aceptar env√≠o de observadores de Liga √Årabe Consultado el 23 de noviembre de 2011 In March 2020 Algeria, due to host a summit of the Arab League, stated that the event must herald a return of Syria to the organization, asserting that Syria's expulsion from the League was \\"a historical mistake committed in one of the worst stages of the Arab collapse.\\"  Armenia  Estimations of Armenians living in Syria before the war were up to 100,000, majority of them in Aleppo. In 2014 the Armenian government stated that they would not interfere in the Syrian Civil War and maintained a neutral stance. Jihadist groups taking over Syrian locations, through Turkey, with Armenian civilians has concerned the government. Armenia in 2012 and in 2016 sent humanitarian aid for the Syrian government. Armenian government showed support for Russia when attack plane was shot down. In February 2019 Armenia sent a non-combat mission to Syria as part of the Russian mission.

Former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair said on 9 June 2011 that \\"change in Syria is essential\\", although he warned of a power vacuum in the event of regime change. \\"It is important we get to the point where the Syrian people are able to elect their government\\", Blair said. He said he hoped Assad would make the necessary reforms, but acknowledged that the majority opinion among protesters in Syria was that Assad must leave power. The mufti of Mount Lebanon Governorate in Lebanon, Sheikh Mohammad Ali Jouzou on 21 July 2011, said that the Syrian security apparatus was being turned \\"against the struggling people\\" and criticised government violence. He voiced support for Qatar's role in supporting the Arab Spring, including its withdrawal of its ambassador. Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, imam of al-Azhar, Cairo's oldest mosque, said the institution \\"was patient for a long time and avoided talking about the situation in Syria because of its sensitive nature\\", but by 8 August 2011, it had \\"exceeded all limits\\". He called for an end to the \\"tragedy\\". Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who resigned in the face of similar protests in February 2011 and was facing trial for his role in attempting to suppress demonstrations, condemned \\"crimes perpetrated by the Syrian regime against their own people\\" and urged Assad to resign. After a bloody crackdown across Syria, former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri publicly condemned the Syrian government. \\"We in Lebanon cannot, under any circumstances, remain silent regarding the bloody developments taking place in Syria.\\" He compared the violence in Hama to the 1982 Hama massacre and said the Arab world must speak out. Political analyst Karim Sader suggested Qatar's response was part of \\"a shrewdly calculated divorce from the Syrian regime\\". Qatar News Agency, the emirate's state-owned media outlet, was the first network in the Arab world to broadcast Arab League Secretary-General Naril Elaraby's 7 August statement criticizing the Syrian government over its military actions and calling for an end to the violence. In 2012, tripartite president during the Bosnian War, Ejup Ganiƒá, said that the same mistakes were being made in Syria. \\"The world swallowed the pill in Bosnia, where it became normal to hit apartments people live in and to burn cities randomly. The international community allowed a crime against humanity in Bosnia. The same is happening in Syria. [The United States] should react [because it is] a superpower with human rights on the agenda. As this is the year of the United States presidential election, 2012, Unfortunately, there's a lack of leadership in the world when it comes to right versus wrong.\\" Al Jazeera's Beirut-based reporter Ali Hashem resigned after his e-mails expressing frustration at the outlet's \\"unprofessional\\" and biased coverage of the Syrian civil war, which relegated the 2011-2012 Bahraini uprising to smaller stories despite more daily events including violence, deaths and judicial motions. American politician Dick Black, contrary to his own country's official stance on Syria, sent a letter to Bashar al-Assad praising his conduct in the war, saying that the Syrian army deserved credit for a \\"heroic rescue of Christians\\", defending Jews in Syria, and \\"exhibit[ing] extraordinary gallantry in the war against terrorists\\". = Solidarity protests = On 5 August 2012, in Australia, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Sydney during a pro-government rally, chanting slogans in English and Arabic in support of President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian Arab Army. The protesters blamed the media for distorting the situation in Syria and bias in favour of the opposition.

Observations In the preamble of the resolution, Council members welcomed the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement by the Sudanese government and Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M) and urged the parties to meet their obligations under that agreement. It acknowledged the commitments of troop-contributing countries in support of UNMIS. The resolution reiterated the need to put an end to violence and atrocities in Darfur, emphasising the need to conclude a peace agreement as soon as possible. It welcomed the African Union's Peace and Security Council decision to support a transition from the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to a United Nations operation. Calling the situation in Sudan a \\"threat to international peace and security\\", the Council also expressed concern at the movement of weapons and armed groups across borders, including the long- running insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the implications on Sudanese civilians. Acts The mandate of UNMIS was extended with an intention for further renewals if necessary. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to report every three months on the situation, including efforts by UNMIS to support the AMIS. In this context, UNMIS was asked to support AMIS in accordance with Resolution 1590 (2005). Meanwhile, the Secretary-General and African Union were called upon to begin preparations for a United Nations mission in Darfur. The Council also condemned the activities of militia and armed groups such as the LRA which continued to attack civilians and commit human rights abuses in Sudan; it anticipated recommendations from the Secretary-General on how best to deal with the issue.

The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care. Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems. Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity). As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems. Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint. BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients‚Äô changing needsRobinson, P.J. and Reiter, J.T. (2007). Behavioral Consultation and Primary Care (pp 1-16). N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media. In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably.  Associated Terms  Primary Care Psychology: Provision of clinical mental health services through a population-based focus on the common problems confronting a majority of individuals. Such issues treated in primary care may include response to physical illness, stress, affective concerns, substance use and abuse, and developmental and situational issues among others. Primary care psychologists are co-located with primary care providers and usually share the same physical space in practice. Primary care psychologists may retain the traditional session length of specialty care or may adhere to a brief, consultative approach that is solution-focused. Primary Care Psychologists may often be trained in health psychology programs, but not exclusively so. Behavioral Health Consultant: Behavioral Health Consultants and Primary Care Physicians collaborate within the same system. The behavioral health provider works as part of the medical team to meet the wide range of needs with which patients present.Hunter, C.L., Goodie, J.L., Oordt, M.S., & Dobmeyer A.C., (2009), Integrated behavioral health in primary care: Step-by-step guidance for assessment and intervention. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Collaborative Care: This model uses databases or what are known as registries to track and monitor patients with certain conditions. Typical examples in primary care include diabetes and depression. Often the person managing the registry is a nurse or mental health professional who performs follow-up phone calls and assists the primary care team in following evidence- based protocols. There is often also a consulting psychiatrist who oversees the provision of care in primary care. Rationale Primary care has often been termed the \\"De Facto\\" mental health system in the United States.Cummings, N.A., O‚ÄôDonohue, W., Hays, S.C., & Follette, V. (2001). Integrated behavioral healthcare: Positioning mental health practice with medical/surgical practice. San Diego: Academic Press. Research shows that approximately half of all mental health care services are provided solely by primary care providers. Furthermore, primary care practitioners prescribe about 70% of all psychotropic medications and 80% of antidepressants. Thus, while it seems there are various \\"specialty\\" mental health clinics and psychiatrists alike, the primary care environment continues to lend itself to an array of psychiatric issues. One reason is that physical health problems can contribute to psychological dysfunction and vice versa. Examples of the frequent comorbity between medical and psychological problems include: chronic pain can cause depression; panic symptoms can lead to complaints of heart palpitations; and stress can contribute to irritable bowl syndrome.O‚ÄôDonohue, W.T., Cummings, N.A., Cucciare, M.A., Runyan, C.N., & Cummings, J.L. (2006). Integrated behavioral health care: A guide to effective intervention. Amherst, NY: Humanities Books. While these mind-body relationships may seem obvious, often the presenting problem is far less clear, with the physical health problem being masked by psychosocial concerns. In fact, of the 10 most common complaints in primary care, less than 16% had a diagnosable physical etiology. The psychosocial impact on primary care is tremendous (approximately 70% of all visits); however, it is curious that few mental health providers have traditionally placed themselves where the demand for their services is arguably the greatest. Despite the availability of outpatient mental health resources, research indicates that patients are still driven to the primary care setting. In fact, studies show that as little as 10% of patients actually follow through when being referred by a physician to receive outpatient mental health treatment.Slay, J.D., & McCleod, C. (1997) Evolving an integration model: The Healthcare Partners experience. In N.A. Cummings, J.L. Cummings, and J. Johnson (Eds.) Behavioral health in primary care: A guide for clinical integration (pp 121-144). New York: International Universities Press. Many experts believe this low completion rate is tied to the stigma that often surrounds mental health care, causing patients to deny or refuse to seek help for psychiatric needs. As a general rule, patients who do choose to address their mental health concerns express a preference for services in primary care likely due to its familiarity and less stigmatizing environment. However, as many medical providers will admit, their training has left them ill-prepared to appropriately treat the psychiatric sequalae that presents in their clinic. The PCBH model has sought to address this dilemma by providing access to mental health services on site to more effectively target the biological, psychological, and social aspects of patient care. Resulting from close collaboration between physicians and mental health providers, the patients‚Äô needs are more adequately met by care that is more comprehensive and collaborative between physicians and mental health providers. Furthermore, the patients are more likely to follow through with primary care services, with referral rates around 80-90%. The Behavioral Health Consultant Model Behavioral Health Consultants are culturally competent generalists who provide treatment for a wide variety of mental health, psychosocial, motivational, and medical concerns, including management of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, and diabetes among others. BHCs also provide support and management for patients with severe and persistent mental illness and tend to be familiar with psychopharmacological interventions. Paralleling general medicine, patients who require more extensive mental health treatment are typically referred to specialty care. BHC appointments are typically 15‚Äì30 minutes long with the goal of utilizing brief interventions to reduce functional impairment for the population as a whole. BHCs tend to provide focused feedback to PCPs with succinct, action oriented recommendations to help effectively manage patients‚Äô needs. BHC interventions tend to be more cost effectiveJames, L.C. (2009) What administrators should know about the primary care setting. In L.C. James & W.T. O‚ÄôDonohue (Eds.). The primary care toolkit (pp 13-19). N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media and offer increased access to care, with improved patient and provider satisfaction. =Evidence Base For The BHC Model= A comparison of an enhanced-referral system to a BHC model found that more than 80% of medical providers rated communication between themselves and the BHC as occurring \\"frequently,\\" relative to less than 50% in an enhanced-referral model of care. Providers strongly preferred an integrated care model to the enhanced-referral model. Another single-site study at an urban community health center found that embedding BHCs resulted in reduced referrals to specialty mental health (8% of depressed patients were referred) along with improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the care of depression and reduced prescriptions for antidepressants. Moreover, a recent literature review revealed that improved outcomes in mental health care were associated with several fundamental characteristics, including collaboration and co-location with PCP and mental health providers, as well as systematic follow-up, medication compliance, patient psycho-education, and patient input into treatment modality. In general the number of empirical investigations that have examined the clinical impact and cost-offset of the BHC model is still limited, although a growing body of evidence supports the utility of other integrated behavior health programs (with varying degrees of integration) in academic settings, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and community health care settings. A 2011 Cochrane review found that counselling in primary care settings resulted in significantly greater clinical effectiveness in short term mental health outcomes compared to usual care but provided no longer term benefits. Since all of the studies reviewed were from the United Kingdom how well these findings can be generalized to other settings is unknown. Depression Care Specifically targeting depression, Schulberg, Raue, & Rollman (2002) reviewed 12 randomized controlled trials (RCT's) that examined evidence-based treatments for major depression (interpersonal psychotherapy & cognitive-behavior therapy) and problem-solving therapy, compared to usual care by PCP's (i.e. antidepressant medication, drug placebo, or unspecified control). The authors concluded that evidence-based psychotherapies adapted for the primary care setting are comparable to pharmacotherapy alone and superior to PCP's usual care. The use of brief evidence-based psychotherapies, such as those reviewed by Schulberg et al., 2002, are fundamental within the PCBH model. The PCBH model emphasizes a problem-focused and functional- contextual approach to assessment and treatment of behavioral health and mental disorders. Wolf and Hopko's (2008) recent review of treatments for depression in primary care concluded that adaptations of CBT for depression in primary care are \\"probably efficacious.\\" Research also shows that providing basic training in CBT to PCPs is not enough to produce robust clinical outcomes (King et al., 2002); highlighting the importance of the BHC's integrated role in primary care. With respect to the impact of behavioral health consultation on pharmacological treatment of major and minor depression, compared to usual care Katon et al. (1995) found improved medication adherence, increased patient satisfaction with treatment, and overall greater improvements in mood over time for major depression. Inclusion of a behavioral health professional in the treatment of depression in primary care improves outcomes, patient and physician satisfaction, and costs less than usual care.Blount, A. (1998). Integrated Primary Care: the Future of Medical and Mental Health Collaboration. New York: Norton. The PCBH model prioritizes the usage of treatment algorithms based on scientific guidelines that include pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. This approach seeks to ensure that patients receive the safest and most effective treatments available. Anxiety Care Although less empirical attention has been directed toward improving treatment of anxiety disorders in primary care, Stanley et al. found 8 sessions of CBT delivered in a co-located model, superior to usual care for generalized anxiety disorder. Additionally, a collaborative care approach that packaged brief CBT with pharmacotherapy reduced disability, increased remitted symptoms, and decreased anxiety sensitivity for individuals diagnosed with panic disorder relative to usual care and demonstrated greater improvement in depression, anxiety, and disability measures at 6 month follow-up,. Further, clinical guidelines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in primary care recommend behavior therapy and/or SSRI.National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. (2001). Generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) in adults: management in primary, secondary and community care. (Clinical guideline 113.). Available from NICE http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG113. Health Behavior Change In regard to other health behaviors, strict utilization of the BHC model has shown significant improvements in sleep difficulties, while less integrated models of behavioral health have produced favorable outcomes for smoking cessation,Fiore, M., Bailey, W., Cohen, S., et al. (2000). Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. A Clinical Practice Guideline. Rockville, MD: U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services; AHRQ publication No. 00-0032. diabetes adherence, and pain disorders.Ahles, T., Wasson, J., Seville, J. L., Johnson, D. J., Cole, B. F., Hanscom, B., et al. (2006). A controlled trial of methods for managing pain with or without co-occurring psychological problems. Annals of Family Medicine, 3, 1‚Äì13. Whitlock et al., suggest brief behavioral interventions have only a modest impact on health behavior change. However, they also suggested that within a population-based model of care modest changes in behavioral health \\"translate to significant effects.\\" Alternative Models Of Care Traditional Outpatient Psychotherapy: Commonly called \\"Specialty\\" care, traditional outpatient psychotherapy usually involves treatment of mental health concerns in an outpatient clinic or another setting independent of medical care. Sessions are usually 50 minutes in length and the duration of treatment may vary from weeks to years depending on the mental health concern. Typically, little contact occurs between therapists and patients‚Äô physicians or psychiatrists, and coordination of care may be difficult, time consuming, and expensive. The payment and access systems for specialty mental health are also usually distinct from and more cumbersome than that for primary care treatment. Co-located Care Model: Behavioral health providers and PCPs practice within the same office or building but maintain separate care delivery systems, including records and treatment plans. However, behavioral health providers and PCPs may consult one another for enhanced treatment outcomes. Policy Funding has been a barrier to the implementation of the Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultant model. The cost of treatment and lack of affordable health care has been a barrier for many people with mental illness to receive treatment. In the private sector insurance market mental health treatment is often segregated from other medical care, isolated in separate systems of care and payment. Typically this makes it more difficult for patients to access services readily, if at all. For uninsured patients the United States federal government can provide (depending on eligibility criteria) Medicaid which provides insurance coverage for a large number of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness. The federal government provides money to each state to fund Medicaid programs and provides general mandates on how the money must be spent. Because the federal government has special relationships with Veteran's Administration hospitals and clinics and federally qualified health centers and because several federal agencies have identified integrated care as key targets for improved primary care, the PCBH model has been able to take root in these systems whereas only a few PCBH programs exist in private insurance environments. One major barrier in some states (states can set some of their own rules with regard to Medicaid) is the prohibition of same-day billing. This makes it impossible for a PCBH program since the fundamental concept behind PCBH is the provision of services (medical and mental health visit) on the same day. Typically eligible professionals for Medicaid reimbursement in federally qualified health centers include psychiatrists, psychologists and licensed clinical social workers. Access to care and payment tends to be less restrictive with Medicare, another federal program for persons without private insurance. The other major issue impacting the development of the PCBH model is the dearth of well-trained mental health workers. At present professional training programs with an emphasis in primary care are limited in number which has led to the growth of internships of varying kinds to train students and retrain professionals (see training programs below). =PCBH and Health Disparities In The United States= As the population of the United States becomes more diverse, the approach to population-based care must also adjust accordingly. Projections published by the U.S. Census Bureau estimate that by the year 2042 White, non-Hispanic people will no longer be the majority of the population in the United States.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2001). Mental health: Culture, race, ethnicity. Retrieved November 14, 2008, from http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov /cre/toc.asp According to the 2010 census, White, non-Hispanic people are no longer the majority of the population in Texas, California, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, and New Mexico.Humes, K.R., Jones, N.A., & Ramirez, R.R. (2011, March). Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 [Census brief]. Retrieved from: https://www.census.gov/ prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf The changing population of the United States is generating a need to incorporate cultural competence into the way primary care services are delivered. These changes in the population are concurrent with increasing evidence of disparities in the quality of care that is provided to historically underserved populations within the United States. Underserved populations have low levels of access and utilization based on economic, cultural, and systemic barriers to care. Behavioral Health providers in Primary Care settings have an opportunity to directly impact health care disparities by designing \\"‚Ä¶strategies to enhance cooperative or healthy behavior\\". \\"The premise is that mismatches in models (i.e., expectations about illness and health interactions) between the patient and the health provider may render medical care ‚Äòpsychologically‚Äô inaccessible to ethnic minorities, resulting in poorer health outcomes for these populations (possibly via noncompliance).\\"Armstrong, T., & Swartzman, L. (2001), Cross-cultural differences in illness models and expectations for the health care provider- client/patient interaction. In S. Kazarian and D. Evans (Eds.), Cultural health psychology, (pp. 45-61). San Diego, CA: Academic Press. Strategies that help bridge mismatches improve treatment outcomes and make care more accessible for underserved populations. By establishing a role in primary care, the front-line of health-care delivery, Behavioral Health providers gain direct access to patients and providers. Healthy People 2010, published in 2007, recommended \\"that early intervention efforts to protect and promote mental health, including screening and the promotion of mental health awareness, become an essential component of primary care visits and school health assessments.\\".Wright, D., (2007).

Retrieved March 14, 2010, from http://www.healthypeople.gov/hp2020/objectives/TopicArea.aspx?id=34& TopicArea=Mental+Health+and+Mental+Disorders As Hass and deGruy point out, \\"The primary care patient may or may not believe that she has a mental problem, and may or may not be ready to agree to psychological treatment‚Ä¶primary care psychologists [must] make services accessible and understandable to patients‚Ä¶\\".Haas, L.J., & deGruy, F.V. (2004). Primary care, psychology, and primary care psychology. In Haas, L.J. (Ed.), Handbook of Primary Care Psychology, (pp. 5-19). New York: Oxford University Press. Because of the difference in how patients, particularly those from underserved groups, may express their distress and respond to the stigma of mental illness providing Behavioral Health services through primary care will likely make services more psychologically and physically accessible. Providing culturally- competent, population based care can difficult to conceptualize, particularly in the context of the fast-paced environment of primary care. Hunter et al. propose \\"a patient-centered, culturally competent approach for effective communication and care‚Ä¶that includes the Explanatory model of health and illness, Social and environmental factors affecting adherence, Fears and concerns about medication and side effects, Treatment understanding model of culturally competent practice\\". By adopting this kind of approach, Behavioral Health providers can help primary care providers meet the medical, psychological, and cultural needs of the patient. History In the early 1960s, Kaiser Permanente, an early Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), uncovered that 60% of physician visits were either individuals who were somatizing stress or whose physical condition was exacerbated by emotional factors. These findings prompted Kaiser to explore various strategies to better manage psychosocial complaints, with ultimate goal of cost reduction. Psychotherapy, which was offered as a prepaid benefit, was studied as a method to reduce primary care visits while also more properly (and less expensively) addressing the problem at hand. Studies revealed that by participating in brief psychotherapy, medical utilization reduced by 65%. The initiatives at Kaiser Permanent set in motion a large body of research on medical cost- offset, a term for the reduction in medical costs that occurs as a result of a patient receiving appropriately designed behavior health services in lieu of more expensive medical services. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded several replications examining medical cost offset in the years to follow, with reductions of cost around 30 to 65%.Jones, K.R., & Vischi, T.R. (1980). The Bethesda Consensus Conference on Medical Offset. Alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health administration report. Rockville, MD: Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration. One important trend that emerged in this literature was the greater the collaboration between primary care, the better the cost offset. Likewise, the more \\"traditional\\" the behavioral interventions, the less the medical cost offset. In 1981, The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) sponsored the Hawaii Medicaid Project, a seven-year prospective study examining the impact of a new, collaborative behavioral health system among 36,000 Medicaid beneficiaries and 91,000 federal employees in Honolulu. This landmark trial compared the medical cost- offset among patients who received brief and targeted interventions, those who received a 52-session annual psychotherapy benefit, and those who received no treatment. The results showed that the brief, targeted interventions reduced saved $350 per patient per year while psychotherapy actually increased costs by $750 per year. The Hawaii Medicaid Project became the prototype for cost offset research and spawned future projects among managed care organizations, with goal of reducing costs. In 1987, Humana followed suit by studying brief behavioral intervention among Medicare recipients in Florida, with the intention of reducing medical utilization among recent widows and widowers. Known as the Bereavement Program, Humana learned after 2 years $1400 could be saved per patient via brief group intervention for bereavement.Cummings, N.A. (1997). Approaches in prevention in the behavioral health of older adults. In P. Hartman-Stein (Eds.) Innovative behavioral healthcare for older adults: A guide-for changing times (pp. 1-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. In the 1990s, other HMOs and regional group practices began to integrate behavioral health services into primary care, including Kaiser Permanente, Healthcare partners, Group Health Cooperative of the Puget Sound, Kaiser Group Health of Minnesota, and Duke University Medical Center. In the years to follow, behavioral health integration started to gain support from a federal level, as VA systems began to conduct research around the impact of primary care psychologists, beginning with the Healthcare Network of Upstate New York (VISN2). In the last decade, additional VA systems have followed suit with primary care behavioral health programs of their own to meet the increasing mental health demands of soldiers returning from war. More recently, federal support has begun to take hold by increasing funding for integrated behavioral health services for various federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the United States. Primary care behavioral health was seen as a solution in FQHCs to address the mental health needs of the Medicaid and uninsured populations, with the goal of better treatment and reduced overall costs.

In August 1996, he attended the 22nd International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, as an artist delegate by invitation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The Congress, for the first time held outside of Europe, was considered to be a \\"historic meeting\\" for scientists and artists pursuing Heraldry in Modern Times. Wood as highly esteemed artist and lecturer was invited to attend the 23rd International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences in Turin, Italy, in September 1998, where he gave a paper on Heraldic Art and Design. Wood committed to teach his students a wide variety of techniques ranging from medieval to modern styles of calligraphy and illumination done mainly on calf and goatskin vellum, in gouache colours and precious metals, continued to work over the past half century to private commissions for clients from all over the world. His armorial art produced for the House of Lords, the House of Commons and the Craft and Merchant Guilds of the city of London, commissioned by local authorities, schools, universities, and private collectors executed to the highest standards is recognisable for the high complexity of composition, rich detail, and created almost 3-D visual effect . Publications Wood is a co- author of A European Armorial. The masterful samples of his art were included in The Art of Heraldry by Carl-Alexander von Volborth, published in 1987. A Dictionary of Heraldry (1987)‚Äîedited by Stephan Friar and illustrated by Anthony Wood along with John Ferguson (artist), became highly recommended as complex introduction to heraldry. The Arms of the Lord Francis Lovel and The Arms of the Worshipful Company of Fletchers painted by Wood were reproduced distinctively on front and back covers of the volume. He has written numerous articles on heraldic art and craft. He contributed an essay entitled \\"The Art of Heraldry\\" and a painting of John Brooke-Little‚Äôs coat of arms to the book Tribute to an Armourist, published in 2000 by The Heraldry Society in London, to commemorate Brooke-Little‚Äôs lifelong service. In 1996, Wood published a book titled Heraldic Art and Design. Distinctions and other work In 1995, Wood was made a Freeman of the City of London. From 1980‚Äì1982 and from 1983‚Äì1984, he was Master of the Worshipful Company of Bowyers (longbow makers) of London, which is one of the Mediaeval Craft Guilds of the City.

Biography Emily Kimbrough was born in Muncie, Indiana on October 23, 1899 and died February 10, 1989 at her home in Manhattan. In 1921 she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and went on a trip to Europe with her friend Cornelia Otis Skinner. The two friends co-authored the memoir Our Hearts Were Young and Gay based on their European adventures. The success of the book as a New York Times best seller led to Kimbrough and Skinner going to Hollywood to work on a script for the movie version. Kimbrough wrote about the experience in We Followed Our Hearts to Hollywood. Kimbrough's journalistic career included an editor post at Fashions of the Hour, managing editorship at the Ladies Home Journal and a host of articles in Country Life, House & Garden, Travel, Reader's Digest, Saturday Review of Literature, and Parents magazines. Kimbrough's Through Charley's Door (published 1952) is an autobiographical narrative of her experiences in Marshall Field's Advertising Bureau. Hired in November 1923 as the researcher and writer for the department store's quarterly catalog, Fashions of the Hour, Kimbrough was later promoted to editor of the publication. In 1926, she was recruited by Barton Curry with Ladies' Home Journal, and left Marshall Field's to become Ladies' Home Journal's fashion editor, a position she held until 1929. Between 1929 and 1952, Kimbrough was a freelance writer, with articles published in The New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly among others. In 1952, she joined WCBS Radio.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/11/obituaries/emily- kimbrough-90-magazine-editor-and-popular-author.html Bibliography *Our Hearts Were Young and Gay (with Cornelia Otis Skinner, 1942) *We Followed Our Hearts to Hollywood (1943) *How Dear to My Heart (1944) *It Gives Me Great Pleasure (1948) *The Innocents from Indiana (1950) *Through Charley's Door (1952) *Forty Plus and Fancy Free (1954) *So Near and Yet So Far (1955) *Water, Water, Everywhere (1956) *And a Right Good Crew (1958) *Pleasure by the Busload (1961) *Forever Old, Forever New (1964) *Floating Island (1968) *Now and Then (1972) *Time Enough (1974) *Better than Oceans (1976) Books adapted for television In 1950 The Girls, a short-lived television series based on her Our Hearts Were Young and Gay novel was telecast, with Mary Malone playing Kimbrough.

It lies directly east of the Hessville neighborhood of Hammond. Within Gary, it adjoins the neighborhoods of Brunswick, Tolleston and Black Oak. In 2000, Westside had a population of 6,153, which was 63.3% African-American and 31.9% white, with 10.1% Hispanic ethnicity. Much of the neighborhood's acreage is devoted to industrial and institutional uses, including a landfill. Westside's housing stock is concentrated in the northeast and southern areas. In 2000, its 2,340 housing units were 92% occupied and 60% owner-occupied. Most development in the area occurred after 1960, giving it a younger housing stock than most other Gary neighborhoods. In 2007, the neighborhood had the third highest housing values in Gary, behind Miller and Ambridge Mann. The 1964 comprehensive plan for Gary had designated the entire Westside area for industrial use, but \\"the area was invaded by speculators, who built isolated housing tracts\\". Construction continued into the 1970s, including some affordable housing projects. Westside and Miller were the only neighborhoods in Gary to increase population between 1970 and 1980, when Westside's population reached 6,368. However, crime soon became problematic; in 1984, when Westside was still largely middle-class, the Jewel supermarket serving the area closed because repeated thefts and robberies. Today, retail business in Westside is quite limited, except for a retail cluster near the Burr Street exit of the Borman Expressway, on the boundary between Westside and Black Oak. Westside has an elementary school and West Side High School. There is an 8-acre city park, Seberger Park, near the neighborhood's southwestern corner.

Alwan for the Arts strives to create a platform to reflect the artistic expressions and intellectual production of the regions and their diasporas and allow New Yorkers, both Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern, to enjoy the arts from that region of the world.  History  Since 1998, Alwan has facilitated direct interaction between the general public and artists and scholars from the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, thereby enriching cross-cultural encounters and dialogue. In 2003, this endeavor was institutionalized by the acquisition of 501(c)3, nonprofit status, and moving into Alwan‚Äôs current home, a loft-like space that lends itself to dance and music events as well as lectures. In the spring of 1998, two friends realized that the dispersed Middle Eastern and South Asian communities needed a place to connect creatively and intellectually with others of similar backgrounds, outside the confines of academia. This dialogue segued into the creation of Alwan. Originally, the organization facilitated exploration of the founder's passions for Arab cinema. The germination of Alwan started through the launch of a series of provocative film screenings in academic settings. These screenings eventually soon consolidated and expanded into a small film festival. In due course, this festival became Alwan‚Äôs annual New York Arab & South Asian Film Festival (NYASAFF), the largest such event outside of the Middle East. Alwan's programming quickly expanded beyond film to other cultural spheres, including lectures, book talks, music and dance performances, workshops, language, music, and dance classes. Alwan hosts several events per month, often several per week, covering various aspects of Middle Eastern art and academia. Its events have featured distinguished speakers such as Hamid Dabashi and Norman Finkelstein. Alwan has also served the Middle Eastern community as a meeting point for the organizers of new nonprofit groups such as Existence is Resistance, \\"an internationalist organization determined to promote non-violent resistance through cultural arts\\".  Headquarters/Location  Alwan for the Arts is based in lower Manhattan at 16 Beaver Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10004. Alwan frequently hosts events in its space which can be adapted for different types of programming from an open floor to row seating with a capacity of around 100 people.  Cultural programming and events  Alwan offers a variety of events and cultural programs that all revolve around the Arts linked to the Middle East. Past events have ranged from debka workshop classes to political panel discussions with world-renowned professors, as well as music concerts and book signings. = Film Festival = Alwan hosts an annual film festival, the New York Arab & South Asian Film Festival (NYASAFF), which shows the best in recent features and documentaries from the region = Classes = Alwan offers beginner and intermediate Arabic language classes as well as Middle Eastern dance and music workshops.

In it he argues that producers, executives and writers in the entertainment industry are using television to promote a socialist political agenda. Content As one part of the evidence, Shapiro presents statements from taped interviews made by celebrities and TV show creators from Hollywood whom he interviewed for the book. The book include quotes from, among others, the co-creator of Friends, Marta Kauffman, and the creator of Soap and the Golden Girls, Susan Harris. Another argument is that conservatives are shunned in the industry. For example, Vin Di Bona, a producer responsible for many hit television shows, agreed during an interview with Shapiro that Hollywood promotes a liberal political agenda, commenting, \\"I'm happy about it, actually.\\" Di Bona also said that MacGyver, the cult hit show on which he was a producer, promoted an anti-gun movement position, as the character of MacGyver does not use a gun, but rather his own intelligence. People involved with television shows M*A*S*H and Happy Days told Shapiro that they possessed pacifistic and anti-Vietnam War agendas. Another example is the television show Sesame Street which is accused of deliberately spreading left-wing propaganda to children. Producer Leonard Goldberg stated to Shapiro that in the industry liberalism is \\"100 percent dominant, and anyone who denies it is kidding, or not telling the truth\\", and when Shapiro asked if politics are a barrier to entry replied, \\"Absolutely\\". Producer and director Nicholas Meyer replied \\"Well, I hope so,\\" when asked if conservatives are discriminated against, and stated regarding the 1983 made-for-TV film The Day After that, \\"My private, grandiose notion was that this movie would unseat Ronald Reagan when he ran for re-election.\\" Executive Fred Silverman stated regarding TV comedy nowadays that \\"...there‚Äôs only one perspective, and it‚Äôs a very progressive perspective. And if you want the other perspective... well it's just not there right now.\\" TV series COPS creator John Langley stated that he prefers showing segments where whites are the criminals because he fears that he would be promoting negative stereotypes.Paul Bond, \\"TV Executives Admit in Taped Interviews That Hollywood Pushes a Liberal Agenda\\" (Exclusive Video), June 1, 2011, The Hollywood Reporter Shapiro states that he was \\"...shocked by the openness of the Hollywood crowd when it came to admitting anti-conservative discrimination inside the industry\\". He argues that nepotism in Hollywood rarely is familial, but rather is ideological by friends hiring friends with the same ideological views: \\"The same people who talk about tolerance and diversity have no tolerance for ideological diversity.\\" He also states: \\"...the liberal content we see on primetime television and in daytime soaps is typically hidden in plot and character...I go through probably 100 shows in detail in Primetime Propaganda ‚Äì and virtually all of them are messaged, either blatantly or subtly.\\" Portions of some of the interviews which were released onto the internet to promote the book, particularly the Di Bona interview, caused director and producer Lionel Chetwynd to resign from the Caucus for Producers, Writers & Directors. In an open letter, he wrote about the reaction of other members of the caucus to Republican Party politicians: \\"In preparing his book, Mr. Shapiro interviewed a large number of our Hollywood notables on the subject of diversity -- not the sacrosanct melange of race, religion, gender orientation and the like, but a more challenging diversity: that of opinion and policy. The vast majority felt quite comfortable endorsing discrimination against those whose political philosophy was not rooted in the reflexive Leftism of Hollywood,\\" and \\"I knew most of my fellow members looked upon the political positions of these people as distasteful; what I now understand is the disgust was not for their views, but for their very person\\". Another argument by Shapiro is that Hollywood has overemphasized the importance of the 18‚Äì49-year-old market for advertisers. Initially, as admitted by executives during the taped interviews, this view was promoted by ABC in the late 1960s since the network had poor ratings and needed to increase advertising revenue in some way. Shapiro argues that the situation may change quickly in the future since new technologies, such as content delivered by the Internet, may dramatically change the media landscape.Carol A. Taber, \\"Primetime Propaganda\\", June 2, 2011, American Thinker =Interview techniques= Shapiro explained how he was able to interview numerous celebrities for the book: \\"I...told them I was profiling the biggest names in Hollywood over the last 50 years...They must have assumed that with a name like Shapiro and a Harvard Law credential, there was no need to Google; I would have to be a leftist. When I spoke with them, I used certain liberal code words ‚Äì 'social justice,' 'tolerance,' 'diversity.' And they spoke freely with me, with permission to tape.\\" Vin Di Bona stood by the statements quoted from his interview but added that the material \\"was obtained in a duplicitous manner\\", accusing Shapiro of misrepresenting the nature of his book prior to interview. Marta Kauffman said that \\"The idea that we are pushing an agenda is nonsense,\\" adding that \\"...the dangerous thing about the book is it implies we don't want a dialogue.\\" Another of the interviewees, George Schlatter, rejected suggestions that Hollywood is conspiring to exclude the conservative perspective and accused the right wing of being \\"guilty of everything they accuse the left wing of\\". Reception Reviewing the book and interviewing Shapiro, Los Angeles Times reporter Patrick Goldstein questioned Shapiro citing The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Simpsons as examples, as Goldstein argued those shows have ...\\"gone over like gangbusters with middle America.\\" See also *Media bias in the United States *2011 in literature *The Right Side of History ‚Äì 2019 book by Shapiro References Category:2011 non-fiction books Category:Books about media bias Category:Books about politics of the United States Category:Books critical of modern liberalism in the United States Category:Television in the United States Category:Books about television Category:Television criticism Category:Broadside Books books ","title":"Primetime Propaganda"},{"id":"32041933","text":"Drui is a dance practiced by the Kanak peoples of New Caledonia.

The Rhino was powered by a Beardmore Halford Pullinger inline piston engine. Only two aircraft were built and the type did not enter production. Development and design In mid-1917, the Sopwith Aviation Company prepared a design for a single-engine bomber aircraft, the Sopwith Rhino. As it did not match any official specification, it received no orders from the Royal Flying Corps or Royal Naval Air Service, but Sopwith was granted a licence to allow it to build two prototypes as private ventures. The Rhino was a single bay tractor triplane with ailerons fitted to all three sets of wings. It had a deep fuselage, which accommodated an internal bomb-bay capable of carrying 450 lb (205 kg) of bombs in a self-contained pack that could be loaded with bombs separately and then winched into the aircraft to allow rapid re-arming. Defensive armament was a synchronised Vickers machine gun firing through the propeller disc, while the observer in the rear cockpit had a Lewis gun on a pillar mount. It was powered by a 230 hp (172 kW) BHP inline engine driving a two-bladed propeller, cooled by radiators each side of the fuselage.Robertson 1970, p. 227.Bruce 1957, pp. 617‚Äì618. The first prototype made its maiden flight at Brooklands in October 1917, with initial testing showing it to be nose heavy and subject to engine overheating. The second prototype, which differed in having the primitive pillar mounting for the observer's gun replaced by a more modern scarff ring, joined it for official testing at Martlesham Heath in February and March 1918. Performance was unimpressive, with the aircraft having a poor ceiling and low speed, and it was rejected as a service type.Bruce 1957, pp. 618‚Äì619. The two Rhinos were then used as testbeds for development of propellers.Robertson 1970, p. 228.
