History In 1777 Martinho Coelho and Gustavo- Mauricio Silva De Carvalho Alves discovered the hot water springs that became known as Caldas de Piratinga, later changing the name to Caldas, on the banks of the Caldas River. The discover registered the land and established a ranch on the left bank of the river, which he named \\"Fazenda das Caldas\\". Gold was found in small quantities attracting prospectors and others in search of cures in the hot waters. In 1850 another settlement arose on the right bank of the river near the hot springs, where a church was soon built. In 1857 Caldas Novas became a district and in 1911 it became a municipality. Economy The main source of income of the municipality is tourism. Caldas Novas is known throughout Brazil as one of the largest hydrothermal resorts in the world so in the high season the city receives as many as 100,000 tourists and at carnival as many as 300,000 people. Almost two thousand people are employed in this sector. The infrastructure of the city has more than 80 hotels and pensions (12,000 beds), (many with heated swimming pools and all with hot water produced by the natural thermal system), chalets, clubs, nightclubs, bars and restaurants.

Nationally it was ranked 533 out of 5,507 municipalities. For the complete list see Frigoletto Information about the hot water of Caldas Novas In Caldas Novas there are 86 active wells, pumping an average of 1,200 m¬≥ an hour, in a period of 14 daily hours. The temperature of the water varies between 34 and 57 ¬∞C. The first references to the hot water of this region were published in Spain in 1545. In 1722, Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva, son of the famous bandeirante, Anhang√ºera, turning off the trail blazed by his father years before, discovered the thermal springs that form the Rio Quente. These were called Caldas Velhas and were located in the place where the Rio Quente Resorts is now located. The most important study about the thermal ism of Caldas Novas and the Rio Quente was carried out by the state enterprise Furnas Centrais El√©tricas, due to the possible influence of the Usina Hidrel√©trica Corumb√° I dam on the thermal water table of the region, which would be under the risk of cooling. According to Furnas, the phenomenon of the hot water is produced by peculiar geological and topographic characteristics. For years it was thought that a volcano had existed in the area in whose crater rainwater infiltrated, heating at great depths and then returning to the surface by way of cracks in the rock. More modern studies show that there is no indication of volcanic activity in the region, this theory reinforced by the elliptical form of the Serra de Caldas shown in a satellite photo Studies show that the water is formed by rainfall that is stored in a layer of quartzite and due to pressure is sent to the surface in a column 600 meters. See Rio Quente.com The suspicion that the cold water of the reservoir of Usina Corumb√° I could infiltrate the thermal watertable of Caldas Novas and Rio Quente has no basis, since the waters of the lake are at an elevation of 595 meters, well below the source of the water, at 644 meters. The municipality contains part of the Caldas Novas State Park which protects the Serra de Caldas plateau region that is the main source of water for the geothermal aquifers of the region. Another great attraction of Caldas Novas is Ecotourism, since the city is located near the Corumb√° River and the Caldas Novas State Park. In the surrounding area there is a lake - Lago de Piratininga - with boiling water; a reservoir called Lago de Corumb√° with 64 square kilometers damming the Corumb√°; and another river - the Rio Quente - which has natural warm water. Rio Quente One of the largest hotwater resort complexes in the world - Rio Quente Resorts - is located 20 kilometers to the west of Caldas in the municipality of Rio Quente. With seven hotels, a convention center, and 500 square kilometres of space it receives more than 1 million tourists a year.

Pe√±a's promotion reached its height of popularity in the early 1990s before the downturn of the Mexican economy. Pe√±a's AAA is the promotion largely responsible for bringing the \\"Lucha\\" style to the United States, with such wrestlers as Rey Mysterio Jr., Psicosis, La Parka, Konnan and others. Pe√±a was the former head booker of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) before forming AAA. Pe√±a began his professional wrestling career as a wrestler or Luchador, as they're called in Spanish, working under various masks as El Genio, Espectro Jr., Kahoz, Espectro de Ultratumba and Dalia Negra before retiring in 1986 to work with the promotional side of wrestling. Biography Antonio Pe√±a grew up in a wrestling family in Mexico City, Mexico. His father wrestled as the Luchador Ponzo√±a and his uncle was the famous original Espectro, a big star in the 1950s and 1960s. Pe√±a was trained by Rojas, Isias Rodr√≠guez, To√±o Hern√°ndez and his uncle before making his professional wrestling debut in 1974 at the age of 18. Professional wrestling career Pe√±a began his wrestling career as the enmascarado (masked) character El Genio (Spanish for \\"The Genius\\") on April 8, 1974. After wrestling as El Genio for a couple of months Pe√±a got his uncle's blessing to adopt the Espectro name and began wrestling as Espectro Jr. Pe√±a wore the \\"venom green\\" mask and trunks like Espectro, but unlike the original he wrestled barefoot most of the time. As Espectro Jr., Pe√±a blended a good solid wrestling foundation with various psychological antics to create a character, while being a hated rudo (Heel or \\"bad guy\\") character drew the crowd's attention and soon he found himself challenging the top wrestlers of the 1970s for both the Mexican National Welterweight Championship and the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, two of the top championships in Mexico at the time. While a gifted performer in the ring backstage he was described as more of a quiet, thoughtful person who would often talk about how he would change Lucha Libre and add more character and showmanship to it. In 1980 Pe√±a decided to change wrestling personas, giving the Espectro Jr. outfit and name to his cousin Jose El√≠as Pinceno, who has wrestled as Espectro Jr. since then. Instead of working as Espectro Jr., Pe√±a came up with a totally original character of his own called Kahoz (sometimes spelled Kahos or Khaoz), a sinister masked rudo character who invoked various dark spirits as part of his pre-match ritual. Many have likened the Kahoz character to one of Lucha Libre original showmen, Murci√©lago Vel√°zquez. Kahoz would often carry a bag of live pigeons to the ring with him, releasing them at his opponent and then making it seem like he ripped the head of one of the pigeons and smeared the fake blood all over himself or his opponent. To Pe√±a the Kahoz character was not about winning championships, but about the psychology of the character and actually scaring the audience, so while he did not win any titles as Kahoz it was considered a huge success and he main evented shows all over Mexico. While Pe√±a had the mind for wrestling his body could not handle the heavy main event schedule that he wrestled as Kahoz and by 1985 he gave up the gimmick to work as Espectro de Ultratumba (\\"The Ghost from Beyond the grave\\"), giving the Kahoz gimmick to Astro Rey instead. Astro Rey's Kahoz was nowhere nearly as important nor as successful as Pe√±a as Astro Rey lacked the charisma and theatrics of the original. Pe√±a only worked as Espectro de Ultratumba for a short period of time, giving the gimmick to his cousin in 1986. Pe√±a tried working as \\"Dalia Negra\\" but his body could not take the strain, forcing Pe√±a to retire in 1986. Pe√±a would briefly wrestle as \\"the Rose\\" in 1994 but only worked a handful of matches. Pe√±a's final match at the 2001 Guerra de Titans where he wrestled, and lost to Cibern√©tico. Wrestling promoter Pe√±a had been active backstage for years before his retirement, always offering suggestions of wrestling gimmicks, storylines and booking, so when he retired Pe√±a was hired by Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), Mexico's oldest professional wrestling promotion, to work in their public relations department. Over the next couple of years Pe√±a began booking shows for EMLL and started writing storylines for the company. Pe√±a and head booker Juan Herrera worked together to capitalize on the 1980s television boom, making EMLL the top promotion in its time. Pe√±a and Herrera were also the masterminds of EMLL's \\"Rebranding\\" as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) when EMLL withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance in 1989. Pe√±a was the creative force behind CMLL's Mini-Estrella division and wanted to feature more non- heavyweight wrestlers in the main events. Herrera wanted to maintain the old style of booking with heavyweights such as Atlantis, El Dandy and El Sat√°nico, while Pe√±a wanted to feature younger, faster moving wrestlers such as Konnan, Octag√≥n or M√°scara Sagr√°da. In the end CMLL owner Paco Alonso decided to go with Herrera's booking style. Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n After Paco Alonso chose to ignore Pe√±a's booking ideas Pe√±a began negotiations with Televisa television channel to fund a new wrestling promotion that would provide Televisa with weekly wrestling shows. In 1992 Pe√±a started a booking agency, providing wrestlers and matches for the Televisa owned Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA) promotion. While Pe√±a technically owned the promotion Televisa owns the rights to the AAA name. In 1995 during a financial crisis Televisa sold all rights to AAA to Pe√±a who formed Promociones Antonio Pe√±a. S.A. (PAPSA). Pe√±a's promotion featured many of the young wrestlers that Pe√±a wanted CMLL to push as they chose to leave CMLL to join AAA. AAA's pinnacle came in 1993 when they drew the largest wrestling crowd in Mexico ever as they staged Tripleman√≠a I in front of 48.000 paying fans. Over the years Pe√±a managed to establish AAA as a viable alternative to CMLL, making CMLL and AAA \\"the Big Two\\" in Lucha Libre. =Trademark controversies= Pe√±a was occasionally criticized with trademarking gimmicks and not allowing the original performers of the gimmicks to use the name elsewhere. Wrestlers such as Psicosis and La Parka were both forced to change their ring names when Pe√±a took legal action to bar both of them from using those names in Mexico and gave the gimmicks to two AAA wrestlers. Psicosis now wrestles as \\"Nicho el Millonario\\" in Mexico, while the man that took over the gimmick, Psicosis II now works on the independent circuit. The original La Parka now wrestles as L.A. Park while AAA had their own La Parka for years, until an in-ring accident at an independent show in 2019 would lead to his death in the following year. Pe√±a also tried to prevent the original M√°scara Sagr√°da from using the name and outfit, but in the end Sagr√°da won the court case and the rights to the name. Pe√±a often \\"recycled\\" the ring personas, giving the mask and outfit to a new wrestler if the previous one left AAA, for instance when Super Crazy left AAA Pe√±a gave the Histeria outfit to another wrestler. Death and legacy Pe√±a died on October 5, 2006, due to a massive heart attack. In the days following Pe√±a's death several wrestling promotions in Japan that AAA had worked with over the years paid tribute to the promoter. Pe√±a's death left a void in AAA, he had always been the man in charge and always had the final word. In the years up to his death, Pe√±a had brought in his brother-in-law Joaquin Roldan and Roldan's son Dorian Roldan and taught them the business of running a wrestling promotion. AAA holds a tribute show to Antonio Pe√±a each year around the anniversary of his death as part of the Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Shows AAA holds the Copa Antonio Pe√±a, a tournament in honor of Pe√±a. From 2009 onwards the annual event has been known as H√©roes Inmortales (\\"Immortal Heroes\\").

It runs from an intersection with U.S. Route 166 (US-166) and US-400 northwest of the Missouri/Kansas/Oklahoma tripoint north to K-66 in Galena. The highway is maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). The route was designated in 1937 on a roadway that ran from Crestline to the Missouri state line, but was moved to its current location via a series of route re- designations that took place over the following decades, assuming its current route in the mid-1980s. Route description Approaching the junction of K-26 on US 166 and US 400. K-26 begins at an intersection with US-166 and US-40 east of Baxter Springs. The roadway heads north through a wooded area, passing several farms. The route then crosses Shoal Creek and enters the city of Galena as Main Street. In Galena, K-26 reaches its northern terminus at K-66, which is also known as 7th Street. Main Street continues north of the intersection toward a BNSF Railway line. The route is maintained by KDOT, which is responsible for constructing and maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, KDOT regularly surveys traffic on their highways. These surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic, which is a measurement of the number of vehicles that use a highway during an average day of the year. In 2010, KDOT calculated that a total of 3230 vehicles used the road daily, including 225 trucks. No part of the highway has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's defense, mobility, and economy. History K-26 was first designated in 1937 over the former eastern segment of K-34, a gravel road that ran from K-96 and US-69 in Crestline east to the Missouri state line. In 1941, K-26 and the easternmost portion of K-96 switch designations. After this, K-26 ran from US-66 west of Galena north to K-96 and US-69. This roadway was paved when K-26 was designated along it. Between 1948 and 1953, the highway was extended east along US-66 to Galena and south from there to its current southern terminus at US-166. In the mid-1980s when US-66 was decommissioned, the portion of K-26 along it was re-signed as K-66 and the portion of the highway from US-66 to Crestline was designated as part of U.S. Route 69 Alternate (US-69 Alt).

The Boston Ten Townships refers to an area of 230,400 acres (932 km¬≤) in Tioga County and Broome County, New York State, between the Chenango River (to Chenango Forks) and Tioughnioga River (east boundary) and the west branch of Owego Creek (west boundary), from the Susquehanna River about twenty-five miles northwards; it includes the northern half of the town of Owego and the towns of Newark Valley, Berkshire, and Richford in Tioga County, and a portion of the Broome County towns of Lisle, Nanticoke and Maine east of these. It is bounded on the west by the Watkins and Flint Purchase and a small portion of the original Chemung County, and on the north by the Central New York Military Tract (present-day Cortland County). The boundary between Tioga County and Broome County is very irregular. The Treaty of Hartford of 1786 settled the western boundary between Massachusetts and New York at the modern largely north-south east of the Hudson River (except for Boston Corners, which was transferred later). As part of the treaty, New York gained undisputed sovereignty over the area, but granted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the right to purchase the property rights from the local Indians. This right was subsequently purchased in the same year by a company of Boston investors (originally 11, later 60) named the Boston Purchase Company. One of the investors, Colonel Avid Pixley, came to the area to negotiate with the native inhabitants for the land rights. Most of the investors actually settled in the area, and were soon able to extinguish the Indian claims by purchase from the Oneida; one half-township of Owego (including the village) had already been acquired from the Oneida by James McMaster; some delicate negotiations led to his claim being recognized as the McMaster Patent.

The Hyak departs Bremerton with her 9:45 AM sailing to Seattle. Alki Point from the on her final day of service The MV Hyak is a Super-class ferry that was operated by Washington State Ferries. Built in 1966 at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company shipyard in San Diego, the ferry began service on July 20, 1967 and normally ran on the Seattle‚ÄìBremerton route or the Anacortes‚ÄìSan Juan Islands run. Hyak is chinook jargon for \\"speedy\\". History The Hyak was built by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company of San Diego, California in 1966, at a cost of $6.5 million. It was launched and christened by Nancy Evans, wife of Governor Daniel J. Evans, on December 17, 1966. The vessel traveled north along the Pacific Coast in June 1967, but was delayed by a severe storm near San Francisco, California broke a temporary breakwater. She arrived in Seattle on July 4, several days later than scheduled, and was moved to the Todd Shipyards for repairs. The word Hyak is chinook jargon for \\"speedy\\". The ferry was not able to enter service after arrival because of an ongoing labor dispute with the local chapter of the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots. The union argued that the wage agreement it signed with Washington State Ferries did not cover new, larger vessels like the Hyak. The dispute reached the King County Superior Court, where a judge signed an injunction ordering the ferry to be manned on its first run on July 19. The Hyak entered service that afternoon, and was assigned to the Seattle‚ÄìBremerton route, cutting the crossing time from 65 minutes to 45. The next day, the ferry made its first scheduled run and nearly rammed Pier 52 in Seattle after an engine failure. Unlike her sisters, the Hyak has not had her cabin refurbished. In June 2015, the Hyak was replaced by the in the third sailing spot in the San Juans. It was moved to the Seattle‚ÄìBremerton route for the remainder of its life, but returned to the San Juan route several times to replace vessels undergoing maintenance. The Hyak primarily served as a standby vessel for the rest of the fleet and was considered for experimental conversion to use hybrid diesel-electric generators until the plan was scrapped in 2015. The retirement of the Hyak, originally anticipated for the arrival of , was delayed into 2019 after replaced it as a relief vessel. The Hyak had a $37 million maintenance backlog that was left unaddressed by the state legislature, which allocated $2 million in supplemental funds to operate the ferry until June 2019. The supplemental funds were not extended in the 2019‚Äì21 transportation budget, signaling the vessel's retirement. On June 30, 2019, the Hyak made its final run on the Seattle‚ÄìBremerton route; the vessel's retirement caused schedule modifications on several routes to accommodate the downsized fleet. The Hyak will be stripped of its usable equipment and prepared for sale as surplus property. Incidents On April 14, 1986, the Hyak ran aground in Anacortes, Washington after a navigational error made by the crew, placing the ferry in shallow water above a reef. Only one injury was reported of the 250 people on board, but the ferry sustained damage that cost $250,000 to repair. On September 13, 2013, the Hyak collided with a private sailboat between Orcas and Shaw islands. No one was injured. The sailboat, however, was damaged and sank about 20 minutes after the accident.

The purpose of removing the sulfur, and creating products such as ultra-low-sulfur diesel, is to reduce the sulfur dioxide () emissions that result from using those fuels in automotive vehicles, aircraft, railroad locomotives, ships, gas or oil burning power plants, residential and industrial furnaces, and other forms of fuel combustion. Another important reason for removing sulfur from the naphtha streams within a petroleum refinery is that sulfur, even in extremely low concentrations, poisons the noble metal catalysts (platinum and rhenium) in the catalytic reforming units that are subsequently used to upgrade the octane rating of the naphtha streams. The industrial hydrodesulfurization processes include facilities for the capture and removal of the resulting hydrogen sulfide () gas. In petroleum refineries, the hydrogen sulfide gas is then subsequently converted into byproduct elemental sulfur or sulfuric acid (). In fact, the vast majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from refineries and other hydrocarbon processing plants.Sulfur production report by the United States Geological SurveyDiscussion of recovered byproduct sulfur An HDS unit in the petroleum refining industry is also often referred to as a hydrotreater. History Although some reactions involving catalytic hydrogenation of organic substances were already known, the property of finely divided nickel to catalyze the fixation of hydrogen on hydrocarbon (ethylene, benzene) double bonds was discovered by the French chemist Paul Sabatier in 1897.C.R.Acad.Sci. 1897, 132, 210C.R.Acad.Sci. 1901, 132, 210 Through this work, he found that unsaturated hydrocarbons in the vapor phase could be converted into saturated hydrocarbons by using hydrogen and a catalytic metal, laying the foundation of the modern catalytic hydrogenation process. Soon after Sabatier's work, a German chemist, Wilhelm Normann, found that catalytic hydrogenation could be used to convert unsaturated fatty acids or glycerides in the liquid phase into saturated ones. He was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902DE Patent DE141029 (Espacenet, record not available) and in Britain in 1903,UK Patent GB190301515 GB190301515 (Espacenet) which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry. In the mid-1950s, the first noble metal catalytic reforming process (the Platformer process) was commercialized. At the same time, the catalytic hydrodesulfurization of the naphtha feed to such reformers was also commercialized. In the decades that followed, various proprietary catalytic hydrodesulfurization processes, such as the one depicted in the flow diagram below, have been commercialized. Currently, virtually all of the petroleum refineries worldwide have one or more HDS units. By 2006, miniature microfluidic HDS units had been implemented for treating JP-8 jet fuel to produce clean feed stock for a fuel cell hydrogen reformer.Microchannel HDS (March 2006) By 2007, this had been integrated into an operating 5 kW fuel cell generation system. Process chemistry Hydrogenation is a class of chemical reactions in which the net result is the addition of hydrogen (H). Hydrogenolysis is a type of hydrogenation and results in the cleavage of the C-X chemical bond, where C is a carbon atom and X is a sulfur (S), nitrogen (N) or oxygen (O) atom. The net result of a hydrogenolysis reaction is the formation of C-H and H-X chemical bonds. Thus, hydrodesulfurization is a hydrogenolysis reaction. Using ethanethiol (), a sulfur compound present in some petroleum products, as an example, the hydrodesulfurization reaction can be simply expressed as : \\\\overset{Ethanethiol}{C2H5SH} + \\\\overset{Hydrogen}{H2} -> \\\\overset{Ethane}{C2H6} + \\\\overset{Hydrogen\\\\ sulfide}{H2S} For the mechanistic aspects of, and the catalysts used in this reaction see the section catalysts and mechanisms. Process description In an industrial hydrodesulfurization unit, such as in a refinery, the hydrodesulfurization reaction takes place in a fixed-bed reactor at elevated temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 ¬∞C and elevated pressures ranging from 30 to 130 atmospheres of absolute pressure, typically in the presence of a catalyst consisting of an alumina base impregnated with cobalt and molybdenum (usually called a CoMo catalyst). Occasionally, a combination of nickel and molybdenum (called NiMo) is used, in addition to the CoMo catalyst, for specific difficult-to-treat feed stocks, such as those containing a high level of chemically bound nitrogen. The image below is a schematic depiction of the equipment and the process flow streams in a typical refinery HDS unit. Schematic diagram of a typical Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) unit in a petroleum refinery The liquid feed (at the bottom left in the diagram) is pumped up to the required elevated pressure and is joined by a stream of hydrogen-rich recycle gas. The resulting liquid- gas mixture is preheated by flowing through a heat exchanger. The preheated feed then flows through a fired heater where the feed mixture is totally vaporized and heated to the required elevated temperature before entering the reactor and flowing through a fixed-bed of catalyst where the hydrodesulfurization reaction takes place. The hot reaction products are partially cooled by flowing through the heat exchanger where the reactor feed was preheated and then flows through a water-cooled heat exchanger before it flows through the pressure controller (PC) and undergoes a pressure reduction down to about 3 to 5 atmospheres. The resulting mixture of liquid and gas enters the gas separator vessel at about 35 ¬∞C and 3 to 5 atmospheres of absolute pressure. Most of the hydrogen-rich gas from the gas separator vessel is recycle gas, which is routed through an amine contactor for removal of the reaction product that it contains. The -free hydrogen-rich gas is then recycled back for reuse in the reactor section. Any excess gas from the gas separator vessel joins the sour gas from the stripping of the reaction product liquid. The liquid from the gas separator vessel is routed through a reboiled stripper distillation tower. The bottoms product from the stripper is the final desulfurized liquid product from hydrodesulfurization unit. The overhead sour gas from the stripper contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That sour gas is sent to the refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main amine gas treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and pentane or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery fuel gas. The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric acid process or in the conventional Contact Process. Note that the above description assumes that the HDS unit feed contains no olefins. If the feed does contain olefins (for example, the feed is a naphtha derived from a refinery fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) unit), then the overhead gas from the HDS stripper may also contain some ethene, propene, butenes and pentenes, or heavier components. The amine solution to and from the recycle gas contactor comes from and is returned to the refinery's main amine gas treating unit. Sulfur compounds in refinery HDS feedstocks The refinery HDS feedstocks (naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, and heavier oils) contain a wide range of organic sulfur compounds, including thiols, thiophenes, organic sulfides and disulfides, and many others. These organic sulfur compounds are products of the degradation of sulfur containing biological components, present during the natural formation of the fossil fuel, petroleum crude oil. When the HDS process is used to desulfurize a refinery naphtha, it is necessary to remove the total sulfur down to the parts per million range or lower in order to prevent poisoning the noble metal catalysts in the subsequent catalytic reforming of the naphthas. When the process is used for desulfurizing diesel oils, the latest environmental regulations in the United States and Europe, requiring what is referred to as ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), in turn requires that very deep hydrodesulfurization is needed. In the very early 2000s, the governmental regulatory limits for highway vehicle diesel was within the range of 300 to 500 ppm by weight of total sulfur. As of 2006, the total sulfur limit for highway diesel is in the range of 15 to 30 ppm by weight.Diesel Sulfur published online by the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association (NPRA) Thiophenes A family of substrates that are particularly common in petroleum are the aromatic sulfur-containing heterocycles called thiophenes. Many kinds of thiophenes occur in petroleum ranging from thiophene itself to more condensed derivatives called benzothiophenes and dibenzothiophenes. Thiophene itself and its alkyl derivatives are easier to hydrogenolyse, whereas dibenzothiophene, especially its 4,6-disubstituted derivatives, are considered the most challenging substrates. Benzothiophenes are midway between the simple thiophenes and dibenzothiophenes in their susceptibility to HDS. Catalysts and mechanisms The main HDS catalysts are based on molybdenum disulfide () together with smaller amounts of other metals.Tops√∏e, H.; Clausen, B. S.; Massoth, F. E., Hydrotreating Catalysis, Science and Technology, Springer-Verlag: Berlin, 1996. The nature of the sites of catalytic activity remains an active area of investigation, but it is generally assumed basal planes of the structure are not relevant to catalysis, rather the edges or rims of these sheet.Daage, M.; Chianelli, R. R., \\"Structure-Function Relations in Molybdenum Sulfide Catalysts - the Rim-Edge Model\\", J. of Catalysis, 1994, 149, 414-427. At the edges of the crystallites, the molybdenum centre can stabilize a coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS), also known as an anion vacancy. Substrates, such as thiophene, bind to this site and undergo a series of reactions that result in both C-S scission and C=C hydrogenation. Thus, the hydrogen serves multiple roles‚Äîgeneration of anion vacancy by removal of sulfide, hydrogenation, and hydrogenolysis. A simplified diagram for the cycle is shown: Simplified diagram of a HDS cycle for thiophene Catalysts Most metals catalyse HDS, but it is those at the middle of the transition metal series that are most active. Although not practical, ruthenium disulfide appears to be the single most active catalyst, but binary combinations of cobalt and molybdenum are also highly active.Chianelli, R. R.; Berhault, G.; Raybaud, P.; Kasztelan, S.; Hafner, J. and Toulhoat, H., \\"Periodic trends in hydrodesulfurization: in support of the Sabatier principle\\", Applied Catalysis, A, 2002, volume 227, pages 83-96. Aside from the basic cobalt-modified MoS2 catalyst, nickel and tungsten are also used, depending on the nature of the feed. For example, Ni-W catalysts are more effective for hydrodenitrogenation . Supports Metal sulfides are supported on materials with high surface areas. A typical support for HDS catalyst is Œ≥-alumina. The support allows the more expensive catalyst to be more widely distributed, giving rise to a larger fraction of the that is catalytically active. The interaction between the support and the catalyst is an area of intense interest, since the support is often not fully inert but participates in the catalysis. Other uses The basic hydrogenolysis reaction has a number of uses other than hydrodesulfurization. Hydrodenitrogenation The hydrogenolysis reaction is also used to reduce the nitrogen content of a petroleum stream in a process referred to as hydrodenitrogenation (HDN). The process flow is the same as that for an HDS unit. Using pyridine (), a nitrogen compound present in some petroleum fractionation products, as an example, the hydrodenitrogenation reaction has been postulated as occurring in three steps:Kinetics and Interactions of the Simultaneous Catalytic Hydrodenitrogenation of Pyridine and Hydrodesulfurization of Thiophene (John Wilkins, PhD Thesis, \\\\overset{}{MIT}, 1977)Simultaneous Catalytic Hydrodenitrogenation of Pyridine and Hydrodesulfurization of Thiophene (Satterfield,C.N., Modell, M. and Wilkens, J.A., Ind.

Saturation of olefins The hydrogenolysis reaction may also be used to saturate or convert olefins (alkenes) into paraffins (alkanes). The process used is the same as for an HDS unit. As an example, the saturation of the olefin pentene can be simply expressed as: : \\\\overset{Pentene}{C5H10} + \\\\overset{Hydrogen}{H2} -> \\\\overset{Pentane}{C5H12} Some hydrogenolysis units within a petroleum refinery or a petrochemical plant may be used solely for the saturation of olefins or they may be used for simultaneously desulfurizing as well as denitrogenating and saturating olefins to some extent. Hydrogenation in the food industry The food industry uses hydrogenation to completely or partially saturate the unsaturated fatty acids in liquid vegetable fats and oils to convert them into solid or semi-solid fats, such as those in margarine and shortening.

Lowe was born and raised in County Durham, in a family with Irish roots. He is known primarily for his compositions dealing with daily life in North-East England, particularly in his hometown of Easington Colliery. He attended St Francis RC Grammar School in nearby Hartlepool and later studied languages at Sunderland Polytechnic. He performs both as a solo artist and with his backing band, The Bad Pennies. In addition to singing his songs, Lowe accompanies himself and The Bad Pennies on guitar, harmonica, cittern, and piano.  Songwriting  Lowe on stage in Hobart, Australia in 1997 Jez Lowe performing at TwickFolk, February 2015 John Gerard Lowe grew up witnessing the decline of the coal-mining industry that had defined the region's economic profile for generations. A great many of Lowe's compositions address the economic distress that the North Country has suffered as a result of this industrial decline, and the social repercussions thereof. \\"Galloways,\\" \\"Nearer to Nettles,\\" and \\"These Coal Town Days\\" are among the songs that directly address economic conditions. In the much larger category of social impact songs, well known Lowe compositions are \\"Big Meeting Day,\\" \\"Greek Lightning,\\" and \\"Last of the Widows.\\" (His song, \\"Last of the Widows\\", was written in 1991 to mark the fortieth anniversary of the pit disaster at Easington Colliery.) Numerous other songs by Lowe deal with the general issues of poverty and limited social opportunity in the region. The song \\"A Lass to Want Me\\" was written after meeting David Miedzianik, an autistic man from Rotherham, in 1993. It was first released in 1997 on A Season of Changes: The Autistic Awareness Album, a compilation of songs about autism released as a benefit for an autism centre in Doncaster, and then in 2003 on an expanded reissue of his 1998 album The Parish Notices.  Recent projects  In 2006 Lowe contributed to the BBC Radio 2 Radio Ballads documentary series broadcast on Radio 2 as a homage to the original series of the same title, pioneered by Ewan MacColl and Charles Parker in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Jez Lowe was commissioned to write 22 new songs for the documentary-folk series, which were not all performed by Lowe but featured guest vocals from the likes of Barry Coope, Bob Fox and many more. The series went on to win two Sony Radio Academy Awards. In 2008, Lowe was nominated as 'Folksinger of the Year'in the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, but ultimately lost the category to young Scottish singer and instrumentalist Julie Fowlis. In 2015, Lowe received two nominations for the BBC Folk Awards, as Folksinger of the Year and for Song of the Year (\\"The Pitmen Poets\\"), but again failed to win in either category. He was on tour in Canada at the time of the ceremony, with James Keelaghan and Archie Fisher, under the trio-name \\"Men At Words\\". Jez has an on-going working partnership with guitarist/singer-songwriter Steve Tilston, which sees them do thirty-plus concerts together every year, and which resulted in the album \\"The Janus Game\\" in 2016, consisting entirely of new songs written by Tilston and Lowe in collaboration. Since 2011, Jez has been part of a quartet known as The Pitmen Poets, alongside Benny Graham, Billy Mitchell and Bob Fox. They have toured extensively every few years around the UK, and have released three albums of songs about the coal mining communities of North east England. In January 2018, Lowe published his first novel, \\"The Dillen Doll\\", through the independent publisher Badapple Books. The story of the novel includes many references to traditional North East of England folk songs, many of which are included on a CD, also called \\"The Dillen Doll\\", presented as a continuous \\"suite\\" of music and songs which culminates in the song \\"Dol Li A\\", upon which the story is based. A second novel, \\"The Corly Croons\\", is due for publication in October 2019. The latest series of the BBC Radio Ballads, The Ballad of The Great War, was scheduled to come to an end in November 2018. This series has featured more than a dozen Jez Lowe songs (bringing it to a total of over fifty of his songs that have been used since the \\"new\\" radio Ballads project began in 2006). Jez also provided the lyrics to John Tams's theme music for this series, entitled \\"The Cherry-Cheeked Optimists\\", from episodes two to five. An off-shoot from the Radio Ballads, a project called \\"The Ballads of Child Migration\\", also features three Jez Lowe songs and was released on CD in 2015. Two further songs were composed by Jez for inclusion in a BBC Radio Two production of Michael Morpurgo's book \\"Alone on a Wide, Wide Sea\\" in 2017, which is linked to the Child Migration project.  Broadcasting  As well as the BBC Radio Ballads series, Jez Lowe has also made several broadcasts for BBC radio, starting with a series of five programmes in 1999 called A Song For Geordie, which he scripted and introduced. It was a comprehensive introduction to the many aspects of folk music from North East England, and included interviews with Ed Pickford, Benny Graham, Vin Garbutt, Mark Knopfler, Annie Fentiman, Terri Freeman and others. One programme from this series was re- broadcast on BBC 6 Music in 2018. He has also been guest presenter on the BBC Radio 4 series Open Country, for a programme about Tynemouth, along with other contributions to the series as an interviewee in the last ten years. He was scheduled to present another episode of Open Country later in 2019.

Early career He was the son of the journalist and publisher Wilfrid Meynell and the poet Alice Meynell, a suffragist and prominent Roman Catholic convert. After leaving Trinity College, Dublin, he joined his father at the publisher Burns & Oates. In 1913 he was brought in by George Lansbury to be business manager of the 'Daily Herald'.John Shepherd, George Lansbury: At the Heart of Old Labour (2004), p. 146 In 1912 he came to the notice of wealthy American, Mary Melissa Hoadley Dodge, who was domiciled in England. She knew Meynell's parents and had seen him speak in defence of activists of the suffragette movement in Queen's Hall. With her companion, Countess Muriel De La Warr, she provided support and funding for him in 1916 to start the Pelican Press and also helped with funding for the Daily Herald. In 1921 Meynell was editor of the weekly paper The Communist and became involved with a libel action that he lost. The award against him was ¬£2000, and not being able to pay he filed for bankruptcy. Dodge and De La Warr came to his rescue but requested that their donation remain anonymous. Dodge became a godparent to Meynell's first child, Cynthia, in 1915. Conscientious objector Meynell became liable for call-up for military service in 1916, and applied for exemption on the ground of being a conscientious objector. He appeared before a local tribunal in Marylebone in August 1916 and a county appeal tribunal in September. He was granted exemption from combatant service only, and surrendered himself to the civil police on 29 January 1917. Handed over by Westminster magistrates to the military authorities, he was held in the guard room at Hounslow Barracks and went on hunger strike. After three weeks in hospital, he was on 28 February 1917 discharged by the army as being unlikely to become an efficient soldier.The Tribunal, 8 March 1917 He returned to his work at the Pelican Press and the Herald.

His fusion of progressive politics and conservative aesthetic tastes, similar to those of William Morris caused some amusement amongst his friends; the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science notes that \\"he once set a left-wing propaganda pamphlet in Cloister Old Face and surrounded it with a border of 17th-century fleurons.\\" Family Meynell married three times. His first wife was Hilda Peppercorn (1886-1962), daughter of painter Arthur Douglas Peppercorn. She was a concert pianist who performed using the name Hilda Saxe. She married Meynell in 1914 and they had one child, Cynthia. In 1925, following his divorce from Hilda, Meynell married Vera Rosalind Wynn Mendel (1895-1947). She was the daughter of Edith Wynne and William Mendel, a German born financier who had underwritten several stock market flotations in the late 19th century including Harrods and D. H. Evans. Vera and their mutual friend David Garnett provided the initial funding for the Nonesuch Press; she also helped in the early days with production and distribution. They had a son in 1930 (Benedict) and divorced in 1945. Vera took her own life on August 4, 1947. Meynell was knighted in 1946 and in the same year married Alix Kilroy (1903‚Äì1999), a civil servant with the Board of Trade.

The photo also shows the support vessel above the surface in the background. Underwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment. Immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types of work to be done. In ambient pressure diving, the diver is directly exposed to the pressure of the surrounding water. The ambient pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long- duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans. The environment exposes the diver to a wide range of hazards, and though the risks are largely controlled by appropriate diving skills, training, types of equipment and breathing gases used depending on the mode, depth and purpose of diving, it remains a relatively dangerous activity. Diving activities are restricted to maximum depths of about for recreational scuba diving, for commercial saturation diving, and wearing atmospheric suits. Diving is also restricted to conditions which are not excessively hazardous, though the level of risk acceptable can vary. Recreational diving (sometimes called sport diving or subaquatics) is a popular leisure activity. Technical diving is a form of recreational diving under especially challenging conditions. Professional diving (commercial diving, diving for research purposes, or for financial gain) involves working underwater. Public safety diving is the underwater work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and underwater search and recovery dive teams. Military diving includes combat diving, clearance diving and ships husbandry. Deep sea diving is underwater diving, usually with surface-supplied equipment, and often refers to the use of standard diving dress with the traditional copper helmet. Hard hat diving is any form of diving with a helmet, including the standard copper helmet, and other forms of free-flow and lightweight demand helmets. The history of breath-hold diving goes back at least to classical times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War. Physiological constraints on diving Immersion in water and exposure to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful work to be done underwater. Immersion Immersion of the human body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the external hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift. The blood shift causes an increased respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly because of the diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and resistance to air flow in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged. Exposure Cold shock response is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, and is a common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination. The diving reflex is a response to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals. Hypothermia is reduced body temperature that happens when a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn increases the risk of other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers. Breath-hold limitations Breath-hold diving by an air- breathing animal is limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown. Blackouts in freediving can occur when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue towards the end of the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth. Ascent-induced hypoxia is caused by a drop in oxygen partial pressure as ambient pressure is reduced. The partial pressure of oxygen at depth may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that depth and not at the reduced pressures nearer the surface. Ambient pressure changes Mild barotrauma to a diver caused by mask squeeze Barotrauma, an example of dysbarism, is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or in contact with the body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure. The initial damage is usually due to over-stretching the tissues in tension or shear, either directly by expansion of the gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue. Barotrauma generally manifests as sinus or middle ear effects, DCS, lung over-expansion injuries, and injuries resulting from external squeezes. Barotraumas of descent are caused by preventing the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the gas space, and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture. Barotraumas of ascent are also caused when the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver is prevented. In this case the pressure difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system. This can cause blockage of circulation at distant sites, or interfere with the normal function of an organ by its presence. Breathing under pressure Provision of breathing gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong the duration of a dive, but there are other problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression. Other problems arise when the concentration of metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between the interior of the lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles. Sensory impairment Views through a flat mask, above and below water Underwater vision is affected by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this is affected by the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination. Water has different acoustic properties from those of air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. Human hearing underwater, in cases where the diver's ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect. Tactile sensory perception in divers may be impaired by the environmental protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced. Balance and equilibrium depend on vestibular function and secondary input from visual, organic, cutaneous, kinesthetic and sometimes auditory senses which are processed by the central nervous system to provide the sense of balance. Underwater, some of these inputs may be absent or diminished, making the remaining cues more important. Conflicting input may result in vertigo, disorientation and motion sickness. The vestibular sense is essential in these conditions for rapid, intricate and accurate movement. Proprioceptive perception makes the diver aware of personal position and movement, in association with the vestibular and visual input, and allows the diver to function effectively in maintaining physical equilibrium and balance in the water. In the water at neutral buoyancy, the proprioceptive cues of position are reduced or absent. This effect may be exacerbated by the diver's suit and other equipment. Taste and smell are not very important to the diver in the water but more important to the saturation diver while in accommodation chambers. There is evidence of a slight decrease in threshold for taste and smell after extended periods under pressure. Diving modes There are several modes of diving based on the diving equipment used. Freediving alt= A croup of three divers dressed in wetsuits standing on a rocky shore with the sea in the background. On the ground are inflated truck inner tube floats with nets to support their catch The ability to dive and swim underwater while holding one's breath is considered a useful emergency skill, an important part of water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity. Underwater diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as underwater swimming, snorkelling and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive underwater sports are practised without breathing apparatus. Freediving precludes the use of external breathing devices, and relies on the ability of divers to hold their breath until resurfacing. The technique ranges from simple breath-hold diving to competitive apnea dives. Fins and a diving mask are often used in free diving to improve vision and provide more efficient propulsion. A short breathing tube called a snorkel allows the diver to breathe at the surface while the face is immersed. Snorkelling on the surface with no intention of diving is a popular water sport and recreational activity. Scuba diving Scuba diving is diving with a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, which is completely independent of surface supply. Scuba gives the diver mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE). Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers. Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas. Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference. A scuba diver moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications. Surface-supplied diving An alternative to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases from the surface through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line it is called the diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified. Saturation diving lets professional divers live and work under pressure for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, the divers rest and live in a dry pressurised underwater habitat on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers on the deck of a diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating platform at a similar pressure to the work depth. They are transferred between the surface accommodation and the underwater workplace in a pressurised closed diving bell. Decompression at the end of the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater work efficiency and safety. Commercial divers refer to diving operations where the diver starts and finishes the diving operation at atmospheric pressure as surface oriented, or bounce diving. The diver may be deployed from the shore or a diving support vessel and may be transported on a diving or in a diving bell. Surface-supplied divers almost always wear diving helmets or full face diving masks. The bottom gas can be air, nitrox, heliox or trimix; the decompression gases may be similar, or may include pure oxygen. Decompression procedures include in-water decompression or surface decompression in a deck chamber. A wet bell with a gas filled dome provides more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress on oxygen at . Small closed bell systems have been designed that can be easily mobilised, and include a two-man bell, a handling frame and a chamber for decompression after transfer under pressure (TUP). Divers can breathe air or mixed gas at the bottom and are usually recovered with the chamber filled with air. They decompress on oxygen supplied through built in breathing systems (BIBS) towards the end of the decompression. Small bell systems support bounce diving down to and for bottom times up to 2 hours. A relatively portable surface gas supply system using high pressure gas cylinders for both primary and reserve gas, but using the full diver's umbilical system with pneumofathometer and voice communication, is known in the industry as \\"scuba replacement\\". Compressor diving is a rudimentary method of surface-supplied diving used in some tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips. Atmospheric pressure diving Submersibles and rigid atmospheric diving suits (ADS) enable diving to be carried out in a dry environment at normal atmospheric pressure. An ADS is a small one-person articulated submersible which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate joints to allow bending, while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. An ADS can be used for dives of up to about for many hours. It eliminates the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving ‚Äì the occupant need not decompress, there is no need for special gas mixtures, and there is no danger of nitrogen narcosis ‚Äì at the expense of higher cost, complex logistics and loss of dexterity. Unmanned diving Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute part of a larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non- autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs). Range of diving activities People may dive for various reasons, both personal and professional. Recreational diving is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving. Several underwater sports are available for exercise and competition. There are various aspects of professional diving that range from part-time work to lifelong careers. Professionals in the recreational diving industry include instructor trainers, diving instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters, dive guides, and scuba technicians. A scuba diving tourism industry has developed to service recreational diving in regions with popular dive sites. Commercial diving is industry related and includes civil engineering tasks such as in oil exploration, offshore construction, dam maintenance and harbour works. Commercial divers may also be employed to perform tasks related to marine activities, such as naval diving, including the repair and inspection of boats and ships, marine salvage or aquaculture. Other specialist areas of diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. They can perform roles including direct combat, reconnaissance, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines, bomb disposal or engineering operations. In civilian operations, police diving units perform search and rescue operations, and recover evidence. In some cases diver rescue teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service, sea rescue or lifeguard unit, and this may be classed as public safety diving. There are also professional divers such as underwater photographers and videographers, who record the underwater world, and scientific divers in fields of study which involve the underwater environment, including marine biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers and underwater archaeologists. The choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice. History Freediving as a widespread means of hunting and gathering, both for food and other valuable resources such as pearls and coral, dates from before 4500 BCE. By classical Greek and Roman times commercial diving applications such as sponge diving and marine salvage were established. Military diving goes back at least as far as the Peloponnesian War, with recreational and sporting applications being a recent development. Technological development in ambient pressure diving started with stone weights (skandalopetra) for fast descent. The diving bell is one of the earliest types of equipment for underwater work and exploration. Its use was first described by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE. In the 16th and 17th centuries CE, diving bells became more useful when a renewable supply of air could be provided to the diver at depth, and progressed to surface-supplied diving helmets ‚Äì in effect miniature diving bells covering the diver's head and supplied with compressed air by manually operated pumps ‚Äì which were improved by attaching a waterproof suit to the helmet. In the early 19th century these became the standard diving dress, which made a far wider range of marine civil engineering and salvage projects practicable. Limitations in mobility of the surface-supplied systems encouraged the development of both open circuit and closed circuit scuba in the 20th century, which allow the diver a much greater autonomy. These became popular during the Second World War for clandestine military operations, and post-war for scientific, search and rescue, media diving, recreational and technical diving. The heavy free- flow surface-supplied copper helmets evolved into lightweight demand helmets, which are more economical with breathing gas, important for deeper dives using expensive helium based breathing mixtures. Saturation diving reduced the risks of DCS for deep and long exposures. An alternative approach was the development of the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface-supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface-supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles. Physiological discoveries alt= A full height monochrome portrait of a middle-aged white man with a receding hairline and a bushy moustache. By the late 19th century, as salvage operations became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; it was later renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made at the time of Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes. French physiologist Paul Bert was the first to understand it as DCS. His work, La Pression barom√©trique (1878), was a comprehensive investigation into the physiological effects of air pressure, both above and below the normal. He determined that inhaling pressurised air caused nitrogen to dissolve into the bloodstream; rapid depressurisation would then release the nitrogen into its gaseous state, forming bubbles that could block the blood circulation and potentially cause paralysis or death. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity was also first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Paul Bert effect\\". John Scott Haldane designed a decompression chamber in 1907, and he produced the first decompression tables for the Royal Navy in 1908 after extensive experiments with animals and human subjects. These tables established a method of decompression in stages ‚Äì it remains the basis for decompression methods to this day. Following Haldane's recommendation, the maximum safe operating depth for divers was extended to . The US Navy continued research into decompression, and in 1915 the first Bureau of Construction and Repair decompression tables were developed by French and Stilson. Experimental dives were conducted in the 1930s, forming the basis for the 1937 US Navy air decompression tables. Surface decompression and oxygen use were also researched in the 1930s. The US Navy 1957 tables were developed to correct problems found in the 1937 tables. In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills published their paper, A thermodynamic approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops before it can be eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression. M.P. Spencer showed that Doppler ultrasonic methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS is not yet fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce the effects of the hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers. Diving environment alt= A diver is visible underwater in a hole cut in the ice cover of a small lake. Blocks of ice cut to form the hole are stacked to one side, and a second diver sits on the edge of the hole with his legs in the water. A rough wooden ladder bridges the hole. The dive site is cordoned off with a red and white tape, and other members of the support team stand to the side, with onlookers outside the cordon. The diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. Benign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. Open water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. Open-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. Wall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid- water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. Black-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. An overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. Night diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment, because many marine animals are nocturnal. Altitude diving, for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure. Depth range A technical diver using a closed circuit alt= A scuba diver in a wetsuit holds onto the shotline at a decompression stop.

The recreational diving depth limit set by the EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 level 2 \\"Autonomous Diver\\" standard is . The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from for PADI divers, (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council, for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, and for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. For technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI. is the world record depth on scuba (2014). Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed , but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of in 1988. Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to in one. Dive sites Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt, a world- renowned recreational dive sitealt= View of the coastal waters from the top of a hill, showing an approximately circular hole in the shallow coastal reef tangent to the deeper water offshore. The common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low. Diving procedures Due to the inherent risks of the environment and the necessity to operate the equipment correctly, both under normal conditions and during incidents where failure to respond appropriately and quickly can have fatal consequences, a set of standard procedures are used in preparation of the equipment, preparation to dive, during the dive if all goes according to plan, after the dive, and in the event of a reasonably foreseeable contingency. The standard procedures are not necessarily the only course of action that will have a satisfactory outcome, but they are generally those procedures which have been found by experiment and experience to work well and reliably when applied in response to the given circumstances. All formal diver training is based on the learning of standard skills and procedures, and in many cases the over-learning of the skills until the procedures can be performed without hesitation even when distracting circumstances exist. Where reasonably practicable, checklists may be used to ensure that preparatory procedures are carried out in the correct sequence and that no steps are inadvertently omitted. Some procedures are common to all manned modes of diving, but most are specific to the mode of diving and many are specific to the equipment in use. Diving procedures are those which are directly relevant to diving safety and efficiency, but do not include task specific skills. Standard procedures are particularly helpful where communication is by hand or rope signal ‚Äì the hand and line signals are examples of standard procedures themselves ‚Äì as the communicating parties have a better idea of what the other is likely to do in response. Where voice communication is available, standardised communications protocol reduces the time needed to convey necessary information and the error rate in transmission. Diving procedures generally involve the correct application of the appropriate diving skills in response to the current circumstances, and range from selecting and testing equipment to suit the diver and the dive plan, to the rescue of oneself or another diver in a life-threatening emergency. In many cases, what might be a life-threatening emergency to an untrained or inadequately skilled diver, is a mere annoyance and minor distraction to a skilled diver who applies the correct procedure without hesitation. Professional diving operations tend to adhere more rigidly to standard operating procedures than recreational divers, who are not legally or contractually obliged to follow them, but the prevalence of diving accidents is known to be strongly correlated to human error, which is more common in divers with less training and experience. The Doing It Right philosophy of technical diving is strongly supportive of common standard procedures for all members of a dive team, and prescribe the procedures and equipment configuration which may affect procedures to the members of their organisations. The terms diving skills and diving procedures are largely interchangeable, but a procedure may require the ordered application of several skills, and is a broader term. A procedure may also conditionally branch or require repeated applications of a skill, depending on circumstances. Diver training is structured around the learning and practice of standard procedures until the diver is assessed as competent to apply them reliably in reasonably foreseeable circumstances, and the certification issued limits the diver to environments and equipment that are compatible with their training and assessed skill levels. The teaching and assessment of diving skills and procedures is often restricted to registered instructors, who have been assessed as competent to teach and assess those skills by the certification or registration agency, who take the responsibility of declaring the diver competent against their assessment criteria. The teaching and assessment of other task oriented skills does not generally require a diving instructor. There is considerable difference in the diving procedures of professional divers, where a diving team with formally appointed members in specific roles and with recognised competence is required by law, and recreational diving, where in most jurisdictions the diver is not constrained by specific laws, and in many cases is not required to provide any evidence of competence. Diver training Commercial diver training in a alt=A group of about 12 divers on the shore of a flooded quarry preparing surface-supplied diving equipment for diver training exercises. Several umbilicals are laid out for use in figure 8 coils. Underwater diver training is normally given by a qualified instructor who is a member of one of many diver training agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables. Diving hand signals are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication. An entry level diver must learn the techniques of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at a high risk of drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder. To avoid injury during descent, divers must be competent at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; they must also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid decompression sickness, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion. Some knowledge of physiology and the physics of diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, decompression sickness, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks. Medical aspects of diving The medical aspects of diving and hyperbaric exposure include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, diagnosis and treatment of diving disorders, treatment by recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, toxic effects of gases in a hyperbaric environment, and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure. Fitness to dive Medical fitness to dive is the medical and physical suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes. Psychological fitness to dive is not normally evaluated before recreational or commercial diver training, but can influence the safety and success of a diving career. Diving medicine Military and commercial divers are trained in the procedures for use of a recompression chamber to treat diving disorders. Diving medicine is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects of pressure on gas filled spaces in and in contact with the body, and of partial pressures of breathing gas components, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive and the side effects of drugs used to treat other conditions affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric medicine is another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes the effect on the human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education. Risks and safety Risk is a combination of hazard, vulnerability and likelihood of occurrence, which can be the probability of a specific undesirable consequence of a hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of an activity. The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident and its probable direct consequences. Commercial diving operations may expose the diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational health and safety legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible. Statistics on injuries related to commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is responsible for the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. During 2006 to 2015 there were an estimated 306 million recreational dives made by US residents and 563 recreational diving deaths from this population. The fatality rate was 1.8 per million recreational dives, and 47 deaths for every 1000 emergency department presentations for scuba injuries. Scuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when the cause of death is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Where the triggering event is known, it is most commonly a shortage of breathing gas, followed by buoyancy problems. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data are poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety. Artisanal fishermen and gatherers of marine organisms in less developed countries may expose themselves to relatively high risk using diving equipment if they do not understand the physiological hazards, particularly if they use inadequate equipment. Diving hazards Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, which include strong water movement and local pressure differentials, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre- existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task. Human factors The major factors influencing diving safety are the environment, the diving equipment and the performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective of the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance. Human factors are the physical or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influence functioning of technological systems as well as human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, and the consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors are more likely to have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt. Human factors in diving equipment design is the influence of the interaction between the diver and the equipment on the design of the equipment on which the diver relies to stay alive and in reasonable comfort, and to perform the planned tasks during a dive. The design of the equipment can strongly influence its effectiveness in performing the desired functions. Divers vary considerably in anthropometric dimensions, physical strength, joint flexibility, and other physiological characteristics within the range of acceptable fitness to dive. Diving equipment should allow as full a range of function as reasonably practicable, and should be matched to the diver, the environment, and the task. Diving support equipment is usually shared by a wide range of divers, and must work for them all. The most difficult stages of a dive for recreational divers are out of water activities and transitions between water and the surface site such as carrying equipment on shore, exiting from water to boat and shore, surface swimming, and dressing into the equipment. Safety and reliability, adjustability to fit the individual, performance, and simplicity were rated the most important features for diving equipment by recreational divers. The professional diver is supported by a surface team, who are available to assist with the out-of-water activities to the extent necessary to reduce the risk associated with them to a level acceptable in terms of the governing regulations and codes of practice. Risk management Solo diver managing risk of breathing gas supply failure by carrying a bailout cylinder (slung at the diver's left side) Risk management is obtained by the usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they are an important part of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving. Legal aspects Inshore and inland commercial and military diving is regulated by legislation in many countries. Responsibility of the employer, client and diving personnel is specified in these cases; offshore commercial diving may take place in international waters, and is often done following the guidelines of a voluntary membership organisation such as the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), which publishes codes of accepted best practice which their member organisations are expected to follow. Recreational diver training and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by government in a subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes recreational diver training and dive leading for reward; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though non-specific health and safety legislation still applies. In Israel recreational diving activities are regulated by the Recreational Diving Act, 1979. The legal responsibility for recreational diving service providers is usually limited as far as possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of duty of care of recreational buddy divers is unclear and has been the subject of considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs. Economic aspects Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism. Motivations to travel for scuba diving are complex and may vary considerably during the diver's development and experience. Participation can vary from once off to multiple dedicated trips per year over several decades. The popular destinations fall into several groups, including tropical reefs, shipwrecks and cave systems, each frequented by its own group of enthusiasts, with some overlap. Customer satisfaction is largely dependent on the quality of services provided, and personal communication has a strong influence on the popularity of specific service providers in a region. Professional diving includes a wide range of applications, of varying economic impact. All of them are in support of specific sectors of industry, commerce, defence, or public service, and their economic impacts are closely related to their importance to the relevant sector, and their effects on the diving equipment manufacturing and support industries. The importance of diving to the scientific community is not well recorded, but analysis of publications shows that diving supports scientific research largely through efficient and targeted sampling. Ecological impact A diver at work on hull maintenance The environmental impact of recreational diving is the effects of diving tourism on the marine environment. Usually these are considered to be adverse effects, and include damage to reef organisms by incompetent and ignorant divers, but there may also be positive effects as the environment is recognised by the local communities to be worth more in good condition than degraded by inappropriate use, which encourages conservation efforts. During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Since the 1970s diving has changed from an elite activity to a more accessible recreation, marketed to a very wide demographic. To some extent better equipment has been substituted for more rigorous training, and the reduction in perceived risk has shortened minimum training requirements by several training agencies. Training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences. Recreational scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide, which has increased to about 23 million by 2016 at about one million per year. Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact. The ecological impact of commercial diving is a small part of the impact of the specific industry supported by the diving operations, as commercial diving is not done in isolation. In most cases the impact of diving operations is insignificant in comparison with the overall project. Underwater ships husbandry may be an exception to this general tendency, and specific precautions to limit ecological impact may be required. Several of these operations will release some quantity of harmful material into the water, particularly hull cleaning operations which will release antifouling toxins. Alien biofouling organisms may also be released during this process. Other forms of professional diving, such as scientific and archaeological dives, are either planned to minimise impact, or in the case of public safety and police diving, will usually have little intrinsic impact, and are generally considered necessary for sociological reasons in any case.

Although Orzabal had effectively made two solo albums under the Tears for Fears moniker in the 1990s (following the departure of bandmate Curt Smith), Elemental and Raoul and the Kings of Spain, this was the first recording to be released under his own name. This album was Orzabal's last to feature contributions from Alan Griffiths, who co-wrote most of the tracks on this album as well as the previous two Tears for Fears albums. The album was given a low-key release and did not chart, but earned some critical acclaim for its clever melding of pop songwriting and drum and bass, ambient techno and trip hop textures. Dan Gennoe claimed in Amazon.com's editorial review: \\"Solo album or not, Tomcats Screaming Outside is the best Tears for Fears album in a decade.\\" In a 2000 interview Orzabal commented on his influences for the album: \\"I started out with an absolute concrete vision of where I wanted to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach, with drum and bass/jungle...and I ended up with something that wasn't the original plan.\\" The US release of the album (on Gold Circle Records) had the unfortunate coincidence to be released on September 11, 2001 the same day the United States experienced its worst-ever terrorist attack, and drew little notice outside Tears for Fears' core fan base.

The population in 2011 was 1,939,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 21.51 km¬≤.√Åreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e pa√≠s History A curious legend attributes the name S√£o Jo√£o de Areias to the apparition of John the Baptist on the banks of the Mondego River. An old woman, upon seeing this vision yelled out Boa Nova! Boa Nova!, so the area was named Nova. Following public notice, the local residents proceeded in procession to their church. Being an image of John the Baptist and owing to the apparition occurring along the sandbank, the town started being referred to as S√£o Jo√£o de (or das) Areias (Saint John of the Sands). The town of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias was a municipal seat from 1514 to 1895, when its municipality was divided between Santa Comba D√£o and Carregal do Sal municipalities. The locality of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias, which had vila (town) status possibly since the Middle Ages, eventually lost that title after the extinction of its municipality. S√£o Jo√£o de Areias only recovered its title of town in the summer of 1997 (following the publication of Law 70/97). The area of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias was occupied since remote history, from archaeological evidence encountered throughout this region's history, including graves and vestiges of the Roman occupation. Documents from the 10th and 12th century identify the lands of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias as being donated by the Monastery of Lorv√£o to the S√© Cathedral of Coimbra and S√© Cathedral of Viseu. From this point forward the territory of this parish encompassed the towns of Silvares, S√£o Jo√£o de Areias and Parada. During the 18th and 19th centuries, S√£o Jo√£o de Areias was referred to in the Inquiries of Afonso III and other documents of the royal chancellery. At the beginning of the 16th century (10 April 1514 specifically) Manuel I conceded a foral (charter), resulting in the building of the pillory of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias. The regal population cadastral document for 1527, indicated that the municipality of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias included the parishes of S√£o Jo√£o and Parada. Silvares was the seat of a small municipality, alongside that of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias, where 25 inhabitants (13 in Silvares, eight in Casal and four in Venda [da Guarita]) had homes. Sometime between the 15th and 16th centuries there was a growth in the construction of religious buildings, that would repeat itself in the 18th century. Seven chapels were constructed during this epoch, and dedicated to S√£o Sebasti√£o, S√£o Pedro, S√£o Silvestre, S√£o Jo√£o Evangelista, Santo Ant√≥nio and S√£o Miguel, in addition to a chapel to Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa, and later the chapels dedicated to S√£o Jos√© and S√£o Francisco (no Casal). During the middle of the 17th century, the municipalities of S√£o Jo√£o de Areias and Silvares was composed of a municipality governed by Presiding Judge, Councilmen (three for S√£o Jo√£o de Areias and one for Silvares) and an attorney by district Magistrates letter and named His Majesty. This situation continued until the preceding centuries, until the municipality's extinction. Geography * S.

History  The Super class ferry was designed to supplement the Evergreen State Class, as well as to replace the aging Kalakala. The design of the Super Class was done in Seattle by W.C. Nickum and Sons, a Naval architectural firm, and the Washington State Ferries. Funding for the Super Class ferry design and construction was made available by the United States Housing and Urban Development agency, and state and federal funds. Once the design was complete, a low bid was accepted by National Steel and Shipbuilding company in San Diego, California, which constructed all four vessels over a period of two years.  Design  The design of the Super class was to accommodate the rapidly expanding population growth in Puget Sound, especially the Seattle/Bremerton/Bainbridge Island areas. Each vessel was to be rated at 20 knots top speed, which was relatively unheard of in large ferries at the time. All four vessels in the class feature a split-level passenger deck and a vast sun deck with full access via sheltered outdoor stairwells at both ends of the vessel, indoor staircases via both passenger decks, and elevators which were later added to meet ADA requirements. The first ferry to enter service, in 1967, was the M/V Hyak, which replaced the aging Kalakala on the Bremerton/Seattle run. The new 20-knot speed enabled the 16-mile crossing to be made in 45 minutes, as opposed to an hour and fifteen minutes on the Kalakala which traveled at a maximum of 12 knots. Second to enter service, on the Seattle/Bainbridge Island route was the M/V Kaleetan in 1968. The last two were the Yakima (Bremerton/Seattle) and Elwha (Seattle/Bainbridge), which entered service later that year.  Ferries  The Super Class consisted of four vessels. As of May 2020, two of those vessels are still in active service, and the other two have been retired.

The King of England authorized the Provincial President to give commissions to persons who shall be best qualified for regulating and discipline of the militia. President Cutt placed Major Richard Waldron of Dover in command of the Militia. In 1879, the Militia was designated by the state as the New Hampshire National Guard. History=Colonial era The New Hampshire Militia served in all of the Colonial Wars, and was part of expeditions that captured the Fortress of Louisbourg in 1745 and Port Royal, Nova Scotia in 1710. During the last four wars of the French and Indian Wars, the New Hampshire Militia furnished about 5,000 men for six different campaigns, including men who served with Major Robert Rogers and his Rangers. Regiments of the New Hampshire provincial soldiers were at the Battle of Lake George, the Siege of Fort William Henry, the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the 1758 Battle of Carillon and the fall of Fort Carillon (subsequently Fort Ticonderoga) in 1759, the Battle of the Plains of Abraham and the Battle of Sainte-Foy near Quebec, and were present at the final capitulation of New France at Montreal. They also saw action in countless small battles from the Hudson River to Nova Scotia. The Militia was also heavily involved in the American Revolution when it furnished men for the New Hampshire regiments in Washington's Continental Army. John Stark, an officer in Rogers' Rangers, raised the 1st New Hampshire Regiment and took it to the Siege of Boston in 1775 and fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, along with James Reed's 3rd New Hampshire Regiment. These two regiments along with Enoch Poor's 2nd New Hampshire Regiment entered service with the Continental Army and saw action all through the war. In 1777 John Stark led a force of 1,500 New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Vermont militia at the Battle of Bennington in a surprise attack against over 1,400 Hessian, British, Tory and Indians and won a stunning victory that helped the Continental Army win the Saratoga Campaign. Two New Hampshire militia regiments were at the Battle of Saratoga serving in Ebenezer Learned's Brigade helping to defeat General John Burgoyne. New Hampshire militia helped in Gen. John Sullivan's unsuccessful Battle of Rhode Island in 1778. Civil War era (1860-1880) At the beginning of the American Civil War the Militia was virtually nonexistent. The state had to raise volunteer regiments, such as the 6th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry, to aid in the war. In 1879, New Hampshire designated the Militia as the New Hampshire National Guard prior to the mandatory name change required by the National Defense Act of 1916.

First built in 1878, it overlooks Port Phillip from the Upper Esplanade, and is one of the oldest and grandest hotels in the city. Famed for its long history of live music, it was the subject of long community battles to maintain this heritage in the late 1990s.  History  The Esplanade Hotel circa 1885 The hotel was built in 1878 and remains one of the earliest, largest and most prominent 19th-century resort hotels in Victoria. Originally intended to be three large terraces, the building was altered to become a hotel during construction, and became one of the premier hotels in Melbourne outside the city. The Esplanade Hotel provided rooms overlooking Port Phillip Bay, at a time when St Kilda was both a suburb of the wealthy, and the preferred place to partake of the waters in one of the many sea-bath establishments for both Melburnians and visitors. The Esplanade Hotel was the home of wealthy philanthropist and National Gallery of Victoria benefactor Alfred Felton from 1892 until his death in 1904. The hotel also hosted many famous visitors, including Mark Twain in the 1880s, and actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1920. A large dining room (later known as the Gershwin Room) in the rear wing was redecorated in Art Nouveau style in c1910. In 1921 the hotel changed hands to become Carlyon‚Äôs Esplanade Hotel, and alterations were made changing it from exclusive residential use for the wealthy to incorporate entertainment for the middle classes. A ground level extension created a much larger lounge bar, and a grand staircase and entry was added. The \\"Eastern Tent Ballroom\\" was constructed to the rear of the site, and in the early 1920s became an important jazz and dance venue, at a time when the St Kilda foreshore area was one of the main entertainment districts in Melbourne, with numerous dance halls, cinemas, baths, hotels and an ice rink. It closed in 1925, and in 1929 the ballroom was rebuilt as the Spanish style Baymor Court flats. Col Jackson took on the lease in 1967 and heralded a new era in music at The Espy. In the 1970s the Gershwin Room was turned into a disco, complete with flashing Saturday Night Fever-style dance floor, and later hosted live bands, as did the front bar, dubbed the Nimrod Room. From the 70s and through the 1980s and 90s, live music on up to three stages was an almost every night occurrence, as the Espy became one of the major venues of Melbourne's vibrant live music scene. By the 1980s, the upper floor guest rooms had been abandoned, and by the 1990s the Baymor Court flats were unused as well. The Esplanade Hotel was classified by the National Trust of Australia in October 1990. The hotel was bought by Carlton and United Breweries in 1995 and then sold to Becton Corporation in 1997 with plans to develop a large residential and retail complex on the site. Becton's proposal for a 35 storey residential complex behind a partly retained hotel resulted in 9,000 residents registering objections and the trade union movement threatening to boycott construction if the pub was demolished. Community opposition supported the Espy's role in Melbourne culture and independent music scene. The eventual compromise was a lower 10 storey apartment building to the rear and side replacing rear wings, a yard, the Baymor Court flats and the bottle shop, separate from the main part of the hotel building. In 2001, Becton put out to tender the sale of a 200 year lease for the separated Espy Hotel. The community based Lewis/Comey/Esplanade Alliance bid was pipped by former nightclub operators Paul Adamo and Vince Sofo (who previously owned the popular Chevron nightclub in Chapel Street). Following some refurbishment the Gershwin Room at the rear reopened for live bands in 2004 and became home for the SBS television show Rockwiz. In 2006 the apartment development, designed by Fender Katsalidis, was completed. Adamo and Sofo attempted to sell the lease in early 2014, without success. They closed the hotel suddenly on 17 May 2015, with the stated intention of refurbishment, but no work happened, with only the Gershwin Room used occasionally for special gigs. In May 2017, The Espy was sold yet again, to Melbourne-based hospitality group Sand Hill Road, who have operated and redeveloped licensed venues since 2000. After an extensive renovation, a transformed Espy reopened in November 2018, with three live music or performance stages, numerous bars and restaurants, finally renovating and reusing all four floors, and the basement.  Music  The Esplanade Hotel is reputed to be the longest continuously running live music venue in Australia. In May 1995, Paul Kelly recorded tracks for his album, Live at the Continental and the Esplanade (1996), in the hotel's Gershwin Room. Since 2005, the SBS music quiz show RocKwiz has been filmed in the same room. Show host Julia Zemiro used to work at the hotel as a waitress.

After the acquisition of Conf√≠a, the businessman from Monterrey started an ambitious growth plan based on an aggressive marketing strategy and innovative marketing. Soon the green logo of Conf√≠a invaded billboards, pages of newspapers and magazines, television screens, soccer stadiums, baseball and even tennis courts.

It began training United States Army Air Corps flying cadets under contract to Southern Airways, Inc. and Southern Aviation Training School, Inc. It was assigned to Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command) as a primary (level 1) pilot training airfield. In addition, the school had had five local auxiliary airfields for emergency and overflow landings: * Harris Station Auxiliary Field * Anderson Auxiliary Field * Beaver Dam Auxiliary Field * Poole Auxiliary Field * Tanner Auxiliary Field (location undetermined) Flying training was performed with Fairchild PT-19s as the primary trainer. It also had several PT-17 Stearmans and a few P-40 Warhawks assigned. The airport was inactivated on December 28, 1944, with the drawdown of AAFTC's pilot training program. It was declared surplus and turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers on September 30, 1945. It was eventually discharged to the War Assets Administration (WAA) and became a civil airport. A newly built $1.8 million terminal building opened in 2008 at the north end of the field as part of a federally funded $3.3 million project. This also included lengthening the runway to to accommodate larger jets and improve safety.Pryor Field work ‚Äònearly finished‚Äô In January 2010, the pilot training site was designated a historic landmark and added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage.

They performed together for forty years until Kanchan died in 2004. Babla Shah is the younger brother of famous music director duo Kalyanji Anandji.https://scroll.in/reel/851569/for-disco-dandiya-pioneer- babla-it-has-always-been-about-the-beat Biography Babla was born as Laxmichand Shah, son of Virji Shah, into a Kutchi Hindu family of trading background. His family hailed from the village of Kundrodi in Kutch, Gujarat. His father had moved to Mumbai and set up a shop in Girgaum. The music director duo of Kalyanji and Anandji are Babla's elder brothers. Babla sang some songs for films and also tried his hand at music direction like his older brothers. According to film music expert Rajesh Subramanian, the song \\"Khaike Pan Banaraswala\\" was composed by Babla. He felt the need to differentiate himself from his famous brothers and he took up folk music-with-western- elements as his niche genre of music. He made this selection because he had a taste and talent for this type of hybrid music, as also a liking for live performance. He started his band in 1962, and the venture met with success. A form of traditional folk dance from the state of Gujarat called Dandiya Raas or Raas Garba was musically redefined (with western elements and instruments) by Shah in the 1970s. In 2011, Shah was awarded the Radio Mirchi Music Award for Outstanding Contribution to Hindi Film Music. Unfortunately, Kanchan was not there to cherish the moment. She had died in 2004. Today, Shah is a drummer, percussionist, live performing artist, composer and record producer. Kumari Kanchan Dinkerao Mail was born into a Hindu family of Marathi background. She was the daughter of Dinakar Rao Mail. She was a talented singer and her songs are there in the films Rafoo Chakkar, Dharmatma and Qurbani, all of whose music was scored by Kalyanji-Anandji. Kanchan's songs in these films included Kya Khoob Lagti Ho -- Phir Se kaho and Laila Oh Laila, which remain popular even today. Yet she did not get adequate recognition, despite the support of Babla's older brothers, and the reason was again (as with Babla) the need to differentiate her voice and style from that of other established singers. Perhaps for this reason, her career as a playback singer for Hindi films was rather limited. She distinguished herself by moving to the Bhojpuri language, a regional dialect of Hindi popular throughout the Indian diaspora of decedents of indentured laborers. She found greater success there. Her solo albums like Kaise Bani were popular with Bhojpuri audience. Her popularity even led to product endorsement deals for various consumer brands including Johnson & Johnson. She had meanwhile become close to Kalanji-Anandji and their family. She married Babla and joined her husband's troupe or band. The husband-wife duo performed and toured around the globe together. Their international engagements then kept them away from Hindi (Bollywood) film music, which they gradually abandoned. The decade of the 1980s was their heyday for live performances. They were mostly popular in Caribbean countries, where they covered soca hits like Hot Hot Hot. They also revived older hits by their chutney music predecessor singer Sundar Popo. Due to their extensive touring support, their LP albums including Kuch Gadbad Hai sold well for an Indian group traveling abroad. The dance music for these sensual folk dances came to be termed chutney music and is now recognized as a genre in itself. Songs Many songs Kanchan sang were remakes of older songs by West Indian locals, or were soca classics or by Sundar Popo from Trinidad. *\\"Kaise Bani\\" (originally by Sundar Popo) *\\"Chaadar Bechaow\\" (originally by Sundar Popo) *\\"Benji Darling\\" (originally by Neisha Benjamin) *\\"Ai Ai O\\" (\\"Buss Up Shot\\" by Baron) *\\"Kuch Garbar\\" Hai (\\"Hot Hot Hot\\" by Arrow) *\\"Tiny Winy\\" (\\"Tiny Winey\\" by Byron Lee & The Dragonaires) *\\"Kuch Kuch Baby\\" (\\"Rock It\\" by Merchant) *\\"Hum Na Jaibe\\" (originally by Sundar Popo) *\\"Na Manu\\" (originally by Bidjanwatie Chaitoe, Diamond Collection) *\\"Leggo Me Na Raja\\" (originally by Halima Bissoon) Family The couple has two children, daughter Nisha and son Vaibhav.

He later served a life sentence for hiring a hit man to murder his ex-wife, Mildred Horn, their disabled son Trevor, and nurse Janice Saunders. The case quickly gained national interest, and went on to prompt a lawsuit with Paladin Press, the publishers of a book, Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors, which had been used as a how-to manual by the killer.  Career  Horn gained experience working as a disc jockey on the USS Lake Champlain (CV-39)'s radio station. He began working with Motown Records in Detroit, during their heyday in the early 1960s as a sound engineer. He was the chief technician for artists such as The Temptations (\\"My Girl\\") and Junior Walker and the All-Stars (\\"Shotgun\\"). Horn left Motown in 1968 to join a company owned by former Motown songwriting team Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland, with which he stayed throughout the 1970s, until he left to become an independent producer. In 1983, he went back to Motown until he was laid off in 1990.  Personal life  After a brief one-year marriage to Motown receptionist Juana Royster in the late 1960s, Horn moved to Los Angeles with Motown where, in 1972, he met his second wife, Mildred Maree, during a first-class flight en route to Los Angeles. The couple married in Las Vegas in August 1973, but separated in 1979, and filed for divorce in 1981, although they continued a relationship afterwards via their daughter. In 1984, despite the ongoing divorce proceedings, Millie learned she was pregnant with twins by Horn. The couple divorced in 1987. Laid off by Motown in a 1990 sale and restructure, the once-prosperous Horn slid into debt, particularly with $16,000 () in overdue child support. On March 3, 1993, when the murders occurred, Horn's family consisted of: * Mildred \\"Millie\\" Horn (born November 8, 1949) ‚Äì born in South Carolina in a family of 14 children; senior flight attendant with American Airlines; moved to Maryland in 1979. * Tiffani (born 1974) ‚Äì college freshman; was away at Howard University on the night of the attack. * Tamielle ‚Äì (born August 8, 1984) ‚Äì twin; was staying nearby with her aunt, Millie's sister Vivian, on the night of the attack. * Trevor ‚Äì (born August 8, 1984) ‚Äì twin; severely disabled and required continual nursing care. He was being cared for by an emergency substitute nurse, Janice Saunders (aged 38).  Murder case  By late 1992, Horn had befriended James Perry, via his cousin, Thomas Turner, and contracted him to kill his ex-wife, disabled 8-year-old son, and the family's overnight nurse in their Layhill, Silver Spring, Maryland, home. The murders were carried out after 2:00am on March 3, 1993. Both women (Horn and Saunders) had been shot multiple times in the head, and Trevor had been smothered by the killer placing one hand over his tracheostoma and the other hand over his nose and mouth. Attempts had been made to portray the crime as a robbery gone wrong. Millie's sister, Vivian (who lived half a block away) and another neighbor discovered the bodies around 7:30am on March 3, 1993. The motive for hiring Detroit-based Perry to commit the murders was that Horn stood to gain $1.7 million ($ million in ) from his son's trust fund, established after the settlement of a lawsuit resulting from a medical procedure on September 16, 1986 (when he was nearly two years old) that left Trevor with brain damage and quadriplegic. The death of his ex-wife also meant that Horn would be the sole beneficiary of the fund. Perry was sentenced to death in 1995 for the murders, and in 1996, Lawrence Horn was found guilty on three counts of first-degree murder and one count of murder conspiracy and sentenced to life imprisonment. The case prompted a lawsuit in 1997 against Paladin Press, the publishers of Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors, which James Perry had used as a guide to execute the murders. The lawsuit was settled in 1999, when the publishers agreed to stop selling the book and pay millions of dollars in compensation to the families of the victims. Later, Perry's conviction was overturned by an appeals court, and a second trial in 2001 sentenced him to three life terms in Maryland's prison system. Perry died of an undisclosed illness in prison on December 30, 2009. Horn died in prison in February 2017.  Media  In October 1999, Discovery Channel's The FBI Files aired a season two episode on the case, with interviews by investigators and original crime footage, called \\"Hired Gun\\". The same year, a book called Deliberate Intent: A lawyer tells the true story of murder by the book, and based on court case against Paladin Press, was released by lawyer, author, and First Amendment scholar Rod Smolla. In 2000, a television film called Deliberate Intent, directed by Andy Wolk, was made based on the book. In September 2017, the case appeared in season one of TV series called Shattered in an episode called \\"Sins of the Father.\\" Horn's complicity in orchestrating the hit against his son for personal gain was also detailed by Casefile True Crime Podcast in September 2018. The A&E; program American Justice covered the murders in the episode \\"Blueprint for A Murder\\", which aired in January 2000. In August 2019, Stuff Media launched a new podcast, Hitman. It focused on Lawrence Horn and his involvement in the murders of Trevor Horn, Mildred \\"Millie\\" Horn, and Janice Saunders. It also discussed how James Perry used the book Hit Man as a reference to commit and get away with murder.

He later coached Atl√©tico Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid. During his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 184 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Su√°rez, L√°szl√≥ Kubala, C√©sar, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the midfield general role and was nicknamed Surrealista (The Surrealist) and Home Magosta (The Grasshopper Man) due to his style. As a manager, he led Barcelona to a title in La Liga in 1945, and as a scout he recruited another Barcelona legend, L√°szl√≥ Kubala. However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di St√©fano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di St√©fano affair, twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco, Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona. When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou. Club career=Early life Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Samitier played as a junior for FC Internacional before, at the age of 17, he made his debut for FC Barcelona in 1919. As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqu√©s, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dal√≠. FC Barcelona By 1925 Samitier was the highest paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alc√°ntara, Ricardo Zamora, F√©lix Ses√∫maga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928. Madrid CF In 1933 an aging Samiter found himself in dispute with the FC Barcelona management and he was dropped from the first team. Real Madrid, then known as Madrid CF, were quick to take advantage of the situation. Samitier was reunited with both his friend Ricardo Zamora and then Francisco Bru. Although his career with the Madrid club was short, he did help them win a title in La Liga 1932‚Äì33 and the Copa de Espa√±a in 1934. Exile in France In 1936 Samitier made a brief start to his career as a coach. He succeeded Fred Pentland at Atl√©tico Madrid in the middle of the season, but failed to prevent them from being relegated. However Samitier‚Äôs new career and Atl√©tico's relegation were postponed with the start of the Spanish Civil War. He found himself arrested by an anarchist militia, but was eventually released and left for France on a warship. His escape was later used by the Nationalist side in an account printed in Marca. In October 1936 he joined OGC Nice as a player, where he was reunited once again with Ricardo Zamora. He subsequently scored 47 goals in 82 matches for the French team. He eventually retired as a player in 1939 and was briefly coach at OGC Nice in 1942. Return to Barcelona Samiter returned to Spain and became manager of CF Barcelona in 1944. In 1945 he guided them to only their second ever La Liga title. They then beat the Copa del General√≠simo winners Atl√©tico Bilbao to win the Copa de Oro Argentina. Samiter subsequently worked as the clubs chief scout and was instrumental in the recruitment of another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala. In the summer of 1950 Kubala arrived in Spain with his own team, Hungaria. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. They played a series of friendlies against a Madrid Select XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espa√±ol. During these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Samitier. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was then persuaded by Samitier to sign for CF Barcelona. It has been suggested that Samitier used his connections within Francoist Spain to help arrange the transfer. In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala‚Äôs escape to the West was used by Francoist Spain and was made into a film The Stars Search for Peace which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves. International career In 1920 together with Ricardo Zamora, F√©lix Ses√∫maga, Pichichi and Jos√© Mar√≠a Belauste, Samitier was also a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games. He subsequently made 21 appearances and scored 2 goals for Spain. Samitier also played at least 21 games and scored at least 15 goals for the Catalan XI. However records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played and scored more. Together with Paulino Alc√°ntara, Sagibarba and Ricardo Zamora he helped the Catalan XI win an inter-regional competition, the Copa Princep de Asturies, three times during the 1920s. In the 1924 final he scored twice in a 4‚Äì4 draw against a Castile XI and scored again in the 3‚Äì2 replay. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 19 January 1936 at the Les Corts. He scored in a 1‚Äì1 draw with SK Sidenice of Czechoslovakia.

At Google Books. It was defined as the meridian (north‚Äìsouth) line from the eighty-second milestone of the Pennsylvania‚ÄìNew York survey line at 76¬∞ 57' 58\\" W northward to Lake Ontario.  Origin and definition  By coincidence, the Preemption Line is near the meridian of the Capitol at Washington (77¬∞ 00' 33\\" W of Greenwich), but the popular assumption that the Preemption Line was intended to be on that meridian seems to be a myth, since the District of Columbia had not been surveyed at the time of the 1786 treaty; in fact Benjamin Ellicott helped map and survey the District of Columbia in 1791‚Äì1792 and then re-surveyed the Preemption line in 1792 (see below). The word \\"preemption\\" refers to the pre-emptive right that Massachusetts received to negotiate with the native sovereign tribes‚Äîpre-empting New York State, and also to the pre-emptive rights of the two state governments with respect to individuals, who were forbidden to negotiate directly with the sovereign tribes without first securing a patent from the respective legislature.

The Old and New Preemption Lines  A portion of a map of the State of New York, by Simon Dewitt (1804) with the old preemption line emphasized in red, and the new preemption line emphasized in green. An interesting point is that there are two pre-emption lines: the Old and New (to the east of the Old); the area between is called the Gore (referring to a dressmaker's term for a wedge- shaped piece). This is because very soon after the original survey of 1788 it was suspected that this survey was in error, so a resurvey was commissioned in 1792. It showed that the first surveyors had used defective methods (or, as some allege but not proved fraudulent methods) so that the line, although beginning at the correct Pennsylvania boundary stone, was deflected about 2¬∞ west of north, hence the wedge shape (increasing in width to the north). It is not a simple error, however; once the survey was about two miles west of the correct line it then ran closer to true north. The original error was in favor of New York, which issued titles in the Gore; most notably, the current city of Geneva was incorrectly assigned. The new survey was accepted, as it was performed with a high-precision German transit by Benjamin Ellicott, who had just assisted in the initial survey of the District of Columbia (see Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia).(1) (2) \\"Benjamin Ellicott\\" in (3) The magnitude of the error can be appreciated at Geneva: the true (new) line is at about the midpoint of Seneca Lake at the Seneca‚ÄìOntario County boundary, whereas the false (old) line is the present-day Pre-emption Road, which forms the western limits of the City of Geneva, about two miles west.  The Preemption Lines on the ground today  Both begin at the same point: the eighty-second milestone of the Pennsylvania‚ÄìNew York survey line, located on Widger Hill Road near Millerton, PA at .  Old Preemption Line  There is no trace of this line south of Schuyler County, probably because no settlement took place in this area prior to the resurvey. In Schuyler County it forms the west line of the town of Reading, for most of this length along Pre-emption Road. It continues as the short north-south portion of the boundary between Schuyler (west) and Yates Counties along this road, and then divides the Yates County towns of Barrington (west) and Starkey (east) to their tri-point with the town of Milo, where the road also ends. A portion of road through Milo Center to the Keuka Lake outlet is on the line. It is marked again in Ontario County by the Pre-emption Road through the towns of Geneva and Phelps; this road makes some local deviations from the line. The Pre-emption Road continues a short distance into Wayne County as far as the new Erie Canal; it is not marked farther north.  New Preemption Line  This line forms the boundary between Chemung (east) and Steuben (west) Counties as well as a small north- south portion of the border between Chemung (east) and Schuyler (west) Counties at the former's northwest corner near Beaver Dams. It then forms the line between the towns of Orange (west) and Montour (east) in Schuyler County; the only roads that follows the line in this section are at the very beginning north a few miles on Widget Hill Road, and a mile of Locust Lane in Sugar Hill State Forest. The line has no trace in Yates County; it runs north-south through Seneca Lake from a point north of Dresden. It next appears at the north end of Seneca Lake and forms the boundary between Seneca (east) and Ontario (west) Counties to the tri-point with Wayne County; in this section it forms Pre-emption Road and most of West Town Line Road. In Wayne County it continues north as the line between the towns of Lyons and Sodus (west) and Galen, Rose and Huron (east); small sections of roadway denote its path. The line then runs through and terminates in Lake Ontario's Sodus Bay.

He founded the academic discipline of Social Administration (now largely known in universities as Social Policy) and held the founding chair in the subject at the London School of Economics. His books and articles of the 1950s helped to define the characteristics of Britain's post World War II welfare state and of a universal welfare society, in ways that parallel the contributions of Alva Myrdal and Gunnar Myrdal in Sweden. He is honoured in the Richard Titmuss Chair in Social Policy at the LSE, which is currently held by Julian Le Grand. Titmuss's association with eugenics extended beyond the British Eugenics Society, to encompass other personal and intellectual connections. He is also honoured by the annual Richard Titmuss Memorial Lecture in the Paul Baerwald School of Social Work at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. Biography Titmuss was born in 1907, the second child of a farmer; he was brought up in the countryside and left school at 14 with no formal qualifications. An autodidact, he worked for a large insurance company as an actuary for 16 years whilst simultaneously pursuing an interest in social topics through reading, debating and writing. His initial concerns were with such issues as insurance and the age structure of the population, migration, unemployment and re-armament, foreign policy and the peace movement. In 1938 he published Poverty and Population, which focused on the regional differences between the North and South. In 1939, he published Our Food Problem. Around this time, Titmuss was also active in the British Eugenics Society. In 1942, he was recruited to write a volume in the civil series of the official war history, Problems of Social Policy, a work which established his reputation as well as securing him the new chair at the London School of Economics. In this process, he was strongly supported by the sociologist T. H. Marshall. At the LSE, where he was the first professor of Social Administration, he transformed the teaching of social work and social workers and established Social Policy as an academic discipline. He also contributed to a number of government committees on the health service and social policy. He also did some consulting in Africa, sometimes together with Professor Brian Abel-Smith, who was later his successor in his chair. His concerns focused especially on issues of social justice. His final and perhaps the most important book, The Gift Relationship expressed his own philosophy of altruism in social and health policy and, like much of his work, emphasized his preference for the values of public service over private or commercial forms of care. The book was influential and resulted in a study of the blood bank systems, specifically with regard to regulation on the private blood market exchange. President Nixon called for a complete study of the lack of coordination within the system only months following publication of Titmuss' findings. He has been criticized by Kenneth Arrow for a somewhat poor reading of some sociological classics (though he never claimed to be a sociologist), such as the works of √âmile Durkheim; while this may partly reflect his somewhat inadequate academic training, it also derives from his impatience with non-participatory sociology and his preference (this became a defining characteristic of \\"his\\" discipline of 'social administration') for engagement with contemporary social policy issues and even some of its more fallible institutions. For example, he was much criticised for his role as a vice- chairman of the government's Supplementary Benefits Commission which some critics felt did not allow him enough distance. He, by contrast argued in favour of trying to make inadequate institutions work better for the benefit of the poor even if his involvement with them had the potential to sully the purity of his reputation. He held his chair from 1950, after brief spells in the Cabinet Office and the Social Medicine Research Unit, until his death in 1973. Influence Some of his works are still read and some have been re- printed in newly edited forms exploring their contemporary relevance. Many of the writings for which he is known were actually delivered as lectures at the LSE or when he was a much sought-after public speaker. Although several of these were later assembled as 'readers' or 'essays', he never completed a summary of his work or philosophy nor wrote a single magnum opus on social policy. Consequently there remains some confusion in secondary literature on his precise perspective on key issues, either of sociology or public policy. The Richard Titmuss Professor of Social Policy was established after his death. Like Titmuss, its current holder, Professor Julian Le Grand has been a government adviser on health policy. However, his emphasis on the potential for the private or quasi markets within the NHS differs markedly from that of Titmuss who strongly believed in the state and universal services that were allocated exclusively on the basis of needs (instead of income or prestige). Personal life The grave of Titmuss and his wife, Kay, in Highgate Cemetery. He married Kathleen (\\"Kay\\") Miller, a social worker.

History The game was originally planned as a port of the ZX Spectrum video game Stop the Express (later released for the Commodore 64 and MSX), which was released by Sinclair Research Ltd in 1983. Stop the Express only contained the first train level, and 3 levels were added for the release of Challenger. The game's title screen displays the slogan \\"Realtime Action Adventure.\\" The game is uniquely constructed, where the levels consist of a side-scrolling platform game, a top-view scrolling shooting game, and a fixed-screen action game. The game was also unique for its 100-screen map, which was extensive for its time. The game has been re-released as a mobile phone application, and was made available on the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console for 500 Wii Points in May, 2007 and the 3DS Virtual Console in March 2013.https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/50010000013297https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_clg/ The game was also coupled with Milon's Secret Castle ( in Japan) and released for the Game Boy Advance as part of Hudson Best Collection Vol. 3 Action Collection compilation on December 22, 2005. A Mobile version was released in 2005 with several changes in gameplay. Plot The title character, Challenger, is an archaeologist who seeks to rescue the princess, Maria, from the hands of the evil boss, Don Waldorado, in the land called Pleasio Land. The setting of the character as an archaeologist is an homage to the Indiana Jones franchise, while his name may be an allusion to Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger (best known for his appearance in The Lost World). The scene in the first level where the princess is taken away by the villain is programmed as part of the level, and it is impossible to catch up to the princess no matter how quickly the player progresses. The background music for this level is an arranged version of the well-known military march by Franz Schubert. Gameplay The player controls the main character, Challenger, and must head towards the goal in each level. The player can attack by throwing knives, but some enemies are invulnerable to this attack, and require a power-up item or the assistance of a hidden character to defeat. In levels 1, 3, and 4, touching any of the enemies results in a loss. The player can jump in the side-scrolling scenes, and can also duck by pressing down on the keypad in the first level. In most other games, the A button is used to jump, and the B button is used to attack, but in Challenger, the controls are reversed, where the A button causes the character to attack, and the B button causes them to jump. The player also falls off the train and loses if they throw a knife while they are on the connecting area between train cars. A life gauge is used only during the second level. The player receives damage whenever they touch enemies, and loses only when their life gauge reaches zero. There is no jump button for the top-view level, but the player can venture across the island to search for items. A timer is displayed on the upper left corner of the screen during all of the levels, and the player also loses a life when this timer reaches zero. Falling off of very high places or getting caught in traps also results in a loss, and the player is taken to the game over screen when there are no lives remaining. Difficulty The player can also choose the game's difficulty from 16 different settings on the title screen. The number of enemies decreases for lower level settings. However, the player must defeat certain special enemies in order to gain items required to complete some levels, and the decreased number of enemies on the lower difficulty settings actually makes it more difficult to finish the game. Therefore, the lowest setting is not necessarily the easiest difficulty setting. Levels Screenshot of the \\"Stop the Express\\" level in Challenger. The first level (or \\"scene\\") is titled \\"STOP THE EXPRESS!\\". The villain, Don Waldorado, has abducted Princess Maria, and is escaping on a special express train. Challenger heads for the front train car while avoiding Waldorado's cronies, but Waldorado cuts off the connection between the rear train cars and escapes after pushing Challenger off the train. The second level is titled \\"SEARCH PRINCESS!\\". The challenger arrives at Waldorado island in search of the princess, and ventures through an extensive 4-directional scrolling game map. Entering certain caves or buildings allows the player to advance to the third and fourth levels, but others may be dangerous trap zones which can cause instant death. The third level is titled \\"GET KEYWORD!\\". The princess is now being held captive in a pyramid, and Challenger must gather the three keyword items (a key, a ring, and a crown) that are spread throughout the third level in order to enter the pyramid. The level takes place in the inside of a cave, where Challenger must use the gushing fountains of water as steps to cross over to the other side. There are several entrances to level 3 located on Waldorado island, so the player can head for the pyramid by going back and forth between the second and third levels. The fourth and final level is titled \\"RESCUE PRINCESS!\\". Challenger arrives at the pyramid after collecting the three key items, and must jump across several dinosaur-shaped rocks to reach the top floor, where he will face Don Waldorado in the final battle. The player returns to the first level after the conclusion of the fourth level, and the game's difficulty increases by 2 settings. Enemies ; :The main antagonist of the game is the leader of an evil secret organization called Bloody Whacker, and abducts Princess Maria in the first level. He is impossible to defeat in his first appearance on the express train (touching Waldorado on this level does not result in damage). Challenger must defeat him in the final showdown in level 4, where he can be defeated with four throwing knives. ; :These large bird-like enemies appear in all 4 levels, and can be killed with throwing knives. They appear on difficulty settings above 3 for levels 1, 2, and 4, and difficulty settings above 9 for level 3. ; :These enemies are small automobiles with propellers which appear in the first level. They travel alongside the train, and suddenly rise up into the air. They cannot be defeated by throwing knives, but only appear for difficulty settings above 9. ; :These enemies are thunder clouds which occasionally attack by transforming into lightning bolts. They are not affected by throwing knives, and the background music changes when they appear in level 1. They appear on difficulty settings above 3 for level 1, and difficulty settings above 9 for level 3. There is no animation for when these enemies are killed, so when the character touches them while invincible in the first level, they turn into the skeleton enemy before disappearing. ; :These bearded enemies appear in levels 1 and 2, and wear distinct green clothing. They can be killed with throwing knives, and appear for difficulty settings above 3 for both levels. ; :These enemies are fireballs that appear on all of the levels (but not on level 3 for difficulty settings below 2). They cannot be killed with throwing knives. ; :These rabbit-like enemies are fairies wearing helmets. They can be killed with throwing knives, and only appear on level 2 for difficulty settings above 3. ; :These enemies are yellow, roundish robots. They can be killed with throwing knives, and only appear on level 2 for difficulty settings above 3. ; :These enemies are shaped like animal skulls. They can be killed with throwing knives, and only appear on level 2 for difficulty settings above 3. ; :These enemies are walking plants that eat humans. They can be killed with throwing knives, and only appear on level 2 for difficulty settings above 3. ; :These skeletons appear in level 2, where they guard the entrances to the third and fourth levels by passing back and forth quickly in front of the entrance. They cannot be killed by throwing knives, and the player will lose a life regardless of their remaining health if they come in contact with them. However, it is possible to avoid them by slipping into the entrance at the right timing. They only appear for difficulty settings above 3. Items, objects, and traps ; :These whales' names are a play on (the Japanese name for the sperm whale), and appears above certain water surfaces in level 2. Challenger's life gauge refills while they appear on screen, and they can also be killed off with the throwing knife for 400 bonus points (they are resurrected if the player scrolls away from the area). They are treated as enemy characters in the game's memory, and count towards the kill count needed to obtain the power sword and power jewel items. For difficulty settings below 2, the only enemies that appear on level 2 are the invincible fireballs, so the only way to obtain the items are to continue killing the whales. A hovering whale can also appear in level 2, and killing this whale awards the player an extra life. Killing the hovering whale in level 1 causes Challenger to become invincible. ;Power-up items :A power sword or power jewel appears in level 2 if the player kills 4 enemies in a row without missing with a knife shot. Challenger can obtain the item by hitting it with a knife, but he will receive damage if he comes in direct contact with the item. Obtaining the power sword causes Challenger's sprite color to change for a short period of time, during which his walking speed increases, and he gains the ability to kill any of the enemies on the screen with his throwing knives. Obtaining the power jewel causes all of the enemies on the screen to die instantaneously. The skeleton enemy that guards the entrances to levels 3 and 4 is impervious to throwing knives, so either one of the power-up items must be obtained in order to advance to the next levels. Like the Matt≈çkujira, the power-up items also cause the player's life gauge to refill as long as they remain visible on screen. ;Mystery zone :This trap area is a small, square-shaped zone with four holes. Stepping into any of the holes results in an instant loss. The background music changes when the player enters this area, and they can only escape using the power sword item. ; :The name of this trap area is the romanized Japanese word for the antlion. The trap area has a large vortex pattern on the floor, which drags the player towards the center. Falling into the center hole results in a loss of one life. The background music changes when the player enters this area, and they can only escape using the power sword item. ;Trap island :A fake pyramid is located on this island. Entering the fake pyramid results in a loss of one life. Mobile version An i-appli mobile application version of Challenger was released on August 1, 2005 for cellphones supporting i-appli in Japan. The game is currently available on the EZweb network as well. There are two modes in the mobile version; a classic mode, which is identical to the Famicom version of the game, and the arranged mode, which features improved graphics and character design along with several changes in gameplay. The changes from the classic mode to the arranged version are as follows: *The difficulty settings were decreased from 16 settings to 3 settings. *Conversation scenes are shown between characters in-between levels. *Challenger has a life gauge for all of the levels, meaning he cannot die from a single hit from an enemy. *The level 2 game map was completely remade, and the player may view the map in the game's sub menu. *Challenger can move in the diagonal direction for the top-view second level, and Challenger can throw knives while jumping in the three other levels. The jump-throw motion is required to defeat the arranged version's Waldorado. *Waldorado is tougher and sports several new attack patterns in the arranged version. Hitting Waldorado several times causes him to change color and fly, and the player must throw knives while jumping in order to hit the flying Waldorado. *An ending screen is added instead of the level-cycle loop of the classic version. *A save option was added to both the arranged version and classic version.

Some historians have defined this table as being the start of the chemical revolution. The chemical revolution, also called the first chemical revolution, was the early modern reformulation of chemistry that culminated in the law of conservation of mass and the oxygen theory of combustion. During the 19th and 20th century, this transformation was credited to the work of the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier (the \\"father of modern chemistry\\").The First Chemical Revolution ‚Äì the Instrument Project, The College of Wooster However, recent work on the history of early modern chemistry considers the chemical revolution to consist of gradual changes in chemical theory and practice that emerged over a period of two centuries. The so-called scientific revolution took place during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries whereas the chemical revolution took place during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Primary factors  Several factors led to the first chemical revolution. First, there were the forms of gravimetric analysis that emerged from alchemy and new kinds of instruments that were developed in medical and industrial contexts. In these settings, chemists increasingly challenged hypotheses that had already been presented by the ancient Greeks. For example, chemists began to assert that all structures were composed of more than the four elements of the Greeks or the eight elements of the medieval alchemists. The Irish alchemist, Robert Boyle, laid the foundations for the Chemical Revolution, with his mechanical corpuscular philosophy, which in turn relied heavily on the alchemical corpuscular theory and experimental method dating back to pseudo-Geber. Earlier works by chemists such as Jan Baptist van Helmont helped to shift the belief in theory that air existed as a single element to that of one in which air existed as a composition of a mixture of distinct kinds of gasses. Van Helmont's data analysis also suggests that he had a general understanding of the law of conservation of mass in the 17th century. Furthermore, work by Jean Rey in the early 17th century with metals like tin and lead and their oxidation in the presence of air and water helped pinpoint the contribution and existence of oxygen in the oxidation process. Other factors included new experimental techniques and the discovery of 'fixed air' (carbon dioxide) by Joseph Black in the middle of the 18th century. This discovery was particularly important because it empirically proved that 'air' did not consist of only one substance and because it established 'gas' as an important experimental substance. Nearer the end of the 18th century, the experiments by Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley further proved that air is not an element and is instead composed of several different gases. Lavoisier also translated the names of chemical substance into a new nomenclatural language more appealing to scientists of the nineteenth century. Such changes took place in an atmosphere in which the industrial revolution increased public interest in learning and practicing chemistry. When describing the task of reinventing chemical nomenclature, Lavoisier attempted to harness the new centrality of chemistry by making the rather hyperbolic claim that:  Precision instruments  Much of the reasoning behind Antoine Lavoisier being named the \\"father of modern chemistry\\" and the start of the chemical revolution lay in his ability to mathematize the field, pushing chemistry to use the experimental methods utilized in other \\"more exact sciences.\\" Lavoisier changed the field of chemistry by keeping meticulous balance sheets in his research, attempting to show that through the transformation of chemical species the total amount of substance was conserved. Lavoisier used instrumentation for thermometric and barometric measurements in his experiments, and collaborated with Pierre Simon de Laplace in the invention of the calorimeter, an instrument for measuring heat changes in a reaction. In attempting to dismantle phlogiston theory and implement his own theory of combustion, Lavoisier utilized multiple apparatuses. These included a red-hot iron gun barrel which was designed to have water run through it and decompose, and an alteration of the apparatus which implemented a pneumatic trough at one end, a thermometer, and a barometer. The precision of his measurements was a requirement in convincing opposition of his theories about water as a compound, with instrumentation designed by himself implemented in his research. Despite having precise measurements for his work, Lavoisier faced a large amount of opposition in his research. Proponents of phlogiston theory, such as Keir and Priestley, claimed that demonstration of facts was only applicable for raw phenomena, and that interpretation of these facts did not imply accuracy in theories. They stated that Lavoisier was attempting to impose order on observed phenomena, whereas a secondary source of validity would be required to give definitive proof of the composition of water and non-existence of phlogiston.  Antoine Lavoisier  The latter stages of the revolution was fuelled by the 1789 publication of Lavoisier's Trait√© √âl√©mentaire de Chimie (Elements of Chemistry). Beginning with this publication and others to follow, Lavoisier synthesised the work of others and coined the term \\"oxygen\\". Antoine Lavoisier represented the chemical revolution not only in his publications, but also in the way he practiced chemistry. Lavoisier's work was characterized by his systematic determination of weights and his strong emphasis on precision and accuracy. While it has been postulated that the law of conservation of mass was discovered by Lavoisier, this claim has been refuted by scientist Marcellin Berthelot. Earlier use of the law of conservation of mass has been suggested by Henry Guerlac, noting that scientist Jan Baptist van Helmont had implicitly applied the methodology to his work in the 16th and 17th centuries. Earlier references of the law of conservation of mass and its use were made by Jean Rey in 1630. Although the law of conservation of mass was not explicitly discovered by Lavoisier, his work with a wider array of materials than what most scientists had available at the time allowed his work to greatly expand the boundaries of the principal and its fundamentals. Lavoisier also contributed to chemistry a method of understanding combustion and respiration and proof of the composition of water by decomposition into its constituent parts. He explained the theory of combustion, and challenged the phlogiston theory with his views on caloric. The Trait√© incorporates notions of a \\"new chemistry\\" and describes the experiments and reasoning that led to his conclusions. Like Newton's Principia, which was the high point of the Scientific Revolution, Lavoisier's Trait√© can be seen as the culmination of the Chemical Revolution. Lavoisier's work was not immediately accepted and it took several decades for it gain momentum. This transition was aided by the work of J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius, who came up with a simplified shorthand to describe chemical compounds based on John Dalton's theory of atomic weights. Many people credit Lavoisier and his overthrow of phlogiston theory as the traditional chemical revolution, with Lavoisier marking the beginning of the revolution and John Dalton marking its culmination.  M√©thode de nomenclature chimique  Antoine Lavoisier, in a collaborative effort with Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine Fran√ßois de Fourcroy, published M√©thode de nomenclature chimique in 1787. This work established a terminology for the \\"new chemistry\\" which Lavoisier was creating, which focused on a standardized set of terms, establishment of new elements, and experimental work. M√©thode established 55 elements which were substances that could not be broken down into simpler composite parts at the time of publishing. By introducing new terminology into the field, Lavoisier encouraged other chemists to adopt his theories and practices in order to use his terms and stay current in chemistry.  Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de chimie  One of Lavoisier's main influences was √âtienne Bonnet, abb√© de Condillac. Condillac's approach to scientific research, which was the basis of Lavoisier's approach in Trait√©, was to demonstrate that human beings could create a mental representation of the world using gathered evidence. In Lavoisier's preface to Trait√©, he states > It is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every branch > of knowledge, that, in the progress of investigation, we should proceed from > known facts to what is unknown. ... In this manner, from a series of > sensations, observations, and analyses, a successive train of ideas arises, > so linked together, that an attentive observer may trace back to a certain > point the order and connection of the whole sum of human knowledge.Antoine- > Laurent Lavoisier, Elements of Chemistry, trans. Robert Kerr (Edinburgh, > 1790; facs. reprint New York: Dover, 1965), pp. xv-xvi. Lavoisier clearly ties his ideas in with those of Condillac, seeking to reform the field of chemistry. His goal in Trait√© was to associate the field with direct experience and observation, rather than assumption. His work defined a new foundation for the basis of chemical ideas and set a direction for the future course of chemistry.  Humphry Davy  Humphry Davy was an English chemist and a professor of chemistry at the London's Royal Institution in the early 1800s. There he performed experiments that cast doubt upon some of Lavoisier's key ideas such as the acidity of oxygen and the idea of a caloric element. Davy was able to show that acidity was not due to the presence of oxygen using muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) as proof. He also proved that the compound oxymuriatic acid contained no oxygen and was instead an element, which he named chlorine. Through his use of electric batteries at the Royal Institution Davy first isolated chlorine, followed by the isolation of elemental iodine in 1813. Using the batteries Davy was also able to isolate the elements sodium and potassium. From these experiments Davy concluded that the forces that join chemical elements together must be electrical in nature. Davy was also a proponent against the idea that caloric was an immaterial fluid, arguing instead that heat was a type of motion.  John Dalton  John Dalton was an English chemist who developed the idea of atomic theory of chemical elements. Dalton's atomic theory of chemical elements assumed that each element had unique atoms associated with and specific to that atom. This was in opposition to Lavoisier's definition of elements which was that elements are substances that chemists could not break down further into simpler parts. Dalton's idea also differed from the idea of corpuscular theory of matter, which believed that all atoms were the same, and had been a supported theory since the 17th century. To help support his idea, Dalton worked on defining the relative weights of atoms in chemicals in his work New System of Chemical Philosophy, published in 1808. His text showed calculations to determine the relative atomic weights of Lavoisier's different elements based on experimental data pertaining to the relative amounts of different elements in chemical combinations. Dalton argued that elements would combine in the simplest form possible. Water was known to be a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, thus Dalton believed water to be a binary compound containing one hydrogen and one oxygen. Dalton was able to accurately compute the relative quantity of gases in atmospheric air. He used the specific gravity of azotic (nitrogen), oxygenous, carbonic acid (carbon dioxide), and hydrogenous gases as well as aqueous vapor determined by Lavoisier and Davy to determine the proportional weights of each as a percent of a whole volume of atmospheric air. Dalton determined that atmospheric air contains 75.55% azotic gas, 23.32% oxygenous gas, 1.03% aqueous vapor, and 0.10% carbonic acid gas.  J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius  J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius was a Swedish chemist who studied medicine at the University of Uppsala and was a professor of chemistry in Stockholm. He drew on the ideas of both Davy and Dalton to create an electrochemical view of how elements combined together. Berzelius classified elements into two groups, electronegative and electropositive depending which pole of a galvanic battery they were released from when decomposed. He created a scale of charge with oxygen being the most electronegative element and potassium the most electropositive. This scale signified that some elements had positive and negative charges associated with them and the position of an element on this scale and the element's charge determined how that element combined with others. Berzelius's work on electrochemical atomic theory was published in 1818 as Essai sur la th√©orie des proportions chimiques et sur l'influence chimique de l'√©lectricit√©. He also introduced a new chemical nomenclature into chemistry by representing elements with letters and abbreviations, such as O for oxygen and Fe for iron. Combinations of elements were represented as sequences of these symbols and the number of atoms were represented at first by superscripts and then later subscripts.

Paffenbarger, Jr. (October 21, 1922 ‚Äì July 9, 2007, Santa Fe, New Mexico) was an epidemiologist, ultramarathoner, and professor at both Stanford University School of Medicine and Harvard University School of Public Health. Paffenbarger was internationally renowned for his classic study on the improvement in longevity through regular lifetime physical activity, which confirmed prior evidence that more physically active people reduce their risk of heart disease and live longer. He published hundreds of papers on the relationship between exercise and longevity, and helped write the recommendations to exercise in the United States Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health, published in 1996. Early life and education Paffenbarger grew up in Columbus, Ohio, the son of an Ohio State University faculty member. Paffenbarger earned his MD degree from Northwestern University Medical School during World War II, and his DrPH degree in epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University. Career Early in his career, Paffenbarger engaged in polio research as an officer in the United States Public Health Service, focusing on the transmission and pathogenesis of polio. He worked with Dr. Jonas Salk to develop the first effective polio vaccine. In the mid 1950s, he shifted to chronic disease epidemiology and the search for causes of mental illnesses associated with childbearing, site-specific cancers, and cardiovascular-hypertensive-metabolic diseases. After being urged by then President Dwight Eisenhower's physician to investigate heart disease, he began his landmark study of the relations between physical activity, chronic disease, and longevity. Paffenbarger spent time at Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley, where he served as adjunct professor of epidemiology, before joining the faculty at the Stanford School of Medicine in 1977. He became emeritus in 1993 in health research and policy at Stanford, after which he returned to UC Berkeley to join the department of human biodynamics. Paffenbarger died at the age of 84, at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 9, 2007 of heart failure. Research Over the course of almost five decades, Paffenbarger conducted some of largest and earliest scientific studies in epidemiology, which proved that increased exercise lowers the chance of death from heart disease. The study used periodic questionnaires to chronicle, over several decades, the personal characteristics, physical- activity levels, illnesses and deaths of over 50,000 college alumni. He continued to publish research findings from his studies until his own death, in 2007, at the age of 84, after a long battle with congestive heart disease. College Alumni Health Study In 1960, Paffenbarger began the landmark College Alumni Health Study, investigating the exercise habits of over 50,000 University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University alumni. The results of this study confirmed that more physically active people have a lower risk of coronary heart disease and live longer. Paffenbarger's Harvard alumni health study, of 17,000 male alumni who graduated between 1916 and 1950, found that when the alumni were in their forties, vigorous exercise predicted greater longevity and lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and that so long as energy expenditure was equivalent, it was irrelevant whether the exercise was carried out in a single session or broken up. The study also found that as the energy expended increased, the risk of heart disease decreased. Those who remained very active into midlife stood a much better chance of surviving than moderately exercising and inactive alumni. The College Alumni Health Study‚Äôs preliminary findings suggested that men burning 2,000 or more calories a week significantly lowered their risk of death from heart disease compared to more sedentary peers. Paffenbarger found that, among the 640 men in the study who had died of cardiovascular disease, the death rate for the most sedentary was nearly twice that for the most active. Regular exercise, the study also confirmed in the 1990s, reduced coronary death rates by 25 percent to 33 percent. Running long In 1967, when he was 45, Paffenbarger took up competitive running, and finished more than 150 marathon and ultramarathon events. He ran the Boston Marathon 22 times and the Western States Endurance Run five times. Recognition In 1996, Paffenbarger was a co-recipient of the first Olympic Prize for Sports Sciences for his work showing the link between physical activity and lowered risk of heart disease.

Proceedings of the IFIP/ACM SIGAPP INTEROP-ESA conference, February 23‚Äì25, Geneva, Switzerland, Springer Science publisher. Tsagkani states: :Business process interoperability is characterised as the ability of business activities of one party to interact with those of another party, whether or not these business activities belong to different units of the same business or to different businesses. It is a state that exists when a business process can meet a specific objective automatically utilizing essential human labor only. Typically, BPI is present when a process conforms to standards that enable it to achieve its objective regardless of ownership, location, make, version or design of the computer systems used.  Overview  The main attraction of BPI is that a business process can start and finish at any point worldwide regardless of the types of hardware and software required to automate it. Because of its capacity to offload human \\"mind\\" labor, BPI is considered by many as the final stage in the evolution of business computing. BPI's twin criteria of specific objective and essential human labor are both subjective. The objectives of BPI vary, but tend to fall into the following categories: * Enable end-to-end straight-through processing (\\"STP\\") by interconnecting data and procedures trapped in information silos * Let systems and products work with other systems or products without special effort on the part of the customer * Increase productivity by automating human labor * Eliminate redundant business processes and data replications * Minimize errors inherent in manual processes * Introduce mainstream enterprise software-as-a- service * Give top managers a practical means of overseeing processes used to run business operations * Encourage development of innovative Internet-based business processes * Place emphasis on business processes rather than on the systems required to operate them * Strengthen security by eliminating gaps among proprietary software systems * Improve privacy by giving users complete control over their data * Enable realtime enterprise scenarios and forecasts Business process interoperability is limited to enterprise software systems in which functions are designed to work together, such as a payroll module and a general ledger module that are part of the same program suite, and in controlled software environments that use EDI. Interoperability is also present between incompatible systems where middleware has been applied. In each of these cases, however, the processes seldom meet the test of BPI because they are constrained by information silos and the systems' inability to freely communicate among each other.  History  The term \\"Business process interoperability\\" (BPI) was coined in the late 1990s, mostly in connection with the value chain in electronic commerce.Asuman Doƒüa√ß ed. (1998) Workflow Management Systems and Interoperability. Springer-Verlag New York. Dimitrios Georgakopoulos and Aphrodite Tsalgatidou discussed the : ...need to manage the business process lifecycle effectively, i.e., to perform business process management. and ways how interoperability between WFMSs and BPMTs can provide complete support for the management of the entire business process lifecycle.. (p. 358)Derek Leebaert (1999) The Future of the Electronic Marketplace. p. 297. Leebaert acknowledged that : Achieving a robust electronic marketplace will require new concepts that promote \\"business process interoperability.\\" BPI has been utilized in promotional materials by various companies, and appears as a subject of research at organizations concerned with computer science ontologies. Despite the attention it has received, business process interoperability has not been applied outside of limited information system environments. A possible reason is that BPI requires universal conformance to standards so that a business process can start and finish at any point worldwide. The standards themselves are fairly straightforward‚Äîorganizations use a finite set of shared processes to manage most of their operations. Bringing enterprises together to create and adopt the standards is another matter entirely. The world of management systems is, after all, characterized by information silos. Moving away from silos requires organizations to deal with cultural issues such as ownership and sharing of processes and data, competitive forces and security, not to mention the effect of automation on their work forces. While the timetable or adoption of BPI cannot be predicted, it remains a subject of interest in organizations and think tanks alike.  Testing for BPI  To test for BPI, an organization analyzes a business process to determine if it can meet its specific objective utilizing essential human labor only. The specific objective must be clearly defined from start to finish. Start and finish are highly subjective, however. In one organization, a process may start when a customer orders a product and finish when the product is delivered to the customer. In another organization, the same process may be preceded with product manufacture and distribution, and may be followed by management of after-sale warranty and repairs. Essential human labor includes: *Tasks that must be performed by people because no practical means of automation is available. Examples include fighting a fire, driving a bus and preparing a meal. *Tasks that, in the opinion of management, are more effectively performed by people. Examples include answering a telephone call with a human voice and offering investment advice in person. *Tasks where the cost of automation is greater than the cost of human labor. To qualify for BPI, every process task must be taken into account from start to finish, including the labor that falls between the cracks created by incompatible software applications, such as gathering data from one system and re-inputting it in another, and preparing reports that include data from disparate systems. The process must flow uninterrupted regardless of the underlying computerized systems used. If non-essential human labor exists at any point, the process fails the test of BPI.  Achieving BPI  To assure that business processes can meet their specific objectives automatically utilizing essential human labor only, BPI takes a ‚Äúservice- oriented architecture‚Äú (SOA) approach, which focuses on the processes rather than on the technologies required to automate them. A widely used SOA is an effective way to address the problems caused by any disparate system that is the heart of each information silo. SOA makes practical sense because organizations cannot be expected to replace or modify their current enterprise software to achieve BPI, regardless of the benefits involved. Many workers' jobs are built around the applications they use, and most organizations have sizable investments in their current information infrastructures which are so complex that even the smallest modification can be very costly, time-consuming and disruptive. Even if software makers were to unite and conform their products to a single set of standards, the problem would not be solved. Besides software from well-known manufacturers, organizations use a great many legacy software systems, custom applications, manual procedures and paper forms. Without SOA, streamlining such a huge number of disparate internal processes so that they interoperate across the entire global enterprise spectrum is simply out of the question. To create an SOA for widespread use, BPI relies on a centralized database repository containing shared data and procedures common to applications in every industry and geographical area. In essence, the repository serves as a top application layer, enabling organizations to export their data to its distributed database and obtain the programs they need by simply logging on via a portal. To assure security and commercial neutrality, the repository conforms to standards promulgated by the community of BPI stakeholders. Organizations and interest groups that wish to achieve business process interoperability begin by establishing one or more BPI initiatives.

As of January 2020, the organisation is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. History The World Billiards and Snooker Council (WB&SC;) was established in 1971, following a meeting of a number of national associations at a hotel in Malta during the World Amateur Billiards Championship. The associations were dissatisfied that the Billiards and Snooker Control Council was controlling both the UK and international games. Player and journalist Clive Everton served as the first secretary, and his office served as the first office of the WB&SC.; In 1973, the WB&SC; renamed itself as the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) and began to control non-professional billiards and snooker championships. Aims and structure The aims and objectives of the IBSF are to \\"co-ordinate, promote and develop the sports of billiards and snooker on a non-professional level\\" and to manage the following competitions: *IBSF World Snooker Championship *IBSF World Six- red snooker Championships *IBSF World Team Snooker Championship *IBSF World Under-18 Snooker Championship *IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship *IBSF World Women Snooker Championship *IBSF World Masters Snooker Championships *IBSF World Billiards Championship By the end of 1984, the IBSF had thirty countries as members. As of January 2020, the IBSF has seventy-three affiliated countries categorised into one of the five Olympic regions: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. The IBSF board of directors has four executive officers (president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer) plus two representatives from each Olympic region. The executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day running of the Federation and are answerable to IBSF members at the annual general meeting, which is normally held during the period of the IBSF World Snooker Championships. Relationships to other organisations The IBSF was (alongside the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, WPBSA) one of the two snooker-focused organisational member of the World Confederation of Billiards Sports (WCBS). The WCBS is an organisation that promotes cue sports in the form of carom, pool and snooker; one of its aims is to gain the acceptance of cue sports disciplines into the Olympic Games. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) terminated its relationship with the IBSF on 31 July 2017, over conflicts involving the two organisations' relative leadership positions within WCBS, making allegations of IBSF misconduct. As a result of the split, the WPBSA has revoked the Professional Main Tour cards that were once afforded to the IBSF World Men's and World Under-21 Champions. On 5 October 2017, WPBSA announced the formation of the World Snooker Federation (WSF), with stated goals similar to those of WCBS, but focused on amateur and professional snooker, and is inviting regional and national amateur snooker federations to join WSF. As the IBSF and WPBSA were unable to come to a formal agreement as required by the WCBS, both had their WCBS membership terminated in December 2018. In March 2019, the IBSF was reinstated to the WCBS to represent snooker.

In association football, diving is an attempt by a player to gain an unfair advantage by falling to the ground and possibly feigning an injury, to give the impression that a foul has been committed. Dives are often used to exaggerate the amount of contact present in a challenge. Deciding on whether a player has dived is often very subjective, and one of the most controversial aspects of football discussion. Players do this so they can receive free kicks or penalty kicks, which can provide scoring opportunities, or so the opposing player receives a yellow or red card, giving their own team an advantage. Diving is also known as simulation (the term used by FIFA), Schwalbe (German for swallow), and, in the U.S., flopping.  Detection  Persepolis-Naft Masjed-Soleyman match. A 2009 study found that there are recognisable traits that can often be observed when a player is diving. They are: :*a separation in time between the impact and the simulation, :*a lack of ballistic continuity (the player moves farther than would be expected from the momentum of the tackle) and :*lack of contact consistency (the player nurses a body part other than where the impact occurred, such as contact to the chest causing the player to fly to the ground, holding their face). :* the \\"Archer's bow\\" pose, where the head is tilted back, chest thrust forward, arms raised and both legs bent at the knee to lift both feet off the ground to the rear, is recognised as a characteristic sign of simulation, as the action is counter to normal reflex mechanisms to protect the body in a fall. Punishment The game's rules state that \\"attempts to deceive the referee by feigning injury or pretending to have been fouled (simulation)\\", must be sanctioned as unsporting behaviour which is misconduct punishable by a yellow card. The rule changes are in response to an increasing trend of diving and simulation. Europe In 2009, UEFA made the decision to ban Arsenal forward Eduardo da Silva for a dive during a Champions League qualifier against Celtic. Eduardo initially received a penalty after referee Manuel Mejuto Gonz√°lez believed Eduardo had been fouled by Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc, but video evidence showed there was no contact between Eduardo and Boruc. Eduardo scored the subsequent penalty, with the goal putting Arsenal 3‚Äì0 up on aggregate. Arsenal manager Ars√®ne Wenger claimed the ban, which was to last two games, was \\"a complete disgrace and unacceptable\\", as it singled out Eduardo as a cheat, something which UEFA would be unable to prove. The ban was subsequently overturned on appeal, with Eduardo saying he was pleased UEFA had \\"arrived at the truth\\" as he was a \\"fair player\\" and was \\"not the type of player who needs to be dishonest\\". In 2011, Rangers player Sone Aluko was banned for two games for simulation by the Scottish FA. During a game against Dunfermline Athletic, Aluko won a penalty which was converted by Nikica Jelaviƒá and which proved to be the decisive goal. Dunfermline manager Jim McIntyre claimed it was \\"never a penalty\\" as there was no contact, and that Aluko was \\"obviously trying to get his team into a lead\\". Former referee Kenny Clark said that, while there was contact, it was \\"not enough to cause a man to spill a pint in a pub far less to fall over\\". After a club appeal had failed, Rangers manager Ally McCoist said he was \\"shocked and extremely angry\\" at the decision of the panel, which included former referee Jim McCluskey, who McCoist was critical of in particular, saying \\"his decision making hasn't improved any since he stopped refereeing\\". In November 2017, Everton player, Oumar Niasse became the first player to be banned by the Football Association for diving. He received a two- match ban for the offence while playing against Crystal Palace. North America Major League Soccer in the United States began implementing fines and suspensions for the 2011 season for simulation through its Disciplinary Committee, which reviews plays after the match. On 24 June 2011, MLS penalised D.C. United forward Charlie Davies with a US $1,000 fine as the Disciplinary Committee ruled he \\"intentionally deceived the officials and gained an unfair advantage which directly impacted the match\\" in a simulation that occurred in a match against Real Salt Lake on 18 June 2011. On 29 July 2011, the Disciplinary Committee suspended Real Salt Lake forward √Ålvaro Sabor√≠o one game and fined him US $1,000 for a simulation in a game against the San Jose Earthquakes on 23 July 2011. Officials noted the simulation resulted in Earthquakes defender Bobby Burling being sent off on the simulation, and the warning from MLS that fines and suspensions will increase for simulation being detected by the Disciplinary Committee. Furthermore, suspensions caused by players being sent off by another player's simulation can be rescinded. For example, if A2 is assessed a red card for a foul when B3 had created a simulation to make it seem A2 committed a hard foul when it was a simulation, the Disciplinary Committee can rescind the red card and suspension for A2. Oceania In all football leagues (including youth) a player who dives intently will be subject to a warning or yellow card if caught in a match. If a match is reviewed and a player gets caught they may get a 1 match suspension however if it's the 3rd time in a season they will get a 5 match suspension or until the end of that season (what ever is longer). OFC also has the right to ban players who intentionally dive to get a penalty or free kick. These rules are in effect for club and international matches.  Diving as deceptive behaviour  Recently, researchers studying signalling in animals examined diving in the context of communication theory, which suggests that deceptive behaviour should occur when the potential payoffs outweigh the potential costs (or punishments). Their aim was to discern when and where diving is likely to occur, with the aim of identifying ways to stop it. The researchers watched hundreds of hours of matches across 6 European professional leagues and found that diving is more likely to occur a) near the offensive goal and b) when the match is tied. None of the 169 dives seen in the study were punished. It was also found that diving was more common in leagues where it was rewarded most ‚Äì meaning that the more often players were likely to get free kicks or penalties out of a dive, the more often they dived. This suggests that the benefits of diving are far outweighing the costs, and the only way to reduce diving in football is by increasing the ability of referees to detect dives and by increasing the punishment associated with them. \\"Some progressive professional leagues, such as the Australian A-League and the American MLS have already started handing down punishments for players found guilty of diving. This is the best way to decrease the incentive for diving,\\" says Dr. Robbie Wilson of the soccerscience lab that conducted the study. Some have referred to simulation as a menace to footballers with real, sometimes life-threatening, injuries or conditions. On 24 May 2012, English FA referee Howard Webb spoke to a FIFA medical conference in Budapest about the importance of curbing simulation in football, as players feigning injury could put players with serious medical issues in jeopardy. Earlier that year, he had to deal with the collapse of Fabrice Muamba, who suffered cardiac arrest during an FA Cup match.Referee: Don't 'cry wolf' on injuries Diving reputation Repeated accusations of diving have resulted in certain players acquiring the reputation of being a \\"diver\\".

They can also teach in various patient care settings to provide continuing education to licensed nursing staff. Nurse Educators teach in graduate programs at Master's and doctoral level which prepare advanced practice nurses, nurse educators, nurse administrators, nurse researchers, and leaders in complex healthcare and educational organizations. The type of degree required for a nurse educator may be dependent upon the governing nurse practice act or upon the regulatory agencies that define the practice of nursing. In the United States, one such agency is the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.NCSBN website For instance, faculty in the U.S. may be able to teach in an LPN program with an associate degree in nursing. Most baccalaureate and higher degree programs require a minimum of a graduate degree and prefer the doctorate for full-time teaching positions. Many nurse educators have a clinical specialty background blended with coursework in education. Many schools offer the Nurse Educator track which focuses on educating nurses going into any type setting. Individuals may complete a post-Master's certificate in education to complement their clinical expertise if they choose to enter a faculty role. Nurse educators can choose to teach in a specialized field of their choosing. There is not extra degree needed to be earned other than a master's degree in nursing. Most schools will only hire a nurse to teach a class if they have had experience in that area. This is so the students can have a better understanding of the current subject being taught. In Australia, Nurse Educators must be Registered Nurses (RNs/Division 1 Nurses). The Nurse Educator role is not available to Enrolled Nurses (ENs/Division 2 Nurses). Nurse Educators require a minimum of a Certificate IV in Training and Assessment to teach the Diploma of Nursing in both the classroom and clinical placement settings. Bachelor of Nursing Educators do not technically require this qualification, but it is generally favoured. A Nurse Educator may also complete post-graduate university study in Nursing or Clinical Education, which may lead to an academic career including research, lecturing or doctoral study. To become a Clinical Nurse Educator in a healthcare setting (e.g. on an acute care ward), Registered Nurses are generally required to have 5‚Äì10 years clinical experience and 6‚Äì8 years of study (a bachelor's degree plus post- graduate certificate or diploma).

The construction of the palace began in the 1620s and completed in 1636 by the Lord High Steward (Swedish: riksdrots) Gabriel Oxenstierna. He also constructed the nearby Tyres√∂ Church (Swedish:Tyres√∂ kyrka), which was inaugurated with his own burial in 1641. The palace was inherited in 1648 by Maria Sofia De la Gardie, who had married Gustaf Gabrielsson Oxenstierna, nephew of Swedish Regent and Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna. Both she and her husband's family were extremely wealthy. Maria Sofia resided in Tyres√∂ Palace, from where she managed her estates around the Baltic Sea, until 1694. Between 1699 and 1737, the writer Maria Gustava Gyllenstierna lived at the palace. During the 1770s the palace was modernized and the first English garden in Sweden was created. Planned by the garden architect Fredrik Magnus Piper, it is a mixture of an English park, a Swedish floral meadow and images from a fairy tale - with the ancient forest as its ultimate source of inspiration. The extensive, apparently natural landscape gardens still exist today. Map of the palace grounds from 1882. Today Tyres√∂ Palace is a museum. Marquis Claes Lagergren purchased Tyres√∂ Palace in 1892. Assisted by architect Isak Gustaf Clason, the Marquis rebuilt the palace in a national romantic style, inspired by original drawings from the 17th century. The Marquis wanted the palace kept as a living document of Swedish history, and after he died in 1930, he left Tyres√∂ Palace to a museum foundation, the Nordic Museum (Swedish: Nordiska museet). Today the Nordic Museum owns the palace, which is open for guided tours during the summer.

It is a rough-coated scent hound still kept primarily as a hunting dog rather than as a pet.  Description =Appearance Dogs of this breed can vary considerably in size, as the dog is still bred primarily for hunting, so more emphasis might be placed on performance than on specific appearance requirements. It can range from 26 to 60 lb (12 to 27 kg) and stand 17 to 24 inches (43 to 60 cm) at the withers. The breed's wiry coat is weather resistant for hunting. The topcoat is 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) long and it has a woolly undercoat. The color is white with yellow or orange markings, usually on the ears. The ears are broad and hang flat with a long upstanding curved inwards tail. Temperament Again, because the Istrian Coarse-haired Hound has been bred primarily for hunting rather than as a companion, it tends to be willful and hence more challenging to train than many other breeds. History Croatian and Slovene breeders created the Istrian Coarse-haired Hound in the mid-19th century by crossing the French Griffon Vende√©n with the Istrian Shorthaired Hound, a smooth-haired hound developed from both sight hounds and scent hounds. The breed first took part in a conformation show in Vienna in 1866. The origin of the Istrian Coarse-haired Hound has been disputed since the 1960s, with competing claims from Croatia and Slovenia. In 2003 the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale recognized the breed as originating in Croatia. The dog is still used for hunting fox, rabbits, hare, and wild boar.

Bully-Cummings (born 1958) was the chief of police of the City of Detroit from 2003 to 2008. Early life and education Bully-Cummings was born in Japan, the second-oldest of eight children of an African American repairman and a (now retired) Japanese American chef. Her parents met when her father was serving in the U.S. Army as part of the American Occupation forces. The family settled in Detroit, her Mississippi-born father's adopted hometown, before she was two years old. While in high school she worked at a movie theater, and between graduating from high school and going into the police force in 1977 she worked as an administrative assistant at Redford High School and sold real estate. She attended Henry Ford Junior High School in Highland Park, Michigan, and is a graduate of Cass Technical High School. Bully- Cummings helped her parents pay for her siblings' education through early years on the police force. She went to college herself while still serving on the police force after helping to pay for five of her siblings. In December 1993 Bully-Cummings graduated with honors from Madonna University with a bachelor's degree in public administration. She then went on to graduate cum laude from Michigan State University College of Law with a J.D. in January 1998 and was sworn into the State Bar of Michigan in May 1998. Career Bully-Cummings entered the police academy in 1977. In the mid-1980s she worked for the Detroit Free Press as a receptionist, secretary, and administrative assistant when hundreds of police officers were laid-off due to budget cuts. Back to the force, she rose to the rank of sergeant in 1987. She continued her rise in the department by making lieutenant in 1993 and commander in 1998. In July 1999 retired from the department to become a staff attorney first at Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone PLC, then at Foley & Lardner, and finally back at Miller Canfield. She represented management in employment cases that involved federal and state discrimination. In 2002 she was called back into service by Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick as an Assistant Chief of Police, the first female appointed to assistant chief position in Detroit. She was charged with overseeing Management Services, Training, Personnel, Science and Technology, and Risk Management bureaus, collectively called the \\"Administrative Portfolio\\". After the resignation of Chief Jerry Oliver in 2003, Bully- Cummings was appointed as interim chief. She became permanent in 2004.Hackney, Suzette and Schmitt, Ben (with Audi, Tamara). \\"New chief lays down the law: Preferring progress over praise, she has changes planned\\" Detroit Free Press, November 8, 2003, 1A. Hackney, Suzette and Schaefer, Jim. \\"Native Detroiter worked her way up\\" Detroit Free Press, November 4, 2003, 1A. Under her leadership, in 2004, the Detroit Police Department realized the greatest reduction in major crimes in 41 years, and a record reduction of 15.2% in violent crimes. The Detroit Police were under the supervision of US District Judge Julian Abele Cook Jr. until 2008 per a US Justice Department investigation. Bully-Cummings was held in contempt of court in late 2005 for not reinstating four inspectors and three commanders, who were let go as a part of the restructuring of the police department to save money. A total of 150 police personnel were laid off. Slander suit Mayor Kilpatrick, his Chief of Staff Christine Beatty and Bully-Cummings were named in a lawsuit brought about by Detroit Police officers Zack Weishuhn and Patrick Tomsic, who claimed that they were slandered in the media by city officials. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2004 incident in which the two police officers pulled Beatty over for speeding. The officers claimed that Beatty was irate at being stopped and bluntly asked the officers, \\"Do you know who the fuck I am?\\" when the officers came to the vehicle. The officers alleged that, while stopped, Beatty called Bully-Cummings to have the officers called off, which they were ordered to do. When reports of the incident started to surface in the media, Bully- Cummings said the officers harassed Beatty, and Kilpatrick said the stop \\"looked like a setup\\". As part of a settlement, the Detroit City Council voted to approve a $25,000 mediation recommendation to the two officers in February 2008, after previously rejecting the settlement twice. The offer was accepted. On September 4, 2008, Bully-Cummings announced her retirement, minutes after Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and resigned from office as part of a plea deal. She offered to assist her successor in transitioning to the duties of Police Chief if asked to do so. Awards and recognition Bully-Cummings is a 2005 recipient of the General Motors and Black Entertainment Television‚Äôs \\"History Maker in the Making\\" Award, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Center for Women and Policing. Personal life Bully-Cummings is married to Attorney William Cummings, a retired Detroit police commander. She was previously married to former Wayne County Sheriff and former Detroit Police Chief Warren Evans.

It rises to and is usually covered in snow from June to September. Unlike many other Victorian mountains, Mount Feathertop has steep summit slopes instead of a rounded summit dome. Mount Feathertop's proximity to the Mount Hotham ski resort has led to it becoming a popular backcountry skiing destination. A sizable snow cornice usually forms along the summit ridge in winter, the collapse of which has claimed the life of a number of people who stood on it. Snow remaining in the summit gullies in spring gives the appearance of feathers - hence the name \\"Feathertop\\".  History  Mount Feathertop was named in 1851 by Jim Brown and Jack Wells, stockmen who worked on Cobungra Station and were the first Europeans to systematically explore the Bogong High Plains. Dr (later Baron) Ferdinand von Mueller was the first non- aboriginal to climb Mount Feathertop. Unaware that the peak had already been named, he proposed that it might be named Mount La Trobe after Charles La Trobe who was Victoria's lieutenant-governor at the time. Members of the Bright Alpine Club made the first winter ascent in September 1889. A track from Harrietville was cut in 1906 along a similar route to the current Bungalow Spur track and a rough shelter was built near a spring on a flat area below the treeline. The shelter was replaced by Feathertop Hut in 1912. In 1925, the Feathertop Bungalow was built, with materials and prefabricated sections transported by packhorse and sled. It had 24 guest beds and provided commercial accommodation on the mountain before being lost in the Black Friday bushfire of 1939.Sisson, David. Mt Feathertop: history, huts and hikes. Retrieved 20 June 2015 Vegetation Forests of Mountain Ash cover the lower slopes of Mount Feathertop up to an altitude of about where Snow Gums begin to dominate. Above the treeline at around , vegetation consists of alpine shrubland and grassland. Access routes Snow on the Bungalow Spur track near Federation Hut. The main access routes on Mount Feathertop are the Razorback (north and south), Bon Accord Spur, Bungalow Spur, North-west Spur, and Diamantina Spur. Hiking on the East Ridge, North-east Spur, and Champion Spur has been possible at times after fires but the routes are now overgrown and rarely used. The North Razorback track is the shortest and easiest route to Mount Feathertop but it is along a ridgeline and can be very exposed during bad weather. It is possible to drive to within of the summit during summer but a winter road closure leaves a walk or ski of . The South Razorback is a very popular walk in summer and it is a spectacular ski tour in winter. It starts at Diamantina Hut on the Great Alpine Road near the Mount Hotham ski resort and is relatively flat but is also very exposed during bad weather. The south Razorback track covers a distance of from its start to the summit. The Bon Accord Spur track starts in Harrietville and climbs up to the Razorback to join the South Razorback track near the Big Dipper, approximately from Diamantina Hut. Ascending to the summit from MUMC hut in winter. The Bungalow Spur track also starts near Harrietville at an elevation of . It was built for pack horses servicing the former Feathertop Bungalow and climbs gradually but continually for until it reaches Federation Hut. The track then continues for another until reaching the summit, joining the Razorback and North West Spur tracks along the way. The Tom Kneen track along the North West Spur is a steep and hard climb starting near Stony Creek and reaching the Melbourne University Mountaineering Club hut after . From the hut, it continues across Feathertop's west face to join the track from Federation Hut to the summit. This route was named after a skier who died in an avalanche on Feathertop during 1985. The Diamantina Spur track climbs from the Kiewa River West Branch for before joining the South Razorback track about from Mount Feathertop's summit. It offers great views of Mount Feathertop but climbs steeply (very in places) and involves some scrambling over loose shale.  Mountain huts  Federation Hut after an early May snowfall There are two intact huts on the mountain and the ruins of several more. In 1906, at the instigation of Jim Tobias and the Harrietville Progress Society, a rough track to the mountain from Harrietville was cut running close to the present track up Bungalow Spur. A 'shelter shed' was also built near a spring on a flat area below the treeline. In 1912 it was replaced by Feathertop Hut. The hut was mainly used as a base for summer excursions, but was occasionally used for climbing and snow walks. The hut survived the 1939 bushfires but by the 1960s it was in poor condition. Federation Hut was built higher up the hill to replace it and Feathertop Hut collapsed in the late 1970s. The Feathertop Bungalow was built in 1925 and operated successfully as a 26-bed hotel for two years before problems with land tenure forced the owners to sell it to the railways at a knock down price. After a few years of neglect the railways realised its potential and operated it successfully for a decade before it burnt down in the Black Friday bushfires of 1939 and was never rebuilt. The site is visible on the Bungalow Spur track but few signs of the Bungalow remain.Sisson, David Retrieved 20 June 2015 Razorback Hut was strategically placed halfway between Diamantina Hut and the Feathertop Bungalow. It appears to have been built after the First World War. It was a fairly basic refuge hut measuring 14' x 10' with a dirt floor and a single window. It was burnt in the 1939 bushfires and never replaced MUMC hut on Mt Feathertop In 1966 the Melbourne University Mountaineering Club built a large hut at the top of the North-West Spur to serve as a base for winter alpine activities in memory of two club members who had died in a climbing accident in New Zealand. The hut was designed by Peter Kneen, a final-year Civil Engineering student at Melbourne University. It is a geodesic dome clad with aluminium sheeting and includes a spacious upstairs sleeping area. Materials were carried to the site from the roadhead on the North Razorback track. The silver aluminium cladding was painted its current drab green in March 1977. Federation Hut was originally built in 1968-69 by the Federation of Victorian Walking Clubs and is situated on the treeline at the top of Bungalow Spur near Little Feathertop. The hut was renovated and reclad in timber by Ian Stapleton in 1988, and destroyed by the 2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires before being rebuilt in 2005 by Parks Victoria. Accidents Victorian Minister Tim Holding disappeared at the mountain on 31 August 2009 when he failed to return from his solo hiking journey. Sixty searchers were deployed in the field by Monday evening, 31 August 2009, including Victorian Police Search and Rescue, Mt Hotham Ski Patrol, Bush Search and Rescue and the State Emergency Service.Search at Mount Feathertop on Monday 31 August 2009, Bush Search and Rescue Victoria, 31 August 2009 He was found during the morning on Tuesday 1 September, one day after searchers were deployed on Monday. Uninjured, he reported that he had lost his footing on an icy slope, and slid down into a gully. Disoriented, and with poor visibility, he waited for rescue, using a reflective space blanket to attract attention. Graeme Nelson, a 56-year-old doctor from Eden in south-eastern New South Wales, died on 24 August 2011 while skiing with friends in Avalanche Gully on Mount Feathertop. Dr Nelson is believed to have slipped in icy conditions and fell 700 metres down an icy slope, dying before his skiing companions could climb down to reach him. Tom Kneen, cousin of Peter Kneen who designed the MUMC Hut, died in August 1985 when he and three companions strayed onto the snow cornice in a virtual whiteout near the summit. Steven Galland died on Feathertop in 1983 when he fell whilst digging a snow cave on an MUMC trip. South of the summit pyramid at the start of the Razorback there is a hill with a small cairn and a plaque in remembrance of Molly Hill who may have been the first skier to die in Victoria. Mary (Molly) Ann Hill was with a group from the Ski Club of Victoria that was stuck at the Feathertop Bungalow during six days of poor weather. On Friday 2 September 1932 a group of six set out for Hotham Heights. After they climbed to the Razorback, Molly slipped on a steep patch of ice and slid over 60 metres down a steep slope before hitting a tree. A rescue party was quickly organised and she was stretchered to Harrietville from where she was driven to hospital in Bright. Molly Hill died of head injuries later that night and was buried in the Cheltenham cemetery.Sisson, David.

Le Syst√®me international d‚Äôunit√©s / The International System of Units (‚ÄòThe SI Brochure‚Äô). Bureau international des poids et mesures, eighth edition, 2006, updated 2014. URL http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/, . The joule-second is a unit of action or of angular momentum. The joule-second also appears in quantum mechanics within the definition of Planck's constant.Schlamminger, S.; Haddad, D.; Seifert, F.; Chao, L. S.; Newell, D. B.; Liu, R.; Steiner, R. L.; Pratt, J. R. (2014). \\"Determination of the Planck constant using a watt balance with a superconducting magnet system at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\\" Metrologia. 51 (2): S15. arXiv:1401.8160 . Bibcode:2014Metro..51S..15S. doi:10.1088/0026-1394/51/2/S15. ISSN 0026-1394. Angular momentum is the product of an object‚Äôs moment of inertia, in units of kg‚ãÖm2 and its angular velocity in units of rad‚ãÖs‚àí1. This product of moment of inertia and angular velocity yields kg‚ãÖm2‚ãÖs‚àí1 or the joule-second. Planck's constant represents the energy of a wave, in units of joule, divided by the frequency of that wave, in units of s‚àí1. This quotient of energy and frequency also yields the joule-second (J‚ãÖs). Base units In SI base units the joule- second becomes kilogram-meter squared-per second or kg‚ãÖm2‚ãÖs‚àí1. Dimensional Analysis of the joule-second yields M L2 T‚àí1. Note the denominator of seconds (s) in the base units. Confusion with joules per second The joule-second should not be confused with the physical process of joules per second (J/s). _Joules per second:_ In physical processes, when the unit of time appears in the denominator of a ratio, the described process occurs at a rate. For example, in discussions about speed, an object like a car travels a known distance of kilometers spread over a known number of seconds, and the car‚Äôs rate of speed becomes kilometers per second (km/s). In physics, work per time describes a system‚Äôs power; defined by the unit watt (W), which is joule per second (J/s). _joules-second:_ To understand joules x second (J‚ãÖs) we can imagine the operator of an energy storage facility quoting a price for storing energy. Storing 10,000 joules for 400 seconds would cost a certain amount. Storing double the energy for half the time would use the same resources, and cost the same. Another example is the use of kilowatt-hour as a unit of energy. In this case, we are using the rate of energy output multiply by the time over which the output exists, to represent the total energy. In other words, to understand what Joules * seconds means, one must understand the terms by themselves. The Joule is a unit of energy and the second is a unit of time. So, what 500 J.s means, is that there is a source of energy that I can use in the following manner: 500 Jules for 1 second; or 250 Jules for 2 seconds; or 100 Jules for 5 seconds; or 1 Jule for 500 seconds; or in any combination of numbers who's product is 500!

One possible meaning is of someone who creeps around a packed church to pray at each of the Stations of the Cross hanging on the walls with the intention that everyone in the pews can see him doing so, as if to say \\"notice how religious I am\\". It is used in a rather different sense in William Blake's poem The Everlasting Gospel: :If he had been Antichrist, Creeping Jesus, :He'd have done anything to please us: :Gone sneaking into synagogues :And not us‚Äôd the Elders and Priests like dogs :But humble as a lamb or ass :Obey‚Äôd Himself to Caiaphas.58\\\\. The Everlasting Gospel by William Blake. Nicholson & Lee, eds. 1917. The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse Changing meanings By the end of the 20th century, the term had evolved somewhat away from a purely religion-focused term to one levelled at any public display presumed to be totally hypocritical. Though originally a Hiberno-English term, it has now appeared in British English, Australian English, American English, Scots, and Scottish English, having been brought to other countries by Irish emigrant communities. Examples of usage The term is used as a character nickname in the novel Morvern Callar by Alan Warner. The term likewise shows up in the novel After the fire, a still small voice by Evie Wyld. The usage in this latter instance has to deal not with the traditional meaning of the term, but as a bogeyman manifestation of the protagonist's haunting trauma.

Before the City of Winnipeg Act of 1972, it was an independent rural municipality. The population was 39,358 (Source: Statistics Canada). It is bounded by the Red River on the east; the North Limit of the City of Winnipeg on the north; Pipeline Road, Mollard Road, Ritchie Street, Farmer Avenue, and Keewatin Street on the west; and Carruthers Avenue, McPhillips Street, Templeton Avenue, the Canadian Pacific Railway Winnipeg Beach Subdivision, Seaforth Avenue, Main Street, and the north limit of the Kildonan Golf Course on the south.  History  The Rural Municipality of Old Kildonan was originally part of the Rural Municipality of Kildonan, which was formed in 1875 in Manitoba. It was part of the Red River Colony, and originally rivalled Fort Garry in the Winnipeg area. From 1875 to 1914, Kildonan covered a large area on both sides of the Red River, just north of the original City of Winnipeg. In 1914, Kildonan was divided: The area east of the river became the R. M. of East Kildonan, and the area west of the river became the R. M. of West Kildonan. At that time, West Kildonan included the area of Old Kildonan but on July 1,1921 the two municipalities divided, as West Kildonan had been developed as a residential suburb of Winnipeg, and wanted expensive urban services, while Old Kildonan remained primarily rural, and still had the rural farming character of the \\"Old\\" Parish of Kildonan. After the division of the area, the first elected Reeve of Old Kildonan was Robert Toshack. Councillor was H. J. Seymour, elected by acclimation in June 1921. The area did not see substantial development until the late 1960s with the construction of The Maples subdivision, and even today contains substantial undeveloped areas and a number of farms.

History Born in Venice, Contarini was a contemporary of Palma il Giovane. He was a great student of the works of Tintoretto and Titian and is declared to have been an exact imitator of Titian. According to an old story he was so extremely accurate in his portraits that on \\"sending home one he had taken of Marco Dolce, his dogs began to fawn upon it, mistaking it for their master\\". Contarini's work is extremely mannered, soft and sweet, but distinguished by beautiful, rich coloring and executed very much on the lines of Titian's painting. His finest picture is in the Louvre, having been removed from the ducal palace at Venice, and represents the Virgin and Child with St Mark and St Sebastian, and the Doge of Venice, Marino Grimani, kneeling before them. Other paintings of his are in the galleries at Berlin, Florence, Milan, and Vienna, and in many of the churches at Venice. He painted easel-pictures of Greek and Roman mythological subjects, which are treated with propriety and discretion but are peculiarly lacking in force and strength; in many of the palaces in Venice he decorated ceilings. Some years of his life were passed at the court of the Emperor Rudolf II, with whom he was a great favorite and by whom he was knighted. His work has been described by one writer as a \\"combination of sugar, cream, mulberry juice, sunbeam and velvet\\", but the criticism is a little unjust and one or two of his works, for example the \\"Resurrection\\" in the church of San Francesco di Paola at Venice, can claim to be masterly.

It also provides a common vocabulary with which to discuss implementations, often with the aim to stress commonality. A software reference architecture is a software architecture where the structures and respective elements and relations provide templates for concrete architectures in a particular domain or in a family of software systems. A reference architecture often consists of a list of functions and some indication of their interfaces (or APIs) and interactions with each other and with functions located outside of the scope of the reference architecture. Reference architectures can be defined at different levels of abstraction. A highly abstract one might show different pieces of equipment on a communications network, each providing different functions. A lower level one might demonstrate the interactions of procedures (or methods) within a computer program defined to perform a very specific task. A reference architecture provides a template, often based on the generalization of a set of solutions. These solutions may have been generalized and structured for the depiction of one or more architecture structures based on the harvesting of a set of patterns that have been observed in a number of successful implementations. Further it shows how to compose these parts together into a solution. Reference Architectures will be instantiated for a particular domain or for specific projects. Adopting a reference architecture within an organization accelerates delivery through the re-use of an effective solution and provides a basis for governance to ensure the consistency and applicability of technology use within an organization. In the field of software architecture, many empirical studies have shown the following common benefits and drawbacks from adopting a software reference architecture within organizations: (a) improvement of the interoperability of the software systems by establishing a standard solution and common mechanisms for information exchange; (b) reduction of the development costs of software projects through the reuse of common assets; (c) improvement of the communication inside the organization because stakeholders share the same architectural mindset; and, (d) influencing the learning curve of developers due to the need of learning its features.

He was widely seen as a Machiavellian figure, and as holding too much influence over Eric. On both occasions that the King was removed from power Persson was quickly arrested by the nobility; the second time he was executed shortly after his arrest. Life Persson was born in Sala, the son of a local priest, Curatus Petrus (Per Joensson) and Anna Pehrs√∂nernas moder, in about 1530. He was the brother of Christern Persson. Early career During the early 1550s he studied at the University of Wittenberg, where he proved to be a very gifted student and, according to legend, was highly regarded by the eminent theologian Philipp Melanchthon, who, on his journey back to Sweden in 1555, sent with him a recommendation letter to King Gustav I. Upon his return to Sweden he was given an annual pension and employment in the King's service, a year later he became personal secretary to the King and was given a castle in Vyborg. In 1558 he received another important commission from the king, namely being put in charge of the King's inspectors in V√§sterg√∂tland in order to establish a register of the estates, which, to the detriment of the Crown, remained loyal to Rome. To be entrusted with such an important matter showed that Persson, even at this early stage in his career, had made himself known in prominent circles as a man capable of getting difficult tasks done. Following the completion of his mission in V√§sterg√∂tland, Gustav allowed Persson to become personal secretary to his eldest son, Eric. \\"Erik XIV and Karin M√•nsdotter\\" (J√∂ran Persson standing), by Georg von Rosen (1871) Persson had established a reputation for possessing a quick mind and a sharp wit, and of being ambitious, bold, and ruthless. It is also known that Persson was very familiar with astrology, which he believed to guide the lives of men to a certain extent; despite having been raised and educated in the Protestant tradition, he appears to have been an agnostic. Enthronement of Eric Following Erik's accession to the throne in 1560, Persson was raised into the nobility. He took a coat of arms bearing a design of three bricks, and became the lord of Tr√∂gd Hundred; at this point he took the family name Tegel. He was married in 1561 to a woman named Anna Andersdotter. The couple had two children: the renowned historian Erik J√∂ransson Tegel, and his brother Anders J√∂ransson Tegel who married Brita M√•nsdotter Hand. Persson played an important role in the Konungens n√§mnd (literally: King's committee, the highest court in Sweden), where he served simultaneously as a prosecutor and the King's representative. This meant that, as well as prosecuting, he also had some control over sentencing. It is not known how many of the 300 death sentences handed down by the court he had a personal involvement in, however he was regarded by many as the nation's foremost executioner (it is still a point of contention whether he took orders from the King in such matters, or whether he acted on his own initiative). He became very unpopular among the public, as did his brother, Christiern Persson (d.1567), who was also given a position in the court; they were, among the public, believed to be under the \\"evil influence\\" of their mother Anna, who was widely believed to be a witch who influenced the politics with sorcery. Imprisonment of John Persson would go to any length to protect the King's throne and power. The most famous example of this came in the summer of 1563 when he crushed the formative rebellion of the King's half-brother, Duke John of Finland. He ordered that John be imprisoned in his home, Turku Castle, along with his followers, who were to be executed. Instead of being executed, the Duke was shortly afterwards taken to Vaxholm to meet with Persson, representing the King, who decided that they should be detained in Gripsholm Castle, so a close eye could be kept on the Duke and his wife. Persson also saw to it that the couple's detention was harsh, far more so than the King had ordered. Sture Murders Shortly after the imprisonment of Duke John, the Northern Seven Years' War began between Sweden and a coalition of Denmark- Norway, L√ºbeck and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The war, which was particularly bloody, went well for Sweden at sea, but went very badly on land. The war became increasingly unpopular as Swedish towns were damaged and destroyed, and casualties mounted. As the aristocracy's frustration with Eric's reign became increasingly apparent, the King and Persson feared a new rebellion. Eric, who at this stage was beginning to show signs of mental illness, decided to take action to prevent a rebellion and he invited those he suspected of plotting against him to Svartsj√∂ Castle in May 1567. Those suspected of being a threat to the King were arrested upon their arrival at the castle and they were tried in Uppsala with Persson leading the prosecutions. All those tried were, unsurprisingly, found guilty and sentenced to death. The last nobleman to arrive at Svartsj√∂ was Nils Svantesson Sture, the grandson of regent Sten Sture the Younger, who had only just returned from a diplomatic mission to Lorraine. The King had long regarded Sture as the most dangerous nobleman in Sweden; in 1566 he had ordered Sture's execution but ultimately decided against this and publicly humiliated him instead. Sture was arrested on 22 May, the following day Eric murdered him in his cell. Following the murder, Persson managed to convince a council of the nobility, who were unaware of Sture's murder, that those who had been arrested were traitors and that the death penalty was therefore justified; the assent of the nobility meant that the murder and the executions were legal. The murder of Nils Sture, however, had a huge effect on Eric's health. Within weeks he was removed from the throne on grounds of insanity. The regents elected to rule in place of Eric decided to release John from prison, and decided to arrest Persson for ordering the deaths of the prisoners in Uppsala; it had become apparent by this stage that those executed were not traitors, but victims of the King's increasing paranoia. Later career The King recovered from his illness later in the year and was allowed to retake his throne, his first act following this was to release Persson. He did not, however, send his brother back to prison; on the contrary he reconciled with him. John used the first pretext he could find, Eric's marriage to the commoner Karin M√•nsdotter, to lead a rebellion against his brother. Almost the entirety of the nobility, wishing to have revenge for Eric's treatment of them, rallied behind John. This rebellion, somewhat conveniently, resulted in the King once again showing signs of insanity. Death In September 1568, Eric was forced to abdicate and was succeeded by his brother, who took the title John III. Following this, Persson was once again arrested. John, who had never forgiven Persson for his treatment whilst imprisoned in Gripsholm, ordered his death following a very hasty trial, which found him guilty of a number of crimes surrounding his role in suppressing the nobility. Persson died very slowly; he was sentenced to the breaking wheel and severely tortured before being beheaded at some point between 18 September and 21 September 1568. His mother was ordered to be executed with him, but threw herself off the horse on the way to the execution and died.

Andr√© Spire (28 July 1868 ‚Äì 29 July 1966) was a French poet, writer, and Zionist activist. Biography Born in 1868 in Nancy, to a Jewish family of the middle bourgeoisie, long established in Lorraine, Spire studied literature, then law. He attended the √âcole libre des sciences politiques, now called the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Institut d'√©tudes politiques), or Sciences-Po, and later, in 1894, was appointed to the Conseil d'√âtat on successfully passing the competitive entrance examination. A few months later, the Dreyfus Affair broke when a Jewish military officer was wrongly accused of treason, revealing how widespread antisemitism was at the time in France. Spire provoked a duel with a columnist from the Libre Parole (a nationalist and anti-semitic newspaper run by Edouard Drumont) for alleging that the Jews appointed to the Conseil d'Etat won their positions not on merit but through illicit influence. Spire was wounded in the arm. In 1896, he and a Catholic colleague founded the Soci√©t√© des Visiteurs, dedicated to helping workers suffering from unemployment, illness, or injury. Shortly thereafter, he took part in the Cooperation des Id√©es, where he met Daniel Hal√©vy. The two men founded an Universit√© populaire. Spire left the Conseil d'Etat for the ministry of Labor, then joined the staff of Jean Dupuy, Minister of Agriculture in the government of Waldeck-Rousseau. He became friends with Charles P√©guy who published his Et vous riez ! in Les Cahiers de la quinzaine (1905), poems which reflect a certain disappointment with the worker's movement. In 1902, he was commissioned by the Office du Travail (Labor Office) to conduct an inquiry into the labor conditions of English workers and discovered the East European Jewish immigrant neighbourhood of Whitechapel in the East End of London. In 1904, he was deeply moved by a short story by Israel Zangwill in the Cahiers de la quinzaine entitled Chad Gadya. It relates the tale of a young Venetian Jew from a traditional family attracted by the external non-Jewish world. Not able to find his place in either world he ends by committing suicide. Spire engaged in the Zionist cause, joining Zangwill's Jewish Territorial Organisation (ITO) and campaigned, publishing numerous articles. In 1912 he founded the AJJ (Association des Jeunes Juifs), the French Jewish youth organisation.The Routledge Encyclopedia of Jewish Writers of the Twentieth Century During the First World War, Spire, not able to be mobilised, ran the family factory. He was also charged by the Ministry of Agriculture with work on the reconstruction of war-damaged regions. In 1920, Dr. Chaim Weizmann invited Spire to accompany him to Palestine. Following the defeat of France in 1940, Spire was forced into exile in the United States of America where he was invited to teach French Literature at the New School for Social Research and the √âcole libre des Hautes √©tudes in New York. Very active, Spire also participated in numerous conferences and completed his classic study of poetics Plaisir po√©tique et plaisir musculaire, essai sur l'√©volution des techniques po√©tiques (Jos√© Corti 1949 ; new edition 1986). After the war he returned to France. Spire died in Paris at the age of 98. His funeral was led by Rabbi David Feuerwerker.

History It was founded in 1863 by the brothers Maurus and Placidus Wolter, in buildings which until 1802 had housed an Augustinian monastery. Between 1875 and 1887 because of political conditions during the \\"Kulturkampf\\" (\\"cultural struggle\\") the monks had to leave the abbey, but used the opportunity to found new communities elsewhere, which afterwards joined together under the leadership of Beuron as the Beuronese Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Beuron Art School, with its emphasis on early Christian and Byzantine art, was influential on religious art of the period. One of the biggest exhibits of this type of art in the United States is at Conception Abbey in Missouri which was founded on principles established by Beuron. The abbey continues to be a centre of study. The library is the largest monastic library in Germany, with over 400,000 books. Since 1884 the abbey has published the Missale Romanum, a lay missal originally produced by Father Anselm Schott of Beuron.

The two highways overlap, first by going north and then by going west, into Pawnee City. In Pawnee City, the overlap with N-8 ends and a new one with N-65 begins. The two highways overlap going north out of Pawnee City and separate near Table Rock, Nebraska. Two miles north, N-50 briefly overlaps N-4 before going north again. Near Elk Creek, N-50 meets N-62. Further north, N-50 passes through Tecumseh and meets U.S. Highway 136. The highway continues due north from Tecumseh through Syracuse, passing by N-41 and N-128 between Tecumseh and Syracuse. In Syracuse, N-50 meets N-2. N-50 continues due north from Syracuse, meeting US 34 near Avoca. Near Manley, N-50 meets N-1. It continues north and curves northeast before meeting N-66. N-50 and N-66 overlap until the southwestern edge of Louisville, where they separate, though signage on N-50 has \\"To N-66\\" signs in the Louisville area, due to a gap in that highway in Louisville. After passing through Louisville, N-50 immediately crosses the Platte River and then immediately meets N-31. N-50 then goes northeast briefly and turns north to go through Springfield, where the highway becomes divided. As the highway approaches Omaha, it meets N-370 and then Interstate 80. It then continues north into the Millard neighborhood of Omaha on 144th Street, then turns northeast onto Millard Avenue. After passing through Millard, N-50 ends by meeting US 275 and N-92.

From 23 April 1964 to 22 April 1976 he was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council for the Liberal Party. Packer was originally intended to be his father's heir before a falling-out in 1972 resulted in Kerry inheriting the family business in 1974 upon Frank's death. Among his many business activities, Packer founded the independent Spin Records label, which released many successful singles and albums from 1966 to 1972, including The Bee Gees' \\"Spicks and Specks\\" (1966) and the original Australian cast recording of the rock musical Hair (1969). In 1976 Packer relocated to the United States, initially living in Los Angeles before moving to Santa Barbara, California. Robert Clyde Packer died of heart and lung failure on 8 April 2001, aged 65. Early life Clyde Packer was born Robert Clyde Packer on 22 July 1935. He was named for his paternal grandfather, Robert Clyde Packer (1879‚Äì1934), who had established the Packer media dynasty. Clyde's father was Sir Frank Packer (1906‚Äì1974), a media proprietor who controlled Australian Consolidated Press and the Nine Network. His mother, Gretel Joyce n√©e Bullmore (1907‚Äì1960), was the daughter of Herbert Bullmore (1874‚Äì1937), an Australian-born physician and rugby union player who represented Scotland. His younger brother was Kerry Packer (17 December 193726 December 2005). During their early childhood Clyde and Kerry were cared for by a nurse, Inez McCracken, whom Clyde described as a \\"surrogate mother\\" who made \\"an unbearable childhood tolerable\\". Packer was a boarder at Cranbrook School in Sydney and then Geelong Grammar in Victoria. He took part in various sports at school, including boxing, cricket, and rugby.  Media career In the early 1950s, instead of attending university as he wished, Clyde Packer heeded his father's directive \\"You go to work for me ... You'll learn far more in the school of hard knocks\\". He joined Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) as a journalist and sub-editor of its flagship, The Daily Telegraph. For six months he worked at the Daily Mail in London. In 1954 ACP launched a magazine, Weekend, with Donald Horne as editor and Packer on staff. By 1956 Packer was a director at ACP, Frank purchased the rights to Sydney TV station TCN-9 ‚Äì the first Australian station to begin regular broadcasting. By 1957 Weekend employed Lillian Roxon as a journalist and later a sub-editor. When Queensland authorities wanted to ban the magazine Packer and Horne successfully fought the injunction in court. ACP followed, in February 1958, with the launch of The Observer, an \\"intellectual magazine\\" where Horne was editor and Packer was his boss. Packer allowed Horne to hire various contributors including Bruce Beresford, Peter Coleman, Robert Hughes, Barry Humphries, and James McAuley. Packer was later the talent manager for Humphries. In 1958 Packer had hired Francis James of Anglican Press to print The Observer but after three years and a run of \\"broken deadlines, overcharges, misprints, [and] slow deliveries\\" Horne and Packer had taken that job away. In 1960 ACP were involved in a commercial rivalry with Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, over interests in print media in Sydney. ACP had made an offer to buy Anglican Press when it was placed in receivership so that they could publish suburban newspapers in opposition to Murdoch's recent acquisitions. In June 1960 the rivalry between the two groups turned into a physical brawl where men hired by Murdoch fought with Packer, Kerry and their associates over the control of Anglican Press building. The Murdoch group had a photographer take evidence of the fracas and their afternoon newspaper, The Daily Mirror, ran a front-page article headlined \\"Knight's Sons in City Brawl\\" with a photo of Packer ejecting the manager of Anglican Press, John Willis, into the street. Also that year Frank bought majority interests in Melbourne TV station GTV-9 which was combined with TCN-9 to form Australia's first national network, Nine Network. In 1961 Packer was promoted to assistant general manager of ACP. During that year two ACP publications Weekend and The Australian Woman's Mirror were merged to form Everybody's with Horne editing and Packer as its manager. In 1965 Packer was made general manager of ACP and founded a record label also called Everybody's as a joint venture with Harry M. Miller (New Zealand-born promoter) and Nat Kipner (record producer and former co-owner of Sunshine Records). However Sydney radio stations were reluctant to play singles issued by that label due to the promotion of ACP's magazine. In January the following year the label was re-launched as Spin Records with Kipner as house producer. During that year Spin Records signed The Bee Gees and issued their hit single, \\"Spicks and Specks\\", which reached No. 4 on the Go-Set National Top 40. During the late-1960s Packer took on more of the administration of Network Nine while Spin Records continued to release singles and albums by various Australian artists. In June 1969 Miller produced the Australian stage version of Hair, a rock musical. Spin Records issued the soundtrack, Hair ‚Äì Australian Cast Soundtrack, by the end of the year, which was banned in Queensland and New Zealand.  Dispute with father  In 1970 Clyde Packer became joint managing director of Nine Network with his father, Frank. Clyde later recalled: \\"[I]t was a very equitable arrangement ... I had the responsibility and he had the authority\\". Late in the next year Clyde Packer launched A Current Affair on the Nine network, with Mike Willesee hosting. In 1972, Willesee organised for A Current Affair to have an on-air interview with then- union leader, Bob Hawke, during an industrial dispute. When Frank heard of the arrangement he vetoed the decision to allow Hawke on his network, undermining Clyde's authority. Willesee later declared: \\"You can't run a current affairs program, as you couldn't run a serious newspaper, and have people tell you you can't have the leader of the Trade Union movement\\". Packer resigned his posts at the Nine Network and ACP, and later reflected on the split: \\"I suspect my father was as glad to get rid of me as I was to get rid of him\\". Their public falling-out followed years of tight control by Frank. According to Paul Barry, \\"Clyde Packer ... was also frequently dressed down and abused in public by his father, Sir Frank. Into his late thirties, Clyde was still treated like a stupid, disobedient little boy, until he could take no more and rebelled against such tyranny, splitting clearly and completely with his father\\". On his father's death in May 1974, the family estate, valued at A$100 million passed directly to Kerry. In 1976, Clyde sold his quarter-share of the family business for A$4 million to Kerry, who went on to become Australia's richest man.  Political career  Clyde Packer had joined the Liberal Party in 1954. He became Vice-President of the Paddington-Waverley branch and a member of the Bligh state electorate conference. On 21 November 1963 he was elected as a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, with his appointment starting on 23 April 1964 and ending on 22 April 1976. Frank had a meeting with then-Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, they discussed a possible diplomatic appointment for Frank which Menzies declined. Menzies helped Packer draft his maiden speech to the parliament. Packer was the Honorary Treasurer of the Children's Surgical Research Fund, a member of New South Wales Society for Crippled Children and New South Wales Committee Council for Civil Liberties. Although a conservative politician, Packer supported freedom of speech, he voted against a bill to ban pornography. During early 1974 he worked with New South Wales Premier, Robert Askin, to develop a series of ads run by John Singleton's agency against the incumbent Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and his Australian Labor Party in the lead up to the federal election in May.  Counter-cultural involvement  After Clyde Packer's resignation from the family's media interests in 1972, he became briefly involved in the counter- culture ‚Äì famously donning a kaftan, claiming that it was \\"better than dieting\\". In the next year Packer established an adult sex magazine, Forum, with Bettina Arndt as consulting editor, and later editor and then publisher. In March that year he explained his motivation for launching the new magazine in the context of changes in the role of sexuality. Note: only an Abstract is available online. He moved to California in 1976 and thereafter rarely returned to Australia. In America, he pursued interests in film, surf culture, and magazine publishing. He bought Surfing Magazine in 1976 and during the mid-1980s he expanded his interests establishing the sister magazines, Bodyboarding Magazine and Volleyball. In 1984 Packer released a book, No Return Ticket, where he interviewed nine fellow Australian expatriates: Robert Hughes, Gordon Chater, Graham Fraser, Dame Judith Anderson, James Wolfensohn, Germaine Greer, Maxwell Newton, Zoe Caldwell, and Sumner Locke Elliott. According to The Canberra Times Mark Thomas the book is a \\"quirky, frothy anachronism\\" where the interviewees \\"whinge about the Australian cultural cringe in terms which no young Australian would find comprehensible\\". Also during 1984 the Costigan Commission issued a draft report into its investigation into the Painters and Dockers Union which implicated a prominent businessman codenamed \\"Goanna\\" in tax evasion and organised crime activities. In September that year news reports published leaked case summaries and Kerry outed himself as \\"Goanna\\" but denied all allegations. When Packer was contacted he observed that his brother \\"had his rights trampled on and his name defamed\\". The Costigan Commission had also contacted the FBI and DEA to investigate Packer's own activities after a US surfing official claimed that one of Packer's local magazines was a front for drug-trafficking. Packer was never officially accused of any wrongdoing related to these investigations. In January 1987 Packer told Ali Cromie from The Sydney Morning Herald that he had left Australia because he \\"would have a better future in America than Australia\\". Initially Packer had made documentaries but most of his subsequent work was in publishing. He also ran a consultancy business, Magazine Investment and Management. Cromie described his relationship with Kerry \\"they got on well without being especially close. He disputes reports that portray their relationship in any other way. 'I had animosity with my father ‚Äì never with my brother'\\".  Personal life  On 25 May 1961 Clyde Packer married Angela May Money (born 9 March 1938). Angela was the elder daughter of Dr. Rex Money, a Macquarie Street specialist and neurosurgeon, and Dorothy \\"Noppy\\" n√©e Wilkinson. The couple were married at All Saints Church, Woollahra with Kerry as best man and David Halliday as groomsman. Clyde and Angela had a son, Francis Clyde Packer. In 1972 Packer and Angela divorced. Packer had relocated to Los Angeles by 1976 where he married his second wife, Kate Clifford, a former model from Brisbane, on 7 July 1977. By 1987 Clyde and Kate were living in the Santa Barbara suburb of Montecito. Clyde developed heart and kidney problems. He was on a dialysis machine for treatment and had a kidney donated from his architect. From 1999 he had been bedridden for two years. (Kerry also had heart and kidney problems and obtained a new kidney from his helicopter pilot.) Robert Clyde Packer died on 8 April 2001, aged 65. He died of heart and lung failure. A memorial for Packer was held in Sydney on 16 May 2001 with a eulogy \\"Dear Clyde\\" which was written by Barry Humphries and read by Packer's son, Francis. Other speakers at the memorial were John Laws, Harry M. Miller and Peter Coleman. In the TV mini-series, Power Games: The Packer- Murdoch War (September 2013), Clyde Packer was portrayed by Alexander England.

The name is sometimes translated as \\"chart of the constellations and the regions they govern.\\" King Taejo ordered royal astronomers to carve the constellations on a flat black stone in December 1395. The stone is about 122.5 cm in width, 211 cm in height, and 12 cm in depth. The engraved stone shows the 1,467 stars visible from Korea, 264 constellations and their names, the ecliptic and equatorial lines, and 365 scales around. It was compiled through a combination of a Goguryeo star map with more recent observations. The chart shows positions of the heavenly bodies in their natural order and allocated on their respective celestial fields. Its map projection law is found to be the polar equatorial and equidistance projection : the linear distance of an object on the map from the center is lineally proportional to the north polar angular distance. The epoch of the stellar positions is estimated to be near the First Century for the stars with declination less than fifty degrees, and to be near 1395 AD for stars with declination higher than fifty degrees. This map became standard during the Joseon dynasty, with numerous copies printed and disseminated throughout the kingdom, until it was superseded by Western planispheres in the nineteenth century. The map is the 228th national treasure of South Korea, and is exhibited at the National Palace Museum in Seoul.

Biography Ross was born at Balnagown Castle, the son of Sir Charles William Frederick Augustus Lockhart-Ross, 8th Baronet and his second wife, Rebecca Sophia Barnes of Tufnell Park. He inherited the Baronetcy on the death of his father in 1883 when he was aged 11. He was educated at Eton College and while he was there his mother's indulgences on him included \\"a magnificent ocean-going steam yacht, a large sailing yacht, the most superbly appointed and biggest steam launch for river use on the Thames, and a coach and four\\". When he came of age he instituted a lawsuit against his mother for having, during his minority, spent more of the revenues of his estates than she was entitled to by law or by the terms of the will.Leigh Rayment Baronets He was then at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1894 he rowed in the Cambridge boat in the Boat Race. He was known as a capable sharpshooter and big game hunter. Ross became a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, the Seaforth Highlanders and served in the Second Anglo-Boer War. He designed the Ross rifle, which was initially used by his own Machine Gun Battery during the Boer War. He was a captain in Lovat Scouts Yeomanry from 1904 to 1913. He was an advisor on small arms to the Canadian Government and he designed and built the plant of the West Kootenay Power and Light Co. on the Kootenay River at Bonnington Falls. During World War I his Ross rifle was mass-produced for the Canadian army. Sporting rifles bearing the Ross name were also popular for a time after the First World War, as was the .280 (approximately 7 mm) Ross sporting rifle cartridge. Ross was said to have been Britain's largest landowner, possessing Scottish lands extending to an estimated , with 3,000 tenants. At one point, in an attempt to evade United Kingdom taxation on the income from his arms manufacturing, Ross declared his Easter Ross, Scotland estate of Balnagown to be a territory of the United States of America, which led to his being branded an outlaw for a time by the British Government. Ross married three times: first to Winifred Berens (marriage dissolved in 1897); then to Patricia Ellison, who divorced him in 1930; and, in 1938, to his American secretary Dorothy Mercado. On Ross's death aged 70 in St. Petersburg, Florida, Dorothy inherited Balnagown Castle. Balnagown Castle, not far from the north shore of the Cromarty Firth near Invergordon, and adjacent parts of the once-extensive Ross estate of Balnagown have been owned since 1972 by billionaire businessman and former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, who has restored the castle.

This is their last album to feature Danny Kirwan, who was fired during the album's supporting tour. In the wake of the band's success in the mid-1970s, Bare Trees peaked at number 70 on US Billboard 200 chart. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1988. Mick Fleetwood was particularly impressed with Kirwan's contributions to the album. \\"It's a well-rounded album. Like Lindsey, Danny had the chops with layering techniques, and the ability to know what's right and wrong in the studio.\\" Track notes \\"Child of Mine\\" alludes to Kirwan's biological father not having been part of his life (Kirwan was his stepfather's surname). \\"The Ghost\\" was later re-recorded by Bob Welch for His Fleetwood Mac Years and Beyond, Vol. 2 in 2006, albeit this version was only available on the digital edition. \\"Homeward Bound\\" alludes to Christine McVie's then dislike of flying and touring, also alluded to in her 1997 track Temporary One. \\"Sunny Side of Heaven\\" was an instrumental, which, at the time, was mixed in with some radio station sign-offs. The piece was also performed with Lindsey Buckingham on guitar for some shows in the mid 1970s. \\"Bare Trees\\" shares a theme both with the album's cover photography by John McVie and the closing poem \\"Thoughts On a Grey Day\\" \\"Sentimental Lady\\" was released as a single. It was later re-recorded by its composer Bob Welch (with Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, and Lindsey Buckingham backing him) for his solo album French Kiss. Welch would record the song again for His Fleetwood Mac Years & Beyond in 2003. \\"Danny's Chant\\" features the use of wah-wah guitars. The title is somewhat ironic in that the track is largely an instrumental, although it does have rhythmic, non-verbal backing vocals in the mix. \\"Spare Me a Little of Your Love\\" became a staple of the band's live act from 1972‚Äì1977. It was also covered by Johnny Rivers on his studio album New Lovers and Old Friends in 1975. Jackie DeShannon recorded a version for her 1972 album Jackie although this did not make the final cut and was not released until 2015. The lyrics for \\"Dust\\" were taken from a poem about death written by Rupert Brooke in 1910.Dust By Rupert Brooke Unlike W H Davies who received a credit for the words to Dragonfly, Brooke was not credited here as his copyright had expired. The final track on the album, \\"Thoughts on a Grey Day\\", is not a Fleetwood Mac song, but a monaural recorded poem written and supposedly read by an elderly woman, Mrs. Scarrott, who lived near the band's communal home, 'Benifold', in southern England. Bob Welch, however, said in a Penguin Q&A; in 1999, \\"The spoken thing Mick does about 'Trees so bare' was written, I think, by this sweet old lady that lived near Benifold ... Mick did an affectionate 'schtick' on her to close the album.\\" Five of the ten tracks were penned by Kirwan. \\"Trinity\\", another Kirwan song recorded at the sessions, was subsequently released in 1992 on the 25 Years ‚Äì The Chain box set. Commercial performance Bare Trees debuted at number 175 on US Billboard 200 chart dated 22 April 1972. The album reached its peak at number 70 on the chart dated 3 June 1972, after being on the chart for seven weeks. The album ultimately spent a total of 27 weeks on the chart. On 9 February 1988, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over a million copies in the United States.

C. Packer, was the founder of Australia's Packer media dynasty, which would later own Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) and now owns holds a controlling interest in Crown Resorts through Consolidated Press Holdings. Early life Packer was born in Tasmania, the son of a senior customs official, Arthur Howard Packer (died 20 August 1912) and Margaret Fitzmaurice Packer (n√©e Clyde; 1855‚Äì1915). Arthur Packer was a son of Frederick Alexander Packer and his wife Augusta (n√©e Gow). Both were members of the Royal Academy of Music in London and had arrived in Hobart in 1852 so that Frederick could take up the position of organist at St. David's Cathedral in Davey Street. The Packers were originally from the Reading area in the Thames Valley and Frederick's father was a master pianoforte manufacturer who plied his trade for many years on London's Oxford Street. Augusta was the granddaughter of Scotland's famous fiddler and composer of antiquity, Niel Gow of Dunkeld. Her father was Nathaniel Gow, a highly regarded musician and composer himself, who had a shop in Princes Street, Edinburgh in the early to mid-1800s. Career R.C., as he came to be called, became a journalist first in Hobart, later in Cairns, Bellingen, Macksville, Tamworth, Dubbo (where he edited The Dubbo Liberal, owned by a young widow) and finally Sydney in 1908, where he joined the staff of the Sunday Times, became editor in 1913, then sub-editor with The Sydney Sun. In 1918 he joined with James Joynton Smith and Claude McKay in the foundation of Smith's Weekly, followed in 1923 by the Daily Guardian (both now defunct but at the time highly profitable with circulations in the hundreds of thousands). Notable achievements included launching the first Miss Australia beauty contest at the Daily Guardian in 1926. He left Smith's Weekly in 1930 in possession of a half share in the paper (he had helped purchase McKay's interest in 1927) and substantial holdings in Australian Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Telegraph and The Sunday Sun (who had bought out the Daily Guardian and Sunday Guardian in 1929). Personal life Robert Clyde Packer married Ethel Maud Hewson (1874‚Äì1947), the youngest daughter of Rev. Frank Hewson, on 13 July 1903 at St. Matthias Church, Paddington, New South Wales. They had two children; Frank Packer (1906‚Äì1974) and Kathleen Mary Packer (1910‚Äì2000), known later as Lady Stening, wife of Sir George Stening (1904‚Äì1996). Packer died of heart failure at age 54 while driving the P & O ship, RMS Maloja. The ship was cruising on the Mediterranean at the time. Packer was pronounced dead at Marseille, France and his son Frank inherited his publishing interests, expanding them into a formidable media empire, which was expanded still further by Frank's son Kerry and grandson, James. He was buried on 21 May 1934 in the Packer family mausoleum at South Head Cemetery. He left an estate valued at ‚Ç§54,706 to his wife, son and daughter. His wife, Ethel Packer died in Wellington, New Zealand on 1 April 1947, aged 72 years. According to Gerald Stone, in Compulsive Viewing, the Packer fortune is reputed to have been founded on a stroke of luck, when he found 10 shillings at a Tasmanian race track and put it on a winning horse at twelve to one. It was enough to pay his way to the mainland, to begin his newspaper career.

Robinson was one of the few wrestlers who was successful in several continents (Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania), winning titles in promotions nearly everywhere he wrestled. One of the leading practitioners of catch wrestling, Robinson is considered to be one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Robinson was also well known in Japan where he trained mixed martial artists and professional wrestlers in catch wrestling. Career=Early days in Europe Robinson began his amateur wrestling career in Britain. He was the British National Wrestling Champion in 1957, and in 1958 he was the European Open Wrestling Champion in the light heavyweight class, beating an Olympic bronze medal winner in the finals. Billy Robinson also attended the fabled wrestling gym of legendary trainer Billy Riley in Wigan, (nicknamed the \\"Snake Pit\\" - years later, affiliate \\"Snake Pit\\" gyms would later be established in Japan and the United States.) Riley's Gym was one of the most respected catch wrestling training schools in all of the world. Legends such as Karl Gotch had trained in catch wrestling with Riley at his gym. Robinson had to survive bare minimum amenities (luxuries such as a toilet were not provided at Riley's Gym), a very rough training environment (Riley was very impatient with those who showed even the slightest bit of weakness on the mat) and rigorous conditioning. Robinson stayed at the \\"Snake Pit\\" for eight years. As a professional wrestler, Robinson was an undefeated double-crown British and European Heavyweight Champion for Joint Promotions. He defeated older fellow Snake Pit wrestler Billy Joyce for the European title on 12 June 1965 and then beat Joyce again for the British title on 18 January 1967, vacating both titles in 1970 when he went off to America. He also had a high-profile feud with legendary masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki. In 1978, Robinson made a brief homecoming tour of the UK including a televised win over Lee Bronson. In North America Robinson traveled to North America in 1970 and began wrestling for Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association. He was one of the successful wrestlers of the American promotion known for hiring the \\"Real Deals\\" in wrestling. Billy Robinson was also the AWA British Empire Heavyweight Champion; he defended the title in both the United States and Canada, winning on 3 separate occasions. 12 October 1974 Robinson's image as a legitimate wrestler landed him a role in the film The Wrestler alongside Verne Gagne and Ed Asner. He wrestled in Montreal in 1982 and 1983 becoming the International Champion beating Dino Bravo and was also International Tag Team champions with Pierre Mad Dog Lefebvre. He wrestled to a 60-minutes time-limit draw against then WWWF Champion Bob Backlund in 1982 as well in Montreal. Japan Robinson travelled to Japan where he became immensely popular as a legitimate wrestler versed in submission holds. He participated in a professional wrestling match against legendary Antonio Inoki in 1975. The match was billed as \\"The Match Between the World's Top Two Technicians\\" by the Japanese press. Robinson continued an active professional wrestling career, travelling throughout the world to participate in various events. Japanese professional wrestlers learned the art of \\"hooking\\" and \\"shooting\\" from another of catch wrestling's greatest icons, Karl Gotch. The new movement led to the formation of the Universal Wrestling Federation. The UWF had wrestlers like Yoshiaki Fujiwara who had also been to the Snake Pit in Wigan. Robinson became a part of the shoot style movement when he wrestled in an exhibition match for the UWFi against fellow AWA legend Nick Bockwinkel on May 8, 1992. Post-retirement Robinson, having previously trained wrestlers in England including Marty Jones and Johnny Saint, began training wrestlers in catch wrestling at the UWF Snake Pit in Japan, including James Maritato, Kazushi Sakuraba and El Signo.

The elevation of Drift Creek ranges from , and is characterized by long steep slopes with broken and uneven terrain.Drift Creek Wilderness, Oregon - GORP Drift Creek was named for the accumulations of driftwood on its banks. Human history Natives of the Alsea tribe used to hunt and gather berries in Drift Creek Wilderness and the surrounding area. Later, in the early 20th century, American settlers tried unsuccessfully to homestead the wilderness. Fred Purath operated a subsistence farm and ran a few head of cattle. When he died in the early 1940s his land was purchased by Earl Harris. The only relic of the so-called Harris Ranch homestead is a moss-covered stove and stove parts along the Harris Ranch Trail.Central Oregon Wilderness Areas (Cascades to the Coast), by Donna Aitkenhead, pp. 28, 31, 33 Vegetation Salal (Gaultheria shallon) Drift Creek Wilderness generally receives some of rain per year, which leads to a very lush environment. It contains one of the largest remaining stands of old growth in the Coast Range.Drift Creek Wilderness - Wilderness.net Sitka spruce, western hemlock, western red cedar, and Douglas fir dominate the area, but bigleaf maple and red alder can be found as well. Much of the underbrush is licorice fern, oxalis, salmonberry, thimbleberry, huckleberry, foxglove, trillium, sword fern, and salal. Wildlife Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and black bear share Drift Creek Wilderness with two endangered Oregon species - the northern spotted owl and the bald eagle. In autumn, Chinook and coho salmon, as well as steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout use Drift Creek, a tributary of the Alsea River, to spawn.

It was recorded in the summer of 1971 at Advision Studios in London and was the first album to feature Christine McVie as a full member. This album was also the first of five albums to feature American guitarist Bob Welch. ‚ÄúHe was totally different background ‚Äì R&B;, sort of jazzy. He brought his personality,‚Äù Mick Fleetwood said of Welch in a 1995 BBC interview. ‚ÄúHe was a member of Fleetwood Mac before we‚Äôd even played a note.‚Äù The album peaked at number 91 on the US Billboard 200 chart dated 18 December 1971. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2000. Background Without the 1950s leanings of departed guitarist Jeremy Spencer, the band moved further away from blues and closer to the melodic pop sound that would finally break them into America four years later. After the band completed the album and turned it in, the record label said that it would not release an album with only seven songs, and demanded that they record an eighth. \\"What a Shame\\" was recorded hastily as a jam to fulfill this request. Welch's primary guitar at the time was a Gibson ES-335, which he played on the record along with a Fender Stratocaster. Track notes There is an early version of \\"Morning Rain\\" with the title \\"Start Again\\", as recorded in a BBC session on 5 January 1971. \\"What a Shame\\" featured saxophone from Christine McVie's brother John Perfect whose son Dan later co-produced and featured as guitarist/co-writer on McVie's 2004 album In the Meantime. The title track, written by then-newcomer Bob Welch, was later re-recorded for his 1979 solo album The Other One and again for His Fleetwood Mac Years & Beyond in 2003. The original version is featured in the 2000 movie Almost Famous. A heavily edited version of \\"Sands of Time\\" was an unsuccessful single in the United States and some other territories. This version was also released on the deluxe edition of the 50 Years ‚Äì Don't Stop compilation in 2018. An alternate version of \\"Lay It All Down\\" appeared on the 1992 compilation 25 Years ‚Äì The Chain. Artwork Early UK releases of this album, and some non-UK issues, have a yellow background to the picture of the two children and cover text. All subsequent releases have a green background. The 2013 vinyl reissue by Warner/Rhino available in the Fleetwood Mac: 1969 to 1972 4-LP box set restores the original yellow background to the album artwork and it was released as a standalone LP two years later. Commercial performance Future Games debuted at number 186 on the US Billboard 200 chart dated 30 October 1971. The album reached its peak at number 91 on the chart dated 18 December 1971, after being on the chart for eight weeks. The album ultimately spent a total of 12 weeks on the chart. On 4 October 2000, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. Track listing The song timings listed here are not as indicated on all CDs, since some of the timings on some releases are inaccurate.

History It was founded and endowed in 1024 by Pfalzgraf Ezzo, count palatine of Lotharingia of the Ezzonian dynasty and his wife Matilda of Germany, a daughter of Emperor Otto II and Theophano. Ezzo and Matilda were buried here, as were their two eldest sons Liudolf, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (d. 1031) and Otto II, Duke of Swabia (d. 1047). From 1065 until his death in 1091, Wolfhelm of Brauweiler, later Saint Wolfhelm, was abbot here. His relics were enshrined in the abbey church, and miracles were reported at his tomb,Heinz Erich Stiene (translator of the medieval original by Konrad of Brauweiler) (1992), Vita Wolfhelmi: Leben des Abtes Wolfhelm von Brauweiler but all traces of them were lost centuries ago. The present abbey church, now the parish church of Saint Nicholas and Saint Medardus, is the third building on the site, built between 1136 and 1220 or later. The abbey was dissolved in the secularisation of 1803. The premises were subsequently used, under a Napoleonic law, as a hostel for beggars, and from 1815 under the Prussian regime as a workhouse. From 1933 to 1945 the buildings were used for the internment, torture, and murder of political and social \\"undesirables\\" by the Gestapo and the civil authorities of the Nazi government. Prisoners included Konrad Adenauer, the former mayor of Cologne and first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Serving up to 5,000 meals a day, this restaurant covers a floor area of 15,000 square meters with over forty private dining rooms and can simultaneously seat 2,000 guests. Having established a history and affiliation with the Chinese government at the municipal and central state level, Quanjude has often been used to hold state banquets and to receive celebrities, dignitaries, and important government figures from over 200 countries as distinguished VIP guests. During the APEC banquet held at the Water Cube in Beijing on Nov 10th 2014, eight chefs from Quanjude Group performed a live demonstration on how to carve Peking duck. = Hong Kong = There is one Quanjude branch in Hong Kong, in Tsim Sha Tsui, where it is known as \\"Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant (ÂÖ®ËÅöÂæ∑ÁÉ§È¥®Â∫ó)\\".  Outside China  In 2017, the first branch outside of China and Taiwan opened in Melbourne, Australia. Since then another has opened in Sydney in 2018. QJD also has a restaurant in Toronto, Canada and Lisbon, Portugal. The chain also has three restaurants in Tokyo, Japan.  History  Quanjude was established in 1864 during the Qing Dynasty under the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor. Although Peking Duck can trace its history many centuries back, Quanjude's heritage of roast duck preparation ‚Äì using open ovens and non-smoky hardwood fuel such as Chinese date, peach, or pear to add a subtle fruity flavor with a golden crisp to the skin ‚Äì was originally reserved for the imperial families. The first Quanjude manager, Yang Renquan, who started out selling chicken and ducks, paid a retired chef from the palace for the imperial recipe. Soon after, Quanjude began to serve roast duck from the imperial kitchen to the common masses. Yang Renquan opened his first, small Dejuquan (Âæ∑ËÅöÂÖ®, the three characters being reversed from the current name) inside Yangrou Hutong in Qianmen (ÂâçÈñÄ), which at the time was one of the busiest areas in Beijing. His restaurant became an instant success and has since grown into the current branch in Qianmen that employs over 400 staff members and can occupy 900 guests at one time. The Qianmen restaurant, along with the many other Quanjude branches, together form one of the largest food enterprises in the nation. On 19 August 1966 Red Guards from 2nd, 25th and 63rd Middle Schools raided the restaurant, smashing the original antique restaurant sign and replacing with a modern one reading \\"Beijing Roast Duck Restaurant\\" as part of the Cultural Revolution \\"Smash the Four Olds\\" campaign.

At one time he held the Guinness World Record for most film appearances (more than 600). By his own count, he's made more than 2,000 films and television shows, including lakorns (Thai soap operas). A prolific leading man in action films, romance, dramas, comedies and musicals at the height of his career in the 1960s and 1970s, he continues to act in Thai films and in television series, making frequent appearances on talk shows and in TV commercials. Among his recent films are Tears of the Black Tiger and The Legend of Suriyothai. He got Bachelor of Business Administration from Petchaburi Rajabhat, master and doctoral of Political Sciences from Eastern Asia University. Biography=Early life Sombat was born in Ubon Ratchathani, which is the birthplace of his mother. But after he was born just seven days, his family moved to settle in Bangkok's Saphan On neighbourhood in Pathum Wan district near Hua Lamphong railway station, since his father worked at the Railway Department (compared to the present State Railway of Thailand (SRT)). So he is considered a Bangkokian implicitly. After he graduated and was enlisted, while he was looking for work at the Wang Burapha area. He was persuaded to enter the show business. For family life Sombat was married before becoming an actor. Early films Sombat was introduced to the show business in 1960 by Namdee Witta, the leader of a television performance troupe. He starred in the television series Hua Jai Pratana (Heart's Desires). His physical attractiveness caught the eye of Noi Kamolwatin, a film director from the Kamolsilpa Pappayon studio. Noi cast Sombat in Roong Petch (Diamond Rainbow), which opened at the Empire Theatre in Bangkok and became a huge success. With a fine-sculpted body, brawny face and slicked-back, pomaded hair, Sombat was a popular leading man, with both men and woman writing him fan letters. \\"I never thought of acting, but I was good-looking, smart; I had sex appeal,\\" Sombat said in 2006 in an interview with ThaiDay.Li Min, Lim (February 23, 2006). \\"The First Metrosexual\\". ThaiDay (retrieved on November 30, 2006). Sombat went on to star in four more Kamolsilpa Pappyon films: Skao Duen in 1962 and Singh Sang Pa, Saming Sao and Nagm-Ngon, all released in 1963. He was then picked up by director Tawee Na Bangchang (better known as Kru Marut) to star in Tawan Lang Lued (Blood of the Sun). He also appeared in Kao Mangkorn (Nine Dragons), directed by Warun Chatrakul Na Ayutthaya. He was cast by his old talent scout, Namdee Witta, in the action film Singh La Singh (The Lion vs The Lion), in which he co-starred with Mitr Chaibancha, who was Thailand's top leading man at the time. Top leading man Often performing his own stunts, Sombat was an action star very much in the same mold as Mitr Chaibancha. And after Mitr's accidental death in 1970, Sombat became the top Thai leading man, often sharing the screen with Mitr's frequent co-star, Petchara Chaowarat, such as the 1971 musical comedy, Ai Tui (Mr. Tui), directed by Dokdin Kanyamarn. He was mainly paired with Aranya Namwong, though, and they replaced Mitr and Petchara as Thailand's top screen couple. In 1966, Sombat won a \\"Golden Doll\\", Thailand's equivalent at the time to the Academy Award, for best actor in Suek Bang Rajan (The Battle of Bang Rajan). He received the statuette from King Bhumibol himself. In 1973, he established Metanee Film, which lasted five years and made 23 films. Among them was the action-comedy Nak Leng Tewada (The Holy Hoodlum) in 1975. Other films from the 1970s include the violent prison drama, Narok Tarutao (The Hell of Tarutao), directed by Ruj Ronaphop, and the historical epic, Khun Suk (War Lord), directed by Sakka Jarujinda. He played a cowboy in The Reluctant Gunman (Mue Peun Khia), a gangster in Louie, romanced Aranya Namwong in Chain of Love, was the Man With a Thousand Masks and controlled robot assassins in Nak Leng Computer (Gangster Computer). In another film, 1976's Choompae, he portrayed a brutal anti-hero. Recent work With age, Sombat graduated away from the hero roles, playing the role of the heavy. He was the leading villain in the 2000 Thai western, Tears of the Black Tiger, a film that paid homage to the action films he starred in during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to Tears of the Black Tiger, he was among an all-star Thai cast in Chatrichalerm Yukol's The Legend of Suriyothai. He had a small comedic role in the 2004 comedy, Bangkok Loco and played a senior police officer in the 2005 horror-comedy, Buppah Rahtree Phase 2: Rahtree Returns.

This is the first album after the departure of founder Peter Green, and their last album to feature guitarist Jeremy Spencer. Christine McVie was present at the recording sessions and contributed backing vocals, keyboards and cover art, although she was not a full member of the band until shortly after the album's completion. Background The album title is taken from the name of a converted Oast house in Truncheaunts Lane, near Alton in Hampshire (UK). The house was leased by the band, who lived there communally with their families for a six-month period in 1970. Mick Fleetwood was married to his wife at the house on 20 June 1970. Spencer, who sat out for the previous album, Then Play On, played a much more active role during the Kiln House sessions. His retro 1950s homages and parodies dominate the album, although Danny Kirwan's songs are almost equally prominent. \\"Buddy's Song\\" is a partial cover of \\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" with new lyrics listing a number of Buddy Holly song titles.

AMO is the world's largest civilian aviation and maritime law enforcement organization. Its mission is to protect the American people and nation's critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of air and marine assets to detect, interdict and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States. Air and Marine Operations Agents and Officers are endowed with the authority to enforce Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) and Title 19 (Customs) of the United States Code in addition to the general law enforcement powers bestowed upon federal law enforcement agents. This specialized law enforcement capability allows AMO to make significant contributions to the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as to those of other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. AMO is uniquely positioned to provide direct air and maritime support to multiple agencies and to ensure the success of border protection and law enforcement operations between ports of entry, within the maritime domain and within the nation's interior. To accomplish its mission, AMO employs over 1,200 Federal Agents and Officers at 70 locations, operating more than 260 aircraft of 26 different types, and approximately 300 maritime vessels. It is one of the major operational components within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Office of Field Operations (OFO) and United States Border Patrol (USBP).http://www.gao.gov/assets/590/589797.pdfhttp://nemo.cbp.gov/obp/am_sfx.wmv History and Consolidation *1789 - The U.S. Customs Service (USCS) is established to aid in the protection of the revenue of the United States and to prevent the smuggling of contraband. A fleet of vessels begin to patrol the coastal waters of the United States. Congress authorized the Collector of Customs to acquire boats and hire boatsmen. These vessels and boatsmen were the forerunners of today's Midnight Express Interceptor vessels and Marine Interdiction Agents. *1808 - Boatsmen Asa March and Elis Drake became the first Customs officers to die in the line of duty. They gave their lives during a marine interdiction and subsequent gunfight on Lake Champlain in New York. *1922 - U.S. Customs Service Patrol began to use seized aircraft to enable aerial surveillance and enforcement. *1932 - A record-high 35 aircraft were seized for smuggling. This led to the establishment of an unofficial Customs Patrol Air Group. The new aerial surveillance effort focused on the southern U.S. border. *1969 - The U.S. Customs Service officially established its aviation program, which became operational in 1971. *1973 - The U.S. Customs Service's marine program was established in its modern form within the USCS Office of Investigations. *1999 - The USCS Air and Marine Interdiction Division (AMID) was formed by merging the aviation and marine programs. *March 1, 2003 - Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the U.S. Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) were abolished, and their components were transferred to newly formed agencies within the Department of Homeland Security. The USCS Air and Marine Interdiction Division was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), becoming the Office of Air and Marine Operations (AMO). The U.S. Border Patrol with its aviation and marine assets was transferred from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, becoming the Office of Border Patrol.https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/hr_5005_enr.pdf *October 23, 2004 - ICE Air and Marine Operations was transferred to U.S. Customs and Border Protection due to political and budgetary disputes between ICE and CBP.http://www.govexec.com/magazine/features/2006/03/management- mess/21284/http://www.govexec.com/magazine/features/2006/03/wasted-year/21283/ *October 1, 2005 - U.S. Customs and Border Protection integrated its Air and Marine Operations and Border Patrol aviation assets and personnel to more effectively accomplish its aviation missions, forming the Office of CBP Air.http://www.hsdl.org/?view&did;=11003 *January 17, 2006 - U.S. Customs and Border Protection consolidated all aviation and marine assets under the newly titled Office of Air and Marine, which has the responsibility of providing training, creating standard operating procedures, as well as procuring and maintaining equipment for the entirety of CBP's aviation and marine programs. The purpose of these consolidations was to align air and marine law enforcement personnel and assets into one agency, enabling them to better accomplish the new homeland security mission. *October 1, 2015 - U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Air and Marine changed its name to Air and Marine Operations. Missions AW-139 helicopter and two 39' Midnight Express interceptors Among AMO's many missions are anti- terrorism, countering smuggling, and stopping illegal immigration. The agency uses its aviation and marine assets to detect, interdict, and apprehend conveyances carrying terrorists, contraband, or undocumented aliens intending to enter the United States illegally. AMO Also leverages its unique detection and interdiction capabilities to support individual components of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice. Providing support to agencies and multi-jurisdictional task forces such as ICE Homeland Security Investigations, the United States Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection, the United States Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Special Security Events, and Joint Interagency Task Force South accounts for the bulk of AMO operations. To accomplish its missions, AMO uses a multitude of fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unarmed versions of military UAVs, as well as high speed blue water interceptors and utility vessels for strategic operations in high-risk areas. All CBP aviation missions are conducted by Air Interdiction Agents, while CBP maritime operations in the Great Lakes, territorial waters, and international waters are the responsibility of Marine Interdiction Agents. Patrol Agents from the Office of Border Patrol are responsible for conducting U.S. Customs and Border Protection's marine missions in the small lakes and rivers along the Mexico‚ÄìUS and Canada‚ÄìUS borders. Air and Marine Operations Agents and Officers work with both U.S. and foreign agencies and military forces to support their law enforcement efforts. Personnel and assets are deployed abroad to support Department of Homeland Security priorities, most notably for foreign training and counter narcotics missions. Aviation resources=Fixed wingBeechcraft King Air C-12= Beechcraft King Air C-12. The Beechcraft King Air, C-12B, C-12C, and C-12M maritime surveillance aircraft are all medium- range, twin turbo-prop aircraft used by CBP's Air and Marine Operations. These aircraft support investigation and enforcement efforts by conducting surveillance, tracking, and information gathering missions with equipment designed for those specific mission sets to include over water operations. Their secondary mission is the logistical relocation of personnel, equipment, or evidence that is time critical to investigation and enforcement actions. As an interdiction tracker, this aircraft can play a role in drug interdiction missions when accompanied by a C-550 Citation II or a P-3 aircraft flying as a radar platform or an interceptor.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/c12_beechcraft_factsheet.ctt/c12_beechcraft_factsheet.pdf =Beechcraft Super King Air 350ER= Beechcraft Super King Air 350ER. The latest addition to the CBP Air and Marine Operations fleet of aircraft is the multi-purpose, fixed-wing, multi-engine Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA). The MEA will perform marine interdiction, limited air-to-air interdiction, over land interdiction, and enforcement relocation of personnel and equipment. The MEA will also be configured to carry law enforcement technical collections equipment. AMO's MEA, which will fly with a crew of four (two pilots and two sensor operators), will eventually replace AMO's current array of C-12M, PA-42, C-12C, and B-200 aircraft. The MEA is equipped with state of the art sensor equipment for detection, tracking, and surveillance operations in regions where terrain, weather, and distance pose significant obstacles to border security operations. In addition, the MEA serves as a force multiplier for law enforcement and emergency personnel because it provides a rapid- response deployment capability.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/350er_king_air_factsheet.ctt/350er_king_air_factsheet.pdf =Bombardier DHC-8Q200= Bombardier DHC-8Q200. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q200 is a multirole patrol aircraft (MPA) equipped with multimode radar and electro-optical/infrared sensors that can detect and track maritime and surface targets. It can also be converted to a cargo configuration or into a 37-passenger aircraft, making it an ideal aircraft to respond to acts of terrorism, natural disasters and other emergencies. The first AMO Dash 8 Q200 MPA was placed in service in August 2005 and was used extensively during the days following Hurricane Katrina to carry law enforcement officers, flight crews and other personnel, supplies and equipment to New Orleans. A second Dash 8 was delivered in mid 2006 and a third aircraft was delivered in February 2008. The fourth aircraft was delivered in December 2008. AMO also utilizes Dash-8 Q300 MPAs. All AMO Dash-8's employ powerful surface search radar, cameras, advanced tracking software and other sensor equipment to secure America's maritime border. AMO's Dash-8's are widely recognized as some of the most capable and powerful maritime patrol aircraft in the world.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/dhc8_bombardier_factsheet.ctt/dhc8_bombardier_factsheet.pdf =Cessna C-172, C-182, C-206, and C-210= Cessna C-206. The C-172/182/206/210 surveillance aircraft are short to medium-range piston- powered aircraft used by the Air and Marine Operations to support investigative and enforcement efforts by conducting surveillance, tracking, photographic and information gathering missions. Their secondary mission is the logistical relocation of personnel, equipment or evidence that are time critical to investigative and enforcement actions. These surveillance aircraft, which fly with a crew of two (pilot and observer), are particularly effective platforms for law enforcement operations. They provide better range and endurance than helicopters and blend more effectively with local traffic to mask the presence of continuous air surveillance.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/c172_182_cessna_factsheet.ctt/c172_182_cessna_factsheet.pdfhttp://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/c206_210_cessna_factsheet.ctt/c206_210_cessna_factsheet.pdf =Cessna C-550 Citation II= Cessna C-550 Citation II. C-550 Citation II Interceptor aircraft were all-weather tactical jets used by CBP Air and Marine to intercept and track airborne drug smugglers and to enforce airspace security over critical venues. The Citation has also been used effectively in Panama, Honduras, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, and Aruba. AMO Began using the Cessna Citation in the late 1970s as a high-speed interceptor and tracker. AMO Citation Interceptors, which fly with a crew of three (pilot, copilot, and sensor operator), have the ability to operate from remote landing strips. The Citation II were the first commercial aircraft fitted with fire- control radar from the USAF F-16 Falcon, to be used in a law enforcement capacity. The Citation II was retired from service in 2019. http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/c550_cessna_factsheet.ctt/c550_cessna_factsheet.pdf =Lockheed P-3 Orion Long Range Tracker= Lockheed P-3 Orion Long Range Tracker. The P-3 LRT aircraft are high-endurance, all-weather, tactical turbo- prop aircraft used by CBP Air and Marine to intercept and track airborne smuggling threats. With the escalation of terrorist threats and the commitment of Department of Defense P-3 Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft in other regions of the world, AMO P-3s have assumed a significant role in Homeland Security efforts. Key to the success of the P-3s are their endurance, small deployment footprint, and extensive sensor array. The aircraft can operate from most 8,000-foot runways and carries a crew of eight (pilot, copilot, flight engineer, and radar and sensor operators). The aircraft are supported by a ground maintenance team of only three people. AMO P-3 LRT aircraft often fly in tandem with the P-3 AEW. Used in this manner, the P-3 AEW detects and tracks multiple targets and the accompanying P-3 LRT intercepts, identifies, and tracks those suspect targets.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/nsa/p3_lrt_factsheet.ctt/p3_lrt_factsheet.pdf =Lockheed P-3 Orion Airborne Early Warning= Lockheed P-3 Orion Airborne Early Warning. The P-3 Airborne Early Warning (AEW) detection and monitoring aircraft are the only dedicated law enforcement AEW aircraft in the world. They were developed to provide wide area search, increased command control, and communications capabilities. Air and Marine's P-3s are high-endurance, all-weather, tactical turbo-prop aircraft, which are used primarily for long- range patrols along the entire U.S. border, and in source and transit zone countries throughout Central and South America. The aircraft carries a crew of eight (pilot, copilot, flight engineer, and radar/sensor operators). They are routinely sent on temporary duty to support the United States and foreign government initiatives to stem smuggling into the United States. With the escalation of terrorist threats and the commitment of Department of Defense AEW assets in other regions of the world, Air and Marine P-3s have also assumed a significant role in Homeland Security efforts.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/nsa/p3b_aew_factsheet.ctt/p3b_aew_factsheet.pdf =MQ-9 Predator B Unmanned Aircraft System= The MQ-9 Predator B Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) is a force multiplier for CBP and its border security mission. AMO UASs began their service by supporting Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers on the U.S./Mexico border. In January 2009, UAS operations began on the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In addition, the MQ-9 allows CBP to assist with non border related operations within other DHS organizations like the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, such as search and rescue or disaster relief. AMO Works closely with the Department of Defense to gain efficiencies in acquisition, testing, training and deployment of the Predator B. CBP selected the Predator B for its large payload and ability to remain in the air longer than other UASs. CBP's Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC) at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, CA provides liaison from the UAS to other agencies within and outside of CBP. Command and control of the UAS is through KU-band satellite communications.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/uas/predator_b.xml/predator_b.pdfhttp://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/uas/guardian_b.ctt/guardian_b.pdf =Pilatus PC-12= Pilatus PC-12. The PC-12 is a single-engine turbo-prop aircraft that combines the slow-speed capability of a Cessna 210 with the payload and high-speed capabilities of a B-200 King Air. These characteristics enable the Multirole Enforcement Aircraft to deploy rapidly and operate safely in remote areas. These aircraft have enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of CBP's Air and Marine Operations by providing: *Increased mission versatility, including air interdiction, aerial surveillance and logistical support. *Removable sensor consoles and retractable state of-the-art electro- optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensors. *Reduced operating costs. Key to the success of the PC-12s, which fly with a crew of two (pilot and sensor operator), are their endurance, small deployment footprint, and extensive sensor array. The aircraft have short-field capabilities of mission take-off in 2,300 ft and landing distance of 1,800 ft.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/pc12_pilatus_factsheet.ctt/pc12_pilatus_factsheet.pdf =Piper PA-42 Cheyenne IIIA= Piper PA-42 Cheyenne IIIA. The Cheyenne III Interceptor is a high endurance, all-weather, tactical turbo-prop aircraft, designed for CBP's Air and Marine Operations specifically for long-range missions. The Piper PA-42 is equipped with fire-control radar from the USAF F-16 Falcon along with a FLIR system. These aircraft, which fly with a crew of three (pilot, copilot, and sensor operator), can operate from remote landing strips and are utilized to intercept and track airborne smugglers.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/fw_aircraft/pa42_cheyenne_factsheet.ctt/pa42_cheyenne_factsheet.pdf Rotary wingAgustaWestland AW-139= AgustaWestland AW-139. AW-139 helicopters are medium-range, all-weather, tactical apprehension aircraft used by CBP's Air and Marine Operations to protect the American public from threats of terrorism and drug smuggling, and to enforce airspace security over critical venues. AMO's AW-139s, which usually fly with a crew of three (pilot, copilot, and crewmember), are large, powerful helicopters, which can carry all the equipment and personnel necessary for law enforcement operations without sacrificing range and speed. In addition, they are well suited to the all- weather hazardous environments in which AMO routinely operates.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/rw_aircraft/aw139_factsheet.ctt/aw139_factsheet.pdf =American Eurocopter AS-350 A-Star= Eurocopter AS-350 A-Star. The AS-350 Light Enforcement Helicopter (LEH) is a short-range, turbine-powered helicopter used by CBP's Office of Air and Marine to perform aerial reconnaissance of stationary or moving targets. These LEHs are the optimal aerial surveillance platform in metropolitan areas because their vertical lift capability and maneuverability enable operations from off-airport sites and in close proximity to congested airports.

AMO is remanufacturing UH-1H utility helicopters to a Huey II configuration. The UH-1H helicopters are short-range, turbine powered helicopters, which fly with a crew of two (pilot and copilot). The medium-lift capability of the UH-1H supports agents in high- altitude and hot environments. The UH-1H helicopter is used by Air and Marine to perform tactical and utility missions along the border. The helicopter's secondary mission is to provide external lift capability in support of drug seizures and equipment delivery. The remanufacturing dramatically increases mission capability, including increases in hover performance, gross weight, payload, and speed. The conversion also enables Air and Marine to manage its component supply system more efficiently.http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/am/operations/oam_vessels/aircraft/rw_aircraft/uh_1h_bellhuey_factsheet.ctt/uh_1h_bellhuey_factsheet.pdf =McDonnell Douglas MD-500= MD-500 Light Enforcement Helicopters (LEH) are short- to medium-range, turbine-powered helicopters used by AMO primarily as a light observation helicopter for tracking and general support for ground units.

These vessel crews are trained in maritime detection, pursuit, and high-risk boardings. They often work with a limited number of personnel during conditions conducive to smuggling to detect and interdict vessels carrying goods and people illegally crossing the United States border. Marine Interdiction Agents are assisted by federal and state operated aircraft, and often utilize officers from other agencies who must be specially trained by AMO in maritime law enforcement tactics and safety.

The town of Comber is a short distance to the north-east, the town of Saintfield to the south, and the city of Belfast further to the north-west. It is within the civil parishes of Killinchy and Comber and the historic barony of Castlereagh Lower. It had a population of 2,957 people in the 2011 Census. Bus Services Ballygowan has a bus depot connecting Ballygowan to Belfast, Comber, Newtownards and Darragh Cross. Belfast Route (inc. Darragh Cross) - 12/512 Comber/Newtownards Route - 5b These routes are run by Translink Ulsterbus. The Belfast route uses improved Urby buses run along this route, which include leather seats, free WiFi and USB Charging Ports.  History  Before the early 17th century Plantation of Ulster, when a lot of people moved from the Scottish Lowlands to settle in the area on lands granted by King James I to James Hamilton and Hugh Montgomery, the area of Ballygowan was sparsely inhabited by Irish Gaels. It was within the territory of Clannaboy, and in 1744 the McGowans of the Ards were associated with the Clannaboy O'Neills. In the late 18th century the village comprised a bridge (over the River Blackwater at the intersection of the Comber/Saintfield and Killyleagh/Belfast roads), a dozen or so small houses and an inn. The surrounding townlands were populated by a great number of small tenant farmers and weavers. The main landlords were Lord Dufferin and Lord Londonderry. From the mid-19th century through the early 20th century the population of the rural area surrounding Ballygowan declined considerably as many people emigrated to North America or found work in Comber, Saintfield and particularly in Belfast. However, it was during this period, and subsequent to the introduction of the Belfast & County Down Railway in 1850, that the village began to grow. Ballygowan railway station opened on 10 September 1858, but finally closed on 16 January 1950. After the railway closed in 1950 the village became an attractive \\"dormitory\\" town and the ensuing 50 years have seen rapid growth.http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/public/AreaProfileReportViewer.aspx?FromAPAddressMulipleRecords=Ballygowan@Exact match of location name: @Exact Match Of Location Name: Ballygowan@4?

Biography Born at Newark, New Jersey, in 1834 Jacobus graduated from Princeton College and four years later from Princeton Seminary. He received the degree of D.D. from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College) (1852) and LL. D. from Princeton in 1867. In 1839, after a year of teaching Hebrew at Princeton Seminary, Jacobus accepted the pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York. After a serving nearly twelve years, his health failed, and he made a tour through Europe, Egypt, and the Holy Land. On his return to the United States, he became a professor of Oriental and biblical literature at Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and he held that chair from 1852 until his death in 1876. Between 1858 and 1870, in addition to his academic duties, he served as pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1869 Jacobus was the moderator of the last general assembly of the old school branch of the U.S. Presbyterians, and in 1870 presided, conjointly with Philemon H. Fowler, at the opening of the first assembly of the reunited church. Writing Jacobus' personal diary contains this sadly yet illuminating note: \\"Sept 19, 1876. This day‚Äîa brilliant sky and invigorating air‚ÄîI am sixty years old, writing these reminiscences of early life, thankful to a covenant God for His great goodness, wherewith He has distinguished my lot, and hopeful for other years of usefulness.\\" This was written a mere 5 weeks before his death. Jacobus would go on to produce several commentaries upon Scripture that found favor within many in the Reformed community. Charles Hodge, William Henry Green, J.W. Alexander and others from Princeton Seminary said, \\"The excellent Commentaries of Dr. Melancthon Jacobus have deservedly attained a high reputation, and their wide circulation proves how well they are adapted to the wants of both ministers and laymen. They present, in a brief compass, the results of extensive erudition, abound in judicious exposition and pertinent illustration, and are, moreover, distinguished by doctrinal soundness, evangelical character, and an eminently devout spirit.\\" Others have given equal praise to Jacobus' written works. C.H. Spurgeon stated his commentary on Genesis is \\"A very valuable work...It contains much Gospel teaching, and aids the preacher greatly. Not easily to be obtained. It ought to be reprinted.\\" William S. Plumer noted that Jacobus' commentaries were \\"characterized by solid learning, sound doctrine, and lucid statements, a pleasant style, and the most serious spirit of piety.\\" Regarding his work on Acts, Dr. Robert P. Martin showered praise with this comment: \\"Jacobus writes in the popular style of Albert Barnes, and is solidly Reformed. Some commentators make you plow an acre to find a single nugget; but not Jacobus. His exegetical notes are concise but meaty, with rich veins of practical exposition.\\" Publications *Notes on the New Testament (four volumes, 1848-1859) *Address to the Churches (1861) *Note: Critical and Explanatory on Genesis (two volumes, 1864-1865) *Exodus (1876) *Notes: Critical and Explanatory on the Acts of the Apostles (1859) *Letters on the Public School Question Family His son Melancthon Williams Jacobus Jr. was a clergyman and educator.

Biography A native of Monroe, Michigan, Ingersoll studied for a time at Oberlin College and afterward at Harvard University, where he was a pupil of Louis Agassiz. Agassiz died in 1873, and Ingersoll made his journalistic debut with an article for the New York Tribune in January 1874 on Agassiz' work, for which he received $40 and the request for more scientific articles. In 1874, he went West as zoologist in the Hayden survey of 1874. In 1875, Ingersoll published a scientific paper describing what he had collected, mostly mollusks. On the expedition he made friends with photographer William Henry Jackson. They were the first scientists to investigate and describe the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings. Ingersoll sent dispatches to the Tribune, and the result was an offer to join its staff that year, which he accepted. While working as a reporter, he also wrote articles for an antecedent of Field and Stream and other magazines. In 1877, he made a second trip West, again writing articles for periodicals on his experiences. 1879 found him visiting Colorado and writing on mining operations. That year he also began his work describing shellfisheries for a joint project of the United States Fish Commission and the United States Census Bureau. That project lasted until 1881. His reports treated modern fisheries, and also discussed shellfish utilization much earlier by Native Americans and early societies worldwide. Ingersoll was an early advocate of protection of wildlife and natural habitats, and preferred field notes and photographs to taking specimens. These views he presented in popular lectures around 1888. From the 1890s to 1905, he updated guide books for Rand McNally. He took up residence in New York City in 1900. At that time he was writing a weekly column for a Montreal paper. Letters he received from readers indicated a need for material on bird identification, and he did a series of articles presenting a list of Canadian birds with descriptions. He did a similar list for Canadian snakes, which his daughter Helen helped write and illustrate. Helen also helped illustrate some of his books. He stopped writing the column in 1938, when he retired. Ernest Ingersoll was 94 years old when he died in a Brattleboro, Vermont, nursing home after a four-year illness. Family He married Mary Schofield (1853-1920) in 1873. They had two children: Helen (b. 1874), and Geoffrey (b. 1889).

The 76th Radio Technical Brigade is stationed there. History The original inhabitants apparently were various Tungusic peoples. Formerly part of Outer Manchuria, Vyatskoye along with Khabarovsk and Vladivostok was ceded to Imperial Russia by the Qing dynasty as part of the 1860 Convention of Peking. During World War II near Vyatskoye was a camp for the Soviet 88th Brigade, which was made up of Korean and Chinese guerrillas. Kim Il-sung, future leader of North Korea, was stationed there as a Captain in the Soviet Red Army commanding a battalion, and according to some sources his family was there as well. According to those same sources his son Kim Jong-il was born there on February 16, 1941 (although the North Korean government claims Kim Jong-il was born on Paektu Mountain in Japanese Korea a year later, on February 16, 1942). Residents of the town claim that his brother Shura Kim (sometimes known as the first Kim Pyong-il) fell into a well and died, and was buried there; however other sources claim that Kim Jong-il's sibling drowned in a pool in Pyongyang in 1947.

On April 17, 1869, he was transferred to the 2d Infantry; on January 1, 1871, to the 1st artillery. He was Commandant of Cadets and Professor of Military Science and Tactics and Mathematics at West Virginia University 1877-78. He was a very popular professor. He was promoted captain of artillery on July 1, 1880; major on June 1, 1897, and lieutenant-colonel on October 5, 1900. He served in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and other points in the south between 1864 and 1871, and was then sent to the artillery school at Fort Monroe, graduating in the class of 1872. He was then stationed successively at Plattsburgh Barracks, and Forts Jefferson and Barrancas, and, in July 1880, was assigned to the command of Battery A, Governor's Island, New York Harbor, and thence transferred to San Francisco Harbor, where he served until ordered to Battery G at Fort Munroe 1882. He suggested and organized the department of ballistics at the artillery school, Fort Monroe, and was made the first instructor on December 19, 1882, which position he held until the school suspended operations in spring 1898 because of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He was also senior instructor in practical artillery exercises, class of 1884; in engineering, class of 1888; in electricity and defensive torpedoes, classes of 1884, 1886, 1888 and 1890; and in signaling, 1884-88. Lieutenant Colonel Ingalls retired from the Army in 1901. In 1904, he was made colonel retired. Ingalls died on May 1, 1927 in Providence, Rhode Island, and is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery, New London, Connecticut. Author A. J. Bastarache has called Colonel Ingalls the \\"Father of Ballistics\\" for his pioneering research that contributed to America's military successes through the 20th century. Family life Ingalls married Elizabeth Niles, daughter of John S. Niles and Elizabeth Lilly, in July 1860, in Dane County, Wisconsin. She was born in 1841 in Leon, Cattaraugus County, New York, and died on July 28, 1875 of typhoid fever at Fort Barrancas, Escambia County, Florida, and is buried in the national cemetery there. They had two children. Their son, Arthur Niles Ingalls (1861‚Äì1875), also died of typhoid fever and is buried with his mother. Their daughter, Hilda Eliza Ingalls (born September 1868 in McPhersonburg, Virginia) married Joel Randall Burrow in 1889. He later became the Secretary of State of the State of Kansas. Hilda died on November 4, 1908, and is buried at Fairview Cemetery, Smith Center, Kansas. Ingalls married a second time on July 17, 1877, in New London, Connecticut, to Harriet Elizabeth Thurston, daughter of Benjamin Babcock Thurston, who had been Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island. They had one child, Fanny Thurston Ingalls, who never married.

Serving as the chief of the bureau of entomology, a successor to C.V. Riley, he helped establish economic entomology as a profession in the United States and strengthened research activities, helping establish laws to prevent the introduction of agricultural pests. He was a specialist on the Hymenopteran family Chalcididae, which are parasitic and contributed to the introduction of biological control agents for pest management. Howard also took an interest in medical entomology. Early life Howard was born to Ossian Gregory Howard, a lawyer, and Lucy Denham Thurber on 11 June 1857. His relatives from his mother's side included the Harvard astronomer E.C. Pickering while other distant relatives included Senator J.M. Howard and President William Howard Taft. Shortly after his birth, the family moved from Rockford, to Ithaca, New York where his father worked with a law firm. Howard attended Ithaca Academy. An interest in insect collecting encouraged by his parents with the gift of The Butterfly Hunters by Mary Treat at the age of 10 followed by more books and at the age of 13, along with another collector friend, recorded the introduction of the European cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) in the Catskill region. Along with his friends, he founded the Ithaca Natural History Society to meet and discuss papers and insects. While out collecting one day, he met John Henry Comstock, who invited him to his lab at Cornell University. Howard enrolled in Cornell in September 1873, three years after the death of his father, and following the advice of his mother's friends, went to study civil engineering. Doing poorly in differential calculus made him drop engineering and he began to study other subjects including French, German, and Italian. He then joined Comstock's lab as the first research student and graduated in June 1877 with a thesis on respiration in the larva of Corydalis cornutus. He worked with Burt Green Wilder and Simon Henry Gage and received a masters at Cornell. In the 1880s, he also attended Columbian College (now George Washington University) for medicine, although he didn't complete it. He however received an honorary MD from the same university in 1911 for his contribution to medical entomology. Career In July 1878, on the recommendation of Professor Comstock, he applied for a post in the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an assistant entomologist to C.V. Riley. The salary was low ($100/month) and despite advice against joining it from many friends and family, he took up the job. Among his first tasks was to prepare a manual on sericulture which was published with Riley as the author. Riley was replaced by Professor Comstock and again many of his writings went under the authorship of Comstock. This was accepted practice and Howard changed this practice when he rose in authority and ensured that all his co-workers were appropriately credited, and he eventually became chief of the Bureau of Entomology in 1894. He held the position until 1 October 1927. He continued to consult the Bureau until officially retiring on 30 June 1931. He worked on the systematics of the parasitic Hymenoptera, biological control, and medical entomology of mosquitoes and flies. He was the editor of Insect Life, lecturer on entomology at several colleges and universities, and a contributor to reference books on the subject of entomology. He was made permanent secretary of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, honorary curator in the United States National Museum, and consulting entomologist of the Public Health Service. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 and since 1907 was a Fellow of the Entomological Society of America.  Personal life  Howard married Marie T. Clifton in 1886, \\"a girl with a glorious soprano voice\\", who he met while singing in a choir at college. They had three daughters. Howard was known for his interests in sports.

Composition It was initially constituted with four members, Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia. A further four were added to the cartel in 1975 - Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Yugoslavia. CIPEC represented around 30% of the world's refined copper, and more than 50% of the proven reserves of copper. The intent of the members to secure higher prices failed, particularly of increasing the price during the crisis of 1975-1976, and the subsequent change of behavior of Chile finally finished the cartel. Many experts consider that the market power of this cartel was negligible, because the residual demand that it faced was elastic (much higher than OPEC, for example). The inability of coordinating output cutbacks during the extensive period of life of CIPEC seems to validate this hypothesis. It was dissolved during the 1990s.  CIPEC stages  There were three stages of the CIPEC that economists recognize: * Nationalization stage (1967‚Äì1973) * Unilateral Action stage (1973‚Äì1976) * Reflux stage (1976‚Äì1988)  Environmental conditions for CIPEC  The OPEC embargo marked a turning point in the history of the international copper trade, waking up the countries that depended strongly on their exports of commodities. They desired to imitate the behavior of CIPEC with the objective of increasing the prices of their commodities. Motivated by Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ), in November 1974 in Lusaka the members of CIPEC reached an agreement to reduce copper exports by 10% -- later increased to 15% -- until the first half of 1976. The high incentives meant that the countries did not fully complete the agreement and in fact in this period only 300,000 tons of copper were reduced by the cartel ‚Äî hardly half of the reductions contemplated in the agreement. High inventories and the growth of sources outside of the cartel prevented the policies adopted by CIPEC from giving benefit to its members.

The park is northwest of the Village of Oriskany on NY Route 69 and is southeast of the City of Rome. An obelisk, with plaques at the base commemorating the battle and its participants, is the central feature of the site. The battlefield is on the south side of the Mohawk River. The terrain consists of small rises, divided by ravines, above Mohawk River bottomlands. Battle Patriot militia General Nicholas Herkimer, leading a relief column to the besieged Fort Stanwix, was ambushed in a ravine by Iroquois chief Joseph Brant, leading a mixed group of Iroquois and Tories. Herkimer had his ambushed militia fight in pairs behind cover. One militiaman fired, while he was reloading the other militiaman covered him. This tactic was effective due to the Iroquois warriors tactics of charging the enemy after they fired. After sustaining high casualties in the number of native War Chiefs, and a heavy downpour the British forces withdrew, leaving the Tryon County militia in possession of the field. The occupants at the fort used the reduction in the force before them as an opportunity to sally out and sack the British camp. Herkimer died of his wounds days later. Oriskany is known as the bloodiest battle of the American Revolution. In respects to the number of combatants, casualties sustained and the fact that many of the combatants had friends and relatives on the opposing side. See Battle of Oriskany for more details. Commemoration A monument at the site stands above a small rise that many of the ambushed Americans found their way to, and where Herkimer, wounded, rallied and directed the American forces. Plaques on the monument depict Herkimer and list many of the American participants in the battle. The monument was dedicated in 1884. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962. and It is a New York State Historic Site.

History Electric Football's ancestry can be traced back to 1929, when Elmer Sas incorporated Tudor Metal Products in New York City. The company survived the Depression and in the late 1940s, Elmer's son Norman became president of Tudor and invented the game, Electric Football. Norman Sas based the game on a vibrating car race game that Tudor already made. The early #500 Electric Football models were crude to the modern eye, but were the first tabletop football game which featured actual moving players as they reacted to the vibrations created by the electro-magnet motor under the metal field. Actual passing and kicking was also a unique feature of this first of its kind design. Electric Football was an immediate hit and became one of the hottest items at Christmas time through the 1960s and 1970s and to date has sold 70 million games. Tudor did so well with the game that other companies also entered the fray; Coleco, Munro and Gotham. Over the coming years, some of Electric Football's greatest innovations would come out of the competition between the companies. Tudor produced the first all-plastic 3D players and in the 1960s an industrial designer named Lee Payne was showing Norman Sas a new set of player prototypes whose additional realism would change Electric Football forever. Tudor introduced these players on its first large game, the #600 model. Besides figures in five different realistic poses, Payne sold them on the idea of painting the figures using actual NFL uniform colors. He was instrumental in working with the creative services department of the NFL to obtain the NFL license for marketing the NFL uniformed teams. By now Payne was working directly for Tudor Games as head of Product Development. He began taking the game boards to new heights with more realistic fields and lithographed, crowd scene backgrounds complete with scoreboards. Payne used a softer plastic material to develop the Triple Threat Quarterback (TTQB) that can run, pass, and kick. In 1967 Tudor introduced its new flagship Model 620, complete with an improved metal playing surface, cardboard backdrop scoreboard, NFL-style goal posts and NFL painted teams. This quickly set the standard for Electric Football, making the game even more popular, allowing Tudor Games to be the number one choice when selecting an Electric football game. Later, to make these realistic figures more enjoyable Tudor Games went on to create the ‚ÄúTTC‚Äù or Total Team Control base with its directional dial allowing finer route control and all new capabilities. In 1990 Tudor Games was sold to Miggle Toys and under the direction of Mike Landsman, the game was nurtured, preserved, and made popular again creating another generation of game hobbyists and enthusiasts. In February, 2012, Landsman handed off operations to new owner, Doug Strohm who renamed the company, Tudor Games. Strohm re-established the NFL license, created new innovations, figures and fields and added products from many of the hobbyist inventors across the country, making Tudor Games a one stop shop for the game. Tudor Games with the help of dedicated Electric Football enthusiasts and an Electric Football non- profit fan association called the Miniature Football Coaches Association, has re-energized the game for new generations of sports fans, game players, hobbyists, and collectors. The Electric Football hobby today features many local, regional, national and even international leagues and tournaments with hundreds of coaches participating and caps off with a World Championship tournament and convention. The game The Detroit Lions offense works deep from their end zone against the Nebraska Cornhuskers at the Electric Football World Championships. The game is played on a metal field, which can range in size between 24 inches long by 13 inches wide up to full scale size of 61 inches long by 27.5 inches wide. Detailed, plastic players on bases, which react to the vibration of the field, are placed on the field in formations, just as in real football. When the formations are completed by the offensive coach and the defensive coach, audibles in the form of pivots or motions are made in order to try to gain an advantage. A switch is activated that turns on an electric or battery powered counterbalanced motor which causes the field to vibrate and the players to move around the field. 304x304px As mentioned, each player is attached to a base, with \\"prongs\\" or \\"brushes\\", also known as \\"cleats\\", on the underneath of the base. These prongs can be \\"coached\\" prior to the playing of the game by using smooth mouthed pliers which stretch, shape and or flatten the prongs to get them to perform faster, stronger and in an exact route. The base in combination with a specific action figure can then be put in an on field position in the offense or defense that best makes use of the combined attributes. Special players are used to pass, kick or punt the ball. The ball is a small slit oval piece of felt, rubberized foam or leather. The throwing Quarterback has an extended arm which the ball is placed on. The arm or the entire man can be bent backwards in order to flick the football off the arm to the intended receiver. If the ball touches the receiver figure or its base, it is considered a complete catch. Use of the throwing Quarterback is a difficult skill to master and requires practice to develop. Special players are also used for kicking and punting and have spring legs which when pulled back and released, kick or punt the ball. The original iconic quarterback that comes with the game is capable of passing and kicking and is known as the Triple Threat QB or TTQ. In 2016, an app called Electric Football Challenge was created. The app serves as a digital scoreboard with configurable timers matching the flow of real football. The app can be enabled to do the passing and kicking in place of the traditional Triple Threat QB/Kicker. It also has a playbook containing over 45 plays and a rules section for the game. In popular culture * Steamroller Studios and Chillingo released their version of the classic game for the iPhone and iPod Touch in September 2009, called \\"Super Shock Football\\". In January 2010 they also released an \\"HD\\" version for the iPad. * In the film Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, the two main characters, in a parody of The Seventh Seal, challenge Death to a series of games in order to escape Hell. One of the games Death loses is electric football. * In an episode of the animated comedy series The Critic, a clip from a Ken Burns documentary about electric football shows an elderly man saying that \\"electric football is a metaphor for America: always shaking, always noisy, never really knowing where it's going\\" before suddenly changing his mind, saying, \\"Wait a minute. America's nothing like electric football. It's just a stupid game that doesn't even work!\\" and yelling at the cameraman to get out. * In The Simpsons episode \\"Bart Star\\", while coaching his son's peewee football team, Homer Simpson uses an electric football table, even instructing one player to \\"spin around in a circle\\".

He was the fifth and the youngest son of Ranoji Rao Scindia, the founder of the Scindia dynasty. The Maratha Resurrection in North India Mahadaji was instrumental in resurrecting Maratha power in North India after the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, and rose to become a trusted lieutenant of the Peshwa, leader of the Maratha Empire. Along with Madhavrao I and Nana Fadnavis, he was one of the three pillars of Maratha Resurrection. During his reign, Gwalior became the leading state in the Maratha Empire and one of the foremost military powers in India. After accompanying Shah Alam II in 1771 to Delhi, he restored the Mughals in Delhi and became the Vakil-ul-Mutlaq (Regent of the Empire).Vakil-ul-Mutlaq (Regent of the Empire) Mahadji Shinde's principal Advisors were all Shenvis. He annihilated the power of Jats of Mathura and during 1772-73 he destroyed the power of Pashtun Rohillas in Rohilkhand and captured Najibabad. His role during the First Anglo-Maratha War was greatest from the Maratha side since he humbled the British in the Battle of Wadgaon which resulted in the Treaty of Wadgaon and then again in Central India, single handed, which resulted in the Treaty of Salbai in 1782, where he mediated between the Peshwa and the British. In 1782‚Äì83, Mahadaji Shinde, victoriously brought back three silver gates taken from Somnath temple from Lahore after defeating Mahmud Shah Abdali, to Somnath. After refusal from priests of Gujarat and the then ruler Gaekwad to put them back on Somnath temple, these silver gates were placed in the temples of Ujjain. Today they can be seen in two temples of India. Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga and Gopal Mandir of Ujjain.In 1787 Mahadji attempted to invade Rajputana but he was repulsed by the Rajput armies at Lalsot. In 1790 he defeated the Rajput kingdoms of Jodhpur and Jaipur in the Battles of Patan and Merta. Treaty of Salbai After the British defeat, Hastings through Murre proposed a new treaty, known as the Treaty of Salbai, between the Peshwa and the British that would recognize Sawai Madhavrao as the Peshwa and grant Raghunath Rao a pension. The treaty also returned to Shinde all his territories west of the Yamuna and so was made to withdraw to Ujjain. A resident, Mr. David Anderson (1750-1825), of St. GermainsBurkes Landed Gentry: Anderson of Northfield (who had negotiated the treaty) was at the same time appointed to Mahadji's court. After the Treaty of Salbai in 1782, he invaded and overpowered the Rajput states, particularly Jodhpur and Jaipur through the Battle of Patan, the Battle of Merta. Mahadji also ruled the Punjab as it used to be a Mughal territory and Sikh sardars and other Rajas of the cis-Sutlej region paid tributes to him. Later years Mahadji became Naib Vakil-ul-Mutlaq (deputy regent of Mughal affairs), and the Mughals also gave him the title of Amir-ul- Umara (head of the amirs) in 1784. Another achievement of Mahadji was his victory over the Nizam of Hyderabad's army in a battle. The Nizam state ceased to be a factor in the north Indian politics after this battle and it generally confined itself in the Deccan afterwards. After the peace made with Tipu Sultan of Mysore in 1792, Mahadji exerted his influence to prevent the completion of a treaty between the British, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and the Peshwa, directed against Tipu. Death and legacy Shinde Chhatri, Wanawdi, Pune: A memorial dedicated to Mahadji Shinde After the Battle of Lakheri, Mahadji was now at the zenith of his power, when he died, at his camp at Wanavdi near Pune on 12 February 1794. He left no heir, and was succeeded by Daulat Rao Scindia. Keeney, the English biographer of Mahadaji Shinde, has described Mahadaji as the greatest man in South Asia in the 18th century.Page 156, The Great Maratha Mahadaji Scindia, By N. G. Rathod, Publisher: Sarup & Sons, 1994, , 9788185431529 Mahadaji Shinde's role was instrumental in establishing Maratha supremacy over North India. Shinde Chhatri, located in Wanawadi, in Pune is a memorial dedicated to Mahadji Shinde. It is a hall that marks the spot of Mahadji Shinde's cremation on 12 February 1794. The three storied memorial in Rajput architectural style, is one of the most significant landmarks in the city.

Early life Ervin Wilson was born in a remote area of northwest Chihuahua, Mexico, where he lived until the age of fifteen. His mother taught him to play the reed organ and to read musical notation. He began to compose at an early age, but immediately discovered that some of the sounds he was hearing mentally could not be reproduced by the conventional intervals of the organ. As a teenager he began to read books on Indian music, developing an interest in concepts of raga. While he was in the Air Force in Japan, a chance meeting with a total stranger introduced him to musical harmonics, which changed the course of his life and work. Influenced by the work of Joseph Yasser, Wilson began to think of the musical scale as a living process‚Äîlike a crystal or plant. He has been mentor to many composers and instrument builders. Works Despite his avoidance of academia, Wilson has been influential on those interested in microtonal music and just intonation, especially in the areas of scale, keyboard, and notation design. Among his developments are Moments of Symmetry, Combination Product Sets, Golden Horograms, scales based on recurrence relations (scales of \\"Mt. Meru\\"), and mapping scales to the generalized keyboard. He cites Augusto Novaro and Joseph Yasser as influences. Wilson built instruments and explored the resources of 31 and 41 equal divisions of the octave. He supported the work of Harry Partch, proposed the design and helped build the Quadrangularis Reversum, and provided diagrams for Partch's book Genesis of a Music.

Originally known as the Avalon Telephone Company, it served the Avalon Peninsula and later became the Newfoundland Telephone Company and served several additional regions: southwestern Newfoundland between Port-aux-Basques and Corner Brook; part of the Burin Peninsula; Windsor and Grand Falls; and most of Labrador. This was as a result of the acquisition of four smaller companies and their phone services from 1948 to 1962. In 1979 it acquired the Labrador Telephone Company serving Labrador City and, in late 1988, it acquired Terra Nova Tel from Canadian National Railways, adding other communities on the island including Gander. In 1985, NewTel Enterprises was formed as Newfoundland Telephone's parent company, allowing the group to diversify. NewTel Cellular (later NewTel Mobility) was formed as a sister company under the NewTel Enterprises umbrella offering mobile phone service. The fixed-line utility continued to operate under the Newfoundland Telephone name until 1996, when it became NewTel Communications.

Over his career, Yuri Romanenko spent a total of 430 days 20 hours 21 minutes 30 seconds in space and 18 hours in space walks. In 1987 he was a resident of the Mir space station, launching on Soyuz TM-2 and landing aboard Soyuz TM-3. He remained on Mir for 326 days that was the longest stay in space at that time. His son, Roman Romanenko is also a cosmonaut, and has become the third second-generation space traveler on Soyuz TMA-15 in May 2009. Early life Yuri Romanenko was born on August 1, 1944 in Koltubanovskiy village in Orenburg Oblast, Soviet Union. His father was a senior commander on military ships, and mother was a combat medic. His family later moved to Kaliningrad, where he graduated from a secondary school in 1961. His hobbies in school included building model aircraft and ships, boxing, shooting and underwater fishing. After school, he briefly worked as a locksmith and builder. In 1962 he enrolled at the Chernigov High Air Force School, Ukraine and graduated with honors in 1966. After graduation, he remained with the School, training the students and practicing as a candidate cosmonaut. He was cleared for space flights in 1970, among only 16 other cosmonauts. Space missions His first flight was on December 10, 1977 on Soyuz 26 to the space station Salyut 6. A two-men crew consisted of Romanenko as the flight commander and Georgi Grechko as engineer. They spent 96 days and 10 hours on the orbit, meeting Soyuz 27, Soyuz 28 and Progress 1. During the mission, Romanenko performed a one and a half hour long space walk. In his second mission on September 18, 1980, together with the first Cuban cosmonaut Arnaldo Tamayo M√©ndez, Romanenko flew Soyuz 38 to Salyut 6 and returned 7 days later. With this flight, M√©ndez was the first hispanophone and first person of African descent in space. The third and last flight of Romanenko was on Soyuz TM-2 with Aleksandr Laveykin on February 6, 1987 to the Mir station. During that mission, Romanenko spent 326 days aboard Mir, which was the longest stay in space then. He conducted three space walks, on April 11, June 11 and June 16, 1987 with a total duration 8 hr 48 min. He returned to Earth on December 29, 1987 in Soyuz TM-3. Romanenko retired from flights in 1988 and became the director of Buran program, which was a Soviet alternative to the Space Shuttle. The program completed one flight in 1988 and was cancelled in 1993. Accidents While working in Salyut 6 station in 1977, Grechko and Romanenko had to perform spacewalks at will to inspect the potential damage at the station, which precluded docking of Soyuz 25. At some point, they were both in their spacewalk suits in the airlock. Romanenko prepared for a spacewalk and pushed against the wall flying outside, but forgot to attach his safety cord. Grechko managed to grab the cord with one hand, stopping Romanenko. This accident was dramatized in press due to the joke of Grechko who implied Romanenko was on the verge of death. However, the electrical cables attaching Romanenko would have certainly stopped him from leaving the space station. Awards During his career he was awarded: * Twice Hero of the Soviet Union (March 16, 1978 and September 26, 1980); * Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR; * Three Orders of Lenin (1978, 1980 and 1987)); * Order of the Red Star (1976); * Medal \\"For Merit in Space Exploration\\" (Russian Federation); * Hero of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1978); * Hero of the Republic of Cuba (1980); * Order \\"Madara Horseman\\" (Bulgarian Socialist Republic); * Order of Klement Gottwald (Czechoslovak Socialist Republic); * Medal \\"For Strengthening Military Cooperation\\" (Czechoslovak Socialist Republic). Military ranks and skills Romanenko is a professional pilot. He flew Yak-18, L-29, Mig-15, Mig-17 and Mig-21, and had 39 parachute jumps. His military progression was: * Lieutenant (October 27, 1966) * Captain (February 3, 1971) * Major (February 21, 1974) * Lieutenant Colonel (December 14, 1976) * Colonel (March 17, 1978) * Discharged from military service on October 2, 1995 because of reaching the age limit. Personal life Romanenko has a half-brother, Vladimir (born in 1940), and a sister, Olga (born in 1954). He is married and has two sons, Roman (born on August 9, 1971) and Artem (born May 17, 1977). Roman is a cosmonaut who flew as the commander of Soyuz TMA-15 mission. Through most of his life, Yuri Romanenko was keen to underwater fishing and other aquatic activities. In space, he started composing and singing his own songs. After the Romanenko- M√©ndez flight and retirement of Romanenko in 1988, he and his family were invited to Cuba, where he was personally met by Fidel Castro. Knowing that Romanenko was partial to hunting and underwater fishing, Castro had organized a social tour and participated in the fishing, freediving with Romanenko to a 10-meter depth.

Biography Educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, his academic career began in 1955 when he was appointed Assistant Lecturer in English Literature at the University of North Wales, Bangor. From there, he went to the University of East Anglia where he was later appointed Reader. He took early retirement in the 1980s. Dyson single-handedly took the initiative in forming the Homosexual Law Reform Society (HLRS) in May 1958. He had sent hundreds of letters to Members of Parliament and celebrities asking for their support, successfully bringing together an impressive collection of distinguished names, including Noel Annan, Lord Attlee, A. J. Ayer, Isaiah Berlin, Trevor Huddleston, Julian Huxley, C. Day-Lewis, J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell, Donald Soper, A.J.P Taylor, Angus Wilson and Barbara Wootton. The campaign began with a letter, signed by all these figures, published in The Times on 7 March 1958, calling for the implementation of the Wolfenden Committee's recommendations that the law in relation to male homosexual relations be liberalised.Antony Grey, Quest for Justice: Towards homosexual emancipation, London, 1992, pp.26 ff. Dyson had written on the University of North Wales headed paper making a bold statement of exactly who and where he was, which was a risky move. Shopland, Norena 'I was concerned with liberty‚Äô from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales, Seren Books, 2017 ‚ÄúIt is difficult to comprehend the danger of living as a homosexual before the law was reformed in 1967, with the ever-present threat of criminal proceeding or blackmail. Dyson‚Äôs careful and courageous handing of the campaign during these years was instrumental in ensuring that it did not arouse animosity and become counter-productive.‚Äù 'A. E. Dyson', The Times, 13 August 2002. The same group of people simultaneously founded the Albany Trust, the charitable arm of the HLRS, which became the pioneer national counselling agency for gay men and lesbians. Dyson was Vice-Chairman of the HLRS and a Trustee of the Albany Trust.Grey, p.30. During this time he met Cliff Tucker (December 18, 1912 - May 21, 1993), a senior executive at British Petroleum, a Labour Party councillor in inner London and a magistrate. They lived together for 35 years until Tucker's death in 1993.C.B. Cox, \\"A.E. Dyson: Literary critic, Black Paper editor and campaigner for homosexual law reform\\" (obituary), The Independent, London, 1 August 2002. Dyson followed Tucker's final wishes and bequeathed the proceeds of their Hampstead home to Tucker's alma mater, the University of Wales, Lampeter. As a result, there is now a scholarship and lecture theatre which bear Tucker's name, and a Fellowship in Poetry named for Dyson. In 1959 Dyson, together with Brian Cox, founded the literary journal Critical Quarterly, described in New Pelican Guide to English Literature as \\"probably the most influential English literary-critical journal in the academic field over the post-war decades\\". Together they wrote Modern Poetry: Studies in Practical Criticism (1963) which became a standard text book for many years. As a literary critic, Dyson has published works on Shakespeare, Dickens, Samuel Coleridge Taylor and Sylvia Plath, among others. In 1969 Dyson and Cox published the first of what became a series of five Black Papers\\"The Black Papers ‚Äî there were five but the first two had the greatest impact...\\" attacking \\"progressive\\" educational methods and the Labour government's policy of replacing grammar schools with comprehensive schools. This and subsequent Black Papers attracted considerable support, especially on the right of the political spectrum. However, they failed to stop the comprehensive schools movement. Tony Dyson died in London in July 2002 after suffering from leukemia for several years. The Papers of Tony Dyson and of his partner, Cliff Tucker, are housed at the University of Manchester John Rylands Library Special Collections. A further box of his papers is held at LSE Archives.

When reissued in mid-1979, following the success of the follow-up Replicas (1979), the more commonly known cover art featuring a stylised portrait of Gary Numan was introduced.Steve Malins (1998). Tubeway Army 1998 reissued CD liner notes This release made No. 14 in the UK album charts.Everyhit.com Overview Despite being the band's debut, Tubeway Army was seen as a transitional record, linking the punk flavour of early singles \\"That's Too Bad\\" and \\"Bombers\\" with the electronic music and science fiction imagery of Replicas. The first track, \\"Listen to the Sirens\\", borrowed its opening line from the Philip K. Dick novel Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said, while \\"Steel and You\\" contained references to androids (\\"Just my steel friend and me / I stand brave by his side\\"). These and a number of other tracks featured primitive synthesizer effects, the legacy of Numan chancing upon a Minimoog in the recording studio one day. Elsewhere, the album‚Äôs lyrics generally inhabited a seedy world that was compared to William Burroughs, an author whose influence Numan acknowledged. \\"Friends\\" concerned male prostitution. \\"Every Day I Die\\" was about teenage masturbation. \\"Jo the Waiter\\" referenced drug addiction. \\"The Life Machine\\" was told from the perspective of a comatose man on life support who can only \\"watch from somewhere as the loved ones come and go\\". Sonically, the album ranged from hard rock with punk overtones, such as \\"My Shadow in Vain\\", \\"Friends\\" and \\"Are You Real?\\", through the post-punk of \\"Listen to the Sirens\\" and \\"The Dream Police\\", to the predominantly acoustic \\"Every Day I Die\\" and \\"Jo the Waiter\\". Major influences cited for this album's overall sound included David Bowie (both 'Ziggy' and 'Berlin' eras), early Roxy Music and Brian Eno, Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground, and early Ultravox. Numan has regularly performed tracks from this album since his early solo career, including \\"My Shadow in Vain\\", \\"Something's in the House\\", \\"Every Day I Die\\" and \\"The Dream Police\\". Others that later appeared in his live repertoire included \\"Listen to the Sirens\\", \\"Friends\\" and \\"Jo the Waiter\\".

Instead of the pole formerly employed to mark a point, a staff similar to a level staff is used. This is marked with heights from the base or foot, and is graduated according to the form of tacheometer in use. The horizontal distance is inferred from the vertical angle included between two well-defined points on the staff and the known vertical distance between them. Alternatively, also by readings of the staff indicated by two fixed stadia wires in the diaphragm (reticle) of the telescope. The difference of height is computed from the angle of depression or elevation of a fixed point on the staff and the horizontal distance already obtained. The azimuth angle is determined as formerly. Thus all the measurements requisite to locate a point both vertically and horizontally with reference to the point where the tacheometer is centred are determined by an observer at the instrument without any assistance beyond that of a man to hold the staff. The ordinary methods of surveying with a theodolite, chain, and levelling instrument are fairly satisfactory when the ground is relatively clear of obstructions and not very precipitous, but it becomes extremely cumbersome when the ground is covered with bush, or broken up by ravines. Chain measurements then become slow and liable to considerable error; the levelling, too, is carried on at great disadvantage in point of speed, though without serious loss of accuracy. These difficulties led to the introduction of tacheometry. In western countries, tacheometry is primarily of historical interest in surveying, as professional measurement nowadays is usually carried out using total stations and recorded using data collectors. Location positions are also determined using GNSS. Traditional methods and instruments are still in use in many areas of the world and by users who are not primarily surveyors. Tacheometer A tachymeter or tacheometer is a type of theodolite used for rapid measurements and determines, electronically or electro- optically, the distance to target. The principles of action are similar to those of rangefinders. Stadia measurements Other forms of tacheometry in surveying include the use of stadia rods with theodolites or plane-table alidades.Raymond Davis, Francis Foote, Joe Kelly, Surveying, Theory and Practice, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1966 LC 64-66263 These use stadia marks on the instrument's reticle to measure the distance between two points on the stadia rod (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to the stadia rod by multiplying the stadia interval by the stadia interval factor. If the stadia rod is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and the rod. The formula most widely used for finding the distances is: d = ks + c Here, s is the stadia interval (top intercept minus bottom intercept); k and c are multiplicative and additive constants. Generally, the instrument is made so that k = 100 and c = 0 exactly, to simplify calculations. Subtense bars Wild brand subtense bar Another device used in tacheometry is the subtense bar. This is a rigid rod, usually of a material insensitive to change in temperature such as invar, of fixed length (typically two metres). The subtense bar is mounted on a tripod over the station to which the distance is desired. It is brought to level and a small telescope on the bar enables the bar to be oriented perpendicular to the line of sight to the angle measuring station. A theodolite is used to measure the angle between indicators on the two ends of the subtense bar. The distance from the telescope to the subtense bar is the height of an isosceles triangle formed with the theodolite at the upper vertex and the subtense bar length at its base, determined by trigonometry.

The II Marine Expeditionary Force is commanded by a Lieutenant General, who serves under U.S. Marine Corps Forces Command, providing Marine fighting formations and units to European Command, Central Command and Southern Command. The current Commanding General is Lieutenant General Brian Beaudreault. The Deputy Commanding General is Brigadier General David Odom. Higher headquarters II MEF falls under the command of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Command (MARFORCOM), and is a service retained force, meaning it is not assigned or allocated to any of the Geographic Combatant Commands. However, II MEF regularly provides subordinate units in support of operations and exercises throughout the U.S. European Command, U.S. Africa Command, and U.S. Southern Command Areas of Responsibility, as well as in support of other U.S. unified and NATO commands. II MEF units are available for and prepared to respond to contingency requirements worldwide. Employment In addition to the option of being employed in its entirety as a MEF-sized unit, II MEF has the capability of forming task-organized Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF) of lesser size such as a MEF (Forward), a brigade-sized MAGTF (Marine Expeditionary Brigade or \\"MEB\\") about one-third the size of a MEF or a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), about one-third the size of a MEB. The size and composition of any MAGTF will be dependent upon the mission assigned. One mission that could be assigned to the MEB would be assignment for planning, deployment and utilization of equipment stored aboard Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS). The MPS program involves the forward deployment of the MPS Squadron of four or five ships loaded with a brigade's worth of combat equipment and supplies and the airlifting of the MEB to the designated objective area to link up with the MPS Squadron. At the same time, tactical aircraft of the MEB are flight ferried to an airfield in or near the area of operation. The MEB can be sustained for 30 days by the supplies aboard the ships. The only routinely deployed MAGTFs, the 22d, 24th and 26th MEUs deploy on a rotating basis to the Mediterranean Sea area to serve as the landing force for the Commander, 6th Fleet. The MEU consists of approximately 2,200 Marines and Sailors, is capable of rapid response in a variety of possible contingencies, and if the situation requires, can serve as the forward element of a larger MAGTF.

The album was released in early 1963 and became a huge hit, helping to propel the surf genre. It was sought by collectors for many years and gained great notoriety in the obscure surf market. In 1994, Sundazed records, a company with a lot of vintage surf at its disposal, released the album on CD with two bonus tracks. The tracks are all old numbers that serve as the foundation for surf rock. Songs by The Fireballs and Duane Eddy are on the album. The Beach Boys' debut Surfin' Safari and Surfer's Choice, the debut from Dick Dale & His Del-Tones had been released just a few months before Surfbeat was recorded. Tracks from both are on this album. Two tracks on the album, \\"Vampire\\" and \\"Kami-Kaze\\" are actually recordings by The Bel-Airs, the band that the Challengers formed out of. The guitarists and saxophonist are the only differences in line-up. The two songs were written cowritten by Bel- Airs guitarist Paul Johnson,Paul Johnson's Guitar Heaven (official site) who remained close to the band, later playing with them on other projects.

History  Opened in 1975 and closed in 2002 due to competition from the newly opened Streets at Southpoint mall, its original anchors were Belk-Leggett (later renamed Hudson-Belk), J.C. Penney, and Montgomery Ward. Other stores located there included Piccadilly Cafeterias, Miller & Rhoads, Montaldo's (a high-end women's fashion boutique), a Big Star Supermarket, Central Carolina Bank and Trust (now SunTrust), and a four-screen movie theater. In addition, South Square had a food court located off to the side on the second level, making it the first mall in the Triangle area with one (Crabtree Valley Mall, despite opening in 1972, did not get a food court until 1984). During the mid-1980s, a number of significant changes took place. Montgomery Ward vacated its space in 1985 as part of a corporate restructuring move made by the company. That space would eventually be filled by Ivey's (later Dillard's) a year later. It was during this time that the mall received its only interior upgrade. Big Star closed its store in 1988 after being bought out by Harris Teeter, only to have the space filled by an Office Depot. Montaldo's vacated the mall in the late 1980s to a new location down the road in Chapel Hill. The movie theater closed in 1994 when a new cineplex operated by Carmike Cinemas opened less than a mile away.  Life after the mall  After Belk and J.C. Penney relocated to Southpoint, Dillard's tried to hang in as the lone anchor, even though the mall itself was dying from the massive defections brought on by Southpoint's arrival. The mall closed in September 2002 after Dillard's shut down, only six months after Southpoint opened. The mall was eventually razed in 2004 to make way for a big box retail hub that includes a SuperTarget, Sam's Club, Ross Dress for Less, and Petco. The lone remnants of the mall's former life an Office Depot and Firestone have since remained open and have been integrated into the newly built development, which retains the \\"South Square\\" name. Other tenants on site include Carolina Ale House and Discount Tire Company. A planned Applebee's restaurant for the site has been on hold after the one located across the street closed in 2006 due to under-performing sales at that location.

Marcus Atilius Regulus (probably lived between 307 BC ‚Äì 250 BC) was a Roman statesman and general who was a consul of the Roman Republic in 267 BC and 256 BC. Life Regulus first became consul in 267 BC, when he fought the Messapians. Elected as a consul again in 256 BC, he served as a general in the First Punic War (256 BC), where he defeated the Carthaginians in a naval battle at Cape Ecnomus near Sicily and invaded North Africa, winning victories at Aspis and Adys, until he was defeated and captured at Tunis in 255 BC. After he was released on parole to negotiate a peace, he is supposed to have urged the Roman Senate to refuse the proposals and then, over the protests of his own people, to have fulfilled the terms of his parole rather than break his word by returning to Carthage, where, according to Roman tradition and Livy, he was tortured to death. In Tertullian's \\"To the Martyrs\\" (Chapter 4) and Augustine of Hippo's The City of God (I.15), it is said the Carthaginians \\"packed him into a tight wooden box, spiked with sharp nails on all sides so that he could not lean in any direction without being pierced.\\"Translation by Gerald G.

He was posthumously seen by the Romans as a model of civic virtue. Family Atilius Regulus, the son of the eponymous consul of 294 BC, descended from an ancient Calabrian family. According to later Roman historians, he married one Marcia, who tortured several Carthaginian prisoners to death on hearing of her husband's death.

The object of the game is to cool down the reactor core without being hurled by magnetism and repulsion by enemy swarms of nuclear particles. The game was ported to the Atari 2600 by Charlie Heath and published by Parker Brothers the same year. Reactor was developed by Tim Skelly, who previously designed and programmed a series of vector graphics arcade games for Cinematronics, including Rip-Off. It was the first arcade game to credit the developer on the game's title screen. Gameplay The player controls a cursor that can move freely within a screen-sized arena, the nuclear reactor. The center contains a sun-type gravitational power source, the slowly overheating reactor core. The surrounding wall or the sun, if touched results in death. The cursor is controlled with a trackball by the player, who has to roll it fast in one direction in order to overcome the momentum of gravitation imposed by the sun. Swarms of enemy objects named after various radioactive particles float around in the reactor arena, obeying simple physical laws. These enemies can freely bounce into the walls at low speeds, have a repulsive force against each other and actively attack the player cursor. Boss types often break up into several smaller particles. The object is to survive the sun and walls while gaining the highest score possible. It takes a delicate touch. Rather than moving the cursor/avatar left, right, up and down as in many arcade games, it is controlled by gravity and moves freely; with the player only being able to accelerate it rather than control its movements directly. Meanwhile the enemy particles are getting so aggressive that it can get very difficult to avoid being pulled in by the sun or touching a wall. The basic gameplay consists of accelerating the cursor just at the right times so that it circles the reactor core with enough speed to have control via its own momentum when the enemy particles try to knock it off course, and then to place decoys and actually use the acceleration of the ball itself to knock enemies into control rods, traps or the reactor core. By pressing the primary button the player cursor can go into high power mode, providing higher repulsion of enemies and conversely higher risk to the player. To ease the task the player also has a certain number of decoys at their disposal. Pressing the secondary button places a decoy to attract the enemies, luring them into two traps in the corners of the screen for bonus points, into destroying reactor rods or directly into the walls to kill them. Destroying a row of reactor rods gives the player one more decoy, as well as resetting the size of the slowly swelling reactor core. A time limit is enforced by the slowly swelling reactor core, which limits the space to move about in the arena. Although the reactor doesn't actually melt down, the decreasing space provides for gradually increasing difficulty. After defeating the first wave of enemies, the solid reactor core changes into Vortex core, unlike the Protect core, is lethal to touch (thus making such levels significantly harder). Ports The Atari 2600 version plays somewhat differently because the energy shield is always up. It can be played with either a joystick or a trackball, though the latter is not mentioned in the manual. The difficulty switches set the sensitivity of the controls. There are no voice overs, and the bonus counter is invisible. Additionally, the bonus counter can only hold so many points, after which points are added directly to the player's score. While an Intellivision version was licensed and developed, it was never released. Reception Tilt gave the game 93%, and said \\"A classic Gottlieb game that relies on physics for its gameplay, which is quite rewarding.\\"http://www.abandonware- magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=28#=285 A 1983 reviewer for Hi-Res magazine wrote, \\"VCS Reactor's main flaw is not in the game itself, but the flexibility of the controlling joystick. The trackball controller of the Gottlieb version is gone, replaced by the lackluster Atari joystick. The stiffness of the joystick makes it difficult to direct your ship with any great degree of precision.\\" References External links  * *Twin Galaxies High Score Rankings for Reactor Category:1982 video games Category:Action video games Category:Arcade games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Gottlieb video games Category:Parker Brothers video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Reactor (video game)"},{"id":"3544534","text":"Jack Arute at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May 2009.

In 1999, he covered the IRL for Fox Sports Net and Speedvision. In some instances, namely in 2004, Arute served as a booth announcer. During the same time period at ESPN and ABC, during the off-season of auto racing, Arute served as a sideline reporter for college football and during at least one NFL playoff game. In 2009, Arute joined the Versus on-air crew for the 2009 IndyCar season, serving on both the Versus and ABC telecasts. In August 2009, Indianapolis Star reporter Curt Cavin said that Arute will be leaving ESPN at the end of 2009 in favor of Versus full-time. He was fired from Versus due to cost-cutting moves after the merger with NBCUniversal. He was replaced by Kevin Lee, who is also a pit reporter for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Network. Currently, Arute does radio work with SiriusXM's Channel 90 with Trading Paint with Chocolate Myers on Thursdays and Fridays. Arute lives in Hampden, Massachusetts.

The railway never reached St. Louis but its North Star Limited passenger train ran to that city via the Wabash Railroad. The railway's most important route was between Minneapolis and Peoria, Illinois; a second major route extended from Minneapolis into eastern South Dakota, and other trackage served areas in north-central Iowa and south-central Minnesota. The M&StL; was founded in 1870, and expanded through line construction and acquisition until the early 20th century. Most of the railway's routes saw only relatively light traffic, and consequently the company's financial position was frequently precarious; the railroad operated under bankruptcy protection between 1923 and 1943. The M&StL; was acquired by the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1960, and much of its former trackage was abandoned. In 1956 it reported 1550 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 2 million passenger-miles on 1397 route-miles and 1748 track-miles operated; those totals do not include the 117-mile Minnesota Western. History=Beginning The Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway was created on May 26, 1870 by a group of Minnesota investors interested in establishing a railroad connection between Minneapolis and the agricultural regions to the south. Minneapolis was home to the largest flour milling operations in the country at that time. Wheat was the primary commodity grown in southern Minnesota and Northern Iowa. Not wanting to be captive shippers for railroad companies from Milwaukee and Chicago, the Washburns, Crosbys and Pillsburys ‚Äì the men who owned the flour mills in Minneapolis ‚Äì formed their own railroad as a way to ship wheat in and ship flour out. By 1880, the road had reached Albert Lea to the south and leased the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad to ship flour to Duluth, Minnesota for transport to markets served by Great Lakes shipping and to ship lumber south from Northern Minnesota and Northern Wisconsin using the St Paul and Taylor's Falls road as a means to capture a large portion of the lumber market. As the wheat growing regions moved north and west, the company acquired and built lines to South Dakota. 19th century Ultimately the railroad's primary line was extended south from the Twin Cities into Iowa and then east to Peoria. It ran through Mason City, Iowa, which became an important traffic center for the railroad. One of the major attractions of the railroad was that it allowed freight bound for Illinois to bypass Chicago. The Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway had spurs into various parts of Iowa and a line into South Dakota. During the 1880s the M&StL; went into its first receivership leaving the Rock Island interests in control of the M&StL.; The Rock Island turned over the operation of the western district of the Wisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific (another Rock Island road) to the M&StL; by 1889 which ran from Morton, Minnesota to Watertown, South Dakota (the eastern district of the WM&P; ran from Mankato, to Red Wing, Minnesota and later became part of the Chicago Great Western‚Äîthe two districts of the WM&P; were never connected). After receivership ended in the mid-1890s the M&StL; purchased the western district of the WM&P; in 1899 from the Rock Island and built an extension from Morton, Minnesota eastward toward Minneapolis connecting the western mainline with its southern mainline at Hopkins, thereby connecting the two mainlines and creating a continuous railroad system. In the 1890s the road built its Southwestern branch from Winthrop, through New Ulm, St James, and Sherburn in Minnesota, continuing to Estherville, Terril, Spencer and reaching Storm Lake in Iowa. A mile-long bridge was built over the valley of the Little Sioux River at Sioux Rapids, Iowa. Its sister railroad, the Iowa Central Railway began in Iowa in 1866 and merged with Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in 1901. Even as far back as 1870, the company looked immediately to the Iowa Central as a natural ally to capture the Iowa wheat market and to feed the hungry mills along the banks of St Anthony Falls in Minneapolis. By 1916 the combined system had become stable and was absorbing other, smaller railroads. 20th century The railroads sold land to prospective farmers at very low rates, expecting to make their profits by shipping farm products out and home goods in. They also set up small towns that would serve as shipping points and commercial centers, and attract businessmen and more farmers. The M&StL; in 1905, under the innovative leadership of its vice president and general manager L. F. Day, added lines from Watertown to Le Beau and from Conde through Aberdeen to Leola. It developed town sites along the new lines and by 1910, the new lines served 35 small communities.Don L. Hofsommer, \\"Boosterism and Townsite Development Along the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad in South Dakota,\\" Journal of the West (2003) 42#4 pp 8‚Äì16. Not all the new towns survived. The M&StL; situated LeBeau along the Missouri River on the eastern edge of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. The new town a hub for the cattle and grain industries. Livestock valued at one million dollars were shipped out in 1908, and the rail company planned a bridge across the Missouri River. Allotment of land on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in 1909 promised further growth, but the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the \\"Milwaukee Road\\") had beaten M&StL; to the punch crossing the Missouri River and becoming the last transcontinental line in 1909 when Seattle was reached ending M&StL;'s push to cross the Missouri River. LeBeau would be the western terminus of the road. By the early 1920s, however, troubles multiplied, with the murder of a local rancher, a fire that destroyed the business district, and drought that ruined ranchers and farmers alike. LeBeau became a ghost town.Don L. Hofsommer, \\"A Promise Broken: LeBeau and the Railroad,\\" South Dakota History (2003) 33#1 pp 1‚Äì17. Locomotive D-538 is preserved at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The railroad was also having financial problems as the 1920s dawned. The USRA takeover of the US railroad system during World War I turned out to be disastrous for the M&StL.; The USRA mis-managed many roads and the M&StL; was among those to suffer the worst of USRA mismanagement. By 1923, financial difficulties brought on by USRA mismanagement led the road to again enter receivership by mid-year. William Bremner was appointed receiver and the road struggled mightily throughout the remainder of the 1920s. The court overseeing the receivership would not allow expenditures that would have contributed to improved physical plant and greater efficiency, such as new locomotives, modern rolling stock and heavier rail. Bremner soldiered on overseeing the operations of the road, but there were almost no efforts made at reorganizing the road, as what little cash was available was used to pay bankruptcy creditors. In 1927, the Great Northern Railway (GN) and the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) announced their intentions to merge and would include M&StL; in the new \\"Great Northern Pacific Railway.\\" On an inspection tour of the road with Bremner as part of goodwill in the merger proceedings, GN's Ralph Budd found the M&StL; to be in deplorable condition and wrote to a colleague that he was even more convinced that M&StL; could never make it as a stand-alone carrier. Still, the case was brought before the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) which approved the merger, except that GN and NP would have to divest themselves of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;). Not wanting to part with its very lucrative link to Chicago, GN and NP dropped the merger case and M&StL; remained independent while remaining in serious financial trouble, with the Great Depression just around the corner. During the first part of the 1930s, several suggestions were made to sell off M&StL; piecemeal to whomever wanted its disparate pieces. The Illinois Central, CB&Q;, Soo Line, GN, Wabash Railroad and the Chicago and North Western Railway (C&NW;) comprised a syndicate called Associated Railways that was to determine how the M&StL; should be broken up. Competing forces with company employees and its receivers on one hand and Associated on the other brought further complexity to M&StL;'s already precarious position each lobbying their positions before the ICC on the matter. Despite the fight for the railroad to be sold to a larger operation, broken up piecemeal, or shut down entirely, Lucian Sprague took over as receiver in 1935 after Bremner unexpectedly died in November 1934. Sprague streamlined the company and its assets by selling off scrap, increasing efficiency and ordering significant abandonments, mostly in Iowa. The most notable abandonment was the portion of the Southwestern between Storm Lake, Iowa and Spencer, Iowa which was abandoned in 1936 and the huge bridge that spanned the Little Sioux River valley was dismantled. The Milwaukee Road offered to take over operations along the Storm Lake, Truesdale, Rembrandt remnants of the Southwestern north of Storm Lake thereby allowing abandonment to proceed. Other abandonments were granted in the late 1930s in Iowa and South Dakota, trimming 17 percent of railroad in Iowa alone. With these cost saving measures, Sprague began efforts at reorganizing the property in 1940. By 1942 Sprague was elevated to chairman/president and orchestrated a reorganization that year. The effort was a success and in 1943 the receivership was terminated and ownership was returned to the railroad. Despite the curious route structure of the road, it prospered as a bridge line between western and eastern markets in the year following World War II. As a result of prosperous years following the war, Sprague's successful management of the road allowed it to be exposed to corporate raiders, such as Benjamin W. Heineman who in late 1953 began orchestrating a takeover of the company and lobbing charges of malfeasance against the Sprague administration. The battle for the road continued through the remainder of 1953 and in to 1954 with both Sprague and Heineman taking to the press to malign the other. Sprague was ousted in a dramatic shareholders battle orchestrated by Heineman in May 1954. Heineman at the helm Heineman had no intention of operating the M&StL.; He was not a railroad man. He was simply a corporate raider with a great deal of capital at his disposal from his business partnerships. With M&StL;, his allegiance was not to the road's customers, or employees, or service territory, but only to shareholder value which is why he ultimately ended up winning the shareholders battle against Sprague. Few M&StL; shareholders had a direct connection to the company. Most shareholders were people from the east and Heineman played masterfully to their investment that a new management team would increase their value in the company. Further, Heineman believed a great deal of money could be made through merger rather than on operating a railroad. Toledo, Peoria & Western Not long after his arrival, however, Heineman saw great potential in the M&StL; as a stand-alone company seeing the road had modern rolling stock, no bonded debts, was making money and had paid over $6M in dividends since receivership had ended back in 1943. The road tried valiantly to acquire the Toledo, Peoria & Western in 1954 and 1955. TP&W; would extend M&StL; eastward connecting with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and Nickel Plate Road in the east, and the Santa Fe Railroad in the west. However, Heineman's heavy handed tactics in acquiring the M&StL; did little to endear himself to the shareholders of the TP&W.; The PRR and the Santa Fe quickly entered the fray attempting to prevent M&StL; from acquiring the TP&W; seeing as Heineman's group was also acquiring stock in the Monon Railroad. The presidents of both the PRR and the Santa Fe held warm relations with Lucian Sprague, but held disdain for Heineman and eventually the PRR and Santa Fe were able to jointly acquire the TP&W; at the price of $140 per share, much to the ire of Heineman who felt betrayed by TP&W; shareholders after having bid up the price thinking his bids would win out. The plan backfired and Heineman eventually left for C&NW; in 1956 after his group had gained controlling interest in that road. Minnesota Western Not long after Heineman's departure the M&StL; acquired the Minnesota Western Railroad, which was the successor line to the famous Luce Line Railroad in central Minnesota. In a move that baffles many to this day in railroad circles, the M&StL; purchase of the MW was intended to show increased focus on industrial development for the M&StL.; The move had only marginal effects on traffic along the MW and contributed only insignificant profits to the M&StL.; In early 1960, the MW was renamed Minneapolis Industrial Railway furthering the campaign of industrialization the road was trying to capture. Only one piece of rolling stock was painted in the MIR livery ‚Äì a former MW caboose. Merger with C&NW; By 1960, things were business as usual for M&StL.; At the January 1960 board meeting, members received traffic and financial forecasts for 1960. The company was in good financial condition even as competition for freight from trucks, barges and other roads was eating away at M&StL;'s traffic base. In April, however, a company meeting was called at the M&StL; office building in Minneapolis where Chairman Max Swiren and President Albert Schroeder got right to the point ‚Äì the M&StL; would become part of C&NW; (returning control to Ben Heineman), pending approval by regulators and the boards of both companies. On November 1, 1960, the C&NW; acquired the properties of the M&StL.; It is unlikely that the M&StL; would have survived the 1960s as a stand-alone company. The merger of the Hill Lines in 1970 would have eventually done in the company as M&StL; enjoyed significant bridge traffic from both GN and NP. The BN merger would have meant a massive loss of bridge traffic as BN would have done what it could to keep that traffic on its own rails. M&StL; was losing less-than-carload (LCL) traffic to the trucking and barge industries which eroded traffic further. The other Granger mergers as well as bankruptcies would have crippled M&StL; remaining bridge connections. Losing out on the TP&W; property in the mid-1950s was a significant setback for the company. Things might have turned out different for the M&StL; had it been able to acquire the TP&W.; Perhaps the company would have eventually merged with a partner other than C&NW.; In the end, Chairmen Swiren and President Schroeder recognized that the losses the M&StL; had already suffered ‚Äì and other losses it was sure to suffer in the future ‚Äì was a clear indication that merger was really the only option left for the company. So, the company was sold when its value was as high as the Directorate thought they could get for their company. Later years along the M&StL; By 1963, long-haul traffic had been transferred to former C&NW; routes. Large sections of the former M&StL; were abandoned in the 1960s and 1970s. The MW was ripped up in two stages between 1968 and 1970. In the end, Ralph Budd had been right about the M&StL; in 1927 predicting the company would never survive. The company survived another 33 years to 1960, but the M&StL; was one of the earliest victims of the mass mergers in the railroad industry of the 1950s and 1960s ending M&StL;'s career as a stand-alone carrier and resulting in the eventual abandonment of nearly the entire property. The M&StL; today Today only a few short segments of the old M&StL; remain in use. In Minnesota, The Minnesota Valley Regional Railroad Authority owns the former M&StL; line from Norwood Young America to Hanley Falls and is currently operated by Twin Cities & Western affiliate Minnesota Prairie Line. The line from Hanley Falls to Madison is owned by the BNSF Railroad. The Montgomery Spur, which runs from Merriam Junction just south of Shakopee to Montgomery, is operated by the Union Pacific. The Minneapolis Industrial Railway west of I494 was completely abandoned by 1970. Between downtown Minneapolis and Golden Valley, the far eastern portion of the MIR survives today as UP's Golden Valley Industrial Lead. The Chaska Industrial Lead from Merriam Junction to downtown Chaska was abandoned by UP following a trestle collapse along the Minnesota River in the spring of 2007 due to high water. UP later sold the Chaska Industrial Lead corridor to a coalition of area government entities to preserve it for future transportation use, sewer lines, and recreational trails. In Iowa, UP operates the line from Mallard to Grand Junction, from Northwood through Mason City to Rockwell, and Grinnell to Oskaloosa. The now-abandoned route owned by Iowa Pacific Railroad from Steamboat Rock to Marshalltown, Iowa, was scrapped and removed in 2015. Canadian National (owner of the former Illinois Central) operated a short spur from Ackley, Iowa northwards to Geneva, Iowa into the early 2000s. While the CN connection to the former M&StL; mainline in Ackley still exists to interchange with the Iowa River Railroad, the at-grade railroad crossing over the CN has been removed, cutting off access to the line northward to Geneva. Most of the M&StL; Mississippi River bridge still stands between Keithsburg, Illinois and Oakville, Iowa. Passenger service While the primary business of the M&StL; was the haulage of freight, the railroad also operated a limited number of passenger train services. Since the railroad's route structure was not based on direct lines between major American cities, long-distance passenger service was generally not competitive with the trains of larger railroads. The premiere M&StL; passenger train was the North Star Limited, which operated from Minneapolis to Albia, Iowa on the M&StL;, and then continued to St. Louis via the Wabash Railroad. The North Star Limited was discontinued in 1935. In 1929, the M&StL; began acquiring a number of gas- electric railcars‚Äîself-propelled vehicles that included compartments for baggage/express and mail. Some of the gas-electrics also included passenger compartments, and all were able to tow additional passenger and express cars as necessary. Soon, the railcars provided nearly all of the railroad's meager passenger service. The railroad also purchased two Budd RDC's in 1957 for Minneapolis ‚Äì Des Moines service, but the cars proved unsuccessful and they were sold the following year. M&StL; passenger service declined throughout the 1950s, the result of significant drops in mail, express, and passenger revenue. The last M&StL; passenger services‚Äîtrains 13 and 14 between Minneapolis and Watertown, South Dakota‚Äîmade their final departures on July 20, 1960.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Toronto Blue Jays, Detroit Tigers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox, and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim between 1999 and 2014. Primarily a shortstop, he was also a utility infielder, with the ability to also play second base, third base and left field. He also appeared in one extra inning game in 2013 as an emergency pitcher. Known for his defensive ability, he posted a career fielding percentage of .974 in over 6,450 innings. High school and college McDonald graduated from East Lyme High School in East Lyme, Connecticut. When he was not drafted by any major league baseball team in his initial draft year, he attended University of Connecticut Avery Point Campus, where he was NJCAA Division II All-American in 1994 as shortstop. He went on to play at Providence College in 1995 and 1996 on a partial scholarship, earning All-New England honors as a member of one of the last baseball teams before the college discontinued its baseball program. In 1995, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. After he was drafted in 1996, he left Providence to pursue a career in professional baseball. At that time he was still several courses short of completing a degree; he earned his degree in 2010 http://www.friars.com/genrel/110315aaa.html Professional career=Minor league career McDonald was drafted in the 12th round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft (363rd overall) by the Cleveland Indians, and entered the Indians' minor league system. In 1996, he played with the Watertown Indians of the Single A New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League, then moved to the Kinston Indians of the Single A Carolina League in 1997. In 1998, he was invited to the Indians' spring training camp, and moved up to the Akron Aeros of the Double A Eastern League, where his defensive plays at shortstop made him a popular player with the fans. McDonald split 1999 between Akron and the Buffalo Bisons of the Triple A International League and was also called up to the major leagues for a short stint. McDonald also appeared in a number of games for the Indians in 2000 and 2001, spending the remainder of each season in Buffalo. Cleveland Indians (1999‚Äì2004) McDonald made his major league debut for Cleveland on July 4, 1999, and appeared in 18 games for the Indians that season. He appeared in 9 games for the Indians in 2000, another 17 games in 2001, and in 2002, he made his move to the Indians' roster, appearing in 93 games. The Indians, taking advantage of McDonald's popularity in Akron, used McDonald in promotions there to draw Aeros fans to Cleveland. After three full seasons with the Indians, McDonald was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays on December 2, 2004, in exchange for Tom Mastny. In his six full and partial seasons with Cleveland, McDonald batted .231, with a fielding average of .971. Toronto Blue Jays/Detroit Tigers (2005) During the first part of the 2005 season with the Blue Jays, McDonald was primarily a backup for Russ Adams at shortstop, and recorded a .290 batting average in 37 games. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers on July 22 for future considerations. During the remainder of the season with Detroit, McDonald hit .260 with a .308 on-base percentage in 31 games. Toronto Blue Jays (2006‚Äì2011) On November 10, 2005, the Tigers sent him back to the Toronto Blue Jays for cash considerations, in effect completing the earlier trade by trading John McDonald for himself. Only three other players have been traded for themselves in this manner (Harry Chiti, Dickie Noles, and Brad Gulden). During the 2006 season, McDonald was the starting shortstop for the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 25, 2006, he hit his first career grand slam in a game against the Seattle Mariners and also drove in a career high of five runs. Although McDonald showed good defensive skills, his offensive hitting skills were weak‚Äîhe had a .223 batting average, a .271 slugging percentage and a .308 on-base percentage during the 2006 season. Toronto Blue Jays in 2007 spring training In an attempt to inject some stronger hitting into the shortstop position, the Blue Jays obtained Royce Clayton in the off-season, and McDonald and Clayton started the 2007 season sharing shortstop duties. McDonald also started some games at third base as Troy Glaus's backup. Later in the season, after demonstrating his strong defensive abilities, McDonald replaced Clayton as the everyday starting shortstop, and Clayton was subsequently released. McDonald took the opportunity as starting shortstop to make some exceptional defensive plays (often in conjunction with fellow infielders Aaron Hill and Lyle Overbay). He was considered by some baseball writers to be a Gold Glove contender after leading AL shortstops with a .986 in fielding percentage. (Orlando Cabrera was subsequently chosen.) Due in large part to his defensive abilities, McDonald received a 2-year contract extension from the Blue Jays reportedly worth $3.8 million. In a poll of viewers on Rogers Sportsnet, McDonald was voted the most popular Blue Jay, narrowly edging out Cy Young- winning pitcher Roy Halladay. Despite his contract extension, McDonald again started another season, 2008 as the back-up shortstop due to the Blue Jays' off-season acquisition of all-star shortstop David Eckstein. However, when Eckstein was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 31, McDonald once again became the starting shortstop. At the start of the 2009 season, McDonald again found himself the back-up shortstop, this time behind newly acquired Marco Scutaro. However, McDonald once again became the starting shortstop when Scutaro was injured late in the season. McDonald had a batting average of .258 in 2009. His slugging percentage of .271, on-base percentage of .384 and 4 home runs were career highs. On November 25, 2009, the Blue Jays re-signed McDonald to a 2-year $3-million dollar contract. In the 2010 season, McDonald again began as the back-up shortstop, this time behind Yunel Escobar. McDonald missed much of the month of June to spend time with his ailing father, who would eventually pass away. McDonald returned to the lineup on June 20, Father's Day, hitting a home run in his only at-bat, afterward dedicating it to his father. McDonald hit a career high 6 home runs in 2010, passing his previous season high of 4. McDonald started the 2011 season as a non-starting utility bench player, able to enter the game as a pinch runner, or as a replacement infielder or left fielder. He also occasionally started as an infielder when the manager wanted to give the regular starting player a day off. (For example, on July 1, 2011 he started at second base in order to give Aaron Hill a day off, but when shortstop Yunel Escobar left the game in the first inning after being hit by a pitch, McDonald moved to shortstop.) On April 22, 2011, McDonald came into a game against the Tampa Bay Rays to replace an injured Jayson Nix, and hit his first career walk-off home run, a 2-run homer in the 11th inning. On May 28, 2011, McDonald was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right groin. Mike McCoy was called up to take his place. McDonald was activated from the DL on June 17, 2011. =Nicknames as a Blue Jay= While in Toronto, McDonald was popularly known in the media and by Blue Jays fans as \\"Johnny Mac\\". Due to some of his outstanding defensive plays, local media also dubbed him \\"Magic Man\\" (the title of a popular 1976 hit song by Heart), and \\"The Prime Minister of Defence\\" (a word play on the similarly named first prime minister of Canada, John A. Macdonald). Arizona Diamondbacks (2011‚Äì2012) On August 23, 2011, McDonald, was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks, along with teammate Aaron Hill, for Kelly Johnson. During his time in Arizona, McDonald served as the Diamondbacks' primary shortstop following the trade in 2011 but shared his duties with Willie Bloomquist and Stephen Drew in 2012. On November 2, 2011, the Diamondbacks re-signed McDonald to a 2-year $3-million dollar contract. Pittsburgh Pirates (2013) On March 20, 2013, McDonald was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. McDonald was placed on the disabled list on May 15 with a low back strain. On May 27, McDonald started a rehab assignment with the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. Return to Cleveland Indians (2013) On June 10, 2013, McDonald was traded to the Cleveland Indians for a player to be named later or cash considerations. On June 26, McDonald was designated for assignment when Asdr√∫bal Cabrera was activated from the disabled list. McDonald was used as a defensive replacement during his short return to Cleveland, and was hitless in 7 at-bats. Philadelphia Phillies (2013) McDonald was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on June 27, 2013, in exchange for cash considerations or a player to be named later. On August 24, McDonald appeared as a pitcher for the first time in his career, and struck out Tuffy Gosewisch in his of an inning. Boston Red Sox (2013) On August 31, 2013, McDonald was traded to Boston Red Sox in exchange for minor league pitcher Nefi Ogando. As McDonald was acquired prior to September 1, he was eligible to play in the postseason. He appeared in 6 games for the Red Sox in the regular season, hitting .250 in 8 at-bats. McDonald was not included on the postseason roster, but following the Red Sox' 2013 World Series victory, was awarded a World Series ring. Los Angeles Angels (2014) On January 16, 2014, McDonald signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels, with an invitation to attend their spring training camp to try out for a utility infielder position. He was placed on the active roster for the start of the regular season. Retirement On January 7, 2015, McDonald announced his retirement from professional baseball. Personal life McDonald met his wife-to-be, Maura, in a freshman English class at Providence College in 1995. They have two children, Jacqueline and Anthony. When McDonald left Providence College in 1996, he was only six courses shy of earning his degree. Encouraged by his wife to complete his studies while still playing baseball, he enrolled in Providence College School of Continuing Education in 2006, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Liberal Studies in 2010. He was able to accept his degree from the college president on July 13, 2010, during the annual break for the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

He played for the University of Michigan from 1994 to 1995. He next played nine seasons in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills (1996‚Äì2002) and Pittsburgh Steelers (2003‚Äì2004). In 2007, he accepted a position as the regional director of the Family Research Council. He announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2009. Playing career=Zeeland Riemersma was born in Evansville, Indiana and grew up in Zeeland, Michigan. In 1991, he graduated from Zeeland High School, where he was a star athlete in three sports. He became Zeeland's all-time leading scorer in basketball, played baseball for two seasons, and was the quarterback for the football team. Michigan Riemersma enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1991. Originally recruited by Michigan as a quarterback, Riemersma appeared in three games at that position in the 1992 and 1993 seasons. On September 26, 1992, he made his debut as a redshirt freshman against the University of Houston. He came into the game as a substitute for Todd Collins in the third quarter and completed all three passes he attempted for 43 yards, including a 14-yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer in the fourth quarter. He completed a total of six of eleven passes for 79 yards the 1992 and 1993 seasons. In 1994, Riemersma suffered a rotator cuff injury, which ended his career as a quarterback. Michigan head coach Gary Moeller switched Riemersma to the tight end position, where he played in the 1994 and 1995 seasons. Interviewed in 2009, Riemersma pointed to the rotator cuff injury as \\"divine intervention,\\" saying, \\"Some called the injury luck. I called it divine intervention. I never would have played in the NFL as a quarterback. It was an injury that parlayed into an NFL career.\\" During the 1994 season, Riemersma became one of quarterback Todd Collins' favorite targets, finishing as the team's third leading receiver behind Amani Toomer and Mercury Hayes. He caught 33 passes for 336 yards and two touchdowns in 1994. His most productive games were against Notre Dame (5 catches for 69 yards and a touchdown) and Wisconsin (8 catches for 79 yards and a touchdown). In 1995, Riemersma added another 41 catches for 370 yards and a touchdown. His best games of the 1995 season came against Virginia and Michigan State. He connected with Scott Dreisbach for seven catches and 71 yards in the Wolverines' come-from-behind 18-17 win over Virginia in the season opener, and he caught a career-high nine passes, good for 70 yards, in a 28-25 loss to the Spartans. The longest reception of his college career was a 35-yard catch in Michigan's 31-23 win over Ohio State in 1995. In two seasons as Michigan's tight end, Reimersma caught 74 passes for 706 yards. While completing his degree at Michigan, Riemersma twice earned Academic All-Big Ten Conference awards. He also won both the Meyer Morton Award and the Arthur Robinson Scholarship Award while attending Michigan. NFLBuffalo Bills= Riemersma was drafted by the Buffalo Bills as the 35th pick of the 7th round (244th pick overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft. He spent seven seasons in Buffalo from 1996 to 2002, appearing in 90 games, 65 as a starter. As a tight end for the Bills, he had 221 receptions for 2,304 yards and 20 touchdowns. As a rookie in 1996, Riemersma did not see any action. In his second season he appeared in all 16 games for the Bills, including eight as a starter. He caught 26 passes for 208 yards and two touchdowns. In 1998, Riemersma had a career-high six touchdowns in 16 games for the Bills. He had his first career two-touchdown game in a November 2000 win over the Miami Dolphins. From 1999 to 2001, he missed only six games in four years, and accumulated 1,808 receiving yards and 12 touchdowns. In a September 2000 game against the Green Bay Packers, Riemersma had his second career two-touchdown game and 70 receiving yards. After the game, teammate Eric Moulds said, \\"A couple of times they tried to double me and left Jay wide open down the field. We'll take that matchup all day. If you're going to leave Jay Riemersma one- on-one with a linebacker, you're going to lose most of the time.\\" He had his best season in 2001. He started 15 games for the 2001 Bills and caught 53 passes for 590 yards. Riemersma was plagued by injuries during his six years with the Bills. He underwent eight surgeries during his NFL career. His offensive production declined in 2002 to 32 receptions for 350 yards, and for the first time in his NFL career, Riemersma did not score a touchdown in 2002. In February 2003, the Bills announced that they intended to release Riemersma unless he accepted a significant pay cut. Bills president Tom Donahoe said the club was asking Riemersma to restructure the final year of his contract, reportedly worth $3.5 million. The Bills officially released Riemersma in late February 2003. =Pittsburgh Steelers= In March 2003, Riemersma signed a three-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers worth almost $4 million. In his first game for the Steelers, a 34-15 win over the Baltimore Ravens on September 7, 2003, Riemersma \\"beat Baltimore safety Ed Reed badly\\" for a 20-yard touchdown pass from Tommy Maddox. On the next drive, Ravens safety Gary Baxter followed Riemersma and left Hines Ward wide open for a 28-yard touchdown catch. After the game, Steelers coach Bill Cowher said, \\"Jay Riemersma adds a dimension we never had. He gives you a guy that you better start thinking about down the middle of the field.\\" He played for Pittsburgh in 2003 and 2004 before rupturing his right Achilles tendon on a 26-yard touchdown reception against the Jacksonville Jaguars in December 2004. At the time of the injury, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported, \\"Jay Riemersma caught a touchdown pass in his first game with the Steelers and his last, but that's about the extent of any good fortune the tight end has had in his two seasons here.\\" Riemersma did not play another game in the NFL after suffering the Achilles tendon injury. In February 2005, the Steelers released Riemersma in a salary cap move required after the Steelers' 15-1 performance in 2004 triggered performance bonuses, including a $2 million bonus to Ben Roethlisberger. Riemersma spent the 2005 season coaching high school football and recovering from his injury. In January 2006, Riemersma announced that he would not attempt a comeback and that he was retiring from the NFL. His agent, said at the time that the nature and severity of the injury would make it too difficult for Riemersma to play again. In nine NFL seasons, Riemersma played in 112 games (85 as a starter) and caught 221 passes for 2,524 yards and 23 touchdowns. Football coach In August 2005, while trying to rehabilitate his Achilles tendon, Riemersma returned to western Michigan and took on a one- year assignment as the football coach at Zeeland East High School. After announcing his retirement from the NFL in January 2006, Riemersma returned for two more seasons as the football coach at Zeeland East. In three years as the football coach from 2005 to 2007, Riemersma compiled a record of 1-26. In 2008, Riemersma said, \\"We won just one game while I was there. I'm really proud, though, of what we tried to accomplish in building character in the kids.\\" In 2009, Riemersma was inducted into the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame. Politics In November 2007, Riemersma joined Family Research Council, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., as the director of a six- state region that includes Michigan. In September 2009, Riemersma announced that he would run for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican in Michigan's 2nd congressional district. The seat was held by Rep. Peter Hoekstra who is vacating it to run for Governor of Michigan. Riemersma said he would fight against abortion, taxes and big government. He was ultimately defeated in the primary election by Bill Huizenga, who would go on to win the general election.Bill Huizenga edges out former NFL player Jay Riemersma by less than 700 in race for Congress Roelofs,Ted. The Grand Rapids Press. August 4, 2010. In February 2010, Riemersma drew attention when he announced his support for Tim Tebow's Focus on the Family Super Bowl advertisement. Personal Jay, his wife Cara, their three children, Sophie, Trip, and Nick, and their dog Penny reside in Holland, Michigan. Riemersma is an active member of Parkside Bible Church in Holland. Riemersma also serves on the Board of Directors of the American Red Cross, Ottawa County Chapter.

He was the duke of Champagne from the early 690s. Drogo was born shortly after his parents' marriage, which probably took place in 675 or just after. In the early 680s, Pippin arranged the marriage of Drogo with Anstrudis (or Adaltrudis), the daughter of Waratto, the mayor of the palace in Neustria, and his wife Ansfledis. The marriage took place toward the end of the decade or in the early 690s. Drogo and Anstrudis had four sons: Arnulf, who succeeded him as duke of Champagne; Hugh, who entered the church and rose to become an archbishop; Gotfrid; and Pippin; The marriage of Drogo and Anstrudis increased his father Pippin's influence in Neustria. Waratto's family properties were located mainly in the vicinity of Rouen. Drogo, however, was made duke in Champagne, a frontier region between Neustria and Austrasia. His power in Champagne was enhanced through his control of the monastery of Montier-en-Der and possibly the monastery of Hautvillers. The Liber Historiae Francorum, a history of the Franks written in Neustria in 727, portrays the Austrasian Drogo as sympathetic to the Neustrians because of his marital connections. He did, however, fall foul of the abbey of Saint-Denis, which sued him in the king's court in a property dispute. King Childebert III ruled in Saint-Denis's favour. Drogo also lost a lawsuit over the villa of Noisy-sur-Oise with the monastery of Tussonval in 697. Drogo predeceased his father, dying in 707, according to the Gesta abbatum Fontanellensium, or in 708, according to most of the annals. He was buried in the church of Saint Arnulf at Metz, to which his four sons made a grant of land in his honour in June 715. The Annales Mettenses record that Grimoald succeeded Drogo in all his offices, but in fact his son Arnulf succeeded him as duke. The death of Drogo was perceived by later generations as a pivotal event in the history of the Carolingian dynasty. Several of the imperial annals written in the late eighth century begin their year-by-year accounts with 708. These include the Annales Alamannici, Annales Nazariani and Annales Laureshamenses.

He is best known for the eponymous Adams' catalyst, and his work did much to determine the composition of naturally occurring substances such as complex vegetable oils and plant alkaloids. As the Department Head of Chemistry at the University of Illinois from 1926 to 1954, he also greatly influenced graduate education in America, taught over 250 Ph.D. students and postgraduate students, and served the U.S. as a scientist at the highest levels during World War I and World War II.  Early life  Adams was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in a prosperous neighborhood in South Boston, the last child in a gifted family that included Adams's three older sisters (two went to Radcliffe College and one to Smith College). Adams was part of the prominent Adams family, and was descended from John Adams's grandfather. Adams attending Boston Latin School and Cambridge Latin High School (now called Cambridge Rindge and Latin). In 1900, the family moved to Cambridge, which was closer to the two colleges. Adams entered Harvard University in 1905 and completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree in three years. In his first year, he earned a John Harvard Honorary Scholarship by getting four As, and in his last year he took advanced courses and began research in organic chemistry under H.A. Torrey. His years at Harvard were undistinguished, earning high grades in chemistry (his major) and mining (his minor). After graduation from Harvard in 1909 he worked towards his Ph.D. at Radcliffe College supported by a teaching assistantship. Torrey died unexpectedly in 1910, so Adams finished his Ph.D. under Charles Loring Jackson, George Shannon Forbes, and Latham Clarke. In 1912 he was initiated as a brother of Alpha Chi Sigma at Omicron Chapter at Harvard.http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=268 As an outstanding Ph.D. of 1912, Adams received a Parker Traveling Scholarship for 1912 and 1913, which he used to work at the laboratory of Emil Fischer and Otto Diels in Berlin, Germany and that of Richard Willst√§tter in Dahlem outside of Berlin. After returning from Europe in 1913, Adams returned to Harvard and worked as a research assistant for Charles L. Jackson for $800 a year. During the next three years he taught organic chemistry at Harvard and Radcliffe, initiated the first elementary organic chemistry laboratory at Harvard and began his own research program. Several other prominent contemporaries of Adams at Harvard Graduate School were Elmer Keiser Bolton, Farrington Daniels, Frank C. Whitmore, James B. Sumner and James Bryant Conant.  Academic career  In 1916, Adams accepted an offer of an assistant professorship from William A. Noyes, head of the chemistry department at University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. He began a career at UIUC that would span 56 years. Adams succeeded Noyes as department head in 1926, and remained in that position until 1954. During this time, Adams made several well-known discoveries. Roger Adams and his students developed the so-called Adams' catalyst, which is one of the most readily-prepared and active catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. The catalyst can be prepared by fusing sodium nitrate with chloroplatinic acid or ammonium chloroplatinate. Adams's group also developed a low-pressure apparatus for using the catalyst, which had a profound effect in the synthesis and structural elucidation of organic compounds as well as biochemical compounds. Working at the Noyes Laboratory, Adams and his more than 250 graduate students made many significant discoveries: * Synthesis of chloralkyl esters by combining aldehydes and acyl chlorides. * That aliphatic acid anhydrides effectively form ketones in the Friedel-Crafts reaction. * Determination of the structure of disalicylaldehyde and dehydroacetic acid. * A method of synthesizing polyhydroxyanthraquinones with precisely-known stereochemistry using phthalides. * Determination of the structures of leprosy drugs chaulmoogric acid and hydnocarpic acid and the synthesis of their dihydro derivatives. * Determination of the structure of gossypol for the cottonseed industry. * Isolated and identified cannabidiol from Cannabis sativa, showed its relationship to cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol. * Synthesized cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol analogs. * Studies of Senecio and Crotalaria alkaloids that opened two fields of study:pyrrolizidine and large-ring diester chemistry. At UIUC, Adams took charge of the Organic Chemical Manufactures (\\"prep labs\\") started by his predecessor C.G. Derick for the synthesis of organic compounds from Germany that were cut off by the Blockade of Germany. The lab was expanded and reorganized with the help of students, particularly Ernest H. Volwiler and C.S. (Speed) Marvel. Strict cost accounting procedures were implemented in the lab, so that it became a financial as well as scientific success. The tested procedures developed in the lab led to the annual publication of the journal Organic Syntheses, which James Bryant Conant referred to as the \\"Adams Annual.\\" Adams vigorously researched methods of preparing local anaesthetics with Oliver Kamm who was also on the faculty of UIUC and a consultant to Abbott Laboratories in a relationship that lasted into the 1960s. Ernest H. Volwiler, Adams' first Ph.D. student, joined Abbott as a chemist in 1918. In 1917, Adams was drawn into research for the U.S. Army into poison gases at American University in Washington, D.C.; There he and Conant headed research groups and E.P. Kohler, an old faculty friend of Adams from Harvard, was in charge of the Offense Section. Adams' return to UIUC began a period (1918‚Äì1926) of intense research, with 45 Ph.D. students that resulted in 73 publications. In July 1940, Vannevar Bush was working to mobilize American scientists in the World War II war effort. Bush wanted to bring Adams into the National Defense Research Committee that he was organizing for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Many believed that Adams was the leading organic chemist in the United States, and Adams friend and former Harvard colleague James Bryant Conant was intent on Adams leading the effort to develop new explosives and create synthetic chemicals. However, Bush's efforts were stalled in getting Adams a security clearance. The Army cleared Adams, but the Navy refused. At this time the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover was doing surveillance on \\"suspect American citizens\\" and had been keeping a file on Roger Adams. The FBI had informed Hoover that Adams was a leading member of an apparent Communist front group called the Lincoln's Birthday Committee for the Advancement of Science. The FBI also had information that Adams was a contributing member of a suspect Japanese propaganda magazine. Adams was also suspect in the eyes of the FBI because he was doing studies into the chemical mechanisms by which the plant cannabis sativa (marijuana) affects the brain. The plant had been effectively banned by the passage of the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. For the purposes of this research Adams had obtained red oil extract of the plant legally from the United States Department of the Treasury. In 1939, this was the main focus of Adams' work. For these reasons the Office of Naval Intelligence said it would never approve security clearance for Adams. Hoover saw that political pressure was building to give Adams security clearance and that the FBI might have its facts wrong, so eventually backed down, indicating that \\"Professor Adams\\" is a very common name and there may be some confusion. However, Hoover continued to be suspicious of the political loyalties of the scientists involved in the World War II mobilization because of their internationalist worldview. In the end Roger Adams got his security clearance and took charge of a successful effort to manufacture synthetic rubber to replace natural rubber supplies from the Far East that had been cut off by the war. This was a continuation of the work done by E.K. Bolton (Adams's friend from Harvard) at DuPont. In Adams's case, the FBI had much of its information wrong. Adams was politically active, but not affiliated with any group called the Lincoln's Birthday Committee for the Advancement of Science. He was a member of the Lincoln's Birthday Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom (LBCDIF), which was founded by the prominent anthropologist Franz Boas to discredit Nazi racial policies. Because of Adams significant contribution to the field, in 1959, the Roger Adams Award was established as an ACS National Award to recognize outstanding contributions to the field of organic chemistry. The award is given every other year where the award address is provided at the National Organic Chemistry Symposium, which is organized by the ACS Division of Organic Chemistry. Roger Adams was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1967 in the area of Science.

Butler, Okinawa, Japan. 3rd MLG provides combat service support (CSS) to III MEF units above the organic capability. CSS is the essential capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of operating forces in theater at all levels of war. Combat service support includes, but is not limited, to supply, maintenance, transportation, general engineering, health services, and other services required by aviation and ground combat forces to permit those units to accomplish their missions.  Mission  As a multi-function Combat Service Support Group, enable III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) by providing CSS, conducting intermediate level supply, field level maintenance, material distribution, equipment fielding, and procurement management to support deployed Marine air-ground task forces (MAGTFs) in order to enhance and preserve the expeditionary nature and combat power of III MEF.  History = 3rd Force Service Regiment (3rd FSR)  3d MLG was originally activated on Camp Courtney, Okinawa, Japan as the 3d Force Service Regiment on 1 May 1958 under the 3d Marine Division (MARDIV). During November 1961, the Regiment was relocated to Camp Sukiran, Okinawa, Japan. In August 1965, 3d FSR was officially detached from 3d MARDIV and placed under operational control of Commanding General, Fleet Marine Forces, Pacific. From 1965 through 1966, elements of 3d FSR were deployed to support the war in Vietnam. Throughout most of 1965, a Force Logistic Support Group in Da Nang, which was subordinate to 3d FSR provided logistical support for approximately 38,000 Marines of the 3d Marine Division and 1st Marine Air Wing.The Marines in Vietnam 1954‚Äì1973 an Anthology and Annotated Bibliography Because of the deterioration of equipment in South Vietnam, the Commanding General Fleet Marine Forces Pacific was granted authority to conduct fifth echelon maintenance and rebuild equipment in the western Pacific. From 1966 to 1970, 3d FSR was granted funds and provided guidance to conduct fifth echelon maintenance within its capabilities and contract out the remainder instead of returning equipment to the United States which proved to be one of the great logistical decisions of Vietnam.The Marines in Vietnam 1954‚Äì1973 an Anthology and Annotated BibliographyOne-Round War: Scout-Snipers in Vietnam On 29 December 1966, Camp Sukiran, where 3d FSR was located, was re-dedicated as Camp Foster.  3rd Force Service Support Group (3rd FSSG)  On 6 March 1976, the 3rd Force Service Support Regiment was re-designated 3rd Force Service Support Group (3d FSSG) as part of the implementation of new doctrine, organization and structure for combat service support in the Marine Corps. Upon transition, the command consisted of Headquarters and Service Battalion, Maintenance Battalion, Support Battalion, Motor Transport Battalion, Medical Battalion, Engineer Support Battalion, and four dental companies.Fiscal year 1977 authorization for military procurement, research and development, and active duty, selected reserve and civilian personnel strengths : hearings before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, second session, on S. 2965 The command later consisted of Headquarters and Service Battalion, 3rd Materiel Readiness Battalion, headquartered at Camp Kinser; 3rd Dental Battalion and 3rd Transportation Support Battalion located at Camp Foster; 3rd Medical Battalion, 9th Engineer Support Battalion at Camp Hansen, Electronics Maintenance Company (ELMACO) located at Camp Kinser, with a detachment platoon at Camp Hansen; Combat Service Support Detachment 76 located at Camp Fuji, Japan; Combat Service Support Detachment 36 located at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan; and Combat Service Support Group 3, located at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. During October 1978, 3d FSSG was relocated to the Makiminato Service Area, Okinawa which was later rededicated as Camp Kinser on 21 January 1980. = Operation Provide Comfort = After the decision on 5 April 1991 to commit American resources to assist in humanitarian operations in Iraq in the aftermath of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, a contingency Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) was created using forces from the 3d Force Service Support Group. Designated as Contingency MAGTF 1-91, the command element came from 3d FSSG with the subordinate ground combat element coming from 3d Marine Division, the aviation combat element came from 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, and the combat service support element came from 3d FSSG's own Company B, 3d Landing Support Battalion. Company B was further reinforced by service support detachments from 3d Supply Battalion, two dumpsite sections and repair personnel from 3d Maintenance Battalion, administrative personnel from Headquarters and Service Battalion, and a detachment from 9th Engineer Support Battalion. CMAGTF 1-91 was deployed on 6 May 1991.Humanitarian Operations in Northern Iraq, 1991 with Marines in Operation Provide Comfort = Operation Unified Assistance = In early-January 2005, elements of 3d FSSG rapidly deployed to Sri Lanka and Indonesia to support Operation Unified Assistance, the tsunami relief efforts. = Pakistan Earthquake Relief = This was followed up with a deployment to Pakistan to aid in the relief efforts after the 2005 Kashmir 7.6-magnitude earthquake that shook the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan on 8 October 2005, leaving almost 100,000 dead and nearly 3 million Pakistanis homeless. As the Pakistanis braced for the impending annual Himalayan winter, III Marine Expeditionary Force deployed elements (approx. 240 Marines and Sailors) of 3d FSSG to form a humanitarian relief team, later named Combined Medical Relief Team-3 (CMRT-3) in support of Operation LIFELINE, Pakistan. CMRT-3 set up a surgical hospital at the foothills of the Himalayan mountains of Pakistan and worked side-by-side with Pakistani military forces, NGOs, governmental agencies, and the UN to help save lives and assist in the recovery efforts. More than 15,000 Pakistanis were treated and over 6.5 million pounds of relief supplies were provided through 7 March 2006 when CMRT-3 redeployed back to Okinawa, Japan.  3d Marine Logistics Group (3d MLG)  On 28 October 2005, the 3rd Force Service Support Group was officially re-designated the 3d Marine Logistics Group. The new designation is meant to signify enhanced logistical support capabilities across the MAGTF by creating units that maintain working relationships with 3d Marine Division and 4th Marine Regiment and are currently task organized to deploy.

This occurs chiefly with black tea that is blended to make most tea bags but can also occur with such teas as Pu-erh, where leaves are blended from different regions before being compressed. The aim of blending is to create a well-balanced flavour using different origins and characters. This also allows for variations in tea leaf quality and differences from season to season to be smoothed out. The one golden rule of blending is this: Every blend must taste the same as the previous one, so a consumer will not be able to detect a difference in flavour from one purchase to the next. There are various teas which have additives or different processing than \\"pure\\" varieties. Tea is able to easily receive any aroma, which may cause problems in processing, transportation or storage of tea, but can be also advantageously used to prepare scented teas. Tea can be flavoured in large blending drums with perfumes, flavourants, or essential oils added. Although blending and scenting teas can add an additional dimension to tea, the process may also sometimes be used to cover and obscure the quality of sub-standard teas. Varieties of blended tea ; Breakfast: Generally a blend of different black teas that are robust and full-bodied, and go well with milk. Some types are English breakfast, Irish breakfast and Scottish breakfast. ; Afternoon tea: These blends (of black teas) are generally lighter than breakfast blends. Both breakfast and afternoon blends are popular in the British Isles, for example, Prince of Wales tea blend. ; Russian Caravan: A popular blend, Russian Caravan harks back to the days when tea was hauled to Russia from China on camelback. It often contains a bit of smoky lapsang souchong, though its base is typically Keemun or Dian Hong. Some also contain oolong. Flavoured and scented teas Although many teas are still flavoured directly with flowers, herbs, spices, or even smoke, teas with more specialized flavours are produced through the addition of flavourants or perfumes. This is particularly true for tea blends with pronounced fruit or flower aromas, which cannot be achieved with the original ingredients. Some firms such as Mariage Fr√®res and Kusmi Tea have become quite famous for their perfumed teas. Due to the number of scents that can be produced by the mentioned artificial methods, the section will concentrate on teas flavoured directly with the original scent materials. Flowers Chinese osmanthus black tea A variety of flowers are used to flavour teas. Although flowers are used to scent teas directly, most flower-scented teas on the market use perfumes and aromas to augment or replace the use of flowers. The most popular of these teas include the flowers of the following: *Jasmine: Spread with jasmine flowers while oxidizing, and occasionally some are left in the tea as a decoration. Jasmine is most commonly used to flavour green teas to produce jasmine tea, although sometimes it is used to flavour light oolong teas such as baozhong tea *Osmanthus: In China, osmanthus tea (called gu√¨ huƒÅ ch√°, Ê°ÇËä±Ëå∂) is produced by combining dried sweet osmanthus (Osmanthus fragrans) flowers (gu√¨ huƒÅ, Ê°ÇËä±) with black or green tea leaves in much the same manner the more familiar jasmine tea combines jasmine flowers with tea leaves. The flowers are spread while oxidizing, and occasionally some are left in the tea as a decoration. This flower gives the tea a mild peach flavour. It is the second most popular scented tea (after jasmine) in China. Vietnamese lotus green tea *Rose: Spread with rose flowers while oxidizing, occasionally some are left in the tea as a decoration. In China, roses are usually used to scent black tea and the resulting tea is called rose congou. *Chrysanthemum: The flowers are often brewed alone as a chrysanthemum tisane, but it is also commonly mixed with pu- erh tea to make chrysanthemum pu-erh. *Lotus: Vietnamese lotus tea is made by stuffing green tea leaves into the blossom of Nelumbo nucifera and allowing the scent to be absorbed overnight. Another common technique for making this tea is by jarring or baking the tea leaves with the fragrant stamens of the flower multiple times. *Orchid: Including vanilla. Herbs  *Mint: Touareg tea consists of a mixture of green teas and any variety of the mint plants (known as nana), and is popular in the Middle East and desert areas of North Africa. See also Peppermint tea. *Pandan: Pandan, also known as screwpine, is a popular additive to green or black tea in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Other flavourants *Citrus peel : The best known of this class is Earl Grey tea, which is made by infusing black teas with citrus or bergamot peel. More typically, however, an essential oil or perfume blend of the citrus fruit is used. *Smoke: One type in this class is lapsang souchong, which is produced by drying black tea over smoking pine needles, which produces a striking smoky odor and flavour. The best varieties are not overwhelmed by the smoke, but retain subtlety and a mix of other flavours. Lapsang souchong is found in many Russian Caravan blends. *Spice : Tea such as Indian and Middle Eastern masala chai, flavoured with sweet spices such as ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, cassia, black pepper, clove, anise, fennel, Indian bay leaf and sometimes vanilla, nutmeg and mace. See also Kahwah. *Rum : Jagertee is a tea with rum added. *Roasted grain: Genmaicha, a Japanese tea with roasted rice added to green tea, is favoured by adherents of a macrobiotic diet. Wheat and barley are also used to blend with tea.

John Spencer In April 1993, Craig D. Harvey, a New York State Police trooper was charged with fabricating evidence. Harvey admitted he and another trooper lifted fingerprints from items the suspect, John Spencer, touched while in Troop C headquarters during booking. He attached the fingerprints to evidence cards and later claimed that he had pulled the fingerprints from the scene of the murder. The forged evidence was presented during John Spencer's trial and his subsequent conviction resulted in a term, of 50 years to life in prison, at his sentencing. Shirley Kinge One fabrication involved the 1989 murders of the Harris family of Dryden, New York. In their home, Warren and Dolores Harris, their daughter, Shelby, 15, and their son, Marc, 11, were bound and blindfolded, Shelby was raped and sodomized, all four were shot in the head and the house was doused with gasoline and set on fire. State police investigators say that evidence led them to Michael Kinge, and that officers killed him when he pointed a shotgun at them during the execution of a search warrant. https://cortlandvoice.com/2015/09/21/shirley-kinge-wrongfully-convicted- after-1989-dryden-murders-dies-at-80/ His mother, Shirley Kinge, admitted to using a credit card stolen from the Harris home, which led investigators to consider her a potential accomplice. New York State Police had also previously obtained a sworn statement from a resident on the same road of the Harris home (approximately four miles west from the Harris home and one mile east of the parking lot where the Harris van had been found following the murders). In the sworn statement, the witness stated that \\"on December 23, 1989, at approximately 6:50 a.m., he was exiting his driveway when he saw a slow-moving van approaching his driveway from the east.\\"http://www.courts.state.ny.us/Reporter/3dseries/2007/2007_27561.htm The witness \\"identified the driver of this van as a light-skinned black male wearing a stocking cap, and further stated that he was accompanied by a female passenger, also light-skinned but darker than the driver, who appeared older than the driver. He indicated that his description of the occupants of the van matched the composite sketches of the suspects which had been publicized by the news media.\\" The witness later withdrew his statement. Officers Harding and Lishansky, of Troop C, also claimed that they found fingerprints on gasoline cans found at the Harris home. Kinge was convicted of burglary and arson and received a sentence of 17 to 44 years in prison. She served two and a half years before Harding and Lishansky admitted that the fingerprint evidence had been fabricated by retrieving fingerprints of Ms. Kinge from her job and asserting they found them on the cans. Her conviction was later overturned. After being released, Kinge brought suit against the State of New York, claiming damages of over $500 million.https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/06/nyregion/woman-sues-in-rigging-of- evidence-by-troopers.html The Court of Claims eventually ruled in favor of Kinge on the claims of (1) malicious prosecution and (2) negligent supervision and awarded her $250,000, noting as follows: > ‚Ä≥In sum, the actions of Senior Investigator McElligott, or in this case, an > unjustified and complete lack of supervision and control, allowed > Investigator Harding the time and opportunity to fabricate fingerprint > evidence which ultimately became the only significant evidence placing > claimant at the Harris home.

Harding was interviewed for a job at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He was asked if he was willing to break the law for his country. He answered \\"yes\\", then explained how he worked to convict people he felt sure were guilty by fabricating evidence. He assumed the CIA would be pleased with his answer, but instead they notified the United States Department of Justice. There was a 14-month delay between the discovery of the misconduct and any action taken. Troopers *Craig D.

Punch also does local radio spots in Knoxville. Early life Punch grew up in Newton, North Carolina. He began his broadcasting career when he was selected to join the local radio station staff of Newton-Conover High School. The local radio station, WNNC in Newton, provided free air time to the local high school broadcasting organization with rotational assignments to the aspiring broadcast journalists. Students at the high school auditioned for the much sought after staff positions. Jerry was successful and was selected by fellow students to become a new reporter and, thus, he was permitted to participate in the weekly Saturday morning live broadcasts on WNNC. Punch walked-on to the football team at NC State, serving as backup quarterback under coach Lou Holtz. He graduated magna cum laude at NC State in 1975 with a degree in zoology. He received a medical degree from Wake Forest University School of Medicine in 1979. Punch paid his college and medical school tuition through prize money earned racing at short tracks in North Carolina. Prior to his broadcasting career, Punch worked as an emergency medicine physician. He initially worked at Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1982. He later served as the director of emergency medicine at Bunnell Community Hospital (now known as Florida Hospital Flagler) in Palm Coast, Florida. For a period of time, Punch's medical and broadcasting careers overlapped. Broadcasting career Punch began radio broadcasting for Motor Racing Network (MRN) in 1980. In 1984, he began working for ESPN as a pit reporter for NASCAR races. While working at ESPN, Punch also moonlighted at TBS and SETN doing pit reporting; as he was the first to report on the eventually fatal injuries to driver Terry Schoonover during the 1984 Atlanta Journal 500 for the network's race coverage. Punch also has been pitlane reporter for the Indianapolis 500 from 1989 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2018. He also served as the lead play-by-play voice for ESPN's coverage of the Craftsman Truck Series until the network lost that contract to Speed Channel following the 2002 season. In addition, he called play-by-play for college basketball and football, and has served as a sideline reporter for college football. On October 12, 2006, he was named the lead lap-by-lap commentator for ESPN's coverage of the Sprint Cup Series and the Nationwide Series starting in 2007 along with Rusty Wallace and Andy Petree. Punch and Petree were joined by Dale Jarrett in 2008 and stayed together until the end of the 2009 season; ESPN replaced Punch with Marty Reid for 2010 and returned him to pit road. In 2015, after ESPN lost broadcast rights to NASCAR, Punch returned to his previous role as a sideline reporter for college football games on ESPN, pairing up with Mike Patrick and Ed Cunningham to call selected games on the network. Punch also has been ESPN's expert for discussion of medical issues. He was consulted as a doctor in 1996 to report the condition of Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier, who would go undrafted in the NFL due to a blood clot in his left leg. On April 26, 2017, after 30 years with ESPN, Punch was let go along with 99 other network employees. He continued to be the pit road reporter until the 2017 Chevrolet Dual in Detroit, the final IndyCar race on ESPN's contract for 2017. He would later return for the 2018 IndyCar season to cover the IndyCar Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500 as ABC airs its final year of IndyCar as NBC Sports has acquired the rights beginning in 2019. In 2019, Punch returned to college football coverage with ESPN, serving as a part-time sideline reporter for games.https://506sports.com/forum/index.php?topic=22724.0  Medical role in incidents  In 1988, in two separate incidents, Punch helped with the rescue efforts after the wrecks of Rusty Wallace and Don Marmor. In the case of Wallace's front-stretch crash at Bristol Motor Speedway, Punch happened to be on pit road at the time, and as a result, was the first person on the scene before the rescue crew could be scrambled. Punch's medical training proved pivotal, as Wallace was initially unconscious following the crash. Punch revived Wallace, who was able to start the following night's race with only minor injuries, driving for about half the race before giving his seat up to a relief driver. Wallace later worked with Punch in ESPN's coverage of NASCAR. In 1989 at the Motorcraft Quality Parts 500, Punch was reporting from the pit stall of Richard Petty when a fire broke out, injuring two crew members who Punch proceeded to treat on the spot. Following the incident, ESPN mandated that its pit reporters wear fire-proof suits. Punch is also credited with helping to save Ernie Irvan following a practice crash at Michigan International Speedway in August 1994. Punch also had aided injured pit crew members on pit road in several races in the 1990s. While Punch was addressing a Nashville Superspeedway media luncheon he was interrupted by a loud crash from the back of the room. Punch immediately rushed from the podium to the back of the room where Jenny Gill (daughter of singer-musician, Vince Gill), a Nashville Superspeedway intern, had fainted. Punch helped revive her, and she was taken to a local care center for observation and soon recovered, according to Sean Dozier, the Superspeedway's public relations director. Punch returned to the podium and resumed his speech. Days of Thunder Punch also appeared as himself as an ESPN commentator, in the 1990 film Days of Thunder, which starred Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall. Punch also acted as a technical advisor in the development of the movie.

He began his career in film in the mid 1970s, and wrote extensively for television films including Playing for Time written by Arthur Miller starring Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Alexander, and some independent cinema releases, until director James Cameron hired him to score the science fiction film The Terminator in 1984, setting the wheels in motion for a successful career. Since then, Fiedel has scored many popular and successful movies, including Fright Night (1985) and its sequel Fright Night Part 2 (1988), The Big Easy (1987), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), The Accused (1988), Blue Steel (1990), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Blink (1994), and True Lies (1994). He also composed the Lightstorm Entertainment logo jingle.http://www.classicthemes.com/studioLogos.shtml In recent years, Fiedel moved on to other creative areas, writing original musicals, and designing and building a surf resort in La Saladita, Mexico. His last major theatrical score was in 1995, and although he enjoyed a brief period of renewed interest following the release of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003, when Marco Beltrami wrote an orchestral arrangement of his theme, he shows no sign of returning to the film music field. He recently released an audio version of his original musical Full Circle. Family Ann Dusenberry in 1976 Fiedel has been married to actress Ann Dusenberry since 1993; the couple have two daughters named Alixandra and Zoe; they live in Santa Barbara, California.

McFarlan (1822-1909). History J. B. McFarlan's grandson, Alfred Harry McFarlan (1881-1937) conceived the idea for the McFarlan motor car and ran the McFarlan Motor Corporation throughout its nineteen years. The first model year was 1910 and two of the company's cars were entered in events at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway that year. McFarlans driven by Mel Marquette were also entered in first two Indianapolis 500 races (1911 and 1912) in which they finished 25th and 19th, respectively. The McFarlan was a luxury automobile owned by celebrities of the day such as Wallace Reid, William Desmond Taylor, Fatty Arbuckle, Paul Whiteman, Jack Dempsey and Virginia governor E. Lee Trinkle. Al Capone bought a McFarlan for his wife, Mae, in 1924 and bought a second one in 1926. Enormous models of the 1920s gave the company the reputation as being the \\"American Rolls Royce.\\" 1928 was the final model year and the company went into bankruptcy that year. In 1967, a book, What Was the McFarlan? was privately published in a limited edition of 1,000 and is the definitive history of the McFarlan Motor Corporation. Authors Keith Marvin and Al Arnheim were McFarlan enthusiasts and avid automobile historians. The book identified nineteen extant McFarlans. Today, a few McFarlans are owned in private collections and important automobile museums, including the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum, the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada and the Nethercutt Collection in California.

Today the abbey church and its estate cover a site of approximately 300 hectares which is administered by the Klosterkammer Hannover, a body that operates under the auspices of the to look after reassigned or disused ecclesiastical buildings and other heritage properties in the region. The legal owner of the Bursfelde Monastery Complex (\\"Zentrums Kloster Bursfelde\\") is the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover. History The abbey was founded in 1093 by Count Heinrich the Fat of Northeim so that the members of noble families from the area might be buried in a place with monks permanently in attendance. Archbishop Ruthard of Mainz participated in the foundation. The first monks came from Corvey Abbey: a close association between the two foundations would endure. In 1102 the founder, who had been killed by invading Frisians, was himself buried in the abbey church. The late eleventh century was a period of monastic and ecclesiastical reform, and from the outset Bursfelde was influenced by the new ideas coming out of Cluny and Hirsau. Although one motive for the abbey's foundation was clearly that the souls of the faithful departed kinsfolk of the founder might be properly prayed for, the founder's dynastic ambitions and the pressures of the church reform movement also played their part.Hans-Walter Krumwiede: Die Geschichte des Klosters Bursfelde. In: Lothar Perlitt (producer-editor): Kloster Bursfelde. 6th edition, G√∂ttingen 1996, pp. 9-23 Emperor Henry IV granted Bursfelde numerous privileges and immunities. Following the Benedictine tradition, Almeric, the first abbot, opened a school, which soon became famous. Under the next four abbots its fame continued to increase. The abbey complex was created on the Miminde estate, which the founder had inherited from Albert von Gieselwerder. The site lay at the confluence of the Rivers Nieme and Weser. Henry's father, Otto of Nordheim, had previously erected the a couple of kilometers upriver, which provided a measure of protection. In line with the ideals of the still influential monastic reform movement, and with the backing of Archbishop Ruthard of Mainz it was established that abbots should be freely elected. The same level of trust did not extend to the abbey's more temporal interests however: bailiffs were to be appointed in perpetuity by the . There was to be no political autonomy, given the continuing legal and military dependence channeled through the bailiffs. The granting of market and currency rights to the monastery nevertheless appears to have been part of the founder's strategy for building up the territorial power of the Northeim family in the area. It would be wrong to overstate the economic importance of the foundation. The emphasis in the Benedictine monastery was less on craftwork or agriculture, and more on scientific research and teaching. In 1101 Henry was killed in Frisia. His body was returned to Bursfelde and buried on 10 April 1101 in the foundations of what later became the abbey's \\"west church\\" (\\"Westkirche\\"). Subsequently, in 1115, his widow, the three-times- married Gertrude of Brunswick, founded the at Braunschweig, which was subordinated to the Abbot of Bursfelde. Links between the two foundations would remain close. A further significant development came in 1135 when the founder's daughter, Richenza (whose husband Lothar of Supplingenburg, had become Holy Roman Emperor in 1133) arranged for the construction of the abbey's great \\"East Choir\\" (\\"Ost-Chor\\"). The Northeims were determined to stamp their mark on Bursfelde. In 1144 Bursfelde Abbey passed to the control of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony (1139) and later also of Bavaria (1156), following the death of Siegfried IV, a grandson of Otto of Nordheim who had died without male issue. Henry the Lion confirmed the rights of the Abbey, following the presentation of a falsified foundation record. The absence of male heirs in the meant that the County of Northeim, including Bursfelde Abbey, now passed to the Guelfs. Henry the Lion reduced his rights over the abbey to rights of patronage and jurisdiction. By this time the diminishing impact of the Benedictine reform movement in general and of its inmpct at Bursfelde Abbey in particular meant that control over Bursfelde was of reduced importance in terms of the political power politics of the great families in the region. After the ending of the Investiture Controversy the Benedictine reform movement had rapidly lost impetus. During the same period the Cistercian monks had gained in kudos with an ascetic lifestyle which left the Benedictines appearing relatively worldly. Later on rivalries were complicated intensified by the increased prominence of the Mendicant orders. Nevertheless, even when Bursfelde features less prominently in the records by the end of the twelfth century, by around 1200 it had major land holdings, with fourteen farming estates, although these were widely dispersed, with holdings as far to the south as Erfurt and as far to the west as Osnabr√ºck. But the economic focus remained on the region more immediately surrounding Bursfelde. Management of the farms was in most cases contracted out, but the main estate at Bursfelde was directly managed. In 1331, under abbot Henry Lasar, monastic discipline began to relax, the school was neglected and the valuable possessions dissipated. From 1331 to 1424 no records of the abbey were kept. When in 1424 the aged Albert of Bodenstein became abbot, both church and school had fallen almost into ruins, and the monastery itself was in a dilapidated condition, housing a single old monk. Albert was too old to undertake the gigantic task of restoring Bursfelde and resigned the abbacy in 1430. During the 15th century a strong current of monastic and ecclesiastical reform made itself felt throughout the Roman Catholic world. One of the first Benedictine reformers was John Dederoth of Northeim. After carrying out notable reforms at Clus Abbey, where he had been abbot since 1430, Dederoth was persuaded by Duke Otto of Brunswick in 1433 to undertake the reform of Bursfelde. Obtaining four exemplary religious from the monastery of St. Matthias' Abbey, Trier, he assigned two of them to the monastery at Clus, to maintain his reformed discipline there, while the other two accompanied him to Bursfelde. As abbot of Clus, he was able to recruit from that community for Bursfelde. Dederoth succeeded beyond expectations in the restoration of Bursfelde and began the reform of Reinhausen Abbey, near G√∂ttingen, but died on 6 February 1439, before his efforts in that quarter had borne fruit. Bursfelde Congregation :See main article Bursfelde Congregation Dederoth's successor, John of Hagen, obtained permission in 1445 from the Council of Basle to restore the Divine Office to the original form of the old Benedictine breviary and to introduce liturgical and disciplinary uniformity in the monasteries that followed the reform of Bursfelde. On 11 March 1446 the Cardinal Legate Louis d'Allemand approved the Bursfelde Union or Congregation, which then consisted of six abbeys: Bursfelde itself, Clus, Reinhausen, Cismar in Schleswig-Holstein, St. Jacob near Mainz, and Huysburg near Magdeburg. On 6 March 1458, Pope Pius II approved the statutes of the congregation. The Bursfelde Congregation was a highly beneficial reforming influence on the spiritual life of the time in the Benedictine monasteries of Germany during the second half of the fifteenth, and the first half of the sixteenth, century. At the death of Abbot John of Hagen thirty-six monasteries had already joined the Bursfelde Congregation, and just before the Reformation, at least 136 abbeys, scattered through all parts of Germany, belonged to it. The efficacy of the Congregation was severely curtailed by the Reformation, during which many of its member houses were dissolved, but continued in a restricted form until the secularisations of the late 18th and early 19th centuries dissolved the surviving religious houses. Reformation and dissolution In 1579, Andrew L√ºderitz, the last abbot of Bursfelde, was driven out by the Lutheran Duke Julius of Brunswick, and Bursfelde ceased to be a Catholic monastery. The possessions of the abbey were confiscated, and the abbot was replaced by a Lutheran. A Protestant convent was accommodated here until well into the 17th century, when the estates were leased out to tenants. A few Catholic monks returned for a time during the Thirty Years' War. The title of (Protestant) abbot has been bestowed since 1828 on the Senior Fellow of the Theological Faculty at the University of G√∂ttingen. The surviving abbey buildings are still used for theological training and conferences. The legal basis for the meeting house is the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover. The spiritual center is incorporated into the House of Church Offices of the Church of Hanover. It is owned by the Hanover Chamber monaste. References * Heutger, Nicolaus, 1975.

It was built in 1970 at a cost of $9 million. The school had 1,236 students enrolled and a student/teacher ratio of 17:1 in the 2014‚Äì2015 school year. The school is built on an old landfill and is situated next to Clay Pit Pond. The town's high school used to be located on Orchard Street, but was badly damaged by fire in 1967. A new school was eventually built at the current location on 221 Concord Avenue in Belmont, MA.http://www.belmont.k12.ma.us/bhs/directions/ The previous high school re- opened as the Roger Wellington elementary school in and was entirely demolished in February‚ÄìMarch 2010 for reconstruction. Belmont High is ranked #267 in the National Rankings and #7 in Massachusetts by USNews and also earned a gold medal. Administration and faculty The school administration consists of the principal, Mr. Isaac Taylor; three assistant principals, Allie Ruane, Michael Bruno, and Daniel O'Brien; and a support assistant principal, Tom Brow. In recent years, the school administration has experienced frequent changes. In June 2004, the school's long-time principal, Foster Wright, retired. Jonathan Landman was hired to replace him, but the school department did not renew Landman's contract for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year. Michael Harvey, who had been among the candidates for principal in 2004, was selected as an \\"interim principal\\" for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year, and, on January 10, 2007, was approved by the town as principal. He had been the director of social studies during the previous school year. In addition, one of the school's two assistant principals has left the system in June 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2011. In 2012, when Harvey left to become superintendent of the Hamilton-Wenham schools, former-assistant-principal Daniel Richards took his place. Richards had spent his last year as the Principal of Melrose High and had been replaced by David Smokler. When Richards returned, Smokler kept his position temporarily before being permanently replaced by the Head of Guidance, Jim Brown. The school has eight academic departments: Mathematics, English, Foreign Language, Social Studies, Science, Fine and Performing Arts, and Athletics. Each department consists of a department head, along with the teachers of the courses the department offers. The Guidance Department is responsible for the mental well-being of students, schedule composition, and college planning. Each student is assigned to a guidance counselor. School hours and schedule School is in session each day between 8:00am and 2:25pm except for Wednesdays, which conclude at 1:30pm. Belmont High School operates on a non-traditional module-based schedule. There are 15 modules (\\"mods\\") each day, each of which is approximately 25 minutes long. There are also blocks of \\"pass time\\" between most mods, which are usually 3 minutes in length, and are meant to give students time to walk from one class to another. Each mod is named with a letter and a number. The letter corresponds the time of the mod (A is the earliest and spans 7:35am ‚Äì 7:59am. O is the latest, and spans 2:00pm ‚Äì 2:25pm). The number corresponds to the day, with Monday being 1 and Friday being 5. Thus, for example, C3 is the time period 8:27am ‚Äì 8:52am on Wednesdays. Most classes meet four times per week for three 2-mod sessions (a \\"double\\") and one 3-mod session (a \\"triple\\"). The day that the class does not meet is called a \\"drop\\". On Wednesdays, school is dismissed at 1:30pm for most students, meaning that only 13 mods are held, with the last two mods of the day being \\"free\\" for teacher meetings. Additionally, all classes are shortened by a few minutes to compensate for the fact that the mod usually ends at 1:33pm, not 1:30pm. As a result of this mod schedule, each student's schedule is unique to the classes he or she is taking. Students who do not have a class assigned during a mod are \\"free\\". Seniors are permitted, by school policy, to leave campus during this time if they have met the required criteria for the privilege. Juniors also have access to this policy. While no classes are scheduled for only one mod, it is possible to have only one mod free. A student who takes six classes will have 20 free mods per week, while those who take Wellness I or Positive Decision Making will have 16 free mods per week. A student's schedule is based on a master schedule, which states when certain mods have triples, drops, etc. As a result, it is fairly easy to describe one's schedule using a list of variations from the master schedule. Courses and graduation requirements The school requires that all students complete: * 4 years of English * 4 years of Mathematics * 4 years of Science * 3 years of Social Studies * 2 years of Foreign Language * 1 year of Fine and Performing Arts * 4 years of Physical Education and Health A number of Advanced Placement (AP), or college-level class are offered to prepare the students for the AP exams in May. Based on the results of its AP exams, Belmont High School is, as of December 2008, on the U.S. News & World Report list of the top 100 high schools in the United States. It occupies the lofty #100 position on that list, and holds the second-highest ranking of any Massachusetts school on the list, behind the Boston Latin School, the oldest public school in the nation, and the highest ranking of any Massachusetts school that does not require an entrance exam. English As of 2007-08, all students are required to take an English course each year. Based on grade, the student may take English 9, English 10, English 11, and either English 12 or AP English Literature. English 9-12 are offered at college preparatory (CP) or honors (H) levels. In the past, Belmont High School has, instead of English 12H, offered two humanities classes in place of English 12 and other English electives, although these are no longer offered. Social Studies All students are required to take World History, Modern World History, and American Studies, all of which are offered at either a college preparatory (CP) or honors (H) level. Students can replace Modern World History with AP European History, and can also replace American Studies with AP United States History.

In addition, the Social Studies department also offers AP Psychology, which can be supplemented by an Honors- level Neurobiology elective. Mathematics All students are required to take 4 math courses. Most students take, in order, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre- calculus, and Calculus, though some students select other options, including: * Some take Algebra I freshman year, but most take Geometry during their first year. Those who choose the former usually end with Pre-calculus. * Calculus during the junior year of high school, and participating in either an independent study (typically a course at the Harvard Extension School) during their senior year. * Substituting either Calculus or Pre-calculus with Math Big Decision. In addition, the Mathematics Department also offers several electives, such as AP Stats, which can be taken instead of an independent study for a student who took Calculus their junior year. Geometry, Algebra II, and Pre-calculus are offered at either a college preparatory (CP) or honors (H) level. Algebra I and all electives are only offered as CP classes. Calculus is offered at three levels: one H class and two classes to prepare students for either the AP Calculus AB exam or the AP Calculus BC exam. Science All students are required to take, in order, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, all of which are offered as CP and honors courses, and, in the case of Biology, AP in the first year. In addition, students must take at least one elective. Potential electives include AP Chemistry, AP Biology, AP Physics 1, Astronomy, Design and Technology, and AP Psychology / Neurobiology. Foreign Language Two years of foreign language are required, though many students opt to take more. Students may take courses in Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, French, or Latin. Independent studies may also be offered in German. Exchange programs exist to Argentina, France, and Italy. Fine and Performing Arts Belmont High School offers many fine and performing arts courses. This includes many choirs, the wind ensemble, the symphonic band, string orchestra, the chamber orchestra, the jazz band, and the marching band. Many of the members of these ensembles are nationally recognized musicians, and the ensembles themselves have won extensive state and country-wide competitions. It is known as one of the top 100 public school music programs in the country. It offers class in theater including Acting and Technical Theater, and has a strong theatre program in the form of an after school extra-curricular organization known as the Performing Arts Company (PAC). In addition, a vigorous AP Art program gives student artists an opportunity to develop their talents and study new techniques. Fine art courses include Drawing and Painting, 3D Art, Sculpture, Ceramics, Photo, and Ceramics. Physical Education All students are required to take the half-year, one- semester Wellness I during their freshman year, which is both a traditional PE class and a health/sex-ed class (parents can exclude their children from the sex-ed classes if they so choose). Additionally, students must take Positive Decision Making during their junior year, which is also a one semester class. During their remaining years at school, students are required to fulfill two semesters of PE, which they can obtain either by playing a school-offered sport, joining certain clubs, taking Wellness II, or doing PE outside of school. All non-school-offered PE activities require a \\"contract\\" with the Athletics Department. School DemographicsExtracurricular activities and sports=Sports Belmont High School is part of the Middlesex League and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association. The school colors are maroon and blue. The school mascot is the Marauder, which is a pirate. Belmont High Girls Rugby won the first-ever state championship in the sport defeating Algonquin Regional High School, 17-14, on June 10, 2017. It is also the first time in the US a state interscholastic body sponsored a rugby title. The high school's athletic department offers 29 sports with 61 levels of competition: *Fall sports ** Cheerleading (V, JV) ** Cross country - boys, girls (V, JV) ** Field hockey (V, JV, F) ** Football (V, JV, F) ** Golf (V) ** Soccer‚Äîboys, girls (V, JV, F) ** Swimming‚Äîgirls (V, JV) ** Volleyball‚Äîgirls (V, JV, F) *Winter sports ** Basketball - boys, girls (V, JV, F) ** Ice hockey - boys, girls (V, JV) ** Skiing - boys, girls (V, JV) ** Swimming - boys (V, JV) ** Indoor track - boys, girls (V, JV) ** Wrestling (V, JV) ** Cheerleading (V) *Spring sports ** Baseball (V, JV, F) ** Lacrosse - boys, girls (V, JV) ** Rugby - boys, girls (V, JV) ** Softball (V, JV, F) ** Spring track - boys, girls (V, JV) ** Tennis - boys, girls (V, JV) Clubs The clubs range from various science clubs to theatrical organizations and civil rights groups, as well as various hobby enthusiasts . The majority of students participate in at least one or more clubs throughout the school year, as there are many types of clubs that appeal to different preferences. For example, some sports clubs include soccer club, strength training club, and ultimate frisbee team while other clubs are more academically-oriented, such as Model UN, math team, science team, Latin club, computer science club, and debate team. Clubs are usually started (or at least led) by students, with a staff member serving as an adviser. Students also do very well in science, with the Science Olympiad ranked as one of the top in the state. Notably, Alek Westover placed 7th place in the 2020 Regeneron Science Talent Search. Andrew Xu was also named a STS Scholar. In the spring of 2011, the Belmont Rugby Football Club (BRFC) won the Division 2 Massachusetts High School Rugby State championship, and won the Div. 1 championship in 2013. The team participated in the championship game for three consecutive years (2013-2015).

College career DeLawrence Grant was a defensive end for Oregon State University. Professional career Grant was selected by the Raiders in the third round of the 2001 NFL Draft and has played five years for them. Grant began his career as a defensive end before being converted to linebacker. He played sparingly as a rookie in 2001, before starting at left end for most of the Raiders' Super Bowl season in 2002. That season Delawrence was ranked top 10. That offseason, he was released by the Raiders for salary cap reasons, but was later re-signed. Due to an injury, he played only half the season in 2005, missing most of the middle portion. One of the stranger aspects of Grant's star-crossed Raiders career is his continual switch in uniform number. He started out as No. 95, then switched to No. 99 when a more experienced player, Sam Adams, was signed and was issued the jersey. He then switched to No. 59 (the reverse of his prior No. 95) after moving to linebacker, since numbers in the 50s were thought of as linebackers' numbers.

J. Weberman, is an American writer, political activist, gadfly, and popularizer of the terms \\"garbology\\" and \\"Dylanology\\". He is best known for his controversial opinions on, and personal interactions with, the musician Bob Dylan. Together with New York folk singer David Peel, Weberman founded the Rock Liberation Front in 1971 with the aim of \\"liberating\\" artists from bourgeois tendencies and ensuring that rock musicians continued to engage with and represent the counterculture. Early life Weberman was born to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York in 1945. As a boy, he served as president of a local fan club dedicated to the professional wrestler Haystack Calhoun. He has recalled that his father, who was strict in his observance of their faith, regularly inspected the household garbage to ensure that Weberman's mother had not bought non-kosher food. During the early 1960s, Weberman attended Michigan State University. While there, in 1964, he was convicted for selling marijuana and briefly served time in jail before being released on parole. He then returned to New York and worked as an interviewer for the Lawrence Employment Agency while continuing his studies, at night school, at City College of New York. Bob Dylan Weberman has written on the life and works of Bob Dylan, including a pamphlet titled Dylanology in 1969 and creating a word concordance of Dylan's lyrics. He also wrote the Dylan to English Dictionary, published in 2005. One of Weberman's theories on Dylan's songwriting is that some of Dylan's songs are actually about, or addressed to, Weberman himself. Authors Bob Spitz and Jim Curtis have each rejected, and ridiculed, Weberman's interpretations of Dylan's work. In 1969, Weberman founded the \\"Dylan Liberation Front\\" with associates such as street musician David Peel, aiming \\"to help save Bob Dylan from himself\\". Weberman was convinced that, from Dylan's docile, smiling visage on the cover of his 1969 album Nashville Skyline, the singer was hiding from his social conscience and ignoring his responsibilities as a political spokesman for the counterculture. Once Dylan had moved back to Greenwich Village from Upstate New York in 1970, Weberman took to rifling through his garbage. That same year, Weberman began lecturing in Dylanology at the left-wing Alternate University of New York. At this time, the Liberation Front lamented that Dylan had become a \\"reactionary force in rock\\", a view that was echoed among the radical left. Rolling Stone magazine called Weberman \\"the king of all Dylan nuts\\";\\"Rock and Roll Daily\\", Rolling Stone, June 11, 2007 he has also been described as obsessively stalking Dylan. In late summer 1971, Dylan ‚Äì annoyed that Weberman had reneged on their agreement that he would no longer dig through his garbage ‚Äì assaulted Weberman on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan.The Answers My Friend, Are Written in This Book By COLIN MOYNIHAN Published: January 16, 2006 In a 1997 article, Rolling Stone reported that Weberman, \\"a man that terrorized Bob Dylan during the '60s\\", had now \\"returned to hassle his son\\", Jakob Dylan. Weberman claimed that the younger Dylan was a heroin addict.\\"Man no fan of Dylan family\\", Rolling Stone, July 4, 1997 In 1977, Weberman's telephone conversations with Dylan from the early 1970s were released on the Folkways Records album Bob Dylan vs A.J. Weberman ‚Äì The Historic Confrontation. Writing in 2014 about the phenomenon of \\"Bob Dylan obsessives\\", John Dickerson of Slate described Weberman as \\"The most famous of the Dylanologists\\". In December 2016, after Dylan received the Nobel Prize in Literature, Weberman released a video on YouTube in which he claimed credit for Dylan's achievement. Journalist John Semley, writing for Salon, views Weberman's claim as far-fetched yet also identifies \\"a scrap of truth in it\\". He recognises the garbologist as furthering a \\"philosophical and anthropological tradition\\" observed by French poet Charles Baudelaire, in the latter's celebration of the city chiffonier (or rag-picker), and practiced in the work of German philosopher Walter Benjamin. Semley concludes: \\"Maybe an artist of Bob Dylan's magnitude requires a worthy b√™te noire like Alan Weberman, a guy who's equal parts pariah, arch enemy, early model internet troll, modern-day chiffonnier; a manic, moonstruck, single-minded goon who pours heart, soul, and sanity into his stupendous schemes.\\" Rock Liberation Front Weberman and the Dylan Liberation Front ceased their scrutiny of Dylan, temporarily, after he performed at George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows at Madison Square Garden on 1 August 1971. Weberman was satisfied with Dylan's reversion to his 1960s protest singer persona and his scruffy attire at the concerts. Together with Peel, he formed the Rock Liberation Front (RLF) to \\"establish a relationship of understanding and participation in the World of Rock\\", which had \\"been getting ripped off too long\\". They first targeted Paul McCartney, whose recent music showed he was \\"just a businessman\\" and \\"a good example of the capitalist, non-involved egotistical rock star\\", according to Weberman. The RLF therefore held a mock funeral for McCartney, on 26 August, outside the Park Avenue home of his lawyer and father-in-law, Lee Eastman. Reporting on the event a week later in The Village Voice, Blair Sabol opined that Weberman's strategy was becoming overfamiliar: \\"Being the foremost Dylanologist, or garbageologist, was brilliant for last year's routine, but revamping it for Paul McCartney as this year's 'capitalist pig' campaign is like giving an encore after the audience has gone home.\\" The RLF also protested against Led Zeppelin for demanding $75,000 per concert performance. Weberman's idealism resonated with John Lennon, who had recently moved to Greenwich Village with his artist wife, Yoko Ono, and embarked on a radical left agenda under the guidance of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon espoused Weberman's principles in his interactions with the music press, stating that he was dedicated to making politically motivated music without a thought for commercial gain. In early December, the RLF demonstrated outside Capitol Records, protesting the company's delay in releasing the live album from the Concert for Bangladesh after Harrison had accused them of refusing to distribute the record at cost price. During the protest, Weberman announced that Lennon and Ono had joined the Liberation Front, which he defined as \\"a group dedicated to exposing hip capitalist counterculture ripoffs and politicizing rock music and rock artists\\". Yoko Ono and John Lennon performing at the John Sinclair Freedom Rally in December 1971 Through Lennon, Rubin came to be involved with the RLF, and soon sidelined Weberman. In his speech at the freedom rally for the imprisoned poet and activist John Sinclair, on 10 December 1971, where Lennon, Ono and Peel were among the performers, Rubin described the event as \\"the first act of the Rock Liberation Front\\". Lennon, Ono and Rubin also planned a US tour that would use their political message to unite the nation's young voters and thwart President Nixon's campaign for re- election in 1972. Lennon and Rubin were intent on enlisting Dylan for the tour and so issued an open letter on behalf of the RLF, demanding that Weberman publicly apologise to Dylan for the print and radio campaign he had waged against the singer and for describing him as a junkie. Published in The Village Voice, the letter also stated that all those in the movement should \\"[save] our anger for the true enemy, whose ignorance and greed destroys our planet\\", and led to the RLF becoming an organisation of interest to the FBI. Author Peter Doggett likens this demand to a forced confession in \\"Stalin's Russia\\", since Rubin had openly supported the underground publications that ran Weberman's stories, and Weberman had been among the first to accept Dylan's post-Bangladesh single, \\"George Jackson\\", as a worthy return to the protest style. Weberman nevertheless issued an apology \\"for past untrue statements and also the harassment of Bob Dylan and his family\\", and signed it: \\"A.J. Weberman, Minister of Defence, Rock Liberation Front\\". New York poet and activist Allen Ginsberg among the protestors at the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Weberman regained his leadership of the RLF in February 1972, when the group \\"liberated\\" the offices of Lennon and Harrison's business manager, Allen Klein, at 1700 Broadway. The event was a press conference in which Klein attempted to respond to allegations made in New York magazine, and partly supported in Rolling Stone, that he had pocketed funds intended for the Bangladeshi refugees from the sale of the Concert for Bangladesh album. Chanting \\"You'll wonder where the money went, when Klein runs a charity event\\", the protestors disrupted the press conference and gained further exposure for Klein's alleged fraud in Variety, Rolling Stone and The Village Voice. Surprisingly for Weberman, this resulted in an invitation from Lennon and Ono for him to visit them at their Bank Street apartment, where the couple confided that Klein was \\"ripping us off too\\". According to Weberman, he introduced Lennon to a group of sympathisers and financiers for the IRA, to whom Lennon made a generous financial contribution. Lennon's direct role in political activism soon waned, although he continued to finance activities by Weberman and Peel. The latter recorded an album, The Pope Smokes Dope, which was produced by Lennon and Ono, and released on Apple Records in April 1972. Lennon also donated $50,000 to pay for demonstrators' travel expenses to Miami, Florida, where Weberman helped to stage a mass protest against Nixon at the Republican National Convention in August. Coup D'Etat In America: The CIA and the Assassination of JFK In 1975, Weberman wrote Coup D'Etat In America: The CIA and the Assassination of JFK with Michael Canfield. According to one account, \\"Canfield and Weberman propose a basic theory on the assassination, revolving around the CIA and the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and then use the bulk of the book to document and substantiate their allegations.\\" According to Weberman and Canfield, the CIA planned the assassination of Kennedy because he had agreed to stop the Cuban exiles' anti- Castro operations. Among the book's contentions are that Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy and that two of the \\"three tramps\\" photographed by several Dallas-area newspapers under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination Kennedy were Watergate burglars E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis. Coup D'Etat In America was reported to influence United States House of Representatives member Henry B. Gonzalez to initiate a resolution that would result in the formation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. A reviewer for The Harvard Crimson wrote: \\"Despite its lapses into obsessive speculations about connections between irrelevant figures and dubious arguments by analogy of modus operandi, Coup d'Etat is a chillingly convincing book.\\" Coup d'Etat in America reiterated Tad Szulc's allegation that Hunt was the acting chief of the CIA station in Mexico City in 1963 while Lee Harvey Oswald was there. In July 1976, Hunt filed a $2.5 million libel suit against Weberman and Canfield, as well as the book's publishers and editor. Other activities In 2002, Weberman, along with the Jewish Defense Organization, and JDO chief Mordechai Levy, were successfully sued for libel in Brooklyn, New York. The jury stated that Weberman was responsible for $300,000 of the $850,000 judgement. In 2005, Weberman worked with Yippies including Dana Beal and Pie Man Aron Kay to turn the long-time Yippie headquarters at 9 Bleecker Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side into a counterculture museum. As of February 2006, renovation of the building was partially completed, and a charter from the New York State Board of Regents was granted. The museum, which Weberman likened to a \\"Hard Rock Cafe for Yippies\\", would house the remains of Jerry Rubin's roadkill (Rubin was killed by a car) and Abbie Hoffman's trash. In 2006, Weberman, along with some of his former students, appeared in a documentary film about his exploits as a Dylanologist, titled The Ballad of AJ Weberman. The film includes a performance by Peel and Weberman of \\"The Ballad of A. J. Weberman\\", a tribute song that Peel recorded for his 1974 album Santa Claus Rooftop Junkie.

The head of a red snapper is stewed in a Kerala- style curry with assorted vegetables such as okra and eggplants. It is usually served with either rice or bread, or as a shared dish. Description It is believed that fish head curry was invented when chef M.J. Gomez from Kerala, India adopted the dish to bring South Indian cuisine to diners in Singapore. Although fish head was not widely served in India, Chinese customers considered it to be a special delicacy, so M.J. had the idea of cooking the fish in curry instead. Today, Indian, Malay, Chinese, and Peranakan restaurants all serve variations of this dish. Fish head curry has become a popular dish among Singaporeans and tourists alike. Costing between $10 and $20, it is generally not considered cheap hawker fare. It typically comes served in a clay pot, and is often sold at hawker centers and neighbourhood food stalls. Preparation Tamarind (asam) juice is frequently added to the gravy to give the dish a sweet-sour flavor (see asam fish). This variety of fish head curry also has a thinner, orange gravy.

The International Board meets 3 times per year to define FIDH‚Äôs political and strategic orientations and to draw up and approve the budget. The Executive Board is composed of the President, the Treasurer and the 5 Secretaries General, and is responsible for the management of FIDH on a daily basis. This body meets once per month to take decisions on current concerns and requests submitted by member organizations. The two Boards call on the expertise of other collaborators in FIDH‚Äôs activities, including the permanent delegates to intergovernmental organizations and the mission delegates. The team of mission delegates gathers together several hundred individuals from all regions. The International Secretariat is based in Paris, with delegations to the United Nations in Geneva and New York City, to the European Union in Brussels, to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, to the African Union in Nairobi and to the Asean in Bangkok. It also has regional offices in Abidjan, Bamako, Cairo, Conakry and Tunis. It implements decisions taken by the International and Executive Boards and ensures regular support to member organizations. The Secretariat employs 45 permanent staff, assisted by interns and volunteers.

Freundel was regarded as \\"a brilliant scholar,\\" a \\"profound\\" orator and an authority in several areas of halakha (Jewish law), including eruvim, which he assisted in constructing in a number of cities, including Washington. Freundel's career came to a sudden end in October 2014 when he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbiahttp://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1314637/templewarrant.pdf and charged with committing voyeurism of several women in a mikveh (Jewish ritual bath). Kesher Israel immediately suspended him without pay and later notified the congregants that he had been fired. Similarly, he was also suspended from membership in the Vaadhttp://www.capitolk.org/ and the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), the main professional association for Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States. He also was suspended from his multiple academic positions. He was assistant professor of rabbinics at Baltimore Hebrew University, where he was the rabbinic studies graduate program adviser, associate professor at Towson University and adjunct lecturer at the Georgetown University Law Center. Towson University immediately opened its own administrative review of Freundel's conduct with students, while Georgetown University began its own investigation as well. Freundel ultimately pleaded guilty to 52 counts of voyeurism and was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and fined $13,000. On August 28, 2018, the $100 million class action lawsuit which had been brought on behalf of the victims against Freundel and the organizations he was associated with was dropped in lieu of a settlement of $14.25 million, to be paid by the insurance of the parties named in the suit. He was expected to be released on August 21, 2020, but was released early on April 1, 2020 due to COVID-19. Education Freundel earned a Bachelor of Science at Yeshiva College with a double major in chemistry and physics, along with a concurrent B.S. from the Erna Michael College of Hebraic Studies. He received a Master's degree in Talmudic studies from the Bernard Revel Graduate School and his semikhah (rabbinic ordination) from Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), part of Yeshiva University.

As a writer and lecturer, Freundel addressed topics ranging from environmentalism to Jewish medical ethics. He had served as a visiting scholar at Princeton, Yale and Cornell and guest lecturer at Columbia and the University of Chicago. Due to his congregation's proximity to Georgetown University, he lectured at that institution with particular frequency. Similarly, his proximity to Capitol Hill had facilitated his participation in governmental affairs as a consultant and commentator. Freundel served as consultant to the Ethics Review Board of the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health and consultant to the United States Presidential Commission on Cloning (May 1997). In the past, he had served as pre-rabbinics advisor and assistant director of synagogue services at Yeshiva University (August 1986 - June 1989), as a member of Yeshiva University's Rabbinic Alumni Association Executive Committee, and as a vice-president of the RCA, whose conversion committee he headed. Freundel appeared on the episode of Da Ali G Show entitled \\"War.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35rHhxZKGes Voyeurism charges and conviction=Arrest, arraignment and investigation On October 14, 2014 police took Freundel from his synagogue-owned residence in handcuffs and, pursuant to a search warrant,http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1314635/homesearchwarrant.pdf removed computers and other items from the premises. One day later, Freundel was arraigned and charged with six counts of voyeurism, a misdemeanor, for allegedly filming women while they were undressing before immersing themselves in the National Capital Mikvah, an independent facility that Freundel was instrumental in founding in 2005.https://cbsbaltimore.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/criminal-complaint.pdf Assistant U.S. Attorney Sharon Marcus Kurn told the judge that Freundel \\"violated the laws up in the heavens and down,\\" but he pleaded not guilty to these initial charges and was released on his own recognizance under condition that he stay away from and have no contact with the synagogue and the mikvah,http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/programs/vw/pdf/bfreundel_docs/release_order_stay_away.pdf which are located in adjacent buildings. The police acted after the National Capital Mikvah's lay leadership handed them a suspicious clock radio the rabbi had placed in the shower room at the mikvah, a ritual bath that is used as part of the conversion ritual, by married Orthodox women following menstruation and childbirth and by some Orthodox men before the onset of the Sabbath and major Jewish holidays. \\"Upon receiving information regarding potentially inappropriate activity, the Board of Directors quickly alerted the appropriate officials,\\" it noted in a statement published upon Freundel's arrest and suspension. \\"Throughout the investigation, we cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so.\\" A witness told the police that Freundel was observed placing the clock radio in the mikvah shower room and, when he was discovered doing so, he claimed that he was repairing the ventilation. A police inspection of the clock radio found that it contained a video camera whose memory revealed surreptitious recordings of six different women changing ‚Äî and moving images of Freundel himself setting up the camera. Detectives said that as many as 200 women could have been recorded without their knowledge. A forensic examination determined that several media storage devices found in Freundel's home contained copies of videos backed up from the camera's memory card. Superior Court of the District of Columbia According to a search warrant,http://images.shulcloud.com/440/uploads/PostArrestResources/towson- all.pdf Freundel may not only have set up spying and recording devices at his synagogue and at the mikvah, but also at Towson University. A search of Freundel's Towson office revealed several small cameras hidden in everyday items, multiple computer storage devices, and a list of handwritten names.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/police-find-micro-cameras-in- search-of-rabbis-towson-university- office/2014/10/24/2c7d0496-5b02-11e4-8264-deed989ae9a2_story.html On November 12, district prosecutors told a D.C. Superior Court judge they needed more time to investigate and determine if there were additional victims. The court was informed that a web site was being created in order to reach other victims. On January 16, 2015, the prosecution requested another one-month delay to complete their review of all the video evidence obtained from computers seized by police in the hope to identify additional victims. Reactions \\"We are appalled by the accusations against Rabbi Barry Freundel and wish to stress that the acts attributed to him are atrocious and strictly against Jewish law,\\" a spokesman for the Chief Rabbinate of Israel stated. The day Freundel was arrested, the president of the RCA, Rabbi Leonard Matanky, revealed that the Council investigated allegations earlier in the year that related to \\"ethical issues that came up regarding an issue with a woman,\\" but no action was taken. That may have been a reference to overnight train rides Freundel booked in May 2013 to and from Chicago, where he supposedly was to \\"conduct research.\\" It later transpired that he had traveled on both legs of the round-trip journey with a woman who was not his wife, with whom he shared a private sleeping berth. On October 20, the RCA issued a press release stating that it discovered in 2012 that Freundel had coerced conversion candidates into performing clerical work at his home and contributing money to his rabbinic court. The RCA also was able to confirm that he shared a checking account with a conversion candidate. At the time the RCA did not view these activities as rising to the level that would require Freundel's suspension, but did suspend him once he was arrested and, together with its affiliated Beth Din of America, launched its own investigation led by Allen Fagin, the chief professional at the Orthodox Union, and Eric Goldstein, CEO of the UJA-Federation of New York. Under Jakobovics's leadership, the synagogue turned its back on Freundel and directed all its attention to the victims of his actions by arranging a support group led by a licensed psychologist and consultations with therapists,http://www.kesher.org/post_arrest_resources as well as organizing a closed-to-the-media community meeting with Cathy L. Lanier, Washington's chief of police.http://www.kesher.org/event/jewish-social-services-and-chief-of- police-at-kesher-israel.html Two days after Freundel's arrest and suspension, Jakabovics addressed a packed synagogue at Shemini Atzeret services, declaring: \\"These sacred spaces ‚Äî our shul and our mikvah ‚Äî have now been tarnished. Our inviolability has been violated. Kesher and the mikvah will be a safe place again.\\" Freundel's arrest also sparked widespread debate about how mikvaot should be supervised, administered and protected from predators. Bethany Mandel, a writer who was converted by Freundel (and who he secretly filmed in the Georgetown mikvah on at least two occasions) proposed a ten- point \\"Bill of Rights\\" for converts. She was soon named, together with another female convert, to a new RCA committee charged with reviewing the entire conversion process, and was later chosen as one of The Forward 50 in recognition of her initiative. Rabbanit Chana Henkin, the founder and head of Nishmat, the Institute for Advanced Jewish Studies for Women in Jerusalem (who once spoke on the topic of \\"Women and the Future of Judaism\\" at Freundel's synagogue),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbq7VuMz4uY called for a new generation of religiously educated women to take control of the mikvaot. Lawsuits Georgetown University Law Center, where Freundel served as an adjunct lecturer On December 2, 2014 a student at Georgetown University Law Center, where Freundel taught a seminar on Jewish law, filed a lawsuit against Kesher Israel Congregation, Georgetown University and the National Capital Mikvah. The unnamed student had written a term paper on the mikvah, which received an \\"A\\" from Freundel, who had convinced her to immerse herself at the mikvah on two occasions, both of which she presumes he filmed. She sought class action status and claimed that the defendants turned a blind eye and failed in their responsibility to protect students from the rabbi, whose behavior she claimed was becoming ever more bizarre, and who was mistreating women subjected to his authority. On December 18, a student at Towson University identified only as \\"Stephanie\\" added her name to the lawsuit, claiming that Freundel encouraged her to take a \\"practice dunk\\" in the mikvah as part of her studies, even though she was not Jewish and had no interest in converting. She was joined by Emma Shulevitz, a woman who had been converting to Judaism under Freundel's auspices and who had likewise been encouraged by him to take a \\"practice dunk,\\" an anomaly that he said would help prevent any misstep on the day of the conversion. They added the RCA as a defendant as well. The plaintiffs claimed that the RCA and Freundel's synagogue were aware of his inappropriate conduct before the cameras were discovered in the ritual bath he supervised. They charged that the RCA and Kesher Israel should have removed Freundel from his positions of authority and that his alarming actions included inviting non-Jewish women to use the mikvah and inventing and encouraging the use of \\"practice dunks.\\" In response, RCA issued the following statement: \\"The RCA has conducted itself appropriately and is taking important steps to improve its conversion protocols. We will defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\\" Kesher Israel responded with this statement: \\"Kesher Israel's leadership is deeply concerned about the harm caused by Rabbi Freundel's actions ‚Äî of which we did not and could not have known ‚Äî and for the personal welfare of all those individuals who may have been violated. The lawsuits that were recently filed are completely without merit. Our energies remain focused on working towards healing our community and building a vibrant future for Kesher Israel.\\" In 2015, a congregant brought lawsuit against Freundel for allegedly transferring tens of thousands of dollars from her personal bank account into accounts of his own and in name of some of his children. She claimed she gave Freundel power of attorney when she traveled abroad and asked him to ensure should anything happen to her, she would have a Jewish burial. She also believed he used her apartment as a safehouse where he filmed at least one victim of domestic violence. While she was preparing an appeal in this litigation, she died and there was no one to continue the litigation on behalf of her estate. Right before her death, she was distraught that the rabbi's wife claimed in a deposition that she barely knew her, when she viewed the Freundels as her closest family. Lawsuits against Freundel and defendants began to gain steam in June 2016, when the Superior Court of the District of Columbia issued an order outlining the consolidation of claims against Freundel.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/class-case-arising-from- rabbis-voyeuristic-acts-takes-giant-leap-forward-300285043.html Sanford Heisler, LLP was appointed interim class counsel by the court, and co- counseled with the D.C. law firm of Chaikin, Sherman, Cammarata & Siegel, P.C., which filed one of the first class action lawsuits against Freundel, Kesher Israel, the National Capital Mikvah, and the Rabbinical Council of America in December 2014.https://www.chaikinandsherman.com/blog/2016/june/cscs-teams-with-interim- class-counsel-in-dc-rabb/ On August 16, 2016, the lawsuit was amended to add an additional defendant, the Beth Din of America.https://www.chaikinandsherman.com/blog/2016/august/amended-complaint- filed-in-class-action-against-/ On October 22, 2018, the D.C. Superior Court approved a $14.25 million class action settlement.https://www.chaikinandsherman.com/freundel-class-action-settlement/ According to the terms of the finalized settlement, women identified as having been videotaped by Freundel were entitled a base payment of $25,000. A $2,500 base payment was available to women who used the mikvah but were not confirmed as having been videotaped, and who suffered emotional distress after learning of Freundel's actions. Class members were also entitled to supplemental payment based on their individual experiences.https://www.chaikinandsherman.com/documents/FINAL_MikvahSettlement_Long- Form-Notice.pdf Plea bargain On February 11, prosecutors informed victims that of all the women appearing in the recordings seized from Freundel's home and office, only 152 could be positively identified from headshots submitted to the police department via email in the preceding weeks. Since evidence collection was conducted passively, with the Metropolitan Police accepting reports rather than seeking them out, many more women who had been recorded did not submit photographs to be considered for purposes of prosecution (or, in the case of students, mistakenly submitted them instead to campus police). Moreover, an untold number of recordings seized in the initial raid had been deleted and were not reconstructed by police. No charges were pursued for criminal trespass in connection with the rabbi's unauthorized use of the mikvah for unlawful purposes nor in connection with his transport of the recordings or of women for sexual purposes across state lines. Several dozen recordings of the 152 women positively identified fell outside the criminal statute of limitations. A handful of women requested not to have charges brought in connection with the recordings of them. Charges were brought per victim rather than per recording, so that multiple recordings of the same victim were treated as one count. All of the foregoing had the effect of whittling down the counts of voyeurism ultimately filed against the Rabbi to 88. Despite longstanding court procedures designed to protect the identity of victims of sexual assault, Assistant U.S. Attorney Amy Zubrensky cautioned victims against a trial, warning that it could expose the graphic recordings to the jury and media as well as opening them to cross-examination. Instead, Freundel would be offered a plea bargain that would not exclude the possibility of incarceration. The plea bargain was delivered to Freundel's attorney on February 18. In a court hearing the next day, Freundel pleaded guilty to 52 counts of voyeurism, one for each woman (not per instance of recording) whom prosecutors identified as having been recorded during the previous three years and who had not declined to have charges brought on her account. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zubrensky noted that in addition to the camera in a clock radio, Freundel had recorded women using mini-cameras embedded in a tissue box and a table-top fan. In addition, he surreptitiously videotaped a domestic violence abuse victim in the bathroom and bedroom of a safe house that he had established for her so she could escape her husband's violence. Sentencing Ronald Machen, United States Attorney for the District of Columbia at the time of Freundel's arrest Ronald Machen, then the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, indicated that he would push for a harsh sentence. \\"Bernard Freundel exploited his position of power to victimize dozens of women who entered a sacred, intimate space of religious ritual,\\" he said. \\"We will be seeking a prison sentence that reflects the gravity of this disturbing assault on the privacy and dignity of so many victims.\\" The statutory maximum punishment is a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 on each of the first 30 counts and $1,000 on the remainder. A week before the sentencing, prosecutors submitted a 25-page memorandum to Judge Geoffrey M. Alprin requesting a prison term of 17 years, or four months on each of the 52 counts. In his 12-page response, Freundel's defense attorney asked that his client be spared prison time and sentenced instead to community service. \\"He has already been punished in that he has lost his employment as a rabbi and is never likely to be so employed again,\\" Freundel's lawyer wrote. \\"He has been publicly humiliated and his prior reputation as a Judaic scholar, teacher and counselor have been destroyed.\\" On Friday, May 15, 2015, Freundel was sentenced by Judge Alprin in front of a packed courtroom to six-and-a-half years in prison and fined $13,000. \\"You repeatedly and secretly violated the trust your victims had in you, and you abused your power,\\" Alprin told Freundel, in handing down the punishment. Beforehand, 18 of Freundel's victims testified about their emotions. \\"He lectured us about the evils of porn while turning us into his own porn stars,\\" one victim told the court, choking back tears. Another said she fell into a deep depression and began using drugs. \\"I fell off the edge of this earth,\\" she said. Seven others took the stand on his behalf, several of whom claimed that he was now a changed man. \\"It tears my guts out to think of the innocent people I've traumatized,\\" Freundel, for his part, told the court, reading from a prepared text. \\"I am sorry.\\" \\"Today the court heard the heart-wrenching accounts of the victims of Barry Freundel's exploitation,\\" noted Acting U.S. Attorney Vincent H. Cohen, Jr. of the District of Columbia, in announcing the court's decision. \\"Their stories make clear the lasting scars that will be left by this outrageous abuse of power. This prosecution was an effort to restore the dignity that Barry Freundel tried to steal from these women. We hope that the scores of victims of his crimes will find some solace in the justice meted out by the court today.\\" \\"It is my hope that the many victims in this case draw a small measure of relief from the sentencing action today,\\" added Metropolitan Police Chief Lanier. \\"His actions wounded an entire religious community and showed a flagrant disregard for his position of trust within that community. I am confident that today's action by the courts will serve to continue the healing process for the many unwitting victims of this predator.\\" Prosecutors later revealed that among the videos Freundel stored at his residence were several he made of himself in \\"sexual situations\\" with other women, many of whom may have been unaware that the liaisons were being recorded. Freundel was taken from the courtroom to the D.C. Jail, where he was put in isolation for 23 hours a day due to threats against him. He appealed his sentence, claiming that he should have been punished only for a single videotaping, but his appeal was rejected by Judge Alprin on July 31. A second attempt to have his sentence reconsidered, made to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, was filed on June 21, 2016 but was unanimously rejected on September 15, 2016 by the three-man panel. Aftermath After reviewing the criminal complaint, search and arrest warrants, accompanying affidavits, as well as relevant halakha with respect to the status of prior conversions, the RCA declared that all conversions Freundel had performed until his arrest were valid.http://www.rabbis.org/index_with_RCA_response%20.cfm After an initial hesitation on its part, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel agreed, but warned that if Freundel were to attempt to perform any conversions in the future, they would not be recognized. When he was unanimously fired by Kesher Israel's board on November 24, 2014, Freundel was given a grace period until January 1, 2015 to vacate the synagogue-owned rabbinic residence, but one month after the deadline passed he still had not done so. As a result, Kesher Israel referred the matter to the Beth Din of America, asking that it order Freundel to move out, return all synagogue property, compensate the congregation for his occupancy of the house beyond the January 1 deadline, and cover the costs of the arbitration. He finally vacated the house on March 3, leaving it in a state of disrepair that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate. This litigation, however, did not involve Freundel's wife, Sharon, who moved out less than three weeks after his arrest. He acceded to her request for a get (a Jewish divorce document) shortly afterwards. Freundel resigned from his tenured position at Towson University one week after pleading guilty. While he was under suspension he continued to draw a salary, which totaled $30,830. Freundel was named by The Jewish Daily Forward to its \\"list of the 50 American Jews who have had the most impact on our national story\\" in 2014. In explaining his inclusion, the newspaper wrote that \\"It's hard to imagine a more disturbing violation of a sacred Jewish space than the one of which Orthodox rabbi Barry Freundel is accused.\\" The Israeli newspaper Haaretz ranked the \\"Peeping Rabbi\\" as number 1 on its list of \\"Ten scandals that rocked the Jewish world in 2014,\\" and noted that it did so \\"because the idea that any rabbi might (allegedly) use hidden cameras to spy on women in their most sacred place like the ritual bath and exploit the vulnerability of conversion candidates to Judaism is unfathomable.\\" In July 2015 an RCA review panel of six men and five women (including two converts) that was established in the wake of Freundel's arrest released a list of nine recommendations to guide the conversion process. These focused on \\"support for conversion candidates during and after their conversions, professionalism, transparency of expectations, sensitivity to candidates, educational experiences, the responsibilities and support for rabbis and rabbinic judges, and oversight, supervision, and grievance processing.\\" Freundel issued a public apology for his \\"heinous behavior\\" and \\"perverse mindset\\" on September 8, 2015, the eve of the Jewish High Holy Days, which are marked by repentance and forgiveness for sins. In July 2017, a morality play by a local Washington-area playwright, entitled \\"Constructive Fictions,\\" which was based on the Freundel scandal, ran at the Gallaudet University theater. On April 18, 2018, an automated email was sent to those of Freundel's victims who had signed up for updates on the criminal case against him, notifying them that he would be released from prison on August 21. The next day, however, the D.C. Department of Corrections sent a correction, admitting that the previous email was a mistake. Freundel was expected to be released on August 21, 2020, after receiving a one-year sentence reduction due to good behavior. However, he was released early on April 1, 2020 due to COVID-19. Positions=Abortion Freundel believed that according to the halakha, abortion is only permitted when a woman is in \\"hard travail\\" and her life is in danger. This is a very limiting position, Freundel pointed out, since there must be serious danger to the mother. This does, however, also include cases where there is significant psychological trauma, wherein continuing the pregnancy could inflict significant or mortal harm to the mother in that fashion (such as a rape victim who becomes suicidal). Freundel believed that there is no way, under Jewish law, to allow partial-birth abortion, since once the head has emerged, the baby is considered to be born.NRLC 2000 Most Abortions Forbidden by Jewish Law Cloning Freundel saw two issues with cloning humans from a halakhic perspective. The first is whether cloning is allowed, and the second is whether a clone would be considered a human being. He did not view cloning as being prohibited by halakha, and even saw \\"becoming a partner with God in the works of creation\\" as a noble goal. He did, however, support regulation, and at a hearing urged the United States Congress not to prohibit human cloning, but rather to regulate it. He argued that human knowledge and technology are inherently neutral, and it's what's done with them that is important.Congressional hearing, February 12, 1998 > Human beings do the best that they can. If our best cost/benefit analysis > says go ahead, we go ahead. \\"God protects the simple\\" is a Talmudic > principle that allows us to assume that when we do our best God will take > care of what we could not foresee or anticipate. If things do not work out, > the theological question is God's to answer; not ours.Cloning Human Beings , > Report and Recommendations of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, > June 1997. Freundel strongly maintained that a clone would be considered a human being under Jewish law.The Ethics Of Human Cloning Homosexuality Freundel published an article entitled Homosexuality and Judaism in the Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society. In it he argued that there is no category for \\"homosexual\\" in halakha. A homosexual then is no different from any other Jew who has committed a sin. Since Freundel viewed homosexuality as an activity rather than a state of being, he advocated the kiruv approach - trying to make a less observant Jew more observant by following halakha. > Judaism rejects the suggestions that homosexuality is either a form of > mental illness or an 'acceptable alternate lifestyle.' Judaism's positions > would be a third and as yet unconsidered option. Homosexuality is an > activity entered into volitionally by individuals, who may be > psychologically healthy, which is maladaptive and > inappropriate.Homosexuality and Judaism , Journal of Halacha and > Contemporary Society, Volume XI - 1986. Modern Orthodoxy Freundel wrote in a published article that \\"Modern Orthodoxy is not doing very well, because people are not living by its guiding principles. Even those who identify with the movement do not view the world through fealty to halakhah followed by modern modification.\\" Published works Freundel was the author of two books, eight journal articles and many op-eds. * Contemporary Orthodox Judaism's Response to Modernity, Ktav Publishing House, February 2003, * Why We Pray What We Pray: The Remarkable History of Jewish Prayer, Urim Publications, November 2010,  References External links * U.S. V.

","title":"Barry Freundel"},{"id":"3544804","text":"The Poet Daniel Tobin Daniel Tobin (born January 13, 1958) is an American poet, scholar, editor, and essayist, and the winner of numerous awards for his work, including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the Massachusetts Books Award, and the Julia Ward Howe Award, among many others.  Life  Daniel Tobin was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York to Gerard Tobin and Helen Ruane Tobin. Both parents were of Irish ancestry, and his upbringing in Brooklyn and his ancestral links to Ireland inform his poetry, scholarship, and teaching. He graduated from Xaverian High School before attending Iona College where he graduated with a B.A. in Religious Studies, as well as in Psychology. He also graduated from Harvard University with aa Master of Theological Studies, from Warren Wilson College with an M.F.A. in Poetry, and from the University of Virginia with a Ph.D. in Religion and Literature. He has taught at James Madison University in Virginia, Carthage College in Wisconsin, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College, with which he maintains an affiliation. He is presently Professor of Writing, Literature and Publishing at Emerson College in Boston, where he served previously as Department Chair and Interim Dean of the School of the Arts. He is a citizen of both America and Ireland where he keeps close personal and professional ties. He is married to poet and scholar, Christine Casson  Reception of the Poetry  Daniel Tobin‚Äôs poems have appeared in a myriad of journals, from The Times Literary Supplement to The Paris Review to Poetry, and hundreds of others on both sides in America and Europe, as well as in more than fifty anthologies, including The Norton Introduction to Poetry. Tobin‚Äôs first book of poems, Where the World is Made, won the Katherine Bakeless Nason Prize. The poems reveal a quest for transcendence with a strong theological impulse, though without appeal to dogma. The judge of the award, Ellen Bryant Voigt, called the book ‚Äúa musical Bildungroman‚Ä¶ a first book of remarkable authority.‚Äù Edward Hirsch praised the book as a ‚Äúwork profoundly alert to spiritual matters‚Äù composed of ‚Äòfinely wrought poems‚Ä¶ in search of the sacred,‚Äù and Eleanor Wilner viewed the poems as ‚Äúdarkly devotional‚Ä¶ unsparing, unsparing at times harrowing in their awareness.‚Äù Double Life followed Where the World is Made, a book that gained particular praise for its polyphonic sequence on the life of the Spanish plantation master turned friar, Bartolome de las Casas, and its ‚ÄúHomage to Bosh,‚Äù a long ekphrastic poem based on the paintings of Hieronymous Bosh. Eamonn Wall described The Narrows, Tobin‚Äôs third book which he describes as a ‚Äúmural in verse‚Äù as ‚Äúa prodigious feat of raw physical, moral, psychic and literary energy.‚Äù Of the book B.H Fairchild wrote: ‚ÄúAll stories of arrival and survival in America are the American story, but rarely are they told as compellingly as this one‚Ä¶ a poem of narrative power and astonishing lyric depth and grace.‚Äù A review of Second Things, his fourth book, marked Tobin as fast becoming ‚Äúone of the best poets of his generation.‚Äù Belated Heavens, in turn, won the Massachusetts Book Award. Of The Net, Tobin‚Äôs sixth book of poems, David Ferry remarked: These are very beautiful poems, and The Net is a very beautiful book‚Äù that displays ‚Äúan extraordinary capacity for using his resources as a poet through his command of diction and idiom, and through his versification.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe whole book is a master class in craft,‚Äù remarked Jill Alexander Essbaum. The book-length poem From Nothing, on the life of Jesuit priest and physicist, George LeMaitre, won the Julia Ward Howe Award and is part of a proposed three book trilogy. On From Nothing, Emily Grosholz reflects, ‚Äúthe poet draws the weft of scientific vocabulary through the warp of everyday speech.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn From Nothing,‚Äù Alan Shapiro declared, ‚ÄúTobin brings his learning and astounding imaginative powers to bear on such central questions as the origin and end of the universe‚Ä¶ a memorable, powerful and moving book that should be read by everyone who wonders how we got here and what our being here can mean.‚Äù Stepehn Schneider called The Stone in the Air, Tobin‚Äôs suite of translations from the German of Paul Celan, ‚Äúcompelling and haunting, a testimony to the power of language and poetry to confront the unspeakable.‚Äù The New York Times named Blood Labors one of the Best Poetry Books of the Year. ‚ÄúBlood Labors is an ebullient and ecclesiastical wonder, capturing more of creation, the uncreated, and the recreated than any dozen books on a poetry bookshelf,‚Äù Barbara Ras commented, ‚Äú[it] dazzles with its brilliance.‚Äù  Reception of Scholarship and Essays  Daniel Tobin has published numerous essays on poetry and poetics in journals like The Writer‚Äôs Chronicle, New Hibernia Review, Befrois, and Etudes Irlandais, and others, many of which have been reprinted in essay collections such as The Measured Word and Complexities of Motion. His book, Passage to the Center: Imagination and the Sacred in the Poetry of Seamus Heaney, is regarded as the foremost study of religious motifs in Irish the Nobel laureate‚Äôs work. His essay ‚ÄúBeyond Maps and Atlases: Transfiguration and Immanence in the Later Poems of Seamus Heaney‚Äù takes up the subject in Heaney‚Äôs later work, and appears with essays by other major Heaney scholars in ‚ÄúThe Soul Exceeds its circumstances: The Later Poetry of Seamus Heaney, edited by Eugene O‚ÄôBrien. Awake in America appeared in 2011, also to wide praise. ‚ÄúThis incisive and moving critique of poetry and tradition pushes the frontiers of Irish Studies,‚Äù Joseph Lennon observed, and it challenges ‚Äúscholars and readers to survey a new country of Irishness, at once inner, ardent and textual.‚Äù In On Serious Earth: Poetry and Transcendence, Tobin takes on the largest questions of meaning and durability of language turned to art in the wake of postmodernism. Rosanna Warren called it ‚Äúa complex, sophisticated, and magnanimous book,‚Äù and Bruce Bond hailed it as a book of ‚Äúunflinching sobriety and daring [in a] conversation too often shrill with hyperbole or lackluster with a chronic failure to commit... a smart and beautiful book.‚Äù  Editorial Work  Tobin‚Äôs The Book of Irish American Poetry from the Eighteenth Century to the Present is recognized internationally as the definitive volume of its kind. With its publication, Smurfit Professor of Irish Studies, Eamonn Wall, credited Tobin with ‚Äúthe invention of a whole new field.‚Äù Light in Hand: The Selected Early Poems of Lola Ridge, brought to new light the work of the transnational feminist, leftist poet after decades of neglect. The Poetry Society of the United Kingdom awarded his later edited volume, To the Many: The Collected Early Works of Lola Ridge, a Special Commendation.

It was similar to a high school or gymnasium but was only open to boys from noble families, and students were usually required to live on the premises. Tuition and accommodation in these institutions were free, and they were considered as a form of support to the impoverished noble families for their service to the Russian crown. The first Institute for Nobles was opened in Moscow in 1833. In 1838 the Second Gymnasium of Vilna (in what is now Lithuania) was reorganized into an Institute for Nobles. In 1843 the Penza Institute for Nobles was opened, followed by the Nizhny Novgorod Institute for Nobles that was opened in 1844. There was also an Institute for Nobles in Warsaw. Most of these Institutes for Nobles were closed in 1863. Only the Alexander II Nizhny Novgorod Institute for Nobles survived into the twentieth century, but it was closed after the October Revolution. Graduates of these institutes had the rights of the graduates of gymnasiums, in addition they had rights to enter universities without entrance examinations. By the end of the 19th century these institutes were abolished.

She is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her debut novel, published in 2001, was Good in Bed. Her novel In Her Shoes (2002) was made into a movie starring Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley MacLaine. Background and education Weiner was born to a Jewish family in DeRidder, Louisiana, where her father was stationed as an army physician. The next year, her family (including a younger sister and two brothers) moved to Simsbury, Connecticut, where Weiner spent her childhood. When Weiner was 16, her father abandoned the family. He died of a crack cocaine overdose in 2008. Her first novel, Good in Bed, is loosely based on her young-adult life: like the main character, Cannie Shapiro, Weiner's parents divorced when she was 16, and her mother came out as a lesbian at age 55. Weiner has said that she was \\"one of only nine Jewish kids in her high school class of 400\\" at Simsbury High School. She entered Princeton University at the age of 17 and graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. in English in 1991 after completing an 86-page- long senior thesis titled \\"'Never Far From Mother --' On the Uses of Essentialism in Novels and Films.\\" At Princeton, Weiner studied with J. D. McClatchy, Ann Lauterbach, John McPhee, Toni Morrison, and Joyce Carol Oates. Her first published story, \\"Tour of Duty,\\" appeared in Seventeen in 1992. Career After graduating from college, Weiner joined the Centre Daily Times, the daily newspaper of State College, Pennsylvania, where she managed the education beat and wrote a regular column called \\"Generation XIII\\" (referring to the 13th generation following the American Revolution), aka \\"Generation X.\\" From there, she moved on to Kentucky's Lexington Herald- Leader, still penning her \\"Generation XIII\\" column, before finding a job with The Philadelphia Inquirer as a features reporter. She continued to write for the Inquirer, freelancing on the side for Mademoiselle, Seventeen, and other publications, until after her first novel, Good in Bed, was published in 2001. In 2005, her second novel, In Her Shoes (2002), was made into a feature film starring Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette and Shirley MacLaine by 20th Century Fox. Her sixth novel, Best Friends Forever, was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller and made Publishers Weekly's list of the longest-running bestsellers of the year.\\"Bestsellers '10: The Year in Bestsellers\\". Publishers Weekly, January 10, 2011 To date, she is the author of nine bestselling books, including eight novels and a collection of short stories, with a reported 11 million copies in print in 36 countries.\\"Jennifer Weiner Broadens From Best-Sellers to TV\\". Associated Press, July 28, 2011 Her novel The Next Best Thing was published by Simon & Schuster in July 2012. Her writing on gender and culture appears frequently in The New York Times. Jennifer Weiner and Erica Jong at the Miami Book Fair International 2013 In addition to writing fiction, Weiner is a co- creator and executive producer of the (now-cancelled) ABC Family sitcom State of Georgia, and she is known for \\"live-tweeting\\" episodes of the reality dating shows The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. In 2011, TIME named her to its list of the Top 140 Twitter Feeds \\"shaping the conversation.\\"TIME's \\"Top 140 Twitter Feeds\\". March 28, 2011 She is a self-described feminist.A feminist fights back against 'chick lit' label, San Francisco Chronicle Criticism of gender bias in the media Weiner has been a vocal critic of what she sees as the male bias in the publishing industry and the media, alleging that books by male authors are better received than those written by women, that is, reviewed more often and more highly praised by critics. In 2010, she told The Huffington Post, \\"I think it's a very old and deep-seated double standard that holds that when a man writes about family and feelings, it's literature with a capital L, but when a woman considers the same topics, it's romance, or a beach book ‚Äì in short, it's something unworthy of a serious critic's attention. ... I think it's irrefutable that when it comes to picking favorites ‚Äì those lucky few writers who get the double reviews AND the fawning magazine profile AND the back-page essay space AND the op-ed ... the Times tends to pick white guys.\\"\\"Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Weiner Speak Out On Franzen Feud\\".

The Wall Street Journal, May 24, 2011 When Jonathan Franzen's novel Freedom was published in 2010 to critical acclaim and extensive media coverage (including a cover story in TIME\\"Jonathan Franzen: Great American Novelist\\". TIME, August 12, 2010), Weiner criticized what she saw as the ensuing \\"overcoverage,\\"\\"Jennifer Weiner speaks out against Jonathan Franzen 'overcoverage,'\\" The Guardian (UK), August 25, 2010 igniting a debate over whether the media's adulation of Franzen was an example of entrenched sexism within the literary establishment.\\"Can a Woman Be a 'Great American Novelist?\\" Slate.com, September 14, 2010\\"The READ: Franzen Fallout\\".

Slate.com, February 2, 2011\\"The Count 2010\\". vidaweb.org and Franzen himself, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, agreed with her: \\"To a considerable extent, I agree. When a male writer simply writes adequately about family, his book gets reviewed seriously, because: 'Wow, a man has actually taken some interest in the emotional texture of daily life', whereas with a woman it‚Äôs liable to be labelled chick-lit. There is a long-standing gender imbalance in what goes into the canon, however you want to define the canon.\\"\\"Jonathan Franzen interview\\". The Telegraph (UK), September 29, 2010 As for the label \\"chick lit\\", Weiner has expressed ambivalence towards it, embracing the genre it stands for while criticizing its use as a pejorative term for commercial women's fiction. \\"I‚Äôm not crazy about the label,\\" she has said, \\"because I think it comes with a built-in assumption that you‚Äôve written nothing more meaningful or substantial than a mouthful of cotton candy. As a result, critics react a certain way without ever reading the books.\\" In 2008, Weiner published a critique on her blog of a review by Curtis Sittenfeld of a Melissa Bank novel.\\"'The Wonder Spot': Sophie's Choices\\". The New York Times Book Review, June 5, 2005 Weiner deconstructs Sittenfeld's review, writing, \\"The more I think about the review, the more I think about the increasingly angry divide between ladies who write literature and chicks who write chick lit, the more it seems like a grown-up version of the smart versus pretty games of years ago; like so much jockeying for position in the cafeteria and mocking the girls who are nerdier/sluttier/stupider than you to make yourself feel more secure about your own place in the pecking order.\\"\\"A Moment of Jen\\". June 7, 2008 In November 2019, Weiner participated in the harassment and abuse of Brooke Nelson, a college student who was mentioned in her local newspaper as saying she thought that author Sarah Dessen's YA novels were not suitable for the Common Read program run by Northern State University, Aberdeen, and that she had advocated for the inclusion of civil rights attorney Bryan Stevenson's memoir, Just Mercy, instead. In a series of since-deleted tweets, Weiner described Nelson's opposition to Dessen's inclusion in the Common Reads program as \\"catty and cruel\\", part of \\"systemic discrimination\\" against young women, and linked it to coverage of gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar's repeated sexual assaults on young women. She later stated that she had \\"zero regrets\\" regarding these remarks. When the story was reported in Jezebel , The Guardian , the Washington Post , and Slate , Weiner reportedly regretted her actions.

Originally owned by the DeBartolo family, it opened in 1975. It was, and remains, the only major one located in the southern half of Dallas. Its original name, Red Bird Mall, came from the Red Bird area of Dallas in which it is located. Initially, it was anchored by four department stores: *Sears, which anchored on the eastern side of the mall closed its doors officially to the public January 6, 2019 as part of the closure of 33 Sears stores in the US following the parent company liquidation process for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. *JCPenney, which anchored the western end until 2001; The City of Dallas had possession of the space under a 6-month option to buy, which expired on June 7, 2010 (building has since been demolished). *Sanger-Harris (later Foley's, then Macy's), was in the middle of the mall on the northern side and closed in 2017. *Titche's (later Joske's, then purchased by and renamed Dillard's), was being redeveloped as Fiesta Mundo, but redevelopment stopped and that property still vacant, at middle of the mall on the southern side Later, Montgomery Ward added a store near the Sears location in 1994, on the same side as Dillard's, but was closed in 2001 and replaced by a Burlington Coat Factory. Many of the stores were either opening their first ones in the southern sector of Dallas, or relocated from older shopping centers in the area. The decline The mall did well in the beginning, despite its location in the relatively undeveloped southern portion of Dallas. It is located near the intersection of U.S. Route 67 and Interstate 20 at 3662 W. Camp Wisdom Road. As early as the mid-1980s, demographics began to change dramatically in the area surrounding it, and at the same time a perception of crime began to brand the area so shoppers began taking their business elsewhere. And, in 1988, another regional one, The Parks Mall in Arlington, opened just 15 miles west. DeBartolo attempted to remodel the mall in 1996, in an attempt to rejuvenate the look. It was then sold to Namco Financial, a California investment group founded by Ezri Namvar,https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/1997/06/09/story1.html who was later convicted of four counts of wire fraud. In an attempt to attract new tenants, Namco gave it a small refurbishment and new name ‚Äì Southwest Center Mall. The name changed in 1997. A new food court was added under the reign of DeBartolo. The addition was finished and occupied in 1998 at the northwest entrance. With a price tag of $18 million, it took up the lion's share of updates; upon its change of hands and change of name. In addition, though, Dillard‚Äôs increased their store size from 100,000 to , and Sears renovated their entire store in 1998. Montgomery Ward and J.C. Penney left the mall closing their stores in the mall in 2001. This marked the beginning of the end of the mall as stores such as Sam Goody and Old Navy (which had moved in in 2000) closed their locations in 2003 with other big name stores following suit including Dillards. Namco attempted unsuccessfully to sell the mall to General Growth Properties in 2004. The property eventually went into bankruptcy in 2008; then foreclosure, the lender Madison Capital picked it up, Cityview Commercial was formed as a partner with Madison. A dynamic General Manager formed a partnership with the city, community, and ownership to assist with the endeavor of turning it around. Much progress was made, the General Manager resigned, and Boxer was hired to manage the property. The former General Manager is slated to rejoin it in April 2011 and is tasked with the final 25% of development and lease up. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Southwest Center Mall, into Seritage Growth Properties.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/3450-w-camp-wisdom- rd/3312627/landing In 2017, Macy's left the mall leaving another vacant anchor spot as the mall continued its struggles. On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide.https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/15/sears-holdings- bankruptcy-store-closures/1645971002/ The future Although the mall faced bankruptcy in 2008 and ultimately went through foreclosure, The Woodmont Company was hired by the Bankruptcy Trustee to manage it. In August 2008, Woodmont hired a dynamic general manager, which in turn created a team that truly revitalized it. The lender, Madison Capital, picked it up and Retail SWC Mall LLC was formed as a partner with Madison. The City of Dallas hired the ULI (Urban Land Institute) to assess the property and give their recommendations. The City of Dallas then paid to have the six-month option to purchase the former JCPenney building. They did not exercise their option. The former Dillard's building was being built out as a Fiesta Mundo and went into bankruptcy 2011. The general manager created a partnership with the city, community, lender, and ownership to assist with the endeavor of turning it around. Much progress was made, then the general manager resigned; Boxer followed as the management company. The former general manager rejoined it in April 2011 and is charged with the final development and lease up (last 25%).

The network is aimed primarily at the Hispanic community in the United States. The channel broadcasts from studio facilities at ESPN's traditional bases of operations in Los Angeles, and Bristol, Connecticut, along with their Mexican base in Mexico City. ESPN Deportes is available on most pay-television providers including Comcast, Altice USA, AT&T; U-verse, Cox Communications, Charter Communications, Dish Network, and DirecTV. According to Nielsen, ESPN Deportes is available to at least 5.5 million Hispanic households in the United States through a programming package that includes the channel. Conversely, ESPN does not maintain second audio program audio feeds on any of their English-language channels in the United States (except for ABC's SAP Spanish coverage for the NBA Finals), allowing full exclusivity to ESPN Deportes for the Spanish rights to their properties. History ESPN Deportes launched as an alternate Spanish-language programming feed in July 2001, when ESPN and Major League Baseball began offering Spanish-language telecasts of the Home Run Derby and select Sunday Night Baseball game telecasts. By 2003, this simulcast was expanded to all Sunday Night Baseball and Sunday Night Football game broadcasts, as well as boxing. ESPN Deportes became a separate 24-hour sports subscription channel on January 7, 2004. In 2007, ESPN Deportes began producing a daily English language segment featured during the overnight editions of its American parent network's SportsCenter program, hosted by Michele LaFountain and several other personalities. ESPN Deportes launched a 720p high definition simulcast feed in April 2011, though as many American Spanish-language cable network packages remain with the majority of networks in standard definition, ESPN Deportes maintains their \\"BottomLine\\" news ticker in a form designed for 4:3 sets, matching the form seen on ESPN Classic and ESPN on ABC broadcasts. However as of 2016, the BottomLine ticker has since expanded to the 16:9 design used by the other ESPN networks. On December 7, 2015, the network debuted its new four-studio production facility in Mexico City with the Spanish version of SportsCenter. Jorge Eduardo S√°nchez and Carolina Padr√≥n anchored the first SportsCenter from the new studios which also featured well-known Mexican journalist Jos√© Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez interviewing Mexican football managers Tom√°s Boy and Miguel Herrera. On January 4, 2016, the network moved all their shows produced in Mexico to the new facilities, including F√∫tbol Picante, Los Capitanes and Cron√≥metro.

The TRRA encompasses , abutting SR 24, SR13, and the interchange connecting the two highways, southwest of the Caldecott Tunnel.The park is part of the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD). History of the lake Lake Temescal was created in 1869, after Anthony Chabot won a contract to supply the town of Oakland, California with drinking water. Chabot had already become notable by developing a method of extracting gold from the Sierra Nevada mountains with high-pressure water cannons. He decided to use the same technique to construct a reservoir by blasting the walls above Temescal Creek, and recovering the dirt and rocks to build an earthen dam across the creek. Slack, Gordy. \\"Reservoirs: What's a lake like you doing in a place like this?\\" Bay Nature magazine. July - September 2003. Accessed May 11, 2017. Chabot had already formed the Contra Costa Water Company to pump water from the proposed reservoir to the Oakland water system. By 1875, Oakland's population had grown to about 25,000 from about 10,000 when the dam was first completed. It was obvious that Lake Temescal was too small to remain the primary source of the city's water, so Chabot's company moved farther south to construct a much larger reservoir, later named Lake Chabot. Temescal became only a secondary source. Temescal Creek in Temescal Regional Recreation Area, September 18, 2006 Lake Temescal is the main attraction in the park, which also offers trails, picnic areas, forest habitats, and bird watching. The lake was originally constructed as a drinking water reservoir for the city of Oakland.

His second cousin's son is Denver Broncos safety Su'a Cravens. College career After graduating from John C. Fremont Senior High School in Los Angeles, Fulcher played college football at Arizona State University. While playing for the Sun Devils, Fulcher was known for his cover skills and punishing tackles. He earned the nickname \\"Fo-Rock\\" after tackling an opposing wide receiver in a game against New Mexico State University. \\"The guy laid there for a while, then got up and was dizzy. Then he said 'Man, I feel like I ran into a rock,'\\" Fulcher explained. \\"My teammates started calling me 'Rock'. A lot of people, when they pronounce my last name, say 'Fo-cher. So I just put the 'Fo' in front of Rock.\\" (1) After his junior season was over in 1986, Fulcher declared himself eligible for the NFL draft. He finished his three seasons at Arizona State with 12 interceptions, 4 as a freshman, 2 as a sophomore, and 6 as a junior. NFL career Fulcher was selected by the Bengals in the third round of the NFL Draft. After just two NFL seasons, Fulcher was viewed as one of the top defensive backs in the NFL. In 1988, he recorded five interceptions and one touchdown, and earned his first trip to the Pro Bowl. The Bengals finished the season with a 12-4 record and went on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIII, where they ended up losing narrowly to the 49ers 20-16 after quarterback Joe Montana threw the game-winning touchdown pass with 34 seconds left. In the game, Fulcher recorded several key tackles, a sack and forced a fumble that the Bengals recovered. Fulcher later said this game was his most memorable NFL moment. \\"It was the time they called my name during the introductions at the Super Bowl,\\" he said. \\"Walking out of the tunnel at Joe Robbie Stadium, making sure I did not trip on the turf and fall down.\\"(2). In 1989, Fulcher recorded eight interceptions, at the time the second-highest single-season total by a Bengals player. He also tied a Bengals record by recording three interceptions in one game, a feat he accomplished twice. Fulcher once again was selected to play in the Pro Bowl, but the Bengals finished the year with an 8-8 record and failed to make the playoffs. In 1990 Fulcher made the Pro Bowl for the third year in a row. He intercepted four passes, forced three fumbles and recorded 53 solo tackles. The Bengals finished the season 9-7 and made it to the divisional playoffs, with Fulcher recording an interception in both of their playoff games. This would be the last winning season Fulcher would have playing for the Bengals, as they would not record a winning record again until 2005. In 1991, he led the team with 68 solo tackles, four forced fumbles (recovering three of them) and he intercepted four passes, returning them for 51 yards and a touchdown. In his final season in Cincinnati in 1992, he intercepted three passes and recovered five fumbles. Fulcher joined the Raiders as a free agent in 1993, but due to injuries he only played three games, and retired after the season. In his eight NFL seasons, Fulcher recorded 10 forced fumbles, nine fumble recoveries, 12 fumble-return yards, 31 interceptions, 246 interception return yards and two touchdowns. His 31 interceptions are the third most in Bengals history behind Ken Riley and Louis Breeden. After the NFL Fulcher was named sixth on a list of \\"All-Time Cincinnati Bengals\\" in 2017. He is active in fundraising and awareness activities, especially for multiple sclerosis, and founded the non-profit MANA (Mentoring Against Negative Actions), working with inmates to teach them life skills.http://www.davidfulcher.com/fw/main/Davids- Biography-1625.html Fulcher is also the Alumni President for the Walter Camp Football Foundation.

Established in 1867, it is one of New York's oldest boarding schools. The Storm King School is a college preparatory school for students in grades 8 to post-graduate, with an enrollment of 195 and 37 faculty living on or near campus through the year. The Storm King School ranks as the 36th best boarding school in North Americahttps://thebestschools.org/features/best-boarding-schools-in-us/. The school‚Äôs recent crop of graduates matriculated into some of the top universities in the United States including Harvard University, The University of Chicago, Georgetown University, NYU Stern School of Business, Tufts University, Wellesley College, University of Virginia and The US Military Academy at West Point. Furthermore, the students at the Storm King School have been nominated to serve as Pages at the United States Senatehttps://www.schumer.senate.gov/students/page-program/, won prestigious scholarships with the United States Senate Youth Programhttps://ussenateyouth.org, appeared in the top 20 of the American Idol competition and received athletic scholarships to NCAA programs throughout the nationhttps://www.hartfordhawks.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=5564. The school enrolls students from 27 countries; 75% percent of students are boarding and 25% are day students; 53% are male, and 47% female. The school is accredited by the New York Association of Independent Schoolshttps://www.nysais.org/page.cfm?p=923, and is a member of the New York State Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schoolshttps://www.nais.org/about/, the College Boardhttps://www.collegeboard.org, and other education organizations. A 15-member Board of Trustees governs the schoolhttps://sks.org/about- sks/school-leadership/. Location The Storm King School is in Orange County, N.Y., about an hour's drive north of New York City, It sits approximately 900 feet above the west bank of the Hudson River, on a spur of Storm King Mountain, with views of the Shawangunk Mountains and distant Catskills. It adjoins Black Rock Forest Nature Preserve to the south. The school lies in the historic Hudson Valley between West Point and Newburgh. The nearby Storm King Art Center is an outdoor sculpture museum with work by world-class sculptors and artists. History The Storm King School began in 1867 as the Cornwall Heights School. Dr. Louis P. Ledouxhttps://sks.org/ledoux/, a graduate of Amherst College and Union Theological Seminary, and a pastor of the Cornwall Presbyterian Church, founded the school after requests that he establish ‚Äúa Christian school in the home of a Christian gentleman.‚Äù Dr. Ledoux purchased Wood Farm on the northern slope of Storm King Mountain, where he prepared young men for New England colleges until 1872, when he sold his interest in the school to Oren S. Cobb. Mr. Cobb was headmaster for 15 years until 1889, when the school was sold to Dr. Carlos H. Stone. During Stone's 29-year leadership, the school saw much growth, including increased enrollment and an enlarged physical plant. In 1914, the school was incorporated under New York State law and renamed the Stone School. In 1923, during the tenure of Headmaster Alvan P. Duerr, the school's name was changed to Storm King School. In 1928, the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York chartered SKS as a tax-exempt educational institution. From 1932 to 1951, throughout the austere years of the Depression and World War II, SKS was led by Headmaster Anson Barker, and benefited from the patronage and participation of several prominent families who lived on the mountain, including the Abbotts, Ledouxs, Matthiesens, Partridges, Smidts and Stillmans. Margaret Clarkhttps://sks.org/about- sks/history/, the school's first female teacher (primarily in art), retired in 1938 after over forty years at SKS. Her design of the school's crest, initially created for the student publication ‚ÄúThe Echo‚Äù, was later adopted as the school's official emblem. During the 1950s and 1960s, the school saw considerable growth thanks in part to Stephen P. Duggan, an attorney and long- time member and chairman of the Board of Trustees who owned property adjacent to the school. Mr. Duggan oversaw the rebuilding of SKS's then 44-acre campus, including construction of The Ogden Library (1958), Dyer Hall (1958), Highmount Dormitory (1958), Dempsey Dormitory (1959), Stillman Science Building (1960‚Äì61) and a new gymnasium (1963). In 1967 the school celebrated its 100th anniversary. It was the culmination of a nearly decade-long modernization project championed by chairman Duggan and successive SKS headmasters Burke Boyce (1952‚Äì1956), Warren Leonard (1956‚Äì1966) and Frank Brogan (1966‚Äì1974). During centenary celebrations, ambassador-at-large Averell W. Harrimanhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/W-Averell-Harriman dedicated the new Walter Orr Student Commons. In April 1968, the campus's 100-year-old Main Building, known as \\"Old Main\\", was demolished to make way for a new dormitory. Residents of Old Main moved into the new McConnell Hall in the spring of 1968. The school became coeducational in September 1970. In 1981, Dr. Rients and Suzanne Van der Woude of Cornwall gave the school 70 acres of land on Storm King Mountain, just west of the campus. Dr. Van der Woude said he gave the land in order ‚Äúto preserve it forever and so that children can learn about nature and ecology, and respect for life and earth.‚Äù The gift expanded SKS's campus to 125 acres.Girard B. Henderson (Class of '23) provided a significant grant that launched the Henderson Outdoor Recreation Program at Storm King School. The Van der Woude property was part of a historic 17-year dispute between New York utility Consolidated Edison and the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conferencehttps://casetext.com/case/scenic-hudson-preservation-v- fed-power, a group of concerned residents and citizens. In 1963, Con Ed planned a massive hydroelectric plant on Storm King Mountain which would have required cutting through the mountain and flooding the Black Rock Forest to create a reservoir. Due largely to opposition from the Preservation Conference, Con Ed's plan was abandoned and the suit settled in 1982. In 1990, during the tenure of Headmaster John H. Suitor, a roll-off shed observatory was built on campus to house a late-19th century refractor telescope, a gift of board member Robert Cobb, that was originally owned by Erard Mathiessan. It was eventually sold to finance the purchase of the school's current Parks Newtonian telescope. The observatory was designed and built by former SKS astronomy teacher and science writer Bob Berman. Parks Newtonian telescope Signature Programs The Capstone Projecthttps://sks.org/academics/signature-courses/ is a voluntary, independent research project beginning in the spring of the junior year and completed in the fall of the senior year. It synthesizes learning from previously completed courses while focusing on the School's bedrock Skills and Knowledge for Success (S.K.S.). These 21st century skills include strategic reading, writing, research, problem solving, technological proficiency, collaboration, and oral presentation skills. Students are guided through the process by a course instructor as well as ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù who are faculty or community mentors, with project-specific knowledge. The Q-Terms are short, intensive courses that provide faculty and students a chance to explore more deeply subject matter for which they have a particular passion and curiosity. Students meet with the same class and instructors every day and pursue only the subject related to their Q-Term. Such focus creates an arena for project- based learning, creative design, and service opportunities that enrich and deepen students‚Äô connection to the content. Domestic & International Travel complements the School's academic curriculum and community service program and adds yet another dimension to Storm King's already vibrant student life. Storm King students broaden their horizons, experience different cultures, and learn about the natural world through trips to Costa Rica, Peru, Fiji, Cuba, the Galapagos Islands, New York City, Boston, the Adirondacks, and many othershttps://sks.org/student-life/2019-2020-trips/. Traditions Mountain Day The entire Storm King School community scales Storm King Mountain together to mark the beginning of the new school year. This tradition dates back to 1932 when Headmaster Anson Barker instituted the very first Mountain Day. Hudson River Plunge In early spring, a hearty group of students and faculty take ‚Äúthe Plunge‚Äù into the icy waters of the Hudson River. This event, organized by the SKS Chapter of the National Honor Society to raise funds for charitable causes, has become a Storm King tradition full of laughs and cheers. Arts Weekend Creativity comes to life during Spring Arts Weekend. This annual event celebrates various branches of the visual, performing, and language arts. Thursday Night Dinners Every meal offers an amazing selection of healthy and delicious foods, but Thursday evenings are extra special as our chefs prepare ‚Äúfamily style‚Äù dinners for the entire community. Formal dress is worn and students and faculty take the time to slow down and enjoy pleasant conversation. Afterwards, all head to the theater for a thought-provoking program. Ringing of the Bell After each home win at an athletic event, the victorious SKS team rushes to the bell tower in the center of campus to ring the bell to signal their triumph. The Storm King Cup The Storm King Cuphttps://sks.org/the-story-behind-storm-kings-alumni-awards/ is awarded to a SKS student each year, during commencement, ‚Äúto encourage high ideals, manly sport, tenacity of purpose, earnest behavior, fair play, and true chivalry. College Placement Storm King graduates attend some of the top universities in the United States, including Cornell University, University of Chicago, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgetown University, Tufts University, Georgia Tech, NYU Stern School of Business, Northwestern University, Parsons School of Design, Pratt Institute, Rhode Island School of Design, University of California Los Angeles, University of Michigan, Washington University in St. Louis, Wellesley College, Wake Forest University, The United States Military Academy at West Point and many others. Co-Curricular Activities In addition to traditional academic courses and ESL, The Storm King School offers theater and visual arts, music, dance, sports, and various clubs and community service. Arts The Storm King School's arts programhttps://sks.org/visual-and-performing-arts/ includes Studio Art, Ceramics, Photography, Filmmaking, Fashion Design, Acting, Stagecraft, music, voice, dance, and much more. Facilities include the 230-seat Walter Reade Jr. Theatre, the Allison Vladimir Art Center. Athletics The Storm King School has a full athletic curriculum and competes in the New England Prep School Athletic League and competes in 18 different sports and activities. Storm King fields 26 teams at the varsity, junior varsity, and club level and is a member of The Hudson Valley Athletic League (HVAL) and The New England Private School Athletic Council (NEPSAC).http://www.sks.org/athletics Storm King is a member of the Positive Coaching Alliance.

In the summer of 1621, he was involved in a minor altercation with the Plymouth colony involving the Patuxet refugee Tisquantum (\\"Squanto\\") at present-day Middleborough, Massachusetts. Corbitant had menaced both Tisquantum and his companion Hobomok for their close ties with the white strangers. Fearing for their lives, Hobomok was able to get away and escaped back to Plymouth, where he rallied the pilgrims under Miles Standish. Standish led ten men of Plymouth in arms to rescue Tisquantum from Corbitant. They attacked the Wampanoag village at Nemasket, but by that time Corbitant had released Squanto and withdrawn from the area.

Majority of the classes are held and majority of the faculty units, namely the Biology, Chemistry, Integrated Science, Math, and Humanities Units, have their offices in the Science and Humanities Building.Faculty Units, PSHS Main Campus website The Curriculum Instructions and Services Division (CISD) Office, Student Services Division (SSD) Office, Office of the Registrar, Office of the Director, and the school library are all located on the 2nd floor of the same building. The Science and Humanities Building The Computer Science Unit, Art Design Technology Unit, Physics Unit and the Management Information System (MIS) are located in the Advanced Science and Technology Building. Classes in Computer Science I-IV, Technology Preparation, Biology II, and Physics III-IV are usually held in this building. Sophomore, junior, and senior electives such as Advanced Chemistry, Life Science, Problem-Based Physics, and Embedded Systems are likewise held in this building. The campus also includes four dormitories: three for boys and one for girls. The boys' and girls' dormitories are subdivided in turn by class (one for first- and second-year students, one for third- and fourth-year students).Dormitories, PSHS Main Campus website Recreational facilities on campus include a multipurpose gymnasium, supplying bowling lanes, pingpong tables, a dance room, basketball court and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Outside the gym a football field, concessionaires, track oval, and volleyball, tennis, and another basketball court may also be found . Classes=Admissions To be admitted to the PSHS System, a prospective student must pass the PSHS National Competitive Exam. The top 240 students of the exam are guaranteed slots in the Main Campus. In case a student doesn't want to enter the school, or wants to transfer to another campus, students from the waiting list are called up to be enrolled in the Main Campus in order to complete the 240 slots allotted by the system.Freshman Applicants, PSHS Main Campus website They are then divided into 8 sections with 30 students or less in each section. After the first year of the batch, slots emptied by dismissed students or those who choose to transfer are then filled by new students who qualify via a placement exam given to students who belong to the top percentage of their batch in another school.Transfer, PSHS Main Campus website However, currently only up to grade 9 students are allowed to be transferees. Afterwards, the remaining students are the only ones left who can graduate at the Main Campus. Students from the Main Campus may transfer to other campuses. Students from the regional campuses may apply for transfer to the Main Campus. However, they must meet a grade requirement. Students outside the Philippine Science High School System may also apply for transfer to the Main Campus. However, they must take a lateral exam and must meet a grade requirement. Sections The Main Campus has around 30 students in each class, with 8 classes per batch, in a total of about 240 students in each year level. The names of the sections in each year level are in accordance to a theme based on the major subject offered in that particular year level in the former 4-year curriculum. (Earth Science for Grade 7, Biology for Grade 8, Chemistry for Grade 9, and Physics for Grade 10.) In the new 6-year curriculum, sections of Grades 11-12 are both assigned the first 8 letters of the alphabet and are called blocks. Streaming Streaming to Technology and Science streams began on June 1995. Only 2 sections out of the 8 in each 'batch' were chosen to be in the Technology stream. Prior to 2005, incoming freshmen batches were required to take a streaming exam to determine their mathematics and sciences aptitude. Those who had rather high scores were put into the so-called \\"Technology Stream\\" and had a set curriculum that includes drafting and technology research. The \\"Science Stream\\" had art and earth science classes in the first and second years and had more leeway in choosing their electives, which include English and Filipino journalism, microbiology, microprocessing, and visual communications. Starting from Batch 2009, streaming was abolished. Instead of having 90 students taking technology electives during the second year, based on the student's first year performance and desired stream, every student has a fair chance of experiencing both the science and technology stream. Curriculum Students undergo through a curriculum which emphasizes the sciences and mathematics. During the Grades 7-9, the students all have a unified core curriculum with a heavier load to their math and science subjects. For grade 10, the same is true but they get to choose one elective subject. For SYP or Grades 11-12, they get to choose a core and elective science, along with their research and humanities subjects. Special Curriculum, PSHS Main Campus website Student life=Organizations Students may join a variety of co-curricular organizations, such as the Student Council (SC), AKSIS (Social Sciences Club), Concern and Action for the Rehabilitation of the Environment (CARE), Physics Youth Honours Society (PYHS), Mathematics Club, Astronomical Society (ASTROSOC), Invictus (Debate Club), SARS+ (Society for the Advancement of Research in Science and Technology) and the Atom Family (Chemistry Club). Likewise, extra-curricular associations are present in PSHS. These include the Science Scholar and Lagablab (English and Filipino student publications, respectively); theater groups such as Sightlines and Kamalayan, and dance groups such as SAGALA (Sayaw Galaw); the Himig Agham choral club; and the Samahan ng Manunugtog sa Pisay (SAMAPI), which annually holds concerts during the School Fair; Bravura, the classical music club; Balamesa, the board games club; Computron the computer science club under which is Likha, the digital media interest group; Pisay.XYZ, the maker club; Exposure, the photography club; Alianti, the Ultimate frisbee club, Labuyo, the boys‚Äô soccer club; LAAB, the girls‚Äô soccer club; Flux, the swim club; Silakbo, the girls' basketball club; Pallastro, the boys' basketball club; Kislap, the volleyball club; Alyabo, the arnis club; and Volant, the badminton club. Athletics Olympic-size swimming pool at the PSHS. Contrary to the common perception that PSHS students are too preoccupied with studies to even engage in sports, a culture of athletic competition pervades the campus. The basketball and volleyball teams have had limited success owing to the lack of tall students entering the school, but have also produced athletes who have been successful at the college intramural levels. PSHS has also produced athletes in other sports (such as track and field, streetdance, and chess) who have participated in the collegiate athletic leagues such as the UAAP. The school also holds intramural events for major sports, while the dormitories sponsor basketball leagues. YMSAT and Humanities Week The school holds a Youth Math Science and Technology (YMSAT) Week annually, typically during the 1st or 2nd week of March. During this week, special science projects are presented by various year levels not only to the whole Philippine Science High School community but to some visiting schools as well. Annual Interscholastic Competitions are held as well, while the fourth year students compete with each other in defending their year-long Science and Technology Research (STR) projects during the Research Fair. Aside from the YMSAT Week, the school also annually holds Humanities Week in the month of August or September. During this week, students showcase their month-long rehearsed presentations for the annual Patimpalak sa Filipino. First year students showcase Kilos Awit, second year students present Sabayang Pagbigkas, third year students do non-conventional music, while fourth year students perform interpretative dances.

Charge Amplifier schematic The amplifier offsets the input current using a feedback reference capacitor, and produces an output voltage inversely proportional to the value of the reference capacitor but proportional to the total input charge flowing during the specified time period. The circuit therefore acts as a charge-to-voltage converter. The gain of the circuit depends on the values of the feedback capacitor.  Design  Charge amplifiers are usually constructed using an operational amplifier or other high gain semiconductor circuit with a negative feedback capacitor. The input current is offset by a negative feedback current flowing in the capacitor, which is generated by an increase in output voltage of the amplifier. The output voltage is therefore dependent on the value of input current it has to offset and the inverse of the value of the feedback capacitor. The greater the capacitor value, the less output voltage has to be generated to produce a particular feedback current. The input impedance of the circuit is almost zero because of the Miller effect. Hence all the stray capacitances (the cable capacitance, the amplifier input capacitance, etc.) are virtually grounded and they have no influence on the output signal.Transducers with Charge Output Ideal circuit The circuit operates by passing a current through a capacitor Cf. The opamp strives to retain the virtual ground condition at the input by off-setting the effect of the input current. If the op-amp is assumed to be ideal, nodes v1 and v2 are held equal, and so v2 is a virtual ground. The opamp generates a compensating current flow through the series capacitor to maintain the virtual ground. This charges or discharges the capacitor over time. Because the capacitor is connected to a virtual ground, the input current does not vary with capacitor charge and a linear integration of output is achieved. The relationship between electric charge and current is governed by: : Q = \\\\int_0^t i(t)dt Therefore, the input- output equation of the charge amplifier is: :v_{\\\\text{0}} = -\\\\frac{1}{C_{\\\\text{F}}} Q Applications Common applications include amplification of signals from devices such as piezoelectric sensors and photodiodes, in which the charge output from the device is converted into a voltage. Charge amplifiers are also used extensively in instruments measuring ionizing radiation, such as the proportional counter or the scintillation counter, where the energy of each pulse of detected radiation due to an ionising event must be measured. Integrating the charge pulses from the detector gives a translation of input pulse energy to a peak voltage output, which can then be measured for each pulse. Normally this then goes to discrimination circuits or a multi channel analyzer. Charge amplifiers are also used in the readout circuitry of CCD imagers and flat-panel X-ray detector arrays. The amplifier is able to convert the very small charge stored within an in-pixel capacitor to a voltage level that can be easily processed. Advantages of charge amplifiers include: * Enables quasi-static measurements in certain situations, such as constant pressures on a piezo lasting several minutes * Piezo element transducer can be used in much hotter environments than those with internal electronics * Gain is dependent only on the feedback capacitor, unlike voltage amplifiers, which are affected greatly by the input capacitance of the amplifier and the parallel capacitance of the cable Other uses * Accelerometer signal conditioning * Guitar pickup amplifiers * Vibration transducers  See also  * Obtaining virtual zero impedance by applying Miller theorem * Charge Transfer Amplifier  References  External links  * Interface Circuits for Polyvinylidene fluoride film * Schematic diagram *Piezo signal conditioners tutorial Category:Electronic amplifiers ","title":"Charge amplifier"},{"id":"3544942","text":"The Fiat 4 HP (also known as the 3¬Ω HP or 3¬Ω CV) was the first model of car produced by FIAT, from 1899 to 1900 based on a third party design. Background The 4 HP is related to the Ceirano brothers‚ÄîGiovanni, Ernesto and Matteo‚Äîwho were an influential force in kick-starting the Italian automotive industry. In fact, they are variously responsible for creating companies including Ceirano GB & C, Itala, SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino) and SPA (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Design In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Ceirano started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal in Italy. In October 1898, Giovanni then co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. Its coachwork was by Marcello Alessio. In July 1899, the Welleyes' plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli who then produced the 4 HP, which became the first ever FIAT. The car had a water-cooled 0.7-liter (679 cc) 2-cylinder, rear-mounted engine producing 4.2 horsepower at 800 rpm, coupled with a three-speed gearbox without reversing gear. Its top speed was . and it had a fuel consumption of .

It caters to scientifically and mathematically gifted high school students from the Southern Mindanao region of the country. It is located in Barangay Sto. Ni√±o, Tugbok District, Davao City. History PSHS-SMC Admin Building PSHS-SMC, formerly called PSHS Mindanao Campus prior to the creation of PSHS Central Mindanao Campus in Lanao del Norte, was first established at the Philippine Coconut Authority grounds in Bago Oshiro, Barangay Mintal in Tugbok District. It was officially founded on July 8, 1988. However, due to the increasing number of students, the school administration decided to relocate to a larger. The new building's infrastructure was completed in 1990. By 1995, the school grounds' muddy and asphalt lanes were cemented, the gardens were replanted and redesigned, and cleanliness was maintained. The school surroundings gradually evolved into a park. Years after, a spacious gymnasium was put up at the back of the boys' dormitory. A small footbridge has to be crossed in order to reach the gym. In 2008, renovation of the gym resumed. With the new stage completed, it was temporarily opened in March that year for the recognition and graduation rites, the last of which that former director Dr. Rosita V. Fundador would be attending. The school administration decided to add another building, the Science and Technology, for the laboratories as well as the mini-auditorium, which seats 90 people. The building's infrastructure was completed in 2011 and was launched in the same year. Construction for an oval track behind the outdoor courts, which in turn are located behind the gym, has been ongoing since mid-2012. Currently, the campus is composed of the following: the Administration Building, the Academic Building (where classes are held), the Boys' and Girls' Residence Halls, the Gym, the Canteen, and the Science and Technology Building (to house the laboratories). new buildings add more info plox For 19 years since its conception, the PSHS-SMC had been under the care of Dr. Fundador before her mandatory retirement. She was then succeeded by Mrs. Delia C. Legaspino as the campus' second director. Admission Admission to the PSHS-SMC is possible only for the first year and, in uncommon cases, lateral entry in the second and third years. Applicants from grade six (or grade seven) must take and perform well in the National Competitive Examination (NCE), the admission test of the Philippine Science High School System, also indicating their interest in the Southern Mindanao Campus. Tests *Abstract Reasoning *Mathematics *Science *English Curriculum The PSHS-SMC follows the same curriculum prescribed by the Philippine Science High School System. However, the electives offered do vary per campus. Electives Before the implementation of the K12 curriculum, students were required to take up one elective subject per year equivalent to one (1) unit starting from their second year. However, as a result of the new curriculum starting S.Y. 2012-2013, the batch of 2018 (K+12 Pioneers), will have their electives starting from their fourth year. =Fourth Year= * Linguistics * Microbiology * English Journalism * Filipino Journalism * Applied Mathematics * Electronics * Computer Science Summer Science Internship Program In the summer before their fifth year, each student is required to render 80 hours in an approved workplace for exposure in work related to science and technology to comply with their Summer Science Internship Program (SSIP) requirement. Students can become interns in various agencies, whether international, national, or local. Some interns fulfill their working hours in government agencies (e.g. DOST), educational institutions (e.g. De La Salle University) or even private corporations (e.g. Coca-Cola). Despite having no impact in the scholars' grades, it is a mandatory requirement for graduation. A student that fails to fulfill the minimum number of hours in their chosen agency will be due for rejection for graduation. After the fulfillment of the 80 working hours in their selected institution, they are required to pass a portfolio that showcases their work in their agency. Privileged students who attend the Ateneo Junior Summer Seminar (AJSS) of the Ateneo de Manila University are no longer required to render service as their participation in the AJSS is considered for their SSIP. Academic Grading System Grades are reported in terms of the stanine. 1.00 is the highest grade while 5.00 is a failing mark. 2.50 is the passing grade and any grade lower than this is termed substandard. The student's current standing for a subject is calculated by adding 1/3 of the previous quarter's grade and 2/3 of the tentative grade of the quarter. The GWA (General Weighted Average) of the student should be 2.25 or better to be in good standing. Director's List Every quarter, students who garner a general weighted average (GWA) of 1.50 or better are included in an honor roll known as the Director's List. Graduation During their commencement exercises, students who have had outstanding performance in the past four years are given additional recognition. =Honors= * Highest Honors - GWA of 1.20 or better * High Honors - GWA of 1.50 or better =Proficiency Awards= The following awards are given to individual students who have performed excellently in various fields as deemed by the management and the faculty: * Proficiency in Biology * Proficiency in Chemistry * Proficiency in Physics * Proficiency in Mathematics * Proficiency in English * Proficiency in Filipino * Proficiency in Social Science * Proficiency in Computer Science * Proficiency in English Journalism * Proficiency in PEHM (Physical Education, Health and Music) * Proficiency in Filipino Journalism * Proficiency in Research * Proficiency in Art =Special Awards= Based on particular criteria, the following special awards are also given: * DOST Secretary Award for Model Science Scholar * Gerry Roxas Leadership Award * Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo Leadership Award (given in previous years) Student Organizations Each student is required to have membership in one of the following clubs: * Student Government (SG), the organization which \\"spearheads student-related activities and provides student services such as policies, projects and events for the benefit of the student body as a whole.\\" (SG Constitution and By-Laws, Article I, Section 2) * Math Club, one of the two primary Sci-Camp co- facilitators * Science Club, one of the two primary Sci-Camp co-facilitators * Junior Ecologists' Movement (JEM) Facilitates environmental concerns in the campus. * Sci-Wings, the English publication club. * Bagwis Agham, the Filipino publication club. * Oasioas, the dance troupe * Sports Club, the annual Intramurals facilitator * Pisay Theatre Arts Klub (Pitak), a club for theater arts (hence the name). * Glee Club, the club for singers and instrumentalists. * Robotics Club * Debate Club *e-Snap, the photography club *Software Development Club *Game Development Club *Red Cross Youth Each club elects their next set of officers before the end of year.

Chelsea's gravity-power is very strong, and she is a tough opponent. She always argues with Rumina and always gets into a fight with each other, however she later respects him and also develops feelings for him. ; Voiced by: Gabe Khouth (English) :Ginosuke is Rumina's best friend since childhood. He has no special elemental powers, but he is very intelligent although he isn't exactly what one would refer to as 'street smart'. He later uses a very useful weapon that fires elemental attacks. His personality is somewhat timid, but he has a lot of common sense, and can be very fierce if he has to be. Ginosuke always wears his very thick glasses that change his appearance so much that his friends can't recognize him without them. Allies ; :A rebel against the company who uses an Aerogun. Referred to Ginnosuke as \\"Master Sui\\" after he saved him from Company agents. Hates the Company after they took his lover away and destroyed the village they were living in. Joins in on the fight again Pairon's Fang and discovers his lover was a mind-control puppet of Sound. He is able to restore her memories after the fight. Later searches for Rumina's group in the slums and joins Ginnosuke's team in the Tournament. ; :Shiel is an Electric User who is first seen as a Company Agent sent out to confirm Rumina's elemental powers. Following the recapturing of Ruri by Company agents Pairon and Teil, she is assigned as her replacement bodyguard. As their relationship deepens, Shiel undergoes a change of heart (much like Chelsea) and helps Ruri escape for a second time. She views Ruri as a sister following their time together. ; :Member #2 of the Rorec Fan Club, helps Rumina's group for the sake of Chelsea. Beings to notice the Company's corruption after seeing Pairon's look upon Rumina. After falling to the slums, she becomes part of Ginnosuke's team in the tournament in hopes to find Rumina and Chelsea. ; :Member #3 of the Rorec Fan Club; she can be found to be violent when someone insults Chelsea, such as Rumina calling Chelsea \\"blondie\\". After falling to the slums, she becomes part of Ginnosuke's team in the tournament in hopes to find Rumina and Chelsea. ; :A Magnetism User and younger brother to Rou. Desires to be an A-Class Soldier to the company, better than Kashin and Seki. When Pairon gave him the opportunity by killing Rumina's group, he took it with his brother joining him in the effort. When he lost, as Pairon foresaw, he was sent down to the slums with Rumina's group, Rou, and Shamuri. Despite his differences, he joins Rumina's team in the Tournament to get out of the slums and find his brother. Uses metal yo-yos as his weapons. He seems to have concerns and feelings for a beast-hybrid girl, 04. ; :A hybrid-beast girl who rounds up Rumina, Chelsea, and Kourin to participate in the Tournament, in order to gain a wish from the Slum's mysterious leader. Wants to get out of the slums so she kind find info on helping her with her condition: if she fights too much she can get feral, resulting in using too much energy and might die. Kourin knows of her condition and promises to help her out. The Company The contains thousands of elemental users, and most are hostile. They wish to bring complete destruction to those who dwell on the surface. Their hatred for the surface world stems from the belief that they were abandoned by them, which really isn't true since only the scientists actually knew of their existence underground. They are also the people who want to awaken the dragons (called \\"ron\\") to complete their revenge and are willing to sacrifice Ruri to accomplish their goal. Chelsea and Shiel both turn against the company in order to get Ruri (Maiden of Life) to safety and away from the company. ;Lord :The leader/founder of the Company, ranked #1. He organized the Company to make the Underground a better place. He strongly desires to take revenge on the surface, after he was forced to kill his sister who was attached to a machine by the scientists. Because of how Ruri remind Kashin of his sister, he's shown to be very caring toward her; he even was very upset at Pairon for upsetting her. Also, Seki is his long-time friend. It is later revealed that Kashin's sister was actually the original Maiden of Life, and Ruri was cloned from her when the attempt to use her to revive the Ron failed. ; :Ranked #2 in the Company and has Ruri's custody in his jurisdiction. Proven to be the most sinister and cunning member in the Company. Pairon is a \\"Pure\\" Water user, permitting him to be unaffected by electricity and subdue people by their blood (a person's body is 80% made of water). Compared to everyone in the Underground, he has no background information, which gave Seki concerns. Has a hatred toward Kashin, especially when he gave him the scars on his face. ; :Ranked #3 in the Company, a scientist in charge of finding where the Ron are sealed. Reports to Pairon on his efforts. ; :Ranked #5 in the Company, a Fire user, one of the 8 A-class warriors, and co-founder/long-time friend of Kashin. The first Company agent sent after Ruri and Chelsea and originally killed Rumina. Impressed of Rumina's wind powers after being revived by Ruri. Suspicious of Pairon methods and activities as he has no background info left behind by the scientists. ; :The highest-ranked soldier of the Company. A reckless Water-user who loves a challenge. Went with Pairon to capture Ruri at Rumina's school. After being defeated by Rumina, he was determined for a rematch, which he did at the Underground Hole. When Rumina tried to save him, Tailor told him about the Underground's bitterness toward the surface, especially when his poor parents sold him to the scientists. He removed Rumina's grip and fell down the Underground Hole, claiming he will not die and will cross paths with Rumina again. Also, referred to by Rumina as \\"pony- tail\\". ; :A large magnetism-user. Fought Chelsea and Rumina in an Underground village and lost. Later, joined his younger brother Kourin(another magnetism user) to fight Rumina and the others, but lost again. After being thrown to the Slums, join Ginnosuke's group in the Tournament in hopes to find his younger brother. ; :A female ice-user who wields a whip. Fought Chelsea at the Underground Hole and lost. Been spying on Rumina's group afterwards, planning a rematch with Chelsea, but ends up in the Slums. Found by Shiel and joins Rumina's team in the Tournament in hopes of getting out of the slums. ;Pairon's Fang :A band of highly or death-sentenced criminals who help Pairon keep the \\"peace\\" and search for power-users. Sent after Ruri during her second escape and kill Rumina's group. They were all defeated before Ruri was re- captured by Pairon. Members: Heat, a big guy who uses heat energy for explosions and superstrength (defeated by Chelsea); Smoke, a swordsman with smoke generating powers and multiple bladed weapons (defeated by Rumina); Sound Illusion; a sadistic child who uses sound vibration attacks and a flute to mind control people into his slaves, like Sui's lover (defeated after being fooled by Jilherts that she was under his control); and Shadow, a female who uses nerve gas to fool people she can move between shadows (defeated by Ginnosuke with his aerogun). The Ron Like the elemental power user humans, the Ron were created by the same scientists. According to Chelsea, they physically resemble dragons of mythology but are merely artificial forms of life. The Ron lie dormant, but the Company intends to use Ruri's power of life to revive them and set them upon the surface world to punish those who had wronged them so many years ago. The Ron share the same bitterness as most of the Underground humans. When they are finally seen, it is revealed that in their dormant state the Ron resemble dolphins, and only become the dragon-like life forms through the Maiden's power.

Early life James was born in Queenstown, Tasmania, the son of an Anglican priest. His early life was unsettled as his father moved between parishes. In 1934 he started at Canberra Grammar School, meeting his lifelong friend Gough Whitlam (who later became Prime Minister of Australia). He was expelled the next year after a theological dispute with the headmaster and later attended Fort Street High School. He completed his Leaving Certificate in 1936. Between 1937 and 1939 James served with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). At the outbreak of World War II, James travelled to Britain and joined the Royal Air Force, enlisting on the last day of the Battle of Britain. After pilot training and operations, he was shot down over France on Anzac Day, 25 April 1942, receiving severe burns to his face and eyes. He was captured, caused a great deal of trouble in German military hospitals and POW camps, and was then repatriated, through Cairo Red Cross, because of his injuries. He was formally invalided out of the Royal Air Force in April 1945 and received a Totally and Permanently Incapacitated pension from the British Government for the rest of his life. In the same month he married Joyce Staff in London. Publishing career After returning to Australia, James was employed as a journalist with The Sydney Morning Herald in 1950. He was a distinctive figure, habitually wearing a black broad-brimmed hat and a cloak. In 1952, James took over management of The Anglican, a publication of the Church of England. In 1960, The Anglican was subject to a takeover bid by Frank Packer's Australian Consolidated Press (ACP), which culminated in a street brawl in which Packer's forces unsuccessfully attempted to occupy the building. Controversy continued when in 1964, James was fined 50 pounds for the offensive publication of the Oz magazine. During the 1960s he used The Anglican to campaign against the Vietnam War and in 1966 stood as a candidate for the Liberal Reform Group in the federal election. He visited North Vietnam twice. Imprisonment in China In 1969, James was arrested in China for alleged spying. The reasons for his behaviour remain unclear, but it is often thought he was playing a practical joke. After four years' imprisonment, he was released and expelled in 1973 after lobbying by his old friend Gough Whitlam, who was then Prime Minister. Francis James died in 1992, aged 74.

Watson Co., more commonly known as Watson's was a department store chain based in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. It was founded in 1907 and grew to many locations throughout the Southeastern United States. The company was purchased for $4.45 million by Peebles with the transaction closing June 29, 1998.Peebles Inc ¬∑ 8-K/A ¬∑ For 6/29/98 Filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission History Expanding from the original operation, the company opened a group of downtown stores in county seat towns. As shopping centers and malls developed, Watson's opened substantially larger stores in those locations. Operations grew from a single location in Knoxville, Tennessee to numerous locations in Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, and Illinois. The merchandise was purchased and distributed to all of the Watson's stores from the centralized warehouse located at the corporate offices in Knoxville. The company hit hard times in the late 1980s and eventually filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in February 1992 when they were unable to renew bank financing. At the time of the filing, the company operated 31 stores in nine states. The courts approved a reorganization plan for the company to emerge from Chapter 11 in 6 years. Profitability improved and Watson's emerged from Chapter 11 in about half of the anticipated time though the company never fully recovered. Through a series of lackluster upper management hires in the early to late '1990s, the company continued its downward spiral. In the end, the company that prospered by selling goods in remote areas of the southeast where competitors were few, could not compete with the new Walmart and Goodys Family Clothing stores as these companies began to build in markets that were once considered too small. Watson's business model was viable no longer. Watson's was purchased in June 1998 by Peebles, a then privately held retailer based in South Hill, Virginia. At that time, Watson's became a wholly owned subsidiary of Peebles. All Watson's stores were converted to Peebles a year later. The former Watson's Knoxville Distribution Center at 200 Hayfield Road continues to serve as one of two warehouses for the Peebles chain. Peebles was purchased by Houston, Texas-based Specialty Retailers in 2003.

Falsified evidence could be created by either side in a case (including the police/prosecution in a criminal case), or by someone sympathetic to either side. Misleading by suppressing evidence can also be considered a form of false evidence (by omission), however, in some cases, suppressed evidence is excluded because it cannot be proved the accused was aware of the items found or of their location. The analysis of evidence (forensic evidence) may also be forged if the person doing the forensic work finds it easier to fabricate evidence and test results than to perform the actual work involved. Parallel construction is a form of false evidence in which the evidence is truthful but its origins are untruthfully described, at times in order to avoid evidence being excluded as inadmissible due to unlawful means of procurement such as an unlawful search. Apart from the desire for one side or another to succeed or fail in its case, the exact rationale for falsifying evidence can vary. Falsifying evidence to procure the conviction of those honestly believed guilty is considered a form of police corruption even though it is intended to (and may) result in the conviction of the guilty; however it may also reflect the incorrect prejudices of the falsifier, and it also tends to encourage corrupt police behavior generally. In the United Kingdom, this is sometimes called 'Noble Cause Corruption.' A \\"throw down,\\" i.e. the planting of a weapon at a crime scene might be used by the police to justify shooting the victim in self-defense, and avoid possible prosecution for manslaughter. However, the accused might have falsified some evidence, especially if not arrested immediately, or by having other access to a crime scene and related areas. Types * Forged evidence - an item or information manufactured, or altered, to support some agenda, is not admissible in many courts, including U.S. criminal courts. * Planted evidence - an item or information which has been moved, or planted at a scene, to seem related to the accused party, is not admissible in many courts, including U.S. criminal courts. * Tainted evidence - information which has been obtained by illegal means or has been revealed (or traced) using evidence acquired by illegal search, and/or seizure, is called the \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\" and is not admissible in many courts, including U.S. criminal courts. * Parallel construction - tainted evidence, where the origin of the evidence is untruthfully represented, preventing discussion of whether it was legally obtained or not. * Suppressed evidence - an item or information which a court judge has ruled as \\"inadmissible\\" is forbidden to be presented in a court case. Suppressed evidence might be excluded because it was found hidden or locked away in areas the accused could not be proven to know. In some criminal cases, a person will be identified as a \\"person of interest\\" for a few days before arrest, allowing time to reveal suspicious actions (such as in recorded phone calls), or to attempt to falsify evidence before their arrest. A type of falsified evidence, used to acquit, would be faked sales receipts which indicated activities (with the accused) had occurred elsewhere during the time of the crime. Cases=The Crewe murders In June 1970 a Pukekawa, Lower Waikato, couple were killed and their bodies dumped in the Waikato River. Arthur Allan Thomas, a local farmer, was twice convicted of their murders but following massive publicity was later given a Royal Pardon. Two bullet cases presented by senior policemen Hutton and Johnston were crucial evidence for the conviction. In 1980, after Thomas's pardon a Royal commission into the convictions concluded \\"Mr Hutton and Mr Johnston planted the shellcase, exhibit 350 in the Crewe garden, and that they did so to manufacture evidence that Mr Thomas's rifle had been used for the killings.\\"  Killing of Bernard Whitehurst  In 1975, after the shooting death of Bernard Whitehurst by a Montgomery, Alabama police officer who mistakenly thought Whitehurst was the suspect in the robbery of a neighborhood grocery store, there was a police cover-up that included police officers planting a gun on him from the police evidence room. The coroner relied on police reports that Whitehurst was killed by a bullet fired through the chest. After an investigation by the local newspaper and local attorney Donald Watkins raised questions about the facts of the case, six months later, the District Attorney James Evans ordered the body to be exhumed and an autopsy to be performed. The results of the autopsy showed that Whitehurst had been shot in the back. The attempted cover-up led to the resignation of eight police officers, the city‚Äôs mayor, James Robinson and the Director of Public Safety, Ed Wright. No police officer was convicted of a crime. Forty years later, the Montgomery City Council passed a resolution that formally expressed regret for the shooting and cover-up. Murder of Holly Staker In 1992, 11-year-old Holly Staker was raped and murdered while babysitting in Waukegan, Illinois. A local man named Juan Rivera was convicted of the murder solely on the basis of a confession, one that he claimed was coerced. No physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and many details of his confession contradicted known evidence from the crime scene. DNA testing done in 2004 on semen taken from the crime scene ruled out Rivera as the source, however, the prosecution argued that the semen sample came from previous consensual sex with another man. Rivera was convicted again. His conviction was overturned by the appellate court who took the unusual step of barring prosecutors from retrying Rivera and he was released. After his release, Rivera's attorneys asked the courts to order genetic testing on a piece of evidence the prosecution had tried to use at his trial in 1993. Rivera's shoes had blood on them, which the prosecution argued belonged to Holly. The prosecution withdrew them prior to his first trial when it was discovered that the shoes were not available for sale anywhere in the United States until after the murder. In 2015, Juan's attorney sought further forensic testing on the shoes. DNA analysis indicated that the blood indeed belonged to Holly, but also contained another genetic sample; one that matched the semen sample. Rivera's defense team insists that this is proof not only that the blood was planted, but that the real killer's DNA was inadvertently planted as well. The DNA has yet to be matched to an individual, but has been linked to DNA from another home invasion and murder. The man convicted of that crime also claims to be wrongfully convicted. Following his exoneration, he was awarded $20 million USD, the largest wrongful conviction settlement in US history. New York State Police Troop C scandal In the New York State Police Troop C scandal of 1993, Craig D. Harvey, a New York State Police trooper, was charged with fabricating evidence. Harvey admitted he and another trooper lifted fingerprints from items the suspect, John Spencer, touched while in Troop C headquarters during booking. He attached the fingerprints to evidence cards and later claimed that he had pulled the fingerprints from the scene of the murder. The forged evidence was used during trial and John Spencer was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison. After the truth came out, it was discovered that they had been falsifying evidence in cases for many years. At least three officers were convicted. Every case the department had been involved in had to be reinvestigated. FBI scandal In the 1990s, the fingerprint, DNA, and explosive units of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory had written reports confirming local police department theories without actually performing the work. Such laws and regulatory procedures stipulating the conditions under which evidence can be handled and manipulated fall under a body of due process statues called chain of custody rules. It is crucial for law enforcement agencies to scrupulously collect, handle and transfer evidence in order to avoid its falsification. In most jurisdictions, chain of evidence rules require that the transfer of criminal evidence be handled by as few persons as possible. To prevent error or improper tampering, chain of evidence rules also stipulate that those authorized to experiment with collected evidence document the nature, time, date and duration of their handling.

Hutchinson (born November 1, 1977) is a current front office consultant for the Seattle Seahawks and former American football guard who played twelve seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Michigan, and was named a unanimous All- American. The Seattle Seahawks picked him in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft, and he also played for the Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee Titans. He is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection. He was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020. In March of 2020, Hutchinson joined the Seattle Seahawks front office as a football consultant. Early years Hutchinson was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He attended Coral Springs High School in Coral Springs, Florida, and played high school football for the Coral Springs Colts. He graduated in 1996. In 2007, he was named to FHSAA's All-Century Team that listed the Top 33 football players in the state of Florida's 100-year history of high school football. College career While attending the University of Michigan, Hutchinson played for coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football team from 1996 to 2000. During his redshirt year in 1996, he moved from defensive tackle to offensive guard, and earned a starting position on the 1997 Michigan team that won the Associated Press national championship. Hutchinson excelled as a four-year starter, and did not allow a sack during his final two seasons as a Wolverine. He was a two-year team captain, four- year All-Big Ten selection, Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year, and a two- time All-American--including unanimous first-team All-American honors as a senior in 2000.2011 NCAA Football Records Book, Award Winners, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 11 (2011). Retrieved June 24, 2012. He also won the Jim Parker Award from the Touchdown Club of Columbus, and was an Outland Trophy finalist. Professional career=Seattle Seahawks Drafted in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks, Hutchinson spent his first five seasons with that team. In March 2006, Hutchinson, a free agent, was designated as Seattle's transition player. While with the Seahawks, Hutchinson made it to 3 Pro Bowls and earned 3 All-Pro honors. He was also a key lineman who blocked for Shaun Alexander in his 2005 MVP season on the way to the Seahawks appearance in Super Bowl XL, where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 10-21. This would be his final game as a member of the Seattle Seahawks. Minnesota Vikings Hutchinson blocking B. J. Raji on November 14, 2011. Following the opening of free agency, Hutchinson signed a controversial offer sheet from the Vikings, $49 million over seven years, which was believed to be the richest contract ever offered a guard at the time. The offer sheet, though, contained a poison pill provision that would have guaranteed his entire salary if he was not the highest-paid lineman on the team. At the time, NFL rules required that if a team signed a player with the transition tag to an offer sheet, the original team had to either match the offer sheet exactly or relinquish their rights to that player. While the tag was not triggered during his time with the Vikings‚Äîhe was released by the Vikings in March 2012‚Äîthe Seahawks had recently given tackle Walter Jones a contract richer than the one offered to Hutchinson. Thus, the team would have triggered the \\"poison pill\\" clause immediately and would have been forced, by NFL rules, to immediately guarantee Hutchinson's entire salary. Since doing so would have destroyed their salary cap, they could not match the offer. Moreover, since they only used their transition tag, rather than naming Hutchinson a franchise player, they received no compensation from Minnesota for their loss. Seattle retaliated, though, by signing Minnesota wide receiver Nate Burleson to an offer sheet containing a similar ploy. Because of this controversy, the NFL banned the use of \\"poison pills\\". Hutchinson played 59 straight games while with the Vikings, not missing a start. On December 21, 2010, Hutchinson was put on injured reserve by the Vikings. Hutchinson also ended the 2011 NFL Season on injured reserve. During the first 11-years of his NFL career, Hutchinson had started in all 157 games that he had played in. However, the Minnesota Vikings announced that they had released Hutchinson on March 10, 2012. On March 14, 2012, Hutchinson met with the Seattle Seahawks to work out a possible deal with his former team. Tennessee Titans On March 15, 2012, Hutchinson signed a three-year deal with the Tennessee Titans.Source: Steve Hutchinson to Titans Retirement On March 11, 2013, Hutchinson announced his retirement.

At 92.4 per cent, the English Montreal School Board has the highest success rate among public school boards in Quebec. This success rate is only slightly lower than the success rate for private schools . The EMSB is one of two English school boards on the island of Montreal. Its territory consists of the city of Montreal proper as well as the centre and eastern sectors of the island. Anglophone public education in the western portion of Montreal Island is administered by the Lester B. Pearson School Board. The Acting Director General of the EMSB is Evelyne Alfonsi, She is the school board's chief administrative officer. Currently, the EMSB is under partial trusteeship. The Ministry of Education appointed former Liberal Member of Parliament, Marlene Jennings, as the trustee in November. Structurally, the EMSB has two Assistant Director Generals: Beno√Æt Duh√™me and a vacant secondary position. The school board also has two directors, one which oversees the elementary schools and the other, high schools. EMSB Administration Building The Administration Building of the EMSB is located at 6000 Fielding Avenue in Notre-Dame-de- Gr√¢ce. The building was formerly occupied by the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal (PSBGM). History The Government of Quebec reorganized the province's public school boards in the mid-1990s. School boards in Quebec had been organized along confessional lines, Catholic and Protestant, since before Canadian Confederation. The province of Quebec was guaranteed a confessional public school system by the British North America Act, 1867, now known as the Constitution Act, 1867. The provincial government was therefore required to ask the federal government to amend the Canadian Constitution if it were to reorganize school boards along linguistic lines (English and French). The amendment was passed by both the House of Commons and the Senate, notwithstanding the unresolved constitutional debate between Quebec and the rest of Canada. The EMSB officially began operations on July 1, 1998 after the English sectors of the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal (PSBGM), the Montreal Catholic School Commission (CECM), the Commission scolaire J√©r√¥me-Le Royer and the Commission scolaire Sainte-Croix were amalgamated to form the EMSB.\\"EMSB Home.\\" Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. April 22, 1999. Retrieved on March 22, 2011. The political infighting among the board's commissioners has received significant coverage in Montreal's English- language media, most notably the Montreal Gazette. This fighting, for the most part, had previously pitted Catholics vs. Protestants. That division has recently become much less significant, however. The harmonization of the previous boards' administrative policies as well as the debate over school closings due to declining enrollment have been especially inflammatory. In 2005, both the Montreal Gazette and the French-language tabloid Le Journal de Montr√©al printed a special series of articles denouncing alleged nepotism and graft in the province's public school boards. The Gazette's investigation focused almost exclusively on the hiring practices of the English Montreal School Board. A recent Supreme Court of Canada ruling requiring provincial public bodies to hold open meetings will challenge its board of commissioners, which habitually meets behind closed doors. Enrolment in the English Montreal School Board's schools and centres continues to decline as it does in most anglophone public school boards in Quebec. This is a part of an ongoing decline which began with the enactment of the Charter of the French Language by the Qu√©bec government In 1977. Since the EMSB's creation in 1998, the board has closed 21 schools, most recently 2 elementary schools and 1 high school in 2020. The School Board's chairperson attributes the declining enrolment to Bill 101, families moving to cities with lower home taxes such as Laval, and the general decline in birth rates.https://montrealgazette.com/life/High+profile+candidates+compete+EMSB+chairperson/10274846/story.html The EMSB had the highest voter turnout among all school boards in Quebec, with 18%. In 2019, the EMSB said it would not enforce Bill 21, the Government of Quebec's proposed ban of public servants wearing religious symbols, stating that the board has never received a complaint from a parent or student about a teacher's religious symbol.

He served in the United States Navy during World War II aboard the . He toiled in a factory before joining the Marine Corps in 1948. He mentioned how harsh the training at Parris Island was at the time. For example, he and his fellow recruits were once forced to crawl through pig manure as part of a drill. McKeon served in the Korean War for fourteen months as the leader of a machine gun squad. After the war, McKeon was selected for drill instructor training. He completed the rigorous school graduating 14th out of 55 (90 students had begun the course). His superiors thought him bright, hard-working and alert. The psychiatrists who examined him found no evidence of mental abnormality, but did mention he had a tendency towards acting before thinking. Ribbon Creek incident McKeon was assigned to Platoon 71, \\"A\\" Company, 3rd Recruit Training Battalion. On Sunday night, April 8, 1956, between 8 p.m. and 8.45 p.m., he marched 74 men of Platoon 71 from their barracks to Ribbon Creek, one of the tidal streams on Parris Island, and led the men into the water. Some of them got into depths over their heads, panic ensued, and six recruits drowned in the resulting confusion. The ill-fated march set off immediate repercussions which shook Marine Corps training from top to bottom. Moreover, an uninterrupted flood of publicity by the press, radio, and television divided the country into two camps, those who condemned McKeon for what had happened and those who sympathized with him. General Randolph McCall Pate, Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time of the incident and the time of the trial of SSgt Matthew McKeon, US Marine Corps, testified as a witness for the defense. His court- martial began at Parris Island on July 16, 1956.

McKeon was represented by noted defense attorney Emile Zola Berman. Aftermath McKeon was acquitted on August 4, 1956, of charges of manslaughter and oppression of troops. He was found guilty of negligent homicide and drinking on duty. The sentence was a $270 fine, nine months of confinement at hard labor, rank reduced to private and a bad conduct discharge. The Secretary of the Navy later reduced the sentence to three months in the brig, reduction to private with no discharge and no fine. McKeon was transferred to a Marine base in Cherry Point, North Carolina, and attempted to rebuild his shattered career.

McKeon lived out his life in West Boylston, Massachusetts, and made his living as an inspector of standards for the state. In 1970, he told Newsweek that he was always haunted by the Ribbon Creek tragedy and the fact that the young men who drowned would have now had families of their own. He said he prayed every day for forgiveness and to keep the boys in God's safekeeping. He was survived by his wife, five children and eight grandchildren.

The university offers a six-year Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc) program, and it advanced the degree to a six-year Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM). It accepts about 100 students a year. It has launched a four-year Bachelor of Animal Science (BASc) program since 2014. It accepts about 100 students a year. It also offers graduate (PhD, MPhil, MVM and MVSc) degree programs. The language of instruction at UVS is English. History Veterinary science education in Myanmar began in 1890 during the British colonial rule when the Veterinary Assistant Training School was opened at Shan Road in Kyimyindaing, Yangon. The school offered a two-year program, and senior veterinary officer Bhattiwallah was its first principal. In 1920, the school was upgraded, and the faculty was expanded by 12 veterinary inspectors and five veterinary superintendents, all non-Burmese. In 1923, the first Burmese veterinarian, Pe Than, a graduate of Bengal Veterinary College, was appointed a vet superintendent at the school. In February 1925, Governor Sir Harcourt Butler laid the foundation stone for the construction of the school's new building in Insein that would later bear his name. By 1931, the original two-year program had been extended to three years. In 1957, the Veterinary College, a Faculty of Rangoon University was established at the Insein campus. The school's four-year BSc (Veterinary) program accepted university students who passed Intermediate Science Part II with distinctions in zoology, chemistry and physics. In 1964, the college became the Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science (IAHVS) ( ), under the Ministry of Education, offering a six-year BVSc program. From 1957 to 1975, the two-year vet assistant program at the Veterinary Assistant Training School and the bachelor's degree program at the IAHVS were concurrently offered by two different government ministries. In 1981, the IAHVS was relocated to Yezin, Pyinmana (now part of Naypyidaw). In October 1999, the institute's name was formally changed to the present name in both English and Burmese. During the 1990s, the UVS like most universities in the country was repeatedly closed by the military government fearing of student unrest. On 31 December 1994, the institute came under the administration of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries. The university began offering postgraduate courses for MPhil in 1988, MVSc and MSc programs in 1992, and three-year doctoral (PhD) programs in 2007. The government has sent some of the faculty to the Universiti Putra Malaysia for doctoral studies. The total number of graduates at the university between 1957 and 2012 was 4409. The Japanese government has sponsored two to three Burmese veterinarians for MSc and PhD courses each year since 2000. A new generation of foreign trained veterinarians has begun to take over the teaching roles at the UVS, with some of them as departmental head and/or professors. Some staff from UVS were also supported by German Academic Exchange (Deutscher Akademisher Austauschdienst, DAAD). More members of staff received scholarships from DAAD.

The statistics would say his best performances came in limited- overs matches, in which he took 26 wickets at an average of 22.92 and strike rate of 31.38. He twice took four-wicket hauls in this form of the game, one of which came in front of the Sky cameras against Glamorgan in 2005.

Licensed to La Selva Beach (Santa Cruz County), California, United States, the station serves the Monterey Bay Area. KOMY was originally licensed to nearby Watsonville for many years. Damage occurred to KOMY's original transmitter site as a result of the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and subsequently, new owners moved the facilities to the Santa Cruz area. KOMY is owned by the Zwerling family and originates from sister-station KSCO's 1080 AM's facilities. KOMY was acquired shortly after the Zwerlings acquired KSCO on January 31, 1991. History KOMY began in 1937 as KHUB, \\"The Hub of the Monterey Bay Area\\". KHUB became KOMY in 1957. KSCO/KOMY's studios on 2300 Portola Drive in Santa Cruz, CA  Programming format changes = Liberal talk ‚Äì 2005  In the Fall of 2005, following different music and other programming over the years, KOMY began airing a progressive talk format, becoming an Air America Radio affiliate. Thus, KOMY was considered the \\"liberal version\\" of sister-station KSCO, which primarily aired conservative programming. On June 28, 2006, KOMY dropped The Majority Report with Janeane Garofalo. According to station owner Michael Zwerling, this decision was because the show had failed to gain a single advertiser during the year that it was on the station. After three consecutive Arbitron zero ratings periods between January and November in 2006, KOMY would change formats in January 2007.  Oldies music ‚Äì 2007  On Thursday, January 25, 2007, at 10 a.m., KOMY 1340 dropped the progressive talk format and went to a 1950s/1960s 'oldies' format. For nearly two months, beginning on January 25, the original Oldies programming broadcast on the air by KOMY was fed via the Bay Area Radio Museum's Internet audio server, with custom \\"KOMY 1340\\" PAMS jingles that were freshly recorded for the station. On March 20, 2007, KOMY began 'stunting,' using construction sound effects and promoting roughly every four minutes that KOMY would return with a better signal and programming. Two days later, KOMY adopted the Jones Satellite Networks' oldies format. This format change was a return to the roots of KOMY 1340, a popular Top-40 station back in the 1960s, when it was very briefly the home of radio legend Robert W. Morgan early in his career.  Adult standards music ‚Äì 2009  In the first week of April 2009, KOMY management decided that they were no longer satisfied with Jones' oldies format, which had changed as a result of recent radio network mergers. For no more than a few days, KOMY was basically simulcasting sister station KSCO's talk programming. There was now no Oldies format station in the Monterey Bay Area AM market. Then KIDD (formerly known as 'Magic 63' ) seized on this opportunity and without notice immediately changed its format from an Adult Standards/Big Band format to an Oldies format as Oldies 630. Magic 63's listeners were quickly in an uproar over the loss of the only Standards station in the market. Recognizing a loyal listener demographic, KOMY quickly followed KIDD's change and immediately adopted a hybrid Adult Standards format. The music and formatics adopted by KOMY, including the Magic & Memories imaging, were put in place by David Jackson of the Bay Area Radio Museum, with voice imaging by KSCO/KOMY production director Bill Graff.  Current programming ‚Äì 2017  Currently, KOMY during the weekdays airs programs from the Genesis Communications Network including The Alex Jones show. in addition, the station originates the health show, \\"Dead Doctors Don't Lie\\" with Dr. Joel Wallach. On weekends, KOMY simulcasts sister station KSCO's programming. Like KSCO, KOMY relies on commissions from the sale of Wallach's nutritional supplements as its primary source of revenue.

It is very flavorful and sweet, and most often home-made. As a consequence, there is no \\"official\\" recipe for it. Everybody tunes quantities and preparation methods to suit their own taste. Vi»ôinatƒÉ is easy to make and is completely natural depending on the type of alcohol used. It is traditionally produced in small quantities, to suit a family's need. The jar is filled halfway with sour cherries and an equal amount of sugar (by weight, not volume). The mix may be left to ferment for a few days, then the rest of the jar filled with »õuica or vodka (which stops the fermentation process) and sealed. The jar is then left in a dark place at room temperature for about 100 days. Contents are rolled around occasionally during this period to encourage proper mixing, especially during fermentation. At the end, the cherries are filtered out, and the resulting sweet drink is the \\"vi»ôinata\\". The flavor will strongly depend on the quality of the fruit, therefore it is advisable to use only hand-picked, healthy, well ripened, fresh fruit, if possible from an ecologic culture, and avoid getting leaves, peduncles or pieces of branches into the jar. The maceration in alcohol will amplify any bad taste there is in the fruit, such as fruit that started to rot, instead of hiding it. Wood or leaves will release an unpleasant tannin into the drink, which will only get softer with age. Alternately, honey may be used instead of sugar. Few people do, however, since honey is more expensive, and depending on its type may not contribute in a positive way to the taste. Some production methods involve the smashing of the sour cherries before putting them in the jar. Alternatively, the kernels can be removed and broken open before being added to the jar. The inner, soft part of the kernel adds an almond-like flavor to the drink. These processes add the risk that the resulting drink will not be clear, as filtering is more difficult. Many people in Romania use single or double-distilled plum brandy (also homemade), which is not allowed to age instead of alimentary alcohol. Aging the drink improves its taste - depending on the type of alcohol used, the initial drink may feel a little rough and burning. This rough sensation can be likened to that experienced whilst consuming carbonated drinks, hence \\"vi»ôinata\\" is sometimes referred to by other cultures as \\"fizzy wine\\". The remaining sour cherries are an excellent ingredient for cakes and pies, if used soon after removal from the jar - they get wrinkled and lose flavour with time.

Kimball has also performed as a solo artist and session singer.  Early life Kimball was raised in Vinton, Louisiana, but was born in nearby Orange, Texas, as Vinton did not have a hospital. Kimball started singing as a child, dabbling on vocals and playing piano and acoustic guitar in a musical household throughout his youth - mostly covering and performing 1950s and 1960s R&B; hits, 1800s Traditional Olde Tyme music; as well as rare local Swamp pop and Cajun folk songs, typical of Louisiana. His parents were extremely supportive of his hobby of performing music and his musical talents; and devoted much interest in his opportunity to become a professional musician as full-time career by adulthood. He is of English, Cajun French, Welsh and Jewish ancestry. He graduated from McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana in 1969. Throughout the 1970s, Kimball performed as the vocalist in various New Orleans-area bands, including The Levee Band, which became LeRoux after Kimball left. Career success In 1974, Kimball moved from Louisiana to Los Angeles, California to pursue a full-time music career. In California, he joined three members of Three Dog Night to form a band called S.S. Fools. They released one album on CBS Records, which was considered a commercial failure, causing the band to be dropped from their label and to split up within a year and a half. In 1976, David Paich and Jeff Porcaro asked Kimball to join them with three other session musicians, who would eventually form Toto. He submitted a self-penned audition song for the band: \\"You Are the Flower\\", which he had written for his daughter and was later included on Toto's debut album. Paich and Porcaro were impressed by Kimball's bluesy and long-ranged vocal style and offered him the job of vocalist and songwriter. The pair liked Kimball's ability to sing in an R&B; style and to fuse it with hard rock and jazz, which was characteristic and attributed to his Louisiana origins. Kimball performed on the first four studio albums by Toto, though roughly half the songs the band recorded during this period (including a comparable share of their hits) featured other members of the group on lead vocals instead of Kimball. He was asked to leave the band in 1984 during the sessions for the Isolation album. In the late 1990s, on good terms with his former bandmates, Kimball was asked to rejoin Toto, which he again accepted. A longstanding urban legend holds that the band named itself 'Toto' after Kimball's \\"real\\" name, \\"Robert Toteaux.\\" This story was actually an in-joke perpetuated by Toto's original bassist, David Hungate - due to Kimball's home-state of Louisiana and his Cajun heritage. According to Toto guitarist Steve Lukather, the real reason for this choice of band name was that Toto was \\"Just a really simple (unpretentious) name: easy to remember and easily identifiable, in any language.\\" After Toto After splitting from Toto in 1984, Bobby Kimball relocated to Germany for a solo career under producer Frank Farian of the Far Corporation. Kimball also continued to work as a session artist, singing background vocals with a trio composed of Michael McDonald from The Doobie Brothers and Bill Champlin of Chicago. Kimball was nearly asked by the band to return to Toto during 1989‚Äì1990 to record songs for the band's greatest hits album, Past to Present 1977‚Äì1990, only to be replaced by singer Jean-Michel Byron (a decision said to have derived from Sony, the band's record company at the time). Byron was let go shortly thereafter, and guitarist-vocalist Steve Lukather took over Toto's primary lead vocal duties from 1991 to 1999. After leaving the band, Kimball released the live album Classic Toto Hits in late 1990, in which he performed various Toto songs from over the years. He recorded the album with the Frankfurt Rock Orchestra. In 1994, Kimball released his first solo album Rise Up, featuring the single \\"Woodstock\\". Return to Toto In 1998, Kimball rejoined Toto. The band then returned to the studio to record Mindfields. Toto toured in support of the album throughout 1999 and 2000. In late 1999, the band released the live album Livefields. In 1999, Kimball released his second solo album All I Ever Needed, with the single \\"Kristine\\". In 2002, Toto released a covers album Through the Looking Glass. In February 2006, Toto released Falling in Between, their first studio album of new material since 1999; however, it was announced in June 2008 that the band members had gone separate ways. When the group reformed in 2010, Kimball was not asked to return and was replaced by previous Toto vocalist Joseph Williams. Kimball hosts his own website where he offers vocal advice to aspiring singers. Kimball was involved in the Pink Floyd tribute album, Pigs and Pyramids, An All Star Lineup Performing the Songs of Pink Floyd, released in 2002. His contribution \\"Have a Cigar\\" also appeared on another Pink Floyd tribute album that year, Pink Box: Songs of Pink Floyd. Latest activities Bobby Kimball in December 2013 Kimball provided additional backing vocals on the song, \\"Caroline,\\" on the 2006 Chicago album, XXX. Kimball has toured and done concerts with many of his friends' bands around the world. In January 2010, he did fourteen concerts in Germany on the \\"Rock Meets Classic\\" Tour with the Bohemian Symphony Orchestra Prague, featuring Philipp Maier as Conductor and Music Arranger. The singers with Kimball on this tour were Lou Gramm, the original lead vocalist of Foreigner, and Dan McCafferty, from the band Nazareth. On May 16, 2010, at the LMHOF Louisiana Music Homecoming in Erwinville, Louisiana, Bobby Kimball was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Kimball recorded a progressive rock album in 2010 entitled Elements under the band name Yoso with former Yes members Tony Kaye and Billy Sherwood. Kimball recorded the 2011 album Kimball/Jamison with Jimi Jamison. In July 2011, Kimball toured Ireland with an emerging Irish band, Shadowplay. The tour visited Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Sligo, concluding in a headline performance at The Buncrana Music Festival, Ireland's largest not-for-profit music event. In November 2012, Kimball toured South America. The tour included Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Peru. In March 2013, Kimball was a special guest vocalist with the Raiding the Rock Vault classic rock tribute show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In May 2014, in Genoa, at the FIM - Fiera Internazionale della Musica, Kimball obtained from the director of the event Verdiano Vera, the FIM Award 2014 - Legend of Rock - Best Voice. In February 2015, he represented the United States at the LVI International Song Festival in Vi√±a del Mar, Chile, with the song \\"Living Your Life for Happiness\\". In late 2016, Bobby released a solo album, We're Not In Kansas Anymore,We're Not In Kansas Anymore and the same year, music website No Echo featured Kimball on their \\"Best Male AOR Singers\\" list.Best Male AOR Singers feature on NoEcho.net He has also done some guest appearances on numerous bands' recordings of late.

Leggett, Suzi Leggett, and Dr. Han Min Su., and was registered the same year in Washington D.C. as the \\"World Peace Corps Mission, World Peace Corp Academy and World Peace Prize Awarding Council, Inc.,\\" a non-profit missionary organization. The organization operates under the principles of inter-religious collaboration, and in the spirit of altruism and world peace. History Robert L. Leggett was a nine-term United States Congressman. While visiting Korea in 1961, he met Dr. Han Min Su who was an elder clergyman of the Korean Christian churches. He was also an ex-public relations officer of Pacific Air Forces, and the author of Goodbye John. The two men became friends, and Congressman Leggett continued to be inspired by the faithful Christians in Korea. Inspired by the success of the United States Peace Corps initiated by U.S. President John F. Kennedy, the two co-founded the World Peace Corp Mission as a civilian organization emulating the spirit of that program. Prize Two awards are given - the Main Prize and the Top Honor Prize. The first Top Honor Prize was awarded to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan for \\"Winning the star wars against the Russia and the UAS National stability\\". The prize is not awarded every year; the next prizes were not issued until 1995. The Top Honor Prize has been issued posthumously to Mahatma Gandhi in 2003. The prize has the stated intention to promote world peace and inter-religious understanding, and is awarded periodically to individuals considered to have contributed to the causes of world peace by preventing regional conflicts or world war; by settling the disputes of political, diplomatic and economic matters; or by developing new inventions to minimize threats and confusions within mankind. The prize's stated core spirit is to advance peace and justice and inter-religious collaborations. Controversy In 1997, the award was presented to Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, King of Tonga. The group who presented the prize also said that they were going to provide Tonga with the world's first plant that would turn sea water into natural gas, which did not materialize. The Tongan government later said that they had been scammed, and the New York Daily News expressing mystification at the \\"elaborate and, so far as anyone can see, totally pointless hoax\\". According to R.G. Crocombe, the Korean government made the Peace Corps issue an apology to Tonga. After Taiwanese Vice-President Annette Lu accepted the award in 2001, there was controversy about the World Peace Prize in the Taiwanese press. A spokesman for Lu denied that the prize was a hoax. Congressman Lester Wolff, the Chief Judge of World Peace Prize Award Council, held a press conference in Taipei where he showed what he said was a letter from the Prime Minister of Tonga apologizing for inaccuracies reported in the Tongan press. Wolff received the Top Honor Prize in 2011.

In the middle row: BlackRose, Tsukasa and Subaru. In the top: Orca, Balmung, Ova, Atoli and Fluegel. Project .hack and .hack Conglomerate are part of a Japanese multimedia franchise primarily developed by CyberConnect2, and published by Bandai. The franchise is set on an alternate history Earth, where a new version of the Internet arises following a major global computer network disaster in 2005. Central to the premise is a mystery about the wildly popular in-universe MMORPG The World. As most of the story takes place within The World, characters typically interact as their avatars. The first four video games follow a newcomer named Kite who goes on a quest to revive his comatose friend who fell into a coma after his character was killed by an unknown creature. Bee Train also produced an anime series focused on a player named Tsukasa who has no memories of his identity outside of the game and cannot leave The World. In 2006, CyberConnect2 and Bee Train produced two new series, .hack//G.U. and .hack//Roots, respectively, that involve a returning player under the name of Haseo who, after the loss of his guild, goes on a quest to find the player killer (PK) Tri-Edge who sent his friend Shino into a coma. The latest game by CyberConnect2 is .hack//Link where Tokio Kuryuu is transported into The World: RX and time-travels across the previous storylines in order to restore frozen players. .hack was conceived by CyberConnect2 with the idea of creating a fictional MMORPG in order to simulate a realistic story. The initial characters were designed by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto while later instalments involved additional artists. Critical reception to the original characters has been positive for their designs and realistic traits. The G.U. characters received mixed responses due to Haseo's antiheroic characterization but praise for his growth. Creation and design Yoshiyuki Sadamoto designed the characters from the first .hack series and remained as a supervisor for the G.U. trilogy Development for .hack began in early 2000 with the aim of shocking and surprising the player and creating a distinctive product. CyberConnect2's president Hiroshi Matsuyama played a key role in developing the concept for the series. A number of core ideas, including \\"slaying dragons or being a thief in London\\" were explored, but these were rejected in favor of an \\"offline/online game\\". The developers looked at a number of MMORPGs such as Phantasy Star Online, Ultima Online, and Final Fantasy XI for inspiration, and drew influences from the prior works of character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Neon Genesis Evangelion) and scenario writer Kazunori It≈ç (Ghost in the Shell). Matsuyama stated that the team were proud of having Sadamoto design the cast, despite his lack of previous involvement in gaming, and said that working with him was a great opportunity. It≈ç noted that casting the player into the role of a subscriber of The World creates a unique story-telling situation which draws the player deeper into the plot. Sadamoto's character designs follow the fantasy theme, drawing influence from the sword and sorcery subgenre in particular. Character designs also draw on Celtic imagery: Director Mashimo acknowledged similarities between Bear's design and William Wallace from Braveheart, an example of a Celtic warrior. All the characters are given distinctive patterns resembling tattoos, the visual representation of a fictional gameplay aspect called Wave. Seiichiro Hosokawa was the lead artist for the .hack//G.U. game trilogy. While CyberConnect2 designed the characters for .hack//G.U., Sadamoto returned as supervisor. As a result, some aesthetics from Haseo's character design featured in the original trailers were removed from the finished product. The trilogy also made a major change in distancing the protagonist, Haseo, from the player, in an effort to be more appealing to players. Main characters=The World Following is a list of the main characters from the first version of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game The World: * is an advanced AI that takes the form of a young girl whose white hair, skin, and garments give her a ghostly appearance. She is created by Harald Hoerwick to be a symbol of the daughter he could have had with his deceased lover. She is the perfect AI, and is the spirit of The World. Since her awakening by Tsukasa, she has been fleeing the clutches of Skeith, as witnessed by Orca, Kite, and several other fictional players. She is intended to take in collected player information by Data Draining the current AI control program, Morganna, who in response intentionally keeps Aura in her sleep-like state. After Morganna's plot to keep her asleep by using Tsukasa in .hack//Sign fails, Aura awakens and becomes hunted by Morganna's Phases to prevent her from developing Data Drain. Aura manages to cultivate this power into an installation book, which is acquired by Kite. Aura becomes Data Drained afterward, and is scattered throughout The World. She communicates with Kite and other in-game players through corrupted emails, which leads to the defeat of most of the Phases. During the final battle, Aura is scattered again and merges with Morganna to complete the Ultimate AI. She becomes an omnipresent yet mostly silent force within The World for some time. She later sets out to perfect herself by giving two in-game players, Shugo and Rena, chibi versions of the avatars of Kite and Blackrose in a contest, and giving birth to another AI, Zefie. This helps Shugo reach his goal of becoming a hero. Aura's eventual disappearance causes The World to decline. Consequently, the CC Corp develops Project GU to recreate her. * is the main character of the first volume of the novel .hack//AI buster and a central character in the second volume. In the fictional game, Albireo is a powerful Long Arm character class, who mostly keeps to himself as a solo-player. Outside of the game, Albireo is Kazushi Watarai, a system administrator and debugger for CC Corporation. His job is to work out any glitches in the game, and to delete any system anomalies. He hunts vagrant AI Lycoris as part of his job, though he later meets and befriends her, unaware of her true nature. With the help of newbie player Hokuto, he helps her regain various pieces of data; when completed, Lycoris realizes that she cannot exist and forces Albireo to delete her. Albireo reappears in .hack//AI buster 2, chasing after Tsukasa, though he soon runs into Macha and is rendered comatose for several months. He is forced to resign from CC Corporation as he is blamed for causing the Twilight Incident. He then meets Hokuto's player, Haruka Mizuhara, and they begin a live-in relationship. *, also referred to as Lord Balmung and \\"Balmung of the Azure Sky\\", is a legendary player of The World. He earned fame with his Blademaster character by defeating the game event One Sin, which was thought to be unbeatable, with his partner Orca, causing them to be known as \\"The Descendants of Fianna\\". Balmung received his title and white wings which allow his avatar to float and jump higher than other characters. Balmung truly loves The World and plays it very seriously, is formal and assertive in his views, and sometimes appears arrogant. He follows a strict moral code of doing good in The World, investigates disturbances, and refuses to associate with .hackers. In .hack//Legend of the Twilight, he is much more carefree with new players, though completely business-like with his associates. Doug Erholtz (.hack//Infection) * is a large, burly Blademaster. He wears relatively little clothing, and most of his body and face is covered in blue wave tattoos resembling Celtic woad.

He later becomes the guardian of An Shouji, the player behind Tsukasa, and supports her financially as she attends boarding school. * is a female Heavy Blade with a tough-as-nails attitude and can be a bit full of herself at times.

Outside the game, she is tennis player and high-school student Akira Hayami. *BT is a Wavemaster featured in .hack//Sign. Her avatar has blonde hair and dresses in light green robes. BT focuses her attention on finding the \\"Key of the Twilight\\" and seems unconcerned with Tsukasa's predicament. She often meets with Bear and Crim in The World and in person. The name BT comes from her favorite food, a BLT sandwich, but without the lettuce, which she hates.BT: \\"It's lettuce.\\" Tsukasa: \\"Lettuce?\\" BT: \\"There's not enough taste to dislike it, and there's not smell to it. Most people say that. But I dislike it because I dislike it.\\" .hack//Sign, episode 17, Conflict. Outside the game she is a former model named Machiko who works at a dispatch company in the Touhoku region. * is a Long Arm featured in .hack//Sign. His avatar is a male with spiky blue hair, a red jacket, flared red-and-yellow pants, and a wave symbol on his chest. Crim plays as a very happy-go-lucky character, easygoing and sociable. He enjoys testing his skills against strong opponents and is always ready to help anybody in need. He founded the Crimson Knights with Subaru, though he eventually leaves. He is very close to Subaru and knows that she is handicapped; it is heavily implied that they are in a romantic relationship. He is a businessman outside the game and frequently makes international business trips. *Cubia is a monster in The World, the 'opposite side' of the mystical \\"Twilight Bracelet\\", born during its creation. It constantly attempts to prevent Kite from progressing until it is finally defeated, which results in the destruction of the bracelet. .hack//XXXX features Cubia with a human avatar who befriends Kite. Cubia returns in G.U. as the anti-Epitaph, with power equal to all eight Epitaph PCs. It spreads throughout the internet, causing malfunctions worldwide. *Elk is a shy Wavemaster who only finds comfort in working with Mia, showing loyalty and concern for her as her condition worsens. He eventually accepts Kite and his companions, and they work together. In the next version of The World, , the player behind Elk, creates the Temptress. Endrance obsessively plays the game, logging off only to sleep, and is cold towards other players while interacting with a small cat which he believes to be the reincarnation of Mia. The cat is actually an AIDA feeding off his emotions. Haseo destroys the AIDA while fighting Endrance, who falls into a deep depression until he becomes connected to Haseo in a similar format, devoting his life to what he believes he owes. * is a quiet Long Arm and a romantic with a great love for flowers, which she shares with Kite. Though she seems mysterious, she is not part of the conspiracy that Kite is battling. Recruiting Gardenia in the game is optional, through reading a message board post from her \\"groupies\\" and visiting their meeting place. She resembles the character \\"Mimika\\", who Mimiru saw use \\"Ap Crystal\\" in the episode \\"Intermezzo\\", but, contrary to popular belief, is not one of the three players who controlled Mimika. * is the German programmer responsible for creating The World. He meets his unrequited love interest, Emma Wielant, at a seminar for anthroposophy.

Obsessed with completing Aura, he decides to rid himself of his physical body and become part of The World. Morganna traps Harald and restricts him to inaccessible areas, leaving him as \\"The Broken Man\\", where he loops dialogue expressing his regrets and the error he made in creating Morganna. He eventually helps Bear and his companions get on the right path to Aura, but Morganna deletes him soon afterward. Remnants in the form of a stone tablet appear to Kite, giving him clues on how to proceed, before being destroyed by Cubia. The next version of \\"The World also features remnants that appear to Haseo. * is a professional hacker of extraordinary skills both in and out of The World. She plays an edited Wavemaster (magic-using) character with a white dress with purple triangular designs and hides her eyes behind a red visor. She provides help and information to some of the main characters in the storylines, though she usually works in the background. Helba's name comes from the long lost net- distributed text, the 'Epitaph of Twilight'. She created the Net Slum from a disused town in the game, which serves as a sanctuary for Vagrant AI, trash data, and other illegal items. It is suspected that she made a brief appearance in the second episode of .hack//Liminality outside of the game as Kaoru Asaba, a strange woman who helped Yukichin. The info book .hack//analysis, which compiles various information regarding characters and The World, mentions that she is a working single mother with a little girl. * is the main character of the .hack//Games series. He plays a Twin Blade character which is kind, considerate, and courteous to those he meets, even those who hinder his quest to save the coma victims. Kite is a close school friend of Yasuhiko, who plays online as Orca, and joined The World to meet with him there. Soon after, Yasuhiko is placed in a coma by Skeith, and Kite receives the Twilight Bracelet from Aura, allowing him to Data Drain. Following clues set by Aura, Kite defeats the various Phases and Cubia, destroying the bracelet. Aura eventually gives him a new bracelet called the Dawn Bracelet. In .hack//G.U., Haseo gets a message from BlackRose which indicates that she and Kite meet each other offline and that she has feelings for him. *Marlo plays a Blademaster who has a negative personality and difficulty showing gratitude, and was a loner until he joined up with Kite. He seems to like Kite due to Kite tolerating his rotten personality. * plays a Blademaster in The World with the appearance of an anthropomorphic cat with purple fur and long rabbit-like ears. She has the strange ability to see Kite's Bracelet. While she thinks of herself as a hacker with advanced skills, she is actually an incarnation of the Phase, Macha. She is close to Elk because of Elk's resemblance to Tsukasa, a friend from the previous incarnation, and she is constantly searching for an item called \\"Aromatic Grass\\". As Kite defeats each phase, she loses her memory and begins to wander the root towns. As The World becomes more corrupt, she eventually awakens as Macha the Temptress. She is destroyed, and later revived by Aura. Mia is captured and killed after the Project G.U. ( Project Roots) staff remove the Temptress data from her. The original Macha is an AI character created by Morganna to follow Tsukasa and make sure that he never leaves the game. She eventually turns on Morganna and sacrifices herself to save Tsukasa and the others. After Macha was data-drained and killed, her data was reconfigured as Mia. Kari Wahlgren (.hack//Sign) * appears in .hack//Sign. She is a 15-year- old girl who plays a female Heavy Blade, which appears as a teenage girl dressed in an armored bikini top and a short skirt, with large greaves on her legs (an outfit similar to BlackRose's). Mimiru plays as a tanking character who is poor at planning and follow through. Nevertheless, she has a big heart with bigger attitude. She meets Tsukasa and soon gains his trust and friendship. She also teams with Bear, whom she refers to as an \\"old man\\", and spends considerable time attempting to learn his career outside of the game.

Her father works at a company that manufactures semiconductors. * is a Wavemaster character with bright pink hair and an eternally cheerful personality. She joins Kite's campaign in order to search for treasure, and plays the game for recreation with no secret agenda.

Near the end of the game, she goes \\"off-line\\" in order to give birth. *Moonstone is a Twin Blade character who is obsessed with increasing his character strength. The strong silent type, he often speaks in one-word phrases or short sentences. He has a great deal of respect for other strong characters, and is the first character to send the player his address though e-mail. * is an AI system created by Harald Hoerwick to oversee the birth of Aura by gathering personality data from The World and allowing herself to be absorbed into Aura. However, Morganna attempts to stall the growth of Aura in order to prolong her own existence, resulting in many of the events in the .hack series. In .hack//Sign, she imprisoned Tsukasa in The World and tried to use his negative emotions to prevent Aura from waking, but failed. She is able to bend her programming by succumbing to a paradox, and eventually overcomes her programming to take on the persona of the Cursed Wave from the Epitaph of Twilight. She exists everywhere in The World with the exception of glitched areas; when she is damaged, The World becomes corrupted. Unable to keep Aura sealed, Morganna tries to kill her with the Eight Phases (her creations which contain part of her data). Morganna is merged with Aura to create the Ultimate AI. * is a Twin Blade with the same model as the A-20 of .hack//Sign.

Last Recode) *Nuke Usagimaru is the host of a battle-commentary show where he tries to tackle a powerful monster solo, providing humorous commentary and physical comedy while others watch.

His closest friends in the game are Kite, who Nuke sees as the ultimate straight man and his ideal partner, and Rachel, who acts as his editor via e-mail. Nuke's character class is a Long Arm and his dress is something like that of a clown. Later, by the time of .hack//G.U., it is implied that he and Rachel have become somewhat famous. * is a high-level male Blademaster played by a fourteen-year-old boy named Yasuhiko. Orca is given the title \\"Orca of the Azure Sea\\" after beating an event thought to be unbeatable with Balmung. Orca has been known to lend his strength to fledgling players of The World. After having his friend Kite join the game, he is given the Book of Twilight by Aura due to his reputation. Orca was originally meant to be the true keeper of the Twilight Bracelet, but he is Data Drained by Skeith, leaving Yasuhiko in a coma until Kite helps complete Aura. * is a Heavy Axeman with a huge body and proportionally small head. Piros believes he is the true protagonist of the story and has an odd speech pattern. He involves Kite in his misadventures, which are usually the result of his naivety. Although he can be very childish at times, Piros is a graphics designer and programmer outside the game. *Rachel is a Blademaster who is greedy and money-obsessed, and is always scheming for ideas to make money in The World. She drags Kite into helping with her schemes, which usually fail.

Silver Knight also appears in the .hack//Legend of the Twilight anime, where he helps Shugo until his character is deleted by the Cerulean Knights. He makes a third appearance in .hack//Roots, where he offers Haseo his assistance after stating that he has been in a similar situation; Haseo refuses. * is a player who wins a special chibi version of Kite's avatar in a contest developed by Aura. He originally believes that he had outgrown video games, but after winning the contest along with his twin sister Rena, the two join The World. He lacks planning skills and has difficulty turning down the requests of others. Aura gives him a version of Kite's Twilight Bracelet that does not harm humans. Aura's plan is to motivate Shugo by allowing him to be a hero, after meeting and talking to him using another player's character in the past. *, known as Skeith, the Terror of Death, is the first Phase that Morganna creates. He absorbs Sora using Data Drain and then is sent to find Aura. His avatar appears as a humanoid seemingly made of rounded rock with floating disjointed appendages and a two-piece ring-shaped horn. Skeith carries a red staff, upon which he 'hangs' (similar to crucifixion) his victims prior to Data Draining them. He resides in an amnesiac Sora until Aura is found. Skeith seals Sora within his staff, and drains Orca which places Yasuhiko in a coma. Kite later fights and defeats Skeith. Skeith is recreated with the other Phases as part of CC Corporation's plan to reconstruct Morganna, though the plan backfires. Based on Sora's condition, the corporation gave him the ability to fuse with players. The seven Phases absorb the consciousness of their players and escape into the network. (The seventh, Tarvos, had already been stolen and hidden halfway through the plan), where they waited for the right person to \\"connect to\\". Skeith eventually becomes part of Haseo, a new character created by the player of Sora, whom Skeith had Data Drained. Haseo can use Skeith to Data Drain opponents. * is a Twin Blade player-killer who seeks out attractive female characters and attempts to obtain their addresses. Outside of the game, he is Ryou Misaki, a 10-year-old fourth-grade student. He interacts with Mimiru, who finds him to be a nuisance, and BT, who exchanges information with Sora and is often on the receiving end of his player-killer activities. Sora searches for interesting activities, which leads him to Tsukasa and the Key of the Twilight, Aura. He eventually comes into contact with Morganna and works with her until he becomes bored. She has Skeith Data Drain and absorb him, causing Misaki to fall into a coma. Skeith uses Sora's avatar, which is covered in rags and has no recollection of past events, to track down Aura.

Misaki awakes from his coma after Morganna is destroyed, and later becomes the main protagonist in .hack//G.U. as the creator of the character Haseo. * is a female Heavy Axeman with blue-green hair, a puce-colored tattoo on her forehead, and rudimentary wings on her back. She first joins The World hoping to make friends, though she knows nothing of the game and wanders around for hours.

Aura is eventually awakened, allowing Tsukasa to log out. Outside of the game, Tsukasa is a girl named , who was raised by an abusive father after the death of her mother. The abuse caused her to disassociate from her gender. After awaking from her coma, Ryo Sakuma, the player behind Bear, becomes Shouji's legal guardian and allows her to go to a boarding school. She meets with Mariko, Subaru's player, and the two begin an offline friendship. *Wiseman is a Wavemaster with a calm and collective attitude and an excellent perspective on business.

Outside of the game, he is Takumi Hino, a ten-year-old boy who enjoys collecting trading cards and playing soccer. * is a vagrant AI and Aura's daughter. She is separated from Aura and becomes attached to Shugo when she smells Aura's scent on his bracelet. She always vies for Shugo's affections and is rude to all who try to stop her.

The World R:2 The following is a list of the main characters from the second version of The World. * is an Adept Rogue \\"player killer killer\\" and the main protagonist of the .hack//G.U. video game series and the .hack//Roots anime series. He is hunted by player killers (PKs) upon entering the game until he joins with Ovan of the Twilight Brigade. Ovan eventually disappears, and Haseo's friend Shino is placed into a coma by Tri-Edge. Haseo attempts to find power, which leads him to Harald, who gives him power. He eventually tries to face Tri-Edge, though he is completely reset after being data drained. Haseo agrees to assist Yata and Pi, two system administrators of The World R:2, in their efforts to discover the reason behind recent attacks on players and a sudden increase in AIDA activity.

AIDA afflicts players in the .hack//G.U. series by attacking them and causing them to gradually become insane or for their physical bodies to fall into comas. The eight Epitaph users are partially immune to these effects and fight AIDA. The bad, viral instances of AIDA are deleted at the end of the game series, though it is stated that good instances exist, who try to exist happily. AIDA may only be stopped by the Epitaph users' ability to \\"data drain\\", an illegal program originally given to Kite by Aura, which CC Corp believes also causes AIDA. *Alkaid is a female Twin Blade known as \\"Former Emperor of the Demon Palace\\".

Kuhn implies that she broke up with him due to his immaturity. Louis Chirillo (.hack//Roots) * is a Steam Gunner who leads the Twilight Brigade. He is guarded with his personal details, excepting Shino who knows him outside the game.

Michael Kopsa (.hack//Roots) * is a legendary Player Killer, whose victims, \\"The Lost Ones\\", never log back into the game and the players are left comatose.

Outside of the game, Yata is 17-year-old Takumi Hino, who played Wavemaster Wiseman in the original .hack series, as well as the PCs Nala and Naobi. Pual Dobson (.hack//Roots) The World R:X A list of the main characters from the portable version of \\"The World\\" * is a 14-year-old boy who is very fond of games.

He is a Doubleware, a special kind of human able to use Real Digitilize technology to physically enter a virtual space. Tokio works to retrieve the Chrono Core to open the Akashic Record, forced to do so by Saika but also indebted to Kite who saved him. In 2014, during the Akashic Line's closed beta test, Tokio succeeded in rescuing an NPC to clear an event. For an instant, he was successfully Real Digitalized by Jyotaro Amagi's test program, becoming the only Doubleware to be discovered by the game. Although he did not understand this at the time, this direct contact left a lasting impression on both him and the NPC (later revealed to be AIKA). * is a transfer student in Tokio's class, who becomes famous for her excellence in academia and athletics. She tricks Tokio into playing The World R:X to retrieve the Chrono Core for her. She is secretly Jyotaro Amagi's cousin and adopted sister.

Prior to knowing her identity, Tokio referred to her as 'Princess'. She granted Tokio the X-Form, encouraging him to continue fighting for those whom he cherished. She serves as a guide throughout the game, accompanying Tokio who is the only one who can see her. In 2014, AIKA was created as an event NPC in Jyotaro Amagi's online game Akashic Line, subconsciously modelled after his late aunt Ayaka Amagi. During the game's closed beta test, Tokio rescued her to clear an event and this direct contact left a lasting impression on both him and the NPC. In 2017, she became fused with benevolent AIDA, retaining the memories of the NPC and the personality of AIDA, forming a new type of AI. She was later retrieved by Saika in order to find Jyotaro. In the final battle, AIKA sacrificed herself to purify Aura's corrupted data and disappeared. However, Helba suggested that AIKA might exist somewhere in The World. *Death Queen Aura, a.k.a.

IGN suggested that the storyline of GU could be streamlined by allowing e-mail access within The World. Despite deriding the \\"filler\\" story of Rebirth, Sullivan found Reminisce to be much more enjoyable due to its more mature storyline. Mania foud Haseo's skills useless in combat but liked his relationship with the Twilight Brigade as the cast is explored in a personal manner as the premise focuses on players interacting with each other. Both Haseo and Atoli's actors, Takahiro Sakurai and Ayako Kawasumi, were highly praised for their work in the OVA.

He played for Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Middlesex and Worcestershire.  Biography  An opening bowler, Richardson made his first-class debut for Derbyshire in 1995 and, though he did not make a contribution with the bat, his three wickets showed potential. He played one match for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship in 1998. Staffordshire received the trophy having had a better record in the qualifying tournament. He first appeared in the County Championship in 1999, for Warwickshire, and made it to the first team in 2000. Warwickshire were to finish high in the Second Division the following year, and in their return to Division One in season 2002, they were to impress greatly, finishing the season in second place. Though his bowling was minimal for the next few years, a move to Middlesex revitalised his career and proved him capable to remain fit throughout a season. Desperate to keep Middlesex in the hunt to consolidate their Division One placing, Richardson played solidly throughout season 2005, though he played only one match in 2006. Richardson was a tailend batsman for the Warwickshire team and continued in this role with Middlesex. At the end of the 2009 season, having only played six County Championship games for Middlesex, Richardson signed for Worcestershire on a two-year contract. He was offered a coaching/playing role at Middlesex but expressed his desire to continue playing nearer to home. In 2012, Richardson was named one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the 2011 season. In nine days in May 2013 he took 24 wickets in consecutive matches: 5 for 41 and 7 for 22 against Kent at Canterbury,Kent v Worcestershire 2013 then 8 for 37 and 4 for 70 against Gloucestershire at Worcester,Worcestershire v Gloucestershire 2013 for combined figures of 84.2‚Äì29‚Äì170‚Äì24. On 6 January 2014, Richardson announced his retirement from cricket to become Warwickshire's new bowling coach. Richardson is a lifelong fan of Stoke City Football Club.

The series has been translated to English and published in the United States by NBM Publishing. The issues are published in a large format (19 cm by 25.4 cm) as soft cover graphic novels. Issues 1 through 3 were published individually. Issues 4/5 and 6/7 were published together as single books. NBM Publishing have stated that they will not be publishing the remainder of the series in English in the United States. Wake is space opera,Jean-David Morvan bio at DupuisKelvin Green, Top 5 of 2005 (Part 1) exploring social themes about inequalities, corruption and colonisation.  Origin  The foreword to the art book 1000 Nav√Øs states that the series was conceived at the prompting of publisher Guy Delcourt, who wanted a space opera to add to his catalogue. Jean David Morvan presented the name Sillage to Philippe Buchet, who conceived of the space convoy, but made them entirely alien to avoid comparisons to Battlestar Galactica. Similarly, the main character was made female to avoid comparisons to Tarzan.Buchet, Philippe (2007). 1000 Nav√Øs, p. 4. Editions Delcourt, Paris. .  Protagonist  Navee in the censored American version compared to the original art; here the Finnish translation The protagonist of the series is Navee (N√§vis in the original French), a young human female who was shipwrecked and orphaned on an alien planet. She was raised from infancy by one of the ship's robots, Nsob, and has never met another human being. The series uses Navee as an outside viewer of the Wake convoy as she adjusts to life in this alien civilisation. The first volume of the series depicts the adolescent Navee topless. As a prerequisite for publication in the United States, the American publisher covered her breasts with a black felt marker in the American edition. Navee is the only living example of humanity known to Wake. She is also unique in being neither a \\"psi active\\" nor a \\"psi passive\\"; that is, she has no telepathic abilities, but her mind cannot be read either. This lack of psionic talent of any sort comes in handy at times during the series. Navee has white rectangular tattoos on her body. There is evidence to suggest she is not a true human being and these markings have something to do with it (Wake Vol 3;N√§vis Vol 2&4). As the series begins, Navee has survived into adolescence and all the technology on her wrecked ship has finally failed. She lives a primitive life in the jungle of her world with her companion Houyo, a sentient tiger-like being. Her idyllic life ends when agents of Wake, a traveling civilization of many different alien species, arrives to Hotta-form (analogous to terraform) her planet for Hottard colonisation. Prior to encountering Navee, Wake had extremely limited contact with humanity. After some first contact friction, Navee is awarded salvage rights to her wrecked spacecraft and joins Wake with enough money to pay for her education and to commission a custom spacecraft for her to live in. When her money runs out, she goes to work for the Wake government as an agent and explorer within the Wake convoy and on technologically primitive worlds.  Wake  The Wake Civilization is a vast convoy of spacecraft that constantly travel around the galaxy in search of resources, races, and technology. This convoy drops hypergates as it travels, allowing instantaneous access to previously visited star systems. It is unclear whether Wake has any faster than light capability beyond the hypergates. The Wake civilization is very old. There are hints that it has circled the galaxy many times, and revisited many stellar systems over time periods sufficient to watch civilizations rise and fall. There is also evidence that Wake has terraformed planets and seeded life on them over a very long period of time. As a synthesis of vast numbers of races with a long history, Wake is extremely advanced technologically. No two ships of Wake are designed the same, and some are clearly biological. Several ships and species are encountered in the convoy that are so different that communication is difficult or impossible, yet they are clearly a part of the civilization. Artificial intelligences are used everywhere, but are considered second class citizens and kept under control by the biological citizens. Advanced biological information storage and processing technologies are seen several times throughout the series. The communication technology of Wake relies heavily on psionics, produced and manipulated by both biological and technological means. The citizens of Wake are classified by their ability to control the behavior of other beings through psionic powers and their susceptibility to control by the same means. This division of people into powerful and helpless categories is a consistent theme throughout the series. The exclusive use of psionics for communication is hinted at as one of the possible reasons why Wake and humanity have never discovered each other, as N√§vis and presumably all humans are totally immune to psionic coercion and equally unable to manipulate or communicate with other beings through these means. This ability makes N√§vis valuable as an intelligence agent of Wake's military, and use of this talent allows her to make a living.  Series style and subgenres  In an interview or commentary published in bilingual form (English and French) in a collection of his drawings (blockBuster, 2005) Buchet noted that science fiction had the peculiarity of \\"allowing a natural journey between past and future\\". The science fiction traditions of cryogenics and social manipulation at a grand scale made it possible for him and Morvan to explore the subgenre of steampunk in \\"gearing up\\", while the tradition of barbaric pre-industrial planets made an exploration of \\"sword and sorcery\\" possible in The sign of the Demons, and so on.

It is situated halfway between Como and Milan. The ancient historical center of the town was founded on the top of a hill situated in the valley on the right bank of Lura. The municipal territory contains a large portion of the Lura Park. Lomazzo received the title of Citt√† (City) with a presidential decree on July 11, 2006. Lomazzo borders the following municipalities: Bregnano, Cadorago, Cirimido, Guanzate, Rovellasca, Rovello Porro, Turate History For more than one thousand years, the central street of Lomazzo has been the political and religious border that cut the town in two parts, from south to the north. The communal administration was divided as well, so the town of Lomazzo was governed separately by two municipalities: Lomazzo Comasco (parish of San Siro, also called Lomazzo di Sotto or, in dialect, Lumazz de Sott) and Lomazzo Milanese (parish of San Vito, also called Lomazzo di Sopra or Lumazz de Sura). In the Middle Ages the border between the communes of Como and Milan already passed through Lomazzo. Still in the 16th century the custom duties were collected at the passage of Lomazzo border, for the feudal rights granted to the Carcano family by the Spaniards, who at the time controlled the Duchy of Milan. The division of Lomazzo originated during the barbarian invasions. The Lombards settled down near the existing inhabited nucleus, remaining separate from the existing community so they could practice their Arian religion. Probably, when they were converted to Catholicism, they maintained a separate church. The missionaries were sent from towns of the diocese of Milan, so the first community continued to be in the diocese of Como and the new community remained faithful to the diocese of Milan. Ghibelline Como and Guelph Milan warred bitterly during the medieval period. This conflict was contemporary with the war between the Lombardy free cities and the Holy Roman emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Due to its double administration, the town of Lomazzo was always declared neutral ground by the two factions. After the wars, the ambassadors met here and here they proclaimed the peaces. The first peace treaty was signed in 1249, but war renewed and years of disagreement continued. In 1282, Giovanni De Avvogadri, expelled by the Ghibellines from his bishopric in Come, excommunicated them from Lomazzo, starting the war between Como and Milan. In 1286, after four years of intense war, representatives of the republics of Lombardy and of northern-Italy free cities, arrived to Lomazzo to sign the Peace of Lomazzo, at the presence of Loterio Rusca, Lord of Como, and Ottone Visconti, Lord of Milan. Reunion The civil union of Lomazzo was completed in 1816, when the Austrian puppet state of Lombardy-Venetia unified the two communities of Lomazzo Comasco and Milanese to become the single municipality of Lomazzo. The two parishes were also unified in 1981 under the bishopric of Como.

KCNW is owned by Wilkins Communication Network and the broadcast license is held by Kansas City Radio, Inc. In the 1960s, 1380 AM was home to a Top-40 station, KUDL. In 1973, the Top-40 format jumped to FM and eventually became a soft adult contemporary station, while 1380 housed an oldies format for two years. The KCNW letters (Kansas City's News World) were adopted shortly after a news format debuted with programming from the short-lived \\"News and Information Service\\" based at NBC Radio. Although following the lead of other AM stations dumping music for talk (notable KQV in Pittsburgh the same year), the news format didn't last long in Kansas City. In 1978, KCNW started broadcasting religious programming, yielding the acronym Kansas City's New Way.

Scott began to work on his batting and progressed through the Middlesex Colts Age groups before signing for the Middlesex. A lack of opportunities meant that he crossed the Thames and moved to Middlesex's local rivals Surrey for one season, where he was behind Jonathan Batty as first choice wicket-keeper. Middlesex return Scott moved back to Middlesex in 2004. Scott had had limited wicket-keeping opportunities, prior to the absence of David Nash due to an injury in 2004. During this time, he claimed his first century against Northamptonshire. He made 50 dismissals in 2005, ensuring Middlesex avoided relegation. During the 2008 season Scott was the wicketkeeper and began to find some form with the bat climbing up the Batting order. Middlesex won the T20 Cup and were invited to play in the West Indies in the Stanford Series. Scott's Nephew Joel Pope is following in his footsteps from Wycombe House onto the County Cricket Circuit, beginning his career with Leicestershire County Cricket Club. Scott was selected for the England Lions tour of New Zealand in February 2009.

The Capitals played out of Royal Athletic Park and led the league in attendance, averaging over 1,000 fans per game. They featured former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Steve Sinclair and were managed by former Atlanta Braves shortstop Andres Thomas. Due to a highly receptive community, the Capitals were able to attract fans by combining local business sponsorship with affordable family entertainment. Unfortunately, the other teams in the league did not receive such a response. The league was forced to halt play in the middle of the 2003 season after new league owner Jeff Mallett (part owner of the San Francisco Giants and co- founder of Yahoo) decided the league business model was destined for failure. Although the intent was to restart the league in 2004, the league's assets were eventually sold off and play was never resumed. In 2004, the Victoria Royals were formed and featured some of the players and management of the Capitals. Unlike the Capitals, the Royals were a semi-pro team featuring college players from both Canada and the United States. There was a strong local presence, as many of the players and coaches were originally from Victoria. Local players included Curtis Pelletier, Matt Gunning, Steve Bailey, Kyle Swenson, Joel Perkins, Christian Winstanley, Graham Campbell, Bryan Allen, Gautam Srivastava, Henry Mabee, Bobby Rebner and Shawn Loglisci. Coached by Marty Hall and Daryn Lansdell, the Royals had a good season winning the PWL crown. Also, unlike the Capitals, the Royals finished their season, playing teams from Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta. At the end of the season, management decided that the return of the Royals was unlikely for 2005, due to lack of support from the local business community. Since the end of the season in 2004, Victoria has been without high-level baseball; however, that is set to change in 2009 with the arrival of the Golden Baseball League's Victoria Seals.

Technologies There are three basic technologies currently available, described below. Self-supporting The origins of the commercial self- supporting run-flat tire started in 1935 with a tire that had a fabric inner tire. The tire was advertised as a protection against blow outs, a common and dangerous occurrence in the 1930s. In 1934, Michelin introduced a tire that was based on technology developed for local commuter trains and trolleys. It had a safety rim inside the tire which if punctured would run on a special foam lining. The tire was sold for military use and for specialized vehicles like bank armoured cars. It was advertised as \\"semi-bulletproof\\". While the tire performed as advertised it was far too expensive to be a feasible option for most private automobile users. In 1958, Chrysler teamed with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to offer Captive Air run-flat tires using an interlining to carry the weight. In 1972 Dunlop launched the Total Mobility Tyre (later Denovo) \\"fail-safe\\" wheel and tire system that became optional equipment on the Rover P6 3500 in 1973, and by 1983 evolved into the TD/Denloc which became standard equipment across the whole Austin Metro range. Most recently, Bridgestone and Pirelli run-flat tires are supplied on some new model BMW cars. The automaker promoted these as a safety feature and as an alternative to carrying a spare tire. Cut-Out View of PZT Tire Pressure Zero Tire (PZT)Pressure Zero Tire: American Engineering Group wins award for its zero pressure tire http://www.tractionnews.com/american-engineering-group-wins- award-zero-pressure-tire-technology/ was pioneered by American Engineering Group (AEG) for US Special Forces. AEG prototype dissipates heat and has the tire flexibility and strength to support the heavy military pick-up weight while providing a relatively smooth ride. The durability characteristics of this design were studied further on four different tire sizes for ATV Polaris, Toyota Hilux, and Toyota Land Cruiser & GMV 1.1. special operations vehicles. Self-supporting run-flat tires are now common on light trucks and passenger cars and typically provide for the vehicle to drive for at around . However, if the tires are subject to this kind of misuse, wheels may become damaged in the process, and repair may be impossible or unsafe, especially if the tire is punctured in the sidewall or at the edge of the tread. These tires carry a 20% to 40% weight penalty over similar standard tires and the thicker sidewall also means higher rolling resistance, which reduces the vehicle's fuel economy. However, the weight penalty of the individual tire is usually more than compensated by the fact that the vehicle need no longer carry a spare, as well as the equipment needed to swap in the spare. The thicker sidewall however results in more road imperfections filtering through the tire to the rim and hence to the car, which results in a harsher ride. Self-sealing These tires contain an extra lining within the tire that self-seals in the event of a small hole due to a nail or screw. In this way, the loss of air is prevented from the outset such that the tire is either permanently self- repairing or at least loses air very slowly. There are also a number of retrofitted tire sealants which act in a similar way to self-sealing tires. These compounds are normally injected through the tire valve. The rotating force then distributes the compound onto the inner surface of the tire to act as a self-sealing lining within the tire. Auxiliary-supported Run-flat tire with support ring In this system, there is an additional support ring or insert attached to the wheel that can support the weight of the vehicle in the event of a loss of pressure. The run-flat insert has an unsurpassed ability to carry heavy vehicle loads for long distances at high speeds. It is therefore the normal run-flat selection for military vehicles, high-level executive protection vehicles, and \\"armored\\" vehiclesTest Operations Procedure (TOP) 02-2-698 Runflat Testing.-U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command. - 2015. used by government, aid groups, or private contractors in conflict zones. Standards of performance The basic benefit of using run-flat tires is continued mobility in case of a loss of air pressure, due either to a 'normal' puncture or to a hostile deliberate act including a bullet strike while the vehicle is traveling at high speed. Performance criteria are therefore in terms of distance and speed at which the vehicle can escape without becoming immobile and the steering control over the vehicle during this process. The usual standard of performance, especially for military or security vehicles, are the Finabel standards. Market share Run-flat tires accounted for less than 1% of replacement tire sales in the U.S. in 2005. In 2006, it was expected that such tires would gain popularity with armored vehicle manufacturers, but growth figures were slow with one major model, the Michelin PAX System, no longer being developed by the manufacturer (though replacements will be produced for the foreseeable future). A Michelin study released in 2008 found that 3% of drivers worldwide want run-flat tires. U.S. market share is well below 1%. American Honda Motor Co. announced that the 2009 Honda Odyssey Touring and Acura RL were its last models available with run-flat tires and with Honda no longer using run-flats. This leaves only a handful of volume manufacturers offering them as standard fittings and only on some models. An exception is BMW, who are the largest fitter of run-flats as original equipment. Former US President Barack Obama's presidential limo, \\"the Beast\\", had Goodyear Kevlar lined run-flat tires. Factors contributing to small market share The cost can be more than double other tires of comparable size. Also, run-flat tires cannot be run flat if the flat is due to sidewall damage, a common cause of flats. Also, under the best circumstances, the speed and range that the run-flat tires can be run flat is very limited. Run-flat tires cannot be driven over 50 miles per hour and usually offer only up to 50 miles of extended mobility. These limitations lower the value of the extra expense for many buyers. In certain applications, depending on the vehicle, specific tire design, and driving surface, a run-flat tire can provide from 25 miles to 200 miles driving while flat with limited speed. For Goodyear Tire, one effect on market share is the policy to prohibit the repair of tires punctured by nails or other road hazards. While Goodyear tires can be repaired, the manufacturer's warranty and liability is voided.

Specifically, if one describes the probability density as a heterogeneous fluid, then the probability current is the rate of flow of this fluid. This is analogous to mass currents in hydrodynamics and electric currents in electromagnetism. It is a real vector, like electric current density. The concept of a probability current is a useful formalism in quantum mechanics. The probability current is invariant under Gauge Transformation.  Definition (non-relativistic 3-current) = Free spin-0 particle  In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the probability current j of the wave function \\\\Psi in one dimension is defined as Quantum Field Theory, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2008, : j = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi}\\\\left(\\\\Psi^* \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi }{\\\\partial x}- \\\\Psi \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi^* }{\\\\partial x} \\\\right) , where \\\\Psi^* denotes the complex conjugate of the wave function, proportional to a Wronskian W(\\\\Psi,\\\\Psi^*). In three dimensions, this generalizes to :\\\\mathbf j = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi}\\\\left( \\\\Psi^* \\\\mathbf abla \\\\Psi - \\\\Psi \\\\mathbf abla \\\\Psi^{*} \\\\right) \\\\,, where ƒß is the reduced Planck constant, m is the particle's mass, Œ® is the wavefunction, and ‚àá denotes the del or gradient operator. This can be simplified in terms of the kinetic momentum operator, :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} = -i\\\\hbar abla to obtain :\\\\mathbf j = \\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left(\\\\Psi^* \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi - \\\\Psi \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi^*\\\\right)\\\\,. These definitions use the position basis (i.e. for a wavefunction in position space), but momentum space is possible.  Spin-0 particle in an electromagnetic field  The above definition should be modified for a system in an external electromagnetic field. In SI units, a charged particle of mass m and electric charge q includes a term due to the interaction with the electromagnetic field;Quantum mechanics, Ballentine, Leslie E, Vol. 280, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1990. :\\\\mathbf j = \\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\Psi^* \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi - \\\\Psi \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi^*\\\\right) - q\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\Psi^2 \\\\right]\\\\,! where A = A(r, t) is the magnetic potential (aka \\"A-field\\"). The term qA has dimensions of momentum. Note that \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} = -i\\\\hbar abla used here is the canonical momentum and is not gauge invariant, unlike the kinetic momentum operator \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{P}} = -i\\\\hbar abla-q\\\\mathbf{A}. In Gaussian units: :\\\\mathbf j = \\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\Psi^* \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi - \\\\Psi \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi^*\\\\right) - \\\\frac{q}{c} \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\Psi^2 \\\\right]\\\\,! where c is the speed of light.  Spin-s particle in an electromagnetic field  If the particle has spin, it has a corresponding magnetic moment, so an extra term needs to be added incorporating the spin interaction with the electromagnetic field. In SI units:Quantum mechanics, E. Zaarur, Y. Peleg, R. Pnini, Schaum‚Äôs Easy Outlines Crash Course, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, :\\\\mathbf j = \\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\Psi^* \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi - \\\\Psi \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{p}} \\\\Psi^*\\\\right) - 2q\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\Psi^2 \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\mu_S}{s} abla\\\\times(\\\\Psi^* \\\\mathbf{S}\\\\Psi) \\\\,! where S is the spin vector of the particle with corresponding spin magnetic moment ŒºS and spin quantum number s.

Connection with classical mechanics  The wave function can also be written in the complex exponential (polar) form:Analytical Mechanics, L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, :\\\\Psi = R e^{i S / \\\\hbar } where R and S are real functions of r and t. Written this way, the probability density is : \\\\rho = \\\\Psi^* \\\\Psi = R^2 and the probability current is: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{j} & = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi}\\\\left(\\\\Psi^{*} \\\\mathbf{ abla} \\\\Psi - \\\\Psi \\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\Psi^{*} \\\\right) [5pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi}\\\\left(R e^{-i S / \\\\hbar } \\\\mathbf{ abla}R e^{i S / \\\\hbar } - R e^{i S / \\\\hbar } \\\\mathbf{ abla}R e^{-i S / \\\\hbar }\\\\right) [5pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi}\\\\left[ R e^{-i S / \\\\hbar } (e^{i S / \\\\hbar } \\\\mathbf{ abla}R + \\\\frac {i}{\\\\hbar}R e^{i S / \\\\hbar } \\\\mathbf{ abla}S ) - R e^{i S / \\\\hbar } (e^{-i S / \\\\hbar } \\\\mathbf{ abla}R - \\\\frac {i}{\\\\hbar} R e^{-i S / \\\\hbar } \\\\mathbf{ abla} S )\\\\right]. \\\\end{align} The exponentials and R‚àáR terms cancel: : = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi}\\\\left[\\\\frac {i}{\\\\hbar} R^2 \\\\mathbf{ abla} S + \\\\frac {i}{\\\\hbar} R^2 \\\\mathbf{ abla} S \\\\right]. Finally, combining and cancelling the constants, and replacing R2 with œÅ, :\\\\mathbf{j} = \\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{ abla} S}{m}. If we take the familiar formula for the current: :\\\\mathbf{j} = \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}, where v is the velocity of the particle (also the group velocity of the wave), we can associate the velocity with ‚àáS/m, which is the same as equating ‚àáS with the classical momentum p = mv. This interpretation fits with Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi theory, in which : \\\\mathbf{p} = abla S in Cartesian coordinates is given by ‚àáS, where S is Hamilton's principal function.  Motivation = Continuity equation for quantum mechanics  The definition of probability current and Schr√∂dinger's equation can be used to derive the continuity equation, which has exactly the same forms as those for hydrodynamics and electromagnetism:Quantum Mechanics, E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf j = 0 where the probability density \\\\rho\\\\, is defined as :\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\Psi^2 = \\\\Psi^*(\\\\mathbf{r},t)\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) \\\\,. If one were to integrate both sides of the continuity equation with respect to volume, so that :\\\\int_V \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi^2}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right) \\\\mathrm{d}V + \\\\int_V \\\\left( \\\\mathbf abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf j \\\\right) \\\\mathrm{d}V = 0 then the divergence theorem implies the continuity equation is equivalent to the integral equation : where the V is any volume and S is the boundary of V. This is the conservation law for probability in quantum mechanics. In particular, if Œ® is a wavefunction describing a single particle, the integral in the first term of the preceding equation, sans time derivative, is the probability of obtaining a value within V when the position of the particle is measured. The second term is then the rate at which probability is flowing out of the volume V. Altogether the equation states that the time derivative of the probability of the particle being measured in V is equal to the rate at which probability flows into V.  Transmission and reflection through potentials  In regions where a step potential or potential barrier occurs, the probability current is related to the transmission and reflection coefficients, respectively T and R; they measure the extent the particles reflect from the potential barrier or are transmitted through it. Both satisfy: :T+R=1\\\\,, where T and R can be defined by: : T= \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{trans}}{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{inc}} \\\\, , \\\\quad R = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{ref}}{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{inc}} \\\\, , where jinc, jref and jtrans are the incident, reflected and transmitted probability currents respectively, and the vertical bars indicate the magnitudes of the current vectors. The relation between T and R can be obtained from probability conservation: :\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{trans} + \\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{ref}=\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{inc}\\\\,. In terms of a unit vector n normal to the barrier, these are equivalently: : T= \\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{trans}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}}{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{inc}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}}\\\\right\\\\,, \\\\qquad R= \\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{ref}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}}{\\\\mathbf{j}_\\\\mathrm{inc}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\right \\\\,, where the absolute values are required to prevent T and R being negative.  Examples = Plane wave  For a plane wave propagating in space: : \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\, A e^{ i (\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf{r}} - \\\\omega t)} the probability density is constant everywhere; : \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = A^2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi^2}{\\\\partial t} = 0 (that is, plane waves are stationary states) but the probability current is nonzero ‚Äì the square of the absolute amplitude of the wave times the particle's speed; : \\\\mathbf{j}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r},t\\\\right) = \\\\leftA\\\\right^2 {\\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\over m} = \\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}}{m} = \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v} illustrating that the particle may be in motion even if its spatial probability density has no explicit time dependence.  Particle in a box  For a particle in a box, in one spatial dimension and of length L, confined to the region; :0 < x < L\\\\,! the energy eigenstates are :\\\\Psi_n = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{L}} \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\frac{n\\\\pi}{L} x \\\\right) and zero elsewhere. The associated probability currents are :j_n = \\\\frac{i\\\\hbar}{2m}\\\\left( \\\\Psi_n^* \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi_n}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\Psi_n \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi_n^*}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right) = 0 since :\\\\Psi_n = \\\\Psi_n^*  Discrete definition  For a particle in one dimension on \\\\ell^2\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\right), we have the Hamiltonian H=-\\\\Delta+V where -\\\\Delta\\\\equiv2 I-S-S^\\\\ast is the discrete Laplacian, with S being the right shift operator on \\\\ell^2\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\right). Then the probability current is defined as j \\\\equiv 2 \\\\Im{\\\\bar{\\\\Psi} i v \\\\Psi}, with v the velocity operator, equal to v\\\\equiv-i[X,\\\\,H] and X is the position operator on \\\\ell^2\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\right). Since V is usually a multiplication operator on \\\\ell^2\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\right), we get to safely write -i[X,\\\\,H]=-i[X,\\\\,-\\\\Delta]=-i\\\\left[X,\\\\,-S-S^{\\\\ast}\\\\right]=i S-i S^{\\\\ast}. As a result, we find: j\\\\left(x\\\\right)\\\\equiv 2 \\\\Im{\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x) i v \\\\Psi(x)}=2 \\\\Im{\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x) \\\\left((-S\\\\Psi)(x)+(S^\\\\ast \\\\Psi)(x)\\\\right) }=2 \\\\Im{\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x) \\\\left(-\\\\Psi(x-1)+\\\\Psi(x+1)\\\\right)}  References  * Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium bowler, who has represented Middlesex and Worcestershire. He came through the ranks at Sefton Park CC, taking a 1st XI hat-trick at Lytham aged 16,http://www.ldcc.org.uk/1st_ECB_PL_2002_057_10_290602_Lytham_v_Sefton_Park.htm and scored a record 177 not out for his school, St Margaret's, in an under-15 final. Whelan played for Middlesex's second team in 2003, but made his List A debut on 2 September 2004, when he appeared against Sussex in a totesport League game at Hove. In a crushing 135-run defeat, Whelan's success was very limited: he returned an analysis of 7‚Äì0‚Äì40‚Äì0 and scored 6 at the bottom of the order (by which time Middlesex's cause had long since been lost). Early in 2005, Whelan was named by the Liverpool Echo as Merseyside Young Sports Personality of the Year. He was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he had been encouraged by John Emburey. In early May, he made his first-class debut in a County Championship match against Hampshire at Southampton, and took three wickets. His first victim was Zimbabwe international Sean Ervine, whose wicket he claimed in both innings. He also turned out against Cambridge UCCE at the start of June, but made no other first-team appearances that season. In 2006 Whelan made a solitary List A appearance, this coming against Nottinghamshire. The following summer he managed three List A games and one first-class outing against Oxford UCCE, though he never managed more than two wickets in an innings. After the 2007 season, he left Middlesex and moved to Worcestershire. He told the Liverpool Echo in 2008 that he had become \\"stale\\" at Middlesex, and that he had thought the county \\"a very political place with a lot of favourites around the dressing room.\\" Whelan enjoyed an immediate run in the Worcestershire first team in first-class and one-day cricket. Although he again could not claim more than two wickets in any innings, on his return to the second team for the local derby with Warwickshire seconds, he produced an outstanding performance. Whelan took 6‚Äì79 in the first innings, then followed that up with 6‚Äì22 (for match figures of 12‚Äì101) to help dismiss Warwickshire for a mere 77 and set up a 53-run Worcestershire victory. Whelan then returned to first-team action, and in June returned his best List A figures of 4‚Äì78 against the New Zealanders at Worcester.

Early years Colbert began acting when he was a soldier based on the Japanese island of Okinawa. He was a clerk typist with a Military Police unit and also worked as a disc jockey for radio station KSBK-AM in the evenings. A woman in Air Force Special Services heard his voice and recruited him to act in a performance of The Caine Mutiny Court- Martial.p.50 Weaver, Tom I Talked with a Zombie Robert Colbert Interview 2008 McFarland Hooked on acting, Colbert returned to the United States and performed on stage, where he was noticed by Mickey Shaughnessy, who recommended him to a talent agency. He gained acting experience with the Portland (Oregon) Repertory Theater. Film and television career=Warner Bros. and Maverick Colbert appeared in a number of minor films, including Have Rocket, Will Travel, and was signed to a contract with Warner Brothers and subsequently cast in the feature film A Fever in the Blood (1961) along with many guest appearances on television series. In 1960, he appeared in three episodes of the ABC/WB western, Colt .45, including the episode \\"Showdown at Goldtown\\". Colbert plays Johnny Moore, a young ex-convict. Colbert also appeared as Bill Mannix in another 1960 Colt .45 episode, \\"Strange Encounter.\\" On October 28, 1960, Colbert was cast as Army Corporal Howie Burch in the episode \\"Two Trails to Santa Fe\\" of the ABC/WB western series Cheyenne. Colbert's first appearance in Maverick was in the fourth season, in \\"Hadley's Hunters,\\" playing a character called \\"Cherokee Dan Evans.\\" Later that same season, in 1961, Colbert was forced by Warner Brothers to dress exactly as lookalike James Garner had in Garner's earlier role of Bret Maverick to play a new series regular called Brent Maverick. Thinking of the inevitable comparisons to Garner that were bound to ensue, Colbert said to his bosses, \\"Put me in a dress and call me Brenda, but don't do this to me!\\" Garner had been a huge success in the role and was in the process of moving into a much-anticipated theatrical movie career in the wake of winning a contentious lawsuit with Warner Brothers. Colbert played his part in two episodes and was not called back for the following season since the studio, facing a steep ratings decline after the departures of writer/producer Roy Huggins and star Garner, decided to alternate new episodes featuring only Bret and Brent's brother Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) with reruns from earlier seasons starring Garner during the series' fifth and final season. Colbert, whose only two episodes as Brent Maverick were \\"The Forbidden City\\" and \\"Benefit of Doubt,\\" had never received enough screen time to see if he could have eventually succeeded in bolstering the ratings. Before Roger Moore, who played Bart's cousin Beau Maverick, left Maverick during the same season in which Colbert appeared, the studio shot numerous publicity photographs of Colbert, Kelly and Moore cavorting in costume together that are readily accessible on Google Images; the rights to many of the pictures are currently owned by Getty Images. By the time Colbert's two episodes were telecast, however, Moore had already quit the show and Moore and Colbert never appeared together in the series itself. James Garner reminisced in his Archive of American Television interview that the studio lit Colbert darkly as well as dressing him like Garner in an attempt to mislead the public that Garner had returned but that when Colbert spoke, the audience realized that it wasn't Garner. A viewing of the episodes themselves, however, reveals that Garner was mistaken about this and that Colbert was lit normally during his shows although he was certainly dressed precisely as Garner had been earlier in the series. In 1962 Colbert appeared as Miles Kroeger on the TV western The Virginian on the episode titled \\"Impasse.\\" In 1962, Colbert played Lonzo Green in the episode \\"Footlights\\" of the ABC/WB crime drama, The Roaring 20s. Moreover, he guest starred on most of the ABC/WB series, including 77 Sunset Strip and Hawaiian Eye (seven times each), Bronco (six times), Bourbon Street Beat (three times), Sugarfoot, The Alaskans with Roger Moore, and Surfside 6 (twice each), and Cheyenne and Lawman, once each. Colbert was cast as Andy Carter, a pioneer who retrieves for sale cast-off items from wagon trains, in the 1964 episode, \\"A Bargain Is for Keeping\\", on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days. Because of a business problem, Colbert requested Warner Bros.

Colbert made an unsuccessful 1964 television pilot for MGM Television playing the title role of The Mayor. In 1965, he made two guest appearances on Perry Mason as Deputy District Attorney Snell; first in \\"The Case of the Grinning Gorilla,\\" then in \\"The Case of the Hasty Honeymooner.\\" That same year, Colbert guest-starred in an episode of Bonanza, \\"The Meredith Smith\\", in which he appeared dressed almost exactly as he had as Brent Maverick only in full color with a bright blue hatband. In the episode he portrays a man called Ace Jones, who claims to be Meredith Smith, the heir of a large estate. Colbert's agent arranged a meeting with Irwin Allen. In 1966-1967, Colbert played the part of Doug Phillips in thirty episodes of the Irwin Allen science fiction ABC series, The Time Tunnel, the second lead in a show about two time travelers. James Darren and Lee Meriwether starred with Colbert. Historical events like the Alamo, the Titanic, Krakatoa, and Custer's last stand were fictionalized. Colbert later starred in a 1970 unsuccessful television pilot for Allen entitled City Beneath the Sea that was shown as a television movie. In 1968, Colbert appeared in the final episode of the first season of Hawaii Five-O. Colbert also appeared as the character Stuart Brooks on the television soap opera, The Young and the Restless, from March 1973 to March 1983, being honored at the show's tenth anniversary. Also, in 1973, he made a brief appearance in the Mannix episode, \\"Little Girl Lost\\", where he appeared as the victim of a murder. In 1981, Colbert and Robert Culp were suggested by CBS as possible replacements for Larry Hagman on Dallas after Hagman decided to hold out for more money; however, Hagman returned to the series. In 1987, he appeared in the film parody Amazon Women on the Moon. Personal life Colbert was married to dancer/songwriter Dotty Harmony in 1961 for 15 years. Harmony wrote for Metric Music with Sharon Sheeley and had songs recorded by Rick Nelson. They have two children, Cami and Clay. Cami is married to filmmaker Jon Freeman (Flesh Wound Films), who produces the highly successful \\"Crusty Demon\\" series of DVDs. Colbert is retired, though he still makes occasional cameo appearances, takes part in science fiction conventions and Western conventions all across America, and participates in celebrity golf tournaments for fundraising events.

It is 55 minutes long. Synopsis The area was originally considered worthless by European-Australian settlers, who fenced it off and abandoned it. The town was established around the start of the 20th century by German immigrant settlers. Its population increased after the first and second World Wars due to the government's policies of subsidies to encourage settlement by veterans. The people of Rainbow have struggled to eke out an existence for more than three generations, with global economics and government policy compounding the difficulties of marginal farming. The film draws from home movies from the 1940s to portray the people in this town.

Its alumni include politicians, bishops, writers, activists, and academics. It was founded in 1822 by Thomas Burgess, Bishop of St Davids, and given its royal charter by George IV in 1828. The college was originally intended for the teaching of Welsh male clergy, with a 1927 report estimating that 66% of Welsh clergy had received some amount of training in Lampeter. It later began teaching a range of subjects. From the world of clergy, the college's alumni include seven Archdeacons (George Austin, Carl Cooper, Owen Evans, Judy French, John Griffiths, John Holliman and Lawrence Thomas), several bishops, and one Archbishop of Wales (Alwyn Rice Jones). The list of educators includes a President of Washington & Jefferson College (John C. Knapp) and a Vice- Chancellor of Edge Hill University (John Cater). Academics who studied at the college went on to teach at University College Cork (Graham Allen), Oxford Brookes University (William Gibson), Wuhan University (James R. Lewis), and St David's College itself (William Henry Harris, Dic Edwards and Daniel Silvan Evans). The list of alumni also includes one member of the Welsh Parliament (Rhodri Glyn Thomas), a founding member of the Social Democratic Party (Sue Slipman), a polar explorer (Hannah McKeand), and several writers and poets (Ian Marchant, E. A. Markham, Adrian Mourby, Peter Paphides and Fred Secombe). In 1965, the college began accepting female students for the first time. It was renamed St David's University College in 1971 after joining the federal University of Wales, and in 1996 renamed again to University of Wales, Lampeter. In 2010, the college merged with Trinity University College to form the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.

It was produced and directed by Wayne Coles-Janess. The film focuses on the guerrillas of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army in Papua New Guinea as they fight against the Bougainville Copper company and Papuan government forces. The guerrillas believe they are fighting to defend their independence and the local environment on the island of Bougainville. This film is notable for its subject matter as most Western media was not reporting the Bougainville Civil War. Synopsis The Island of Bougainville is located in the Solomon Islands archipelago but is a territory of Papua New Guinea. Beginning in the late 1980s, the people of this Island have fought a guerrilla war with salvaged and recovered World War II weaponry against government forces supplied with more modern equipment. The government has instituted a complete economic blockade of the island in addition to an extended campaign of aerial bombardment and violence against its civilian population. Bougainville - Our Island, Our Fight depicts the world of Bougainville residents as they leave their traditional coastal society to take refuge from a dangerous military conflict. An explanation of the conflict's causes reveals that the installation of an open cut copper mine at Panguna had initially offered promise of economic prosperity for the region. Bougainville residents eventually determined that the mine project entailed significant ecological damage and social exploitation. Through interviews, \\"Bougainvillians\\" discuss their initial recognition of the consequences of this mine, which led to the poisoning of their water supply and the degradation of farmlands and jungle habitat. Later scenes show the difficulties which Bougainville residents face due to the naval blockade of their island. The blockade prevents them from receiving medical and humanitarian aid, leading to declining health and the emergence of leprosy cases. Some supplies are smuggled from the Solomon Islands. Production The filmmaker Wayne Coles-Janess and his crew violated the Papua New Guinea government blockade. He had to be smuggled onto and off the island. The film includes the first and only television interview with the BRA President Francis Ona and the defecting Papua New Guinea officer, BRA General Sam Kouna.

Under his administration the Teutonic Order would reach their greatest extent. Konrad von Jungingen came from the Swabian League. He joined the Teutonic Order together with his younger brother Ulrich around 1380. At first he was a commander at the castle in Osterode. In 1391 he was promoted to the Treasurer of Marienburg. Konrad's election to Grand Master and head of the Order arose through an indirect fashion. As chairman of the order, policy excluded him from consideration. One of the brothers, Wolf von Zolnhart, proposed his candidacy for the post of grand master. His proposal went unopposed and on November 30th, 1393, they elected him unanimously as Grand Master. Konrad von Jungingen opted to retain most of the policies of his predecessors. However, unlike them, he chose the path of diplomacy. He interfered with the Lithuanian Civil War between the great princes - once supporting Vytautas, another time in favor of Skirgaila. He also intended to weaken Poland-Lithuania and the superior rights of Ladislaus II to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Thanks to his clever policy, he obtained Samogitia for the Order. In 1402, taking advantage of the financial problems of Sigismund von Luxembourg, he bought the Neumarch. However, territorial acquisitions brought him more problems than benefits. In the Neumarch, the local knights objected to the dictatorial power of the Order, while a peasant uprising instigated by Ladislaus II broke out in Samogitia. In 1398, King Albert of Sweden pledged the island of Gotland to the Order in an attempt to curtail the predatory attacks of the Victual Brothers on maritime shipping throughout the Baltic Sea. Later that year Konrad lead a successful invasion force and destroyed Visby. This would bring Konrad into conflict with the newly formed Kalmar Union under Queen Margaret I of Denmark when the Order refused to relinquish Gotland. The threat of war on all sides forced Konrad von Jungingen to seek agreement with one of his rivals. In this situation, Konrad von Jungingen decided to make diplomatic overtures to Krakow. In 1404 he met Ladislaus in the bishopric of Kuyavia in Raciaz. His cessation of Dobrzyn to the Polish Crown, guaranteed peace with Poland-Lithuania. He died after a long illness on 30 March 1407 in Marienburg. He was buried in the mausoleum of the great masters under the chapel of St. Anne. According to the Chronicle of Gda≈Ñsk, the dying Grand Master warned the Teutonic dignitaries against choosing his militant brother as a successor, calling him a fool.

She first appeared in Ant #1 (March 2004), published by Arcana Studios. Ant was created by Mario Gully and is currently published by Image Comics. Publication history The Ant comic was originally published by Arcana Studios in March 2004. The creator and artist, Mario Gully, has stated that the concept of Ant was created while he was incarcerated in 1996 for attempted armed robbery. Gully says that one day he was looking through a barred cell window and a tiny ant crawled in from the outside. He later vowed to change his life and make something out of himself. He then created Ant. Vol. 1 (Arcana Studios) \\"Days Like These\\", published by Arcana Studios. The first volume ran for 4 issues before moving to Image Comics. =Story= The original Arcana mini-series followed 8-year-old Hannah Washington, a lonely young girl continually tormented and bullied at school. Her father, apparently an accountant ‚Äî and later on, a blue-collar employee ‚Äî by profession, is made a suspect in an armed robbery and is taken into custody. To escape the harsh realities of her life, she writes in her diary stories of an alter-ego: an adult version of herself who is a superhero known as Ant. Hannah appears to know more about the world than she ought to and often has the personality of an emotionally unstable young adult, and her new principal takes interest in her as a result. She ends up unintentionally dropping her diary, and it is read and returned by her friend Stephen, who later on appears as \\"Gadget Man\\" in Ant's Cockroach battle, the events of which we are allowed to follow whenever Hannah's diary is read or written into. Hannah's father was released from custody but eventually, his home gets raided as the authorities apparently have the evidence they need to put him away. Hannah is found foaming at the mouth, having a seizure on the floor. The son of the man he allegedly killed pushes for the death penalty ‚Äî which would normally be too severe a punishment, but due to his influence, his demands are met and Hannah's father is sentenced to death. We then find Hannah's mother, Betty, working as a cabaret dancer of sorts, had left many years ago and she makes an unwelcome step back into Hannah's life, since Hannah's father requested her to. However, after reading her diary Betty comes to the conclusion that it was a mistake to leave. Meanwhile, Ant is beaten by the cockroach and loses her exoskeleton. Stephen rescues her and gives her a can which recharges her blood-sugar and her exoskeleton grows back. She then defeats the Cockroach. Hannah finally manages to obtain information using Ant to clear her father's name ‚Äî it turns out that the murdered man's son, and Betty's rich lover, was the actual culprit; but he is shot dead by the police when he is about to kill Betty, who has just discovered his guilt. Hannah's happiness at getting her parents together is short-lived, though. When told by the policewoman Inez that it is impossible for Ant to have helped Hannah as she had said Ant was who she would be in the future, she blacks out, and eventually ends up awakening in a straitjacket confined possibly in a sanitarium somewhat into her middle teens. The news of her revival brings forth a visit from her mother, who is in bereavement when informing Hannah of her father's apparent demise. This piece of info shocks Hannah. She manages to escape, leaving behind one of the cans she used to regenerate her exoskeleton in her story, which leads on to the second volume. Vol. 2 (Image Comics) \\"Reality Bites\\", published by Image Comics, featured heavy hitters such as Spawn and the Savage Dragon as co-stars. This series ran for 11 issues. Issue #8 became infamous for a scene where a stripper removes her underwear, exposing her buttcheeks. The creator later apologized for the scene. =Story= An adult Hannah Washington wakes up in a mental institution, where she has been told all her memories are the result of a coping mechanism described as a \\"juvenile power fantasy.\\" But, little by little, her fantasies of her life as Ant become more and more real. Vol. 3 (Big City Comics) Ant: Unleashed is the third volume of the series, released in 2008 by Big City Comics. This run focuses on a more mature version of Ant. Six issues were scheduled, but only the first three were published as of May 2008, later issues being cancelled without a resolution to the story. Vol. 2--continued (Image Comics) In 2012 ANT creator Mario Gully sold ANT to Savage Dragon creator Erik Larsen. Ant's second volume will be concluded with its 12th issue and a new series will be launched in 2013. Powers and abilities Ant possesses the typical enhanced speed and strength of many bug-based superheroes, but in addition she has bladed antennae which provide her with superhuman-level senses and weapon application. One of the more interesting aspects of the character is her exoskeleton, which appears to be regenerated by use of her blood-sugar. When her armor wears down, it breaks off rather quickly and she must recharge her blood-sugar in order to regenerate it. She seems to use some kind of spray-can with an ant symbol to do this.

Since 2008 these battles have been commemorated by Battle for Australia Day, which falls on the first Wednesday in September. Historiography and commemoration The Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) and the Battle for Australia Commemoration National Council campaigned for over a decade for official commemoration of a series of battles fought in 1942, including the Battle of the Coral Sea, Battle of Milne Bay and Kokoda Track campaign, as having formed a \\"battle for Australia\\". This campaign met with success, and in 2008 the Australian Government proclaimed that commemorations for the Battle for Australia would take place annually on the first Wednesday in September, with the day being designated \\"Battle for Australia Day\\". This day recognises \\"the service and sacrifice of all those who served in defence of Australia in 1942 and 1943\\". The day is not a public holiday. Peter Stanley, the former principal historian at the Australian War Memorial, argues that the concept of a 'Battle for Australia' is mistaken as these actions did not form a single campaign aimed against Australia. Stanley has also stated that no historian he knows believes that there was a 'Battle for Australia'. In a 2006 speech, Stanley argued that the concept of a Battle for Australia is invalid as the events that are considered to form the battle were only loosely related. Stanley argued, \\"The Battle for Australia movement arises directly out of a desire to find meaning in the terrible losses of 1942\\" and that \\"there was no 'Battle for Australia', as such\\", as the Japanese did not launch a co-ordinated campaign directed against Australia. Furthermore, Stanley stated that while the phrase \\"Battle for Australia\\" was used in wartime propaganda, it was not applied to the events of 1942 until the 1990s and that countries other than Australia do not recognise the \\"battle\\" of the Second World War.Peter Stanley (2006). \\"Was there a Battle for Australia?\\".

Juravich is also a musician and labor movement activist. Education and career Juravich, a former mechanic, received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1983 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. From 1984 to 1993 he was an assistant and associate professor in the Department of Labor Studies at Penn State University where he also directed a workers' education program for wage-earners in the Philadelphia area. In 1993, Juravich was appointed as an associate professor of labor studies at UMass Amherst, being full professor in 1997. He was director of the UMass Amherst Labor Center from 1997-2006 and 2016-2018. Research focus Tom Juravich studies work, workers and the labor movement. As an ethnographer, his exploration of the labor process began with his participant observation as a machine mechanic in a New England wire mill which was published in his first book, Chaos on the Shop Floor: A Worker‚Äôs View of Quality, Productivity and Management. Despite the degradation and segmentation of work, he found that workers retained more (unrecognized) skills than many had suggested. He continued his work on the labor process with At the Altar of the Bottom Line: The Degradation of Work in the 21st Century that explores the work of nurses, call center representatives, industrial workers, as well as undocumented workers in the fish processing industry. Juravich returned to exploring the complex ways that workers‚Äô skills persist in his ‚ÄúArtifacts of Workers Knowledge: Finding Skill in the Closing and Restructuring of a Furniture Manufacturer\\" in Ethnography. He is currently researching wage theft and the work of undocumented workers in residential construction and is part of an NSF grant exploring the impact of artificial intelligence and computer-based technology on the future of work. Juravich‚Äôs research on the labor movement focuses on organizing and strategic campaigns. His quantitative research with Kate Bronfenbrenner on organizing documented the importance of grassroots rank-and-file tactics for successful organizing in both the private and public sector. Beginning with his Ravenswood: The Steelworkers‚Äô Victory and the Revival of American Labor on the Steelworkers‚Äô (with Kate Bronfenbrenner) he had also written extensively about union strategic campaigns. His chapter ‚ÄúBeating Global Capital: A Framework and Method for Union Strategic Corporate Research and Campaigns,‚Äù pioneered an approach to strategic corporate research and campaigns and is widely cited and utilized in the labor movement. Building on this approach Juravich created and is the webmaster for www.StrategicCorporateReseach.org a comprehensive website for conducting corporate research in the U.S. and Canada. He teaches strategic corporate research and campaigns to a variety of union, community and environmental groups. Juravich continues to write about the contemporary labor movement in recent articles, including ‚ÄúConstituting Challenges in Differing Arenas of Power: Workers‚Äô Centers, the Fight for $15 and Union Organizing.‚Äù He also builds on his work in labor history and union culture that he began with Commonwealth of Toil: Chapters in the History of Massachusetts Workers and Their Unions (with Jim Green and William Hartford) with his recent ‚ÄúBread and Roses: The Evolution of a Song, Labor Songbooks, and Union Culture.‚Äù He is also co-editor with his colleagues at the UMass Labor Center of Labor in the Time of Trump. Musical works Juravich has produced five recordings of labor and roots music. His first album, Rising Again, was produced by the United Auto Workers. His 1989 A World to Win and the 1991 Songs from the Film Out of Darkness: The Mine Workers Story (produced by Academy Award Winner Barbara Kopple) were released on Flying Fish Records.

During more than 40 years in film and television he was most frequently cast as a supporting actor playing brutish bad guys but occasionally played more sympathetic roles just as effectively.Magers, Boyd, Characters and Heavies, westernclippings.com, retrieved December 1, 2012 Early life and career Gordon was born in Brooklyn in New York City on December 2, 1922. Reared by his father in dire poverty, Gordon grew up during the Great Depression. He left school in the eighth grade, went to work in construction and demolition, and then joined the New Deal agency, the Civilian Conservation Corps, in which he participated in various public works projects. After the United States entered World War II in 1941, Gordon enlisted in the U.S. Army, in which he served for two years and received an undesirable discharge. Gordon was in southern California where he and a cohort attempted to rob a bar and its patrons with a pistol. He was shot in the stomach by one of the officers making the arrest.p.178 Lewis, C. Jack White Horse, Black Hat: A Quarter Century on Hollywood's Poverty Row Rowman & Littlefield, 2002 Convicted of armed robbery, he served five years in San Quentin Prison, where he furthered his education by reading nearly every book in the library. Gordon took advantage of the benefits accorded him as part of the G.I. Bill and began taking acting lessons at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (ADA). During his time at the ADA, Gordon was enrolled with several future screen legends including Grace Kelly and Anne Bancroft. For a time, Jason Robards, later a two-time Academy Award winner, was Gordon's instructor. It was there where he also met his future wife, Lynn Cartwright, who would have a sporadic but lengthy career as a character actor, mainly in television. They were married in 1950 and remained together until his death a half century later. They had one child, a daughter named Tara. Actor in film and television Gordon started his career on the stage and worked with such luminaries as Edward G. Robinson and Tyrone Power. He was soon discovered by a Hollywood agent in a Los Angeles production of Darkness at Noon. Over the course of his career Gordon would appear in more than 170 film and television productions from the early 1950s to the mid-1990s. In 1954 Gordon portrayed the outlaw Bill Doolin, a native Arkansan who founded the Wild Bunch gang and operated primarily in Kansas, on the syndicated television series Stories of the Century, starring and narrated by Jim Davis. In 1955 he was cast on the ABC religion anthology series Crossroads in the role of Sergeant Leroy in \\"All My Love\\". In 1958 he appeared as Joe Brock in the episode \\"Desert Fury\\" of CBS's Tales of the Texas Rangers, a children's program. That same year Gordon was cast as Zip Wyatt in \\"Three Wanted Men\\" of Rex Allen's syndicated Western series Frontier Doctor. He also played a gunslinging professional killer in the pilot for the television version of Gunsmoke; but many changes were later instituted on the series, such as the marshal's office and Long Branch Saloon looking markedly different and the relationship between Matt Dillon and Kitty being subtly more formal as well, so the episode was buried deep in the season in the hope that viewers would not notice, which apparently worked. Gordon was often cast to make the most of his height, intense features, deep menacing voice, and icy stare. He had radiant light blue eyes. One of his earliest films was Riot in Cell Block 11, shot at Folsom prison.Leo Gordon, retrieved December 1, 2012 The film's director, Don Siegel, who worked with such screen tough guys as Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, related that \\"Leo Gordon was the scariest man I have ever met.\\" Other notable roles included that of John Dillinger in Siegel's Baby Face Nelson, opposite Mickey Rooney as the crazed protagonist. Gordon may be most noted for his recurring character Big Mike McComb on the ABC/Warner Bross Western television series Maverick, working from 1957 to 1960 alongside James Garner and Jack Kelly. Gordon's five appearances in the role include the much remembered episode \\"Shady Deal at Sunny Acres\\", \\"According to Hoyle\\", as well as \\"War of the Silver Kings\\", the first installment broadcast. Garner later recalled in his videotaped interview for the Archive of American Television that Gordon purposely punched him for real in one of their first scenes together and that Garner hit him back when filming the next scene. Garner and Gordon reunited in the 1970s when Gordon appeared as a dimwitted bodyguard on four episodes of NBC's The Rockford Files. Gordon appeared in multiple roles on Robert Stack's 1959 ABC crime drama The Untouchables. Gordon also guest-starred on the ABC/WB western series The Alaskans opposite Roger Moore. He was cast as Damian in the 1961 episode \\"Million Dollar Suit\\" of the ABC/WB crime drama The Roaring 20s. He also appeared on the NBC Western series Empire and Laredo. One of Gordon's best-remembered television appearances on CBS's The Andy Griffith Show in the episode \\"High Noon in Mayberry\\", in which he portrays an ex-convict who appears destined for revenge against Sheriff Andy Taylor of fictitious Mayberry. The screenwriters for the episode, Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum, borrowed heavily from Gordon's brief criminal career and subsequent incarceration in order to supplement the role.Beck, Ken and Clark, Jim, The Andy Griffith Show Book, New York: St. Martin's Press (1985), , p. 156. In 1964, Gordon won a Grammy in The Defenders for \\"Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role\\". There he played the condemned convict Joey Tassili in an episode titled \\"The Madman\\". Perhaps Gordon's single most memorable film scene occurred in McLintock! (1963), during which John Wayne knocks him down a long mudslide after uttering the famous line \\"Somebody oughta belt you but I won't! I won't! The hell I won't.\\" Another notable role was in the 1966 western The Night of the Grizzly opposite Clint Walker, one of the very few actors who could match Gordon's intense screen presence regarding physical size and strength. Gordon played bounty hunter Cass Dowdy, who had a soft spot for his enemy's son but would, as one character said, \\"...hunt anything for a price, man or animal.\\" Somehow, Gordon managed to make his character as sympathetic as he was frightening, and in his final scene he gives his life to save the boy. Gordon portrayed sympathetic parts when called upon to do so, including his performances in the Western Black Patch (1957), a film that he wrote, and in Roger Corman's civil rights drama The Intruder (1962), opposite a young William Shatner. In 1965, he was cast as the troublemaker Bender in the syndicated western series Death Valley Days in the episode \\"No Gun Behind His Badge\\", a dramatization of the Abilene, Kansas, marshal Thomas J. Smith, depicted in the segment by Ronald W. Reagan. The episode also starred Michael Witney as Wild Bill Hickok, who succeeded Smith as marshal. In 1970 Gordon appeared as Loma Bartender on The Men From Shiloh (rebranded name for The Virginian) on the episode titled \\"Hannah.\\" Gordon also appeared as ageing wrestler Milo Stavroupolis on NBC's Little House on the Prairie, starring Michael Landon. Gordon's final role was as Wyatt Earp in a 1994 episode of the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. He also appeared in the film Maverick that same year with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Screenwriter and novelist Gordon was also a prolific screenwriter and novelist. Usually credited as \\"Leo V. Gordon\\", he wrote dozens of scripts for television series and movies, sometimes writing a good role for himself. His first successful film script, The Cry Baby Killer, featured a young and unknown Jack Nicholson. Among the more notable feature films he wrote was You Can't Win 'Em All (1970) starring Tony Curtis and Charles Bronson. He also wrote the screenplay and appeared in Tobruk (1967), which starred Rock Hudson and George Peppard and was directed by Arthur Hiller. As a television screenwriter he wrote nearly 50 scripts apiece for Bonanza, Cheyenne and Maverick, in the episodes in which he was not a guest star. In the 1970s he appeared frequently as well on the popular police drama Adam-12, another show that he often scripted. Gordon once told an interviewer that because of his imposing size he never felt he was fully accepted as a screenwriter: \\"Writing is more rewarding than acting, but look at my face. Nobody believes I‚Äôm a writer. I should be 5' 8\\", 142 pounds, wear patches on my elbows and horn-rimmed glasses and smoke a pipe. That's a writer!\\" In addition to his script work for films and television Gordon wrote or co-wrote several novels, including the historical Western Powderkeg.Boren, Ray (1992). \\"Story Behind the Historical Novel 'Powderkeg' is a Saga in Itself,\\" Deseret News. Retrieved April 8, 2017. Later life and persona In contrast to his screen persona Gordon was a quiet, thoughtful and intelligent man who generally avoided the Hollywood spotlight. He was widely regarded by his fellow actors and his directors as a well-prepared professional. In 1997 he received the Golden Boot Award for his many years of work in westerns. In accepting the award the actor simply flashed a smile for his fans and remarked, \\"Thank God for typecasting!\\" After struggling with a brief illness, Gordon died of cardiac failure in his sleep, aged 78, at his home in Los Angeles, California, on December 26, 2000. His ashes and those of his wife, who died in 2004, are interred together in a memorial display in a columbarium at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.

He is visible several times in videos of the event, identifiable by his blue and white striped jacket. During the failed rescue attempt by Bavarian border guards and Munich police which resulted in the deaths of nine hostages and five of the Black September members, Al-Gashey was shot in the wrist attempting to aid a fellow Black September member. Early life In interviews, Al-Gashey has said that he was brought up in conditions of great poverty, mostly in the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon. His family was displaced in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, but always harbored a desire to return. Al-Gashey claimed that the injustice of being forced to live in squalor and rely on handouts while the \\"intruders\\" were living on his land fostered his hatred for Israel. This led to his joining the PLO in 1967. He said that during his initial training he felt, for the first time, \\"truly Palestinian ... not just a wretched refugee, but a revolutionary fighting for a cause.\\"Personal interview, in One Day in September. 1999. Role in the Munich massacre In July 1972, Al-Gashey was one of several young Black September members recruited for what he referred to as \\"special training,\\" without having any idea what their target might be. He flew to Munich at the end of August 1972, staying in a hotel and even attending a couple of Olympic events. On the night of 4 September, Al-Gashey met for dinner with the other members of the strike team, along with a senior Black September operative (believed to be Abu Daoud), who briefed them on their upcoming mission and drove with them in taxis to the Olympic Village. Al- Gashey claims that until that dinner meeting, he had no clue that the team's target was to be the Israeli Olympians. Although charged with multiple crimes related to the massacre, Al-Gashey and his surviving compatriots never stood trial. Nearly eight weeks after the massacre, on 29 October, a Lufthansa jet was hijacked by two Black September members, who demanded the release of the three Munich survivors. The jailed fedayeen were subsequently released by the West German government. When they landed in Libya, they were interviewed, with footage of this press conference being shown in the film One Day in September. Jamal Al-Gashey can be seen seated in the middle of the three, between his cousin Adnan (believed to be the guerilla who shot and killed five of the hostages who were tied up in one of the helicoptersWhen the Terror Began (2002). Time. Retrieved 7 June 2008.) and Mohammed Safady. When asked directly if he had killed any of the Israelis, Adnan Al-Gashey simply replied, \\"It's not important for me to say if I killed Israelim (sic) or not.\\"Press conference, as shown in One Day in September. 1999. Post-massacre life It is believed that Al-Gashey has spent the subsequent time since his release in hiding in North Africa. He is married and has two daughters. He is the only member of the group to consent to interviews, having given a brief statement in 1992 to a Palestinian journalist. In 1999, Al-Gashey emerged from hiding to give a more in-depth interview in the film One Day in September. Since Al- Gashey believed that Israeli agents were still trying to kill him, he was disguised and his face shown only in blurry shadow as a precaution. Director Kevin Macdonald noted Al-Gashey's edgy, almost paranoid behavior throughout the interview, but was able to convince him that the film he was working on would only be truly authentic if Al-Gashey gave his side of the story. During the 1999 interview, he explained, > I'm proud of what I did at Munich because it helped the Palestinian cause > enormously ... before Munich, the world had no idea about our struggle, but > on that day, the name of 'Palestine' was repeated all around the world.

She wishes the couple a happy life and leaves, never to return.

The arch travels backward, so that it ultimately runs to the left of the trachea. Structure At the cellular level, the aorta and the aortic arch are composed of three layers: The tunica intima, which surrounds the lumen and is composed of simple squamal epithelial cells; the tunica media, composed of smooth cell muscles and elastic fibers; and, the tunica adventitia, composed of loose collagen fibers. Innervated by barometric nerve terminals, the aortic arch is responsible for sensing changes in the dilation of the vascular walls, inducing changes in heart rate to compensate for changes in blood pressure. The aorta begins at the level of the upper border of the second sternocostal articulation of the right side, and runs at first upward, backward, and to the left in front of the trachea; then travels backward on the left side of the trachea and finally passes downward on the left side of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra. At this point the aortic arch continues as the descending aorta. The aortic arch has three branches. The first, and largest, branch of the arch of the aorta is the brachiocephalic trunk, which is to the right and slightly anterior to the other two branches and originates behind the manubrium of the sternum. Next, the left common carotid artery originates from the aortic arch to the left of the brachiocephalic trunk, then ascends along the left side of the trachea and through the superior mediastinum. Finally, the left subclavian artery comes off of the aortic arch to the left of the left common carotid artery and ascends, with the left common carotid, through the superior mediastinum and along the left side of the trachea. An anatomical variation is that the left vertebral artery can arise from the aortic arch instead of the left subclavian artery. The arch of the aorta forms two curvatures: one with its convexity upward, the other with its convexity forward and to the left. Its upper border is usually about 2.5 cm. below the superior border to the manubrium sterni. Blood flows from the upper curvature to the upper regions of the body, located above the heart - namely the arms, neck, and head. Coming out of the heart, the thoracic aorta has a maximum diameter of 40 mm at the root. By the time it becomes the ascending aorta, the diameter should be < 35‚Äì38 mm, and 30 mm at the arch. The diameter of the descending aorta should not exceed 25 mm. The arch of the Aorta lies within the mediastinum. Development The aortic arch is the connection between the ascending and descending aorta, and its central part is formed by the left 4th aortic arch during early development. The ductus arteriosus connects to the lower part of the arch in foetal life. This allows blood from the right ventricle to mostly bypass the pulmonary vessels as they develop. The final section of the aortic arch is known as the isthmus of aorta. This is so called because it is a narrowing (isthmus) of the aorta as a result of decreased blood flow when in foetal life. As the left ventricle of the heart increases in size throughout life, the narrowing eventually dilates to become a normal size. If this does not occur, this can result in coarctation of the aorta. The ductus arteriosus connects to the final section of the arch in foetal life and the ligamentum arteriosum when the ductus arteriosus regresses. Variation There are three common variations in how arteries branch from the aortic arch. In about 75% of individuals, the branching is \\"normal\\", as described above. In some individuals the left common carotid artery originates from the brachiocephalic artery rather than the aortic arch. In others, the brachiocephalic artery and left common carotid artery share an origin. This variant is found in approximately a 20% of the population. In a third variant, the brachiocephalic artery splits into three arteries: the left common carotid artery, the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery; this variant is found in an estimated 7% of individuals. Clinical significance The aortic knob is the prominent shadow of the aortic arch on a frontal chest radiograph.wrongdiagnosis.com > Aortic knob Citing: Stedman's Medical Spellchecker, 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Aortopexy is a surgical procedure in which the aortic arch is fixed to the sternum in order to keep the trachea open.

From its tower in Liberty, Missouri, KCXL broadcasts all hours of the day. Despite the \\"daytimer\\" correlation with Class D stations, KCXL's six nighttime watts continue the station's operation within Clay County. KCXL recently upgraded its daytime power to 4,000 watts. KCXL 1140AM also serves as a translator on K275BQ 102.9 MHz FM, in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. History Kansas Citians first heard a signal on 1140 kHz in 1967, when Liberty business owners, led by furniture store owner George Bedinger, established a country music station under the call letters KBIL. The format continued until 1978, when new owners opted for adult contemporary music. Although the switch proved unsuccessful in a matter of months, the station (as KFIX) included as its deejays Mike Murphy, who later became a legendary voice at KCMO, Randy Miller, who made his name as a shock jock on KBEQ-FM, and Rush Limbaugh, who briefly took his ‚ÄúJeff Christie‚Äù moniker here before finding his niche in talk radio. Some unsuccessful formats would find a reprieve on their sister FM signal at 106.5 MHz. The station, under various owners, tried different formats. In 1980, KDLY debuted, playing Oldies music. In 1984, KCXL letters debuted alongside an urban contemporary format. Studios were built within Kansas City's urban core. However, because the signal at night was limited to the suburban Northland, it eventually fell short competing with longtime station KPRS. The station ceased operations in 1992 and went silent for two years. Meanwhile, 106.5 was eventually sold to Entercom and is now the country station WDAF-FM. Current format Local resident Pete Schartel acquired the 1140 tower in 1994 and introduced an oldies station that eventually gave way to a talk station. With the slogan ‚ÄúRadio Free Liberty‚Äù, KCXL's programming is a mix of local talents, wacky cut-ups like the wack pack and national syndicate features that take an activistic approach, as well as usual local radio fare such as tradio. The syndicated programming airing on KCXL is a mixture of brokered programming (such as Joel Wallach's \\"Dead Doctors Don't Lie\\") and programming from the Genesis Communications Network and the Accent Radio Network. KCXL operates a bookstore at 203C Southwest Eagles Lane Parkway Grain Valley, Missouri. The Bookstore features products from shows carried by the station as well, like water filters, health supplements, books, videos and the always effervescent store manager Jonni. As KCXL principally broadcasts to Liberty, sports coverage includes the Blue Jays of Liberty High School and the Bearcats of Northwest Missouri State University. Sister station KCTO was signed to a local marketing agreement in March 2011 by the Ramirez Group and is no longer programmed by Alpine Broadcasting. The current KCXL format is mainly talk radio during the daytime. \\"Sports Radio 810\\" WHB now programs KCXL through a LMA from 6pm to midnight daily with overflow programming from ESPN Radio. Sundays continue to be manned by The JPEG Show Network and brings Contemporary Christian music and sports. Hosted by James and Peggy Peuster, they enter their 9th year of radio ministry. On April Fools' Day 2012, the station played Christmas music from noon - 2 p.m. CDT. On Sunday, October 30, 2016 at 6pm, KCXL launched a new overnight Dance format as Surge Radio. Surge runs from midnight to 6am nightly, and starts at 6pm on Sunday nights. This format is operated under a time brokerage agreement with North Carolina-based Surge Media, LLC which also operated WEGG under the same brand. Surge Media has stated that it will expand the Dance programming with every 1,000 additional likes to the Facebook page.

History = Founding 1542‚Äì1664  Following the Reformation of the 1530s, the Letters Patent setting up the school were issued on 24 July 1542. By these, tithes assigned to local churches at Llanfihangel Crucorney, Llanddewi Rhydderch, Llanelen, Llanddewi Skirrid, Bryngwyn and Llanwenarth and belonging previously to the Benedictine priory were now given over to the new school. In addition a much richer prize, the tithes of Badgeworth in Gloucestershire which had previously belonged to Usk priory were given over to Abergavenny's use. Finally the priory chapel of St. Mary's was to become the new parish church of Abergavenny and so the redundant church of St. John's could be used to house the new school.Nelmes (1992), p. 3 The monies available from these tithes were to be put into trust controlled by \\"the bailliffs and commonality\\", the forerunners of the Town Council. It was to provide a Free Grammar School where Latin grammar was taught. The new grammar school was named after its benefactor Henry VIII who also appointed its first headmaster, Richard Oldsworthy. The school when it opened had 26 pupils, all boys aged between 7 and 14.  The connection with Jesus College, Oxford 1664‚Äì1887  The first century of the school's life was uneventful and change only came as a result of financial mismanagement by the local trustees who had leased out the Badgeworth lands for an undervalued rent: when the 99-year lease came to an end in 1664 it passed to Jesus College, Oxford, who in return provided not only an equal rent but a Fellowship and Scholarship to the college. This began the close connection between the school and the college which not only provided a home for many of its ablest pupils, but also provided the school with its headmasters. An Act of Parliament in 1760 reorganised the school's governance. Henceforth Jesus College, which had finally gained control of the Gloucester tithes, was responsible for paying the headmaster and his assistant. The Act did have some effect as the old school building was pulled down and replaced on site with the religious tower and fine Georgian master's house which still stands today. By the time of the headmastership of the Reverend William Morgan (1765‚Äì75) the school was flourishing with some 70-80 boys.Nelmes (1992), p. 4 Change began in the 1870s. The Headmaster, James Webber, reorganised the curriculum, teaching classics, maths, drawing, French, writing, divinity and arithmetic. He built two new classrooms within the confines of St. John's. By 1878, 73 pupils were being taught by three masters. By 1887 the charity commissioners had prepared a scheme to create a second grade commercial school, on a new site, and it was this proposition that resulted in the severing of the centuries-old links between the school and Jesus College.  A century of reorganisation 1891‚Äì1972  The first attempt at reorganisation was the 1891 scheme which proposed the creation of a 200 pupil school on a 9-acre site on Pen-y-pound. Building of the school was delayed by many problems and was not completed until 1898 at a cost of ¬£6,945. The school at this time was supposed to be a grammar school taking pupils from all over North Monmouthshire with a curriculum of Latin, English, History, Geography, French, Arithmetic, Algebra, Trigonometry and Chemistry.Nelmes (1992), p. 5 In the 1920s there was new building with three classrooms, a gym and a library. The Old Boys' Association was founded at a meeting on 7 November 1923 and was soon thriving, with branches of the Abergavenny Society in both London and Aberystwyth. By 1930 the school had 150 pupils. The new sciences of Physics and Biology were introduced in the period and the increased importance of metalwork and woodwork led to the building of a handicrafts room. Following Butler's Education Act of 1944, Monmouthshire County Council put forward three options for Abergavenny: boys and girls grammar schools and a secondary modern school; a co-educational grammar school and a secondary modern school or a multilateral school. All three options were to be tried over the next 25 years. Harry Newcombe retired as headmaster in 1954. He had managed to gain the school a good reputation as a classical grammar school. The Local Education Authority issued a Statutory Notice on 21 September 1954 to set up a multilateral school of 850, the first stage of which would be the amalgamation of the Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools. Between 1954 and 1956 plans were laid by the authority for an enlarged mixed grammar school and finally provided for a school of 510 pupils with a 60 pupil sixth form.Nelmes (1992), p. 6 The new school on the Old Hereford Road site was to be the first phase of the multilateral school, the present Upper school. It was to have an assembly hall, a gym and three floors of classrooms and practical rooms. Building was only begun in 1960 and so the school was not opened until 1963. It was to be made up of a total of 448 pupils from King Henry VIII Boys Grammar School, the Girls' Intermediate High School, St. John's Private school and the Convent school. The transition from mixed grammar to comprehensive school was carried out under the headmaster, Russell Edwards. This involved the building of a new school adjoining the grammar school on the Pen-y-pound site. It also involved the incorporation of Grofield Secondary Modern School which had been established in 1947. Until the new building was completed in 1972 this required the juggling of both staff and pupils between the different sites. The new comprehensive kept the name of its predecessor. The old grammar school became the Upper School while the new building became the Lower School.Nelmes (1992), p. 7  Recent History 1972‚Äì  The school with a planned population of 850 pupils when conceived in the 1940s had a peak population of 1825 pupils in 1983. In 1983 as part of the International Year of Communications the school participated in a satellite quiz with Parramatta High School in New South Wales, Australia, which was celebrating its 70th anniversary. The school saw a sharp decline in numbers over the course of the 1980s, with 1200 pupils in 1990. Pupil numbers have remained broadly consistent over the following two decades.  School houses  The school originally had two houses Oppidan and Rustican, from the Latin for Town and Country. As the school grew, a new house structure was created based on four of Henry VIII's wives: Aragon (Catherine of Aragon), Howard (Catherine Howard), Parr (Catherine Parr) and Seymour (Jane Seymour). These houses continue to compete at the annual Eisteddfodau and at sporting occasions.

Welsh government school banding  When the Welsh government started grouping schools into five bands in 2011, the school was placed in Band 3, assessed on its performance in the academic year 2010-11. In the 2012 assessment this had fallen to Band 5. The year's figures brought the Government's banding system under severe criticism from teaching unions and opposition political parties. The results were described as being based on \\"arbitrary and misleading\\" figures and \\"not credible\\", \\"crude\\" and \\"vague and confusing\\". The school remained in Band 5 in 2013. Early in 2015, the Welsh Government replaced the former number-based banding system with a more colourful approach. The school was rated 'amber', meaning \\"in need of improvement. Following an assessment of 'adequate' by Estyn in 2015, Elspeth Lewis, headteacher, was quoted in the South Wales Argos saying, \\"The report accurately reflects the current position of the school. But there has been a relentless focus on standards, teaching and learning and leadership over the past 18 months. As a school we have an accurate picture of where we are and are committed to further improving in each key area.\\"  Motto  The school is associated with two separate mottos. For many centuries the school's motto had been 'that we shall be of service' (Latin: Ut Prosim), but it was decided that, for the sake of change, a new motto should be created. A brave new motto was found which encouraged reverence for then History teacher, Mr. Nelmes, and commanded the hugging of the off-green space towers which newly adorned the school's buildings. That motto is \\"Respecting tradition, embracing the future\\".

The regiment, known before independence as The Poona Horse (17th Queen Victoria's Own Cavalry), was raised as a regular cavalry regiment in the Bombay Presidency army of the East India Company. It was formed from the 3rd Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry, raised in 1820, and the Poona Auxiliary Horse, raised about 1817‚Äì18. The latter unit was absorbed into the regular forces about 1860 and the two regiments later became the 33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry and the 34th Prince Albert Victor's Own Poona Horse. These were amalgamated in 1921 into the present regiment, the battle honours of which tell of service in three Afghan wars, in Persia, Abyssinia and China, as well as in the Great War. The regiment has fought with distinction in the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pakistani wars, with an officer winning India's highest gallantry award, the Param Vir Chakra, in each war. History In accordance with article VI of The Treaty of Poona between the British Governor-General of India Lord Hastings and Baji Rao II (The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire), a cavalry regiment was raised on 15 June 1817. As per the treaty, the force would be maintained by the Maratha Peshwa and was supposed to be permanently stationed in the territory of Peshwas. The treaty provided authority for the British to use the force against the Peshwa when necessary. The regiment was raised under the order of Mountstuart Elphinstone, the Governor of Bombay. The two regiments that would go on to form the Poona Horse were the 33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry and the 34th Prince Albert Victor's Own Poona Horse. 33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry Raised at Sirur on 4 May 1820 by Major Peter Delamotte. * 1820 3rd Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry * 1861 3rd Regiment of Bombay Silladar Light Cavalry * 1861 3rd Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry * 1876 3rd (The Queen's Own) Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry * 1903 33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry * 1911 33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry * 1921 33rd/34th Cavalry * 1922 17th Queen Victoria's Own Poona Horse * 1927 The Poona Horse (17th Queen Victoria's Own Cavalry) * 1947 To Indian Army * 1950 The Poona Horse (17 Horse) 34th Prince Albert Victor's Own Poona Horse Raised at Poona (now Pune) on 15 July 1817 as a result of the treaty between the HEIC and the Peshwa Bajee Rao II. * 1817 The Auxiliary Horse * 1818 The Poona Auxiliary Horse * 1847 The Poona Irregular Horse * 1861 4th Regiment of Poona Silladar Horse * 1861 1st Regiment of Poona Horse * 1862 The Poona Horse * 1885 4th Bombay Cavalry (Poona Horse) * 1890 4th (Prince Albert Victor's Own) Bombay Cavalry (Poona Horse) * 1903 34th Prince Albert Victor's Own Poona Horse * 1921 33rd/34th Cavalry * 1922 17th Queen Victoria's Own Poona Horse * 1927 The Poona Horse (17th Queen Victoria's Own Cavalry) * 1947 To Indian Army * 1950 The Poona Horse (17 Horse) World War I In August 1914, the Poona Horse was stationed at Secunderabad, as part of the 9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade. They were brigaded with the 7th Dragoon Guards and the 20th Deccan Horse. The Brigade was dispatched to France and fought on the Western Front their first action being the First Battle of Ypres. France On 2 November 1914 the regiment was sent to reinforce the 2nd Gurkhas in the Neuve Chapelle sector on arrival they discovered that the Gurkhas defences had been breached and overrun. The Poona Horse was asked to recapture the position. The Regiment launched a counterattack in daylight and without any artillery support. The Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Swanston, who was leading the attack, was killed. , In France the regiment would be involved in the Battle of Givenchy, Battle of La Basse, Battle of Armentiers, Battle of the Somme (1916), Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette and Battle of Cambrai (1917). In February 1918, the Poona Horse and all the other Indian cavalry regiments in France were deployed to Palestine to join General Allenby's forces. Palestine The Poona Horse arrived in Egypt in April 1918; they now formed the 14th Cavalry Brigade of the 5th Cavalry Division with the Deccan Horse and the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry. The force also consisted of the 4th Cavalry Division, the Australian Mounted Division and the ANZAC Mounted Division. On 19 September 1918, the allied offensive began. The Infantry broke through the Turkish defences and the Desert Mounted Corps followed up. When they reached the Gates of Damascus, the Poona Horse, along with rest of the 14th Cavalry Brigade, were tasked with patrolling the road from Homs to Damascus Road. When they charged a party of Arabs who ran off leaving a large car behind with a European seated inside the Risaldar Major Hamir Singh, believing him to be a spy, demanded his surrender. The European turned out to be Colonel T. E. Lawrence. \\"El Aurens\\" was not amused. At 10:15 on the morning of 1 October 1918, the Regiment entered Damascus and after the rest of the Brigade. The Regiment was ordered to take Rayak and then march onto Aleppo, which they reached on 25 October just before the Armistice was signed on 30 October in Mudros Harbour, abroad the battleship . Mesopotamia The 33rd Queen Victoria's Own were sent to Mesopotamia as part of the 6th (Poona) Division to counter Turkish advances and to protect the oil fields. They were involved in the Battle of Shaiba and the Battle of Ctesiphon. Between the wars In 1919, the 33rd Light Cavalry, now part of the 1st (Risalpur) Cavalry Brigade, was posted to Risalpur where they were brigaded with the 1st Lancers and M Battery, RHA. On 6 May 1919, they received the information that the Afghan Army had attacked the outpost at Landi Khanna, north of the Khyber Pass, and was advancing into India. The infantry attacked the Khyber Pass to push the Afghans back. Once the pass had been cleared the cavalry advanced and after some skirmishing, and two set piece battles, the Afghan Army was dispersed. Amalgamation In 1920, the decision was made to reduce the number of Indian Cavalry Regiments from 39 to 21. This would leave the army with 18 amalgamated regiments, plus the 27th Light Cavalry, the 28th Light Cavalry and the Guides Cavalry. This change was promulgated under Indian Army Order No 1257 22 November 1921. Based on this decision, the 33rd Light Cavalry and 34th Poona Horse were amalgamated as the 33rd/34th Cavalry, which was changed in 1922 to the 17th Queen Victoria's Own Poona Horse. The regiment's new organisation was now three sabre squadrons and a headquarters squadron, which would contain all the specialists, i.e., machine gunners, signalers etc., in one squadron. World War II The Poona Horse was one of two Indian Army cavalry regiments selected to remain horsed while the rest of the cavalry was mechanised. This situation did not last long and just after the start of the war the regiment was mechanised. The Headquarters Squadron now had a mortar troop, signals troop, 'B' echelon administrative troop and light Aid Detachment for forward vehicle recovery and repair. The sabre Squadrons each now comprised a Squadron Headquarters, four armoured carrier troops and one rifle troop. Each troop had four Bren carriers and the rifle troop was mounted in four 15 cwt Chevrolet trucks now mechanised they become the Divisional reconnaissance regiment for the 6th Indian Division and deployed to Iraq. In 1942 the regiment was ordered to the middle east to join the British Eighth Army. In the closing stages of the First Battle of El Alamein, the Poona Horse was the guard force for General Claude Auchinleck, the commander of the 8th Army at the tactical headquarters sited on the Ruweisat Ridge, the most prominent tactical feature of the Alamein position. This was the highlight of the Regiment's war for they were then ordered back to Iraq as part of the British Tenth Army. In September 1944 the Regiment was sent to Cyprus on garrison duties and were still there in May 1945 when Germany surrendered. The Regiment returned to India in October 1945 and were issued their first tanks, the Stuart MK IV. Post Independence Post Independence the Regiment was part of the 1st Armoured Division (India) and participated in Operation Polo, Operation Ablaze and Operation Nepal. The division consisted of the 9th Armoured Brigade and 43rd Lorried Infantry Brigade. The Armoured Brigade consisted of the 16th Cavalry, Hodson's Horse and the Poona Horse equipped with upgunned Sherman tanks and Centurion tanks. The regiment brought home decisive victories in the Battle of Phillora in 1965 and Battle of Basantar in 1971 Indo-Pak war, by sheer gallantry of legendary Lt Col A B Tarapore and 2nd Lt Arun Khetrapal, who were posthumously awarded the prestigious Param Vir Chakra.

Located in the borough of Ville-Marie, the district is situated on the southernmost slope of Mount Royal. The downtown region houses many corporate headquarters as well a large majority of the city's skyscrapers ‚Äî which, by law, cannot be greater in height than Mount Royal in order to preserve the aesthetic predominance and intimidation factor of the mountain. The two tallest of these are the 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re and 1250 Ren√©-L√©vesque, both of which were built in 1992. The Tour de la Bourse is also a significant high-rise and is home to the Montreal Exchange that trades in derivatives. The Montreal Exchange was originally a stock exchange and was the first in Canada. In 1999, all stock trades were transferred to Toronto in exchange for an exclusivity in the derivative trading market. Place Ville- Marie, an I. M. Pei-designed cruciform office tower built in 1962, sits atop an underground shopping mall that forms the nexus of Montreal's underground city, the world's largest, with indoor access to over 1,600 shops, restaurants, offices, businesses, museums and universities, as well as metro stations, train stations, bus terminals, and tunnels extending all over downtown. The central axis for downtown is Saint Catherine Street, Canada's busiest commercial avenue. The area includes high end retail such as the Holt Renfrew Ogilvy department store as well as Les Cours Mont-Royal shopping centre. Other major streets include Sherbrooke Street, Peel, de la Montagne, de Maisonneuve and Crescent. The skyline may be observed from one of two lookouts on Mount Royal. The lookout at the Belvedere takes in downtown, the river, and the Monteregian Hills. On clear days the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York are visible (the great-circle distance between Mount Royal and the U.S. border along a bee line normal to the border being only ~ 56 km, or ~ 35 miles), as are the Green Mountains of Vermont.

The name comes from Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi bureaucrat who helped to orchestrate the Holocaust, but claimed that he did so without feeling anything about his actions, merely following the orders given to him. The use of \\"Eichmann\\" as an archetype stems from Hannah Arendt's notion of the \\"banality of evil\\". According to Arendt in her 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem, Eichmann relied on propaganda rather than thinking for himself, and carried out Nazi goals mostly to advance his career, appearing at his trial to have an ordinary and common personality while displaying neither guilt nor hatred. She suggested that this most strikingly discredits the idea that the Nazi war criminals were manifestly psychopathic and fundamentally different from ordinary people. The idea that Eichmann ‚Äî or, indeed, the majority of Nazis or of those working in such regimes ‚Äî actually fit this concept has been criticized by those who contend that Eichmann and the majority of Nazis were in fact deeply ideological and extremely anti-Semitic, with Eichmann in particular having been fixated on and obsessed with the Jews from a young age.for example, see German political scientist Clemens Heni goes so far as to say the phrase \\"belittles the Holocaust\\". The phrase has been attributed to anarcho-primitivist writer John Zerzan, from his essay Whose Unabomber? written in 1995, although it had already been coined by the 1960s, as various prior examples are known..

Note the increased edge contrast with the hinted text but more faithful character shape and more natural inter-character spacing in the unhinted text. Font hinting (also known as instructing) is the use of mathematical instructions to adjust the display of an outline font so that it lines up with a rasterized grid. At low screen resolutions, hinting is critical for producing clear, legible text. It can be accompanied by antialiasing and (on liquid crystal displays) subpixel rendering for further clarity.  Overview  For the purpose of on-screen text display, font hinting designates which primary pixels are interpolated to more clearly render a font. Hints are usually created in a font editor during the typeface design process and embedded in the font. A font can be hinted either automatically (through processed algorithms based on the character outlines) or set manually. Most font editors are able to do automatic hinting, and this approach is suitable for many fonts. However, high-quality commercial fonts are often manually hinted to provide the sharpest appearance on computer displays. Verdana is one example of a font that contains a large amount of hinting data, much of which was accomplished manually by type engineer Tom Rickner.  Implementations  In the TrueType font format, released in 1991 by Apple Inc, hinting invokes tables of font data used to render fonts properly on screen. One aspect of TrueType hinting is grid-fitting, which modifies the height and width of font characters to line up to the set pixel grid of screen display. The open-source FreeType 2 font rendering engine uses an auto-hinter when such hinting data are not present or their use is restricted by a software patent. As of 2011, the FreeType Web site states that the relevant font hinting patents have now all expired, and hinting is now enabled in FreeType by default.  Guidelines  According to the TrueType Reference Manual,https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM03/Chap3.html#features TrueType Reference Manual font instructors (those performing font hinting) must balance the following two constraints when hinting a font: * At small sizes, chance effects should not be allowed to magnify small differences in the original outline design of a glyph. * At large sizes, the subtlety of the original design should emerge. The Manual suggests that, for screen viewing, fonts should be readable at 9 points per em at 72 Pixel per inch. Particular attention should be paid to the cap height, x-height, and baseline, so that the font retains its normal character while not producing exaggerated effects at small sizes.

Though traditionally wood-fired, coal- fired ovens were common in the 19th century, and modern masonry ovens are often fired with natural gas or even electricity. Modern masonry ovens are closely associated with artisanal bread and pizza, but in the past they were used for any cooking task involving baking. Masonry ovens are built by masons.  Origins and history  Humans built masonry ovens long before they started writing. The process began as soon as our ancestors started using fire to cook their food, probably by spit-roasting over live flame or coals. Big starchy roots and other slower-cooking foods, however, cooked better when they were buried in hot ashes, and sometimes covered with hot stones, and/or more hot ash. Large quantities might be cooked in an earth oven: a hole in the ground, pre-heated with a large fire, and further warmed by the addition of hot rocks. Many such practices continue today, as well as showing up in the archeological record, but masonry ovens like the ones we know now only appear with the start of grain agriculture ‚Äî in other words, bread (and beer ‚Äî which is the likely source of the yeast used to make the first bread rise). Ancient Egyptians left drawings of bakers putting dough on a hot rock and covering it with a hot clay pot ‚Äî the first ‚Äútrue‚Äù oven. Over time, the single-loaf ovens grew large enough to bake multiple loaves, and construction practices expanded from holes in the ground to clay pots to brick and rock domes and vaults. Masonry ovens are used in the Persian Gulf region for the preparation of the traditional khubz bread. In India, tandoors are traditional clay ovens, although these days modern electrically fired tandoors are available. The open-topped tandoor is a transitional design between the earth oven and the Roman-plan masonry oven. In the precolumbian Americas, similar ovens were often made of clay or adobe and are now referred to by the Spanish term horno (meaning \\"oven\\"). Hornos are also traditional in the American Southwest. The traditional direct- fired masonry design is often called a \\"Roman\\" or \\"black\\" oven and dates in Western culture to at least the Roman Republic. It is known as a black oven because the fire generates soot on the roof of the oven. Black ovens were often built to serve entire communities (compare the banal ovens of France, which were often owned by the local government and whose operators charged a fee to oven users). Such ovens became popular in the Americas during the colonial era. They are widely used in artisanal bakeries and pizzerias, restaurants featuring pizzas and baked dishes, and increasingly as small backyard or home ovens. So-called \\"white ovens\\" are a later development, and are heated from the outside of the masonry such that flame and soot never touch the inner oven walls‚Äîthey are more common as accessory features of a masonry heater. A compromise design known as the gueulard in France combines aspects of both internal and external-fired models.  Efficiency and use  A modern gas-fired masonry oven used in a restaurant A masonry wood-fired oven, during the firing (heating) stage Masonry ovens remain popular in part because of the way their use affects cooking processes and food flavor. Where modern gas or electric ovens cook food by moving hot air around inside an insulated, lightweight box, a masonry oven works by soaking up heat, like a battery building up a full charge. When hot, the heavy oven walls release the heat slowly, for hours. Thus the food is cooked not only by hot air but also by radiant heat from hot dense masonry and especially for bread and pizza, which are not cooked in pans, heat conducted directly into the food from hot floor bricks (bakers call the resulting added rising action of bread \\"oven spring\\".) Finally, a masonry oven seals in the steam produced by the water in cooking food. A supercharged steamy atmosphere produces a more flavorful and chewy crust (see Maillard reaction); it also keeps other foods moist and tender. The triple combination of radiant, conductive, and convected heat also speeds cooking. Wood-burning masonry ovens are mandated for production of true Neapolitan pizza.  Construction  In the same way that masonry oven cooking techniques have not changed much over the millennia, neither have construction practices. Whether built with mud, brick, or modern refractories, any oven is basically a masonry shell, a smaller version of structures such as the Roman Pantheon, Brunelleschi'l's dome in Florence, or Houston's Astrodome. Early ovens were simply clay soil (usually tempered with sand to reduce cracking, as in brick-making) built up over a form of sticks or sand. When the clay was stiff enough to cut open a doorway, the sand was dug out, or the wood was burned out. Smoke is vented out the oven door, either directly to the outside or through a chimney immediately above the oven door. Brick ovens can also be built over formwork, though many cultures developed dome-building methods that required no forms, such as traditional Italian dome ovens. These are laid up free-form, sometimes only by eye. The first course is a circle of brick or half-bricks; the next course is laid on a wedge-shaped mortar bed. Each succeeding circle of brick sits at a steeper pitch and draws the dome closer to the center. Suction between dry bricks and wet mortar holds bricks in place until the courses approach vertical, at which point the mason may use a stick as additional support until the top of the dome is closed with the central keystone. Square or rectangular ovens can be built with standard bricks and little cutting. Specially tapered arch bricks make for easier and stronger vaults, but without buttressing or a steel harness, the weight of the vault pushes out on the walls and can cause collapse. Round ovens require more cutting, but generally need less buttressing. Whether the materials are mud and brick, the latest high temperature castables, or pre-fabricated modular ovens, all these methods are still in use. In all cases, the ovens typically go under a roof or some kind of weather protection.  Modern insulation practices  Perhaps the most significant change in masonry oven construction practices is insulation. Since masonry loses heat as fast as (or faster than) it absorbs it, early ovens extended bake times by increasing mass. Thicker walls held more heat to bake more bread ‚Äî but only up to a point. Since heat moves from high to lower temperature, the outside of the oven cannot get as hot as the inside ‚Äî unless it is wrapped in a fireproof blanket. Like a person in a bed, an oven needs a mattress underneath, as well as a blanket over top, but where a person may weigh a couple of hundred pounds, an oven may weigh thousands. Nature offers few materials that combine compressive strength, insulative properties, and imperviousness to high temperatures, but recent technology has greatly expanded the options.  Thermodynamics of insulating masonry ovens  Heat is defined as energy, and as such, it moves from higher levels of energy (i.e., temperature) to low. At the atomic level, heat is the motion of the atoms and electrons that make up a material. The more the particles move, the higher the heat. Excited particles bouncing off each other transfer the heat, moving it from hot to cold. Imagine, for example, a gang of little boys with big pockets full of superballs. Bouncing balls resemble excited (hot) molecules. As the boys empty their pockets, the bouncing balls bump into each other and spread out. They bounce farther away, the boys chase after them, the excitement spreads farther. Eventually, all the balls disappear in the bushes, boys tire out, and bouncing stops. Cold. Here on earth, the sun delivers much bounce, and the atmosphere surrounds it with a wall that reflects the energy back in. In outer space, however, there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äî a vacuum ‚Äî and the bounce all disappears very quickly, leaving very little moving. Lack of motion means little heat, and almost no transfer ‚Äî very cold. Closer to home, if you wrap your hot coffee in a thermos ‚Äî a hollow cylinder with all the air sucked out of it ‚Äî there‚Äôs also very little in the way of excitable particles to move the energy from your hot coffee to the cold air around it. Your coffee stays hot. While you can‚Äôt wrap a ton of oven brick in a vacuum bottle, you can slow heat loss by raising it up off (or out of) the damp ground. Traditional Canadian clay ovens were even built on wood frames, which is possible when the masonry is thick enough to prevent the wood from getting too hot (over-firing can be dangerous). Other insulative plinth material might include lightweight stone like tufa or pumice. In the 1980s, Alan Scott, called by some the grandfather of modern wood-fired ovens, popularized a practice of building ovens on a lightweight slab of concrete made with lightweight aggregate such as pumice, perlite, or vermiculite. He further reduced heat loss by extending the rebar through the formwork onto the tops of the side walls, effectively ‚Äúhanging‚Äù the slab (and oven) on the supporting walls. Removing the form left about an inch of air gap to isolate the entire oven structure from the base. That isolation effectively broke the thermal ‚Äúbridge‚Äù that otherwise allowed heat from the oven to leak into the base. Other methods achieve similar results. Commercially available, high- strength insulative board makes a good, firm, warm ‚Äúoven mattress‚Äù that conveniently solves the problem of weight bearing insulation and provides an easy way to break contact with surrounding cold. Some earthen oven builders use a lo-cost combination of empty glass bottles surrounded by an insulative mix of clay and fine organic matter (sawdust, chaff, nut shells, etc.); as the organics burn out, they leave thousands of tiny voids in the clay, making a spongey, insulative, and firm foam-like material. To keep the top of the oven warm, masons may build walls around the oven, crib-like, to make space for a loose cover of perlite, pumice, or vermiculite. For a smaller profile and a rounder look, the oven may be wrapped in mineral wool blankets (similar to fiberglass but made from clay or rock and much more resistant to high temperatures and thermal cycling). Mineral wool blankets do need to be covered ‚Äî either with a reinforced stucco shell, tile, or equivalent. Based on a survey of Canadian clay ovens, Boily and Blanchette suggest an ideal relationship between door and dome height of 63% -- a higher dome will reduce radiant heat, while a high door will allow heat to escape; if the door is less than 63% of dome height, air and smoke can't circulate freely and the fire won't burn well. Modern masonry ovens sometimes bear little resemblance to their forebears, and can have just a cast deck (similar to a pizza stone) inside a more conventional oven exterior. Such devices are primarily used in commercial settings, though tabletop models are available.Cookery equipment manufacturer Cuisinart sells a tabletop \\"brick oven\\" that uses a pizza stone- like lining to store heat for baking.https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-pizza- photos-pg-photogallery.html Making a Masonry Oven in your own home Los Angeles Timeshttps://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-homepizza25-2009mar25-story.html A pizza parlor in your kitchen Los Angeles Times  Types  Cob, clay, and earthen ovens = Cob is the British name for what is essentially adobe (from Arabic, \\"al toba,\\" meaning \\"the mud;\\" \\"cob\\" is the Anglo-Saxon word for \\"lump,\\" and is also used to describe round loaves of bread, or small, compact horses).

Wood-fired ovens make popular starter projects, which has generated a large number of \\"cob oven\\" projects, many of them documented on the web. However, early masonry ovens going all the way back to ancient Egypt were typically made of native clay, often tempered (to minimize cracking) with gravel, sand, and/or straw. Smaller ovens were built over forms made of sand, or a rough, basket- like shell made of sticks. After the form was covered, the sand was shoveled out, or the sticks burnt. Clome ovens were a modular (and sometimes portable) variant‚Äîessentially a large, upside-down clay pot with an door opening cut into the side. They were often surrounded with brick as they were built into English chimneys, allowing coals and ashes to be swept onto the common hearth, and smoke to go into the chimney. \\"Like the Athenian cooking bell and the primitive quern, the rough clay oven had its counterparts for several thousand years, among its descendants being our own seventeenth-century Devon gravel- tempered clay wall ovens.... Built into the side wall of the open hearth so that from the front only the opening was visible, these primitive-looking ovens were still being produced in Barnstaple potteries as late as 1890\\". = Ceramic cloche = A cloche or cooking bell is like an upside-down, fired ceramic bowl with a handle on top. It is heated in the fire along with a flat rock or open spot on the hearth. The prepared dough is placed on the hot rock or hearth floor, and then covered with the cloche, and perhaps hot coals or ashes for additional heat. The method goes back to ancient Egypt and Greece, and was probably the first form of masonry oven.  Simulation  It is possible to get some of the benefits of a masonry oven without constructing a full oven. The most common method is the stoneware pizza stone, which stores heat while the oven is preheating and transmits it directly to the bottom of the pizza. Common firebricks can be used in a similar manner to cover a shelf. Bread and meat can be cooked in a type of covered ceramic casserole dish known variously as a cloche, a Schlemmertopf (brand name), or the like. Good results can also be had by cooking the bread in a pre-heated Dutch oven with a well- fitting lid. Most expensive is a ceramic or stoneware oven liner that provides many of the benefits of a cloche without restricting the baker to one size of pan. It is sometimes possible to cook bread on a grill to simulate the use of radiant heat in a masonry oven; while this is generally reserved for flatbreads and pizzas, a few recipes for loaf breads are designed to use a grill as well, with or without a masonry or ceramic heating surface.

Reconstruction began in 1973 by Reza Memaran Benam under the supervision of Iranian Ministry of Culture. However, it is still incomplete. interior view of main hall, Blue Mosque, Tabriz, Iran History Plan of the Blue Mosque reconstruction. The Blue mosque of Tabriz was built upon the order of Jahan Shah, the ruler of the Kara Koyunlu. Jahan Shah's wife, Khatun Jan Begum (died 1469), estestablished the endowment (vaqf) for the mosque's construction. However, just a few years later, Jahan Shah and his Kara Koyunlu were toppled by Uzun Hassan of the Ak Koyunlu, and Tabriz was taken. Jahan Shah's daughter, Saleha Khatun, was allowed to oversee the rest of the construction work by the new rulers. During the reign of Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan, \\"the cupola of the mosque's mausoleum as well as its main parts were completed\\". Sandra Aube adds: \\"A few details from the mausoleum‚Äôs interior, such as alabaster pieces from the wall panels and the main prayer niche (me·∏•rƒÅb), reveal that the mausoleum was never completely finished (Golombek and Wilber, p. 407; Aube, p. 248)\\". Though the mausoleum was never completed, when the Safavids assumed control over Tabriz and made it their capital, the Blue Mosque itself served the new rulers as a mosque during the first half of the 16th century. In 1514, after the Safavids were defeated at the decisive Battle of Chaldiran, the Ottomans occupied and looted Tabriz, including the Blue Mosque. Aube notes that at least eight carpets were looted by the Turks and taken to Istanbul. Aube notes that even though it is not known whether the Turks attacked the structure itself during the capture and occupation of the Blue Mosque, several earthquakes did damage the building between the 16th and 18th centuries. It was especially severely damaged by the earthquake of 1780. However, in the 17th century, the Blue Mosque was already reportedly \\"completely destroyed and abandoned\\". In the 19th century, the local people of Tabriz looted the building's ruins. In the 20th century, during the Pahlavi era, the mosque was finally rebuilt. Reconstruction is performed by plans and supervision of Mohammad Reza Memaran Benam, a traditional architect from Tabriz, with authority of the Iranian Organization of Cultural Heritages.

The title literally means ‚Äúa priceless book about medicines of an Eastern Country‚Äù. The word \\"Eastern\\" is not the antonym to the Western World's 'Western', but Heo Jun gave the book such a name because Eastern Country was one of the sobriquets of Korea. The book is regarded as important in traditional Korean medicine, and is one of the classics of Oriental medicine today. As of July 2009, it is on UNESCO‚Äôs Memory of the World Programme.What is the Dongui Bogam?

Its categorization and ordering of symptoms and remedies under the different human organs affected, rather than the disease itself, was a revolutionary development at that time. It contains insights that in some cases did not enter the medical knowledge of Europe until the twentieth century.Fifty Wonders of Korea_2_Science and Tech_KSCPP.pdfFile:Icons-mini-file acrobat.gif Work on the Dongui Bogam started in the 29th year of King Seonjo‚Äôs reign (1596) by the main physicians of Naeuiwon (ÎÇ¥ÏùòÏõê, ‚Äúroyal clinic‚Äù), with the objective to create a thorough compilation of traditional medicine. Main physician Heo Jun led the project but work was interrupted due to the second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597. King Seonjo did not see the project come to fruition, but Heo Jun steadfastedly stuck to the project and finally completed the work in 1610, the 2nd year of King Gwanghaegun‚Äôs reign.An ancient medical text gains worldwide recognition , Korean Press The book The Dongui Bogam consists of 25 volumes. In contrast to Hyangyak jipseongbang (Ìñ•ÏïΩÏßëÏÑ±Î∞©, \\"Compilation of Native Korean Prescriptions\\"), written in 1433, Dongui Bogam is more systematic. It not only refers to Korean medicinal texts, but also Chinese medicinal texts, and records illnesses practically with their respective remedies. Dongui Bogam at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture Contents The book is divided into 5 chapters: Naegyeongpyeon (ÎÇ¥Í≤ΩÌé∏, ÂÜÖÊôØÁØá, Internal Medicine), Oehyeongpyeon (Ïô∏ÌòïÌé∏, Â§ñÂΩ¢ÁØá, External Medicine), Japbyeongpyeon (Ïû°Î≥ëÌé∏, Èõ£ÁóÖÁ∑®, Miscellaneous Diseases), Tangaekpyeon (ÌÉïÏï°Ìé∏, ÊπØÊ∂≤Á∑®, Remedies), and Chimgupyeon (Ïπ®Íµ¨Ìé∏, ÈçºÁÅ∏Á∑®, Acupuncture)., UNESCO *Naegyeongpyeon primarily deals with physiologic functions and equivalent disorders of internal organs. The interactions of five organs - liver, lungs, kidneys, heart, and spleen - are thoroughly explained. *Oehyeongpyeon explains the function of visible parts of the human body - skin, muscles, blood vessels, tendons, and bones - and the various related illnesses. *Japbyeongpyeon deals with diagnosis and healing methods of various illnesses and disorders such as anxiety, over-excitement, stroke, cold, nausea, edema, jaundice, carbunculosis, and others. This chapter also has a section for pediatrics and gynecology. *Tangaekpyeon details methods for creating remedies and potions such as the collection of medicinal herbs and plants, creating and handling of medication, correct prescription and administration of medicine. All herbal medicine is categorized with explanations regarding their strength, gathering period and their common names for easy understanding. *Chimgupyeon explains the acupuncture procedures for various ailments and disorders. Dongui Bogam offered not only medical facts, but also philosophical values of Eastern Asia. Heo Jun conveyed the message that maintaining the body's energies in balance leads to one's good health. The first page of the book is an anatomical map of the human body, linking human body with heaven and earth which embodies the Asian perspective of nature. Dongui Bogam at Britannica Korea Editions There have been several print editions of Dongui Bogam besides the original Naeuiwon edition, within Korea and abroad. The first Chinese edition was printed in 1763 with additional prints in 1796, and 1890. The Japanese edition was first printed in 1724, and then 1799. UNESCO Memory of the World Register and controversy In 2009, UNESCO decided to add Dongui Bogam to the cultural heritage list due to its contribution as a historical relic and it was placed on UNESCO‚Äôs Memory of the World Programme, becoming Korea's seventh cultural heritage to be thus included.Dongui Bogam, Korea Times, 2009-07-31. However, doctors clashed over Dongui Bogam after the official listing. The Korean Medical Association (KMA) downplayed the book‚Äôs importance saying that ‚Äúit shouldn‚Äôt be taken as anything more than a recognition of the book‚Äôs value as a historical relic. It should not be taken as an acknowledgement of traditional medicine for its superior effectiveness‚Äù Listing the fact that the book is full of quackery such as how to bear a son or how to make yourself invisible. The KMA emphasized that Dongui Bogam was merely a cultural artifact and not science.

He is attributed as the founder of the Itt≈ç-ry≈´ (\\"one sword\\" or \\"one stroke\\") school of sword fighting. Originally named It≈ç Yagor≈ç, at the age of fourteen, he found himself in a small seaside village called Izu. According to legend, he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from ≈åshima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor≈ç chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor≈ç's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor≈ç reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang≈´ Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor≈ç but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor≈ç would later describe it as Mus≈çken (Â§¢ÊÉ≥Ââ£), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Mus≈çken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin. In another predicament, Itt≈çsai developed Hosshato when engaging multiple enemies in his bedroom. He would later change his name to \\"It≈ç Itt≈çsai Kagehisa\\" (Itt≈çsai being a 'Bug≈ç', martial name). It is said Itt≈çsai's style evolved from the Ch≈´j≈ç-ry≈´ style of his master, Kanemaki Jisai. Among the many pupils that Itt≈çsai trained, one such was his successor, Ono Tadaaki, who would go on to serve the Tokugawa. The It≈ç-ry≈´ style is grounded for some in Zen influence due to Ono Tadaaki's contact with the famed Buddhist priest, Takuan S≈çh≈ç. This is a reasonable assumption since later It≈ç-ry≈´ swordsmen advocated directness and simplicity in their technique of the \\"one stroke.\\" In order to become famous, it is said It≈ç Itt≈çsai fought 33 duels in a Musha Shugy≈ç without losing even once which makes him second to Miyamoto Musashi's over 60 duels. His main sword was a katana crafted by the Ichimonji school, heirs of the great Emperor Go-Toba's investment in swordmaking. This sword was the one Itt≈çsai used in his 33 duels, and was later passed on to Grand Masters of the Itt≈ç-ry≈´, starting with the 4th one, Kamei Heiemon. In one of Itt≈çsai's duels, he defeated Migogami Tenzen despite Itt≈çsai being armed with a wooden bokken and Tenzen using a traditional steel katana. Itt≈çsai wielded his weapon so precisely that he didn't harm Tenzen at all. Tenzen went on to be Itt≈çsai's disciple, and would become the second head of Itt≈çsai's ryu after changing his name to Ono Tadaaki. ReferencesFurther reading * De Lange, William (2006).

After completing his schooling in Pune, Tarapore joined the Hyderabad Army, and was commissioned in January 1942. Initially he joined the infantry, but was later transferred to an armoured regiment, the 1st Hyderabad Imperial Service Lancers. During World War II Tarapore saw action in the Middle East. After Hyderabad State was annexed by India in 1948, Tarapore was selected to join the Indian Army. He was commissioned again in April 1951, and was posted to the Poona Horse regiment, 17th Battalion. Later he attended a training course in the United Kingdom on the Centurion tank. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, 17 Horse saw action in the Sialkot sector. Tarapore led the regiment in several tank battles between 11and16 September, and was killed in one such battle at Butur- Dograndi on 16September. Under his leadership the regiment destroyed sixty Pakistani tanks, while the Indians suffered the loss of nine. Early life Ardeshir Burzorji Tarapore was born on 18August 1923 in Bombay. Ratanjiba, one of Tarapore's ancestors, was a military leader under Chatrapati Shivaji. The family name \\"Tarapore\\" was the namesake of the village of Tarapur, Maharashtra. It was the leading village of those in the charge of Ratanjiba. Later, Tarapore's grandfather relocated to Hyderabad and started working in the Customs and Excise Department of the Nizam of Hyderabad. His father, B. P. Tarapore, was a scholar of Persian and Urdu languages; he worked for the same Customs and Excise Department. Tarapore joined Sardar Dastur Boys' Boarding School, Pune, at the age of seven. He did not do well at academic subjects, but was a good sportsman. He completed his schooling in 1940, and was the school captain that year. Shortly after he applied for a commission in the Hyderabad Army, and was selected. He completed his initial training at the Officers' Training School (OTS) Golconda and OTS Bangalore. He was commissioned into the 7th Hyderabad Infantry as a second lieutenant on 1January 1942. Military career Popularly known as \\"Adi\\", Ardeshir Tarapore was unhappy joining the infantry, as he wanted to join an armoured regiment. When his battalion was being inspected by Major General Syed Ahmed El Edroos, then Commander-in-Chief of the Hyderabad state forces, a live grenade accidentally fell into a bay area during a live-ammunition training exercise. Tarapore quickly picked it up and threw it away. The grenade exploded mid-air inflicting shrapnel wounds to his chest. Major General Edroos witnessed his actions and was impressed. He summoned Tarapore to his office and congratulated him. Tarapore took the opportunity to request a transfer to an armoured regiment. The general agreed and transferred him to the 1st Hyderabad Imperial Service Lancers. During World War II, Tarapore and his unit saw action in the Middle East. As a result of Operation Polo in 1948, Hyderabad merged with the Union of India, and its forces were eventually amalgamated into the Indian Army. Tarapore was selected for the Indian Army and was commissioned as a captain on 1April 1951. He was first posted on probation for two years to 'B' Squadron of the Poona Horse regiment, 17th Battalion, and later transferred to 'A' Squadron as its second-in-command. India acquired Centurion tanks in the early 1960s and Tarapore was one of the officers selected to attend a training course in the United Kingdom. He was promoted to major on 1 January 1958, and to lieutenant-colonel on 10 June 1965. Battle of Chawinda Beginning in April 1965, India and Pakistan engaged in a series of skirmishes across the Line of Control (LOC). In August, Pakistan attempted mass infiltration into Kashmir in Operation Gibraltar. On 5 August, Pakistani soldiers crossed the LOC dressed as Kashmiri locals, heading for various areas within Kashmir. After locals reported the presence of Pakistani troops, the Indian Army captured several disguised Pakistani soldiers and foiled the infiltration operation. On 1 September, Pakistan launched a counterattack, named Operation Grand Slam, to capture vital points that would cut off supply routes to Indian troops. This plan eventually was foiled by the Indian troops. Later on 6 September, Indian forces crossed the Radcliffe Line, marking the official beginning of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Indian I Corps was given the responsibility of capturing the Sialkot sector. Poona Horse was part of the 1st Armoured Division, attached to I Corps. It was tasked to isolate Sialkot from Lahore. On 11September 1965 Poona Horse launched an attack on Phillora. To surprise the Pakistanis, it was decided to attack Phillora from the rear. As part of the regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tarapore, was attacking Phillora from Chawinda, it encountered Pakistani armour advancing from Wazirwali. Tarapore held his ground and attacked Phillora under enemy tank and artillery fire. When wounded he refused to be evacuated. His regiment successfully captured Wazirwali on 14September. On the 16th they advanced to capture Jassoran, supported by 9 Dogra, and Butur-Dograndi, supported by 8 Garhwal. In the latter battle his tank was hit several times. Tarapore was mortally wounded, and succumbed to his injuries. Under his leadership the regiment had destroyed sixty Pakistani tanks, while the Indians had suffered the loss of nine. According to one account, Pakistani tanks held their fire during his cremation. Param Vir Chakra National War Memorial, New Delhi Tarapore was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, for leading the regiment while injured, and inflicting significant tank losses on the Pakistani side, with an effective date of award of 11September 1965. The official citation reads: His wife received the award on Tarapore's behalf from the President of India. Later, as her own health deteriorated, it was handed over to the regiment and preserved in its quarter guard.

It was directed by Jamil Dehlavi, and written by Akbar S. Ahmed and Jamil Dehlavi. It stars Christopher Lee in the lead role as Jinnah. Plot The film opens with the words of Professor Stanley Wolpert: The guide takes Jinnah to 1947 where, at the Cromwell conference with Lord Mountbatten, Jinnah demanded a homeland for Indian Muslims. After World War II, the British Imperial Government intends to withdraw and grant independence to the subcontinent. This would mean a Hindu- dominated state. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims were increasing after the Second World War. Flashbacks resume when the Guide recounts the marital life of Jinnah, when he fell in love and married a Parsi named Rattanbai Petit, later known against the will of her parents, mainly on grounds of religion and the difference in their ages. In 1922, Jinnah faces political isolation as he devoted every spare moment to be the voice of moderation in a nation torn by Hindu-Muslim antipathy. That created tension between Rattanbai and Jinnah. She finally leaves him with their daughter in September 1922, and they eventually separate in 1927. Rattanbai died of cancer on 18 February 1929. The death of Rattanbai had a huge impact on Jinnah's life and his fight for Pakistan. He went back to British India in order to start a political journey of the two-nation theory. In 1940, the Muslim League annual conference is held from 22 to 24 March. Jinnah addresses thousands of Muslims and gives them the assurance of the birth of Pakistan. The Guide questions Jinnah as to who he loves the most apart from Ruttie and Fatima. He then mentioned his daughter, who married a Parsi boy without his permission. While he was addressing a Muslim League conference in 1947, Muslims fanatics attacked the conference and argued that if Pakistan is to be a Muslim state it cannot give equal rights to women and non-Muslims. Jinnah replies that Islam doesn't need fanatics but people with vision who can build the country. However, the partition of India was carried out, and the Guide and Jinnah saw the massacre of Muslims in migration done by Hindus and Sikhs. Jinnah is sworn in as the first Governor-General of Pakistan and announces Liaqat Ali Khan as the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. After independence and the end of British rule, Pakistan stands as a new nation and sanctuary for the Muslims of the subcontinent. Jinnah is given the title of Quaid-e-Azam of Pakistan. Jinnah waits for the first train carrying Muslims who left India for Pakistan, but when the train arrives, they are all found dead save for one infant child. Fatimah and Lady Edwina Mountbatten visit refugees and Lady Mountbatten learns the importance of independence. Mountbatten betrays Jinnah as the Hindu Maharaja of Kashmir, Sir Hari Singh, stalls his decision on which nation to join. With the population in revolt in October 1947, aided by Pakistani irregulars, the Maharaja accedes to India; Indian troops are airlifted in. Jinnah objects to that and orders that Pakistani troops move into Kashmir, which leads to a war between India and Pakistan then and afterward from time to time in the Kashmir conflict. The film jumps into a final fictional scene of Lord Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (last Viceroy of India) in a Heavenly Court. Jinnah is fighting a case against him over his betrayal. The film ends with Jinnah and his angel judge traveling back in time to the scene of Muslim refugees. Jinnah expresses his sorrow over the plight of the refugees and result during the division of Punjab. They chant \\" Pakistan Zindabad\\" in response, which ends the film.

The feudal lord (French: seigneur) often had, among other banal rights, the duty to provide and the privilege to own all large ovens within his fief, each operated by an ovenmaster or fournier. In exchange, personal ovens were generally outlawed and commoners were thus compelled to use the seigniorial oven to bake their bread. Such use was subject to payment, in kind or money, originally intended merely to cover the costs associated to the construction, maintenance and operation of the oven. Seigniorial ovens were masonry ovens built on the Roman plan and were large enough to hold an entire community's ration of bread. For example, in the hamlet of Nan-sous-Thil (C√¥te-d'Or, France), the villagers were required to bake their bread at the four banal, as at home they were permitted only a small oven placed under the hood of the chimneypiece, for baking \\"g√¢teau et flan\\". Those regulations sought to reduce the risk of fire where thatched cottages huddled together. The danger was real, as demonstrated in 1848 when a full quarter of the neighbouring hamlet of Thil-la-Ville was consumed by a fire that ignited from sparks when a housewife heated her oven.Lucien Logeat, Nan-sous-Thil Semur-en-Auxois, 1940, noted in a review by Albert Colombet, \\"Review: En feuilletant une monographie de village\\", Annales d‚Äôhistoire sociale 3.1/2 (January - June 1941):78-80. The oven design, but not necessarily the feudal monopoly on oven operation, was carried to French colonies. In New France, it was the only banal right commonly established and the oven's fortified construction also served to protect the colonists during skirmishes. The four banal system seems to have died out in France during the 18th century, though it was a time when some dormant seigneurial rights were being insisted upon by an aristocracy hard-pressed for cash, as an official m√©moire suggests: Traditions surrounding the four banal may have lasted as late as World War II. In some rural areas of France, the old communal ovens are still extant (illustration) and are sometimes used for community celebrations.

Yahoo! Inc. et Soci√©t√© Yahoo! France (LICRA c. Yahoo!) is a French court case decided by the Tribunal de grande instance of Paris in 2000. The case concerned the sale of memorabilia from the Nazi period by Internet auction and the application of national laws to the Internet. Some observers have claimed that the judgement creates a universal competence for French courts to decide Internet cases. A related case before the United States courts concerning the enforcement of the French judgement reached the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, where a majority of the judges ruled to dismiss Yahoo!'s appeal. Criminal proceedings were also brought in the French courts against Yahoo!, Inc. and its then president Timothy Koogle; the defendants were acquitted on all charges, a verdict that was upheld on appeal.  The civil case in France  LICRA complained that Yahoo! were allowing their online auction service to be used for the sale of memorabilia from the Nazi period, contrary to Article R645-1 of the French Criminal Code (Code p√©nal ). These facts were not contested during the case. The defense rested on the fact that these auctions were conducted under the jurisdiction of the United States. It was claimed that there were no technical means to prevent French residents from participating in these auctions, at least without placing the company in financial difficulty and compromising the existence of the Internet. The defendants noted #that their servers were located on US territory, #that their services were primarily aimed at US residents, #that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression, and that any attempt to enforce a judgment in the United States would fail for unconstitutionality. As such, they contended that the French court was incompetent to hear the case.  Article R645-1  Article R645-1 of the French Criminal Code prohibits to \\"wear or exhibit\\" in public uniforms, insignias and emblems which \\"recall those used\\" by *an organisation declared illegal in application of Art. 9 of the Nuremberg Charter, or by *a person found guilty of crimes against humanity as defined by Arts. L211-1 to L212-3 or by the Law ‚Ññ 64-1326 of 1964-12-26. Display is allowed for the purposes of films, theatrical productions and historical exhibitions. The penalty is a fifth class fine (up to 1,500 EUR), to which can be added one or more complementary penalties among: * withdrawal of the right to possess or hold any regulated weapon for up to three years; * confiscation of one or more regulated weapon either possessed by the convict or to which he has a free access; * confiscation of the objects concerned; * from 20 to 120 hours of community service.  The judgment  An interim judgment of May 22, 2000 confirmed the illegal nature of the sale under French law and appointed experts to advise the court as to what technical measures might be taken to prevent a repeat of the offense. The team of experts reported on November 6, and the court rendered an injunction against the defendants on November 10. Tribunal de grande instance (T.G.I.) (ordinary court of original jurisdiction) Paris, May 22, 2000 and November 22, 2000, No RG:00/0538 had given the judgment. = Competence of the French court = The court ruled that there were sufficient links with France to give it full jurisdiction to hear the complaint. In particular: *the auctions of Nazi memorabilia were open to bidders from any country, including France; *the display of such objects, and the viewing of such objects in France, caused a public nuisance and was forbidden under French criminal law; *Yahoo! Inc. was aware that French residents used its auction site, as it displayed French-language advertisements on its pages when they were accessed from computers in France. This last point was also referred to in the injunction against Yahoo! Inc. The court specifically dismissed the claim that the alleged problems of enforcing a judgment were sufficient to nullify its competence. = Soci√©t√© Yahoo! France = Soci√©t√© Yahoo! France had been ordered on May 22, 2000 to warn its users that they may breach French law if they followed links from its site to sites operated by Yahoo! Inc. The court acknowledged that this order had been substantially complied with \\"in letter and in spirit\\". It refused a request from the plaintiffs to order Yahoo! France to remove links to the American sites, but reiterated that a warning must be given to users before they activated such links. = Yahoo! Inc. = Yahoo! Inc. had been ordered on May 22, 2000 to take all appropriate measures to deter and prevent access to auctions of Nazi memorabilia on its site by French residents. Yahoo! contended that it was impossible to comply with this order. The report of the court- appointed experts noted that, as of 2000, roughly 70% of French Internet users could be identified as such by the use of DNS databases. The court ruled that Yahoo! Inc. must comply with the original injunction within three months or face a fine of one hundred thousand (100,000) francs (15,244.90 EUR) per day.  Proceedings in the United States  On January 10, 2001 Yahoo! announced that it would not appeal against the ruling in France. It decided to take the case before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose, asking it to find that the French ordinance is not effective in the United States. Judge Jeremy Fogel found the decision returned by the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris to be inconsistent with the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, relating to freedom of expression, and that consequently it is inapplicable in the United States. The LICRA and the UEJF appealed the decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 23, 2004, the Ninth Circuit reversed the earlier holding, after finding that the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over the appellants, namely LICRA and UEJF. The court quoted the following criteria for the establishment of personal jurisdiction as stated in an earlier Ninth Circuit case, Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v. Augusta National Inc.: The majority then concluded that: There was one dissenting opinion, written by Judge Melvin Brunetti, who argued that \\"a defendant's intentional targeting of his actions at the plaintiff in the forum state\\", which he viewed the French charges and fines as constituting, sufficed to give jurisdiction to the forum state, the United States, under the Supreme Court's \\"express aiming\\" precedent. The case created a media response and sparked a backlash of controversy in the United States, where many saw it as the censoring of a United States publication by a foreign power. Although technically the decision only required Yahoo! to prevent the sale of Nazi objects to people in France, Yahoo! has since chosen to remove the sale of Nazi memorabilia from its site entirely. Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et l'antis√©mitisme (LICRA) On 12 Jan 2006, the same court delivered an en banc judgment reversing the judgment of the district court and remanded the case with directions to dismiss the action.United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. - 433 F.3d 1199, Yahoo! Inc. v. LICRA and UEJF, January 12, 2006 The majority was split on whether to remand on ripeness or personal jurisdiction grounds.

[...] the extent ‚Äî indeed the very existence ‚Äî of such an > extraterritorial right under the First Amendment is uncertain.

History Mazzurana is considered as the symbol of an age of great progress from the civil and social point of view and from a more strictly economic one of the city and of the entire Trentino. Under his far-sighted guidance Trento was given a modern urbanistic order, became industrialized and realized meaningful cultural and social increase. Thanks to his charisma he realized a series of economic reforms in favour of the population, adopting a political \\"liberal\\" address and establishing a creative relationship with Trento, an Italian city in the Habsburg empire. Insofar as the action of Paolo Oss Mazzurana during the four podestarili periods comprised between 1872 and his death appears always supported from sturdy cultural and national ideals but also from solid economic bases, understandings to giving force to the demands for autonomy of the Trentino from the German Tyrol. The introduction of the electric power in the houses of Trento, the \\"democratic light\\", as he had defined, created workplaces and promoted the well-being of the popular classes, giving impulse to industrialization. At the same time Mazzurana promoted a series of studies in order to create an electrical tramway net, in order to permit workers to reach Trento from the surrounding area.

The company began as the Corning Consumer Products Company, a division of the glassmaker Corning Inc., and was also known as \\"World Kitchen\\" from 2000 until 2018. History The company began as an unincorporated consumer products division of Corning, Inc. in 1915 with the invention of heat-resistant glass bakeware sold under the Pyrex brand. It was incorporated as the Corning Consumer Products Company (CCPC) in the early 1990s as part of a larger reorganization and Corning contributed or licensed to the company substantially all of its assets used in the existing consumer division. In November 1994, Corning and the CCPC sold their European, Russian, Middle Eastern and African consumer products businesses to Newell. A major competitor at the time, they would serve as the exclusive distributor for a number of the company‚Äôs products in those regions. CCPC was spun off from Corning in 1998 and purchased by Borden. It acquired General Housewares and Ekco in 1999. As part of the sale to Borden, the company was required to shed the Corning name within three years. The World Kitchen name was adopted in 2000. In 2002 the company filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and underwent financial reorganization. , it has been privately held. Kenneth Wilkes was named president and CEO in August 2017, following a change in control in April to private equity firm Cornell Capital. that was preceded by a long period of organizational changes and operational restructuring. The company's website states it employs approximately 3,000 people, and has major manufacturing and distribution operations in the United States, Canada, and Asia-Pacific regions. On February 5, 2018 the company announced it had changed its name to \\"Corelle Brands\\" in order to take advantage of one of its most recognizable trademarks. In August 2018, Corelle Brands announced it would be investing $50 million over the next four years to update its Corning plant and expand its workforce. On March 4, 2019 the company announced it had entered into a \\"merger\\" agreement with Instant Brands, maker of the Instant Pot kitchen appliance, and Corelle‚Äôs chief executive will become the chief executive of the merged company while Instant Brands founder Robert Wang will become the merged company‚Äôs ‚Äúchief innovative officer.‚Äù Financial details of the deal have not been disclosed. On June 2, 2020, the company announced Ben Gadbois as the replacement for Kenneth Wilkes, who retired but will continue to serve on the Board of Directors. Domestic and international markets Corelle Brands products are typically sold in supermarkets in the USA, and by some high-end retailers catering to upper class consumers in parts of Asia, Europe, and South America.

Visions  Visions is a transparent cookware line created by Corning France in the late 1970s. In 1983, it was introduced in the US and became the number one selling cookware set for a number of years. Visions is made of Calexium, a transparent version of Pyroceram ceramic-glass. However, its lids have typically been made out of Pyrex (both Borosilicate and Soda-lime glass) in the US and Asia. Originally introduced in an amber color, a cranberry tinted version was available from 1992 until 2004. A white variation was available in Europe as \\"White Visions\\" and in the US in limited supply under the name \\"Pyromax\\". Visions was temporarily unavailable in the United States from 2004 until 2006 but has otherwise been produced non-stop for nearly 40 years.  CorningWare  Corning Ware casserole dish and other cookware pieces Originally introduced in 1958, Corning Ware was made in the US from a ceramic-glass material called Pyroceram which was able to withstand temperatures as high as 850 ¬∞C. Due to its high thermal shock resistance, Corning Ware could be used to store food in a freezer and then taken directly to a stove, placed under a broiler or in an oven (both conventional and microwave). Lids have typically been made out of Pyrex (both Borosilicate and Soda-lime glass) though some versions were also created out of Pyroceram. It was discontinued in 2003, replaced by a stoneware line of bakeware made in China under the same name. In December 2008, CorningWare StoveTop was released. It reintroduced the original Pyroceram product, this time made in France alongside Visions, and made available for purchase through their outlet stores and retail website. The Keraglass factory in France, which produces both CorningWare StoveTop and Visions, is one of the few still capable of producing ceramic-glass products. Product issues Pyrex-branded glass products have been the subject of urban legends and safety concerns. Beginning in the 1980s, production of clear Pyrex glass bakeware was switched from a more thermally resistant borosilicate glass to mechanically stronger soda-lime glass. The concern stems from the fact that soda-lime glass is more susceptible to breaking when exposed to sudden temperature differences. This change received greater attention after the Corning Consumer Products Company was spun off by Corning, Inc. The consumer affairs magazine Consumer Reports investigated the issue, in January 2011, confirming that borosilicate glass bakeware was less susceptible to thermal shock breakage than tempered soda- lime bakeware. However, they admitted their testing conditions were \\"contrary to instructions\\" provided by the manufacturer. STATS analyzed the data available and found that the most common way that users were injured by glassware was via mechanical breakage, being hit or dropped, and that \\"the change to soda lime represents a greater net safety benefit.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Corelle Brands, LLC website Category:Kitchenware brands Category:Glassmaking companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Cook County, Illinois Category:Rosemont, Illinois ","title":"Corelle Brands"},{"id":"3546086","text":"Lord George Murray (30 January 1761 ‚Äì 3 June 1803) was an Anglican cleric best remembered for his work developing Britain's first optical telegraph, which began relaying messages from London to Deal in 1796, a few years after Claude Chappe's system began operation in France.

An Institute for Noble Maidens () was a type of educational institution and finishing school in late Imperial Russia. It was devised by Ivan Betskoy as a female-only institution for girls of noble origin. Those were \\"Closed female institutes of the Office of the Institutions of Empress Maria\\". The first and most famous of these was the Smolny Institute of Noble Maidens in St. Petersburg. History=Origins Secondary education for girls and a path to university education for women was extremely limited in Tsarist Russia. One path of educational training for the daughters of the Russian nobility were the Institutes for Noble Maidens (Instituti blagorodnykh devits), cloistered private academies which housed primary and secondary students and offered basic scholastic and cultural training. Ivan Betskoy (1704-1795), originator of the state boarding school concept which evolved into the Institutes for Noble Maidens. The idea of the Institute for Noble Maidens dated to 1763, when Ivan Betskoy to Empress Catherine the Great a \\"Statute for the Education of the Youth of Both Sexes,\\" which proposed the education of both sexes in state boarding schools aimed at creating a \\"new race of men.\\"David Ransel, \\"Ivan Betskoi and the Institutionalization of Enlightenment in Russia,\\" in Canadian-American Slavic Studies, vol. 14, no. 3 (1980), pp. 327‚Äì328.

Regimen An important memoir touching upon life at these facilities was left by populist leader Vera Figner, who attended the Rodionovsky Institute for Noble Girls in Kazan from 1863 until 1869.See: Chapter 2, \\"The Institute,\\" in Vera Figner, Memoirs of a Revolutionist. Camilla Chapin Daniels, trans. New York: International Publishers, 1927; pp. 26-32. Figner found the educational regimen at the Rodionovsky Institute to be largely unsatisfactory, with instruction in literature avoiding controversial modern themes and history likewise skewed towards the ancient period rather than more modern events.Figner, Memoirs of a Revolutionist, pg. 27. Scientific instruction was said to be particularly paltry, with the zoology and botany instructor said to have > \\"...never showed us a skeleton, nor even a stuffed animal, and not a single > plant. Never once did we look into a microscope, and we had not the remotest > idea what a cell was... > > > On the other hand, for four years they tormented us over penmanship. For > seven years we had to study drawing, notwithstanding the fact that during > all that time not one of us displayed the smallest sign of talent.\\"Figner, > Memoirs of a Revolutionist, pg. 28. No discussion of contentious contemporary events or civics took place, according to Figner's testimony, with \\"not a word...spoken about serfdom and the emancipation of the serfs; or about land allotments and the redemption of the land.\\"Figner, Memoirs of a Revolutionist, pg. 24. Time was carefully structured, and virtually no textbooks used according to Figner, with students compelled to copy and recopy handwritten notebooks. Only three hours of free time were allowed during the day, with the only structured physical activity consisting of one hour of dancing per week.Figner, Memoirs of a Revolutionist, pg. 29. Outside reading was not encouraged, with the only library at the Rodionovsky Institute kept behind locked doors by a dean of the school and access to books by students very tightly restricted.Figner, Memoirs of a Revolutionist, pp. 29-30. Only six weeks a year were allowed for vacation time, according to Figner, during which the girls were allowed to return home ‚Äî and even this limited respite was denied girls in the two years as they approached graduation to avoid the possibility of inculcation of alien ideas or cultural influences.Figner, Memoirs of a Revolutionist, Chapters 2 and 3, passim. As a result, Figner asserts, \\"at the time I left the Institute, my mind was entirely free from any social or political ideas whatsoever.\\"Figner, Memoirs of a Revolutionist, pg. 36.

Weber is an Italian company which produces carburetors; it is owned by LCN.http://www.lcn.es/?lang=en History Eduardo Weber began his automotive career working for Fiat, first at their Turin plant (in 1914) and later at a dealership in Bologna. After the war, with gasoline prices high, he reached a certain success in selling conversion kits for running trucks on kerosene instead. The company was established as Fabbrica Italiana Carburatori Weber in 1923 when Weber produced carburetors as part of a conversion kit for Fiats. Weber pioneered the use of two-stage twin-barrel carburetors, with two venturis of different sizes (the smaller one for low-speed running and the larger one optimised for high-speed use). In the 1930s, Weber began producing twin-barrel carburetors for motor racing, where two barrels of the same size were used. These were arranged so that each cylinder of the engine had its own carburetor barrel. These carburetors found use in Maserati and Alfa Romeo racing cars. Twin updraft Weber carburetors fed superchargers on the 1938 Alfa Romeo 8C competition vehicles. Fiat assumed control of the company in 1952 following Weber's disappearance in 1945. In time, Weber carburetors were fitted to standard production cars and factory racing applications from automotive marques such as Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, BMW, Chrysler, Ferrari, Fiat, Ford, IKA, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Morgan, Porsche, Renault, Triumph and Volkswagen. In 1986, Fiat also took control of Weber competitor Solex, and merged the two into a single company (Raggruppamento Controllo Motore, or the \\"Engine Management Group\\"). This was then reorganized as Magneti Marelli Powertrain S.p.A. in 1986.https://www.magnetimarelli.com/company/history/1980-2000#20 Genuine Weber carburetors were produced in Bologna, Italy, up until 1992, when production was transferred to Madrid, Spain, where they continue to be made today. Actual owner of Weber brand is LCN.http://www.lcn.es/?lang=en  Modern use  In modern times, fuel injection has replaced carburetors in both production cars and most modern motor racing, although Weber carburetors are still used extensively in classic and historic racing. They are also supplied as high- quality replacements for problematic OEM carburetors. Weber fuel system components are distributed by Magneti Marelli, Webcon UK Ltd., and, in North America, by several organizations, including Worldpac, marketing under the Redline name. Other suppliers include Overseas Distributing, Pierce Manifolds & Lynx Weber in Australia Weber carburetors are sold for both street and off- road use, with the twin-choke sidedraft DCOE (Doppio Corpo Orizzontale E; \\"Double-Body Horizontal E\\") being the most common one. They are sold in what is referred to as a Weber conversion kit. A Weber conversion kit is a complete upgrade package consisting of a Weber carburetor, intake manifold or manifold adapter, throttle linkage, air filter, and all of the hardware needed for installation on a vehicle. Model codes Weber carburetors are marked with a model code on the mounting flange, the body, or on the cover of the float chamber. This begins with a number which originally indicated the diameter (in millimetres) of the throttle bore, but later lost this significance. If this number has a single pair of digits, both chokes are of the same diameter and operate together; if it has two pairs of digits separated by a stroke (e.g. 28/36), there are primary and secondary chokes that are opened one after the other, usually of differing diameter. These numbers are followed by a group of letters, which indicate various features: the DCOE is a sidedraft unit, all others being downdraft; the DCD has a piston-type starter valve as opposed to a strangler choke; and so on. After the letters there will be a further number, which may be followed by a letter, e.g. 4B, 13A; these indicate the series. The full designation might be 40 DCOE 29, 45 DCOE 9, etc. Copies Nowadays you can find DCOE, IDF or DGV carburetors from other companies, like EMPI or FAJS, usually with half price. Often these are called FAKEhttps://www.weberperformance.com.au/information.php?info_id=14 by Weber users. Both are manufactured in China and both are 100% copy, so all parts are interchangeable. Operation however may vary from the original.

In 1901, a series of stamps of 12 denominations was issued, showing a jumping tiger or an elephants. Stamps of the same designs continued were issued until 1934 in a large number of varieties. During July 16, 1900 to January 1, 1902, due to a shortage of stamps, stamps of the Straits Settlements were also used. The stamps of the Federated Malay States ceased in 1935 and were replaced by stamps of the individual states. Malayan Postal Union In 1935, the Malayan Postal Union was created, which included the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States.

MalaysiaMalaysian definitive stamps= Stamps are issued for all states of Malaysia, mainly definitive stamps of the same design, but with their respective state names. Definitive stamps are issued for use in all states only in high denominations (from 25 cents to 10 dollars). As for the low denominations (from 1 to 20 cents), stamps are produced for the individual states. * Orchid and bird definitives, 1965 During 1965 Malaysia issued its first definitive stamps. The stamps featured orchids for the State low values and birds for the Malaysia high values. Each State had its own set, identical with the exception of the State name and Rulers portrait or State crest as applicable. The eight high values were printed in portrait format, featuring Malaysian birds, and had 'MALAYSIA' printed on them in place of State names. * State low values, 15 November 1965 The stamps were designed by A. Fraser- Brunner. The thirteen states issuing stamps were: Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Sarawak, Selangor, Trengganu Proofs were also produced for Singapore, but the stamps were never issued as Singapore withdrew from Malaysia, becoming an independent country. The stamps were printed in landscape format by Harrison & Sons in England in two panes of 100, 10 x 10, with the cylinder numbers appearing on the right of the bottom margins, one for each colour, the left pane being numbered 1A and the right pane numbered 1B. There were two types of gum in use, Gum Arabic and PVA, the differences are clear to see, Gum Arabic being glossy and PVA matt. The colours were not produced by the standard four colour lithography method, cyan, yellow, magenta and black, but had dedicated colours as required by each value printed in photogravure. The left of the bottom margin contained colour check blocks, one for each colour surrounded by a black box, this black being for the State customisation black cylinder. The first issues were on paper watermarked 'Multiple SPM' upright and comb perforated 14 1/2. A few values appeared later on with watermark sideways and then later again without watermark. The values issued were 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents,6 cents,10 cents, 15 cents and 20 cents. Various proofs exist showing the individual colours and combined up to full colour proofs. In addition, each value was produced on Harrison proof cards in full colour. From the outset, there were problems with printing this issue as there are a number of missing colours present, in some cases more than one colour, indicating poor quality control. Some of the missing colours are now very difficult to find as in some cases only few stamps on a sheet were affected, generally 10 or less. Many of these varieties were the result of one of the printing colour supplies being interrupted during the print run and restarting, causing a missing colour on one or more columns. * Missing colours are known as follows: Johore: 1 cent grey, 5 cents yellow, 10 cents green, 15 cents green and 20 cents bright purple. Kedah: 1 cent grey, 2 cents yellow, 2 cents green, 5 cents black (country name & portrait), 5 cents red, 10 cents red, 10 cents green, 20 cents bright purple and 20 cents yellow. Kelantan: 1 cent magenta, 10 cents red, 20 cents bright purple and 20 cents yellow. Malacca: 5 cents yellow and 5 cents red. Negri Sembilan: 5 cents yellow and 5 cents red. Pahang: 1 cent grey, 5 cents red and 10 cents red. Penang: 5 cents yellow, 5 cents red, 5 cents blue, 5 cents blue and yellow, 6 cents yellow, 15 cents green, 15 cents black, 20 cents bright purple and 20 cents yellow. Perak: 2 cents dark green, 5 cents yellow, 10 cents red, 15 cents black, 15 cents magenta and 20 cents bright purple. Perlis: None. Sabah: 2 cents dark green. Sarawak: 1 cent grey, 2 cents black, 2 cents dark green, 2 cents yellow-olive, 6 cents black (country name & shield) and 10 cents red, Selangor: 1 cent magenta, 2 cents yellow, 5 cents yellow, 5 cents red, 10 cents red, 15 cents green, 20 cents bright purple and 20 cents green. Trengganu: 15 cents black (country name & portrait) and 20 cents bright purple. * medium and high values Eight values were issued for the medium and high values featuring Malaysian birds. The values were 25 cents, 30 cents, 50 cents, 75 cents, $1, $2, $5 and $10 and were intended for use in any Malaysian State. As with the low values, they were printed in two panes of 100, 10 x 10 with cylinder numbers 1A and 1B for the left and right pane, watermarked 'Multiple PTM upright' perforated 14 1/2. Various proofs exist showing the individual colours and combined up to full colour proofs. In addition, each value was produced on Harrison proof cards in full colour. As with the low values, missing colours can be found on a few values and inverted watermarks on the 25 cents, 30 cents, 50 cents, $1, $2 and $5 values. * Missing colours are known as follows: 30 cents, blue, 30 cents yellow, 50 cents yellow, 50 cents scarlet. Constant flaws can be found on most values, some of them being catalogued by Stanly Gibbons for the first time in 2013. * Butterflies definitives There were seven values for each state and eight high values inscribed 'Malaysia'. The states were: Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Sarawak, Selangor and Trengganu. The original state issues were printed by Bradbury Wilkinson & Sons in the United Kingdom, in sheets of 200 in two panes of 100, 10 x 10, for the values of 1c, 2c, 5c, 6c, 10c, 15c and 20c. The printing process was lithography. Colour separation proofs for each individual colour were printed for each value, and the colours combined in a process that eventually produced a full colour proof. These proofs were produced, initially, in small units, four or so and later as full sheets. This printing took place to ensure that all colours printed correctly when combined and also registered correctly. The more common sheet proofs can be easily identified from the smaller units as the latter have white borders. The stamps printed as sheets had a design that allowed for 'bleeding' between each stamp, printing over the perforations. Each value had two separate black colours, the first was applied as detail for the butterfly and the stamp value, being common for all States. and the second for the State name, Rulers portrait and/or State coat of arms, this being the 'customising' colour for the base stamps. In addition to sheet stamps, two values, 10 cents and 15 cents, were produced as coil stamps for use in vending machines in several locations throughout Malaysia. The designs were similar to the state values, but produced with 'Malaysia' in place of a state name as they were for use in any state. These coils were printed by Harrison & Sons in photogravure. From the start, the coil stamp machines proved to be inefficient at dispensing the correct values for the money tendered, possibly due to humidity affecting the stamps. Due to these problems, the machines were dispensed with quite soon after they commenced their duty. As a result, commercially used examples of both values are scarce. During 2006 a variant of the gum was identified. It is brown, with a clear 'ribbing' effect. This may have been a trial to overcome some of the problems with the machines, the ribbing possibly helping to prevent curling of the individual stamps. Harrison Proof Cards exist for both values with an imperforate stamp in full colour on each. * Harrison & Sons reprints During 1978, unannounced reprints for some state values were issued printed in photogravure by Harrison & Sons, the same printer that produced the coil stamps earlier. Some of these reprints are quite scarce, particularly the Perlis 10 cents and Sabah 20 cents values, as they were replaced by the new issue of Flowers and Animals the same year, and the new issue had not been announced by the post office. Once again, the stamps were printed in sheets of 200 in two panes of 100, 10 x 10. Unlike the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, these sheets had cylinder numbers in the bottom right margins, one for each colour and numbered 1A for the left pane and 1B for the right. These stamps can easily be separated out from the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, as photogravure produces edges with a 'fuzzy' look, caused by the photographic process when producing the printing cylinders. This can clearly be seen on the edges of the word 'Malaysia'. Bradbury Wilkinson printings have clear, straight edges. There are also differences in shade, but these are unreliable. There were two reprints, not all values being reprinted twice, and new values produced during the second printing. It is this printing that produced the scarce 10 cents value. The only proofs that have appeared to date are single full colour proofs on Harrison & Sons presentation cards, all values existing. It is considered that only two each of these cards would have been produced, one for the printers record and one for the Malaysian Post Office in Malaysia. * Agricultural and fruits definitives, 1986 During 1986, a new set of definitives featuring agricultural produce and fruit stamps were issued, seven low values for each State and eight medium and high values inscribed 'Malaysia' for use in any State. This issue proved to be the most complex ever produced by Malaysia, lasting for over 14 years, the last printing in the original format taking place during 2000. The issue is notable for the perforation, gum and watermark varieties. The low values were identical for each State, except for the state name, state crest and ruler, or state crest only for those States without a ruler. The stamps were printed in five colour lithography, cyan, yellow, magenta and black with grey for highlighting various areas and a browny-grey shade for the background panel. They were printed on phosphorised 'Multiple SPM' paper with a wavy pattern, in sheets of 100, 10 by 10 and had pink gum and were perforated 12 by 12 . The low and medium values were printed by 'Security Printers Malaysia' in Petaling Jaya, near Kuala Lumpur. The four high values were printed by Harrison & Sons in the United Kingdom. The low values had plate numbers, one for each colour used for printing, in the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right of each sheet, in the format 1A, 1A 1A etc., with colour dabs above or below each series of plate numbers. * State low values The seven values issued for each state were 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 15 cents, 20 cents and 30 cents. The 1 cent featured Coffee The 2 cents featured Coconuts The 5 cents featured Cocoa The 10 cents featured Black Pepper The 15 cents featured Rubber The 20 cents featured Oil Palm The 30 cents featured Rice =Malaysian commemorative stamps= The first commemorative stamps of Malaysia were issued on September 16, 1963 to celebrate the creation of the federation, showing a map of the nation. On 31 August 1982, Malaysia issued its first miniature sheet to commemorate its 25th. anniversary as an independent nation. The sheet was much used on first day covers and as a result sold out early. This was rectified by ordering an additional printing from the Austrian printer, Rosenbaum Brothers of Vienna, to satisfy the demand. Many years later, it was noticed that the first printings had a silver frame around the edges of the top left 10 cents stamp, this not being the case with the reprints, which had none. As a result, due to the high usage of the original sheet on first day covers, mint sheets with the silver frame are scarcer than used, and used without the silver frame are scarcer than mint. The silver frame is difficult to see, and is best viewed by holding the sheet at an angle to the light.

He is featured on the band's greatest hit, the 17-minute In-A- Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), recorded when he was 17. Biography A Boston, Massachusetts native and a violinist, Brann was accepted as a child into the prodigy program at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, but was soon lured away to become a rock guitarist, joining first Paper Fortress, then Iron Butterfly at 17. He played with Ron Bushy, Lee Dorman and Doug Ingle from late 1967 to December 1969. The first album from this lineup, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, sold over 30 million copies, was awarded the first platinum award and stayed on the Billboard magazine charts for nearly three years. With arrangement assistance from Dorman, Brann wrote the song \\"Termination\\", which was featured on the album. He also provided the lead vocal for the track. The album's mini-bio, written when he was 17, tells of an acting ambition he once had, clothing and food preference and the ease with which rock 'n roll artists were able to arrange sexual encounters (usually with groupies). It reads: \\"Although music has always been his one great love, Erik studied drama and before joining the Butterfly, his acting ability had landed him the lead role in a local play. ...Erik hopes to, one day, continue in the acting field. Right now, however, his only concern is the Iron Butterfly, turtleneck sweaters, bananas and the fairer sex.\\" In 1970, Brann and former Iron Butterfly member Darryl DeLoach formed Flintwhistle. This band performed live for about a year before breaking up. Between 1972 and 1973, Brann worked solely in the studio on various demos. In 1973, he recorded a couple of demos with MCA Records which can be found on bootleg sites. Notable songs from these demos include early versions of \\"Hard Miseree\\", \\"Am I Down\\" and \\"Scorching Beauty\\". In 1974, he was contacted by a promoter about reforming Iron Butterfly, so he reunited with Ron Bushy to form a new version of the group, signing with MCA. The 1975 LP Scorching Beauty featured Brann on guitars and vocals, Bushy on drums, Philip Taylor Kramer (Bushy's friend) on bass and Erik's friend Howard Reitzes (who worked in a music store frequented by Brann) on keyboards. The band also released Sun and Steel in late 1975 with Bill DeMartines replacing Reitzes on keyboards. Neither album sold well, and the band disbanded shortly afterward (around summer 1977). Between 1979 and 1990, Brann occasionally reunited with Iron Butterfly for concerts. He died in 2003 of a cardiac arrest related to a birth defect that he had struggled with for years.

Nepalnews 13 May 2010  History  In 1815, Nepal lost this region to the East India Company through the Sugauli Treaty. For 45 years it was a part of British India and returned to Nepal in 1860 in recognition for supporting the suppression of the Indian Independence movement in 1857. Today, this annexed area is still called Naya Muluk meaning new country. An area of was set aside as Royal Hunting Reserve in 1969 and gazetted as Royal Karnali Wildlife Reserve in 1976. In 1982, it was proclaimed as Royal Bardia Wildlife Reserve and extended to include the Babai River Valley in 1984. Finally in 1988, the protected area was gazetted as national park. The approximately 1500 people who used to live in this valley have been resettled elsewhere. Since farming has ceased in the Babai Valley, the natural regenerated vegetation makes the area a prime habitat for wildlife. Vegetation About 70% of the park is covered with forest, with the balance a mixture of grassland, savannah and riverine forest.Dinerstein, E. (1979) An ecological survey of the royal Karnali-Bardia Wildlife Reserve, Nepal. Part I: Vegetation, modifying factors, and successional relationships. Biological Conservation 15(2): 127‚Äì150 Abstract The flora recorded in the park comprises 839 species of flora, including 173 vascular plant species comprising 140 dicots, 26 monocots, six fern, and one gymnosperm species.  Fauna  The wide range of vegetation types in forest and grassland provides excellent habitat for 642 faunal species. The Karnali-Babai river system, their small tributaries and myriads of oxbow lakes is habitat for 125 recorded species of fish. A small population of gharial inhabits the rivers. Apart from the mugger crocodiles, 23 reptile and amphibian species have been recorded.  Mammals  One horned rhinoceros in Bardiya National Park The Bardiya National Park is home to at least 53 mammals including rhinoceros, wild elephant, Bengal tiger, swamp deer, and Gangetic dolphin. A rusty-spotted cat was sighted for the time in summer 2012. A fishing cat was recorded in Babai River valley in winter 2017. Rhinoceros: Translocation of rhinos from Chitwan to Bardia National Park commenced in 1986, with 58 individuals relocated until 2000. From 1994 to 2000, hunters have been unsuccessful at poaching rhinos. In April 2000, there were 67 rhinos in the park, most of them resident in the Babai Valley. In May 2006, a reconnaissance survey was carried out in the Babai River floodplain, which revealed an alarming decline in the rhino population. Poaching was suspected to be the main cause of this decline. Subsequent surveys in 2007 and 2008 have confirmed the complete disappearance of rhinos from Babai Valley. In different habitats of the Karnali floodplain 25 rhinos were recorded based on direct observation and indirect signs of rhino dung and tracks. They were mostly congregated in the floodplain grassland, riverine forest and wetlands.Thapa, K., Williams, A. C., Khaling, S., Bajimaya, S. (2009) Observations on habitat preference of translocated rhinos in Bardia National Park and Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, Nepal. Pachyderm No. 45 July 2008‚ÄìJune 2009: 108‚Äì113. In March 2008, only 22 rhinos were counted, and two of them were poached after the count.DNPWC (2008) Rhino Count - 2008, Nepal . Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, Kathmandu. The World Wide Fund for Nature reported that by 2015, the rhino population had risen to 29, mainly because of increased security measures.http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?262670/Rhino-translocation-off-to-a- positive-start-in-Nepals-Terai Elephants: In 1985, two large elephant bulls were spotted for the first time in the park, and named Raja Gaj and Kanchha. They roamed the park area together and made occasional visits to the females. Raja Gaj stood tall at the shoulder and had a massive body weight. His appearance has been compared to that of a mammoth due to his high bi-domed shaped head. His forehead and domes were more prominent than in other Asian bull elephants. In 1993, five elephants were seen entering the park, and one year later another 16 individuals arrived. A population count in summer 1997 revealed 41 resident individuals.Furaha tenVelde, P. (1997) The wild elephants of the Royal Bardia National Park, Nepal. Gajah: Journal of the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group 17: 41‚Äì44. In 2002, more than 60 individuals were estimated to reside in the Karnali floodplain and the Babai Valley.Bhatta, S. R. (2006) Efforts to conserve the Asian elephant in Nepal. Gajah: Journal of the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group 25: 87‚Äì89.  Birds  Peacock displaying his plumes Current checklists include 407 bird species, among them the Bengal florican, white-rumped vulture, peafowl, and bar-headed geese, which are symbolic of the park. Lesser florican and sarus crane are present; grey-crowned prinia, jungle prinia, pale-footed bush warbler, aberrant bush warbler, striated grassbird, golden-headed cisticola and chestnut-capped babbler occur in the park's grasslands.Kafle, M.

He is perhaps best known for being drafted by the New England Patriots in the second round of the 2000 NFL Draft, the same draft in which they selected Tom Brady in the sixth round. Klemm spent seven seasons in the NFL, winning three Super Bowls as a member of the Patriots. High school years Klemm attended Saint Monica Catholic High School in Santa Monica, California, and was a prep teammate of Marcellus Wiley and was named the Santa Monica athlete of the year as a senior. Klemm was a two-time All-League selection in both football and basketball. College career Klemm attended the University of Hawaii and was a four-year starter. He played under June Jones during his senior season (1999), and was a part of the biggest turnaround in NCAA history, as Hawaii improved from 0‚Äì12 to 9‚Äì4 and won a bowl game that season. Following his senior season, Klemm was selected as the starting left tackle at the Senior Bowl and also earned invitations to the East-West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl. Professional career Klemm was drafted by the New England Patriots in the second round (46th overall selection) of the 2000 NFL Draft. Klemm spent five years with the Patriots, appearing in 26 contests with 10 starts. Klemm was also a member of three Super Bowl champion teams during his time with the Patriots. Klemm spent his final professional season with the Green Bay Packers in 2005, appearing in 16 games and starting in half of those games for the Packers. Coaching career Klemm began his coaching career in 2008 as a volunteer with the SMU Mustangs, coached by Klemm's former college coach June Jones. In 2009, Klemm was named the offensive line coach and in 2011, he added the title of recruiting coordinator for the Mustangs. During his time at SMU, Klemm quickly became known for being one of the nation's top recruiters. Following the 2010 season, Klemm was named the top BCS non-AQ Recruiter in the nation by Rivals.com, and was further recognized by the outlet as one of the top 25 recruiters in the country overall. Fox Sports/Scout.com also named him the 2010 Conference USA Recruiter of the Year. In December 2011, Klemm accepted an offer to become the offensive line coach and run game coordinator for the UCLA Bruins under coach Jim Mora, Jr. In just a few short weeks on the job, he helped the Bruins bring in one of the nation's top recruiting classes and was named the Pac-12 Recruiter of the Year by 24/7 Sports. He was elevated to associate head coach in 2014. Klemm coached for five seasons before parting ways with UCLA on January 15, 2017. He and Mora were listed in three different lawsuits by three former Bruins players for mishandling injuries. After Mike Munchak was named the offensive line coach for the Denver Broncos in 2019, Klemm was named the assistant offensive line coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, replacing Shaun Sarrett who was promoted to offensive line coach.

It is arguably Australia's most famous steam locomotive, being the only one to have visited all mainland states and territories. Construction 3801 was built in 1943 by Clyde Engineering as the first of 30 38 class locomotives built to haul express trains. The first five were built by Clyde Engineering to a streamlined design, whilst the 25 post-war locomotives in the class were built by the NSWGR themselves at Eveleigh and Cardiff Locomotive Workshops and were unstreamlined. The 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction due to material shortages caused by World War II. 3801 was the first engine completed late 1942 and entered service on 22 January 1943 to little fanfare.First of New 38 Class Pacific Type Locomotive for NSW Railways Now on Trial Truck & Bus Transportation February 1943 page 46 It became known at the time as the Grey Nurse due to its drab, all grey colour scheme, a wartime camouflage scheme.New Australian Pacific Locomotive Railway Gazette 25 June 1943 page 646 In service Stanmore in 1945 On 25 February 1943, 3801 worked the Newcastle Flyer for the first time.The 38 Class Roundhouse July 1981 pages 22‚Äì29 When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the Melbourne Limited expresses between Sydney and Goulburn. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy overhaul and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A Waratah emblem was added to the top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that diesel locomotives started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the \\"glamour workings\\" away from the 38 class, the intention being to replace steam with diesel power, and to confine even modern steam to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. This intention was not realised until the end of steam on the NSWGR in 1972, as the available diesels were unable to match the speed performance of the 38s. In December 1956, 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres). In early 1963, 3801 was given a major overhaul during which it was repainted green. It was often used on special services operated by railway heritage organisations, the most famous being a non-stop run from Sydney to Newcastle on 28 June 1964.Sydney-Newcastle Speed Record Slashed Railway Transportation July 1964 page 5Record Run The Railwayman July 1964 page 3 Just failing to break the two-hour barrier, this remained the fastest journey from Sydney to Newcastle by rail (2 hours 1 minute 51 seconds) until bettered by an XPT in 1988.New Newcastle Speed Record Railway Digest December 1988 page 437 On the return journey 3801 again fell just short of the two-hour mark. In October 1965, the locomotive was found to have serious boiler problems, so was withdrawn and placed in the care of the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. The museum contributed $18,000 to return 3801 to service and the boiler from 3819 was fitted. In October 1966, 3801 returned to service.3801 Returns to Active Service Railway Digest November 1966 page 11 However the following year boiler problems re-emerged and the locomotive was withdrawn.3801 Withdrawn Railway Digest November 1967 page 8 Another boiler exam gave the locomotive a reprieve and allowed it to return to service. During this time it operated a train celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Newcastle Flyer on 31 May 1969, as well as the Western Endeavour special across the continent to Perth between 22 August and 12 September 1970. In October 1972, 3801 worked to South Australia with 3642 as part of celebrations to open the Whyalla line.Opening of the Port Augusta - Whyalla Railway The Recorder October 1972 pages 8-10Australian Steam Swan Songs & Special The Railway Magazine issue 861 January 1973 page 35 In April 1973 it ran to Melbourne with 3820.Melbourne Steam Festival Newsrail June 1973 pages 109-114 In 1974, the Public Transport Commission barred all steam trains from New South Wales main lines, however during June and July of that year 3801 was allowed back to be used as the star of the award-winning film A Steam Train Passes.A Steam Train Passes Railway Digest July 1974 pages 11-13 Preservation Central Station in Sydney in 1980 3801 under restoration at the State Dockyard Lithgow station in January 2006 Wagga Wagga station in June 2006 with a recreation of its original Grey Nurse colour scheme 3801 returned to service on 6 January 1975, operating services on the Bankstown line to help raise money for survivors of Cyclone Tracy. After this 3801 was deeded to the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. In June 1975, it hauled 5711 and 1905 from Enfield Locomotive Depot to Thirlmere when the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum relocated.Museum on the Move Roundhouse June 1976 page 16 The engine was then used on tours until December 1976, when boiler problems led to its withdrawal. In November 1982 chief executive of the State Rail Authority, David Hill, enquired about the suitability of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 Bicentenary of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 as a representative of Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the South Maitland Railways (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members ‚Äì 3820 and 3830 (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) ‚Äì and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however, the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began. With some finance raised, 3801 was taken to the State Dockyard in Newcastle on 20 November 1983 for restoration by the Hunter Valley Training Company ‚Äì an apprenticeship scheme later involved in the restoration of 3830. This was due to the railway's workshops being stretched by regular work. It was marshalled behind 8111 on an excursion train from Sydney.3801 Welcome back Railway Digest December 1986 pages 363‚Äì366 The firebox was to be completely replaced, however, the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox was used as a template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and reconditioning of many other components were also carried out. The tender tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986, a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to Maitland. More trial runs followed and on 29 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of Sydney Central station.3801 Hits the Tracks Again State Wide December 1986 page 1Re-Commissioning 3801 15th November 1986 Railway Digest January 1987 page 30Pacific 3801 Continental Railway Journal June 1987 page 312 After restoration 3801 operated heritage trains throughout New South Wales. It was operated by 3801 Limited under a 20-year lease. During the Australian Bicentenary celebrations in 1988, it operated an extensive program across Australia visiting every mainland capital accessible by rail including another trip to Perth in April/May 1988.\\"3801 West\\" Railway Digest July 1988 page 250 In October 1988, Flying Scotsman arrived from England and for much of its year-long tour across Australia was accompanied by 3801.Locomotive, Steam 3801 NSW Environment & Heritage On 6 May 1990, 3801 was involved in the Cowan rail disaster. 3801 was struggling to climb the Cowan Bank (on the Sydney side of the Hawkesbury River) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a CityRail Interurban passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including the driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied. In 1992 3801 visited Alice Springs for the first time, using the standard gauge track laid in 1980. The locomotive was awarded an Historic Engineering Marker plaque by Engineers Australia on 6 November 1994, the ceremony taking place at Robertson. 3801 was a regular at the Hunter Valley Steamfest. Despite a campaign by 3801 Limited to retain custodianship of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the custodianship passed back to the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum.Past Fleet East Coast Heritage Rail The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at the end of 2007. 2008‚Äì2020 overhaul 3801 in March 2020 after being repainted When 3801 was withdrawn in 2007, it was decided to replace the original boiler with a new welded one as well as conducting various mechanical repairs. This was timetabled to be complete by the end of 2010. The contract for the construction of the new boiler was let to Dampflokwerk Meiningen in Germany, while the tender tank was transferred to the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland for repair. In 2010, the new boiler arrived in Australia. Trial fitting of the boiler revealed a number of dimensional, manufacturing and technical issues which made it unsuitable for use. The boiler was subsequently returned to Germany in 2011.Locomotive 3801 Project The 3801 website features updates on the locomotive's progress issued by the NSW Office of Rail Heritage, with archived updates available separately.Overhaul and New Boiler, 3801 In May 2013, Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian acknowledged the importance of 3801 saying it would be a priority of the new not-for-profit company Transport Heritage NSW to return 3801 to service.Fixing the trains: A fresh start for Rail Heritage In November 2014 Transport for NSW announced that the German built boiler would be brought back to Australia so that local experts can get the locomotive back on the tracks.Transport for NSW update on steam train locomotive 3801 Transport for NSW 21 November 2014Update on Locomotive 3801 Transport Heritage NSW 21 November 2014 In September 2015, Transport Heritage NSW announced that 3801 would return to service in 2017 with the old boiler to be reconditioned by the Goulburn firm Ainsworth Engineering.Ainsworth Engineering to repair iconic 3801 boiler Goulburn Post 8 November 2016 In July 2019 the boiler upgrades were completed and the boiler was mounted to the frame.Controversial Pacific restoration passes huge milestone-now for the final push Heritage Railway September 2019 page 36 In September 2019 the locomotive passed its first steam test.First Fire in Australia's Scotsman Equivalent 4-6-0 3801 Steam Railway issue 497 September 2019 page 10 As a result of the firebox upgrades the boiler pressure was increased to the original 245 psi.3801 steams Down Under as overhaul nears completion The Railway Magazine issue 1423 October 2019 page 9 In January 2020 the locomotive completed a couple of trials in Chullora yard.Locomotive 3801 moves under own power for first time Transport Heritage NSW 7 January 2020 It then undertook two test runs each day from Chullora Railway Workshops to Glenfield before being transferred under its own power to the NSW Rail Museum at Thirlmere on the 25th.Locomotive 3801 returns to NSW Rail Museum Transport Heritage NSW 27 January 2020Well worth the wait as Pacific returns to mainline after 12-year restoration Heritage Railway issue 264 February 2020 page 18 Trial runs on the Picton to Mittagong loop line and the Main South line from Picton to Moss Vale occurred on 5 and 6 February.

Custodianship organisations=3801 Limited It was decided during 1983 restoration that a separate organisation needed to be formed to manage 3801 when it returned to service. In 1984, 3801 Limited was established to oversee the operation of the locomotive. The State Rail Authority, the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum and the Australian Railway Historical Society were former stakeholders. In 2005 RailCorp advised that 3801 Limited's fixed-term 20-year lease would not be renewed.

The play was first produced in 1988, and was published in 1994. Synopsis The play begins with Bill approaching Betty in a caf√©, asking \\"Is this chair taken?\\" To which she replies \\"Yes.\\" The bell rings and Bill repeats his question to which Betty says, \\"No, but I'm expecting somebody in a minute.\\" The bell rings again, and Bill poses his question again. This process continues until Bill is finally allowed to take a seat. The bell acts as a buffer against all topics of conversation that are potentially negative to building their relationship, allowing them to try another line. By the end of the play, their initial differences in opinion (i.e. literature, movie tastes, romance) have reversed to become perfect companions. Both of them finally agree to fall in love and cherish the other forever. Ives takes away any words or beliefs that could be offensive, whether they be sexist remarks or political affiliations.

In English, the traditional use was \\"the Ukraine\\", which is nowadays less common and officially deprecated by the Ukrainian government and many English language media publications.Ukraine or the Ukraine: Why do some country names have 'the'?, BBC News (7 June 2012)Why Ukraine Isn't 'The Ukraine,' And Why That Matters Now, Business Insider (9 December 2013) Ukraine (–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞) is the official full name of the country, as stated in the Ukrainian Declaration of Independence and Constitution; there is no official alternative long name.

After the Russian Revolution in 1917-1921, there were the short- lived Ukrainian People's Republic and Ukrainian State, recognized in early 1918 as consisting of nine governorates of the former Russian Empire (without Taurida's Crimean peninsula), plus Chelm and southern part of Grodno Governorate.

In the east the name Okraina (Russian: \\"Borderland\\") is used for Russia's southern border. The oldest recorded mention of the word ukraina dates back to the year 1187. In connection with the death of the Volodymyr Hlibovych, the ruler of Principality of Pereyaslavl which was Ky√Øv's southern shield against the Wild Fields, the Hypatian Codex says \\"Oukraina groaned for him\\", o nem ≈æe Oukraina mnogo postona).PSRL , published online at Izbornyk, 1187.

Thus, in the course of the 16th‚Äì18th centuries Ukraine became a concrete regional name among other historic regions such as Podillia, Severia, or Volhynia. It was used for the middle Dnieper territory controlled by the Cossacks. The people of Ukraina were called Ukrainians (—É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Ü—ñ, ukrajinci, or —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏, ukrajinnyky).–†—É—Å–∏–Ω–∞ –û. –í. –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ –ø—ñ–¥ —Ç–∞—Ç–∞—Ä–∞–º–∏ —ñ –õ–∏—Ç–≤–æ—é. ‚Äî –ö–∏—ó–≤: –í–∏–¥–∞–≤–Ω–∏—á–∏–π –¥—ñ–º ¬´–ê–ª—å—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç–∏–≤–∏¬ª, 1998. ‚Äî –°. 278. Later, the term Ukraine was used for the Hetmanate lands on both sides of the Dnieper although it didn't become the official name of the state. From the 18th century on, the term Ukraine becomes equally well known in the Russian Empire by the geographic term Little Russia. With the growth of national self-consciousness the significance of the term rose and it was perceived not only as a geographic but also as an ethnic name. In the 1830s, Nikolay Kostomarov and his Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Ky√Øv started to use the name Ukrainians. Their work was suppressed by Russian authorities, and associates including Taras Shevchenko were sent into internal exile, but the idea gained acceptance. It was also taken up by Volodymyr Antonovych and the Khlopomany ('peasant-lovers'), former Polish gentry in Eastern Ukraine, and later by the 'Ukrainophiles' in Halychyna, including Ivan Franko. The evolution of the meaning became particularly obvious at the end of the 19th century. The term is also mentioned by the Russian scientist and traveler of Ukrainian origin Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay (1846‚Äì1888). At the turn of the 20th century the term Ukraine became independent and self-sufficient, pushing aside regional self- definitions In the course of the political struggle between the Little Russian and the Ukrainian identitites, it challenged the traditional term Little Russia (–ú–∞–ª–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è, Malorossiya) and ultimately defeated it in the 1920s during the Bolshevik policy of Korenization and Ukrainization.–ú–∏–ª–ª–µ—Ä –ê. –ò. –î—É–∞–ª–∏–∑–º –∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π –Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ // –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 34 (1) 2007. –°. 84-96Martin T. The Affirmative Action Empire. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001 Etymology= Mainstream interpretation as 'borderland'  Excerpt from Peresopnytsia Gospel (Matthew 19:1) (1556) where the word \\"ukrainy\\" (–æ—É–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã) corresponds to \\"coasts\\" (KJV Bible) or \\"region\\"(NIV Bible). ‚ÄúOukraina‚Äù was initially mentioned in the Hypatian Codex in approximately 1187, referring to the name of the territory of the Pereyaslav Principality and meaning ‚Äúoutskirts‚Äù, possibly being derived from the Proto-Slavic noun *kraj—å, meaning 'edge, border. The codex was written in the East Slavic version of Church Slavonic language. Several theories exist regarding the origin of the name ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù but the most popular one states that the name originates from the general Slavic word for ‚Äúborderland‚Äù, ‚Äúfrontier region‚Äù and ‚Äúmarches‚Äù which referred, most likely, to the border territories of Kyivan Rus. This suggests that it was being used as a semantic parallel to -mark in Denmark, which originally also denoted a border region (in this case of the Holy Roman Empire, cf. Marches). The Arabic name of Egypt, Mi·π£r, similarly denotes a border region. A 1648 map by Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan called Delineatio Generalis Camporum Desertorum vulgo Ukraina (General illustration of desert plains, in common speech Ukraine) Title of the 1648 map of Beauplan \\"Ukrainae pars\\" In the sixteenth century, the only specific ukraina mentioned very often in Polish and Ruthenian texts was the south-eastern borderland around Ky√Øv, and thus ukraina came to be synonymous with the Ky√Øv Voivodeship and later the region around Ky√Øv. Later this name was adopted as the name of the country. The etymology of the word Ukraine is seen this way in all mainstream etymological dictionaries, see e.g. Max Vasmer's etymological dictionary of Russian); see also Orest Subtelny,Orest Subtelny.

On a map, published in Amsterdam in 1645, the sparsely inhabited region to the north of the Azov sea is called Okraina and is characterized to the proximity to the Dikoia pole (Wild Fields), a posing a constant threat of raids of Turkic nomads (Crimean Tatars and the Nogai Horde). There is, however, also a specialised map published in 1648 of the Lower Dnieper region by Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan called \\"Delineatio Generalis Camporum Desertorum vulgo Ukraina\\" (General illustration of desert plains, in common speech Ukraine), attesting to the fact that the term Ukraina was also in use.General illustration of desert planes, in common speech Ukraine  Alternative interpretation as 'region, country'  In Ukrainian language (as well as Belarusian, but not Russian) the word for a country or a land is \\"Kraina\\". Ukrainian language does not have any alternative words for that term other than \\"Kraina\\". For example, foreign country ‚Äì —á—É–∂–∞ –∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ (chuzha kraina), own country ‚Äì —Å–≤–æ—è –∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ (svoia kraina). The use of the word kraina in Ukrainian language semantically is close to the meaning of partitioning than a border or an edge. In Ukrainian popular music song performed by Sofia Rotaru \\"Krai, mii ridnyi krai\\" (Land, my homeland), she definitely does not sing about a border. Another singer Siarhei Mikhalok from Belarus in his song \\"Rodnyi krai\\" (Homeland), he does not sing about a borderline. In Polish language, Armija Krajowa is not a border troops service either, but rather known as the Home Army (National Army). Some Ukrainian scholars, beginning in the 1930s, have interpreted the term ukraina in the sense of 'region, principality, country'.–®–µ–ª—É—Ö—ñ–Ω, –°. –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ ‚Äî –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞ –Ω–∞—à–æ—ó –∑–µ–º–ª—ñ –∑ –Ω–∞–π–¥–∞–≤–Ω—ñ—à–∏—Ö —á–∞—Å—ñ–≤. –ü—Ä–∞–≥–∞, 1936. –ê–Ω–¥—Ä—É—Å—è–∫, –ú. –ù–∞–∑–≤–∞ ¬´–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞¬ª: ¬´–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞¬ª —á–∏ ¬´–æ–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞¬ª. –ü—Ä–∞–≥–∞, 1941; –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—è –∫–æ–∑–∞—á—á–∏–Ω–∏, –∫–Ω. 1‚Äî3. –ú—é–Ω—Ö–µ–Ω. –§. –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ: —Ç–µ—Ä–º—ñ–Ω \\"–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞\\", \\"–í–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞\\" –º–∞—î –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥—É—Å—ñ–º –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–Ω—è \\"–∫—Ä–∞–π\\", \\"–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞\\", –∞ –Ω–µ \\"–æ–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞\\": —Ç–æ–º 1, —Å. 189 –≤ –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—è –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –†–°–†: –£ 8 —Ç., 10 –∫–Ω. ‚Äî –ö., 1979. Many medieval occurrences of the word can be interpreted as having that meaning. In this sense, the word can be associated with contemporary Ukrainian krajina and Belarusian kraina, meaning 'country' (see Translations, 'region of land'). Linguist Hryhoriy Pivtorak (2001) argues that there is a difference between the two terms ukraina —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ \\"territory\\" and –æ–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ okraina \\"borderland\\". Both are derived from kraj \\"division, border, land parcel, territory\\" but with a difference in preposition, u (—É) meaning \\"in\\" vs. o (–æ) meaning \\"about, around\\"; *ukraj and *ukrajina would then mean \\"a separated land parcel, a separate part of a tribe's territory\\". Lands that became part of Lithuania (Chernihiv and Siversk Principalities, Kyiv Principality, Pereyaslav Principality and the most part of the Volyn Principality) were sometimes called Lithuanian Ukraina, while lands that became part of Poland (Halych Principality and part of the Volyn Principality) were called Polish Ukraina. Pivtorak argues that Ukraine had been used as a term for their own territory by the Ukrainian Cossacks of the Zaporozhian Sich since the 16th century, and that the conflation with okraina \\"borderlands\\" was a creation of tsarist Russia. –†–æ—Å—ñ–π—Å—å–∫—ñ —à–æ–≤—ñ–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –ø–æ—è—Å–Ω—é–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞–∑–≤—É –Ω–∞—à–æ–≥–æ –∫—Ä–∞—é –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ —è–∫ ¬´–æ–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ –†–æ—Å—ñ—ó¬ª, —Ç–æ–±—Ç–æ –≤–∫–ª–∞–ª–∏ –≤ —Ü–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–æ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∏–∑–ª–∏–≤–∏–π —ñ –Ω–µ–≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∏–π –π–æ–º—É –∑–º—ñ—Å—Ç.

Use of the article was standard before Ukrainian independence, but has decreased since the 1990s.The \\"the\\" is gone, The Ukrainian Weekly (8 December 1991) For example, the Associated Press dropped the article \\"the\\" on 3 December 1991. Use of the definite article was seen as suggesting a non-sovereign territory, much like \\"the Lebanon\\" referred to the region before its independence, or as one might refer to \\"the Midwest\\". Trump discusses Ukraine and Syria with European politicians via video link, The Guardian (11 September 2015)Let's Call Ukraine By Its Proper Name, Forbes (17 February 2016) In 1993 the Ukrainian government explicitly requested that the article be dropped, and use of \\"Ukraine\\" without the definite article has since become commonplace in journalism and diplomacy (other examples are the style guides of The Guardian and The Times). Preposition usage in Slavic Plaque on the wall of the Embassy of the Slovak Republic in Ukraine. Note the preposition na in Slovak, and the preposition v in Ukrainian. In the Ukrainian language both na Ukrajini (with the preposition na - \\"on\\") and v Ukrajini (with the preposition v - \\"in\\") have been used. Linguistic prescription in Russian dictates usage of na. Similar to the definite article issue in English usage, use of na rather than v has been seen as suggesting non-sovereignty. While v expresses \\"in\\" with a connotation of \\"into, in the interior\\", na expresses \\"in\\" with the connotation of \\"on, onto\\" a boundary (Pivtorak cites –≤ –º—ñ—Å—Ç—ñ \\"in the city\\" vs. –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–ª—ñ \\"in the village\\", viewed as \\"outside the city\\"). Pivtorak notes that both Ukrainian literature and folk song uses both propositions with the name Ukraina (–Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ and –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ), but that only –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ should be used to refer to the sovereign state established in 1991. The insistence on v appears to be a modern sensibility, as even authors foundational to Ukrainian national identity used both prepositions interchangeably, e.g. T. Shevchenko within the single poem –í –∫–∞–∑–µ–º–∞—Ç—ñ (1847). –ú–µ–Ω—ñ –æ–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ–≤–æ, —á–∏ –±—É–¥—É / –Ø –∂–∏—Ç—å –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ, —á–∏ –Ω—ñ. / [...] / –ù–∞ –Ω–∞—à—ñ–π —Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ñ–π –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ, / –ù–∞ –Ω–∞—à—ñ–π ‚Äì –Ω–µ —Å–≤–æ—ó–π –∑–µ–º–ª—ñ (\\"It is the same to me, if I will / live in [v] Ukraine or not. / [...] / In [na] our glorious Ukraine / in [na] our, not their land\\") ([poetyka.uazone.nethttp://poetyka.uazone.net/kobzar/meni_odnakovo.html poetyka.uazone.net]) The preposition na continues to be used with Ukraine in the West Slavic languages (Polish, Czech, Slovak), while the South Slavic languages (Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovene) use v exclusively. Phonetics and orthography Among the western European languages, there is inter- language variation (and even sometimes intra-language variation) in the phonetic vowel quality of the ai of Ukraine, and its written expression. It is variously: * Treated as a diphthong (for example, English Ukraine ) * Treated as a pure vowel (for example, French Ukraine ) * Transformed in other ways (for example, Spanish Ucrania ) * Treated as two juxtaposed vowel sounds, with some phonetic degree of an approximant between that may or may not be recognized phonemically: German Ukraine (although the realisation with the diphthong is also possible: ). This pronunciation is represented orthographically with a dieresis, or tr√©ma, in Dutch Oekra√Øne or Ukra√Øne, an often-seen Latin-alphabet transliteration of –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ that is an alternative to Ukrayina. This version most closely resembles the vowel quality of the Ukrainian word. In Ukrainian itself, there is a \\"euphony rule\\" sometimes used in poetry and music which changes the letter –£ (U) to –í (V) at the beginning of a word when the preceding word ends with a vowel or a diphthong. When applied to the name –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ (Ukrajina), this can produce the form –í–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ (Vkrajina), as in song lyric –ù–∞–π –í–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ –≤—Å—è —Ä–∞–¥—ñ—î (Naj Vkrajina vsja radije, \\"Let all Ukraine rejoice!\\").See for example, Rudnyc'kyj, J.

He was the son of M.W.O. (Honorary) Flight Lieutenant Tarlok Singh Sekhon. He was commissioned into the Indian Air Force on 4 June 1967 as a Pilot Officer. Param Vir Chakra Award During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he was serving with the No.18 Squadron, \\"The Flying Bullets\\" of IAF, flying the Folland Gnat fighter aircraft based at Srinagar. On 14 December 1971, Srinagar airfield was attacked by six Pakistan Air Force F-86 jets of 26 Sqn from PAF base Peshawar. Flying Officer Sekhon was on readiness duty at that time. As soon as the first aircraft attacked, Sekhon rolled for take-off as No 2 in a two-Gnat formation, with Flt Lt Ghumman in lead, just as the first bombs were falling on the runway. Only delayed due to dust kicked up by the preceding Gnat, Sekhon lost no time in singling out the first Sabre pair, which was re- forming after the bombing run. The Gnat Leader, Flt Lt Ghuman, lost visual with his wingman just after take-off, remained out of the fight leaving Sekhon to handle the muddle all by himself. In the ensuing air battle, Sekhon scored a direct hit on one Sabre and set another ablaze. The latter was seen heading away towards Rajauri, trailing smoke. Sekhon, after being hit, was advised to return to the base. He is said to have flown in straight, wings level for some time, then going inverted, plummeting down, probably due failure of control system. He attempted a last-minute ejection, which did not prove successful, as his canopy was seen to fly off. The wreckage of the Gnat was found in a gorge, near the road coming from Srinagar town to the base, a few miles from the base. Despite many search efforts by Army and Air Force, his remains were never found due to the mountainous terrain of where his fighter went down, much to the disappointment of his wife and family. A detailed story of his effort has been mentioned in fairly detailed account by Air Cdre Kaiser Tufail. His skill was later also praised in an article by Salim Baig Mirza, the pilot who shot him down. The bravery, flying skill and determination displayed by Flying Officer Sekhon, against odds of 1:6, earned him India's highest wartime medal for gallantry, the Param Vir Chakra.  Citation  The Param Vir Chakra citation reads as follows: Honours Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon is remembered for his gallantry and statues of him have also been erected in many cities in Punjab. A marine tanker built in 1985 was named Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, PVC. Legacy and depictions in popular culture National War Memorial, New Delhi A statue in tribute of Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon was erected at the district court of Ludhiana (first erected at Samrala Chowk, Ludhiana) in the courtyard next to the flag pole. A decommissioned Folland Gnat fighter is part of the memorial and serves as a gate guardian. His statue along with a decommissioned Folland Gnat fighter has been placed in the Indian Air Force Museum, Palam.

A children's hospital is a hospital that offers its services exclusively to children and adolescents. Most children's hospitals can serve people from birth up to the age of 21. The number of children's hospitals proliferated in the 20th century, as pediatric medical and surgical specialties separated from internal medicine and adult surgical specialties. Children's hospitals are characterized by greater attention to the psychosocial support of children and their families. Some children and young people have to spend relatively long periods in the hospital, so having access to play and teaching staff can also be an important part of their care. With local partnerships, this can include trips to local botanical gardens, the zoo, and public libraries, for instance. In addition to psychosocial support, children's hospitals have the added benefit of being staffed by professionals who are trained in treating children. A medical doctor that undertakes vocational training in pediatrics must also be accepted for membership by a professional college before they can practice pediatrics. While many normal hospitals can treat children adequately, pediatric specialists may be a better choice when it comes to treating rare afflictions that may prove fatal or severely detrimental to young children, in some cases before birth. Also, many children's hospitals will continue to see children with rare illnesses into adulthood, allowing for a continuity of care.

McLeod and starring Bob Hope and Rhonda Fleming.Variety film review; March 18, 1959, page 6.Harrison's Reports film review; March 21, 1959, page 46. Based on a story by Robert St. Aubrey and Bert Lawrence, the film is about an outlaw who tries to kill an insurance agent who has been mistaken for him in order to collect on a big policy. Costumes by Edith Head. Plot Milford Farnsworth (Hope) is a bumbling insurance agent who unknowingly sells a life insurance policy to the outlaw Jesse James (Wendell Corey). Farnsworth is sent out West to protect the insurance company's investment by \\"protecting\\" James. James has his own plans to have Farnsworth killed while dressed as the outlaw, so that he and his soon to be \\"widow\\" Cora Lee Collins (Rhonda Fleming) can collect on the $100,000 insurance policy. Farnsworth avoids several attempts on his life while he and Collins fall in love with each other. After the last attempt is made on his life, Farnsworth impersonates the justice of the peace who is supposed to marry James and Collins. When Farnsworth and Collins make a run for it, they end up in a gun battle with the James Gang where several Western heroes make their cameos to surreptitiously help Farnsworth. In the end Farnsworth is victorious, marries Collins, and becomes president of the insurance company.

Set in California, the film follows a wrongfully convicted man who kidnaps a wealthy heiress and leads police on a lengthy car chase in an attempt to escape prison, while the news media dramatize the chase to absurd extents. It features Henry Rollins, Josh Mostel, and Ray Wise in supporting roles, with cameo appearances by Anthony Kiedis and Flea of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Chase was conceived as a direct response to Rifkin's 1991 comedy The Dark Backward, which performed extremely poorly at the box office. The film was shot in Houston, Texas and its soundtrack features alternative artists such as Bad Religion, NOFX, and Rollins Band. Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was considered a commercial success. Journalists generally criticized its forced script and subpar characters, but praised the film's use of satire to criticize the television news industry. According to Rollins, the film has attracted a cult following. Plot Convict Jack Hammond stops at a gas station in Newport Beach, California, where he encounters two police officers and a young woman. When the officers receive a car radio call that indicates the car Jack is driving is stolen, he panics and kidnaps the woman. Fleeing in her car, Jack learns that his hostage is Natalie Voss, daughter of a millionaire industrialist. Two police officers pursue them in a squad car with a television crew filming a reality show. The car chase moves onto southbound Interstate 5 as Jack decides to flee to Mexico. As the chase intensifies, two bystanders attempt to run Jack off the road in their monster truck, but lose control and roll the truck onto its side, where it is hit by a semi-trailer truck and explodes. The news media dramatize the car chase, going to such lengths as having a reporter hang out of the side of a van alongside the speeding car. Jack explains to Natalie that, while working as a clown performing at children's birthday parties in Sonoma, he was mistaken for the \\"red-nosed robber\\", a criminal who had robbed several banks while wearing a clown costume. A blood test sample improperly collected at one of the crime scenes proved Jack's innocence but its inadmissibility led to his conviction and sentence to 25 years' incarceration. During transfer to prison, he escaped the guards and stole a car, leading to their present situation. Jack's lawyer explains Jack's predicament to the media and tries to convince him to surrender to the police, but Jack believes escape is his only option. Natalie sympathizes with Jack. She shares with him her hate for her stepmother and that she seeks to escape from her dysfunctional family. As the chase continues, she begins to fall in love with Jack; the two have sex while he drives, and she suggests feigning being his hostage so that they can flee together to Mexico. They reach the San Ysidro Port of Entry and find it heavily blockaded. Jack continues to evade the police but eventually stops, telling Natalie that her life cannot be ruined by him. He releases her reluctantly to her father. After considering going out in a blaze of glory, Jack decides to surrender. As he is being arrested, Natalie takes a television producer hostage at gunpoint and releases Jack. The two steal a news helicopter and escape to Mexico, where they relax on a beach. Cast * Charlie Sheen as Jack Hammond, the film's protagonist * Kristy Swanson as Natalie Voss, Jack's hostage * Henry Rollins as Officer Dobbs, driver of the lead police car * Josh Mostel as Officer Figus, Dobbs' partner * Ray Wise as Dalton Voss, Natalie's father * Rocky Carroll as traffic reporter Byron Wilder * Bree Walker as news anchor Wendy Sorenson * Marshall Bell as Ari Josephson, Jack's attorney * Claudia Christian as Yvonne Voss, Natalie's stepmother * Natalia Nogulich as Frances Voss, Natalie's mother * Cary Elwes as news anchor Steve Horsegroovy * Flea as Dale, driver of the monster truck * Anthony Kiedis as Will, Dale's friend and passenger * Cassian Elwes as the producer of the police reality show * Ron Jeremy as a cameraman * Marco Perella as a police officer * John S. Davies as news reporter Corey Steinhoff * R. Bruce Elliott as news reporter Frank Smuntz * James R. Black as a police officer Production The Chase was written and directed by Adam Rifkin, who at the time was best known for directing cult and independent films like the 1991 comedy The Dark Backward. Rifkin conceived The Chase as a direct response to The Dark Backwards extremely poor performance at the box office. According to him, \\"I needed to make something that studio executives could watch and see money-making potential from. So, I wrote and directed, purposely, a really brightly lit, simplistic car crash movie that I wanted to be the polar opposite of The Dark Backward.\\" Although the film was released by 20th Century Fox, it was made with a relatively small budget of \\"a few million dollars\\". As a result, Rifkin considers it an independent film rather than a studio film. Although the film is set in California, it was actually shot in the Houston metropolitan area, Texas. Rifkin explained that shutting down a freeway in Los Angeles for a long period of time would have been too expensive. The opening scene, where Jack kidnaps Natalie, was filmed at a convenience store in Kemah, while most of the chase scenes were shot on a section of the Hardy Toll Road. Other film locations include the Mecom Fountain and the Houston Police Department headquarters at 61 Riesner. To reduce costs, part of the car chase was filmed in the middle of a traffic stream during an actual Houston rush hour without clearance and with no stunt drivers filling in for actors Charlie Sheen and Henry Rollins. During the film's production, Sheen was also training for his role in Major League II. Rollins, a former vocalist of the punk rock band Black Flag, was cast as an attention-seeking cop due to his muscled physique. The role proved to be exciting for Rollins, who used to sing about police brutality. Musicians Anthony Kiedis and Flea of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers had cameo roles in the film. Flea commented positively on his experience in creating their characters. According to him, \\"We were making up lines the whole time. I remember we said something about Geraldo Rivera and we called him Jeraldo. We thought that was so funny.\\" Pornographic actor Ron Jeremy also had a cameo appearance as a cameraman. The film's soundtrack features alternative artists such as Bad Religion, Rancid, The Offspring, Down by Law, NOFX, Rollins Band, Suede, and One Dove. A soundtrack album by Epitaph Records was originally intended to be released in March 1994. Release The Chase performed well when it opened on March 4, 1994 in 1,633 theaters, finishing fifth and grossing $3.4 million at the US weekend box office, behind Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Greedy, On Deadly Ground, and Sugar Hill. During its second weekend, the film grossed an estimated $1.7 million, finishing in 13th place. Overall, The Chase went on to make $7.9 million in the US. Considering its limited budget, Rifkin felt the film was a commercial success, stating that it made \\"a huge profit\\" for 20th Century Fox. The Chase was released on VHS in the United States by Fox Video on August 3, 1994, and on DVD on September 6, 2005. The DVD's only supplemental material is the film's original theatrical trailer. Critical reception According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Chase has a 37% approval rating based on 19 reviews. Although the film was generally criticized for its forced script and subpar characters, several critics praised the film's use of satire to criticize the television news industry. The film also criticizes millionaire businessmen like the character of Dalton Voss, who uses the kidnapping of his daughter as a political advantage while he runs for the government of California. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film two-and-a- half out of three stars, felt that The Chase was \\"slick, charming, and with moments of real wit\\". He also praised Swanson's \\"unaffected charm and Sheen's ability to play an almost impossible role in a fairly straight style\\". Film critic James Berardinelli agreed, stating that Sheen develops \\"a surprisingly effective chemistry\\" with Swanson, and noted that Rifkin's use of satire is \\"far more perceptive than one might expect from a piece of cartoon fluff like this\\". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, editor John Petrakis noted the film's numerous gags and political and socio-economic commentary, stating that they parody films such as Smokey and the Bandit and Convoy, but said that its simplistic premise does not allow for an effective love story. Stephen Holden of The New York Times, while criticizing the film's superficial characters, remarked that The Chase \\"still detonates laughs\\". Although Swanson's performance was highlighted, Variety writer Brian Lowry felt that the \\"whining Valley girl aspects of her role\\" does not contribute to her characterization. He also described Sheen's performance as the same \\"Jack Nicholson-wannabe pose he's employed with varying degrees of success\\" in films such as Major League and Navy SEALs. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle agreed, but noted that Sheen's \\"familial transparency serves him well\\" in the film. He concluded that, while The Chase is \\"nobody's idea of excellence in cinema\\", \\"Rifkin's skewed world view suits this rollicking, stupid slab of celluloid just fine. It's big, it's dumb, it's fun.\\" In December 1994, The Palm Beach Post included he film in its list of the worst films of the year. Legacy Retrospectively, The Chase was considered ahead of its time because it was released before O. J. Simpson's infamous White Bronco chase in June 1994. The film was highlighted for \\"taking a look at the growing infatuation that the media had with tabloid journalism, and specifically the need for TV news crews to capture and speculate upon every minor freeway chase that happened in California.\\" The film was released at a time when road movies were considered appealing, hence the film's tagline reads: \\"Getting there is twice the fun.\\" In 2015, Rollins stated that The Chase had attracted a cult following and that he had always received mail about it when the film airs on TV.

He is a member of the prominent Chamorro family that provided five of Nicaragua's past presidents.http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/470 Early life Edgar Chamorro is the son of Julio Chamorro Benard and Dolores \\"Lola\\" Coronel Urtecho, the paternal grandson of Filadelfo Chamorro Bola√±os and Bertha Benard Vivas and great-grandson of Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro y Alfaro, 39th President of Nicaragua, and Mar√≠a de la Luz Bola√±os Benda√±a. He has six brothers and four sisters, and is the nephew of intellectual Jos√© Coronel Urtecho. In 1950, 19-year-old Chamorro began studying for the Jesuit priesthood, earning degrees from Ecuador's Catholic University, Saint Louis University, and Marquette University. Chamorro joined the faculty of the Jesuit-run University of Central America, before leaving the priesthood in 1969. He got another degree from Harvard University in 1972 and founded a public relations and marketing firm, Creative Publicity, in Managua. In 1977, Anastasio Somoza Debayle appointed him to a figurehead post as a special ambassador to the United Nations General Assembly for a year. Activities during Nicaraguan civil war During the Sandinista Revolution, Chamorro sympathized with the rebels, at one point hiding Sergio Ram√≠rez from the National Guard. But as the civil war's climax brought fierce fighting to the capital itself, fears for his family's safety led him to leave for Miami, Florida on June 17, 1979. Somoza fell a month later, but after visiting Nicaragua in September, Chamorro decided to remain in Miami. By late 1979, Chamorro had become involved in the anti-Sandinista activities of the Miami exile community. He joined the Nicaraguan Democratic Union (UDN), formed the next year by Jos√© Francisco Cardenal, which merged into the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) in August 1981. He served on the FDN's political executive committee, which decided to replace Cardenal with a new political directorate. Chamorro was tapped to be a member of the directorate, unveiled at a December 8, 1982 press conference. With his public relations experience, he took on a spokesman role for the FDN, and based himself in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to liaison with journalists covering the war. Chamorro claimed that the CIA prepped him before press conferences and told him to deny that the group had received any funding from the US government. Chamorro was miffed when the FDN directorate, at the CIA's prompting, appointed Adolfo Calero as its president in October 1983. His not- so-private grumblings that his Chamorro lineage was more illustrious than Calero's did not help their deteriorating relations.Glenn Garvin, Everybody Had His Own Gringo: The CIA and the Contras, Brassey's (US), 1992, p. 132, ; Cruz, Arturo Jr., Memoirs of a Counter-Revolutionary: Life With the Contras, the Sandinistas, and the CIA, Doubleday, 1989, p. 176, . Chamorro was forced out in November 1984, in the fallout from the furor over the CIA's Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare, labeled by the press a \\"murder manual.\\" He turned against the rebel movement, even submitting an affidavit for the Sandinista government before the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. United States. After the war Chamorro is author of Packaging the Contras: A Case of C.I.A. Disinformation (1987).

Originating in 1300 under the auspices of the Duchy of Brabant, the castle's present configuration dates to 1357. It was twice sacked and was subject to significant restorations in 1491 and 1617. Its present condition owes much to a major restoration in 1928‚Äì39. Built largely of brick, a rare material for such buildings at the time, around a circular enceinte, its major feature is its three large towers. Today it is open to the public and is considered one of Belgium's best-preserved castles. History=Construction and history Beersel was located at the frontier of the Duchy of Brabant within the County of Hainaut, south-west of Brabant's principal city of Brussels and near Halle. A fortified residence at the site was attested as early as 1292. In 1300, however, Godefroid of Hellebeke, the first known Seigneur of Beersel, received permission from Jean II, Duke of Brabant, to build a fortification on the present site near his residence. It became one of several Brabantine fortifications in the area, including Gaasbeek Castle. In 1356, during the War of the Brabant Succession (1356‚Äì57), the original castle was besieged by soldiers from the County of Flanders, led by Louis of Male who captured and sacked it. Beersel Castle was rebuilt from 1357 with a circular enceinte. It had three large and one small tower. During the 14th century, ownership of the castle passed to the Seigneurs of Wittem (Witthem). Henry III of Wittem supported Emperor Maximilian during the revolts of 1483‚Äì1492, placing him at odds with Brussels which supported the rebellion. Beersel Castle was besieged by Brussels militias twice in 1488 and 1489. During the second siege, the castle was attacked with cannons provided to the rebels by Louis XI of France and fell after several days, sustaining significant damage especially at its southern side. After the defeat of Brussels, ownership of the Castle of Beersel was returned to the Seigneur of Wittem. Maximilian ordered the Brussels to restore to the castle at the city's own expense. This restoration, begun in 1491, converted the three main towers to accommodate cannons. However, the military obsolescence of castles meant that Beersel became a private residence in the 16th century, losing its military function. In 1581‚Äì1606, the took up residence in the castle and restoration in 1617 added tiled roofs to the towers and ramparts. In 1796, the castle became unoccupied and began to deteriorate. In 1818, a cotton factory was created at the site. The property passed through a series of Belgian noble families over the following years and fell into ruin. The French poet and writer Victor Hugo visited in 1877 and wrote a verse about the castle.

A significant period of restoration began in 1928 and concluded in 1939 which restored the three towers and some of the ramparts to their post-1617 appearance. However, the residential building and the eastern face of the castle had deteriorated significantly and was not reconstructed. The castle was added to the list of scheduled historical monuments in 1934. Since 1948, it has been the property of the Royal Association of Historic Residences and Gardens in Belgium (Koninklijke Vereniging der Historische Woonsteden en Tuinen van Belgi√´) which has leased it to the municipal authorities of Beersel. The castle is open to the public, and was subject to a government-supported restoration project between 2008 and 2012. It is located near to the E19 motorway and adjacent to the Line 26 railway whose raised bank passes close to the castle's southern and eastern sides.

George was the son of the king Bagrat V and his first wife Elene of Trebizond (died of bubonic plague, 1366). Bagrat appointed him co-ruler in 1369. In November 1386, King Bagrat was defeated and taken prisoner by the Mongol warlord Timur Leng. Prince George organized a successful resistance to the next incursion and released his father. In 1393, Bagrat died and George assumed full royal powers. He spent most of his reign fighting Timur who led seven more expeditions against the stubborn Georgian kingdom from 1387 to 1403, leaving the country in ruins. Finally, in 1403 George had to make peace with the fierce enemy, recognising Timur as a suzerain and paying him tribute, but retaining the right to be crowned as a Christian monarch. He was killed in battle against the Turkmen nomads, apparently of the Kara Koyunlu clan. George VII may have died childless, as his brother, Constantine I became the next king.

He was the first living recipient of the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration. Born in 1918, Rane served in the British Indian Army during the Second World War. He remained in the military during the post-war period and was commissioned in the Bombay Sappers Regiment of the Indian Army's Corps of Engineers on 15 December 1947. In April 1948, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, Rane played a key role in the capture of Rajauri by Indian forces by being instrumental in clearing several roadblocks and minefields. His actions helped clear the way for advancing Indian tanks. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra on 8 April 1948 for his gallantry. He retired as a major from the Indian Army in 1968. During his 28 years' service with the army, he was mentioned in despatches five times. He died in 1994 at the age of 76. Early life Rama Raghoba Rane was born on 26 June 1918 in the village of Haveri in the Karwar of Karnataka. He was the son of Raghoba. P. Rane, a police constable from Chendia village of Uttara Kannada district in Karnataka. Rane's early education, mostly in district school, was chaotic due to his father's frequent transfers. In 1930, he became influenced by the Non- Cooperation Movement, which campaigned for Indian independence from British rule. His involvement with the movement alarmed his father, who moved the family back to their ancestral village at Chendia. Military career At the age of 22, Rane decided to join the British Indian Army, while the Second World War was in full swing. On 10 July 1940, Rane enlisted in the Bombay Engineer Regiment, and passed out as the \\"Best Recruit\\", awarded the Commandant's Cane. Subsequently, he was promoted to Naik (corporal). After his training, Rane was posted to the 28th Field Company, an engineering unit of the 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, he was promoted to havaldar (sergeant). After the war, Rane remained in the military. In 1947, following his country's independence, he transferred to the Indian Army and achieved the rank of jemadar (now the rank of naib subedar, equivalent to a warrant officer). For his persistence and leadership qualities, Rane was selected for a short-service commission prior to the partition. He was formally commissioned in the Corps of Engineers on 15 December 1947 as a second lieutenant (seniority from 14 January 1948). War of 1947 On 18 March 1948, Jhangar, lost in December 1947 to the Pakistanis, was recaptured by troops of the Indian Army, which then started to move towards Rajauri from Naushahra sector. On 8 April 1948, the 4th Dogra Battalion advanced to Rajauri. During the advance, the battalion attacked and captured the Barwali ridge, eleven kilometers to the north of Naushahra. The battalion's advance beyond Barwali was obstructed by the increasing number of roadblocks and minefields. Supporting tanks were also unable to cross the obstacles. Rane, in command of a section of the 37th Assault Field Company, attached to the 4th Dogra Battalion, was sent forward to help clear a path for the battalion. As Rane and his team started clearing a minefield, mortar fire from the Pakistanis killed two sappers and wounded five others, including Rane. Despite this, by the evening of 8 April, Rane and his surviving men cleared the minefield which enabled the supporting tanks to move forward. A safe lane still had to be prepared for the tanks as the road ahead was still dangerous; the Pakistani forces had yet to be cleared from the area. This lane was created by Rane through the night. The next day, his section worked for twelve continuous hours to clear mines and roadblocks. As the road was still too difficult to deal with, he made a diversion for the battalion to forward. Rane continued this work despite ongoing artillery and mortar fire from the Pakistanis. On 10 April, Rane got up early and resumed work on an obstacle that had not been cleared the previous night. Within a span of two hours, he cleared the roadblock of five large pine trees in the midst of mines and machine-gun fire. This allowed the 4th Dogra Battalion to advance another thirteen kilometers until it encountered another major roadblock. The Pakistani forces were situated on the adjoining hills and able to fire on all approaches to the block, making its destruction problematic. Rane drove a tank to the roadblock and took cover behind the tank while blasting open the roadblock with mines, opening the road before the end of the night. The next day, Rane worked for another seventeen hours to open the road to Chingas, which lay half-way between Rajauri and Naushahra on an old Mughal route, and beyond. During the period from 8 to 11 April, he had made a significant contribution in the Indian advance to Rajauri. His work not only cost the Pakistani forces about 500 dead and many more wounded, but also saved many civilians in the area from Chingas and Rajauri. =Param Vir Chakra= On 21 June 1950, Rane's award of the Param Vir Chakra, for his actions on 8 April 1948 during the advance to Rajauri, was gazetted. The official citation reads: Subsequent career and later life After the war, Rane was promoted to lieutenant on 14 January 1950 and to captain on 14 January 1954. On 27 May 1955, he received a regular commission as a captain, with the service number IC-7244. He retired with the rank of major on 25 June 1968. During the course of his military career, Rane was mentioned in despatches five times. He was subsequently employed as a member of the civilian staff of the Indian Army. He remained in the employment of the army until 7 April 1971 at which time he retired from the workforce. He died in 1994 at Command Hospital, Southern Command in Pune, survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter. Legacy National War Memorial, New Delhi The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a Government of India enterprise under the aegis of the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of her crude oil tankers in honour of the Param Vir Chakra recipients. The crude oil tanker named MT Lieutenant Rama Raghoba Rane, PVC was delivered to SCI on 8 August 1984. The tanker was phased out after 25 years service. A statue in Rane's memory was unveiled in a ceremony on 7 November 2006 in his hometown Karwar at Rabindranath Tagore beach, Karnataka, alongside INS Chapal Warship Museum. It was inaugurated by Shivanand Naik, former Minister for Small Industries, and presided over then Flag Officer Commander-in-Chief, Western Command, Vice Admiral Sangram Singh Byce.

Usage Marathon runners under a space blanket In their principal usage, space blankets are included in many emergency, first aid, and survival kits because they are usually waterproof and windproof. That, along with their low weight and ability to pack into a small space, has made them popular among outdoor enthusiasts and emergency workers. Space blankets are often given to marathoners and other endurance athletes at the end of races, or while waiting before races if the weather is chilly.\\"General Guidelines for Recycling at Mass Participant Sporting Events.\\" AFMInc. 2008. The material may be used in conjunction with conductive insulation material and may be formed into a bag for use as a bivouac sack (survival bag).\\"Emergency Shelter\\" REI.\\"Full Wrap on Space Blankets.\\" Runner's World. 2005. In first aid, the blankets are used to prevent or counter hypothermia. A threefold action facilitates this: * The airtight foil reduces convection * Heat loss caused by evaporation of perspiration is reduced\\"How Body Heat is Lost.\\" Survival Topics. * The reflective surface inhibits losses caused by thermal radiation In a hot environment, they can be used to provide shade or protection against radiated heat, but using them to wrap a person would be counterproductive, because body heat would get trapped by the airtight foil. This effect would exceed any benefit gained from heat reflection to the outside. Space blankets are used to reduce heat loss from a person's body, but as they are constructed of PET film, they can be used for other applications for which this material is useful, such as insulating containers (e.g. DIY solar projects) and other applications. In addition to the space blanket, the United States military also uses a similar blanket called the \\"casualty blanket\\". It uses a thermal reflective layer similar to the space blanket, backed by an olive drab-colored, reinforcing, outer layer. It provides greater durability and warmth than a basic space blanket at the cost of greater bulk and weight. It is also used as a partial liner inside the layers of bivouac sacks in very cold weather climates. Space blankets are also used by the Taliban to hide their heat signature from NATO forces.Smucker, Philip. \\"U.S. soldiers' options limited to protect Afghans from Taliban.\\" The State.

He died of wounds sustained during the Battle of Trafalgar. Spanish explorer Jacinto Caama√±o named the Gravina Island in Alaska in his honor.  Origins and military career  The Gravinas were part of the Sicilian aristocracy, as they were directly descended from the Normans who conquered Sicily. He was the son of Juan Gravina y Moncada, Duke of San Miguel, Grandee of Spain, and Do√±a Leonor N√°poli y Monteaporto, daughter of the Prince of Resetena, also Grandee of Spain.http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/11283/federico-carlos-gravina-y-napoli His maternal family originated in Sicily, which was then part of the Kingdom of Naples and ruled by a Spanish Bourbon dynasty. With the help of his uncle, the Neapolitan Ambassador to Spain, he entered the Spanish Navy, as a naval cadet aged 12. He then served as Midshipman on board the frigate Santa Clara in Brazil. In the course of this voyage, he carried out his first command when obtaining the surrender of the castle of the Ascensi√≥n, located in a small barren island near Santa Catalina. In 1777 he survived a boat accident in the River Plate in which most of the crew drowned. In 1778, on returning to Spain, he served as a lieutenant aboard a ship suppressing Algerian pirates. He then obtained his first command ‚Äì the polacre-rigged xebec San Luis ‚Äì in which he participated in the Siege of Gibraltar between 1779 and 1782, capturing the British corvette . Bust of Gravina, Naval Museum of Madrid After promotion to Commander he participated in the expedition against Menorca (then under British control), distinguishing himself in the attack on the fortress of San Felipe. After this, and for other actions, he was promoted to Captain. In 1785 he commanded a squadron operating against Algerian corsairs. In 1788 he travelled to Constantinople returning the Ambassador Jussuf Efendi. While there he made and published various astronomical observations. After the death of King Charles III, Gravina took the news to the colonies, where his frigate Paz recorded one of the fastest-ever times for passages from Cadiz to the Spanish possessions in Central America. In 1790 he was given command of a ship-of-the line, the Paula, in which he took part in the evacuation of Oran. The same year saw him demonstrate his administrative talents for the first time. During the Nootka Sound Crisis, Gravina organised the formation of a Spanish fleet, the largest in 200 years. However, the crisis was eventually solved by diplomatic means. In 1793 Gravina, now second in command of the Spanish fleet, served alongside Admiral Hood in the Siege of Toulon. During this period of the alliance with England he also visited Portsmouth to study British methods and tactics. On his return to Spain he was appointed to command a squadron of four ships, with which he served in the Mediterranean taking an active part in the war against Revolutionary France. His flagship was the Hermenegildo (112). In 1796 Spain signed the treaty of San Ildefonso with France, making peace and later entering the war against Britain. Gravina served in a squadron under Don Jose de Mazarredo. In 1801 he was sent to San Domingo in the West Indies in command of the Spanish fleet during the Haiti expedition under the French General Charles Leclerc. In 1804 he was appointed Ambassador to France in Paris. He accepted this position on one condition: if war should break out he would immediately return to the military. While in Paris he attended Napoleon's coronation as Emperor, and established good relations with Denis Decres, the French Naval Minister. Gravina played a major part in the negotiations of the Franco-Spanish pact which put the Spanish Navy at Napoleon's disposal. For his services King Charles IV appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Navy, and Gravina returned to Cadiz to hoist his flag in the ship Argonauta (80) in February 1805.  Trafalgar  Horatio Nelson (right) in an illustration by Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, 1882 When Napoleon proposed to invade Great Britain, following the orders of the government of Godoy, Gravina was placed under the command of French Admiral Villeneuve, who took the Franco-Spanish fleet into Caribbean waters to confuse the British fleet. The objective was to allow the crossing of the English Channel by 180,000 men that Napoleon had waiting around Boulogne. The deception did not have desired effect. On its return the Franco-Spanish fleet was intercepted by a fleet under Sir Robert Calder at the Battle of Cape Finisterre, losing the Spanish ships Firme and San Rafael. After this they took refuge in C√°diz by order of Villeneuve, contradicting the original plan of Napoleon. The French soldiers never embarked, and were moved to the interior of Europe, freeing many of them to take part in the Battle of Austerlitz. He later moved his flag to Principe de Asturias. In Cadiz relations between the supposed allies were poor. Gravina and other Spanish commanders argued strongly with the French, who wanted to sail immediately, whereas the Spaniards recommended waiting for more favourable conditions. Gravina was also concerned about the yellow fever epidemic that had left his ships short of men, as well as the lingering resentment against the French, for their perceived lack of support at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. The fleet finally left Cadiz on October 20, 1805, leading to the Battle of Trafalgar the next day. During the battle Gravina, in his flagship Principe de Asturias, found himself attacked by three British ships at once. The main mast and mizzen were shot through, rigging and sails shot to pieces. At about half past three in the afternoon Gravina's left arm was shattered by grapeshot, and seeing a looming defeat, he managed to gather ten ships around his flagship and fell back to Cadiz under tow. Despite this Gravina was promoted to the highest military rank of Capit√°n-General de la Armada (Admiral of the Fleet), but he never fully recovered from his wounds and finally succumbed on May 9, 1806, aged 49. On his deathbed he said, \\"I am a dying man, but I die happy; I am going, I hope and trust, to join Nelson, the greatest hero that the world perhaps has produced.\\" Memorial service in remembrance of Gravina at the Basilica of San Francisco el Grande, 1870 In turn the Gibraltar Chronicle paid the following tribute, \\"Spain loses in Gravina the most distinguished officer in her navy; one under whose command her fleets, though sometimes beaten, always fought in such a manner as to merit the encomiums of their conquerors.\\" As Napoleon wrote in a letter of August 11, 1805: \\"Gravina is all genius and decision in combat. If Villeneuve had had those qualities, the battle of Finisterre would have been a complete victory\\". Gravina is buried at the Pante√≥n de Marinos Ilustres in San Fernando, Cadiz.

It deals with the reigns of Egyptian pharaohs Akhenaten and Tutankhamun and the Exodus from the perspective of a Hittite slave girl of Ankhesenpaaten. It draws heavily on Ahmed Osman's theory that Moses and Akhenaten were the same person. The idea of Akhenaten as the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars starting with Sigmund Freud's views in Moses and Monotheism.Freud, S.

In May 2018, he was one of the eleven cricketers to play in Ireland's first Test match, against Pakistan. In November 2018, he was named the Men's International Player of the Year at the annual Cricket Ireland Awards. The following month, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland for the 2019 season. In November 2019, Murtagh announced his retirement from international cricket. Under-19s career He was part of the England Under-19 cricket team side for 2000 Under-19 World Cup held in Sri Lanka.

Domestic career He played for Surrey as a backup bowler. After injuries to many of the Surrey bowlers in 2005, he has found himself having to lead the attack on several occasions. Murtagh took figures of 6/24 against Middlesex in the 2005 Twenty20 Cup which at the time that was his best bowling figures in the short form games. Murtagh played in just two of Surrey's County Championship matches in the 2006 season and as a result, he searched for opportunities with other clubs. Across seven seasons at Surrey, Murtagh played 34 first-class matches scoring 874 runs at an average of 32.37 and taking 68 wickets at an average of 37.72. He also played 65 List-A matches in which he took 79 wickets at an average of 32.63.

Similarly his bowling average in List A matches for Middlesex is six runs less than it was for Surrey. Consistent in all forms of cricket and with a liking for the big occasion, he took 104 wickets in all three formats in 2008. Surprisingly, he was overlooked for the England development squad, but had his chance to shine in Middlesex's trip to Antigua for the Stanford 20/20 for 20. Together with Steven Finn he led Middlesex's attack in 2011 helping them win promotion with 80 wickets at 20.98. International career A conversation with Sussex and Ireland batsman Ed Joyce in 2011 led Murtagh to seriously consider qualifying for Ireland as his grandfather was born in Dublin. He applied for Irish citizenship in October that year, which was granted in January 2012. Ireland's first engagement after Murtagh qualified was the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier held in the UAE in March. Murtagh was named as a reserve in case any of the 14 players in the squad were injured. He made his debut against Australia in an abandoned One Day International (ODI) match at Civil Service Cricket Club, Belfast, in June 2012. He was also part of the Irish squad to play against Afghanistan where he played his second ODI in Dublin in July 2012. He made his t20I debut against Bangladesh. He scored 3 runs but did not pick up a wicket in three overs. Murtagh was selected in the Cricket Ireland squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup but broke a foot on 7 January, and had to withdraw on medical advice. He was replaced in the squad by Max Sorensen. In May 2015, Tim Murtagh and fellow cricketer Ed Joyce announced their retirement from T20 cricket. In July 2019, in the second ODI against Zimbabwe, Murtagh took his first five-wicket haul in ODIs.

He played college football at Duke and was selected by the Chicago Bears in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL Draft. Mannelly played with the Bears for 16 years before retiring in 2014. He is considered the top long snapper in modern-day football, a title given to him by sports columnist Rick Gosselin and special teams NFL agent Kevin Gold. Mannelly was also a midday sports talk host in Chicago on 670 The Score. High school years Mannelly attended Marist School in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was a letterman in football and basketball. In football, he was invited to the Georgia-Florida All-Star game after his senior season. Mannelly graduated from Marist School in 1993. College career Mannelly attended Duke University and was a four-year starter at longsnapper and a two-year starter on the offensive line. He missed a majority of senior year due to a mysterious hip injury. In Mannelly's final college game he went up against Mel Tucker; 15 years later Tucker would join Mannelly at the Chicago Bears and became the Bears defensive coordinator. Professional career The Bears drafted Mannelly in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL Draft. Per the Bears records he snapped the ball 2,282 times during his NFL career without a botched snap. In 2006, kicker Robbie Gould claimed that Mannelly played a pivotal part of his productive season, and praised him in his Pro Bowl acceptance speech. Gould considered him one of the NFL's unsung heroes. On September 27, 2010, Mannelly broke Steve McMichael's Chicago Bears record for most games played as a Bear, with 192 (the record now stands at 245, at the time of his retirement he was tied for 43rd most in NFL history). In a 2011 game against the San Diego Chargers, Mannelly ruptured his ACL, and was placed on injured reserve. In 2012, Mannelly broke the record for most seasons with the Bears with 15. On December 24, 2012, Mannelly signed a one-year deal with the Bears. Mannelly retired on June 20, 2014 after a 16-year career. Mannelly ended his career with 81 special teams tackles, the third most by a Bear since 1995 (when the statistic was first officially recorded), and the longest tenured player in team history. Life after football On September 2, 2014, Mannelly debuted with Chicago sports talk radio station 670 The Score as a co-host to Matt Spiegel. Less than a year later, Mannelly left the show citing a lack of interest in covering sports besides football. He will remain on the station as a football analyst. In 2019, Mannelly partnered with NFL agent Kevin Gold and trainer Chris Rubio to create the Patrick Mannelly Award, given to the best long snapper in college football. Personal life Mannelly was born to Jay and Patty Mannelly. His brother, Bernard, played college football for Notre Dame. He and Tamara John, the daughter of former Major League Baseball pitcher Tommy John, were married in 1998. The couple has one daughter who was born on Christmas Eve 2005. Mannelly is also a spokesperson for the American Lung Association's Athletes and Asthma program. Mannelly was a recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award on April 8, 2014.

The school can also lay claim to several famous cricketers. There is a unique ANZAC Day service each year that is compulsory for new students of the school to attend to commemorate the hundreds of Old Boys' that fought and died in the two World Wars. The school song 'Altiora Peto' has a third verse that is only heard on this day. In 2004 CBHS provided 2 of New Zealands 'top scholars', one of only 3 schools to do so with the other two both being girls-only schools in the Auckland region. Of note is the fierce rivalry Boys' High has with Christ's College and the annual Christ's College/Boys' High rugby match is a major event in any calendar year. This rivalry harks back over a hundred years to when the schools were not only the first two all male schools to be founded in Canterbury, but also conveniently situated within of each other. The new hall opening September, 2017 Of late, the school's cultural activities have gained some prominence, in particular its dramatic and musical productions where it often joins forces with its sister school, Christchurch Girls' High School.

It is originally from the Roman era, but has been rebuilt several times. Its current form was designed by Menno van Coehoorn, and improved upon by Vauban after the siege of 1692. It has been classified as a Wallonia's Major Heritage site. Its highest point sits at 190m. The original citadel dates to 937. It achieved its present extent between 1631 and 1675, when the city was under Dutch control. This section was called \\"Terra Nova\\" to distinguish it from the smaller M√©diane fort built adjacent in 1542 and ensuing years. A variety of subsidiary positions were built in the 18th century. It was disestablished as a military post in 1891, superseded by a new ring of forts around Namur that were calculated to prevent the city from being attacked with artillery. This ring became the Fortified Position of Namur in the 1930s. The Citadel was used as protected space for the PFN command post. Together with Dinant, Huy and Li√®ge, the Citadel of Namur forms part of the so-called Meuse Citadels.

The plateau lies within and takes its name from the historical region of Transylvania, and is almost entirely surrounded by the Eastern, Southern and Romanian Western branches of the Carpathian Mountains. The area includes the Transylvanian Plain. It is improperly called a plateau, for it does not possess extensive plains, but is formed of a network of valleys of various size, ravines and canyons, united together by numerous small mountain ranges, which attain a height of 150-250 m (500-800 ft) above the altitude of the valley. The plateau has a continental climate. Temperature varies a great deal in the course of a year, with warm summers contrasted by very cold winters. Vast forests cover parts of the plateau and the mountains. The mean elevation is 300-500 m (1,000-1,600 ft).

New Times publishes daily online coverage of local news, restaurants, music and arts, as well as longform narrative journalism. A weekly print issue circulates every Thursday. The company has been owned by Voice Media Group since January 2013, when a group of senior executives bought out the founding owners. David Hudnall was named editor-in-chief of Phoenix New Times in January 2020.  Founding  The paper was founded in 1970 by a group of students at Arizona State University, led by Frank Fiore, Karen Lofgren, Michael Lacey, Bruce Stasium, Nick Stupey, Gayle Pyfrom, Hal Smith, and later, Jim Larkin, as a counterculture response to the Kent State shootings in the spring of that year. Gary Brennan played a role in its creation. According to the 20th Anniversary issue of the New Times, published on May 2, 1990, Fiore suggested that the anti-war crowd put out its own paper. The first summer issues were called the Arizona Times and assembled in the staff's La Crescenta apartments across from ASU. The Arizona Times was renamed the New Times as the first college issue went to press in September 1970.  Arrest controversy  In October 2007, Maricopa County sheriff's deputies arrested Lacey and Larkin on charges of revealing secret grand jury information concerning the investigations of the New Timess long-running feud with Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio. In July 2004, the New Times published Arpaio's home address in the context of a story about his real estate dealings, which the County Attorney's office was investigating as a possible crime under Arizona state law. Special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik served Village Voice Media with a subpoena ordering it to produce \\"all documents\\" related to the original real estate article, as well as \\"all Internet web site traffic information\\" to a number of articles that mentioned Arpaio. Wilenchik further ordered Village Voice Media to produce the IP addresses of all visitors to the Phoenix New Times website since January 1, 2004, as well as which websites those readers had been to prior to visiting. As an act of \\"civil disobedience\\", Lacey and Larkin published the contents of the subpoena on or about October 18, which resulted in their arrests the same day.Sheriff's deputies arrest New Times owners. On the following day, the county attorney dropped the case after declining to pursue charges against the two. Special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik's subpoena included a demand for the names of all people who had read the Arpaio story on the newspaper's website. It was the revealing of the subpoena information by the New Times which led to the arrests. Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas dropped the charges less than 24 hours after the two were arrested. In the weeks following the arrests, members of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, of which the Phoenix New Times is a member, provided links on their websites to places where Arpaio's address could be found. This was done to show solidarity with the Phoenix New Times. In February 2008, the paper filed a formal notice of claim, which is required by Arizona law before suing government officials. In December 2013, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay Phoenix New Times founders Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin $3.75 million to settle their false arrest lawsuit against the county defendants.

Louis Th√©odore Gouvy (3 July 1819 ‚Äì 21 April 1898) was a French/German composer. Biography Gouvy was born into a French-speaking family in the village of Goffontaine, then a Prussian village in the Sarre region (now Saarbr√ºcken-Schafbr√ºcke, Germany). The family was of Belgian descent. Gouvy's great-grandfather Pierre came from Goffontaine, a Belgian village near Li√®ge. Around 1753, being mayor of Saarlouis, he named his ironworks factory \\"Goffontaine\\". Because this region fell under Prussian control shortly before his birth, Th√©odore Gouvy could not attain French citizenship until the age of 32. He began piano lessons with a private tutor at the age of eight, and was educated in Sarreguemines (France), developing a keen interest in Classical Greek culture and in modern languages. He spoke not only German and French, but English and Italian as well. In 1837, he went to Paris to study law, continuing his piano lessons with a pupil of the pianist and composer Henri Herz (1803‚Äì1888) and became friendly with Adolphe Adam. This led to further music studies in Paris and Berlin. Unable to pursue music instruction at the Conservatoire de Paris, he took up private courses. Drawn toward instrumental music rather than opera, this led Gouvy to live the last third of his life almost entirely in Germany where he felt more appreciated. In particular, he wrote twenty-four compositions for full orchestra,A. Rosenkranz (1902), (New York: Novello, Ewer & Co.), p. 51. . including nine symphonies, as well as overtures and variations. Chamber music comprises a large portion of Gouvy's work and accounts in particular for four sonatas in duet form, five trios, eleven quartets, seven quintets, an enormous piano repertoire, several scores for wind ensembles, as well as many melodies and Lieder. There are also five dramatic cantatas: Aslega, ≈ídipe √† Colone, Iphig√©nie en Tauride, √âlectre, and Polyx√®ne; two operas: Le Cid and Mateo Falcone; as well as some large religious works, including a Requiem, a Stabat Mater, a Messe br√®ve, and the cantata Golgotha. Gouvy was elected to the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1894 on the death of Anton Rubinstein, and to the K√∂nig-Preussische Akademie in Berlin in 1895. He died in Leipzig on 21 April 1898. A list of his works was compiled by Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis and Arthur Pougin., page 211 Important part of his compositions has not been published during his life. It is now the major aim of the Institut Th√©odore Gouvy. Appreciation Gouvy was a man of two cultures, divided between France and Germany, from which he drew his inspiration, his characteristics and his force. While to a certain extent he was known and recognised in his lifetime, he fell into obscurity following his death. During his lifetime, his compositions, and especially his chamber music, were held in high regard and often performed in countries like Germany, Austria, England, Scandinavia, and Russia, rather than France. Gouvy was universally acknowledged for being a master of form and for his deft sense of instrumental timbre. Mendelssohn and Schumann were his models. Virtually all of his works show that he was a gifted melodist. Musicians of the first rank such as Johannes Brahms, Carl Reinecke, and Joseph Joachim, who were familiar with Gouvy's music, held it in high regard. Hector Berlioz wrote in the Journal des d√©bats of 13 April 1851: \\"[t]hat a musician of the importance of M. Gouvy is still not very well known in Paris, and that so many gnats bother the public with their tenacious buzzing, it is enough to confuse and inflame the naive spirits that still believe in the reason and the justice of our musical manners\\". But Berlioz's favourable reviews had little effect, and Gouvy's music continued to be neglected until the end of the 20th century. In 1994, his Requiem, with its vigorous Dies ir√¶, was revived by the Lorraine Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Jacques Houtmann (who recorded a CD with the work, which appeared the K617 label). Stylistically the composition owes something to Mendelssohn, to Gounod, and to Verdi, but remains quietly original despite these influences.Grave of Th√©odore Gouvy in Hombourg-Haut. FranceAlthough his work comprises more than two hundred compositions, including 90 opuses published in his lifetime, it largely remains ignored.

She began operation in March 2004 and primarily cruises in Asia during the northern hemisphere summer and Australia during the southern hemisphere summer. She is a subclassed ship, which is also known as a Gem-class ship. Diamond Princess and her sister ship, , are the widest subclass of Grand-class ships, as they have a beam, while all other Grand- class ships have a beam of . Diamond Princess and Sapphire Princess were both built in Nagasaki, Japan, by Mitsubishi Industries. There have been two notable outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship ‚Äì an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus in 2016 and an outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. In the latter incident, the ship was quarantined for nearly a month with her passengers on board, and her passengers and crew were subject to further quarantine after disembarking. At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, and fourteen have died. Design and description Diamond Princess at Yokohama in 2014 June. The diesel-electric plant of Diamond Princess has four diesel generators and a gas turbine generator. The diesel generators are W√§rtsil√§ 46 series common rail engines, two straight 9-cylinder configuration (9L46), and two straight 8-cylinder configuration (8L46). The 8- and 9-cylinder engines can produce approximately and , respectively. These engines are fueled with heavy fuel oil (HFO or bunker c) and marine gas oil (MGO) depending on the local regulations regarding emissions, as MGO produces much lower emissions, but is much more expensive. The gas turbine generator is a General Electric LM2500, producing a peak of fueled by MGO. This generator is much more expensive to run than the diesel generators, and is used mostly in areas, such as Alaska, where the emissions regulations are strict. It is also used when high speed is required to make it to a port in a shorter time period. There are two propulsion electric motors, driving fixed-pitch propellers and six thrusters used during maneuvering ‚Äì three at the bow and three at the stern. The propulsion electric motors (PEMs), are conventional synchronous motors made by Alstom Motors. The two motors are each rated to 20 MW and have a maximum speed of 154 rpm. (Rated speed of 0-145 rpm.) In June 2017 Diamond Princess was retrofitted with a hull air lubrication system to reduce fuel consumption and related CO2 emissions. Construction and career The ship was originally intended to be christened Sapphire Princess. However, construction of another ship ‚Äì the one intended to be Diamond Princess (currently sailing as ) ‚Äì was delayed when fire swept through her decks during construction. Because completion of the damaged ship would be delayed for some time, her sister ship, which was also under construction, was renamed Diamond Princess. The name swap helped keep the delivery of Diamond Princess on time. She was the first Princess Cruises ship to be built in a Japanese shipyard, and the first to forego the controversial \\"wing\\" or \\"shopping cart handle\\" structure overhanging the stern, which houses the Skywalkers Nightclub on , and , and which was originally also a feature of prior to her 2011 refit. Prior to 2014, Diamond Princess alternated sailing north and southbound voyages of the glacier cruises during the northern summer months and in the southern summer, she sailed from Australia and New Zealand. Starting in 2014, she undertook cruises from Yokohama for Tokyo or Kobe in the northern summer season. For the 2016‚Äì17 season, she sailed round-trip cruises in the northern winter months from Singapore. Kota Kinabalu was added as part of her destination along with Vietnamese port of Nha Trang in December 2016. She resumed voyaging from Sydney for the 2017‚Äì18 season. After the 2018 Australia and New Zealand cruises, Diamond Princess was re-positioned into South-East Asia for most of 2018, varying between Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia.

Her maiden voyage took place on June 14, 2006, departing Red Hook, Brooklyn (New York) for Grand Turk (Turks & Caicos), Ocho Rios (Jamaica), Grand Cayman (Cayman Islands), and Port Canaveral (Florida). As of 2019, Crown Princess sails in the Caribbean during the Winter season, and in Europe for the Summer season. Like her sister ships and , her Skywalkers Night Club is built aft of the funnel rather than suspended over the stern as a \\"wing,\\" or \\"spoiler\\", as seen on . Her godmother is Martha Stewart. Galveston In December 2012, Crown Princess made a transatlantic crossing from Venice to Galveston, Texas where she stayed to run Caribbean itineraries from December 2012 to April 2013. When the ship arrived in Galveston on December 22, 2012, at least 102 passengers had contracted norovirus. The Crown Princess had previously been plagued by two separate outbreaks of norovirus in January/February 2012. Listing incident On July 18, 2006 at approximately 3:30 pm ET, one hour after departing her last port of call in Port Canaveral, Crown Princess reported \\"listing\\" or making \\"heavy turns\\".NTSB: Heeling Accident on M/V Crown Princess The United States Coast Guard was contacted shortly after and crews arrived within minutes to assist the troubled vessel. The cruise ship was on its way back to New York City, and the decision was made to return to Port Canaveral due to what was initially thought to be a malfunction in the steering equipment which caused a severe tilting of the ship, and injuries. However, the United States' National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the second officer, the senior watch officer on the bridge, had disengaged the automatic steering mode of the vessel's integrated navigation system after it put the ship into what the officer felt was an unusually hard turn to port and took manual control of the steering. The second officer turned the wheel first to port and then from port to starboard several times, eventually causing the vessel to list even more, to a maximum angle of about 24¬∞ to starboard. The severe listing tumbled passengers, crew members, pool water, and everything else not secured about the decks.I-Team: Cruise Ship's List Caused By Human Error Fourteen passengers and crew members were seriously injured, one suffering breathing difficulties after being hit in the chest by an airborne chair, and another 284 had minor injuries. Water from the four on-board pools poured into staircases and lift shafts. Most injuries were on the outdoor areas of Decks 15 and 16, where large beach chairs and tables hit and injured passengers. The other area that had many injured passengers was the balcony areas in the grand atrium. Many there were hit by falling objects and heavy marble tables. One woman who had an extended hospital stay was thrown against the glass wall on Deck 15 and covered by pool chairs and water from the pools themselves, being trapped underwater for several seconds. One passenger said, \\"Afterward it was like a war zone with people walking around bleeding\\" and another added, \\"All the windows were smashed. The top deck looked like a hurricane had hit it.\\" Rae, Charles (July 20, 2006). \\"Cruise Brits in 'Titanic' Terror\\". The Sun (UK), p. 9. The matter was referred to the NTSB and United States Coast Guard for investigation. After an internal review by Princess Cruises, its president Alan Buckelew publicly stated that \\"the incident was due to human error and the appropriate personnel changes have been made.\\" With approval from the Coast Guard and the Bermuda flag authorities, the vessel returned to service. A full refund was given to all passengers on the ill-fated cruise, and a 50% refund to passengers on the following cruise which was set to depart July 20 but instead departed from Brooklyn on July 22. Since then, Crown Princess has resumed her normal schedule. Cruising history Until November 2012, Crown Princess was sailing the Mediterranean. In November 2012 the ship sailed to Galveston, Texas for the first time; where she sailed western Caribbean cruises. In April 2013 she sailed to Southampton and operated cruises to Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Canary Islands. Subsequently, Crown Princess returned to the United States to Fort Lauderdale, sailing Caribbean cruises until February 2014. On January 18, 2013, it was announced that Crown Princess would sail around South America. The Caribbean cruises from February 15, 2014 through April 26, 2014 were cancelled to allow for the South America cruise. After the South America cruise, she sailed to Mexico, Hawaii, and Pacific coastal cruises from Los Angeles, as well as Northbound and Southbound cruises from Vancouver and Whittier or round-trip Alaskan cruises from Seattle. Starting in the 2016‚Äì2017 season she undertook a full season to South America. At the end of the season, she returned to Fort Lauderdale to sail Caribbean cruises. As of August 2019, Crown Princess is currently sailing the British Isles and will re-position to Fort Lauderdale for the 2019-20 Winter season, sailing Southern Caribbean itineraries.  Refurbishment  In April 2018, the ship underwent an extensive 10-day renovation in Freeport, Bahamas.

It commonly comes with a handle made of solid wire. Currently, it is often in use by American Chinese cuisine restaurants primarily throughout the United States, to package hot or cold take-out food. It can also sometimes be found in other Western countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Poland and England, but is rarely seen in China and other Asian countries with high numbers of ethnic Chinese.  Uses  The container has the advantage of being inexpensive, durable and fairly leak-proof as long as it is kept upright. The top usually includes a locking paperboard tab so that it is self- closing. The simple origami-like folded construction also allows for some escape of steam from hot food. If care is used to remove the flaps, and the sides are unfolded, the container can also double as a one-time plate. It is more typical, however to eat directly out of the container, a feat that the long reach of chopsticks readily permits.The containers are primarily used with American Chinese cuisine, though they have begun to spread in some European countries. Oyster pails that can be used safely in microwave ovens (without the metal handle, which can cause arcing in a microwave) are also available. Microwave-safe pails often come with no handle or a handle made of plastic. The containers may also be used for storing or transporting non-food items, such as soap bath beads or small parts. Takeout containers have also been offered as novelty packaging for small gifts.  History  Early patents date to 1890, 1894, and 1908. The paperboard oyster pail was invented at a time when fresh oysters were more popular, more plentiful, and less expensive than they are at present. Since shucking oysters (removing the raw meat from the shell) takes some amount of skill and can be difficult and dangerous, it was common to have the oyster seller open the oysters so they could be taken home for use in cooked dishes. The oyster pail provided an inexpensive and sanitary way to accomplish this. In the early 20th century oyster pails were also used to hold honey. In the mid-20th century, overfishing (and the subsequent rise in price) of oysters left manufacturers with a significant number of unsold oyster pails. An oyster pail box from a Chinese restaurant However, in the US after World War II, there was a huge increase in sales of prepared foods that could be purchased from restaurants, and heated or finished at home. Chinese food proved to be a popular choice, since it was tasty, unusual, fairly inexpensive and traveled well. The oyster pail was quickly adopted for \\"Chinese takeout\\". The paperboard pails were to some extent self-insulating, and could be used for a wide variety of foods including cooked rice, moist dishes such as egg foo young and sauced dishes, though they were generally unsuitable for hot highly liquid dishes such as soups. The containers are also used by restaurants offering classic American takeout food, such as French fries or fried clams, but the paperboard containers have become strongly associated with Chinese takeout in popular culture. In 2011, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History displayed iconic Chinese takeout containers in its exhibit Sweet & Sour: A Look at the History of Chinese Food in the United States.

Huangmei opera is one of the most famous and mainstream opera in China (others are Beijing opera, Yue opera, Ping opera and Yu opera). The original Huangmei opera was sung by women when they were picking tea, and the opera was called the Picking Tea Song. In the late Qing dynasty, the songs came into Anhui Province‚Äî Huaining County adjacent regions, combined with the local folk art, Anqing dialect with singing and chants, and gradually developed into a newborn's operas. The music is performed with a pitch that hits high and stays high for the duration of the song. It is unique in the sense that it does not sound like the typical rhythmic Chinese opera. In the 1960s Hong Kong counted the style as much as an opera as it was a music genre. Today it is more of a traditional performance art with efforts of revival in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and mostly sung in Mandarin. History Informal performance of Huangmei opera Mainland China The origins of Huangmei opera are not clear, and there is disagreement among scholars. About the only thing certain is that this style came from China. Generally accepted opinion is that the opera is from the junction of Anhui and Hubei and Jiangxi Province. It became a part of the operatic genre in the Anqing region of southwestern Anhui province. Anqing is the center of the opera and enrich the Huangmei Songs into a real drama. Huangmei opera did not involve the traditional opera gestures which often used the sleeves and step movements. It was also not performed on stage initially but as a kind of roving troupe performance. The Huangmei opera was active in Anhui Province, Hubei Province and Jiangxi Province in the 18th century. From the Revolution of 1911 to 1949, Huangmei performances gradually became professional, from rural areas to city stages. After Huangmei arrived in Anqing City, artists developed the opera and borrowed performance styles from other operas. They reformed the traditional chants, reducing the function words to make the drama easy to understand with a lively rhythm. 1952 is a key year for Huangmei opera. It was during this year that the excellent artists Yan Fengying, Wang Shaofang and others gave performances in Shanghai for a big opera festival. Audiences from various areas were shocked and appreciated Huangmei opera, attracted by its new singing forms and stories. Huangmei opera became very popular and famous after that. The big success evoked the passion of Huangmei opera artists and they created The Marriage of A Fairy Princess and Female Consort Prince which are classics. Hong Kong The theme of Huangmei opera began to expand with its initial introduction in Hong Kong via the 1959 film The Kingdom and the Beauty (). The artform is believed to have come from the massive wave of immigrants from mainland China to Hong Kong in the 1950s. The film that peaked the music genre was 1963's The Love Eterne.Berry, Michael. [2005] (2005). Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers. Columbia University Press. The audience was attracted by the rewritten music style which combined both Chinese and Western musical instruments. The tempo was also livelier and faster than the traditional opera. During this period, many Huangmei films were made, evolving into various forms and combinations, which later included wuxia sword fights. Because the genre has such a heavy association with romance films like The Love Eterne, it is sometimes preferred that the singing be done with a male and a female pair. There has only been a handful of big name Huangmei artists in Hong Kong. Betty Loh Ti and Ivy Ling Po, Tsin Ting are some examples. Costumes Huangmei costumes are generally less extravagant compared to the other Chinese opera branches. There is usually a greater emphasis on the singing than the display. In Hong Kong there is not necessarily a requirement to wear any traditional Chinese opera attire. An example is the cantopop artist Jenny Tseng singing Huangmei style music with Ivy Ling Po in a concert.
