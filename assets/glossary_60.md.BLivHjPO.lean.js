It claims that in the different Moorish Iberian kingdoms, the Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in relative peace. According to this interpretation of history, this period of religious diversity differs from later Spanish and Portuguese history when‚Äîas a result of expulsions and forced conversions‚ÄîCatholicism became the sole religion in the Iberian Peninsula. However, some voices have challenged the historicity of the above view of the supposed intercultural harmony as a \\"myth\\", with the argument that it depends too strongly on unreliable documentation., Qurtuba: Algunas reflexiones cr√≠ticas sobre el califato de C√≥rdoba y el mito de la convivencia [Qurtuba: Some Critical Reflections on the Caliphate of Cordova and the Convivencia Myth], by Eduardo Manzano Moreno, Awraq n.¬∞ 7. 2013, pp 226-246 According to The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages, \\"Critics charge that [the term 'convivencia'] too often describes an idealized view of multi-faith harmony and symbiosis, while supporters retort that such a characterization is a distortion of the complex interactions they seek to understand.\\" Cultural meaning La Convivencia often refers to the interplay of cultural ideas between the three religious groups and ideas of religious tolerance. James Carroll invokes this concept and indicates that it played an important role in bringing the classics of Greek philosophy to Europe, with translations from Greek to Arabic to Hebrew and Latin.Carroll, James (2001), Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews, Chapter 33. Houghton Mifflin, Co., Boston. Jerrilynn Dodds references this concept in the spatial orientation seen in architecture that draws on building styles seen in synagogues and mosques. An example of La Convivencia was C√≥rdoba, Andalusia in Al-Andalus, in the ninth and tenth centuries. C√≥rdoba was ‚Äúone of the most important cities in the history of the world.‚Äù In it, ‚ÄúChristians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city.‚ÄùAmir Hussain, ‚ÄúMuslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,‚Äù in Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism, ed. Omid Safi, 257 (Oneworld Publications, 2003). Mar√≠a Rosa Menocal, Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, further describes the libraries of C√≥rdoba as \\"a significant benchmark of overall social (not just scholarly) well being, since they represented a near-perfect crossroads of the material and the intellectual.\\" Menocal, Mar√≠a Rosa (2002), \\"The Ornament of the World: how Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain\\", Little, Brown, Boston. James L. Heft, the Alton Brooks Professor of Religion at USC, describes La Convivencia as one of the ‚Äúrare periods in history‚Äù when the three religions did not either keep ‚Äútheir distance from one another, or were in conflict.‚Äù During most of their co-existing history, they have been ‚Äúignorant about each other‚Äù or ‚Äúattacked each other.‚ÄùJames L. Heft, ‚ÄúThe Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy: The Catholic/Muslim Dialogue‚Äù The First Sheridan-Campbell Lecture Given at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, Malta, May 20, 2011. End of the Convivencia While the Reconquista was ongoing, Muslims and Jews who came under Christian control were allowed to practise their religion to some degree. This ended in the late 15th century with the fall of Granada in 1492. Even before this event, the Spanish Inquisition had been established in 1478. In 1492, with the Alhambra decree, those Jews who had not converted to Catholicism were expelled. Many Jews settled in Portugal, where they were expelled in 1497. Similarly the Muslims of Iberia were forced to convert or face either death or expulsion. This happened even though the Granadan Muslims had been assured of religious freedom at the time of their surrender. Between 1500 and 1502 all remaining Muslims of Granada and Castile were converted. In 1525, Muslims in Aragon were similarly forced to convert. The Muslim communities who converted became known as Moriscos. Still they were suspected by the old Christians of being crypto- Muslims and so between 1609 and 1614 their entire population of 300,000 was forcibly expelled. All these expulsions and conversions resulted in Catholic Christianity becoming the sole sanctioned religion in the Iberian Peninsula. As Anna Akasoy has summarized in a review article, Menocal \\"argues that the narrow-minded forces that brought about its end were external.\\" Debate The idea of the convivencia has had supporters and detractors from the time Castro first proposed Fancy Hussein, in retrospect, summarized the underlying assumptions on both sides of the debate over: \\"The convivencia debates were never about political ideologies or partisan politics, as they are often construed, but rather,\\" as Ryan Szpiech has argued, \\"about fundamental and unresolved methodological and philosophical issues. While Castro appealed to philosophical interpretivism, [Claudio] S√°nchez-Albornoz appealed to scientific positivism.\\" David Nirenberg challenged the significance of the age of \\"convivencia,\\" claiming that far from a \\"peaceful convivencia\\" his own work \\"demonstrates that violence was a central and systemic aspect of the coexistence of majority and minority in medieval Spain, and even suggests that coexistence was in part predicated on such violence\\".Nirenberg, David, Communities of violence ‚Ä¢ Persecution of Minorities in the Middle ages. Princeton University Press, 1996. P. 9. Mark Cohen, professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University, in his Under Crescent and Cross, calls the \\"idealized\\" interfaith utopia a \\"myth\\" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as Heinrich Graetz in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews. This myth was met with what Cohen calls the \\"counter-myth\\" of the \\"neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish- Arab history\\" by Bat Yeor and others, which also \\"cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality\\". Cohen aims to present a correction to both these \\"myths\\". The Spanish mediaevalist Eduardo Manzano Moreno wrote that the concept of convivencia has no support in the historical record [‚Äúel concepto de convivencia no tiene ninguna apoyatura hist√≥rica‚Äú]. He further states that there is scarcely any information available on the Jewish and Christian communities during the Caliphate of Cordoba, and that this may come as a shock in view of the huge clout of the convivencia meme [‚Äú... quiz√° pueda resultar chocante teniendo en cuenta el enorme peso del t√≥pico convivencial.‚Äù] According to Manzano, Castro‚Äôs conception \\"was never converted into a specific and well-documented treatment of el-Andalus, perhaps because Castro never succeeded in finding in the Arabist bibliography materials suitable for incorporation into his interpretation.‚Äù \\"[C]ontemporary ecumenicists appeal to the 'Golden Age' of tolerance\\" in the 10th and 11th centuries in C√≥rdoba under Muslim rule, but, for the most part, they are not interested in what actually happened among the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Rather, they mention \\"tolerance\\", a concept that \\"would have had little or no meaning\\" at that time.

He also works overnight as a supervisor at a distribution center. Personal life Bonsante is a father of two children. Boxing career=On TV's \\"The Contender\\" He was a contestant on reality TV show The Contender, shortly before which he fought future contestant Peter Manfredo and lost. That fight was Manfredo's first defence of the WBO and NABA Light Middleweight Titles. Bonsante had previously won a fight for the vacant IBU Super Middleweight Title. On the show, he was placed on the West Coast team and fought Brent Cooper in the sixth First Round fight. He won in his characteristic aggressive style. However, he was meant to fight Jimmy Lange, and an argument ensued over his choosing not to do so - Ishe Smith in particular become infuriated at his conduct. Tarick Salmaci was the only boxer to accept that he had fought well. After running into an uppercut from Jesse Brinkley in the quarter finals despite having had the upper hand with his characteristically aggressive boxing style was knocked into a daze, and found himself flat on the canvas. His feud with Ishe continued as they fought in a Fans Favourite Fight on finals night - trying an illegal move on him before going on to lose. Bonsante fought a rematch with Jesse Brinkley on The Contender Rematch Reality Show. Though the ringside announcers gave the fight to Bonsante, the judges awarded the victory to Brinkley. After \\"The Contender\\" In July 2006, he was beaten by super middleweight prospect Allan Green on ESPN. He injected new life in his career on January 12, 2007, with a ten-round unanimous decision win over archrival Matt Vanda for the Minnesota state middleweight title and vacant IBA Americas belt, before a big crowd of 8,872 at the Target Center in Minneapolis. Bonsante dropped Vanda in the tenth on the way to a 98‚Äì92, 98‚Äì91, 98‚Äì91 win. He lost a technical decision to John Duddy on March 16 at Madison Square Garden, after referee Steve Smoger judged him unable to continue after the ninth round due to a cut from an earlier accidental headbutt. On July 31, 2008, Bonsante lost a controversial 1st-round KO to Adonis Stevenson when Bonsante was caught with a sharp left just 46 seconds into the first round. Bonsante went down on his back, with his eyes shut. Veteran and WBC appointed referee (Gerry Bolen) began counting but stopped at a count of six as it appeared that Bonsante had been knocked out. As Bolen was waiving off the fight, Bonsante rapidly got up and appeared to be completely alert. Nonetheless, the referee refused to allow the fight to continue. ESPN boxing analyst Teddy Atlas commented that Bonsante may have been playing possum by pretending to be knocked out, but miscalculated the referee's reaction. On January 20, 2009, it was announced that Bonsante would defend his Minnesota middleweight title against challenger Andy Kolle at Grand Casino Hinckley on March 27 of the same year. Andy Kolle wins by a TKO in round 3 after which Anthony Bonsante announces retirement from the sport.http://www.startribune.com/sports/42167582.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUsI NotesExternal links * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:People from Crosby, Minnesota Category:American boxers of Italian descent Category:Boxers from Minnesota Category:The Contender (TV series) participants Category:American male boxers Category:People from Shakopee, Minnesota Category:Middleweight boxers ","title":"Anthony Bonsante"},{"id":"1863811","text":"Jeffrey Scott Holland, (born May 13, 1966), is an artist, writer and musician living both in New York City and in Louisville, Kentucky.

The village, located within Babergh district, has many cottages and timber-framed houses and all surround a recreation field. Possibly once the site of a monastery, the population of the civil parish at the 2001 census was 703, falling to 682 at the Census 2011. History The village is first recorded in 946 in the will of √Ülfgar, an Earl, where he endowed land to a community in the village, possibly a monastery. St Mary's Church The church was rebuilt in the 15th century and renovated in 1865, and appears several times in John Constable's paintings, though not always in the right place. The most notable feature is the red-brick tower; completed about 1470 and surmounted by stone spires, the buttresses are laced with canopied image niches. On the north side there is a Tudor porch, but the south porch, the main entrance, was entirely refaced by the Victorians. However, the windows and corbels reveal it to be one of the earliest parts of the church, an early 14th-century addition of two storeys to the building that was then replaced in the late 15th century. Listed buildings Stoke-by-Nayland's many listed buildings consist mainly of Grade II houses and cottages, mostly timber-framed and rendered with plain-tile roofs, although some are thatched or slated. Thorington Hall, in a separate hamlet to the south-east of the village, is a 17th-century timber-framed and plastered house with much original detail. There are cross wings at the north-east and south-west ends, and a staircase wing rises to above eaves level on the south-east front. The north-east wing has a jettied gable on both fronts, carved bressummer and bargeboards. The south-west wing has an oriel window on the upper storey on the north-west side, on four shaped brackets. It also includes a jettied gable with carved bressummer and bargeboards. The windows are mostly mullioned and transomed casements with leaded lights, some with the original 17th-century fastenings. There are some original windows, blocked. On the south-east front includes a modern glazed door with an 18th-century door-case and a scroll pediment on brackets. There are two heavy chimney stacks, one finely done with 6 grouped octagonal shafts. Downs Farmhouse, no longer used as such, dates from the early 16th century, with later extensions. It is timber-framed and rendered; with rear extensions partly faced in 19th-century red brick. Of two storeys and on a 3-cell plan, its roofs are plain-tiled with the original chimney-stack set externally on the rear wall of the hall, and a cross entry. The stack has been rebuilt in plain red brick. Street House is in Church Street and has a plain-tile roof above timber-framed construction behind a render finish. The Maltings, backing onto the churchyard, and the Old Guildhall, facing it across the road, each has exposed timber-framing and jettied fronts designed to be seen. Both these buildings are of four bays divided into tenements. Historical writings The village features in the 1868 National Gazetteer of Great Britain, volume 10, as: In 1870‚Äì72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described the village as: In 1887, John Bartholomew also wrote an entry on Stoke Nayland in the Gazetteer of the British Isles with a much shorter description: Amenities Stoke-by-Nayland contains two schools, one primary, Stoke by Nayland Church of England Primary School, and one independent school, Focus School. The village hall was established in 1911 as the Stoke by Nayland Institute. Now a registered charity the hall is now a general meeting place and hosts variety of events. Stoke By Nayland Hotel Golf and Spa is home to a golf course with two 18 hole courses. The club hosts two international PGA Tour events; the Senior Tour since 2006 and the EuroPro Tour since 2004.

Haifa: German Colony and harbour The Bay of Haifa or Haifa Bay (, Mifratz Heifa), formerly Bay of Acre,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica,  øAkko is a bay along the Mediterranean coast of Northern Israel. Haifa Bay is Israel's only natural harbor on the Mediterranean. Fed by the Kishon River, the cities of Haifa and Acre mark its southern and northern capes, while its centre is lined with dunes and the suburban Krayot neighbourhoods. Mount Carmel rises from the southern edge, while the mountains of the Western Galilee run up to the shore at the northern boundary. The Port of Haifa lies along part of its southeastern coastline. Haifa Bay also signifies one of Haifa's nine boroughs, covering the overwhelmingly industrial area northeast of Downtown and south of Kiryat Hayim. History In the 1920s, several kibbutzim were established in the Bat Galim neighborhood on Haifa Bay in the wake of British Mandatory budgeting for development of the area.Haifa Bay in the 1920s With the coast of Palestine lacking a modern harbor, the British authorities drew up plans for new port facilities. The Haifa Bay Development Company, founded in February 1925 to further these plans, could not recruit the necessary capital, so the transaction was made by the Palestine Land Development Company. The land was purchased from the Sursock family, which had bought it from the Ottoman government in 1872. The 45,000 dunam tract was known as the Jidro lands. The company also acquired a 99-year concession for an additional 12,000 dunams of adjoining land, bringing the total area to 57,000.From New Zion to Old Zion: American Jewish Immigration and Settlement in Palestine, 1917‚Äì1939 The land changed hands several times due to financial difficulties, eventually becoming the property of the Bayside Land Company, established in cooperation with the Jewish National Fund. In 1928, the company commissioned Patrick Abercrombie to draw up a development plan.From New Zion to Old Zion: American Jewish Immigration and Settlement in Palestine, 1917‚Äì1939 In 1934, the Phoenicia glass factory was established in Haifa Bay. The company moved to Yeruham in 1968, and is still operating today.Phoenicia Glass Works Ports and industrial zone The cooling towers of the Haifa oil refinery are a nationally recognized symbol of Haifa as a center of industry. The Port of Haifa and a private port operated by Israel Shipyards are located in Haifa Bay. In 2017 they handled a combined total of 32 million tons of cargo, making the port complex one of the largest in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Bay region is also home to an extensive industrial zone containing various factories, workshops, large shore-based oil refineries, chemical, metals fabrication and power plants and other industrial and storage facilities. The 76-meter high twin cooling towers of the Haifa oil refinery are a nationally recognized icon for the city. For this reason, they have been left intact, though they are no longer actually used since technological advancements in refining have made them obsolete. Environmental concerns Historically the concentration of industry in the area has also led to pollution of the air, bay and a higher incidence of cancer in the surrounding communities.Haifa's air quality In response, since the late 2000s decade the Israeli Environment Protection ministry, in conjunction with area industries, have implemented a comprehensive pollution reduction, monitoring and reporting programme for the region. This effort, together with major plants in the region switching from using heavy fuels to natural gas as their primary fuel source starting in 2013 has led to a significant reduction in air pollution. The ministry estimates that between 2009 and 2014 overall air pollution in the Bay area has been reduced by 70%, though the overall concentration of heavy industry in the area means that air pollution is still higher as compared to other regions in Israel.

Throughout Scandinavia, there are many remaining tumuli in honour of Viking kings and chieftains, in addition to runestones and other memorials. Some of the most notable of them are at the Borre mound cemetery, in Norway, at Birka in Sweden and Lindholm H√∏je, and Jelling in Denmark. A prominent tradition is that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a boat, or a stone ship, and given grave offerings in accordance with his earthly status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top of the remains in order to create a tumulus. Additional practices included sacrifice or cremation, but the most common was to bury the departed with goods that denoted their social status. Grave goods Grave goods from a v√∂lva's grave in K√∂pingsvik, √ñland, Sweden. There is an wand of iron with bronze details and a unique model of a house on the top. The finds are on display in the Swedish History Museum, Stockholm. It was common to leave gifts with the deceased. Both men and women received grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount and the value of the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally. The usual grave for a thrall was probably not much more than a hole in the ground. He was probably buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century. These grave goods not only symbolized status, but also represented key moments or successes within the individuals life. Specific quantities of weapons like arrows could signify the extent of one's military prowess.Andr√©n, Anders. \\"Behind 'Heathendom': Archaeological Studies of Old Norse Religion.\\" Scottish Archaeological Journal, 27, no. 2 (2005): 110. . The scope of grave goods varied throughout the viking diaspora, signifying the adaptability of viking funeral practices as they were influenced by these new cultures. While some factors such as animal themed ornamentation amongst jewelry and relics remained universal throughout the viking diaspora, some objects varied on the account of differing cultural influences. A common example being the integration of Christian iconography in jewelry, specifically crosses.Armit, Ian. \\"The Vikings.\\" In The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles, 195. Edinburgh University Press, 1996. Funerary monuments The deceased could be incinerated inside a stone ship. The picture shows two of the stone ships at Badelunda, near V√§ster√•s, Sweden. A Viking funeral could be a considerable expense, but the barrow and the grave goods were not considered to have been wasted. In addition to being a homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships. Jelling, in Denmark, is the largest royal memorial from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself. It was only one of the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, the church and the two Jelling stones testify to how important it was to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times. On three locations in Scandinavia, there are large grave fields that were used by an entire community: Birka in M√§laren, Hedeby at Schleswig and Lindholm H√∏je at √Ölborg. The graves at Lindholm H√∏je show a large variation in both shape and size. There are stone ships and there is a mix of graves that are triangular, quadrangular and circular. Such grave fields have been used during many generations and belong to village like settlements. Rituals The ritualistic practices of the viking diaspora were incredibly pliable as they adapted in response to temporal, cultural, and religious influences. While traces of pagan funeral practices remained a common thread, many of these practices shifted over time throughout these various regions, especially once Christianity began to rapidly influence the viking population.Paterson, Caroline. \\"A Tale of Two Cemeteries: Viking Burials at Cumwhitton and Carlisle, Cumbria.\\" In Crossing Boundaries: Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Art, Material Culture, Language and Literature of the Early Medieval World, edited by Cambridge Eric and Hawkes, Jane. Oxford; Philadelphia: Oxbow Books, 2017. . Recent discoveries at a burial site in Carlisle in the United Kingdom demonstrates a hybrid burial between pagan and Christian traditions, demonstrating the shift in ritual practice as the vikings began to slowly assimilate to these new regions. Death has always been a critical moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, people use rites. The ceremonies are transitional rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation at the same time as they provide strength for the bereaved to carry on with their lives. Despite the warlike customs of the Vikings, there was an element of fear surrounding death and what belonged to it. Norse folklore includes spirits of the dead and undead creatures such as revenants and draugr. A supposed sighting of the deceased as one of these creatures was frightful and ominous, usually interpreted as a sign that additional family members would die. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living. Other rituals involved the preparation of the corpse. Snorri Sturluson in the Prose Edda references a funeral rite involving the cutting of fingernails. lest unpared nails from the dead be available for the completion of the construction of Naglfar, the ship used to transport the army of j√∂tunn at Ragnar√∂k.. Some rituals demonstrated heavy theatrics, glorifying the sacrifices as actors in the greater narrative of the funeral. The funeral ritual could be drawn out for days, in order to accommodate the time needed to complete the grave. These practices could include prolonged episodes of feasting and drinking, music, songs and chants, visionary experiences, consensual sexual acts between couples and in groups, gang rape, suicide, human sacrifice and the mass killing of dozens of animals. Eyewitness accounts even credit women as having key roles in these ritualistic practices, serving as almost the director of the funeral. These performance styled funeral rituals tended to occur within similar places in order to create a spatial association of ritualistic practice to the land for the community. Places like lakes, clearings, or even around large trees could serve as the central location of these rituals. Ultimately, funeral practices were not just a singular act of burying one person. The scope of these practices tended to exceed the burying of just one individual. Ship burials The ship burial is a viking funeral practice traditionally reserved for individuals of high honor. The practice includes the burying of the individual within a ship, using the ship to contain the departed and their grave goods. These grave goods featured decorative ornamentation that far exceeded the extravagance of traditional burials. Additionally, animal remains such as oxen or horses tended to be buried within the ship.Sj√∏vold, Thorleif. \\"A Royal Viking Burial.\\" Archaeology, 11, no. 3 (1958): 191‚Äì2. . The ships tended to be ships of pleasure rather than ships utilized for travel or attack. Some ships were potentially chartered for the sake of a ship burial, especially considered they were designed without some necessary features like seats. Ibn Fadlan's account The tenth-century Arab Muslim writer Ahmad ibn Fadlan produced a description of a funeral near the Volga River of a chieftain whom he identified as belonging to people he called R≈´siyyah. Scholars have generally interpreted these people as Scandinavian Rus' on the Volga trade route from the Baltic to the Black Seas, though other theories have been suggested: Anders Winroth has commented that 'the exact identity of the Rus is much debated, and we should be careful not simply to take ibn Fadlan's account of the Rus as in any way representative of Viking Age Scandinavian customs'.Anders Winroth, The Age of the Vikings (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014), pp. 94‚Äì95. * There is a consensus that some elements of the funeral correspond to features of funerals distinctive to the Norse diaspora, particularly that it is a ship burial. * Some features are not paralleled in Scandinavia at all, such as the use of basil, which is unlikely to have been available in Scandinavia. * Some features are paralleled in Scandinavia, but are also paralleled more widely among the Turkic-speaking peoples among whom the events described by Ibn FadlƒÅn took place, so they do not necessarily reflect Scandinavian culture. Thus Ibn FadlƒÅn's account is reminiscent of a detail in the Icelandic short story V√∂lsa √æ√°ttr, where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her try to recover a sacred horse penis that has been thrown to her dog,. but other parallels exist among Turkic peoples.Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, \\"New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources\\", Viking and Medieval Scandinavia, 10 (2014), 65‚Äì97 (pp. 86‚Äì87). Thus some recent scholarship has sought to maximise the case that Ibn FadlƒÅn informs us about practice in tenth-century Scandinavia,.Neil Price, \\"Passing into Poetry: Viking-Age Mortuary Drama and the Origins of Norse Mythology\\", Medieval Archaeology, 54:1 (2010), 123‚Äì156 (pp. 132‚Äì33), . while other work has tended to minimise it.Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, \\"New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources\\", Viking and Medieval Scandinavia, 10 (2014), 65‚Äì97 (pp. 80‚Äì91).James E. Montgomery, \\"Vikings and Rus in Arabic Source\\", in Living Islamic History, ed. by Yasir Suleiman (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), pp. 151‚Äì65 (pp. 157‚Äì61). =Summary= Ibn FadlƒÅn says that if a poor man dies, his fellows build a small boat into which they put the body, before setting it on fire. He then gives a detailed account of the burial he witnessed of a great man. In such a case, Ibn FadlƒÅn says that a third of his wealth is inherited by his family, a third pays for the funeral clothes, and a third pays for nabƒ´dh (an alcoholic drink) to be drunk at the cremation. The dead chieftain was put in a temporary grave with nƒÅbidh, fruit, and a drum, which was covered for ten days until they had sewn new clothes for him. Ibn FadlƒÅn says that the dead man's family ask his slave girls and young slave boys for a volunteer to die with him; \\"usually, it is the slave girls who offer to die\\". A woman volunteered and was continually accompanied by two slave girls, daughters of the Angel of Death, being given a great amount of intoxicating drinks while she sang happily. When the time had arrived for cremation, they pulled his boat ashore from the river and put it on a platform of wood. They made a richly furnished bed for the dead chieftain on the ship. Thereafter, an old woman referred to as the \\"Angel of Death\\" put cushions on the bed. Then they disinterred the chieftain and dressed him in the new clothes. The chieftain was sat on his bed with nƒÅbidh, fruit, basil, bread, meat, and onions about him. Then they cut a dog in two and threw the halves into the boat, and placed the man's weapons beside him. They had two horses run themselves sweaty, cut them to pieces, and threw the meat into the ship. Finally, they killed two cows, a hen and a cock, and did the same with them. Meanwhile, the slave girl went from one tent to the other and had sexual intercourse with the master of each. Every man told her: \\"Tell your master that I have done this purely out of love for you.\\" In the afternoon, they moved the slave girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her deceased relatives, and the third time she saw her master in Paradise. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young people. She saw that her master beckoned for her. Then she was brought a chicken which she decapitated, and which was then thrown on the boat. Thereafter, the slave girl was taken away to the ship. She removed her bracelets and gave them to the old woman. Thereafter she removed her anklets and gave them to the old woman's two daughters. Then they took her aboard the ship, but they did not allow her to enter the tent where the dead chieftain lay. The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang, before the old woman urged her to enter the tent. \\"I saw that the girl did not know what she was doing\\", notes Ibn FadlƒÅn. Then the girl was pulled into the tent by the old woman and the men started to beat on their shields with sticks so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have intercourse with the girl, after which they laid her onto her master's bed beside him. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death looped a rope around her neck and while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the closest male relative of the dead chieftain walked backwards, naked, covering his anus with one hand and a piece of burning wood with the other, and set the ship aflame, after which other people added wood to the fire. An informant explained to Ibn FadlƒÅn that the fire expedites the dead man's arrival in Paradise, by contrast with Islamic practices of inhumation. Afterwards, a round barrow was built over the ashes, and in the centre of the mound they erected a post of birch wood, where they carved the names of the dead chieftain and his king. Then they departed. =Interpretation= The sexual rites with the slave girl have been imagined to symbolize her role as a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain. While the scholarly consensus assumes that the slave girl would have felt happy and privileged about having sex with many people before being killed, recent work has suggested that we should instead see this as an account of rape and \\"brutal strangulation\\".Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, \\"New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources\\", Viking and Medieval Scandinavia, 10 (2014), 65‚Äì97 (pp. 83‚Äì84). It has been suggested that, by using intoxicating drinks, the mourners thought to put the slave girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic, and that through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. Human sacrifice Sketch of the executioner during a pagan Norse sacrifice by Carl Larsson, for Midvinterblot Thralls could be sacrificed during a funeral so they could serve their master in the next world.. Sigur√∞arkvi√∞a hin skamma contains several stanzas in which the Valkyrie Brynhildr gives instructions for the number of slaves to be sacrificed for the funeral of the hero Sigurd, and how their bodies were to be arranged on the pyre, as in the following stanza: Occasionally in the Viking Age, a widow was sacrificed at her husband's funeral. Cremation It was common to burn the corpse and the grave offerings on a pyre. Only some incinerated fragments of metal and of animal and human bones would remain. The pyre was constructed to make the pillar of smoke as massive as possible, in order to elevate the deceased to the afterlife.. The symbolism is described in the Ynglinga saga: A drinking scene on an image stone from Gotland, Sweden, in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. Funeral ale and the passing of inheritance On the seventh day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it involved a ritual drinking). The funeral ale was a way of socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority. Several of the large runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersj√∂ stone, which explains how a lady came to inherit the property of not only her children but also her grandchildren. and the H√∂gby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir after the death of all her uncles.. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from √òstfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.

LRC was designed to run with locomotives, or power cars, at both ends and provide service on non-upgraded railway routes. To accomplish this, the LRC passenger cars feature active-tilt technology to reduce the forces on the passengers when a train travels at high speeds through curves. LRCs have reached speeds as high as on test runs. On its only regular service route, on the Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor, wear concerns, signalling issues and conflicts with slower-moving freight trains limit this to or less. For service at these speeds, a single power car was used. Special signage allowed the LRC to run at higher speeds than normal traffic across a great portion of the Corridor when the tilt system was enabled. The LRC locomotives and passenger cars are compatible with conventional equipment. While the last LRC locomotive was removed from service on 12 December 2001, the passenger cars are still in widespread use and form the backbone of Via Rail's services, albeit with the tilt system disabled. The same basic car forms the basis of the Acela in the U.S. History=Problems with speed As a vehicle turns it generates centrifugal force, which is proportional to the square of the speed and inversely proportional to the radius. Even a small amount of force, acting across the length of the human body, creates a moment that can make moving about difficult. Centrifugal forces are not normally an issue in an automobile because the occupants are seated, nor in an aircraft where the fuselage is tilted so the centrifugal force passes through the line of the floor. It is primarily a problem in high-speed trains, where passengers and attendants often walk about while the train is moving. The force also pushes the entire train sideways, leading to wear of the outer rail. This was not an issue on early railways where the speed was low, but gained importance as line speeds increased and the radius of curvature became tighter. One solution is to place speed restrictions on curved sections of track; another is to bank the railbed on the curve, with the outer rail higher than the inner rail so the net force passes straight through the floor of the coach. Banking the track is known as \\"cant\\" or superelevation. These measures were gradually adopted on the railways between 1835 and 1860. The use of track cant can only be applied where the speed of the train is fixed in advance. Slower, or stationary, traffic sharing the same line will experience forces pulling inwards, and, conversely, faster traffic will still experience forces pulling outwards. Long experience has shown that, to avoid discomfort on slower trains, track cant should not exceed 6¬∞; and, for trains moving more quickly, cant deficiency should not exceed 4.5¬∞. Dedicated high-speed railway lines were being constructed in Japan in the 1960s. Japan had previously used a but decided to lay entirely new standard gauge lines for these services, the Shinkansen. The lines were designed for a running speed of , using gentle curves with a minimum radii of , and entirely new signalling systems able to provide enough warning to stop a train at within . The Europeans were planning similar systems in several countries, while the UK, and Canada, could not justify such an expense given their passenger numbers. Active tilt Another solution to this problem had been developed in the 1950s but not widely used: tilting trains. Tilting trains rock into the curve to tilt the passenger cars the same way that a superelevated track would tilt them inward. Tilting systems had been introduced in service by the Spanish Talgo, but this system was \\"passive\\" and took some time to respond to curves. Great improvement can be made by making the system \\"active\\", reading the forces on the cars with sensors and quickly rotating them to the proper angle using hydraulic rams. British Rail ran an extensive experimental program on active tilt systems in the 1960s that was highly influential, and followed these studies in the 1970s with a new tilting train design, the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). The technical design objectives for the APT included a maximum speed 50% higher than existing trains, curving speeds 40% higher, all while running on existing tracks within the limits of existing signals. While tilting reduces the problem for the passengers, it does not change the forces on the rails. A train going around a bend at high speed rides up onto the rails, and if the flanges on the inside of the wheels contact the rails they cause considerable wear. Eliminating this effect is difficult, but it can be reduced by lowering the weight of the locomotive, or eliminating the locomotive and distributing the motive power throughout the train. APT took the former route, and the original APT-E used gas turbine power. Gas turbines have an excellent power-to-weight ratio, perhaps ten times that of a conventional diesel engine, with the downside that they use considerably more fuel at idle. This was not a concern when the APT was first being designed, but after the 1973 oil crisis they quickly changed the design to be electrically powered. This was even lighter than the turbine version, but requiring the lines to be electrified at great cost. As a result, only the West Coast Main Line from London to Glasgow used the electrically powered APT- Ps.First tilting train arrives early BBC News 5 January 2004 =Turbo= CN Turbo in Toronto in 1975. The only route with passenger numbers and trip times suitable for high-speed service in Canada at the time was the Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor, especially the portion between Toronto and Montreal that accounts for two-thirds of the passengers in the Corridor.Peter Warwick, \\"Via's bold Corridor plan\\", Trains, December 2009 The TurboTrain, or simply \\"Turbo\\" as CN preferred, was CN's first attempt to provide higher speeds along the Corridor. Designed in the early 1960s by Sikorsky Aircraft, the TurboTrain used a licensed version of Talgo's passive tilt system and a new turbine- powered locomotive. The CN trainsets were built in Canada by a consortium of Dofasco for the bogies and suspension system, Alcan for the car bodies, and Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) for the engines and power systems. All three companies gained valuable experience with modern passenger train design as a result of the project. The Turbo was far from perfect, however. Its articulated bogies meant that the train could only be uncoupled in the maintenance yards. If there was a problem with a single car the entire train had to be taken out of service, and the inability to easily change train length significantly reduced its flexibility. The design featured unique doors at either end to allow two trains to be coupled into one longer one, but in practice this proved too much trouble to be worth it. Moreover, while the turbine power was lightweight and proved very reliable, it was also very inefficient in fuel terms. =LRC= A competitor to the Turbo had been brewing for some time at this point. As early as 1966 an engineer in Alcan had been formulating ideas for a new lightweight train and introduced the design to CN. The car body design was made mostly of aluminum for light weight, and built two inches lower than conventional sets to cut down wind resistance. The entire underside and running gear were also streamlined and tight-fitting from car to car to reduce the inter-car gap and the drag that causes. Active tilt in the cars would allow them to take advantage of higher speeds on existing lines, and an advanced suspension design would offer a smooth ride at all speeds. The locomotive was based on the ALCO 16-251F prime mover rated at at 1050 rpm.\\"LRC Locomotive - 1\\", Via Rail for-sale page This was the only suitable engine already being built at MLW; it was a relatively old design from the 1950s, and the LRC would prove to be one of its last uses in North America. To keep the train as a whole as streamlined as possible, the loco body was wrapped very tightly around the engine, at the same height as the cars. The resulting design was quite small even by modern standards, several feet shorter than the GE Genesis that replaced them in Via service, and thousands of pounds lighter. The light weight and low wind resistance would allow higher speeds while using less power, improving fuel efficiency. Despite the older engine design, the LRC was a great advance in the state of the art over the Turbo in every way, offering a smoother ride at the same or faster speeds, with lower capital and operational costs, and the ability to easily change train lengths. In January 1967, the two companies approached Dofasco and MLW about the possibility of a new joint venture to develop the design. In December, the group presented their design to Transport Canada, and in January another presentation was made to the Department of International Trade and Commerce to gain funding. The Canadian government's Transportation Development Centre (TDC) outside of Montreal agreed to provide development funding for the technology under the Program for the Advancement of Industrial Technology (PAIT). The effort found strong support within the government. The Canadian Transport Commission studied the problem of offering Corridor service and concluded that \\"the most profitable strategy to adopt involves maximizing the potential of existing railway facilities through the introduction of new vehicle technology.\\"\\"Via's LRC Fleet\\", Via Rail =Designing the suspension= The first consideration was whether or not a suitable tilting mechanism could be built into the bogies that would not require extra space or project into the car. Dofasco, a major steel manufacturer in Hamilton, won the majority of the bogie development contracts. They developed a system that consisted of two parts, a bogie and suspension on the bottom, and a separate tilting mechanism on top. The suspension consisted of several parts. Between the axle and the bogie frame was a series of C-shaped steel leaf springs stacked inside each other for the basic suspension, with rubber sheets between the leaves providing some shock absorption. A second set of softer springs on top of the bogie provided finer ride quality. Four sets of shock absorbers completed the suspension. The tilt controls were developed by SPAR Aerospace and Sperry Rand Canada. The car body rode on rollers fitted into two U-shaped arms at the front and back of each bogie. Hydraulic rams moved the car from side to side along these arms, tilting it up to 8.5 degrees.See diagram, , or image, This made the bottom of the coach slide sideways while it rotated, so that the axis of motion was in the middle of the car body, instead of the top (like the Turbo) or bottom (like most tilt systems). This reduced the feeling of motion on the passengers by keeping the rotation close to their center of gravity, and reduced loads to 0.5 g. Each bogie was equipped with an accelerometer and operated as a completely self-contained unit. Prototypes and testing 1977 Amtrak LRC Rendering With Dofasco's successful demonstration of a tilting system, additional contracts were offered to build a prototype train. The name LRC was carefully selected to define the project's goals bilingually: a lightweight train, operating at high speeds, and providing a more comfortable ride than existing trains. Alcan of Montreal won the contract for the aluminum passenger cars and the carbody of the locomotive, while MLW developed the new diesel-electric system. The companies had predicted that the development of the prototype would cost $2.48 million, and the government provided half of that under the PAIT agreements. The project overran the budget by $77,000, which the companies supplied out-of- pocket. The prototype coach was completed in 1971 and started testing with conventional locomotives. By the summer of 1972, it had seen of service, and a few relatively minor problems cropped up. Issues with the tilting mechanism were studied by a group at SPAR and McMaster University, and several fixes incorporated into the design. By that point the prototype locomotive was 85% complete. During this period, CN executives started expressing concerns about the cost of the equipment, while their engineers stated a preference for electrically powered tilting in place of the hydraulic system. Dofasco stated that such a change would be impractical, upsetting CN. In response, CN requested a series of additional tests, delaying their decision on ordering the design. This was also likely a response to the problems encountered on the Turbo, which had been rushed into service for Expo '67 before rigorous testing had worked out its problems. With the PAIT funds exhausted in 1972 and the launch customer delaying its orders, the project went into a lengthy hiatus period where little progress was made. To continue testing without an order from CN, the consortium was forced to turn to the TDC for additional funds. It was not until July 1973 that an additional $460,000 was released to finish the locomotive and start testing. A four-phase program was envisioned to bring the LRC to production. The first two phases would have the coach running on normal mainline service through April 1973 as part of Phase 1 and runs at higher speeds in Phase 2 through to July 1974. Testing was further delayed due to a railway strike in Canada, which led the consortium to explore moving the high- speed tests to the U.S.'s High Speed Ground Test Center in Pueblo, Colorado. Although a deal was arranged in January 1974, testing continued in Canada. Later that year the consortium learned that the U.S. was considering foreign designs for service with Amtrak, so the contract was revived and the LRC prototype was sent for a six-week period starting in November 1974. The tracks it ran on included butted and welded rail, concrete and wooden ties, and was originally designed to test low-speed urban transport designs at speeds up to . During the testing the train covered at speeds of up to , and routinely took corners designed for at . In one all-day test it averaged including three 10‚Äëminute stops to change crews. The testing was considered a great success by everyone involved, although Amtrak eventually purchased locally made versions of the Turboliner. With Phase 1 and 2 complete, additional funding was provided in 1975 to complete the last two phases. Phase 3 started with the LRC entering service on the Toronto-Sarnia portion of the Corridor, replacing the existing Tempos, running on the Tempo's existing schedules and lower speeds. The locomotive ran for another in these tests, and the coach . Simultaneously the last phase, Phase 4, had to demonstrate high speeds on Canadian rails, not test sites. On 12 March 1976 on a stretch of CN line outside Farnham, Quebec, the prototype reached . With those tests successfully completed, the LRC had passed the entire four-phase testing program and was cleared for Canadian service. The total cost for testing, including the funds released in 1973 and 1975, reached $1.1 million. The program as a whole hit $5 million in total. Into production Bombardier purchased MLW in 1975, in part to gain access to the LRC. By this point, it had outstripped the development of the APT in the UK and would enter service before it. Although it had a lower top speed than the APT or Japanese designs, it was otherwise considered very advanced. Fuel economy was particularity noteworthy; the LRC used slightly more than with a five-car train, whereas existing fleets used just under , and the Turbo used . The monocoque aluminum coaches were also noteworthy; they weighed empty, about one-third less than CN's existing fleet, and were somewhat lighter than the Amfleet coaches being introduced at the same time in the U.S. They were built around two aluminum girders running the length of the car, providing them with the high strength needed to meet the more stringent North American crash standards, while still being competitive with similar designs from Europe. They also included heavy soundproofing, including of foam insulation throughout the body. The only major problem with the LRC to come up during development was a continued weight increase of the locomotives. The prototype locomotive weighted , about less than a conventional low-speed loco. However, while development turned into production the weight grew to , eliminating any difference. By 1980, the National Research Council published a report noting that the weight had grown so much that service above would cause unacceptable wear on the Corridor, thereby limiting the new LRC to the same speeds of the Turbo it was meant to replace. Alcan and TDC were also highly critical of Bombardier's management of the MLW portion of the program, suggesting that their mid-level management lacked the know-how to conclude the project rapidly. Service entry While work progressed on the LRC, the Canadian government was in the initial stages of fulfilling an election promise made by Pierre Trudeau in 1974 to implement a nationwide carrier similar to Amtrak in the U.S.Monte Stewart, \\"Via Rail boss keeps business on the move\\", Business Edge, Volume 7 Number 12 (15 June 2007)Monte Paulsen, \\"Off the Rails\\", The Walrus, June 2009 Although they agreed in principle to buy the LRC in 1975, purchase of the LRC was put on hold while the newly forming Via Rail was set up. CN, which had been wanting to rid itself of passenger service since the late 1960s, started passing off its existing passenger rolling stock to Via starting in 1976. Amtrak locomotive 38, pulling the \\"Beacon Hill\\" service between New Haven and Boston, as seen in December 1980. In the meantime, in January 1977 Amtrak signed a $10 million lease agreement for two locomotives with five coaches each, with an option to buy the trains at any time, or return them after the two years were up. Amtrak was in the process of investigating high-speed service on their own Northeast Corridor, especially between New York City and Boston. This portion of the line contained numerous curves, and they were investigating active tilt for at least this portion of the route. The \\"LRC 1\\" batch for Amtrak was completed in the fall of 1980. They ran in revenue service as Amtrak #38 and #39 (locomotives) and #40 to 49 (cars), where they were used on the Beacon Hill (New Haven-Boston) and Shoreliner (New York-Boston) services. Amtrak declined to take over the trains and they were returned to Bombardier in 1982. There were significant differences between these machines and the later Canadian sets, so they could not be easily mixed. Via used the Amtrak coaches for their International service to Chicago, repainted in Via Rail colours, and renumbered 3501 to 3508, 3511 and 3512. The locos (#38 and #39) were returned to MLW before being scrapped in 1990; the ten coaches are currently parked at Via's headquarters in Montreal.They can be seen in this 2009 image of Via's yard in Montreal: they are the white-coloured cars on the right. Despite Amtrak not taking up the LRC design, there was some consideration, even at that early date, of an electric locomotive version of the same basic design. By 1978 Via was up and running and they formalized their first order for 10 LRC locomotives and 50 coachesNote that Via's history page puts this in January 1977, but all other references state it was in 1978. (numbered 3300 to 3349). The total price for the project to this point was $90 million, less than the APT project in the U.K., and less than the successful Metroliner project in the U.S. (after being adjusted for inflation). This order was then expanded for another 10 locomotives. This batch of 20 became the \\"LRC 2\\" (loco numbers 6900 to 6920). In 1981 they placed another order for 10 locomotives (6921 to 6930) and another 50 coaches (3350 to 3399), the \\"LRC 3\\" batch.Via's document and an examination of the serials both demonstrate there were 31 locos in Via service. The serial suggest the 31st was part of the first batch, but none of the references state this exactly. In service LRC#6905 at Ottawa, Ontario during the initial Nightstar test runs, in the summer of 2000. This was one of the last runs of the LRC locomotives. The first Canadian production set was delivered to Montreal's Windsor Station on 1 June 1981.\\"Via Rail an astounding history\\", Via The first fare-paying run was made from Toronto to Sarnia on 4 September 1981, on Labor Day weekend. Initially, the LRCs were plagued with problems. One common problem was that the cars would \\"lock\\" in the tilted position even after the track had straightened out from a curve. At the time, Bombardier was estimating total sales of another 80 LRC sets, for up to $500 million. Their calculations showed that the LRC would have a cost per passenger of $23.26 over a trip, only slightly higher than conventional trains. Although the LRC used much less fuel per passenger than conventional sets, even less than a bus, no further sales were forthcoming. Via Rail put the trains into service, persisting through their initial teething pains and coming to depend on the LRC for the majority of its intercity service in the Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor. The original LRC locomotives were gradually retired after ten to fifteen years of service, although #6905 was used during test runs of the new \\"Renaissance\\" carriages between Glen Robertson and Ottawa in 2000. The last run of an LRC locomotive was in 2001. Retirement After being retired, some of the LRC locomotives were sold to Industrial Rail Services of Moncton, New Brunswick. Some were scrapped and others awaiting sale to museums or operators. Currently, only two known examples have survived into preservation. LRC carriages Most of the carriages remained in service after the withdrawal of the LRC locomotives, though pulled by newer locomotives, usually P42DCs and often with the tilting mechanism disabled. From 2003 onwards, Via installed wireless internet on all Corridor trains, with distinctive white domes for the satellite downlink being installed on top of the first class cars. A new capital program announced by the Canadian government in October 2007 includes funding for the refurbishment of Via's remaining LRC cars. The tilting mechanisms will be removed as part of this project.Rebecca Penty, \\"Bring on the Locomotion\\" , Telegraph-Journal, 2 May 2009 Windsor Legacy Bombardier have since used updated versions of the LRC carriages and their tilt systems in the Acela electric high-speed trains they developed for Amtrak in the late 1990s (consisting of 26 club cars and 72 passenger cars), the Super Voyager in the United Kingdom, and in the experimental JetTrain recently proposed for several corridors in Canada and the United States. Preservation In August 2010, The Toronto Railway Historical Association announced that it had successfully concluded the purchase of LRC locomotive #6917 from Via Rail Canada, as part of its \\"Save The LRC\\" campaign. This locomotive is destined to be placed in The Toronto Railway Heritage Centre museum in the former Canadian Pacific John St. Roundhouse in Toronto, once the necessary money has been raised for the move. LRC locomotive #6921 is preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum outside of Montreal. It ran under its own power in 2015.

Background  By the late 19th century, the U.S. had several interests in the western Pacific to defend; namely, access to the Chinese market, and its colonies ‚Äì the Philippines and Guam ‚Äì which the U.S. had gained as a result of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898). After Japan's victories in the Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95) and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, the U.S. began to regard Japan as a potential threat to its interests in the western Pacific. This antagonism was intensified by Japan's objections to an attempt to annex Hawaii to the U.S. (1893)On this occasion, Japan sent the cruiser. The cruiser was a very tactical ship used to attck the U.S in attle. island-hopping helped the US defeat Japan. to Honolulu, Hawaii; the Naniwa arrived at Hawaii on February 23, 1894. See: William L. Neumann, \\"The First Abrasions\\" in: Ellis S. Krauss and Benjamin Nyblade, ed.s, Japan and North America: First contacts to the Pacific War, Volume 1, (London, England: RouteledgeCurzon, 2004), page 114. and by Japan's objections to discrimination against Japanese immigrants both in Hawaii (1897) ‚Äì on this occasion, Japan sent the cruiser Naniwa to Honolulu, HawaiiSee: * \\"Japan's Points: Hawaiian government to be asked questions.\\" (May 4, 1897) Hawaiian Gazette, vol. 32, no 36, page 1. * \\"No Arbitration: Minister Shimamura on indemnity claim.\\" (May 7, 1897), Hawaiian Gazette, vol. 32, no. 37, page 1. ‚Äì and in California (1906, 1913). As a result, the U.S. Navy began to draft, as early as 1897, war plans against Japan, which were eventually code-named \\"War Plan Orange\\". The war plan of 1911, which was drafted under Rear Admiral Raymond P. Rodgers, included an island-hopping strategy for approaching Japan. After World War I, the Versailles Treaty gave Japan a mandate over former German colonies in the western Pacific; specifically, the Mariana, Marshall, and the Caroline Islands. If these islands were fortified, Japan could, in principle, deny the U.S. access to its interests in the western Pacific. Therefore, in 1921, Major Earl Hancock Ellis of the U.S. Marine Corps drafted \\"Plan 712, Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia,\\" a plan for war against Japan which updated War Plan Orange by incorporating modern military technology (submarines, aircraft, etc.) and which again included an island-hopping strategy.See: * * Shortly afterward, a British reporter on naval affairs, Hector Charles Bywater, publicized the prospect of a Japanese-American war in his books Seapower in the Pacific (1921) and The Great Pacific War (1925), which detailed an island- hopping strategy. The books were read not only by Americans but by senior officers of the Japanese Imperial Navy, who used \\"island-hopping\\" in their successful southeast Asia offensives in 1941 and 1942.  Rationale and use  This strategy was possible in part because the Allies used submarine and air attacks to blockade and isolate Japanese bases, weakening their garrisons and reducing the Japanese ability to resupply and reinforce them. Thus troops on islands which had been bypassed, such as the major base at Rabaul, were useless to the Japanese war effort and left to \\"wither on the vine\\". General Douglas MacArthur greatly supported this strategy in his effort to regain the Philippines from Japanese occupation. This strategy began to be implemented in late 1943 in Operation Cartwheel. While MacArthur claimed to have invented the strategy, it initially came out of the Navy.  Advantages  Leapfrogging would allow the United States forces to reach Japan quickly and not expend the time, manpower, and supplies to capture every Japanese-held island on the way. It would give the Allies the advantage of surprise and keep the Japanese off balance. The overall leapfrogging strategy would involve two prongs. A force led by Admiral Chester Nimitz, with a smaller land force and larger fleet, would advance north towards the island and capture the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Marianas, going generally in the direction of the Bonin Islands. The southern prong, led by General MacArthur and with larger land forces, would take the Solomons, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, advancing toward the Philippines.  Exceptions  The principle of leapfrogging was not always followed in the Pacific. When MacArthur moved south to attack Mindanao after capturing the northern Philippines, and when he instigated the reconquest of portions of Borneo, he violated the \\"basic tenets\\" of island hopping. In the first case, this may have been motivated by MacArthur's promise to return to the people of the Philippines as soon as possible.

PSSA scores Pennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. ;Reading (11th graders on grade level) *2012 - 67% (19% below basic). State - 67%.

Though he was not awarded a Nobel Prize for his plays, as the first of these were awarded after he published his last play in 1899, playwright Henrik Ibsen is probably the most famous figure in Norwegian literature. Ibsen wrote plays such as Peer Gynt, A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, and The Lady from the Sea. Other famous Norwegian writers from the realistic era include Jonas Lie and Alexander Kielland, who are along with Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson and Henrik Ibsen regarded as the \\"four greats\\" of Norwegian literature. Also of importance to the Norwegian literary culture is the Norse literature, and in particular the works of Snorri Sturluson, as well as the more recent folk tales, collected by Peter Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Moe in the 19th century. Norwegian literature attained international acclaim in the 1990s with Jostein Gaarder's novel Sophie's World (Sofies verden), which was translated into 40 languages.

Many of them remain to this day and represent Norway's most important contribution to architectural history. A fine example is The Stave Church at Urnes which is now on UNESCO's World Heritage List. Another notable example of wooden architecture is Bryggen (the wharf) in Bergen, consisting of a row of narrow wooden structures along the quayside. Historical quarter of Bryggen in Bergen. In the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities such as Kongsberg with its Baroque church and R√∏ros with its wooden buildings were established. After Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. Architect Christian H. Grosch designed the oldest parts of the University of Oslo, the Oslo Stock Exchange, and many other buildings and churches. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city of √Ölesund was rebuilt in the Art Nouveau style. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture, but it is only in recent decades that Norwegian architects have truly achieved international renown.

For an extended period, the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen. It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with even more impressive landscapes. Johan Christian Dahl (1788‚Äì1857), originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of west Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.\\" Norway's new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as Kitty Kielland (1843‚Äì1914), an early female painter who studied under Gude: Harriet Backer (1845‚Äì1932), another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism. Frits Thaulow (1847‚Äì1906), an impressionist, was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was Christian Krohg (1852‚Äì1925), a realist painter, famous for his paintings of prostitutes.Norwegian Artists from ArtCyclopedia.

Photography  The oldest Norwegian photograph is from Hans Th√∏ger Winther dating back to 1840. Marcus Selmer is considered to be the first dedicated landscape photographer but Knud Knudsen and the Swede Axel Lindahl are remembered for their extensive travels aimed at capturing landscapes. From the late 19th century until World War I, photographers set up shop throughout Norway. A remarkably large number of women were among them. In 1901, Anders Beer Wilse returned from Seattle and established one of the most famous photographer careers in Norway. Although dominated primarily by German influences in the late 19th century, pictorialism caught on in Norway as it did elsewhere in the world and was promoted by the Oslo camera club, founded in 1921. The pictorialists include Robert Collett, Aage Remfeldt, Thomas Blehr, and Waldemar Eide. Around World War I, portrait photography in Norway became more of an expressive art as a result of the work of Waldemar Eide, Dimitri Koloboff, Gunnar Theodor Sj√∏wall, Aage Remfeldt, Hans Johnsrud and Anders Beer Wilse. In 1971, the first photographic work (by K√•re Kivij√§rvi) was accepted at the prestigious Autumn Exhibition in Oslo, marking the widespread acceptance of photography as an art form.Fotohistorie from Norsk museum for fotografi (Norwegian Museum for Photography ).

US General Joseph Dunford inspects members of the CG during a visit to Ottawa. The uniforms that the CG are wearing represent the different services of the Canadian Forces. The Ceremonial Guard (CG) () is an ad hoc military unit in the Canadian Armed Forces that performs the Changing the Guard ceremony on Parliament Hill and posts sentries at Rideau Hall, the residence of the Governor General of Canada, with the National War Memorial being sentried by the National Sentry Program (NSP), which is carried out by different regiments and other units in order of precedence throughout the summer until mid-November. The Ceremonial Guard used to draw principally from the two Primary Reserve (militia) regiments of Foot Guards: the Governor General's Foot Guards (GGFG) from Ottawa (of which the Ceremonial Guard is a sub-unit) and the Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) from Montreal, who assumed the duties of the The Canadian Guards upon their disbandment. However, since 2007 the Ceremonial Guard has been staffed with a pan‚ÄìCanadian Forces approach, drawing members from the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force. As with any guard unit in the Canadian Forces, uniforms originate from the Queen's Guard, and rank insignia worn on the uniforms generally follow the pattern currently in force. Members of the CG each carry an unloaded Colt Canada C7 rifle. Origins A guard of honour provided by the 1st Battalion, Canadian Guards, during the visit of West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard to Ottawa in 1964. The Ceremonial Guard originated from the Canadian Guards regiment, which served in ceremonial occasions for 20 years in the 1950s and 1960s. It conducted its first guard mount on Parliament Hill on 2 July 1959 in the presence of Elizabeth II. Beginning in the early 1970s, the CGG and the GGFG were added to the Public Duties Detachment (PDD) of the Canadian Guards, due to it being reduced to nil strength in 1970. The PDD, which had been based at CFB Rockcliffe until 1985, changed its name to the Ceremonial Guard in 1979, when the unit became mixed sex due to a compromise by the Department of National Defence as a result of a complaint to a human rights commission on the matter that women could not join the guard due to its status as an infantry unit.http://www.royalmontrealregiment.com/on-the-hill-rmr-soldiers- parade-with-ceremonial-guard/https://www.cbc.ca/archives/when-ottawa-was- forced-to-change-its-changing-of-the-guard- ceremony-1.5169623https://www.cbc.ca/archives/when-ottawa-was-forced-to- change-its-changing-of-the-guard-ceremony-1.5169623 Since its inception, it has served for over 60 seasons spanning 60 years. In 2020, for the first time since its inception, the summer program was cancelled by order of Commander of the Canadian Army, Lt-General Wayne Eyre, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/changing-of-the-guard-on-parliament-hill- cancelled-due-to-covid-19-1.4881936 Unit composition When the Guard joins together, it consists of the following: * Public Duties Company ** 1st Division **2nd Division **3rd Division **PD Division * Headquarters Company * Band of the Ceremonial GuardBAND OF THE CEREMONIAL GUARD CONCERT **Pipes and Drums **Military Band The total strength is about 350 people. The uniforms worn represent both infantry guards regiments of the Governor General's Foot Guards (GGFG) from Ottawa, and the Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) from Montreal. The Public Duties Company is further broken down into platoons and divisions. The Public Duties Company has 4 divisions. A division is about 20‚Äì26 soldiers. The CG can also form an ad hoc drill platoon from its ranks. The Ceremonial Guard maintains no regimental colour nor has it any battle honours of its own as it is not a permanent unit in the Canadian Forces' order of battle. The only colours flown in the ceremonies are those of the two guards regiments. The unit exists with a full composition only from the end of MayCeremonial Guard launches its 60th season to the end of August. During the rest of the year a small administrative corps remains to prepare for next year's public duties season, and beginning in early May the unit stands up partially to allow for the conduct of Basic Military Qualification and other military courses as required. The unit also plans and executes the Canadian Forces beating retreat \\"Fortissimo\\". This takes place each year in July in conjunction with month-long Canada Day celebrations. All members of the Ceremonial Guard are fully trained members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).Who forms the Canadian military's ceremonial guard?  Band  Band of the Ceremonial Guard The Ceremonial Guard also maintains its own military band and pipe band that form a separate company. The members of the Band of the Ceremonial Guard () are made up of musicians from the GGFG and the CGG. Musicians are drawn from military units and colleges or universities across Canada, and are auditioned months in advance. All new musicians must pass the Canadian Armed Forces Basic Military Qualification Course (BMQ) before they can be employed with the Ceremonial Guard. Public duties The primary and most visible function of the Ceremonial Guard is, as mentioned, the Changing of the Guard on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. The Changing of the Guard Ceremony is a parade representing the changing of the guards/sentries posted at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Canadian monarch when in Ottawa, and her representative, the governor general, in her absence. The tradition began on Canada Day in 1959 when the 1st Battalion, Canadian Guards, mounted the new guard on Parliament Hill with its band and corps of drums. The ceremony was so popular that the Ottawa Board of Trade asked for permission from the army to continue the ceremony the following year. A full company of two platoons is employed in daily public duties, with both divisions of one platoon parading as the 'new guard' ‚Äì those to take over duties at Rideau Hall ‚Äì and the other platoon of the company split, one division parading as 'old guard', and the other performing sentry duties at Rideau Hall and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for the day. Changing of the Guard Canadian Grenadiers marching during CG The parade begins at the Cartier Square Drill Hall with the drum major, followed by the band, and the two divisions of the 'new guard'. Turning north onto Queen Elizabeth Drive, the parade continues underneath the Laurier Avenue bridge and then turns left onto the ramp leading onto Laurier Avenue (Ottawa). While the New Guard is en route to Parliament Hill the Old Guard forms up behind the East Block with the colour. They set off at approximately 9:46 a.m. with the Pipes and Drums of the Ceremonial Guard leading. They march to the east lawn and move into position, then they await the New Guard arriving. The New Guard makes a right turn onto Elgin Street up to the National War Memorial and onto Wellington Street before the parade arrives on Parliament Hill precisely at 10 a.m. At this time the band begins to play \\"The 10 Provinces March\\" by Howard Cable. The parade marches onto the east lawn of Parliament, with the band centred at the northernmost edge of the lawn and facing south. The old guard is in position on the west side of the east lawn and faces the east block, while the new guard marches to the east side of the lawn and faces west towards the old guard. After the old and new guards are formed from three ranks into two and independently dressed off for proper alignment, the two sergeants of the guard ‚Äì commanders of the two divisions of new guard ‚Äì advance to be inspected by the company sergeant-major. Following inspection, the number two division sergeant marches to his position while the number one division sergeant stands still. The new guard is then given the order \\"Get on parade\\", at which point they advance to the tune of \\"The British Grenadiers\\" from the band, and form up dressed off the sergeants of the guard. The new guard's persons and weapons are inspected by the company commander, and they are stood at ease. Following the inspection of the new guard, the old guard is inspected. After this inspection, the sergeants of the guard and division seconds-in-command are ordered to 'take post' ‚Äì the sergeant of the guard marches from the right flank to directly behind the guard, while the second-in-command marches from the left flank to the right. The parade is then called to the present arms for the marching on of the regimental colours (If the governor general is currently in residence at Rideau Hall, the officers wear a gold sash and march on the Queen's Colour). With the colours marched on, the new guard advances at the slow march, ceremonially 'taking up the ground' from the old guard. The old guard and new guard salute each other at present arms. Following this, the old guard commander presents the key to the Guard Room at Rideau Hall to the new guard commander. The parade is then formed into three ranks and marched off at the slow march, transitioning into the quick march. The order of march differs only in that the old guard is now at the rear.Changing of the Guard Sentry duty Two sentries at the Canadian War Memorial in Ottawa The other highly visible public duty of the Ceremonial Guard is sentry duty at Rideau Hall, as the Canadian War Memorial is sentried by the National Sentry Program. The sentries are ceremonial in nature only and do not generally perform actual guard duty; however, all are trained military personnel and procedures and orders do exist for the Ceremonial Guard to adopt an armed night guard of Rideau Hall should sufficient security threat arise. The sentries at the tomb are part of National Sentry Program (April 9‚ÄìNovember 11) of which the CG organizes. The sentries are posted daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EDT, every hour on the hour. At 9 a.m. the posting non-commissioned member (NCO) ‚Äì generally a sergeant or a master corporal but sometimes a corporal from the ranks ‚Äì marches out accompanied by the two sentries, two escorts, and a bagpiper. The posting NCO, sentries, and escorts are all dressed in full scarlet uniforms and carry rifles with bayonets fixed. The party marches to the Sussex Drive gate of Rideau Hall where the first two sentries are posted and have their duties read to them. The party then marches back to Rideau Hall itself where the two remaining sentries are posted and have their duties read. It should also be noted that the sentries may change more often due to weather issues; e.g. on an extremely hot day. Throughout the day Rideau Hall is visited by the officer commanding of the parade and the company sergeant-major. They will generally elect to observe a relief of the sentries, and sometimes the officer commanding will take a report from the sentries on duty. The officer and the guard sergeant for Rideau Hall may also elect to do rounds to check on both of the sentry posts. Grand rounds may also be executed by the commanding officer of the unit. = October 2014 Shootings = Corporal Nathan Cirillo was on sentry duty at the National War Memorial, similar to the sentries in this picture, when he was fatally shot. On October 22, 2014, a gunman attacked multiple locations at Parliament Hill. Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24 year-old reservist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, was standing guard as a ceremonial sentry at the National War Memorial when he was shot with a hunting rifle by Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau. Zehaf-Bibeau fired two shots: One at Cirillo, and one at another sentry, which missed. He then drove to Centre Block, and was subsequently killed in a firefight with Sergeant-at- Arms Kevin Vickers and RCMP Corporal Curtis Barrett. Corporal Cirillo died of his wounds later that day, at the Ottawa Hospital‚Äôs Civic Campus.  Extra functions  Fortissimo 2012 In addition to the Changing of the Guard, the Ceremonial Guard takes part in many other functions, such as the annual Governor General's review of the Guard.https://www.gg.ca/en/activities/2019/annual-inspection-ceremonial-guard This inspection takes place prior to the first Guard mount on Parliament Hill normally in late June, the Canada Day celebration (specifically the noon show) on 1 July, the \\"Fortissimo\\" Sunset Ceremony that takes place in late July or early August on Parliament Hill, and the Guard's final parade, Trooping the Colour, at the end of August. It also participates in military funerals (for example, Jack Layton's procession at Parliament), important visits (Queen Elizabeth II in 2010, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011). The Band of the Ceremonial Guard has many engagements outside of public duties. The Ceremonial Guard's main mission and focus is in Ottawa, the capital city. In between their turns, alongside the regiments forming up the Ceremonial Guard, the Ontario and Quebec area CAF personnel from the Army Primary Reserve regiments stationed in their respective provinces, alongside those from other provinces of the country, handle the guard changing duties only at the National War Memorial, reinforced by the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as part of the aforementioned National Sentry Program of the Canadian Armed Forces.

Since its formation in 1977, the group changed several music styles and line ups but remained one of the top acts of both the Croatian and Yugoslav rock scenes. Biography=Davorin Bogoviƒá fronting and departure (1977‚Äì1980) Prljavo kazali≈°te was formed in 1977 in Dubrava, part of Zagreb, the capital of the then SR Croatia. Founding members included: Jasenko Houra (rhythm guitar), Zoran Cvetkoviƒá a.k.a. Zok (lead guitar), Nino Hrastek (bass guitar) and Tihomir File≈° (drums).Artist page at Croatia Records Official site Its first vocalist became Davorin Bogoviƒá, although they were thinking about taking Davor Gobac (later of Psihomodo pop) instead. All of them, except Houra, previously played in another band called Cifer≈°lus (Zipper), but after he joined them to form a new group, they opted for the name Prljavo kazali≈°te (meaning in Croatian language: Dirty Theatre) after an episode of the satirical Italian comic book Alan Ford, which was very popular in the former Yugoslavia. In its early beginnings, Prljavo kazali≈°te was a punk band, although they initially wanted to sound like The Rolling Stones for whom they maintained a great admiration. The group performed live for the first time in 1978 at a gig organized by the magazine Polet where they were noted for their furious punk image and stage performance. In the same year, Prljavo kazali≈°te released its first single, the punk rock sounding Televizori for the major record label Jugoton. It featured three songs: Televizori, Majka and Moje djetinjstvo. In 1979, Suzy Records released their second single Moj je otac bio u ratu. That song was included in the compilation album Novi Punk Val compiled by Igor Vidmar, along with Pankrti, Paraf and other prominent artists of the former Yugoslav punk scene. In 1979, they released their first eponymous album, produced by Piko Stanƒçiƒá, for Suzy Records. It was promoted when the group performed as a support act of the Yugoslav band Bijelo dugme at a concert held at the JNA Stadium. During the recording sessions, Zoran Cvetkoviƒá left the band and was replaced by Marijan Brkiƒá. The album soon came to prominence all over the former Yugoslav federation for its social commentary and provoked the then-ruling one-party system, additionally because it also featured probably the first gay-themed song in Yugoslavia titled \\"Neki djeƒçaci (Some Boys)\\" (followed later by \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" by Idoli). The authorities valuated the album as \\"≈°und\\" (\\"kitsch\\") and hence they imposed higher taxes on its sale price, while the records considered \\"truly artistic\\" enjoyed a reduced tax rate. Despite that, the group was not banned and it could freely continue to work and sell records, because non-aligned Yugoslavia was not so strict regarding censorship as the other communist states. Although the band played on the album in a rudimentary manner, the media and the public proclaimed it one of the best debut albums ever released in Yugoslavia. The record sleeve was designed by Mirko Iliƒá and featured a parody of the famous John Pasche's Tongue and Lips design with an added safety pin, representing the band's equal respect for both punk rock and The Rolling Stones. On their second album titled Crno bijeli svijet (Black and White World) released in 1980, Prljavo kazali≈°te affiliated with the new wave music, accepting a more polished image and sound. The album, again produced by Piko Stanƒçiƒá and released for Suzy, was recorded in Milan, Italy. The album included several Ska and Two Tone songs such as the main single Crno bijeli svijet and Mi ple≈°emo, meaning We Dance, although the original title was supposed to be Mi pijemo (We Drink). Also, it featured a cover version of Sedamnaest ti je godina tek by the notable retro traditional pop singer Ivo Robiƒá. The record was a major success and Prljavo kazali≈°te became one of the leading acts of the former Yugoslav new wave scene (called \\"Novi val\\" in Croatian). Jasenko Houra fronting, Bogoviƒá's return (1981‚Äì1983) Soon afterwards, Davorin Bogoviƒá left the group. Reasons included disagreements with the other band members or his inability to withstand the pressure of extensive touring and recording, as the band was already in the top of the Yugoslav rock scene and had tight schedules. In 1981, the group recorded its third album in the studio of Sjunne Ferger in Sweden. The album was produced by Tini Varga, featuring guest appearances by the percussionists Ferger and Miroslav Budanko and the saxophonist Janne Gustafsson. Since Bogoviƒá's departure, this time Jasenko Houra had to take over the position of a main vocalist. With this album, Prljavo kazali≈°te gradually moved on to a more conventional rock, hence achieving great mainstream success across whole Yugoslavia. The album featured a tribute to Bruce Springsteen (the songs Heroj ulice and ≈†iroke ulice) and to Phil Collins in the ballad Noƒáas sam iza≈°ao na ki≈°u. After the release of the record, File≈° and Hrastek were conscripted in the Yugoslav People's Army, so the group performed with the help of the drummer Dra≈æen ≈†olc and the former member Zoran Cvetkoviƒá who played bass this time. The latter released a solo album from which one song was included in the Vruƒái dani i vrele noƒái compilation and he later joined the group Dorian Gray in 1982. In 1983, Davorin Bogoviƒá returned to the band, and sang on their fourth album Korak od sna released jointly by Suzy and CBS Records, which featured the hit Sve je lako kad si mlad. That was Prljavo kazali≈°te's last record with Bogoviƒá and after he left he was replaced as a frontman by Mladen Bodalec, the album's back vocalist, a former member of Patrola. Between others, on this album is song \\"Dobar vjetar u ledja\\" (\\"Good wind in the back\\"), which is some sort of homage to legendary Hollywood actor Montgomery Clift. Mladen Bodalec fronted Prljavo Kazali≈°te (1984‚Äìpresent) With Bodalec, the group released its fifth album Zlatne godine in the beginning of 1986. This record was pop-rock oriented and it included the successful hits: Ne zovi mama doktora, Sladoled and Ma kog me boga za tebe pitaju. Unlike their previous Suzy Records albums, this one was signed for Jugoton. In 1988, Prljavo kazali≈°te released their sixth album Zaustavite Zemlju which included several hits such as Zaustavite zemlju, Marina, Moj bijeli labude and Sla≈æi mi. The album, which was released for Suzy, included the song Mojoj majci which Houra tributed to his recently deceased mother. At that time, shortly before the upcoming breakup of Yugoslavia, tensions broke out between the constituent countries of the Yugoslav federation, so the issue of an eventual Croatian independence from Yugoslavia started to rise. Hence the lyrics Zadnja ru≈æa Hrvatska (meaning: Last Croatian Rose) made the song very popular in Croatia, but also criticized in some parts of the rest of Yugoslavia due to (perceived) nationalist undertones, which were considered politically incorrect for the Yugoslav policy of brotherhood and unity. After the album's release, Marijan Brkiƒá left to join Parni valjak and was replaced with Damir Lipo≈°ek. The band went on an international tour which culminated with a big open-air show played on October 17, 1989 on the Republic Square in Zagreb in front of approximately 200,000‚Äì300,000 people. In the following year, the group released its double live album titled after the song Sve je lako kad si mlad ‚Äì LIVE!. Beside live material from the concert held in November 1988 at the Zagreb's Dom Sportova and from the performance at the ZG Rock Forces festival, it included few older studio tracks as well. The record sleeve again featured the band's logo as on the first album but on a black background. During the same year, Prljavo kazali≈°te recorded a new studio album titled Devedeseta (meaning: Ninetieth, as in 1990), produced by Mate Do≈°en, while the backing vocals were recorded by Davorin Bogoviƒá and Vesna Do≈°en. The group also got a new member, the keyboards player Mladen Ro≈°ko. In the beginning of the 1990s, Prljavo kazali≈°te frequently played shows abroad for the Croatian diaspora. During the first years of the Croatian War of Independence, which established the Republic of Croatia as an independent state, the group paused its activities and in 1993 with the new keyboard player Fedor Boiƒá (former member of ITD bend) released the album Lupi petama for InterService label with the patriotic war songs Lupi petama, Pet dana ratujem, subotom se zaljubljujem and others. The group adopted elements of folk music and a traditional tambura orchestra from Vinkovci appeared on their track Uzalud vam trud sviraƒçi. The record cover featured a plate filled with bullets. In 1994 Prljavo kazali≈°te received the Croatian Porin music award for this album, but also in other categories as well. In 1995 the group released a new live album recorded at the open-air concert held on Christmas Eve at Dolac Market titled Bo≈æiƒáni koncert (Christmas Concert). In the end of 1996 the album S vremena na vrijeme with a luxurious cover came out for Croatia Records, however it didn't bring any fresh ideas. The recorded material was mixed and pre-mastered in London, UK with the help of Zoran Cvetkoviƒá. The album included a guest appearance by Mel Gaynor, the drummer of Simple Minds. Jasenko Houra formed a record label called CBS a pun to CBS Records for whom the group once released an album, and the abbreviation for the band's best known song Crno Bijeli Svijet. In the late 1997 Prljavo kazali≈°te celebrated 20th anniversary by playing a concert with a symphony orchestra at the Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall and released the recordings as a live album titled XX Godina on Houra's new label. In 1998 the group released its album Dani ponosa i slave, which was the first studio album released after the 20th anniversary. It included guest appearance by the Croatian rap music group Tram 11. In the 2000s (decade), Prljavo kazali≈°te released a four audio CD box set titled Sve je lako kad si mlad (not to be confused with the previously mentioned live album with the same title). Its record sleeve again featured the band's logo, but this time on a white background as it was on the first album. In the end of 2002, Prljavo kazali≈°te signed a contract with Dallas Records which released their album Radio Dubrava in the following year. In 2003, the band took part in the rockumentary Sretno dijete which covers the former Yugoslav new wave scene and features many eminent former Yugoslav rock acts from Zagreb, Belgrade and Ljubljana. In 2005, the band released the album Moj dom je Hrvatska. In 2008, the band released the double album Tajno ime which was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. The following year a compilation of live recordings Best of Live and a DVD live album XXX godina live, celebrating their 30th anniversary. In 2012, the band released the album Mo≈æda dogodine featuring the guest appearance by Davorin Bogoviƒá. In 2014, Prljavo Kazali≈°te releases single Tamni slapovi, which announces a new album which will be released in late 2015. Awards and tributes The book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music) ranked the album Crno bijeli svijet as the 36th best album released in former Yugoslavia. The songs from the album, \\"Mi ple≈°emo\\" appeared on the 47th and \\"Crno bijeli svijet\\" on the 60th place on the 100 best former Yugoslav rock songs selected by the listeners of the Serbian Radio B92. The band was awarded with the Porins for the best album of the year 1994 and best rock albums in 1998 and 1999. A Polish language cover version of the Prljavo kazali≈°te's song Crno bijeli svijet, translated as Czarno-Bia≈Çy ≈öwiat performed by Kazik was included in the tribute album titled Yugoton released in Poland in 2001. The record is a tribute to the former Yugoslav rock scene.

Streetcars last ran in 1930, and in 1972 the company's operations were merged into the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). History The company was first chartered as the Natick Electric Street Railway on August 10, 1891. The name was changed to the South Middlesex Street Railway in 1893. That company went bankrupt and a receiver was appointed May 6, 1903; the property was sold on August 15, 1907 to the newly formed Middlesex and Boston Street Railway. By 1910, Boston Suburban Electric Companies, a holding company, had bought the M&B.; In September 1964 the MBTA began subsidizing the M&B;, and route numbers were given to its buses. (According to \\"A Chronicle of the Boston Transit System\\" (April 16, 1981) the subsidy agreement was signed on December 23, 1964.) The M&B; was taken over by the MBTA on July 5, 1972, after a financial dispute over subsidies stopped service on June 30. The routes taken over were renumbered by adding a 5 to the beginning and were renumbered in September 1982 and some in 1996. There is one streetcar and one bus preserved from this railway, trolley # 41, a former Lexington car, and bus # 192, a 1948 ACF Brill bus. They are both located at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. Auburndale‚ÄìLake Street via Commonwealth Avenue Wide median of Commonwealth Avenue in Auburndale, once used by M&B; trolleys, near Norumbega Park The Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway was opened on March 26, 1896. The line ran down the median the entire length of Commonwealth Avenue in Newton from Auburndale to , where it connected with the Commonwealth Avenue line of the Boston Elevated Railway. The latter line did not opened until August 15, 1896; omnibuses were temporarily run between Reservoir and Lake Street. The company opened Norumbega Park on June 17, 1897 as an amusement park to increase traffic on the line. Through service between Norumbega Park and was run from January 17, 1903 to November 1, 1914. In December 1895, the company was denied rights to construct a branch over Center Street from its not-yet- complete Commonwealth Avenue line to Newton Center because of its refusal to pay for street widening. However, the branch was later approved and constructed, allowing the line to complete with the Newton and Boston Street Railway's Newton Center branch. An extension from Newton Center to Newton Highlands via Cypress, Paul, and Center opened on June 15, 1899. The line was consolidated into the Newton Street Railway on January 1, 1904; the Newton Street Railway was merged with the M&B; on July 1, 1909. The Commonwealth Avenue line was the last of the M&B; streetcar routes to be converted to buses; this occurred in April 1930. The park closed in 1964. Route 35 Auburndale‚ÄìLake Street was not initially operated by the MBTA upon the July 1972 takeover. The MBTA resumed service in January 1973 as rush hour-only route 535 Auburndale‚ÄìBoston College via Commonwealth Avenue. Largely used by domestic workers commuting to wealthy neighborhoods in Newton, it was dropped in June 1976. Bedford‚ÄìLowell From Bedford, cars left every 15 minutes in the summer, and every half-hour in the winter, for * Boston via Lexington with a change at Arlington Heights * Maynard and Hudson with a change at Concord * Lowell with a change at Billerica Fare limits were at the town lines of Bedford with Lexington, Concord, and Billerica. The line from Lexington ran down Bedford Street and the Great Road, diverting along Loomis Street and South Road to connect with the Boston and Maine Railroad station. A passing track was located on the north side of Bedford Common. As at Norumbega, an amusement park was built in Lexington near the Bedford town line, to attract riders from the city. The Bedford‚ÄìArlington Heights bus, today's 62 was M&B; route 29 and MBTA route 529. The car-barn and electricity generator were located in North Lexington north of Bedford Street and just west of the corner of what is now Worthen Road. The complex was composed of at least a long wooden building (the carbarn) and a squat brick structure with a short smokestack (the generating plant); that complex was a lumberyard for many years and was redeveloped in the late 1980s. Waltham‚ÄìNewton The Waltham and Newton Street Railway was chartered on July 13, 1866, and began service on August 31, 1868. Its tracks ran from the split between Pleasant Street and Main Street, west of Waltham center, via Main Street, Moody Street, Crescent Street and Moody Street to the Newton line, then via Lexington Street, River Street, Elm Street and Washington Street to end at Highland Street in West Newton. In 1889 the Newton Street Railway bought the line, and the Newton Street Railway was merged with the M&B; July 1, 1909. It later (by 1964) became much of the 20 Newton Corner‚ÄìRiverside via Roberts and Central Square Waltham bus line, with the 27 Newton Corner‚ÄìRiverside via Auburndale and Central Square Waltham using much of Crescent Street (the 20 went straight through on Moody Street).

The village is located in Aurland Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. In 2014 its inhabitants numbered 350. Name The name Fl√•m is documented as early as 1340 as Flaam. It is derived from the plural dative form of the Old Norse word fl√° meaning \\"plain, flat piece of land\\", and it refers to the flood plains of the Fl√•m River. (\\"A plain between steep mountains\\" is the toponomy of the encyclopedia Store Norske Leksikon.) Fl√•m in Fl√•msdalen at the inner end of Aurlandsfjorden History In 1670 Fl√•m Church was built, replacing an older stave church. In 1923, the construction of the Fl√•m Line railway was financed by the Norwegian Parliament.Fl√•msbanen (In 1908, the decision to build the line was made.) In 1942, regular operation of (steam-powered) trains started on the Fl√•m Line. \\"In the 1960s, cruise ships stayed on the fjord\\" [without reaching the port], according to Dagens N√¶ringsliv.DRIT OG DRA - Dritt p√• verandaen og fremmede i stua.

Transportation The closest airport is Sogndal Airport, Hauk√•sen, approximately from Fl√•m. The European route E16 highway between Oslo and Bergen runs through Fl√•m. The village sits about southwest of the municipal centre of Aurlandsvangen, south of the village of Undredal, and east of the village of Gudvangen (through the Gudvanga Tunnel). The navvy road, Rallarvegen stretches from Myrdal down to Fl√•m. (Pedestrians and bicyclists still use it.) At Myrdal it connects with the navvy road for the previously built Bergen Line. Tourism The village of Fl√•m has since the late 19th century been a tourist destination. It currently receives almost 450,000 visitors a year. Most ride the Fl√•m Line between Fl√•m and Myrdal, one of the steepest railway tracks at 1 in 18 (not counting rack railways) in the world. There are also a few spirals. A former rail station building in Fl√•m now houses a museum dedicated to the Fl√•m railway. The harbour of Fl√•m receives some 160 cruise ships per year. Complaints about and suggested curbs on tourism In a 2005 Bergens Tidende article, Kjetil Sm√∏r√•s (a hotel director and chairman of Fjord Norge said that \\"The cruise traffic pollutes more than several ten thousands of cars, and many of the worst ships sail up here (...) cruise tourists trod down the pristine Norwegian nature, and destroy the foundation for Vestlandet's four entries on Unesco's World Heritage lists\\".Strid i kj√∏lvannet av cruiseturismen In 2009, Jens Riisn√¶s (an author and NRK journalist) said \\"We have the world's most beautiful nation, we don't need to follow cruise operators' premisser. They can go other places with their polluting ships. It is unwanted noise.\\" In 2009, Dagens N√¶ringsliv said that a report by Vestlandsforskning says that both \\"Fl√•m and Geiranger are nearing a limit in capacity. It might be an alternative and rather stand forth as a ¬´relaxed¬ª, exclusive and somewhat less of a mass tourism, cruise destination.\\" In a 2014 Dagens N√¶ringsliv article, a farmer said that \\"Previously the smell of summer was that of grass that had been cut.

In Norway, cruise ships are permitted to dump overboard their greywater in the postcard-narrow fjord-arms. Furthermore, the news article says that defecation in public by tourists, is already a problem; the village's train station has the only public toilets, and 200,000 tourists are expected in the summer season. In 2014, tourism professor (professor i reiseliv) Arvid Viken said that \\"it is about time this [type of] tourism is evaluated somewhat more soberly than how it has been done in many municipalities for some years\\".

Its line is now the 59 Needham Junction ‚Äì Watertown Square via Newtonville bus. History A modern- day #59 bus leaving Watertown Square The Newton and Boston Street Railway was organized in 1891. It soon opened an electric trolley line between Newton Upper Falls and Newtonville, with regular service beginning August 31, 1892. An 1897 map and an 1899 map show a branch to Newton Centre. The 1899 map also shows a branch of the Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway very closely paralleling it. In 1899, the company proposed a never-built line between Reservoir and Newton Center via Beacon Street. The Newtonville and Watertown Street Railway was leased October 1, 1897, allowing it to continue northeast to Watertown. An extension southwest to Needham center was built in 1906. On October 9, 1909, the Newton and Boston was merged into the Middlesex and Boston Street Railway. The line was bustituted in 1926. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority began to subsidize the route in September 1964, and assigned it the number 32 Needham‚ÄìWatertown. When the MBTA took over the M&B; on June 30, 1972, it was renumbered to 532. It was again renumbered in September 1982, and is now the 59 Needham Junction ‚Äì Watertown Square via Newtonville. Route The only changes from the original route to the present day have been at Newton Upper Falls. The original alignment was rather circuitous, looping north of Eliot Street on High, Summer and Chestnut Streets, presumably to avoid steep grades. An alignment in the mid-1970s used a one-way pair, with the northbound direction looping south of Eliot Street. It now uses the old northbound side (Oak and Chestnut Streets) in both directions, the opposite of the original route. Until 20 April 1981, the route only went north from Needham Center; it was extended at that time to Needham Junction. 59A Needham Street‚ÄìWatertown Square was added in December 1984, running Watertown to Newton Highlands and splitting there onto its own alignment to the Needham Industrial Park. 59A service was merged into 59 in December 1989, with alternate weekday trips using the 59A alignment (and continuing to Newton Junction). The branch to Newton Centre split from the main route (on Walnut Street), heading east on Homer Street. It turned south on Centre Street, southeast on Willow Street, south on Sumner Street, and west on Beacon Street, ending at Centre Street.

The group travels through pagan lands spreading Christianity by performing powerful miracles, in a series of cycles that has been described to owe \\"as much to Christian doctrine, which they try to endorse, as they do to the raw material of Eastern and Mediterranean mythology, which they shamelessly exploit.\\" Among their miraculous accomplishments were the conversion of a talking leopard and a talking goat into additional companions, a feat familiar in apostolic acts. Phillip and his companions are sent by Jesus to preach in the city of the Ophianoi, pagans that worship a race of snakes and dragons. This city, named as Ophiorhyme, is identified with Hierapolis, the site of Phillip's tomb and cult. The group crosses various lands in route to the city while exorcizing monsters, which are revealed to be demons, as well as the offspring of the snakes into which the Pharaoh's sorcerers turned their staffs. After their submission, Phillip turns them into black men in order for them to build a church before disappearing. The group arrives in the city, where the inhabitants attack them and subject them to pagan trials, but they defeat them by working miracles, and ultimately reach the city's gated temple, where the Echidna or mother of the snakes is worshipped.Gospel of Philip .

Source: Queensland Parliamentary Library, 15 November 2005. In Western Australia, Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island, members are known as MLAs. However the suffix MP is also commonly used. South Australia and Tasmania have a House of Assembly and denote its members MHA. In Victoria members can use either MP or MLA. In federal parliament, members of the House of Representatives are designated MP and not MHR. Brazil In Brazil, Members of all 26 Legislative Assemblies () are called deputados estaduais (). The Federal District Legislative Assembly is actually called Legislative Chamber (), and is composed by deputados distritais (). Unlike the federal legislative body, which is bicameral, Brazilian states legislatures are unicameral. Members of the Lower House are also called deputies, but they are deputados federais (). Canada In Canada, members of legislative assemblies are members of the elected provincial legislatures and are called MLAs in all provinces and territories, except: * Ontario, where they have been called Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) since 1938 and before 1938 used both MPP and MLA, * Quebec, where they are called Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) since 1968, and * Newfoundland and Labrador, where they are called Members of the House of Assembly (MHAs); Nova Scotia, despite also having a House of Assembly, uses MLA instead. Falkland Islands Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands use the suffix MLA. In 2009 the Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands (which had existed since the 1840s) was replaced with the new Legislative Assembly. As a result, Members of the Legislative Assembly are often still referred to as Councillors. Hong Kong Members of Hong Kong Legislative Council are referred to as Legco Councillors. India Out of the 28 states and 8 Union Territories (According To 104th amendment act of India, there is a legislature in all the 28 states and 2 Union Territories (Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir (Union Territory) ). A person, provided he is qualified, is elected as an MLA on the basis of universal adult suffrage by an electorate consisting of all citizens above the age of 18 of that state or UT. In some states, the Governor may appoint 1 member to represent minorities, e.g. the Anglo-Indian community, if he finds that minority inadequately represented in the Legislative Assembly. Those elected or nominated (by the Governors) to Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) are referred to as Members of Legislative Assembly or MLAs. Each legislative constituency of the State or UT is represented by only one MLA. As outlined in the Constitution of India, the number of legislative seats in a legislature cannot be more than 500 members and fewer than 60 members. However, with an Act of Parliament, the seats can be fewer than 60, as such is the case in the states of Goa, Sikkim, Mizoram and the UT of Puducherry. Depending on the population and other factors, each State or UT has varying numbers of MLAs, the highest being in the state of Uttar Pradesh (403) and the least in the UT of Puducherry (30). Owing to parliamentary democracy, wherein some members of the legislature also act as the executive, some MLAs may have triple responsibilities: as an MLA, as a cabinet minister of a department and/or as a chief minister of that state. Malaysia Members of a state legislative assembly comprises elected representatives from single-member constituencies during state elections through the first-past-the-post system. The majority party in each assembly forms the state government, and the leader of the majority party becomes chief minister of the state. The state legislative assemblies are unicameral, unlike the bicameral Parliament of Malaysia. The hereditary rulers or governors are vested with powers to dissolve their respective state legislative assemblies on the advice of the chief minister. Once dissolved, elections must be carried out within an interim period of sixty (60) days. Usually, state elections are held simultaneously with the federal parliamentary elections, with the exception of Sarawak, and before 2004, Sabah. Northern Ireland Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland are known as MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly). The Assembly was suspended on October 14, 2002 but the persons elected to it at the 2003 Assembly Election were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006 for the purpose of electing a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and choosing the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland. Another election was held on 7 March 2007 and powers were restored to the Assembly in May 2007.

It was revealed to the public for the first time in 1976 as the PSP (Polizei-Selbstlade- Pistole‚Äî\\"police self-loading pistol\\").Wo≈∫niak, Ryszard: Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej‚Äîtom 2 G-≈Å, page 112. Bellona, 2001. History Prompted by the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre, the German police decided to replace the .32 ACP Walther PP with a similarly sized but more effective 9√ó19mm Parabellum pistol. The new firearm was to meet the following requirements: chamber the 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge, weigh no more than , the pistol's dimensions would not exceed 180 √ó 130 √ó 34 mm, it should have a muzzle energy of no less than 500 J and a service life of at least 10,000-rounds. The pistol was also to be fully ambidextrous, safe to carry with a loaded chamber (both holstered and concealed in a pocket), and able to be quickly drawn and instantly ready to fire. As a result of a competitive bid the German police forces selected three different pistols into service: the Swiss SIG Sauer P225 (designated the P6) and two German designs‚Äîthe P7 (officially designated the PSP) and the Walther P5. Series production of the P7 started in 1979. Shortly after, the pistol was adopted by the German Federal Police's counter-terrorism unit (GSG 9) and the German Army's special forces formations. The P7 was produced primarily by H&K; but also under license by the Greek defense firm Hellenic Arms Industry as well as in Mexico by the Departamento de Industria Militar (DIM), as a sidearm for general officers and staff. The pistol was also exported to several countries. Design details=Operating mechanism gas-delayed blowback system. The P7 is a semi-automatic blowback-operated firearm. It features a unique gas-delayed blowback system modeled on the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined‚Äîafter the bullet has left the barrel‚Äîhence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case. The chamber has 18 flutesthat aid in the extraction process by allowing combustion gases to flow between the fired case and the chamber walls, preventing the case from \\"sticking\\" to the chamber walls. The drawback of this system is that the breech \\"opens\\" slightly prematurely to allow the slide to initiate its rearward motion. The high temperature gases cycling through a tube located below the chamber area and above the trigger made the early versions of this pistol uncomfortable, according to some, to shoot after the content of two magazines were fired due to heating. The advantages of this system are a simpler manufacturing process due to the absence of a locking system and a high mechanical accuracy due to the barrel being fixed in the frame; the barrel does not execute any sort of lateral or vertical movement during the operating cycle as with the Browning cam-action systems common to many other locked breech pistols. Features The P7's spring extractor is contained within the slide, while the fixed ejector is a surface on the slide catch. The grip of this pistol features a built-in cocking lever located at the front of the grip. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed; thus this lever acts as a safety. The pistol is striker fired. Squeezing the cocking lever with a force of cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired. The trigger and firing mechanism's method of operation (and the unique slide catch) were protected by , issued on January 2, 1979. The P7 is fed from a single-stack box magazine with a capacity of 8 rounds, which is held inside the firearm's frame with a release located at the heel of the grip. After the last round has been fired, the slide will remain open thanks to a slide catch that can be released by pulling the slide further back or pressing the squeeze cocker. The firearm uses a fixed, polygonal rifled barrel (hexagonal with a 250 mm twist rate) and a fixed notched iron sight with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced through the use of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard. Between 1982 and 1983 the P7 received several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications resulted in the P7M8 model. A new magazine release lever (available on both sides of the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.  Variants  P7M8 with Karl Nill wood grips. Heckler & Koch P7M13. Heckler & Koch P7K3 (.22 LR slide and barrel installed, additional .32ACP (7.65mm) slide, barrel and two magazines are visible, so are the exchange tool and carbon scraper) Heckler & Koch P7K3 Heckler & Koch P7K3 using the exchange tool to tighten to barrel nut to install a .32ACP barrel Based on the P7 several other variants were built: the P7PT8, P7M13, P7K3, P7M10 and the P7M7, none of which remain in production. Production of the \\"P7\\" heel release design ended in 1997 with the KH date coded pistol marked \\"P7\\" on the Grip and \\"PSP\\" on the slide. The P7PT8 is a dedicated, straight blowback training pistol modified for use with the 9√ó19mm PT training cartridge (made by Geco) with a plastic bullet (weighing 0.42 g). A \\"floating chamber\\" adapter is used inside the barrel which enhances felt recoil for use with the special ammunition. The pistols were marked with blue dots on both sides of the slide to differentiate the P7PT8 from other P7 pistols that can chamber lethal ammunition. To date about 200 pistols of this type were produced that are used mainly for simulated firing in enclosed spaces. The P7M8 is the P7's counterpart with larger trigger guard, lengthened trigger, heat shield, thumb operated magazine release, larger rear sight dovetail, protruding firing pin bushing and lanyard ring. Production began in 1983 and continued until 2007. A final production run of 500 P7M8 pistols were produced under the AH date code (year 2007).P7 serial number Each is marked on the right side of the slide with X of 500. Other than the slide marking no other features nor accessories were added to the usual kit. To commemorate 25 years of P7 production, H&K; offered a limited run of P7M8 \\"Jubilee\\" edition. Only 500 examples were ever made. Included in the package were a wooden lockable presentation case, P7 challenge coin, and special markings. The slide's top-left radiused edge has the designer's name (Helmut Weldle) and \\"1 von 500\\" (German, and including the double quotes; it translates to \\"1 of 500\\" in English) etched onto its surface. The wooden grips were made by Karl Nills and had the H&K; logo. The P7M13 is the P7's counterpart with a double-stack magazine and a 13-round capacity. This pistol was offered (unsuccessfully) to the US Army. A variant known as the P7M13SD was produced in limited numbers exclusively for German special forces, featuring a longer (compared to the P7M13) threaded barrel and a sound suppressor. The P7K3 is a shortened version of the P7 (inspired by the HK4 pistol) that uses straight blowback for operation. This version has a removable barrel and uses a sealed hydraulic recoil buffer in place of a gas cylinder. After swapping out the barrel and magazine it can use .380 ACP (9√ó17mm Short) or .32 ACP (7.65√ó17mm Browning SR) pistol cartridges and after replacing the slide, magazine and barrel (with floating chamber insert)‚Äîit can also be used to fire .22 LR (5.6mm Long Rifle) ammunition. The hydraulic recoil buffer of the P7K3 is prone to wear and causes a serious problem to operate the gun when it is worn down. Heckler & Koch does not make a replacement part for the buffer. However, there are some commercial buffers available. When the .22 LR slide and barrel are installed, the buffer is not engaged. The slide of the .22 LR has an opening at the front that allows the buffer to be unused when firing the gun. Heckler & Koch provides a special scraper tool for the .22 LR-barrel. The tool is needed to clean the inside of the floating chamber for safe operation. An additional exchange tool is provided for all calibers to screw and unscrew the barrel nut that attaches the barrel to the frame. Both tools can be seen in one of the pictures of the P7K3 on this page. P7K3's are more rare in the U.S. than in Europe and are valued at higher prices especially when they are in good condition. The P7M10 was introduced to the American market in 1991. It is chambered for the .40 S&W; (10√ó22mm Smith & Wesson) round and has a double- stack 10-round magazine. With the American market in mind, a variant known as the P7M7 designed to use the .45 ACP (11.43√ó23mm Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge was also created. However, it remained only a prototype due to excessive costs and complexity of creating such a weapon.

Lane has authored two books, an autobiography, Billy Lane's Chop Fiction: It's not a Motorcycle, Baby, It's a Chopper (2004, Motorbooks International) and Billy Lane's How to Build Old School Choppers, Bobbers And Customs (2005, Motorbooks International). Lane also holds an associate degree from Florida State University as well as a Bachelor in Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Florida International University, graduating in 1997. September 2006 drunk-driving fatal crash On September 5, 2006, driving a promotional 2006 Dodge Ram on Florida Route A1A, his driving license having been revoked in a previous incident in North Carolina, Lane crossed a double yellow line to pass two cars, striking head-on the 1983 Yamaha motorcycle ridden by 56-year-old Gerald Morelock, a park ranger at Sebastian Inlet State Park, in the oncoming lane. Morelock suffered extensive injuries, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Lane turned himself in on Monday, September 21 in connection with the fatal crash, facing charges including driving under the influence and manslaughter, his BAC having registered 0.192 at the scene of the crash, more than twice the Florida legal limit of 0.08. Gerald Morelock's family filed a lawsuit against Lane and Chrysler. Billy Lane entered a plea of \\"not guilty\\" the day he was officially charged with the second-degree felony. The incident drew a range of responses from the motorcycle community, with some calling for stiffer penalties because Lane was himself a motorcyclist, and others calling for leniency for the same reason. On August 14, 2009, Lane was convicted (pleading no contest) on one count of vehicular homicide and sentenced to 6 years in prison, 3 years of supervised probation, and loss for life of his driver's license. In arguing for the maximum sentence, the prosecuting attorney cited speeding violations and a pattern of poor driving on Lane's driving record. A judge had earlier approved a plea deal where prosecutors dropped the felony DUI and manslaughter charges. Prior to the plea deal, Lane had been facing up to 30 years in prison. Lane was incarcerated at the Avon Park Work Camp with a projected release date of 10/20/2014. As of 02/24/2013, according to the Florida Department of Corrections website, he was at the Orlando Transition Center (male facility) and released 09/18/2014. Previously, in June 2006, Lane had also been arrested by the North Carolina Highway Patrol and charged with drunk driving. After refusing to take a breathalyzer test at the scene and leaving prosecutors without evidence presentable in court, Lane was found not guilty. Because his license had, however, been revoked in North Carolina, he had lost his right to drive in Florida at the time of the fatal crash. Closures at his Choppers, Inc. shop at the time of his arrests were coincidental; it had been closed for renovation.

The Palais des congr√®s (Congress Hall) building lying just east of the district is also usually comprised in it. Constructed dispersedly between 1965 and 1985 in place of older colonial housing blocks, the district underwent major urban renewal as a central business district in 2000‚Äì2003. { align=\\"right\\" width=\\"200px\\" style=\\"margin:0 0 1em 1em\\" - The Montreal World Trade Centre west entrance on Victoria Square. Complexe Maisonneuve and the back of Place de la Cit√© internationale, seen at night from Victoria Square. } Purpose The main purpose of the project was to restore the continuity of Montreal's downtown, broken by the gaping trench of the Ville-Marie Expressway since the 1960s, and thus to bridge the following areas: * The existing downtown business district centred on Place Ville Marie (northwest); * The Saint Laurent Boulevard/Sainte Catherine Street entertainment district and Chinatown (northeast); * The historic Old Montreal district (southeast); * The Cit√© du Multim√©dia high-tech development district (southwest). Other goals included the beautification of the built environment, creation of elegant city squares, showcase of Quebec design and public art, and stimulation of world- class real estate development at the heart of Montreal. The completed area of 27 hectares (0.27 square kilometres or nearly 67 acres), 30% of which are in the public domain, spreads on an east‚Äìwest axis above the Ville-Marie Expressway tunnels. It is bounded by Saint Urbain Street to the east, Saint Antoine Street to the south, University Street to the west and Viger Avenue to the north (plus Saint Jacques Street between McGill Street and University Street). The area is serviced by three stations on the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro and large portions of the underground city. Components The QIM itself has five main components, from east to west: Palais des congr√®s, seen from Place Jean-Paul Riopelle. Palais des congr√®s The Palais des congr√®s de Montr√©al (Montreal Convention Centre), the only building that was originally built over the expressway trench, was extended towards the west in the same manner, doubling in area while covering the first half of the western trench. The extension followed a similar design than the 1980s original, but with less concrete and more coloured glass, giving it a lighter appearance. The design, which included multicoloured panels and bright pink \\"tree\\" sculptures in the lobby, did not please everyone but is generally said to integrate well with the area. This section is connected to the Place-d'Armes Metro station. Place Jean-Paul Riopelle La Joute on Place Jean-Paul Riopelle. The public square built over the trench at the same time as the Centre CDP Capital was named Place Jean-Paul Riopelle in honour of Quebec artist Jean-Paul Riopelle who died in 2002. His fountain sculpture La Joute was then moved to the square from the Parc Olympique in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. √âdifice Jacques-Parizeau Centre CDP Capital, seen from Place Jean-Paul Riopelle. The √âdifice Jacques-Parizeau is the Montreal regional office of the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec, the main investment arm of the Quebec government. Entirely suspended over the trench, the 13-storey building was the \\"enabler\\" and is now the centrepiece of the district, stretching between Jean-Paul Riopelle and Victoria squares. Despite its strong architectural qualities, construction was marked by opposition to the huge cost overruns of an already very expensive structure, at the same time as the CDP was losing taxpayers' money from questionable investments made during the dot-com bubble. The building integrates a new W boutique hotel at the west end on Victoria Square, as well as headquarters of two international organisations: International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda) and the International Council of Societies of Industries Design (Icsid). Victoria Square Once an empty space crossed diagonally by Beaver Hall and McGill streets, Victoria Square was restored to its original configuration, that of a tree-lined square between parallel avenues. Trees and benches were added, the statue of Queen Victoria was reinstated, and special care was given to Hector Guimard's Art Nouveau outdoor entrance to the Square- Victoria-OACI Metro station. The square is now fronted on the east by the Centre CDP Capital and the Montreal World Trade Centre, to the west by Tour de la Bourse and Place de la Cit√© internationale, to the north by the Altoria/Aimia Tower, and to the south by the Quebecor building, its outdated fa√ßade fully re-designed for the occasion. Tour de la Bourse (Stock Exchange Tower) near Square Victoria Place de la Cit√© internationale and surroundings Place de la Cit√© internationale, northwest of Victoria Square, is a complex that currently consists of the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The modern 17-storey building, completed in 1995, has its main entrance on the west side on University Street. A taller second phase has been announced on the site for quite some time, to fill the void near Tour de la Bourse. Northwest of Victoria Square is the Complexe Maisonneuve, made of the two aluminum-clad Bell and National Bank of Canada towers built in 1982. Neighbouring Place Bonaventure, connected to the Bonaventure Metro station, marks the western boundary of the QIM. A tunnel built under University Street between Place de la Cit√© internationale and Place Bonaventure finally connected the eastern and western parts of the Underground City which had previously been separated. Design ICAO World Headquarters Sidewalks were widened and re-paved in order to increase the pedestrian area by 40%. Open-air parking lots were eliminated and replaced with 1,300 new parking spaces added under the Palais des Congr√®s, Place Jean- Paul Riopelle, and the Centre CDP Capital. Several trees were planted, and distinctive street furniture and street lighting was installed, including 22 backlit columns adorned with world flags in the median divider on University Street, welcoming southern arrivals from the Bonaventure Expressway. Cl√©ment Demers was responsible for overall project design, working with Consortium Daoust Lestage and Provencher, Roy et associ√©s, with engineers Groupe conseil Genivar. Architect and urban planner Jean-Claude Marsan also consulted on the project. As of September 2005, the project had received 22 awards in 13 different domains, including the PMI Project of the Year 2005 from the Project Management Institute of Philadelphia. The project's success played a part in the decision of the World Anti-Doping Agency and International Design Alliance to move to Montreal, joining the ICAO, IATA and several other international organizations. Chef Normand Laprise's world-famous Toqu√©! restaurant moved from its tiny Saint Denis Street location to the Centre CDP Capital on Place Jean-Paul Riopelle, putting the QIM on the international gastronomy map. The district has become a prestigious address for real estate development, with upscale housing built and under construction totalling approximately 1000 units as of 2005. Management The project was managed by the Soci√©t√© du Quartier international de Montr√©al, a nonprofit organization created in July 1999 by the federal government of Canada, province of Quebec and city of Montreal, as well as the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement and the Association des riverains du Quartier international de Montr√©al (ARQIM). The initial budget for the project was CAD$76 million (approx. US$57 million); the actual cost was $90 million (US$68 million). According to QIM's management, more than half of the overrun resulted from additional work requested by the city, as well as additional expropriation costs. Total investment in the district from all sources was approximately $860 million (US$650 million) between 2000 and 2003. Future projects Current projects include the beautification of McGill Street south of Victoria Square towards Old Montreal. There are long-term plans to continue the covering of the Ville-Marie Expressway further east to the currently dilapidated Viger Square behind City Hall, where the new land may be used for expansion of the mega-hospital Centre hospitalier de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al built north of the expressway.

It is NP-complete but fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded treewidth. Problem statement The monochromatic triangle problem takes as input an n-node undirected graph G(V,E) with node set V and edge set E. The output is a Boolean value, true if the edge set E of G can be partitioned into two disjoint sets E1 and E2, such that both of the two subgraphs G1(V,E1) and G2(V,E2) are triangle-free graphs, and false otherwise. This decision problem is NP-complete.. A1.1: GT6, pg.191. Generalization to multiple colors The problem may be generalized to triangle-free edge coloring, finding an assignment of colors to the edges of a graph so that no triangle has all three edges given the same color. The monochromatic triangle problem is the special case of triangle-free edge-coloring when there are exactly two colors available. If there exists a two-color triangle-free edge coloring, then the edges of each color form the two sets E1 and E2 of the monochromatic triangle problem. Conversely, if the monochromatic triangle problem has a solution, we can use one color for E1 and a second color for E2 to obtain a triangle-free edge coloring. Connection to Ramsey's theorem By Ramsey's theorem, for any finite number k of colors, there exists a number n such that complete graphs of n or more vertices do not have triangle-free edge colorings with k colors. For k = 2, the corresponding value of n is 6. That is, the answer to the monochromatic triangle problem on the complete graph K6 is no. Parameterized complexity It is straightforward to express the monochromatic triangle problem in the monadic second-order logic of graphs (MSO2), by a logical formula that asserts the existence of a partition of the edges into two subsets such that there do not exist three mutually adjacent vertices whose edges all belong to the same side of the partition. It follows from Courcelle's theorem that the monochromatic triangle problem is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded treewidth. More precisely, there is an algorithm for solving the problem whose running time is the number of vertices of the input graph multiplied by a quickly-growing but computable function of the treewidth..

The theory is Nozick's attempt to describe \\"justice in holdings\\" (Nozick 1974:150)‚Äîor what can be said about and done with the property people own when viewed from a principle of justice.  Principles  Nozick's entitlement theory comprises three main principles: # A principle of justice in acquisition ‚Äì This principle deals with the initial acquisition of holdings. It is an account of how people first come to own unowned and natural world property, what types of things can be held, and so forth. # A principle of justice in transfer ‚Äì This principle explains how one person can acquire holdings from another, including voluntary exchange and gifts. # A principle of rectification of injustice ‚Äì how to deal with holdings that are unjustly acquired or transferred, whether and how much victims can be compensated, how to deal with long past transgressions or injustices done by a government, and so on. Nozick believes that if the world were wholly just, only the first two principles would be needed, as \\"the following inductive definition would exhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings\\": :# A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in acquisition is entitled to that holding. :# A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in transfer, from someone else entitled to the holding, is entitled to the holding. :#No one is entitled to a holding except by (repeated) applications of 1 and 2. (Nozick 1974:151) Thus, entitlement theory would imply \\"a distribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they possess under the distribution\\" (Nozick 1974:151). However, not everyone follows these rules: \\"some people steal from others, or defraud them, or enslave them, seizing their product and preventing them from living as they choose, or forcibly exclude others from competing in exchanges\\" (Nozick 1974:152). Thus the third principle of rectification is needed. Entitlement theory is based on John Locke's ideas.Justice in acquisition: \\"Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.\\" ‚Äî John Locke, Second Treatise on Government, Ch.5 Sec. 27 Justice in transfer: \\"Again, if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, pleased with its colour; or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a sparkling pebble or a diamond, and keep those by him all his life he invaded not the right of others, he might heap up as much of these durable things as he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his just property not lying in the largeness of his possession, but the perishing of any thing uselesly in it.\\" ‚Äì John Locke, Second Treatise on Government, Ch.5 Sec. 46 Under entitlement theory, people are represented as ends in themselves and equals, as Kant claimed, though different people may own (i.e. be entitled to) different amounts of property. Nozick's ideas create a strong system of private property and a free-market economy. The only just transaction is a voluntary one. Taxation of the rich to support full robust social programs for the poor is unjust because the state is acquiring money by force instead of through a voluntary transaction. However, Nozick's ideas can endorse the creation of a minimal social program for the poor. Every person in the state of nature can achieve a certain level of welfare according to their own abilities. This level of welfare, while not equal, must be maintained via the Lockean proviso. Given the justice of acquisition condition and the Lockean proviso, \\"It is conceivable that in the normal operation of the economy, a private property regime might at some times, for some people, fail to provide access to this level of welfare when left to itself. If so, then justice‚Äîas the libertarian understands it‚Äîdemands that the state act to correct the distribution of welfare generated by the spontaneous play of market forces.\\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-minimum/#2.2 Differences from other ideals Entitlement theory contrasts sharply with the Principles of Justice in Rawls' A Theory of Justice, which states that each person has an equal claim to basic rights and liberties, and that inequality should only be permitted to the degree that such inequality is \\"reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage\\" (Rawls 1999: 53). There is a further provision that such inequalities are only permissible insofar as there is an equality of opportunity to benefit from these inequalities. Nozick instead argues that people who have or produce certain things have rights over them: \\"on an entitlement view, [production and distribution] are not ... separate questions ... things come into the world already attached to people having entitlements over them\\" (Nozick 1974:160). Nozick believes that unjustly taking someone's holdings violates their rights. \\"Holdings to which ... people are entitled may not be seized, even to provide equality of opportunity for others\\" (Nozick 1974:235). Thus, a system which works to reduce the rightfully earned holdings of some so that they can be equally distributed to others is immoral. :\\"The major objection to speaking of everyone's having a right to various things such as equality of opportunity, life, and so on, and enforcing this right, is that these 'rights' require a substructure of things and materials and actions; and other people may have rights and entitlements over these. No one has a right to something whose realization requires certain uses of things and activities that other people have rights and entitlements over\\" (Nozick 1974:238).  Criticism  In his later work The Examined Life, Nozick reflects that entitlement theory's defense of people's holdings may have some problems, in that it could eventually lead to the vast majority of resources being pooled in the hands of the extremely skilled, or, through gifts and inheritance, in the hands of the extremely skilled's friends and children. Nozick says: :\\"Bequeathing something to others is an expression of caring about them .. yet bequests [are] sometimes passed on for generations to persons unknown to the original earner, ... producing continuing inequalities of wealth and position. .. The resulting inequalities seem unfair. :One possible solution would be to restructure an institution of inheritance so that taxes will subtract from the possessions people can bequeath the value of what they themselves have received through bequests. People then could leave to others only the amount they themselves have added. :The simple subtraction rule does not perfectly disentangle what the next generation has managed itself to contribute‚Äîinheriting wealth may make it easier to amass more‚Äîbut it is a serviceable rule of thumb\\" (Nozick 1989:30-31). Furthermore, the notion of taxation being inherently unjust, and market transactions being inherently just, depends on the notion that they actually are as involuntary or voluntary as they appear: in a nation that permits free emigration of its citizens, taxation is not entirely involuntary, while market transactions for necessary goods and services can hardly be said to be entirely voluntary, and if the wealthy, or organized labor, or those in control of de facto industry standards are able to exert undue influence on such a market, they frequently skew those transactions to favor their own interests.

Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, the ride opened on July 5, 1988, in the Norway Pavilion of the park's World Showcase section. It was a mix between a log chute and a traditional film attraction. Visitors rode boats patterned after longships that passed through various scenes that featured audio-animatronic figures. The attraction was originally supposed to be called SeaVenture, with the entrance sign during construction even displaying it as such. But sometime between March 1988 and the ride's opening, it was changed to Maelstrom. On September 12, 2014, it was announced that the ride would be replaced by an attraction based on Disney's 2013 3D computer-animated musical film Frozen. Maelstrom's final day of operation was October 5, 2014. Frozen Ever After opened on June 21, 2016. The ride Riders departed from a dock traveling by boat, which turned a corner into a dark tunnel and up the flume's lift hill. A voice tells riders that \\"those who seek the spirit of Norway face peril and adventure, but more often find beauty and charm.\\" Arriving at the top of the hill, a lit face of the Germanic god Odin hovered above. Riders passed through scenes of seafarers and maritime villages depicting a mythological version of Norway's Viking days. Entering a marsh, the boat would come face to face with audio-animatronic depictions of a Nokken and a three-headed troll. The trolls, angered by the trespassing boat, cast a spell onto riders as the vehicle began to move backward rapidly, accelerated by hidden conveyor belts underneath the water's surface. The boats floated briskly past scenes of polar bears and living trees, before coming to a stop on the edge of another waterfall, exposing the Norway pavilion's main thoroughfare. The backwards edge of the boat peeked out through the facade as the track pivoted to let the vehicle travel forward again. Correctly oriented, the boats plunged forward down a flume into a stormy depiction of the North Sea. After passing very close to an oil rig, the ride came to an abrupt end in a calm harbor of a small village, where the narrator announced, \\"Norway's spirit has always been, and will always be adventure.\\" As guests exited the ride, they had the option of watching a 5-minute tourism film, \\"The Spirit of Norway\\", which highlighted various attractions in Norway including skiing, hiking, and Kjerag mountain. Hidden Mickeys on the ride included: *In the ride's loading area, a large painted mural included many people and elements from Norway's history. Hidden in this painting was a Viking whose helmet had Mickey Mouse ears, and another figure wearing a Mickey Mouse watch. *Inside the stave church, King Olaf II had a small Mickey embroidered on his tunic, near his right thigh.

Witness tampering and reprisals against witnesses in organized crime cases have been a difficulty faced by prosecutors; witness protection programs were one response to this problem.Thomas J. Gardner & Terry M. Anderson, Criminal Law (Cengage: 13th ed. 2018), p. 517. United States In the United States, the federal crime of witness tampering is defined by statute at , which is entitled \\"tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant.\\" The statute is broad; the Justice Manual notes that it \\"proscribes conduct intended to illegitimately affect the presentation of evidence in Federal proceedings or the communication of information to Federal law enforcement officers\\" and applies to tampering with witnesses in \\"proceedings before Congress, executive departments, and administrative agencies, and to civil and criminal judicial proceedings, including grand jury proceedings.\\" Witness tampering is a crime even if a proceeding is not actually pending, and even if the testimony sought to be influenced, delayed, or prevented would not be admissible in evidence. Section 1512 also provides that the federal government has extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute the offenses described by the section. Witness tampering is a criminal offense even if the attempt to tamper is unsuccessful. The offense also covers the intimidation of not only a witness himself or herself, but also intimidation of \\"another person\\" (i.e., a third party, such as a witness's spouse) in order to intimidate the witness. Section 1512 was created as part of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA). Before that time, federal prosecutions \\"for attempting to or succeeding in corruptly influencing or intimidating witnesses\\" were prosecuted under the general obstruction of justice statute, .Tina M. Riley, Note, Tampering with Witness Tampering: Resolving the Quandary Surrounding 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1503, 1512, 77 Wash. U. L.Q. 249 (1999). VWPA established section 1512 to address the specific witness tampering issue, and simultaneously removed references to witnesses from section 1503.Brian M. Haney, Note, \\"Contrasting the Prosecution of Witness Tampering Under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1503 and 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1512: Why ¬ß 1512 Better Serves the Government at Trial,' 9 Suffolk J. Trial. & App. Advoc. 57 (2004). This led to uncertainly about whether witness tampering can now be exclusively prosecuted as a federal crime under section 1512, or whether it may also be prosecuted under section 1503 as an alternative or additional charge; the courts of appeals are split on this question. Notable people in the United States convicted of witness tampering include former South Dakota State Representative Ted Klaudt,Katie Brown, Ted Klaudt gets time added to prison sentence: Former legislator gets 10 more years for witness tampering, Rapid City Journal (January 22, 2008). political operative Roger Stone,Roger Stone guilty on all counts in federal trial of lying to Congress, witness tampering, Washington Post (November 15, 2019). real estate developer Charles Kushner,Caitlin Oprysko, Charles Kushner pens op-ed in defense of son Jared, Politico (March 31, 2019). and Nine Trey Gangsters figure Laron Spicer.Mosi Secret, With Budget Cuts, U.S. Judge Won‚Äôt Sequester Jury in Murder Case, New York Times (September 19, 2013). Witness tampering via bribery is not covered by 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1512, but is rather prohibited by a different statute, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1510. England and Wales In England and Wales, witness intimidation is one form of the crime of perverting the course of justice.Jonathan Doak, Victims' Rights, Human Rights and Criminal Justice: Reconceiving the Role of Third Parties (Hart, 2008), p. 59. Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 includes the offences of intimidating a witness and taking revenge on a witness. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 provides for protections for witnesses at risk of intimidation. International Criminal Court In 2016, Jean-Pierre Bemba, a politician from Democratic Republic of the Congo, was convicted of witness tampering in the International Criminal Court. Bemba had separately been convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes arising from atrocities committed in the Central African Republic in 2002 and 2003, for which he was sentenced to 18 years in prison.Marlise Simons, Jean-Pierre Bemba, Congolese Politician Imprisoned for War Crimes, Is Convicted of Witness Tampering, New York Times (October 20, 2016). Economic analysis Economics have analyzed witness intimidation, which is one form of witness tampering, in terms of \\"strategic complexity and two-sided uncertainty: criminals cannot know whether threats will deter witnesses, and witnesses cannot know whether threats will be carried out.\\"Brendan O'Flaherty & Rajiv Sethi, Witness Intimidation, Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 39, No. 2 (June 2010), pp. 399-432.

A crusty's transport and home may consist of a van, lorry, bus, car, or caravan converted into a mobile home. A crusty may also make use of an improvised bender tent, tipi, or yurt. \\"New Age\\" travellers largely originated in 1980s and early 1990s Britain,http://subcultureslist.com/new- age-travellers/ when they were described as crusties because of the association with \\"encrusted dirt, dirt as a deliberate embrace of grotesquerie, a statement of resistance against society, proof of nomadic hardship.\\" History=Origins The movement originated in the free festivals of the 1960s and 1970s such as the Windsor Free Festival, the early Glastonbury Festivals, Elephant Fayres, and the huge Stonehenge Free Festivals in Great Britain. However, there were longstanding precedents for travelling cultures in Great Britain, including travelling pilgrims, itinerant journeymen and traders, as well as Romani groups and others. Later events included the Castlemorton Common Festival, a huge free and unlicensed event which attracted widespread media coverage and prompted government action. Some legal festivals, such as WOMAD, continue to take place in a variety of countries, including the UK. Peace convoy In the UK during the 1980s the travellers' mobile homes‚Äîgenerally old vans, trucks and buses (including double-deckers)‚Äîmoved in convoys. One group of travellers came to be known as the Peace Convoy after visits to Peace camps associated with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). The movement had faced significant opposition from the British government and from mainstream media, epitomised by the authorities' attempts to prevent the Stonehenge Free Festival, and the resultant Battle of the Beanfield in 1985‚Äîresulting in what was, according to the Guardian, one of the largest mass arrests of civilians since at least the Second World War, https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/feb/22/features.magazine27 whilst other commentators see it as possibly one of the biggest in English legal history. possibly one of the biggest in English legal history. In 1986 and subsequent years police again blocked travellers from \\"taking the Stones\\" on the Summer Solstice (June 21). This led Travelers to spend summers squatting by the hundreds on several sites adjacent to the A303 in Wiltshire. Scenes Many people see the Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992, a weeklong festival that attracted up to 30,000 travellers and ravers, as a significant turning point for New Age Travellers in Britain, as it directly resulted in the government granting new powers to police and local authorities under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to prevent such events in the future. The Criminal Justice Act included sections against disruptive trespass, squatting and unauthorised camping which made life increasingly difficult for travellers, and many left Britain for Ireland and mainland Europe, particularly Spain. However, thousands of people still live a traveller lifestyle in Britain. Few, if any, travellers live on the local authority sites reserved for Romani/Gypsy, Scottish Gypsies/Travellers and Irish Travellers, so instead stay on unauthorised sites throughout the countryside, particularly in Wales and the south-west of England, and in urban areas. London hosts a large number of traveller sites in places such as disused factories and warehouse yards, and there is often a crossover between travellers and squatters, with travellers parking up in yards attached to squatted buildings. Typical traveller sites might have anywhere from 5 to 30 vehicles on them, including trailers and caravans as well as buses, vans, and horseboxes converted to live in. Although most travellers in Britain are British, large numbers of Continental Europeans also \\"travel\\" in the UK. As unauthorised sites are evicted and travellers moved on frequently, accessing basic services such as health and dental care, refuse collection, benefits, and education for children can be problematic. Many traveller families home- school their children. Although travellers have only taken to the road since the 1960s, many traveller families have reached their third or fourth generation. Despite widespread popular assumptions about travellers living on state handouts, many do seasonal or temporary work, on farms and building sites or in factories and pubs for example. Others work as self-employed mechanics, electricians and plumbers, or make money selling scrap (including building materials - often exotic and rare such as parquet flooring, or antique lead and copper fitting stripped illegally from private and public buildings used as illegal squats), or running stalls at markets and car boot sales. Festivals during the summer also present many opportunities for travellers to make money through offering entertainment, services and goods to festival goers. A high level of mutual aid, the sharing of childcare and vehicle maintenance and \\"skipping\\" (collecting food from local supermarket skips) within communities allow travellers to live on very low incomes. The traveller and free party scenes often have close links, and many travellers run or are involved with the sound systems of raves and squat parties. New Zealand housetruckers Housetrucks at the Nambassa 5-day festival, 1981 In New Zealand, individuals, families or groups who convert old trucks and school buses into mobile homes and live in them, preferring an unattached and transient lifestyle to using more conventional housing are termed \\"housetruckers\\". These mobile home vehicles began appearing during the mid-1970s and even though there are fewer they continue to exist. An early manifestation of this culture came with the Blerta (1970‚Äì1973) traveling circus of music, light theatre and art. This involved a well-known New Zealand actor, Bruno Lawrence, and 30 or 40 hangers-on who traveled around the country in an old Bedford bus, sang, wrote and did hippie art. Most of the riders were radicals, hippies, groovers and free thinkers. They attracted a following and had a hit single with \\"Dance around the world\\" which was nominated for the Loxene Golden Disc in 1971, a local musical award at the time. After 1973 the Blerta project ran out of steam, and Lawrence turned his hand back to acting in such movies as Smash Palace in 1981.Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, eds., Nambassa: A New Direction, A.

It was founded in 1999 by the Gaullist and former Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, then allied with Philippe de Villiers (ex-UDF). The RPF aims to fight against globalisation and European federalism. The party is opposed to further European integration. The acronym RPF was an explicit nod to Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Fran√ßais. The new party enjoyed early electoral success when it placed second in the 1999 European Parliament election in France, scoring 13 percent of the vote and winning 13 seats. This placed it behind the Socialist Party but ahead of the established centre-right parties, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic- DL list and the UDF. However Philippe de Villiers' departure in late 2000, in order to refound his Movement for France, severely damaged the party and Pasqua failed to run in the 2002 Presidential elections. The RPF has since suffered several setbacks in various elections and has failed to regain its 1999-2000 momentum, and has been eclipsed by the MPF as a party of the Eurosceptic right in France. The party won two seats in the 2002 National Assembly election, through an alliance with the UMP but lost all its MEPs in the 2004 European election. Charles Pasqua was elected Senator for the Hauts- de-Seine in the 2004 French Senate election. He sat in the UMP group. The RPF remains an associate party of the main centre-right party, the UMP.

The party replaced, in 2002, the Citizens' Movement (Mouvement des citoyens, MDC) founded by Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement, who left the Socialist Party (PS) in 1993 due to his opposition to the Persian Gulf War and to the Maastricht Treaty. It is a Eurosceptic party with leftist aspirations. Chev√®nement led the list l'autre politique (the Other Policy) for 1994 European Parliament election. It included members of left-wing opposition (socialist and communist candidates) to Maastricht Treaty, feminists, radicals and Gaullists. The MDC supported the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin for the 1995 presidential election, then integrated the Gauche plurielle coalition. From 1997 to 2000, it was represented in the government by Chev√®nement as Interior Minister. In order to prepare the 2002 presidential election, Chev√®nement created the P√¥le r√©publicain, which included a wide range of politicians: radicals, Gaullists, souverainists, socialists. He won over 5% and is sometimes blamed for Jospin's elimination. Its lack of success in the legislative election (losing all 7 MDC deputies elected in 1997) prompted Chev√®nement to rename his party the Citizen and Republican Movement. Chev√®nement was defeated in his seat in Territoire-de-Belfort. The foundation of the MRC meant a realignment to the left. Indeed, the P√¥le r√©publicain was supposed to gather \\"the Republicans of the left and the right\\". Chev√®nement and the MRC supported the Socialist S√©gol√®ne Royal's candidacy in the 2007 presidential election, to prevent a new 21 April 2002 shock. The MRC fielded candidates in the 2007 French legislative election, including Chev√®nement in Territoire-de-Belfort, seat he had lost in 2002 to the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). He failed to win back his seat, but a former Gaullist of the left, Christian Hutin was elected in the Nord d√©partement. The party has one Senator, Chev√®nement, who sits in the European Democratic and Social Rally (RDSE) group, which is the most Europhile group. It also has 19 regional councillors and 8 general councillors. In the 2009 European Parliament election and the 2014 European Parliament election, the party did not run or support any list. Negotiations with the Socialist Party and the new Left Front failed. In October 2018, PS MEP Emmanuel Maurel and senator Marie-No√´lle Lienemann announced that they would leave the Socialists to ally with the MRC in a new party called \\"Gauche r√©publicaine et socialiste\\" (GRS).

Lepage claimed to stand for an independent and centrist green voice, as opposed to No√´l Mam√®re, candidate for the more left-wing Green Party. The party later refused to join the new centre-right Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). In 2007, after dropping out of the presidential race, Lepage endorsed Fran√ßois Bayrou's centrist candidacy and CAP21 ran around 20 candidates with Bayrou's new Democratic Movement in the subsequent legislative election. It failed to have any candidates elected. CAP 21 became an associate party of Bayrou's MoDem on June 15, 2008. Corinne Lepage became a high-ranking member of the MoDem's leadership, serving as a Vice President. In the 2009 European elections, Corinne Lepage was elected Member of the European Parliament for North-West France as the MoDem's top candidate in the region. However, the party split from the MoDem in the runup to the 2010 regional elections and pursued an alliance with Europe √âcologie.

He was the elder brother of Johann Krieger. Life=Early years A 1650 engraving of Nuremberg, home of the Krieger family. The Krieger brothers came from a Nuremberg family of rugmakers. According to Johann Mattheson's Grundlage einer Ehren-Pforte, Johann Philipp started studying keyboard playing at age 8, with Johann Drechsel (a pupil of the celebrated Johann Jakob Froberger) and other instruments at around the same time, with Gabriel Sch√ºtz. He was apparently a gifted student, displaying absolute pitch and a feeling for keyboard music: according to Mattheson, already after a year of studies he was able to impress large audiences and was composing attractive arias. Johann Philipp soon left Nuremberg for Copenhagen, where he spent some four or five years, studying organ playing with Johann Schr√∂der, the royal organist, and composition with Kaspar F√∂rster. The precise dates of his stay in Copenhagen are unknown: Mattheson reports 1665 to 1670, but Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr, author of a 1730 biographical volume on famous residents of Nuremberg, claimed Johann Philipp stayed in Copenhagen between 1663 and 1667. During his stay, whenever it occurred, Johann Philipp was offered an invitation to become organist in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway), which he declined. Mattheson and Doppelmayr also differ on the details of Johann Philipp's subsequent career. He and his brother evidently spent some time in Zeitz, studying composition, and also went to Bayreuth, where Johann Philipp became court organist, and then rose to the rank of Kapellmeister, Johann succeeding him as court organist. However, the precise dates are again unknown. Doppelmayr gives 1669‚Äì1670 for the Bayreuth stay, while Mattheson confusingly reports that Johann Philipp was at Zeitz in 1670‚Äì1671, and at Bayreuth in 1670‚Äì1672. Research has shown that the civic records of Zeitz contain no mention of either brother, and Bayreuth records list Johann Philipp as court organist in 1673, complicating the matter further. Journey to Italy and later life Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, under whom Krieger was promoted to Kapellmeister, and with whom the composer moved to Wei√üenfels. Johann Philipp was still employed in Bayreuth in 1673, when Margrave Christian Ernst left to fight in the Franco-Dutch War. Following that, the composer was granted permission to travel to Italy without loss of salary. He stayed in Venice, studying with Johann Rosenm√ºller (composition) and Giovanni Battista Volpe (keyboard), and then in Rome, where his teachers were Antonio Maria Abbatini (composition) and Bernardo Pasquini (keyboard and composition). In 1675 Johann Philipp went to Vienna, then one of the most important musical capitals of Europe, where he played for Emperor Leopold I. The Emperor was a well-known patron of the arts and a composer; upon hearing Krieger's performance, he was sufficiently impressed to ennoble him and all his brothers and sisters. Johann Philipp later returned to Bayreuth, and shortly thereafter travelled to Frankfurt and Kassel. He was offered job invitations in both cities, but either declined both, or held them for a very short time. On 2 November 1677 Johann Philipp was employed as court organist at Halle. Duke August died in 1680 and was succeeded by his brother, Johann Adolf I, who moved the court to Wei√üenfels. Johann Philipp went with him as Kapellmeister, and this was his last position: he held it for 45 years, until his death. The court's musical establishment soon became one of Germany‚Äôs greatest. Two years after Johann Philipp moved to Wei√üenfels, his brother Johann moved to Zittau, similarly to accept a position he would occupy for several decades until his death. Johann Philipp was a prolific composer and supplied the Wei√üenfels court with countless sacred and secular works, including some 2,000 cantatas, at least 18 operas, trio-sonatas, etc. He also had numerous works by other composers performed at the court, and kept a catalogue of every piece he performed. He actively published his own music: a set of trio sonatas appeared in 1688, to be followed by another, then a collection of music for wind instruments, etc. Unfortunately, numerous works were lost: for instance, of the 2,000 cantatas only 76 are extant. This is the case with his brother's music, too: hundreds of his compositions are listed in Johann Philipp's catalogue, but very few survive. Johann Philipp died in 1725. He was succeeded as Wei√üenfels Kapellmeister by his son, Johann Gotthilf, until 1736.

Chocolate agar is used for growing fastidious respiratory bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. In addition, some of these bacteria, most notably H. influenzae, need growth factors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (factor V or NAD) and hemin (factor X), which are inside red blood cells; thus, a prerequisite to growth for these bacteria is the presence of red blood cell lysates. The heat also inactivates enzymes which could otherwise degrade NAD. The agar is named for its color and contains no chocolate products.

The beyond) is a 1981 Italian Southern Gothic supernatural horror film directed by Lucio Fulci, and starring Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck. Its plot follows a woman who inherits a hotel in rural Louisiana that was once the site of a horrific murder, and which may be a gateway to hell. It is the second film in Fulci's \\"Gates of Hell\\" trilogy after City of the Living Dead (1980), and was followed by The House by the Cemetery (1981). Filmed on location in and around New Orleans in late 1980 with assistance from the Louisiana Film Commission, additional photography took place at De Paolis Studios in Rome. Released theatrically in Italy in the spring of 1981, The Beyond did not see a North American release until late 1983 through Aquarius Releasing, who released an alternate version of the film titled 7 Doors of Death; this version featured an entirely different musical score and ran several minutes shorter than Fulci's original cut. The original version of the film saw its first United States release in September 1998 through a distribution partnership between Rolling Thunder Pictures, Grindhouse Releasing and Cowboy Booking International. Following its release, reception of The Beyond was polarized. Contemporary and retrospective critics have praised the film for its surrealistic qualities, special effects, musical score and cinematography, but note its narrative inconsistencies; horror filmmakers and surrealists have interpreted these inconsistencies as intentionally disorienting, supplementing the atmospheric tone and direction. The Beyond is ranked among Fulci's most celebrated films, and has gained an international cult following over the ensuing decades. Plot At Louisiana's Seven Doors Hotel in 1927, a lynch mob murders an artist named Schweick, whom they believe to be a warlock. Schweick was in the middle of finishing a grotesque painting, which is seen as part of a seance and evidence of the mob's belief. Since Schweick was killed while the painting was being completed, this counts as a human sacrifice and one of the Seven Doors of Death opens, allowing the dead to cross into the world of the living. In 1981, Liza Merrill, a young woman from New York City, inherits the hotel and plans to re-open it. Her renovation work activates the hell portal, and she contends with increasingly strange incidents. Larry, a painter, falls off his rig after seeing a white-eyed woman and is badly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about her eyes. Dr. John McCabe arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. The bell for room 36 rings, and Liza dismisses it as malfunctioning. A plumber named Joe investigates flooding in the cellar and a demonic hand gouges out his eye. His body and another are later discovered by a hotel maid, Martha. Liza encounters a blind woman named Emily, who warns that reopening the hotel would be a mistake. Joe's wife Mary-Anne and their daughter Jill arrive at the hospital morgue to claim Joe's corpse. After tending to her late husband's corpse, Mary-Anne screams in terror which causes her to fall to the floor; Jill finds her mother lying on the floor unconscious, her face burned by acid that toppled over from the impact. As she tries to flee, Jill encounters a corpse coming back to life. Meanwhile, Liza meets with Dr. McCabe and they exchange their life stories over dinner. Liza admits her multiple failed careers, and how reopening the hotel will fulfill her hopes for success. McCabe talks about his experience as a doctor giving him a better grasp of reality, and led to his atheism. He then receives a phone call informing him of Mary-Anne's death. Later, Liza encounters Emily at the hotel. Emily tells Liza the story of Schweick, and warns her to not enter Room 36. The bell rings again, and Liza notes how terrified Emily becomes afterwards. When Emily examines Schweick's painting, she begins to bleed and flees the hotel. Liza attempts to go after Emily, but notices that her own footsteps are audible, while those of Emily and her guide dog Dicky are not. Liza ignores Emily's advice and investigates Room 36. She discovers an ancient book titled Eibon and sees Schweick's corpse nailed to the bathroom wall. She flees the room in terror, but is stopped by John. She takes him to Room 36, but both the corpse and the book are gone. Liza describes her fearful encounters with Emily, but John insists that Emily is not real. While in town, Liza spots a copy of Eibon in the window of a book store, but when she rushes in to grab it, a different book is in its place. The shop owner says the book has been there for years, prompting Liza to remark to John that perhaps it is all in her head. At the hotel, a worker named Arthur attempts to repair the same leak as Joe, but is killed off-screen by ghouls. Liza's friend Martin Avery visits the public library to find the hotel's blueprints, which reveal a large unknown space in the center. He becomes curious but is struck by a sudden force and falls from a ladder, resulting in paralysis. Spiders appear out of nowhere and swarm over his body, ravaging his face and killing him. Back at the hotel, Martha is cleaning the bathroom in Room 36 when Joe's animated corpse emerges from the bathtub. Joe pushes her head into one of the exposed nails where Schweick's corpse was earlier, killing her and gouging one of her eyes. Later, the walking corpses of Schweik, Joe, Mary-Anne, Martin and Arthur invade Emily's house due to her warning Liza about the impending doom. She orders them to leave her alone, and insists she will not return with Schweick. She commands Dicky to attack the corpses, and they are scared away. Dicky turns on Emily immediately after, tearing out her throat and ripping off her ear. At the hotel, spirits terrorize Liza while John breaks into Emily's house‚Äîwhich appears to have been abandoned for years‚Äîand finds Eibon. Liza suffers a mental breakdown when Arthur's corpse tries to kill her, and the bell rings when she tries to escape. John returns to the hotel and patronizes Liza, accusing her of placing the book in the house and making up everything to get to him. His final decision to disregard her fears is when he spitefully reads the book, and learns the hotel is a gateway to Hell. A sudden force roars and bleeds all over them, making them flee. Schweick's painting bleeds, and an unseen force says \\"And you will face the sea of darkness, and all therein that may be explored\\". The blood-soaked pair retreat to the hospital, which is empty. John tries to think of some logical answer for the events, but the hospital is suddenly overrun by ghouls. Liza is attacked by Larry's corpse, but John gets a gun out of his desk and they escape, only to become separated. Only Dr. Harris and Jill are found still alive, but Harris is killed by flying shards of glass. Liza, John and Jill try to flee, but are confronted by Schweick's corpse. No matter how many times he is shot by John, he continues his pursuit. Jill attacks Liza and is killed by John. Escaping the ghouls, John and Liza rush down a set of stairs but find themselves back in the basement of the hotel. John notes how impossible the entire ordeal is, but has no choice but to accept them to be real. They move forward through the flooded labyrinth and stumble into a supernatural wasteland‚Äîthe same landscape in Schweick's painting, which turns out to be Hell itself. No matter which direction they travel, they find themselves back at their starting point. They are ultimately blinded just like Emily, succumb to the darkness, and disappear. Cast * Catriona MacColl as Liza Merril * David Warbeck as Dr. John McCabe * Cinzia Monreale as Emily * Antoine Saint-John as Schweick ** Giovanni De Nava as Zombie Schweick * Veronica LazƒÉr as Martha * Larry Ray as Larry * Al Cliver as Dr. Harris * Michele Mirabella as Martin Avery * Gianpaolo Saccarola as Arthur * Maria Pia Marsala as Jill * Laura De Marchi as Mary-Anne * Tonino Pulci as Joe the Plumber * Lucio Fulci as Librarian Pictorialist interpretations and themes John Thonen of Cinefantastique wrote that The Beyond has \\"a story structure akin to that of an advanced fever dream\\". Film scholar Wheeler Dixon similarly wrote that the \\"slight framing narrative is merely the excuse for Fulci to stage a series of macabre, distressing set pieces\\". Writer Bill Gibron suggested that the film has a subtext of \\"slavery, witchcraft, mob justice‚Äîand perhaps the key to almost all Fulci narratives‚Äîrevenge\\" at its core. The concept of \\"the beyond\\", which the characters Liza and John enter in the films' final sequence, is interpreted by film writer Meagan Navarro as a statement on \\"the Catholic concept of purgatory\\". Fulci was a lapsed Catholic, and previous films of his, such as Don't Torture a Duckling (1972), had dealt with corruption among clergy. A prominent theme, according to film scholar Phillip L. Simpson, is that of blindness as a result of exposure to evil, specifically tied to the Book of Eibon: \\"The book, like many other (in)famous 'evil' books found in literature and cinema, is a physical, written record of valuable occult knowledge that attempts to codify‚Äîaccompanied by dire warnings that careless or ignorant deployment of that power will result in horrific consequences‚Äîwhat is otherwise usually represented as literally 'unseeable'.\\" Simpson interprets the film's \\"pervasive images of blindness and eye mutilation\\" as being directly consequential to characters' exposure to the book. Simpson points out that only Schweick, the warlock lynched in the film's 1927 prologue, and Emily, a \\"seeress who transcends temporality\\", possess the \\"necessary sight\\" to interpret the contents of the book. Production=Development and pre- production Producer Fabrizio De Angelis said that on his previous collaboration with Fulci, Zombi 2 (1979), they had aspired to make \\"a comic book movie... that is, instead of being scared, people would laugh when they saw these zombies\\". Instead, audiences largely responded with fear, prompting them to make a straightforward horror film. After making City of the Living Dead (1980), Fulci sought to make a follow-up film as part of a trilogy with the \\"Gates of Hell\\" being a unifying theme. Simpson describes the trilogy as being loosely \\"connected by the trope of hapless mortals literally living on top of an entrance to Hell and then inadvertently falling into it\\". The base concept for The Beyond was devised by Fulci, Giorgio Mariuzzo, and Dardano Sacchetti. A poster designed by Enzo Sciotti was produced based solely on the treatment in hopes of selling the film to international markets, and the film's title was chosen based on a conversation between Fulci and De Angellis. De Angelis recalled Fulci discussing the film's concept with him: \\"So he's telling me this story about a couple moving into a house, where underneath is hell. And I was like, 'What does this mean?'... there weren't any dead people, maybe killed... No, there was hell under that house!\\" And he said 'the beyond.' And when I heard 'The Beyond,' that was already the title.\\" After receiving De Angellis's approval, Fulci requested that Sacchetti begin writing a full screenplay based on the brief treatment they had completed. According to De Angellis, much of the plot was devised based on vague ideas Fulci had for various death scenes, as well as several key words that he felt unified his vision. Some elements of the screenplay were derived in an arbitrary manner, such as the design of the Eibon symbol, which Fulci based on the shape of a trivial amateur tattoo his daughter had gotten on her arm. Sacchetti's conception of the \\"beyond\\" was based on his own ruminations on death, and the \\"suffering of being born condemned to death... [of being] born to be erased\\". Sacchetti sought to depict the beyond as a hell full of dead souls, an otherworld existing \\"outside of Euclidean geometry\\". Originally, the film's final sequence in which the characters enter the \\"beyond\\" was meant to take place at an amusement park, where the two main characters, now dead, are able to enjoy themselves in a \\"great amusement park of life\\". Due to logistical restrictions, however, this was unable to be filmed, and the existing final sequence‚Äîin which the characters enter a vast desert landscape full of corpses‚Äîwas devised by Sacchetti \\"on the spur of the moment\\". In an interview, Fulci gave the film's budget as 580 million Italian lire, half the amount that De Angelis had originally allotted to it. Casting Although Fulci originally intended to cast Zombi 2 star Tisa Farrow as Liza Merrill, English actress Catriona MacColl was chosen after having worked with him previously on City of the Living Dead. She would go on to appear in the subsequent final film of Fulci's \\"Gates of Hell\\" trilogy, The House by the Cemetery, as well. MacColl would later deem The Beyond to be her personal favorite film of the trilogy, stating that she remains drawn to the \\"decadent Italian macabre poetry\\" that she feels the film exudes. David Warbeck was cast as Dr. John McCabe after he and Fulci became friends during the making of The Black Cat (1981). Originally, the roles of Joe the Plumber and Professor Harris were to be played by Venantino Venantini and Ivan Rassimov, respectively, but they were replaced by two of Fulci's friends, stage actor Tonino Pulci and Zombi 2 co-star Al Cliver, whom the director affectionately nicknamed \\"Tufus\\". Partway during the shoot, French actor Antoine Saint-John, who played the doomed painter Schweick, was replaced by Giovanni De Nava, who played the \\"zombified\\" version of the character; De Nava is sometimes mistakenly credited for playing Joe. For the role of the ghostly Emily, Stefania Casini was originally considered, but Casini turned down the role as she did not want to wear the blinding contact lenses she would have been required to wear. Fulci instead cast actress and model Cinzia Monreale, who had previously starred in his Spaghetti Western Silver Saddle (1978). Monreale was drawn to the film as she felt Fulci's concept was \\"well written and full of mystery,\\" and she had enjoyed her time working with him previously. Filming The majority of The Beyond was filmed on location in late 1980 in New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as the outlying cities of Metairie, Monroe, and Madisonville. Larry Ray, a New Orleans resident and member of the Louisiana Film Commission, was hired to help Fulci scout locations. While scouting, Fulci took a liking to Ray and hired him as a production manager and producer's assistant. Within New Orleans proper, filming was completed in the Vieux Carr√© district, as well as on the campus of Dillard University. The funeral sequence in the graveyard was shot at the Saint Louis Cemetery no. 1. The historic Otis House near Lake Pontchartrain, located within the Fairview-Riverside State Park, served as the Seven Doors Hotel. During filming, the production designers aged the home's exteriors by spraying the siding with water and dark dye, as well as throwing cement and sand on the floors to make it appear dusty and dilapidated. According to Ray, the sand damaged the original wood floors, and the production had to pay the State of Louisiana to restore them once filming wrapped. The sequence in which Liza meets Emily on the bridge was shot on the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, while Emily's house was the same New Orleans residence used in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby (1978). To achieve the film's stark visual style, cinematographer Sergio Salvati photographed the New Orleans exteriors using \\"warm colors\\" in hope of capturing the \\"sun, the heat, [and] the jazz\\" of the city. Salvati contrasted the urban New Orleans settings with the \\"cooler\\" interiors of the hotel, which often feature cool blue, orange, and violet lighting. According to Ray, Fulci had no official shooting script present while filming The Beyond, only a treatment that ran three pages in length: The majority of the cast were English speakers, while Fulci spoke Italian. Due to the language barrier, much of Fulci's direction was done with \\"miming, making faces and moving his body in order to make the actors understand what he wanted of them.\\" As he was a fluent Italian speaker, Ray served as Fulci's translator and interpreter throughout the shoot. After filming had completed in the United States, additional photography took place at De Paolis Studios in Rome, primarily consisting of the special effects- intensive scenes. Among these were the interior shots of the film's opening sequence featuring the mob murder, as well as interior replicas of Emily's home. Some additional sequences featuring Emily's dog were also shot in Rome, which required the production to find a lookalike German Shepherd in Italy. According to MacColl, the film's end sequence, in which she and Warbeck's characters enter \\"the beyond,\\" was completed on their last day of shooting, on 22 December 1980. The sequence was shot on an empty soundstage which had leftover sand from a previous film, and random civilians were hired off the street to appear as inanimate corpses lying in the sand. The sand was dampened with water, which, through evaporation, resulted in the natural fog effect present in the film. Special effects The white contact lenses worn by several of the actors (Cinzia Monreale pictured) completely blocked their vision. The special effects in The Beyond were achieved via practical methods, and have been noted by scholars as Fulci's \\"signature violent set pieces.\\" The majority of the special effects-intensive scenes were filmed on sound stages in Italy. Monreale recalled her time spent on set during the effects preparation as the most \\"intense,\\" due to elaborate setups and hours spent properly achieving Fulci's desired visual outcome. Among these for Monreale was her character's violent death sequence, in which she is viciously mauled by her dog. To achieve the effect, the head of a fake dog was crafted, as well as a layered prosthetic neck which the dog tears open with its teeth. This sequence alone took around three days to complete, with the dummy dog being manually puppeteered. On set, Fulci jokingly referred to the fake dog head as \\"Puppola.\\" The white contact lenses worn by several actors in the film were made of glass and hand-painted with multiple shades of white enamel. They were described by both MacColl and Warbeck as being very uncomfortable; MacColl recalled that after completing the film's finale sequence, both she and Warbeck had difficulty removing them from their eyes. The lenses also obscured the wearer's vision, rendering them completely or nearly-completely blind. Monreale expressed that wearing the lenses was extremely difficult for her; all of her scenes except one required her to wear them, and she had to rely on the film's makeup artist, Maurizio Trani, for assistance navigating the sets. To minimize discomfort, Trani would regularly remove the lenses from the actors' eyes and disinfect them between takes. One of the film's more elaborate special effects sequences was the death scene of Martin Avery, who is attacked by a horde of tarantula spiders. According to Trani, crafting the sequence was \\"complicated,\\" but \\"proved to be simpler than expected.\\" Special effects designer Giannetto DeRossi created half of a prosthetic mouth for the actor, Michele Mirabella, from latex and a dental cast he obtained from his dentist. While some of the spiders were real, the ones filmed biting at Avery's mouth and face were fake, and controlled with handheld clamps. Close- up shots of Mirabella's real mouth were intercut with ones of his false mouth (including close-ups of a fake tongue) as it is bitten by the spiders, resulting in a seamless image of the attack. The special effects during the film's first morgue scene in which a bottle of acid is poured over the face of Mary-Anne were created by effects artist Germano Natali. To achieve the melting effect of the face, real sulfuric acid was dumped over a cast of the actress's face, which was made of a mixture of wax and clay; sulfuric acid dissolves the latter substance. A similar dummy head was created to achieve the effect of the character of Joe's eyeball being gouged. The crucifixion of Schweick, shown in the opening sequence, was also achieved via practical methods: holes were cut for Saint-John to conceal his forearms behind the cross, while dummy forearms filled with fake blood reservoirs were attached to the front of the cross. Two additional holes were cut at the ends of the dummy forearms, through which DeRossi inserted his own hands. The result appears as two seamless arms, and allowed for the crucifixion to look authentic, as the hands were motile and could writhe in reaction. Trani's hands appear onscreen as the nailer who completes the crucifixion. Music Fulci commissioned composer Fabio Frizzi to complete a musical score for the film. Commenting on writing the score, Frizzi said: \\"The distinctive aim of the film's soundtrack was to achieve an old goal of mine. I wanted to combine two different instrumental forms I had always loved: the band and the orchestra. When I started writing music some years before, I had learned to combine these two sounds; but for many reasons, the roles of strings and wind instruments were mainly created by keyboards. This time I decided to get serious.\\" The score features various instruments, including Mellotron and bass, as well as orchestral and choral arrangements. Rolling Stone reviewers noted that as the film progresses toward its conclusion, \\"Frizzi's score also darkens, growing heavy, underlining the inescapable fate of the characters.\\" In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked Frizzi's score the 11th-best horror film score of all time. Chris Alexander of ComingSoon.net also ranked the film's main theme, \\"Voci Dal Nulla\\" (), one of the greatest horror film themes ever composed. In 1981, the score was released in Italy on vinyl through Beat Records Company. On October 30, 2015, the independent record label Death Waltz issued the remastered score on vinyl. A compact disc version had been released previously in 2001 by Dagored Records. Grindhouse Releasing now includes the soundtrack with the Blu-ray release in the USA. On October 17, 2019, Eibon Press announced that Grindhouse Releasing had discovered the original recordings of the score for the US 7 Doors of Death cut, and they had collaborated to release a limited- edition CD with a comic book adaptation of the film. Reception and legacy=Theatrical distribution The Beyond was released theatrically in Italy on 29 April 1981, where it grossed 747,615,662 lire on its initial run; film historian Roberto Curti described this as \\"OK business\\", noting that while this gross was less than that of several of Fulci's earlier horror films, the film was widely distributed in other countries, and was especially successful in Spain. In England, the film had difficulty with censors. The BBFC passed it with an X rating demanding several cuts and subsequently included it on the video nasties list. It would not be released in the United Kingdom uncut until 2001 on home video. In Germany, the film was released under the title Die Geisterstadt der Zombies (). The German theatrical version was the only version of the film in which the pre-credit sequence was printed in color; in the Italian and international versions, the sequence was printed in sepia. In the United States, the film was released and marketed under the title 7 Doors of Death The Beyond did not see a U.S. release until 1983, when it was acquired for theatrical distribution by Terry Levine of Aquarius Releasing, a New York City-based distributor who had previously handled regional distribution for John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). Levine purchased the U.S. distribution rights for around $35,000, and spent an additional $10,000 on additional post-production work, which included replacing Frizzi's music with a new score by Mitch and Ira Yuspeh, as well as truncating it by several minutes in order to achieve an R-rating. Aquarius released this alternate version of the film in the United States on 11 November 1983 under the title 7 Doors of Death. According to Levine, the title change was a result of his belief that the original title was too nebulous, and that the film's \\"Seven Doors\\" plot device was a more interesting narrative hook that would intrigue audiences. To promote this release, Levine screened the film for Kim Henkel and Tobe Hooper, the respective co-writer and director of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), who granted laudatory quotes about the film to be used in television and print advertisements. Most of the cast and crew names for this version were also \\"anglicised\\" to appeal to U.S. audiences, with Fulci being credited as \\"Louis Fuller\\". 7 Doors of Death was a commercial success, grossing $455,652 during its first week of release; Levine estimated that the film turned him a profit of roughly $700,000. The uncut version of The Beyond was not made commercially available in the U.S. until after Fulci's death in 1996. Following the director's passing, the North American distribution rights to the film were acquired by Bob Murawski and Sage Stallone for their company Grindhouse Releasing, which partnered with Quentin Tarantino and Jerry Martinez's Rolling Thunder Pictures and Noah Cowan's Cowboy Booking International to re-release the film through a series of midnight screenings that began in Los Angeles, New York City and five other locations on 12 June 1998, followed by a national roll-out. Remarking on Rolling Thunder's stake in the film, Cowboy Vice-President John Vanco noted that \\"Fulci is one of [Tarantino and Martinez's] favorite directors\\", and the pair \\"wanted to have someone with a little more kind of midnight movie specialized kind of background [to help distribute the film]\\". By July 26, the re-release had made $123,843 at the box office. Murawski's ownership of The Beyond's U.S. rights proved useful while editing Peter Parker's transformation scene in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002): due to a lack of money to create original footage, he inserted a brief close-up shot of a spider from Martin's death scene into the sequence, along with footage from Raimi's Darkman (1990). Grindhouse gave the film a second theatrical re-release in North America to celebrate its 24th anniversary, starting on 9 February 2015 at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Yonkers, New York, and ending on 27 March 2015 in the Music Box Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.  Critical response Contemporaneous= Upon the film's 1983 release in the United States as 7 Doors of Death, critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times deemed the film visually \\"elegant,\\" but noted: \\"as a thriller of the occult it's overly familiar, just another rotting-flesh ghoul parade.\\" Bill Kelley of the Sun-Sentinel similarly praised the film's visual elements, including the sepia prologue, but added: \\"The problem is, whenever someone in the film is trying to act, the camera is recording something that's really not worth seeing,\\" ultimately classing it as a \\"Z-grade horror movie.\\" The Akron Beacon Journals Bill O'Connor criticized the plot for a lack of coherence, writing: \\"People get killed all over the hotel. Then, after they're killed, they get ugly.. We never know why they get killed or why they get ugly, which leads me to suspect that maybe this is an art film. At the end of the movie, the dead walk... Then the people leave the movie theater. They look just like the dead people who walked out of the morgue. Maybe this is not an art movie. Maybe this is a documentary.\\" Tim Pulleine (The Monthly Film Bulletin) stated that the film allows for \\"two or three visually striking passages-and granting that, from Bava onwards, narrative concision has not been the strong suit for Italian horror movies‚Äîthe film is still completely undone by its wildly disorganized plot.\\" The review also critiqued the dub, noting its \\"sheer ineptitude\\". =Retrospective= Upon its 1998 re-release, critic Roger Ebert deemed it a film \\"filled with bad dialogue\\" and criticized it for having an incoherent plot. In 2000, he included the film in a book of his \\"most-hated\\" movies. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Beyond holds a 67% approval rating based on 21 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.46/10. AllMovie called the film a \\"surreal and bloody horror epic\\" and labeled it \\"Italian horror at its nightmarish extreme\\". Time Out London, alternatively, called it \\"a shamelessly artless horror movie whose senseless story‚Äîa girl inherits a spooky, seedy hotel which just happens to have one of the seven doors of Hell in its cellar‚Äîis merely an excuse for a poorly connected series of sadistic tableaux of torture and gore.\\" Critic John Kenneth Muir wrote in Horror Films of 1980s: \\"Fulci's films may be dread-filled excursions into surrealism and dream imagery, but in the real world, they don't hang together, and The Beyond is Exhibit A.\\" A similar sentiment is echoed by Bill Gibron of PopMatters, who wrote of the film in 2007: In the years since its release, The Beyond has acquired a cult following. Time Out London conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. , The Beyond placed at number 64 on their top 100 list. Film critic Steven Jay Schneider ranked the film number 71 in his book 101 Horror Movies You Must See Before You Die (2009). Home video On 10 October 2000, Grindhouse Releasing co-distributed the film in collaboration with Anchor Bay Entertainment on DVD in both a limited-edition tin-box set, and a standard DVD. Both releases featured the fully uncut 89-minute version of the film. There were only 20,000 limited-edition sets released for purchase. The limited-edition set was packaged in a tin box with alternative cover artwork, including an informative booklet on the film's production as well as various miniature poster replications. The same year, Diamond Entertainment released a DVD edition bearing the 7 Doors of Death, which in spite of its usage of the US release title, is uncut at 89 minutes and sourced from the film's laserdisc. A Blu-ray version of the film was released in Australia on 20 November 2013. Grindhouse Releasing, the film's North American distributor, released the film in 2015 on high-definition Blu-ray in the United States, featuring two Blu-ray discs as well as a CD soundtrack. The distributors also wanted to restore the \\"7 Doors\\" version, but the original print of this is assumed to be lost. As of 2019, the \\"7 Doors\\" alternative score prints were discovered, and are in the process of restoration. \\"7 Doors\\" trailers, TV spots and an interview with Aquarius owner Terry Levene explaining the \\"Americanization\\" process was included as special features instead. Levene also stated he's very content with the original version being praised and preserved, and admitted he only made the \\"7 Doors\\" version as a way to gain American interest. As of 2018, a cut version of the film available for streaming via Amazon Video under the 7 Doors of Death title runs approximately 84 minutes.

The game emphasises skill, agility and accuracy in shooting at the goal. Whilst football has been played informally on beaches for many years, the introduction of beach soccer was an attempt to codify rules for the game. This was done in 1992 by the founders of Beach Soccer Worldwide, a company set up to develop the sport and responsible for the majority of its tournaments to this day. This was a major foundation for what is now known as beach soccer and what has led to the sport rapidly growing in popularity. The irregularity of the soft-sand playing surface leads to a totally different style of play than is used in football, with a greater degree of improvisation. The compact field, much smaller than a normal football field, allows players to score from anywhere on the sand, leading to an average of sixty attempts at goal in a single game. With an average scoring rate of one goal every three or four minutes, around eleven goals are scored in total during an average game.  History = Foundation  Beach football ( or futebol de areia) started in Brazil, more precisely at Rio de Janeiro. In 1950 the first official tournament was created to unite neighborhood small tourneys that happened since 1940. After huge popularity it has grown to be an international game. The participation of internationally renowned players such as flamboyant Frenchman Eric Cantona, legendary Spanish strikers Michel and Julio Salinas and Brazilian stars such as Rom√°rio, J√∫nior and Zico has helped to expand television coverage to large audiences in over 170 countries worldwide. Beach soccer had been played recreationally all over the world for many years and in many different formats. In 1992 the laws of the game were envisioned and a pilot event was staged by the founding partners of BSWW in Los Angeles. By 1993, the first professional beach soccer competition was organized at Miami Beach, with teams from the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Italy taking part.  Growth  A beach soccer game at the 2006 Chicago Beach Soccer Invitational In April 1994 the first event to be covered by network television transmissions was held on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, and the city hosted the first Beach Soccer World Championship in 1995. The competition was won by the host nation, making Brazil the first-ever World Champions of Beach Soccer. The success of the tournament saw commercial interest begin to match developments on the field, and growing demand for the sport around the world gave rise to the Pro Beach Soccer Tour in 1996. The first Pro Beach Soccer Tour included a total of 60 games in two years across South America, Europe, Asia and the United States, attracting major names both on and off the field. Interest generated by the tour in Europe led to the creation of the European Pro Beach Soccer League in 1998, providing a solid infrastructure that would increase the professionalism of the spectacle on all levels. The EPBSL, now known as the Euro BS League, brought promoters together from across the continent and satisfied the demands of the media, sponsors and fans. Only four years on from its creation, the successful first step in the building of a legitimate worldwide competition structure for the sport of pro beach soccer had been taken. Behind the scenes key developments were also taking place, with the Beach Soccer Company relocating its headquarters to Europe, firstly to Monaco and then Barcelona, before becoming Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. in April 2000. One year later they would join forces with Octagon Koch Tavares, who had continued to organise the World Championships and events in South America, to form a single entity known as Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), with the aim of unifying all major Pro Beach Soccer tournaments in the world under the same structure and providing representation of the sport to major sponsors, the media and FIFA. The EPBSL was also flourishing, a nail-biting 2000 season was decided in the closing match of the final tournament when Spain beat Portugal in an intense encounter. The Americas League also took shape, with teams entered from North and South America, whilst the Pro Beach Soccer Tour extended its horizons to the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Mexico, Greece, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. FIFA became the global governing body of the sport in 2005, acknowledging BSWW's framework and organizing the first FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.  Recent years  The next four years would see this growth consolidated by further progress both on and off the field, with the EPBSL emerging as the strongest pro beach soccer competition in the world. By 2004, some seventeen nations had entered teams, with this number expected to rise to over twenty for the Euro BS League in 2005, contributing to vastly expanded television coverage of the series and unprecedented demand from promoters in more than seventy countries looking to stage events. Such interest has allowed BSWW to strike major sponsorship deals with international companies including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and MasterCard, who stepped up their involvement in 2004 and are now title sponsors of the Euro BS League. Recognition has also come from FIFA, who have cited BSWW as the major entity behind the creation and growth of Beach Soccer, forming a highly promising partnership that was in its full splendour seen in the 2005 world cup, held in Copacabana Beach, Brazil. France won the first world cup and the next year Brazil won it at the same venue. The World Cup has continued to flourish with the first held outside Brazil in 2008, and future World Cups spreading as far out as Tahiti in 2013 and Portugal in 2015 As of 2017, FIFA and the continental confederations do not host women's beach soccer tournaments. The Asian Beach Games, European Games and South American Beach Games also do not have women's beach soccer tournaments.  Rules  The rules of beach soccer are based on the Laws of the Game of association football, with several modifications.  Field  A beach soccer pitch. The dashed white lines are not marked on the pitch, and must be inferred by players and officials. A beach soccer field is a level sandy area considerably smaller than a regular football field. The field is cleared of pebbles and seashells, along with any other objects which could injure a player. The field is rectangular in shape, and the touch line is longer than the goal line. The field dimensions are: * Length: * Width: The penalty area is within 9 m (9.8 yards) of the goals, and is marked by a yellow flag situated in touch. Two red flags opposite each other are at the center of the field to represent the half-way line. The goals are slightly smaller than their standard association football counterparts, being from the ground to the bottom of the crossbar and in width between the inside of each upright.  Players  Each team consists of five players, including the goalkeeper and an unlimited number of substitutions, from a selection of three to five players. Throw-ins and kick-ins mean the pace and flow of the game are much faster than regular football. Shoes are not allowed; players must play in bare feet, although ankle guards are permitted. Goal clearances (the equivalent of a goal kick) are taken by the goalkeeper using their hands to throw the ball and a goal cannot be scored directly from these.  Match length  A game lasts thirty-six minutes, and is split up into three twelve-minute periods. Unlike association football, in professional matches the referee is not the sole arbiter of the end of a period. A separate timekeeping official controls the official game clock, which is stopped for stoppages in play, and typically counts down to zero, as in North American sports such as basketball and ice hockey. Draws are not permitted, with the game going into three minutes of extra time, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still on level terms after normal time. Unlike football, penalty kicks are directly decided by sudden death rules.  Referees and discipline  Beach soccer has two on-field referees who co-operatively referee the game. They are assisted by a third referee, who acts in a manner similar to football's fourth official and a timekeeper. As in football, yellow and red cards can be issued. Unlike in football, the team can then bring on a substitute to replace the dismissed player after two minutes. Similar to a power play in ice hockey, this period of numerical advantage ends early if the penalised team concedes a goal.  Free kicks and penalties  Free kicks are awarded for various fouls. All free kicks are direct free kicks which has to be taken by the player who was fouled, unless awarded for deliberate handling. The laws specify that all players apart from the opposing goalkeeper must clear a zone between the kicker and the goal. Because of this and the small playing area, all free kicks represent a good opportunity to score. Penalties are awarded for fouls within the penalty area.  Other major differences from football  A beach soccer ball * The ball is inflated to a lower pressure (0.4‚Äì0.6 atm, compared to 0.6‚Äì1.1 atm in football) * Instead of a throw-in, a team may choose to take a kick-in * Preventing an opponent doing a bicycle kick is a specific foul * Teams may not keep possession in their penalty area for more than four seconds  Main beach soccer tournaments  The following are main beach soccer competitions:  International  Game at the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup 2006 * FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup * Intercontinental Cup * BSWW Mundialito * Mundialito de Clubes * Persian Beach Soccer Cup  PRO/Amateur International  * The Beach Soccer Championships ‚Äì Oceanside, California ‚Äì USA * North American Sand Soccer Championships ‚Äì Virginia Beach, Virginia ‚Äì USA  Confederation  AFC (Asian Football Confederation): * AFC Beach Soccer Championship CAF (Confederation of African Football): * CAF Beach Soccer Championship CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football): * CONCACAF Beach Soccer Championship CONMEBOL (South American Football Confederation): * CONMEBOL Beach Soccer Championship OFC (Oceania Football Confederation): * OFC Beach Soccer Championship UEFA (Union of European Football Associations): * Euro Beach Soccer Cup * Euro Beach Soccer League * UEFA Beach Soccer Championship * BSWW Euro Winners Cup  See also  * Beach handball * Beach rugby * Beach volleyball * Footvolley * Futsal * Street football * Teqball ReferencesExternal links * Laws of the Game at FIFA * Beach Soccer Worldwide Category:Association football variants Category:Team sports Category:Sports originating in Brazil Soccer Category:Athletic sports Category:Ball games ","title":"Beach soccer"},{"id":"1864153","text":"Fluoride or fluorine deficiency is a disorder which may cause increased dental caries (or tooth decay, is the breakdown of dental tissues by the acidic products released by the \\"bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates.\\") and possibly osteoporosis (a bone disorder which leads to a decrease in bone mass, and an increase in bone fragility), due to a lack of fluoride in the diet. Common dietary sources of fluoride include tea, grape juice, wine, raisins, some seafoods, coffee, and tap water that has been fluoridated. The extent to which the condition truly exists, and its relationship to fluoride poisoning has given rise to some controversy. Fluorine is not considered to be an essential nutrient, but the importance of fluorides for preventing tooth decay is well-recognized, although the effect is predominantly topical. Prior to 1981, the effect of fluorides was thought to be largely systemic and preeruptive, requiring ingestion. Fluoride is considered essential in the development and maintenance of teeth by the American Dental Hygienists' Association. Fluoride is also essential as it incorporates into the teeth to form and harden teeth enamels so that the teeth are more acid resistant as well as more resistant to cavity forming bacteria. Caries-inhibiting effects of fluoride were first believed to have been seen in 1902 when fluoride in high concentrations was found to stain teeth and prevent tooth decay. Fluoride salts, particularly sodium fluoride (NaF), are used in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Symptoms such as fractured hips in the elderly or brittle and weak bones are caused due to fluorine deficiency in the body. Fluoride stimulates bone formation and increases bone density, however bone with excess fluoride content has an abnormal structure resulting in increased fragility. Thus fluoride therapy results in large increases in bone mineral density but the effect on fracture rates, while positive, is small. Disputes over the essentiality of fluorine date back to the 19th century, when fluorine was observed in teeth and bones.Meiers P. Fluoride Research in the 19th and early 20th century . Retrieved 2009-1-4. In 1973 a trial found reduced reproduction in mice fed fluorine-deficient diets, but a subsequent investigation determined that this was due to reduced iron absorption.  Role of fluoride  Fluoride has proven to be an essential element with preventative and protective properties. Fluoride is capable of combating and working against tooth decay and increases resistance to the \\"demineralisation of tooth enamel during attack by acidic bacterias\\". While essential for all individuals, it is significant for children, as when ingested, the fluoride is incorporated into their developing enamel. This in turn causes their teeth to become less prone to decay. Therefore, a relationship can be formulated, in that the more fluoride entering the body, the overall decline in the rate of decay.  Sources of fluoride  Fluorine is the 13th most aboundant element in the Earth's crust. The ionic form of fluorine is called fluoride. Fluoride is most commonly found as inorganic or organic fluorides such as naturally occurring calcium fluoride or synthetic sodium fluoride. There are a number of sources of fluoride, these include:  Water  In Australia fluoride occurs naturally within water supplies, at a concentration of approximately 0.1 mg/L. However, this number varies amongst different populations, as specific fluoridated communities exceed this amount, ranging from 0.6-1.0 mg/L of fluoride present. The process of incorporating more fluoride into water systems is an affordable mechanism that can provide many beneficial effects in the long term.  Dentrifices  Fluoride toothpaste came into production in the 1890s, after its benefits were investigated. This product has become available to most industrialised countries, and within Australia accounts for \\"90% of total toothpaste purchased\\".  Fluoride supplements  Fluoride supplements were first recognised and highly suggested by health professionals, in areas where the practice of fluoridating water was not accepted. Such mechanisms are recommended for individuals, primarily children (whom of which are at a greater risk of caries) in low-fluoride areas. Dietary recommendations The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for some minerals in 1997. Where there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) was used instead. AIs are typically matched to actual average consumption, with the assumption that there appears to be a need, and that need is met by what people consume. The current AI for women 19 years and older is 3.0 mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). The AI for men is 4.0 mg/day. The AI for children ages 1‚Äì18 increases from 0.7 to 3.0 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of fluoride the UL is 10 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women ages 18 and older the AI is set at 2.9 mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). For men the value is 3.4 mg/day. For children ages 1‚Äì17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.6 to 3.2 mg/day. These AIs are comparable to the U.S. AIs. The EFSA reviewed safety evidence and set an adult UL at 7.0 mg/day (lower for children).

The popularity of Buffet's work, as well as the level of media attention around his lifestyle, were quite high in the 1950s and 1960s. Although he kept on painting throughout his life, there was a certain decline in interest in his work in the last decades of the 20th century, especially so in France. This decline in popularity was partly influenced by his fall from grace with French art pundits, whose support and interest shifted away from figurative art. In the 21st century, there has been a renewed spike in interest in the work of Bernard Buffet. With some successful exhibitions in France and throughout the world.

Being part of the plateau, it is not technically a mountain, but appears that way to motorists crossing over it. It is frequently referenced as one of the most treacherous stretches of highway in the United States, especially in inclement weather. It rises to an elevation of around , with gradients of 6%. Description The section of I-24 known, tautologically, as Monteagle Mountain consists of a more than segment in Grundy and Marion counties that includes both the eastern and western escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau. I-24 also travels concurrently with U.S. Route 64 (US 64) through this section. I-24 crosses the plateau in its narrowest section, which appears as an hourglass shape on maps. Monteagle Mountain is best known for its eastern descent, but its western descent is also one of the most hazardous stretches of Interstate Highway as well. Compared to grades elsewhere, Monteagle's 4‚Äì6% grade over a period of several miles does not come close to the steepest. The route contains six lanes over the eastern escarpment, with the extra lane on the westbound side serving as a truck climbing lane, and four lanes over the western escarpment. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) has yet to construct a truck lane on the western descent. On the eastern descent of the plateau, the eastbound lanes contain a 6% grade over a length of about where the elevation drops , and is particularly hazardous to truckers. At the top of this downgrade is a truck inspection station, and this downgrade also contains two runaway truck ramps, which are on the left due to the terrain. The speed limit on the eastbound lanes reduces to and for trucks, while on the westbound lanes it reduces to , with no separate restrictions for trucks. The eastern downgrade of Monteagle Mountain also contains the third-widest median of any Interstate Highway, with the others being I-8 through the In-Ko-Pah grade in California and I-84 through the Cabbage Hill grade east of Pendleton, Oregon.. There is more than between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend the other, and are located on what was originally US 64\\\\. The western downgrade of Monteagle Mountain on I-24, while not considered as hazardous, contains many curves, including one \\"c-shaped\\" curve, protracted over a distance of almost . The eastbound and westbound lanes are also located very close together, and crossover crashes and crashes with Jersey barriers located in the median in some places are common on this stretch. This segment also features off-ramp approach-style lane dividers, in order to slow both motorists and truckers. The speed limit on the westbound lanes, of this stretch is and for trucks, while on the eastbound lanes it is , with no separate restrictions for trucks. The approximately on top of the mountain, which contains exits with US 41 and US 41A, is not hazardous, but maintains the speed limit. A rest area is located at the top of the western escarpment of Monteagle Mountain. East of the grade, the route passes through straight plains with slight banked curves as it enters Kimball and South Pittsburg. West of the grade, the route enters the relatively flat terrain of the Eastern Highland Rim.  Background  The mountain was part of the Cherokee homeland until 1817. The mountain was named \\"Eagle Mountain\\" by the Cherokee because of the great number of golden eagles that roosted and nested along its ridge line. In fact, in honor of those birds, for many years a golden eagle sat in the park in Monteagle until it was stolen as a school prank. It now sits in display at Tennessee Technological University. After the Cherokee were removed, the area was renamed \\"Moffit's Station\\" in May 1870 by John Moffat, a native of Glasgow, Scotland, with his wife and children. It would later become \\"Moffat Station\\" and still later, the city of Monteagle.  Route history = US Highways  US 41 was constructed across the mountain in 1923, which was then known as the Dixie Highway and State Route 2 (SR 2). It later became US 64, and was upgraded to a two-lane road with additional truck climbing lanes on both of the downgrades for a total of three lanes.  Interstate Highway era  I-24 was constructed across the mountain between 1962 and 1968 by grandfathering in and improving the original segment of US 64\\\\. The route on the western downgrade of the mountain was widened to four lanes, and the eastern downgrade with two westbound and one eastbound lane was connected to I-24 while the westbound lanes were constructed. Construction on the westbound lanes was completed in 1973, and the three original lanes of US 41 on the eastern downgrade were converted to the eastbound lanes of I-24. Beginning in April 1985, the eastbound lanes of I-24 on the eastern downgrade of Monteagle Mountain were extensively straightened and rebuilt, and the grades reduced. The project also added left shoulders and an additional runaway truck ramp. This work was completed in 1989, and the lanes were reopened on July 11 of that year in a ceremony officiated by then-governor Ned McWherter. The project experienced many setbacks including geological problems, which delayed the project, and the inspection station and additional runaway truck ramp were not planned. Originally targeted for completion in December 1987 at a cost of $17 million, the final cost was $29.5 million. During this time both directions of traffic were routed to the westbound lanes of I-24. After the project was completed, eastbound I-24 was reopened, this time with a new truck climbing lane. A truck station to allow for the adjustment of brakes opened in January 1992. After the safety improvements were completed, accidents in the eastbound lanes of this stretch dropped from 54 in 1983 to 3 in 1991. In popular culture *The song \\"The Legend\\", written by Jerry Reed as the title song for the film Smokey and the Bandit, describes the Bandit in a harrowing journey down the Monteagle Grade in 1963. *\\"Monteagle Mountain\\", a song sang by Johnny Cash written by Thomas Richard McGibony >for his 1990 album Boom Chicka Boom. The song is told from the point of view of a truck driver who nearly has an accident descending the eastern grade of the mountain.

In 1991 Restless and a number of Enigma Records titles were acquired by Bill Hein and Joe Regis and re-launched in Hollywood, California. In 1992, Restless acquired the Twin/Tone Records label and classic titles by such artists as The Replacements, Soul Asylum, The Jayhawks and Ween. This added to Restless' already substantial catalogue of titles by They Might Be Giants, The Cramps, The Dead Milkmen, Devo, The Flaming Lips, Stiff Little Fingers, T.S.O.L. among others. In 1993 Restless co-founded Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA) with Warner Brothers Music Group (WMG) to handle its distribution and certain titles released by Warner Bros., Elektra Records, Atlantic Records, their affiliates and Sub Pop Records. Sub Pop subsequently became a partner in the venture. Within 10 years, ADA went on to become the largest distributor of independent music in America.

Roca 4.57) Saint Methodius of Olympus (died c. 311) was a Christian bishop, ecclesiastical author and martyr today regarded as a Church Father. He is commemorated on June 20.  Life  Few reports have survived on the life of this first systematic opponent of Origen; even these short accounts present many difficulties. Eusebius does not mention him in his Church History, probably because he opposed various theories of Origen. We are indebted to Saint Jerome for the earliest accounts of him.De viris illustribus, chapter 83 According to him, Methodius was Bishop of Olympos in Lycia and afterwards Bishop of Tyre. No later Greek author knows anything of his being Bishop of Tyre; and according to Eusebius,Historia Ecclesiastica, VIII, xiii. Tyrannio was Bishop of Tyre during the persecutions of Diocletian and died a martyr; after the persecution Paulinus was elected bishop of the city. Later sources make him bishop not of Olympos but of Patara, also in Lycia. It has been conjecture that he could have held both sees simultaneously, but this is unlikely.G. S., \\"Methodius\\", in W. Smith and H. Wace, eds., A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines During the First Eight Centuries (London, 1882), vol. III, p. 909. Jerome further states that Methodius suffered martyrdom at the end of the last persecution, i.e., under Maximinus Daia (311). Although he then adds, \\"that some assert\\", that this may have happened under Decius and Valerian at Chalcis, this statement (ut alii affirmant), adduced even by him as uncertain, is unlikely. Various attempts have been made to clear up the error concerning the mention of Tyre as a subsequent bishopric of Methodius; it is possible that he was transported to Tyre during the persecution and died there.  Works  Methodius had a comprehensive philosophical education, and was an important theologian as well as a prolific and polished author. Chronologically, his works can only be assigned in a general way to the end of the third and the beginning of the 4th century. He became of special importance in the history of theological literature, in that he combated various views of the great Alexandrian, Origen. He particularly attacked his doctrine that man's body at the resurrection is not the same body as he had in life, as well as his idea of the world's eternity. Nevertheless, he recognized the great services of Origen in ecclesiastical theology. Like Origen, he is strongly influenced by Plato's philosophy, and uses to a great extent the allegorical explanation of Scripture. Of his numerous works only one has come down to us complete in a Greek text: the dialogue on virginity, under the title Symposium, or on Virginity (Symposion e peri hagneias).In Patrologia Graeca, XVIII, 27-220. In the dialogue, composed with reference to Plato's Symposium, he depicts a festive meal of ten virgins in the garden of Arete, at which each of the participators extols Christian virginity and its sublime excellence. It concludes with a hymn on Jesus as the Bridegroom of the Church. Larger fragments are preserved of several other writings in Greek; we know of other works from old versions in Slavonic, though some are abbreviated. The following works are in the form of dialogue: #On Free Will (peri tou autexousiou), an important treatise attacking the Gnostic view of the origin of evil and in proof of the freedom of the human will # On the Resurrection (Aglaophon e peri tes anastaseos), in which the doctrine that the same body that man has in life will be awakened to incorruptibility at the resurrection is specially put forward in opposition to Origen. While large portions of the original Greek text of both these writings are preserved, we have only Slavonic versions of the four following shorter treatises: #De vita, on life and rational action, which exhorts in particular to contentedness in this life and to the hope of the life to come # De cibis, on the Jewish dietary laws, and on the young cow, which is mentioned in Leviticus, with allegorical explanation of the Old Testament food-legislation and the red cow (Num., xix) #De lepra, on leprosy, to Sistelius, a dialogue between Eubulius (Methodius) and Sistelius on the mystic sense of the Old Testament references to lepers (Lev., xiii) # De sanguisuga, on the leech in Proverbs (Prov., xxx, 15 sq.) and on the text, \\"the heavens show forth the glory of God\\" (Ps. xviii, 2). Of other writings, no longer extant, Jerome mentions (loc. cit.) a voluminous work against Porphyry, the Neoplatonist who had published a book against Christianity; a treatise on the Pythonissa directed against Origen, commentaries on Genesis and the Canticle of Canticles. Other authors attributed a work On the Martyrs, and a dialogue Xenon to Methodius; in the latter he opposes the doctrine of Origen on the eternity of the world. Gregory Abu'l Faraj attribute to Methodius some kind of work dealing with the patriarchs. The 7th-century Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius is falsely attributed to him. His feast day is September 18. Among the editions of his works are: P.G., XVIII; Jahn, S. Methodii opera et S. Methodius platonizans (Halle, 1865); Bonwetsch, Methodius von Olympus: I, Schriften (Leipzig, 1891). Six brief points summarize his contribution concerning Revelation: # Woman of Revelation 12 is the Church; the Child Represents the Saints. # 1260 Days Precede New Dispensation. # New Earth Follows Present Earth. # Contends Against Origen on the Resurrection. # Change of World to More Glorious Condition After the Conflagration. # Bodies Received in the Resurrection Never Die.  Doctrines = Virginity of Jesus Christ  Methodius taught that Jesus Christ remained a virgin His whole life as an example for men: > \\"What then did the Lord, the Truth and the Light, accomplish on coming down > to the world? He preserved His flesh incorrupt in virginity with which he > had adorned it. And so let us too, if we are to come to the likeness of God, > endeavor to aspire to the virginity of Christ.\\" (Symposium 1.5)  Notes  *  Further reading  * Katharina Bracht (ed.), Methodius of Olympus: State of the Art and New Perspectives, Berlin, Walter de Gruyter, 2017. * Patterson, L.

In Ketu, the ancestors of the Gbe- speaking peoples separated themselves from other refugees and began to establish their own identity.

He has also worked with Industrial Light and Magic on films including Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace and Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones. The Federation battleships and podracers are some of Belleci's pieces. Early life Belleci has a long history of working with fire and explosives. At an early age, his father showed him how to make a Molotov cocktail. Later, he accidentally lit part of his house on fire with a homemade flamethrower. When he was 19, he was nearly arrested for setting off a homemade pipe bomb near his parents' home in Seaside, California. The officer encouraged young Belleci to find a way of expressing his love for explosions and special effects that did not involve getting arrested. Belleci was raised and is a devout Christian. Career=Early work In 1994, after graduating from San Francisco State University's film school, he started working with Jamie Hyneman at M5 Industries. Belleci worked as a stage manager, running errands and cleaning the shop, but quickly moved up the ranks. A few years later, he started work at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM). Belleci worked for ILM for eight years as a model builder, sculptor, and painter. Belleci began work on Discovery Channel's MythBusters, in 2003, doing work behind the scenes and, in the second season, was featured as part of the show's build team. In the show's third season, he received on-screen credit. In 2005, Belleci persuaded fellow ILM veteran Grant Imahara to join the show, following the departure of original cast member Scottie Chapman. Belleci worked on: the Matrix trilogy, Van Helsing, Peter Pan, Starship Troopers, Galaxy Quest and Bicentennial Man. One of his short films, SandTrooper, has appeared on Syfy and in the Slamdance Film Festival. MythBusters Belleci is often considered by fellow MythBusters Kari Byron and Grant Imahara to be more of a daredevil and, as such, often performs the more dangerous stunts when testing a myth. These have included: testing the \\"Red Flag to a Bull\\" myth; testing the myth that a human's tongue will instantly stick to a frozen pole, in the \\"Snow Special\\" episode; and the myth \\"can you stay underwater for an hour while breathing through a dart tube?\\", in the \\"Ninja Movie Myths 2\\" episode. One of his more popular stunts, shown several times on the show, was an attempt to jump over a toy wagon on a bicycle; the attempt failed, resulting in Belleci flipping forward and landing on his face. The bike almost hit Belleci's head. As a result of doing these stunts, he is often involved in comical accidents while testing myths. According to the October 28, 2012, episode of MythBusters, he suffers from acrophobia. During the \\"Hollywood Hang\\" sequence, of the 2010 episode \\"Soda Cup Killer\\", Belleci fell off a roof, and despite being strapped into a safety harness system, landed in an open window ledge below the drop point, and hurt his leg causing substantial bleeding. He and Byron made a guest appearance on the October 3, 2012, episode of the Discovery series Sons of Guns. They test-fired some of the weapons in the Red Jacket shop and watched as the staff re-tested a myth previously busted by the Build Team: that a propane tank could explode if struck by a bullet. On August 21, 2014, it was announced that Belleci, along with co-stars Byron and Imahara, would be leaving MythBusters. Other work From 2011 to 2013, he co-hosted Punkin Chunkin on the Science Channel with fellow MythBusters build team members Kari Byron and Grant Imahara. In 2013 Belleci created a YouTube channel entitled Blow It Up, where he and various guests use explosives to blow up everyday items. In 2015, Byron and Belleci hosted Thrill Factor, a new show for the Travel Channel. In this show they visit and showcase thrill rides around the world and explore a little bit of science such as the effect of G forces on breathing, heart rate and other factors. Belleci stars alongside Imahara and Byron in the Netflix show White Rabbit Project which premiered on December 9, 2016. Belleci will star alongside Richard Hammond (Top Gear, The Grand Tour) for an untitled Amazon Video series announced in August 2019 to be produced by Hammond's Chimp Productions. The six-episode series will strand the two on a deserted island via shipwreck, and the two will use available resources to build out the means to survive on the island. Personal life From June 5‚Äì11, 2014, Belleci competed with electronic dance music producer deadmau5 in the Gumball 3000 race riding co-pilot in deadmau5's Ferrari 458 Spider named Purrari from Miami to Ibiza, Spain, and won top honors taking away the \\"Spirit of the Gumball\\" award. On December 24, 2018 Belleci proposed to his long-time girlfriend, Erin B. Humanitarian work During MythBusters' 2010 break, Belleci volunteered time to visit Haiti. He visited orphanages and installed clean water systems with \\"Life Giving Force,\\" a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing clean water to communities in need. He communicated that the trip has had a profound effect on him and that he admires the resilience of the Haitian people.

Archidioecesis Bambergensis) is a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church in Bavaria and is one of 27 Roman Catholic dioceses in Germany. About a third2006_Kirchenprovinzen.xls (actually 38.1% in 2006) of the population is Catholic. With 15.6% this diocese has one of higher (relative) numbers of worshippers on Sunday in Germany. It comprises the majority of the administrative regions of Upper Franconia and Middle Franconia, as well as a small part of Lower Franconia and the Upper Palatinate. Its seat is Bamberg. The dioceses of Speyer, Eichst√§tt, and W√ºrzburg are subordinate to it. The Diocese was founded in 1007 out of parts of the dioceses of Eichst√§tt and W√ºrzburg. In 1817, the diocese was raised to an archdiocese.  History  Bamberg Cathedral On 1 November 1007, a synod was held in Frankfurt. Eight archbishops and twenty-seven bishops were present at the synod as well as the German King Henry II. Henry II intended to create a new diocese that would aid in the final conquest of paganism in the area around Bamberg. But the territory of the Wends on the upper Main, the Wiesent, and the Aisch had belonged to the Diocese of W√ºrzburg since the organization of the Middle German bishoprics by St. Boniface, so that no new diocese could be erected without the consent of the occupant of that see. The bishop of W√ºrzburg raised no objection to parting with some of his territory, especially as the king promised to have W√ºrzburg raised to an archbishopric and to give him an equivalent in Meiningen. The consent of Pope John XVII was obtained for this arrangement, but the elevation of W√ºrzburg to an archbishopric proved impracticable, and its bishop withdrew his consent. At the synod, Henry obtained permission for the foundation of the diocese of Bamberg from parts of the dioceses of W√ºrzburg and Eichst√§tt. Bamberg was made directly subordinate to Rome. It was also decided that Eberhard, the king's chancellor, would be ordained by the archbishop of Mainz, Willigis, to be the head of the new border area diocese. The new diocese had expensive gifts at the synod confirmed by documents, in order to place it on a solid foundation. Henry wanted the celebrated monkish rigour and studiousness of the Hildesheim cathedral chapter ‚Äì Henry himself was educated there ‚Äì linked together with the churches under his control, including his favourite diocese of Bamberg. The next seven bishops were named by the emperors, after which free canonical election was the rule. Eberhard's immediate successor, Suidger of Morsleben, became pope in 1046 as Clement II. He was the only pope to be interred north of the Alps in the Bamberg Cathedral. In the thirteenth century, the diocese gradually became a territorial principality, and its bishops took secular precedence next after the archbishops; Bishop Henry I was the first prince- bishop. The fortieth bishop, George III of Limburg (1505‚Äì22), was inclined toward the Reformation, which caused a violent social outbreak under his successor Weigand (1522‚Äì56), and the city suffered severely in the Margraves' War (1552‚Äì54), as well as in the Thirty Years' War, when it was placed under the jurisdiction of Bernard, the new Duke of Franconia. At the Peace of Westphalia (1648), the bishops recovered their possessions. In 1802, in the course of the German mediatization, the prince-bishopric was secularized and its territory annexed to Bavaria. From 1808 to 1817 the diocese was vacant; but by the Bavarian Concordat of the latter year it was made an archbishopric, with W√ºrzburg, Speyer, and Eichst√§dt as suffragan sees.

The archdiocese covers an area of , encompassing Staffordshire, the West Midlands, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and much of Oxfordshire as well as Caversham in Berkshire. The metropolitan see is in the City of Birmingham at the Metropolitan Cathedral Church of Saint Chad. The metropolitan province includes the suffragan dioceses of Clifton and Shrewsbury. The Archbishop is Bernard Longley, who was named the ninth Archbishop of Birmingham on 1 October 2009. He succeeds the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols (2000-09). Bishop Longley was installed as Archbishop of Birmingham at the Metropolitan Cathedral and Basilica of Saint Chad on 8 December 2009, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception and one of the patronal feasts of the Archdiocese, St Chad being the other. History Erected as the Vicariate Apostolic of the Midlands District in 1688, the vicariate grew very slowly until the advent of the industrial revolution. In response to large growth the name was changed in 1840 to the Vicariate Apostolic of Central District and a new vicariate created out of the eastern district. Finally, in September 1850, the vicariate was elevated to a full diocese, as the Diocese of Birmingham, along with the Diocese of Nottingham and the Diocese of Shrewsbury. The diocese was then suffragan to the Archdiocese of Westminster. The Diocese of Birmingham was elevated to archdiocese status on 28 October 1911.

Background and education  Following graduation from Stanford University, Golden moved to Los Angeles and created a number of large, well received murals in the Los Angeles beach areas, particularly in Santa Monica, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was co-founder and director of the Los Angeles Public Art Foundation.https://web.archive.org/web/20010825181924/http://www.whyy.org/tv12/mural/golden_bio.html In 1985, following a diagnosis of lupus, Golden left California to be with her family in the Philadelphia area, where she had grown up. In 1984, she founded Mural Arts Philadelphia, which grew out of a short-term anti-graffiti campaign. The program was designed to fight graffiti in the city by giving graffiti artists a more productive artistic outlet. She quickly began working with at risk teens. Together, they painted murals throughout the city and were trained in practical working skills. The program grew, and the Mural Arts Program has now created over 3600 murals to date. In 2003, Golden received a Visionary Woman Award from Moore College of Art & Design. Eisenhower Fellowships selected Jane Golden as a USA Eisenhower Fellow in 2003. She is an instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. Supporters of Golden urged her to run for Mayor of Philadelphia in 2015, an idea Golden said she was \\"intrigued by.http://articles.philly.com/2012-07-09/news/32589478_1_mayoral-election- mural-arts-program-public-art  Art and community initiatives  Golden has become an important voice and organizer within the community. Under her leadership, the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program actively engages with critical issues in the area. Their Porch Light program spotlights mental illness issues and homelessness and addiction, in cooperation with the Department of Behavioral Health. Golden has taught at Graterford Prison for many years and has also spearheaded a collaborative project connecting inmates and juveniles at a correction facility with a Kensington neighborhood. Connections at Graterford brought Golden to a position where she could support conceptual artist Peggy Diggs, who worked with inmates to construct shelters for disaster survivors. Some bemoan the quality of the murals developed through local participation as a model for developing the murals, citing uneven quality, artist Stephen Powers identifies Golden's success in convincing civic authorities that art can be an agent of positive change. In 1989, Golden painted a mural in the Point Breeze section of Philadelphia with a group of neighborhood children titled \\"Stop the Violence\\", in honor of children from that neighborhood that had been killed by gun violence. In 2018, this mural was destroyed when the wall of the rowhome that contained it crumbled during the process of redevelopment, sparking controversy about the effects of gentrification in that neighborhood.

The Metropolitan Province of Cardiff Wales and Herefordshire therefore covers all of Wales and part of England. Cardiff's suffragan dioceses are the Diocese of Menevia and the Diocese of Wrexham. History The origin of the modern diocese can be traced to 1840 when the Apostolic Vicariate of the Welsh District was created out the Western District of England and Wales. The Welsh District consisted the whole of Wales and the county of Herefordshire. When Pope Pius IX judged that the time was right to re-establish the Catholic hierarchy in Wales and England in 1850. The southern half of the Welsh District became the Diocese of Newport and Menevia and was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Birmingham. It had its pro-cathedral at Belmont Abbey. In 1895, boundaries were redrawn, and the territory covering Glamorgan, Monmouthshire and Herefordshire was named the Diocese of Newport. Finally, in 1916, without further adjustment of boundaries, the territory was raised to the status of an archdiocese, and given the title Archdiocese of Cardiff.

The Archdiocese of Glasgow was one of the thirteen (after 1633 fourteen) dioceses of the Scottish church. It was the second largest diocese in the Kingdom of Scotland, including Clydesdale, Teviotdale, parts of Tweeddale, Liddesdale, Annandale, Nithsdale, Cunninghame, Kyle, and Strathgryfe, as well as Lennox, Carrick and the part of Galloway known as Desnes. Glasgow became an archbishopric in 1492, eventually securing the dioceses of Galloway, Argyll and the Isles as suffragans. The Scottish church broke its allegiance to Rome in 1560, but bishops continued intermittently until 1689.  History  The diocese of Glasgow became important in the 12th century. It was organized by King David I of Scotland and John, Bishop of Glasgow. There had been an earlier religious site the exact age of which is unknown. According to doubtful hagiographical tradition, this ecclesiastical site had been established by Saint Kentigern. The bishopric became one of the largest and wealthiest in the Kingdom of Scotland, bringing wealth and status to the town. Somewhere between 1175 and 1178 this position was strengthened even further when Bishop Jocelin obtained for the episcopal settlement the status of burgh from King William the Lion, allowing the settlement to expand with the benefits of trading monopolies and other legal guarantees. Sometime between 1189 and 1195 this status was supplemented by an annual fair, which survives to this day as the Glasgow Fair. Until 1560, when practice of the Catholic Faith was suppressed by act of the Parliament of Scotland, nearly all the bishops of Glasgow took an active share in the government of the country; whether as chancellors or treasurers of the kingdom or as members of regency during the minority of a sovereign. Robert Wishart (consecrated 1272, d. 1316) was conspicuous for his patriotism during the Scottish War of Independence from England, and was the close friend of William Wallace and Robert Bruce. William Turnbull (consecrated 1447, d. 1454), obtained in 1450 from Pope Nicholas V the charter of foundation for the University of Glasgow. On 9 January 1492, Pope Innocent VIII raised the see to metropolitan rank, attaching to it the suffragan dioceses of Argyle, Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Galloway. James Beaton, nephew of the celebrated Cardinal David Beaton, was the fourth and last archbishop of the old hierarchy. In 1560, eight years after his nomination, he was forced to retire to France, where he acted as confidential agent of Mary, Queen of Scots, and later openly as ambassador for James VI, till his death in Paris, 25 April 1603. He carried away with him the diocesan records, two of which deserve special mention: (1) \\"Registrum Vetus Ecclesiae Cathedralis Glasguensis\\", in handwriting of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and (2) \\"Liber Ruber Ecclesiae Glasguensis\\", with entries from about 1400 to 1476. These, along with other records, were in 1843 printed in a volume for the Maitland Club under the title: \\"Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis: Munimenta Ecclesiae Metropolitanae Glasguensis a sede restaurat√¢ saeculo ineunte XII ad reformatam religionem\\". A more splendid memorial of those times still remains in the old cathedral of St. Mungo, which was begun by Bishop Jocelyn (consecrated 1175, d. 1199) and received its last additions from Archbishop Blackader (consecr. 1484, d. 1508). Bishops and archbishopsResurrections In 1828, as part of the Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy, the Holy See erected the Western District or Vicariate of Scotland, and the first vicar Apostolic to reside in Glasgow was Andrew Scott, Bishop of Eretria (b. 1772, d, 1846). He was succeeded by John Murdoch, Bishop of Castabala (b. 1796, d. 1865) and John Gray, Bishop of Hypsopolis (b. 1817, d. 1872). On the resignation of Bishop Gray in 1869 Charles Petre Eyre (b. 1817, d. 1902) was consecrated Archbishop of Anazarba and appointed administrator Apostolic. On the Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy by Pope Leo XIII, 4 March 1878, the Archbishopric of Glasgow was re-established, and Archbishop Eyre was transferred to the restored see.

She was also a physician and one of the first ordained female Methodist ministers in the United States. Early life Carrie Chapman Catt and Anna Howard Shaw in 1917 Shaw was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1847. When she was four, she and her family emigrated to the United States and settled in Lawrence, Massachusetts. When Shaw was twelve years old, her father took \\"up claim of three hundred and sixty acres of land in the wilderness\\" of northern Michigan \\"and sent [her] mother and five young children to live there alone.\\"Shaw, Anna Howard; Jordan, Elizabeth Garver and Catt, Carrie Chapman (1915) The Story of a Pioneer, New York and London: Harper & Brothers.\\" Her mother had envisioned their Michigan home to be ‚Äúan English farm‚Äù with ‚Äúdeep meadows, sunny skies and daisies,\\" but was devastated upon their arrival to discover that it was actually a \\"forlorn and desolate\\" log cabin \\"in what was then a wilderness, 40 miles from a post office and 100 miles from a railroad.\\" Here the family faced the dangers of living on the frontier. Shaw became very active during this period, helping her siblings refurbish their home and supporting her mother in her time of shock and despair. Shaw took on several physical tasks such as \\"digging of a well, chopp[ing] wood for the big fireplace, [and] fell[ing] trees.\\" Seeing her mother's emotional suffering, Shaw blamed her irresponsible father for \\"ha[ving] g[iven] no thought to the manner in which [their family was] to make the struggle and survive the hardships before [them].\\" While her invalid mother was overburdened with household chores\\", her father in Lawrence could freely dedicate \\"much time to the Abolition cause and big public movements of his day.\\" The family's misfortunes grew worse over the years. During the Civil War, her sister Eleanor died giving birth, and her brother Tom was wounded. When Shaw was fifteen, she became a school teacher and, after her older brothers and father joined the war effort, she used her earnings to help support her family. Yet with \\"every month of effort, the gulf between income and expenses grew wider.\\" Call to preach Shaw felt a call to preach from an early age. As a child, she would spend time in the woods near her house, and stand on tree stumps to preach to the forest. She was determined to go to college and follow the path that she felt was God's will for her life. Despite her family's disapproval, as Shaw matured, her drive to attend college became firmer. After the Civil War, she abandoned her teaching job and moved in with her married sister Mary in Big Rapids, Michigan. While she recalls that she would have preferred more physical and active labor, such as digging ditches or shoveling coal, she was forced to pick up the \\"dreaded needle,\\" and become a seamstress, one of the more acceptable occupations available for women at the time. A pivotal moment in Shaw's life came when she met Reverend Marianna Thompson, a Universalist minister who came to preach in Grand Rapids. Shaw went to the service, eager to see a woman in the pulpit. After the service, Shaw confided in Thompson her own desire to pursue the ministry as a vocation, and Thompson strongly encouraged her to obtain an education without delay. Thanks to Thompson's help, Shaw entered Big Rapids High School where the preceptress, Lucy Foot, recognized Shaw's talents and drive. At the age of twenty-four, Shaw was invited by Dr. H. C. Peck, a man looking to ordain a woman into ministry in the Methodist Episcopal Church, to give her first sermon. Shaw hesitated at first because her only previous experience had been \\"as a little girl preaching alone in the forest...to a congregation of listening trees.\\" With encouragement from Lucy Foot, Dr. Peck, and her close friend, Clara Osborn, Shaw agreed and gave her first sermon in Ashton, Michigan. Despite the success of her first sermon, her new found passion to preach received disapproval from her classmates, friends, and family who agreed to pay for her college education only if she abandoned preaching. Despite such continual opposition and isolation from so many, Anna chose to keep on preaching. She was \\"deeply moved\\" by Mary A. Livermore, a prominent lecturer who came to Big Rapids. Ms. Livermore gave her the following advice: ‚Äúif you want to preach, go on and preach‚Ä¶No matter what people say, don‚Äôt let them stop you!‚Äù In 1873, the Methodist Church ‚Äúvoted unanimously to grant her a local preacher‚Äôs license.‚Äù Struggles during college years In 1873, Shaw entered Albion College, a Methodist school in Albion, Michigan. Since her family frowned upon her decided career path, they refused to provide any financial support. At that point, Shaw had been a licensed preacher for three years and earned her wages by giving lectures on temperance. After Albion College, Shaw attended Boston University School of Theology in 1876. She was the only woman in her class of forty-two men, and she always felt \\"the abysmal conviction that [she] was not really wanted there.\\" This attitude was furthered by her difficulty supporting herself financially. Already running on a tight income, Shaw found it unfair that the \\"male licensed preachers were given free accommodations in the dormitory and their board cost each of them $1.25 while it cost her $2 to pay rent of a room outside.\\" Additionally, she had trouble finding employment. Unlike in Albion where she was \\"practically the only licensed preacher available\\", at Boston University there were many preachers who she had to compete with. As she lost money to pay the rent, she struggled to feed herself and felt \\"cold, hunger, and lonel[y].\\" Now Shaw started to question whether the ministerial profession was meant for her. In the face of these hardships, Shaw continued on. In 1880, after she and Annie Oliver were refused ordination by the Methodist Episcopal Church, despite passing with the top exam score that year, she achieved ordination in the Methodist Protestant Church. Following her ordination, Shaw received an MD from Boston University in 1886. During her time in medical school, she became an outspoken advocate of political rights for women.

Joint effort with Susan B. Anthony Beginning in 1886, Shaw served as the chair of the Franchise Department of Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Her task was \\"to work for woman suffrage and then to use the ballot to gain 'home protection' and temperance legislation.\\"Bilhartz, Terry D. \\"Anna Howard Shaw.\\" Great Lives from History: The Nineteenth Century. Ed. John Powell. 4 vols. Salem Press, 2007. Salem History Web. September 26, 2011. However her focus on temperance subsided as she became more heavily involved in the suffrage movement by lecturing for the Massachusetts Suffrage Association and later the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Rev. Anna Shaw, 1894 Anna Howard Shaw, 1895 Shaw first met Susan B. Anthony in 1887. In 1888, Shaw attended the first meeting of the International Council of Women. Susan B. Anthony encouraged her to join the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). Having agreed, Shaw played a key role when the two suffrage associations merged when she \\"helped to persuade the AWSA to merge with Anthony's and Elizabeth Cady Stanton's NWSA, creating for the first time in two decades a semblance of organizational unity within the [suffrage] movement.\\" Beginning in 1904 and for the next eleven years, Shaw was the president of NAWSA. Under her leadership, NAWSA continued to \\"lobby for a national constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote.\\" Resignation from NAWSA presidency Anna Howard Shaw, 1914 During the early 20th century, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, NAWSA members, began employing militant techniques (e.g. picketing the White House during World War I) to fight for women's suffrage. They, like other members, were inspired by the success of the militant suffragettes in England. As president of NAWSA, Shaw was pressured to support these tactics. Nevertheless, Shaw maintained that she was \\"unalterably opposed to militancy, believing nothing of permanent value has ever been secured by it that could not have been more easily obtained by peaceful methods.\\" She remained aligned with Anthony's philosophy that was against any militant tactics. In 1915, she resigned as NAWSA president and was replaced by her ally Carrie Chapman Catt. Later years and death During World War I, Shaw was head of the Women's Committee of the United States Council of National Defense, for which she became the first woman to earn the Distinguished Service Medal. She continued to lecture for the suffrage cause for the remaining years of her life. At an appearance only months before her death at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, Shaw said, \\"The only way to refute\\" the argument that America was a democracy and therefore women were entitled to vote was \\"to prove that women are not people.\\" She ended the speech by urging the women in attendance to become involved in the women's suffrage movement.The Lariat (Waco, Texas), Vol. 20, No. 27, Thursday, April 17, 1919 http://digitalcollections.baylor.edu/cdm/ref/collection/lariat/id/5214 She was a speaker at the 1919 National Conference on Lynching, presenting women's suffrage as a step against lynching. Shaw died of pneumonia at her home in Moylan, Pennsylvania at the age of seventy-two, only a few months before Congress ratified the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. Personal life Home where Shaw lived with her companion, Lucy Anthony, the niece of Susan B. Anthony. Shaw built a home at 240 Ridley Creek Rd., Media, during her tenure as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Assn. (1904‚Äì1915) and lived there with her companion Lucy Elmina Anthony (1859‚Äì1944), niece of Susan B. Anthony, until her death. Lucy and Anna were together for thirty years, and she was by her bedside when she died. Legacy Her 1915 speech \\"The Fundamental Principle of a Republic\\" was listed as number 27 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). In 2000, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Twenty years later, in 2020, she was named an honoree of the National Women's History Alliance. The Anna Howard Shaw Women's Center at Albion College \\"coordinates educational programming that promotes inclusiveness and pluralism and raises awareness of women's and gender-related issues. Examples include programming on sexual harassment and sexual assault. The most visible event sponsored by the Center is the Anna Howard Shaw Women's History Month Program, designated each year to honor Dr. Shaw's memory and highlight an important aspect of women's lives. Other educational programs are co-sponsored with student organizations that share mutual interests.Anna Howard Shaw Women's Center. \\"The Anna Howard Shaw Center at Boston University School of Theology promotes structures and practices that empower women and honor diversity.

The episcopal see is Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. The Archdiocese is the centre of the Ecclesiastical Province of Liverpool which covers the north of England as well as the Isle of Man. History With the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Roman Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century, Rome decided to proceed to bridge the gap of the centuries from Queen Elizabeth I by instituting Catholic dioceses on the regular historical pattern. Thus Pope Pius IX issued the Bull Universalis Ecclesiae of 29 September 1850 by which thirteen new dioceses which did not formally claim any continuity with the pre-Elizabethan English dioceses were created. One of these was the diocese of Liverpool. Initially it comprised the Hundreds of West Derby, Leyland, Fylde, Amounderness and Lonsdale in Lancashire and the Isle of Man. In the early period from 1850 the diocese was a suffragan of the Metropolitan See of Westminster, but a further development was the creation under Pope Pius X on 28 October 1911, of a new Province of Liverpool (also known as the Northern Province). Location The archdiocese covers an area of 1,165 km¬≤ (450 sq. mi.) of the west of the County of Lancashire south of the Ribble (West Lancashire and part of South Ribble), parts of Merseyside, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, the historic Hundreds of West Derby and Leyland and the Isle of Man. The see is in the City of Liverpool, where the Archbishop's cathedra or seat is located in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King, which was dedicated on 14 May 1967.

Bishop McMahon was enthroned as Archbishop of Liverpool on 1 May 2014. Bishop Thomas Anthony Williams was previously appointed Apostolic Administrator during the sede vacante, until the appointment of a new archbishop, following the resignation of Archbishop Patrick Kelly, with effect from 28 February 2013. Cathedral Church The Cathedral steps The Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King (usually shortened to Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Liverpool, England. It replaced the Pro-Cathedral of St. Nicholas, Copperas Hill. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Liverpool, the mother church of Liverpool's Catholics, and the metropolitan church of the Catholic Church's northern province in England. In 1853 Bishop Goss awarded the commission for the building of a new Roman Catholic cathedral to Edward Welby Pugin (1833‚Äì1875), the son of Augustus Welby Pugin, the joint architect of the Houses of Parliament and champion of the Gothic Revival. By 1856 the Lady Chapel of the new cathedral had been completed on a site adjacent to the Catholic Institute on Saint Domingo Road, Everton. Due to financial restrictions work on the building ceased at this point and the Lady Chapel now named Our Lady Immaculate served as parish church to the local Catholic population until its demolition in the 1980s. The south elevation and main entrance to the Cathedral Following purchase of the present site at Brownlow Hill in 1930 Sir Edwin Lutyens (1869‚Äì1944) was commissioned to provide a design which would be an appropriate response to the Gilbert Scott- designed Neo-gothic Anglican cathedral then emerging at the other end of Hope Street. Lutyens' design would have created a massive classical/Byzantine structure that would have become the second-largest church in the world. It would have had the world's largest dome. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 5 June 1933, but again financial restrictions caused the abandonment of this plan after construction of the crypt. The new cathedral, designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd and consecrated in 1967, was built on land adjacent to the crypt. Its circular plan was conceived in direct response to the Second Vatican Council's requirements for a greater and more intimate integration of the congregation with the clergy. :\\"Mother Church earnestly desires that all the faithful should be led to that fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations \\" Second Vatican Council 1962-1965 Chapels are built in between the buttresses that support the tent- shaped spire (which represents the crown of thorns of Jesus) like tent poles. A short film, Crown of Glass, documents the construction of the cathedral's rainbow-coloured stained glass windows. The cathedral stands on the site of the Liverpool Workhouse, on Hope Street. Facing it at the opposite end of Hope Street is the Cathedral Church of Christ, Liverpool's Anglican cathedral. Ironically, Lutyens was an Anglican, while the architect of the Anglican cathedral, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was Catholic. Ministries=Youth service Animate Youth Ministries is the youth service for the Archdiocese of Liverpool. The team, based at Lowe House, St Helens, is led by Fr Simon Gore, and consists of a leadership team and a volunteer team all living in community together at Lowe House. Animate Youth Ministries works with school and parish groups on day retreats, mission days and mission weeks, and also holds youth Masses which take place at St Mary's Church, Lowe House, St. Helens. The Liverpool Archdiocesan Youth form an integral part of the annual Liverpool Archdiocesan Lourdes Pilgrimage. , the team works with over 9,000 young people each year. Missionary project The Archdiocese of Liverpool has a long tradition of sending priests to work on the missions in Latin America, in particular Peru, This is known as the Liverpool Archdiocesan Missionary Project or colloquially as LAMP. In 2014, there were two priests involved in ministering to disadvantaged communities in Latin America, namely Simon Cadwallader and Dennis Parry.http://www.liverpoolcatholic.org.uk/index.php?p=208 Annual Lourdes Pilgrimage In 1923, the first official Archdiocesan pilgrimage set off from Liverpool for Lourdes and continues to the present day, interrupted only by the period of the Second World War. Led by the Archbishop or his Auxiliary, the week-long pilgrimage normally takes place each year between the end of July and beginning of August. During the week ordinary pilgrims from across the Archdiocese meet to participate in services & processions whilst assisted pilgrims are cared for by Liverpool Hospitalit√© members and helpers from the Archdiocesean Youth Service.

It is the Metropolitan see of the Province of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh, consisting of the additional suffragan sees of Aberdeen, Argyll and the Isles, Dunkeld, and Galloway. The archdiocese is led by Archbishop Leo Cushley.Archbishop urges faithful to resist pessimism ahead of parish closures History After the Scottish Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church abandoned the ancient dioceses and hierarchy. In 1653, the whole of Scotland became under the authority the Prefecture Apostolic of Scotland, which in 1694 was elevated to the Vicariate Apostolic of Scotland. On 23 July 1727, Scotland was divided into two Vicariates Apostolic, the Lowland District and Highland District. The Lowland District comprised roughly the Scottish Lowlands. On 13 February 1827, Scotland was divided again into three Vicariate Apostolics, the Eastern District (formerly the Lowland District), the Northern District (formerly the Highland District), and the Western District (created from territory of the other two districts). The Eastern District comprised the sixteen eastern historic counties of Perthshire, Angus, Kincardineshire, Stirlingshire, Clackmannanshire, Kinross, Fife, West Lothian, Mid Lothian, East Lothian, Peebleshire, Selkirkshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, Dumfrieshire, Roxburghshire, and Berwickshire. Following the restoration of the Scottish hierarchy by Pope Leo XIII on 15 March 1878, part of the Eastern District was elevated to the status of an Archdiocese with the title St Andrews & Edinburgh. In Lent 2015, Archbishop Cushley outlined his vision for the future of the Archdiocese in a Pastoral Letter entitled \\"We Have Found the Messiah\\". The document stated aim was to \\"respond to the mission entrusted to him [Archbishop Cushley] by Pope Francis: to bring the joy of the Gospel to contemporary society.\\" Following the publication of the letter, Archbishop Cushley embarked upon 32 public meetings across the Archdiocese to discuss his vision which includes the possibility of creating larger parish units through either mergers or closures. The process of review is likely to continue until 2017. The archdiocese controls the Mount Vernon Cemetery. In 2017 the former superintendent of the cemetery was convicted of mis-selling burial plots for 9 years, for example by re-selling used plots, defrauding the archdiocese and families.

Bush, several American politicians sought to either investigate Bush for possible impeachable offenses, or to bring actual impeachment charges on the floor of the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The most significant of these efforts occurred on June 10, 2008, when Congressman Dennis Kucinich, along with co-sponsor Robert Wexler, introduced 35 articles of impeachmentH. Res. 1258, 110th Cong. (2008). against Bush to the U.S. House of Representatives. The House voted 251 to 166 to refer the impeachment resolution to the Judiciary Committee on June 11, where no further action was taken on it.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi- bin/bdquery/z?d110:HE01258:@@@X Bush's presidency ended on January 20, 2009, with the completion of his second term in office, rendering impeachment efforts moot.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the most substantial portion of the articles of impeachment introduced by Kucinich and Wexler. Fifteen of the 35 articles directly relate to alleged misconduct by Bush in seeking authority for the war, and in the conduct of military action itself. Five other articles address allegations partially or tertiarily relating to the war, including the \\"outing\\" of Valerie Plame, treatment of prisoners (both in Iraq and from operations in Afghanistan and other countries), and building a case for Iran being a threat based in part on alleging Iranian actions in Iraq. Justification for invasion The first four impeachment articles charge the president with illegally creating a case for war with Iraq, including charges of a propaganda campaign, falsely representing Iraq as responsible for 9/11, and falsely representing Iraq as an imminent danger to the United States. Legitimacy of invasion Articles 5‚Äì8 and 12 deal with the invasion of Iraq and include charges that funds were misspent before the war, that the war was in violation of HJRes114, that Iraq was invaded without a war declaration, that the war is a violation of the UN Charter, and that the purpose of the war was to control the country's oil supplies. Conduct of the Iraq War Articles 9, 10, 11 and 13 deal with conduct of the war, including failing to provide troops with body armor, falsifying US troop deaths and injuries, establishing a permanent military base in Iraq, and creating a secret task force to develop energy and military policies with respect to Iraq and other countries. Articles 15 and 16 cover contractors in Iraq and charges that the president misspent money on contractors and provided them with immunity. Valerie Plame Article 14 is about the revelation of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame. Treatment of detainees Articles 17‚Äì20 concern the treatment of detainees, the \\"kidnapping\\" and detention of foreign nationals, and the use of torture. Attempt to overthrow the government of Iran Article 21 claims that the president misled Congress and the American people about threats from Iran, and supported terrorist organizations within Iran, with the goal of overthrowing the Iranian government. NSA warrantless surveillance controversy Articles 24 and 25 charge the president with illegally spying on American citizens, directing US telecom companies to create databases of citizens, and violating the fourth amendment of the US Constitution. Signing statements Article 26 concerns the presidential use of signing statements. Congressional subpoenas Article 27 is about failing to comply with congressional subpoenas. 2004 elections Articles 28 and 29 charge the president with tampering with the 2004 elections and violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Medicare Article 30 states \\"Misleading Congress and the American People in an Attempt to Destroy Medicare.\\" Katrina Article 31 concerns the supposed failure to plan and respond to Hurricane Katrina. Global warming Article 32 charges the president with \\"Systematically Undermining Efforts to Address Global Climate Change.\\" 9/11 Articles 33, 34 and 35 concern 9/11, alleging that the president failed to respond to prior intelligence, obstructed post-9/11 investigations and endangered the health of 9/11 first responders.

Bush, called for an investigation of the president in 2005. On June 16, 2005, Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) assembled an unofficial meeting to discuss the Downing Street memo and to consider grounds for impeachment. Conyers filed a resolution on December 18, 2005, to create an investigative committee to consider impeachment. His resolution gained 38 co- sponsors before it expired at the end of the 109th Congress. He did not reintroduce a similar resolution for the 110th Congress.H.RES.635 - Creating a select committee to investigate the Administration's intent to go to war before congressional authorization, manipulation of pre-war intelligence, encouraging and countenancing torture, retaliating against critics, and to make recommendations regarding grounds for possible impeachment Sponsor: Rep Conyers, John, Jr. (introduced December 18, 2005) Keith Ellison was the leading figure behind the resolution to impeach Bush brought to the Minnesota State House of Representatives in May 2006. Ellison was elected to the United States House of Representatives in November 2006. During the campaign and when he was named to the House Judiciary Committee, Ellison repeatedly called for an investigation into a possible impeachment. In support of his candidacy, he \\"received a $1,000 contribution from ImpeachPAC\\". Retrieved January 27, 2007 Ellison would later note that his \\"opinions really have not changed over time, but the circumstances\\" regarding his position in Congress had, and he was a \\"step before impeachment\\". At another unofficial hearing convened by Conyers on January 20, 2006, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) called for the committee to explore whether Bush should face impeachment, stemming from his decision to authorize domestic surveillance without court review. On May 10, 2006, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) indicated she was not interested in pursuing impeachment and had taken it \\"off the table\\", reiterating this phrase on November 8, 2006, after the election.Democrats Won't Try to Impeach President by Charles Babington, Washington Post, 12 May 2006Pelosi Says Democrats Are Ready to Lead by NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press, 8 November 2006 In July 2007, Pelosi stated that she \\"would probably advocate\\" impeaching Bush if she were not in the House nor Speaker of the House.Ari Berman:Why Pelosi Opposes Impeachment.

Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich's major point in the Democratic Presidential Debate on October 30, 2007, was that Bush and Cheney should be impeached for the Iraq War. On November 6, 2007, Kucinich introduced a resolution to impeach Vice President Cheney in the House of Representatives. In November 2007, Joe Biden, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, stated that he would move to impeach if President Bush were to bomb Iran without first gaining congressional approval. However, no such bombing occurred during the rest of Bush's term. On June 9, 2008, Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), introduced a resolution, , to impeach president George W. Bush, which included 35 counts in the articles of impeachment. At the end of the evening on June 10, Kucinich offered a motion to refer HRes 1258 to the House Judiciary Committee.

Her long broadcasting career spanned four talk show incarnations, numerous trips to the east and west coasts of the United States, and dozens of conversations with television and motion pictures stars. When she died, US Representative Jo Bonner honored her memory; it is entered in the Congressional Record.Jo Bonner, \\"Honoring the Memory of Mrs. Dorothy Moore,\\" Early years She was born in Pensacola, Florida, and her family moved to Mobile when she was 12. Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Fillette had her young mind and eyes set on becoming an actress. One indication was her attempt at imitating movies such as those featuring Joan Crawford, whom Dot viewed on days when she voluntarily skipped school. Eventually she concluded that theater didn't have a particular lure, even though she managed to perform on stage locally. Dot's interests to perform before an audience would resurface during her years on television, as it gave her an easy, yet natural feeling. Before fulfilling her lifelong dreams, Moore would finish her schooling at Leinkauf Elementary and Murphy High School before her first job as a secretary close to her father, who was in the steamship business. She next worked in the registrar's office at the University of Alabama Expansion Center, sharpening her future interview skills in the process. While at the university, Dot was offered a place in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in downtown Mobile and the U.S. Air Force office at Brookley Field. The investigative position at the Air Force office came shortly after she married Baltimore native Robert Joseph Miller. Her husband died from tuberculosis, leaving Dot and two-year-old year son Bobby behind. Following her husband's death, Dot opened \\"Dot's Dress Shoppe\\" on Springhill Avenue establishment. There, Dot met the two women who would introduce her to the radio and television business, a radio personality going on vacation and Connie Bea Hope who invited Dot over to her television show. Five years after Bob Miller's death, Dot met her second husband, Lon Stephens Moore of Missouri, when a friend invited him over to her Dauphin Street home. Again, illness would halt Dot's marriage, and the two people Mr. Moore knew very briefly were left alone again. Weeks after a period of mourning, Dot went back to work after finding a job at the same radio station that introduced her to broadcasting, WABB. The half way point Moore was a receptionist at WABB in 1958, a position under the Mobile Register-owned station that would lead to speaking before a wide radio audience with her low tone voice, earning the liking of one WABB announcer. Radio and TV commercials, including a televised March of Dimes public service announcement featuring Moore as a donor would earn her something more than a year after working for WABB and WKAB radio, the daily half-hour program \\"Channel 10 Kitchen\\" on WALA-TV after the previous chef had to leave for health reasons. Dot, however, was not a cook. WALA's solution was to find a professional chef and let Moore assist before the viewers. Dot also got the last remark in the program's live commercials sponsored by General Electric. Even after retirement, Dot was not very fond of cooking herself, yet up until the very end of her career, she was still seen speaking to her cooking guests in the studio kitchen. Dot managed to keep her son well nourished on something as easy to prepare as tuna fish casserole, in which Bobby would joke about at times. After the cooking show contract was finished, Dot returned to radio as a commercial copy writer in the WALA radio traffic department. There were also times when the TV side of the building called upon Dot for their commercials or public service spots. She was fired after a dispute with the new radio manager over paperwork that violates broadcasting rules in general. Termination gave Dot time to free- lance in media during the early 1960s. In this busy period of trying to stay in Gulf Coast media and keeping things well at home, Dot was contacted by a WALA-TV announcer who wanted her to co-host the station's new program Poolside from the Admiral Semmes Hotel in downtown Mobile. Dot accepted the job and continued to expand her horizons, creatively and physically. After a successful run of Poolside, Dot returned to free-lancing, including some work for Gayfer's department store and their commercials for Pensacola station WEAR-TV. Just when Dot was getting ready to step out of the public eye after a week of commercials and public appearances in Pensacola, a friend employed at WALA stopped by the Gayfer's store to deliver her some good news. A new afternoon talk show of her very own was set to premiere on the following Monday, with all the guests booked for that week. On May 14, 1963, Dot Moore & Company went the air between noon and 12:30 p.m. The radio manager who had fired Dot was eventually fired shortly after learning of her return from his TV counterpart. Viewers from south Mississippi to the Florida panhandle also got to see Dot help WALA cover Mobile's Mardi Gras Day celebration for 33 years. Ten years after Dot Moore & Company went on the air, Dot was given an on-air partner named Danny Treanor and the show became known as Gulf Coast Today in 1973. The 9:00 a.m. program following NBC's Today continued with this format for the next four years until Dot regained the position of host and producer of the show. In September 1979, Gulf Coast Today began airing once a week before it again bore Dot's name. The Dot Moore Show would remain on WALA's schedule well into the 21st century. Dot and the stars Over her career, Moore met numerous wealthy and famous people for TV interviews, which was quite easy for journalists and TV personalities during a time before satellite became a common way of conducting interviews. Out of all the people she's met, it was former Pensacola resident and friend Leif Erickson of the NBC western \\"The High Chaparral\\" who helped keep Dot's relationship with the network's stars alive for years to come. With such a Hollywood connection came a few roles on television, including Erickson's program and the show Movin' On with Claude Akins, another one of Dot's many guests (Movin' On was filmed on location once in Mobile and its surrounding areas). Besides people, Dot had an encounter with a Bengal tiger and its trainer, which went through fairly well despite a wet moment that would make Johnny Carson and the monkey he encountered laugh. All good things would come to an end in 1985, when NBC ended Moore's flights to visit the famous and must settle with the network's newly installed satellite technology to keep in touch, but there were exceptions. Art Linkletter and Jock Mahoney were Dot's first celebrated guests three weeks into her show's run. The \\"People Are Funny\\" emcee and the \\"Yancy Derringer\\" star happened to be in Mobile the same day. Ed McMahon made a visit to Mobile for the America's Junior Miss national finals in May 1973, plus he made a stop at WALA to appear on Moore's tenth anniversary show on May 14. \\"And now, here's Dottie!\\" was Ed's introduction for his friend Dot as she was getting ready to go on the air, which came as such a surprise that it never made it into the show's taping. Later years During the 1990s, Moore's Sunday community service program and fourth incarnation had a greater focus on public affairs figures than interviews with the stars. Despite her lessening presence over WALA-TV, which swapped its 43-year affiliation with NBC for Fox in 1996, Dot continued to tell people about her days of traveling outside Mobile. Hundreds of photos featuring her and the people she had met over the years served as a visual aid. Longtime viewers have noticed various changes in Dot's hairstyle and color since appearing on television. During her years under the eyes of sponsors, there were times when they wanted a blonde, brunette, or redheaded lady on the air. Dot would pay for her own hairstyle around 1994. Another surprise Dot had for her viewers were a pair of knee high boots from California, which had the WALA switchboard lit up by those interested in her footwear. The Dot Moore Show went on the air for the last time on July 11, 2004, less than a week after Moore had a car accident. According to many Mobile residents, including friend and fellow local media personality Uncle Henry, this accident was the reason for Dot's retirement and move to Montgomery. She died on May 23, 2007, in Montgomery, Alabama.

The breed is listed in the UKC Guardian Dog Group. Five years prior to UKC recognition, the breed was registered by the former Canine Developmental, Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR), a privately held business located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In the early 2000s, CDHPR had been working with the UKC under a unique agreement to develop breeding plans and strategies in an effort to produce improved breeds of dogs that would be accepted as purebred and, therefore, eligible for UKC registration. In the early 1970s, dog breeder David Leavitt of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, wanted to \\"recreate a with the looks, health and athleticism of the 18th which was originally created for the English sport of bull baiting between the years 1100 to 1835\\". Capitalization style of the quotation is preserved from the original. In an effort to rapidly achieve his goal for a purebred dog, Leavitt modeled his program after a livestock line breeding scheme developed by Nathan Fechimer, a professor in the Department of Dairy Science, Ohio State University. The foundation breeding for what became the modern Olde English Bulldogge consisted of one-half Bulldog, one-sixth Bullmastiff, one-sixth American Pit Bull Terrier and one-sixth American Bulldog. The result was an athletic breed that looks similar to the bulldogs of 1820, but with a friendly temperament, fewer health issues, and with longevity reaching into the teens. U.S. researchers have said the Olde English Bulldogge is a \\"viable candidate\\" as an outcross on which to rebuild the Bulldog; a breed that genetic studies have suggested is so inbred that it \\"cannot be returned to health without an infusion of new bloodlines.\\"  History  The Olde English Bulldogge was an attempt to recreate the \\"Regency Period Bull Baiter\\" and was developed in the early 1970s by David Leavitt, of Coatesville, PA. Leavitt began his project in 1971 utilizing the cattle line breeding scheme of Dr. Fechimer from Ohio State University. The goal was to create a dog with the look, health, and athleticism of the original bull- baiting dogs, but with a much less aggressive temperament. The foundation crosses consisted of one-half Bulldog, one-sixth American Bulldog, one-sixth Bullmastiff and one-sixth of other breeds. After many planned crosses, the Olde English Bulldogge emerged and began to breed true. Leavitt formed the Olde English Bulldogge Association (OEBA) to maintain the breed's stud book and issue registration papers to future offspring. During the 1980s, Ben and Karen Campetti from Sandisfield, Massachusetts, worked closely with Leavitt in breeding the Olde English Bulldogge. In 1993, Leavitt stopped breeding and turned the OEBA registry as well as his personal breeding stock over to Working Dog Inc. which was owned and operated by Michael Walz of Pennsylvania. In 2001 the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club (OEBKC) was formed, and in 2005 David Leavitt was involved with merging the Olde English Bulldogge Association's registry with that of the OEBKC's. The Olde English Bulldogge was enrolled with the Canine Developmental Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR) in August 2008 in order to evaluate the breed for recognition within the UKC as a purebred breed of dog. In 2013, the UKC announced that the Olde English Bulldogge would become a fully recognized breed as of January 1, 2014. The OEBKC is currently the recognized Parent Club for the breed with the United Kennel Club (UKC). Leavitt Bulldog Leavitt Bulldog In order to maintain his original breeding aims and to distinguish his line of Olde English Bulldogges from those of other breeders, in 2004 David Leavitt named his line of dogs Leavitt Bulldogs (sometimes spelled \\"Bulldogges\\"), founding the Leavitt Bulldog Association the following year. The UKC recognizes dogs registered with the Leavitt Bulldog Association as Olde English Bulldogges, along with those registered with the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club and the Olde Bulldogge Club Europe.  Appearance  UKC Olde English Bulldogge female at 8 years old The Olde English Bulldogge is a muscular, medium-sized dog of great strength, and possesser of fluid, agile movement. They are well- balanced and proportioned, while appearing capable of performing without any breathing restrictions in either heat or in cold. Serious Faults: Excessive wrinkle, lack of pigment around eyes, nose or mouth. Olde English Bulldogges can have different coat colors The skull is large and well-proportioned to the dog's muscular body and prominent shoulders. There is a defined furrow between the eyes (from the stop to the occiput). Narrow skull and domed forehead are faults. The muzzle is square, wide and deep. Bite is undershot or reverse scissors. Lower jawbone is moderately curved from front to back. Nostrils are wide, with a line running vertically between nostrils from the tip of nose down to the bottom of the upper lip. Nose is large and broad in relationship to the width of the muzzle. Nose color is black. Eyes are medium in size and almond shaped, dark to light brown, with black pigmented eye rims. They are set wide and low, level with the top of the muzzle. Ears are small, rose, button or tulip. Rose is preferred. They are set high, wide and to the back outer edge of the skull. The neck is medium length, wide, and slightly arched. The body is sturdy, powerful and slightly rectangular when viewed from the side. Chest is wide and deep. Hind legs are well muscled and have the appearance of being slightly longer than the forelegs. The hind legs should be straight, parallel and set apart. Accepted color patterns include brindle, and solid colors, with or without white. Males should be 60 to 80 pounds, and 17 to 20 inches at the withers, while females should be 50 to 70 pounds, and 16 to 19 inches at the withers.  Health  The Olde English Bulldogge may be a healthier breed of dog than many modern bulldog breeds, though they can be affected by many of the same disorders that occur in any breed. Proponents of the breed maintain that it does not suffer from the same disorders as purebred Bulldogs. A 2016 study published in the journal Canine Genetics and Epidemiology examined genetic diversity among 102 registered Bulldogs. The Olde English Bulldogge was mentioned as an outcross candidate to introduce new genetics in an effort to correct some of the problems associated with inbreeding. In the European Union, rules have been written specifically for farm animals which state they have the rights of \\"freedom from discomfort\\" and \\"freedom from pain, injury and disease.\\" A 2013 constitutional amendment in Switzerland restates the EU rules in greater detail, and extends such rights to all animals. Many Swiss dog breeders have begun outcrossing Bulldogs with the Olde English Bulldogge, having created the Continental Bulldog in an effort to bring the Bulldog into compliance. Many breeders are now X-raying hips to reduce the incidence of hip dysplasia, as well as having dogs evaluated by organisations such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). The Olde English Bulldogge is also quickly becoming well-respected in many working dog disciplines such as weight pull, therapy training, and obedience. They have become excellent breathers, but still are comparatively sensitive to heat. Artificial insemination is not a standard protocol when breeding Olde English Bulldogges; natural ties are the standard. Breeders from the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club provide educational materials for new breeders, on genetic disorders and the benefits that modern genetic testing for disorders can have on preventing further inheritance of such medical problems in domestic animals. Many breeders are also becoming more aware of how important selective breeding can be to the breed as a whole.

History Southwark was one of the dioceses established at the restoration of Catholic hierarchical structures in 1850 by Pope Pius IX.\\"History\\", St. George's Cathedral When first erected, the diocese included Berkshire, Hampshire, and the Channel Islands in addition to Surrey, Kent and Sussex. Previous to this these five counties formed part of the London District, which district was governed by a vicar Apostolic, to whom also was committed episcopal jurisdiction over North America and the Bahama Islands. In 1850 London, even at that time a comparatively small city, which, owing to the exigencies of the times, had previously been under the jurisdiction of a single bishop, was now divided between the two new Dioceses of Westminster (north of the Thames) and Southwark (south of the Thames).Cunningham, William. \\"Southwark.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 31 January 2020 The first bishop of the new diocese of Southwark was the Right Rev. Thomas Grant, D.D., vice-rector of the English College, Rome. He was consecrated On 6 July, 1851. Grant was instrumental in obtaining some Sisters of Mercy from Bermondsey to serve as nurses in the military hospitals during the Crimean War.Paradis, Mary Raphael et al. \\"The Sisters of Mercy in the Crimean War: Lessons for Catholic health care.\\" The Linacre Quarterly vol. 84,1 (2017): 29‚Äì43 Grant was succeeded by his vicar-general, James Danell.

The area that formed the diocese when originally created (29th September 1950) changed on 19 May 1882 when Southwark lost territory with the formation of the Diocese of Portsmouth. The Diocese of Southwark lost further territory when the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton separated on 28th May 1965; at the same time the Ecclesiastical Province of Southwark was erected by Pope Paul VI, raising the Diocese to archdiocesan status.https://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsout.html Bishops/Archbishops * Bishop Thomas Grant (1851‚Äì1870) * Bishop James Danell (1871‚Äì1881) * Bishop Robert Coffin C.Ss.R.

Priests no longer moved in fear of imprisonment. Roman Catholics could run their own schools and could once more acquire property. In protest against the act, Lord George Gordon, on 2 June 1780, gathered a large crowd in St George's Fields to march on Westminster. Refused a hearing, they became violent and so began a week of burning, plundering and killing in which many Roman Catholic chapels and houses were destroyed. There is a legend that the high altar of the cathedral stands on the spot where the march began. In 1786 there was only one Roman Catholic chapel in the whole of south London, located at Bermondsey. It was then that the Reverend Thomas Walsh, a Douai priest, for ¬£20 a year hired a room in Bandyleg Walk\\"St George's Cathedral.\\" Survey of London: Volume 25, St George's Fields (The Parishes of St. George the Martyr Southwark and St. Mary Newington). Ed. Ida Darlington. London: London County Council, 1955. 72‚Äì75. British History Online (near where the Southwark fire station now stands). Within two years, the numbers attending the little chapel had increased so rapidly that a new building became necessary. In 1793 a large chapel dedicated to St George was opened in the London Road at a cost of ¬£2,000. It was designed by James Taylor of Weybridge, Surrey. According to tradition it was here that the first High Mass was celebrated in London, outside the chapels of ambassadors, since the time of King James II of England. The occasion was the Solemn Requiem sung for the repose of the soul of Louis XVI of France, who was executed on 21 January 1793. It was to St George's that the Reverend Thomas Doyle came in 1820, when the congregation stood at around 7,000. He became the first chaplain in 1829, when the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 removed nearly all the legal disabilities which Catholics had suffered for 250 years. The arrival of Irish immigrants in the area necessitated the construction of a larger house of worship. By 1839 enough money had been collected to make a start and the present site in St George's Fields (then an open space) was purchased for ¬£3,200. Augustus Pugin, the noted architect of the Gothic Revival, was commissioned to design the church. The foundation stone was laid on 26th May, 1841 in a private ceremony held in the early morning so as not to arouse public unrest. Due to cost constraints, the left tower was never built. The stained glass was by William Wailes of Newcastle.Bumpus, T. F., London Churches, Ancient and Modern, 2nd Series, 1907, p. 174. The church was solemnly opened by Bishop Nicholas Wiseman (later Cardinal Wiseman) on 4 July 1848.\\"History\\", St. George's Cathedral To mark the occasion, Pope Pius IX sent a golden chalice and paten as a gift. Pugin was the first person to be married in the church on 10 August 1848 to his third wife Jane. When Pope Pius restored the English Roman Catholic hierarchy, St George's was chosen as the cathedral church of the new Roman Catholic Diocese of Southwark, which was to cover the whole of southern England. For the next half-century, until the opening of Westminster Cathedral, St George's was the centre of Roman Catholic life in London. In response to the hostile reaction of many of the British peple to what was popularly characterized as \\"papal aggression\\", Bishop Nicholas Wiseman wrote \\"Appeal to the Reason and Good Feeling of the English people on the subject of the Catholic Hierarchy\\", a pamphlet of some thirty pages, addressed to the people themselves rather than to the educated minority who in the writer's view had so grossly and inexcusably misled them. Wiseman followed this with a series of lectures given at St. George's.Hunter-Blair, Oswald. \\"Nicholas Patrick Wiseman.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 2 March 2020 In Thomas Grant was made the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Southwark; Doyle became the provost and administrator and remained so until his death on 6 June 1879. He is buried in the crypt. The new cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Butt on 7 November 1894 and on that day every year the feast of the dedication of the cathedral is celebrated throughout the diocese. Structure As of 10 June 2010, there were three auxiliary bishops: Patrick Lynch SS.CC., titular bishop of Castrum; and Paul Hendricks, titular Bishop of Ross and Cromarty; Paul Mason, titular Bishop of Sk√°laholt. These bishops have particular pastoral responsibility in South East London, South West London and Kent respectively.

Biography He was born in 1925 in Chungking, China, to Methodist missionary parents Ralph and Grace Kipka Blanchard. When the Blanchard family returned home to the United States, Richard grew up as a child and youth in Indiana and North Carolina. Rev. Ralph Blanchard moved from Wolcottville, Indiana, to Tryon, North Carolina, in 1942, bringing his family with him. Blanchard was a senior in high school and graduated from Tryon High School in 1943. During that year, he worked at a Tryon bank, putting his income into war bonds. This financial tactic eventually enabled him to buy lakefront property at Lake Conway, Orange County, Florida, in 1953. There were other interests and hobbies that were consistent throughout Blanchard's life: He loved boating and dining by the water. He was an avid traveler, whether conducting tours or driving on his own, in over 75 countries. Blanchard had a fondness for fine art and art museums. He followed sports closely and often attended various spectator-sports events. A believer that a busy mind is a sharp mind, Blanchard enjoyed word games such as Scrabble as well as collecting stamps and coins. Above all, however, Blanchard enjoyed meeting, learning about, and helping people. By 2000, Blanchard's health began a serious decline. He and his wife Anne moved to Swannanoa, North Carolina, to be near their children. He lived there until his death on April 19, 2004. Education After high school graduation in 1943, Blanchard attended Davidson College for one year and then enlisted in the United States Navy. Receiving a medical discharge, he entered Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947. In 1946 he married the former Anne Carlton of Oxford, Georgia, a graduate of Wesleyan College. They had three children‚ÄîRichard Jr. (d. 1996), Carol Ann, and Emily (d. 2005). After graduating from Mercer University, Blanchard enrolled in Candler School of Theology at Emory University, also in Georgia, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1949. Ministerial career Blanchard was ordained a deacon in 1949 and an elder in 1950, after serving two years as pastor of the four-church (\\"four- point\\") Snellville-Grayson circuit of the North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Church. Transferring to the Florida Conference in 1950, Blanchard completed 40 years in the ministry of the Methodist Church (which became The United Methodist Church on April 23, 1968), serving the following congregations: First Methodist in Orlando as associate pastor; then as senior pastor, Wesley, Coral Gables; First Methodist in Fort Lauderdale; Trinity Methodist in Miami; Palma Ceia in Tampa; First Methodist in Jacksonville; Riviera Beach Methodist; Community Methodist in Holiday; and Conway Methodist in Orlando. Retiring in 1988, Blanchard later renewed his participation in First United Methodist in Orlando and became a member of the Pendergrass Sunday School Class. Music and writing accomplishments During the late-1980s, Blanchard wrote a beautiful musical, ‚ÄúFrancis of Assisi,‚Äù which was produced by Glenn Longacre of Conway for an audience of 600 people. During this period, he was also named ‚ÄúMinister Emeritus‚Äù of the Conway Church. In addition to writing numerous gospel songs‚Äîmany of which were published and recorded‚ÄîBlanchard also wrote other things. While at Snellville as a young theolog, he wrote a column called Between You and Me every week for the Wesleyan Christian Advocate, the Methodist paper for North and South Georgia. He also wrote a story called ‚ÄúThe Little Star‚Äù which was published in Ideals magazine. Blanchard was selected to write an official biography of Bishop John Branscomb.

The Archbishop of Utrecht is the Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical province of Utrecht. There are six suffragan dioceses in the province: Breda, Groningen-Leeuwarden, Haarlem-Amsterdam, Roermond, Rotterdam, and 's-Hertogenbosch. The cathedral church of the archdiocese is Saint Catherine Cathedral which replaced the prior cathedral, Saint Martin Cathedral, after it was taken by Protestants in the Reformation. History In the Middle Ages, the bishops of Utrecht were also prince-bishops of the Holy Roman Empire. The diocese, founded in 695, was suppressed after 1580 owing to the rise of Protestantism. The Dutch Mission in various forms took care of the spiritual needs of Catholics in the former diocese of Utrecht until the modern archdiocese was established in 1853.

The group manages the regulated water and waste water network in North West England, which includes Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, most of Cheshire and a small area of Derbyshire, which have a combined population of more than seven million. The United Utilities Group was the electricity distribution network operator for the North West until 2010, when its electricity subsidiary was sold to Electricity North West. United Utilities' headquarters are in Warrington and the company has more than 5,000 direct employees. Its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the FTSE 100 Index. North West England is the wettest region in England, and water hardness across the region is soft to very soft. History In 1989 the North West Water Authority, which was responsible for the provision of water to the North West of England, was privatised and became North West Water Group plc. In 1995, the company acquired NORWEB plc, the then regional electricity distributor and supplier, and on 1 April 1996 changed its name to United Utilities plc. Within United Utilities group, the water and electricity businesses retained their separate identities. In January 1998, United Utilities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but delisted its shares in May 2007. In 2000, the North West Water and NORWEB branding was phased out in favour of United Utilities, the rebranding was completed by the end of 2001. The company sold some of the businesses it had acquired, its telecoms business, Your Communications was sold in February 2006, and Vertex in March 2007. In December 2007, United Utilities sold its electricity distribution network assets to North West Electricity Networks (Jersey) Limitied, a joint venture between funds run by Colonial First State (part of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia) and investment bank JPMorgan Chase. Electricity North West became the licensed Distribution Network Operator for the north west of England as a result. United Utilities operated and maintained the regional electricity network on behalf of Electricity North West until 2010, when Electricity North West bought the electricity network operations and maintenance arm from United Utilities to establish one Group.Electricity Northwest buys network operations arm from United Utilities Utility Week, 28 June 2010 In October 2011, United Utilities was selected as the preferred bidder by Severn Trent Water to purchase the Lake Vyrnwy estate for ¬£11 million. United Utilities later withdrew from the bidding process. In February 2012, United Utilities proposed a national water pipeline linking water sources in Manchester to London. In April 2016, United Utilities received an 18-year loan of ¬£500m from The European Investment Bank to support investment across the North West. In May 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority granted United Utilities and Severn Trent Water approval to create a new joint venture company in preparation for the water market deregulation. In June 2016, United Utilities and Severn Trent Water formed Water Plus, in readiness to provide the retail services for their non-household customers. In May 2019, the company announced the appointment of Sir David Higgins as a non-executive director and to succeed Dr John McAdam as chairman.https://www.unitedutilities.com/globalassets/z_corporate- site/financial-news-2019/appointment-of-dh-as-a-non-executive-director-v6.pdf Operations United Utilities' wastewater treatment plant for Preston, Lancashire United Utilities currently supplies water to a population of 7.3 million people across the North West.

In November 2019, a burst pipe in a local treatment works disrupted water supply in the CH 41/42/43/63 areas and bottled water supply points were set up. Water contamination  On 7 August 2015, cryptosporidium, a water borne parasite that can cause diarrhoea and vomiting, had been detected in the water supply to Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble and Wyre\\"Lancashire homes forced to boil water due to cryptosporidium bug\\", BBC News, 7 August 2015, accessed 28 August 2015 affecting more than 300,000 customers.\\"Lancashire water parasite alert enters fourth week\\", BBC News, 27 August 2015, accessed 28 August 2015 No cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported and by introducing of ultra-violet treatment units \\"boil water\\" notices could be lifted in some areas. Initial Investigations by United Utilities and the Drinking Water Inspectorate had not identified the cause. Later the root cause was identified as run-off water from agricultural land following severe rainfall. On 6 September 2015, the water supply was declared free from contamination, and restrictions were lifted. United Utilities was subsequently fined ¬£300,000 at Preston Crown Court on 10 October 2017 for supplying water unfit for human consumption, with an additional ¬£150,000 costs. It paid around ¬£18 million in compensation to its customers.

The village is located about south of the city of Haugesund in Western Norway. It sits on the mainland along the Karmsundet strait, directly across the strait from the village of Avaldsnes on the island of Karm√∏y. The village has a population (2014) of 2738, giving the village a population density of . History Vormedal was originally an area consisting mostly of farmland and it has a documented history going back to the early 1500s. Archaeological finds have indicated that the area has been populated for even longer, possibly for as long as 4000 years. The area was originally part of the parish (and municipality) of Avaldsnes. It was situated along the old church route that led churchgoers from the areas around the nearby F√∏rresfjorden in the east as they traveled to visit the Avaldsnes Church, after arriving in Vormedal, they had to take a short boat ride across the Karmsundet. Vormedal was also an important location for travelers coming from the village areas more to the south such as Snik, R√∏yksund, and Fosen as it was the most direct road to Haugesund. When the F√∏rre Church in the village of F√∏rre opened in 1893, some of the traffic going to and from the church stopped, and when the new main road called Spannevegen opened in the early 1900s, it connected Haugesund with R√∏yksund, but it ran east of Vormedal, so a lot of the commercial traffic also stopped. In 1965 the municipality of Avaldsnes was merged with the other municipalities on the island of Karm√∏y to form the new Karm√∏y municipality. In 1978 the first church on mainland Karm√∏y was opened, Norheim Church, located in the village of Norheim just north of Vormedal. This new church was the centre of a new parish which also included Vormedal. Today, Vormedal mostly consists of large residential areas, with one primary and one lower secondary school; three kindergartens as well as a fire station and a small shopping center. Vormedal also has an alginate production facility owned by FMC Health and Nutrition.

He served with the SS Division Totenkopf and the SS Division Reichsf√ºhrer-SS. He and the unit under his command committed the Marzabotto massacre in Italy in 1944. After the war, he was convicted of war crimes in Italy. SS career Walter Reder was born in Freiwaldau, Austrian Silesia, Austria-Hungary. He joined the SS- Verf√ºgungstruppe and was granted German citizenship in December 1934. During World War II, he served in the Waffen-SS. In December 1943, Reder was transferred to the newly formed 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf√ºhrer- SS and served in Italy until 1945. In 1943, Reder became the commander of the SS-Panzer-Aufkl√§rungsabteilung 16, which committed several massacres in 1944. In March 1945 his division withdrew to Hungary and later to Austria, where Reder surrendered, together with the rest of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Division, to British forces near Klagenfurt. Trial and conviction Reder was extradited to Italy in May 1948 to stand trial for war crimes. He was tried by an Italian military court in Bologna for ordering the destruction of town of Marzabotto and other villages near Bologna in August and September of 1944 during so- called anti-partisan sweeps, and for ordering the execution of 2,700 Italian civilians in Tuscany and Emilia during the same period. In October 1951 he was sentenced to life imprisonment at a fortress prison in Gaeta, on the coast north of Naples. The citizens of Marzabotto and survivors of the massacre voted 237 to 1 against freeing Reder. Local officials had stated that as many as 1,830 civilians died in massacres in and around Marzabotto. Years later, a group of SS men whom Reder had commanded in 1944 were tried and convicted for their role in the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre. Their convictions and sentencing were conducted in absentia. Reder was paroled in January 1985, after which he returned to Austria. He died in 1991.

The EP was created to be sold at shows while The Format were on tour with Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World. It also became available on iTunes. Physical copies of the album came with a promotional code to download 2 additional tracks from The Format's website. The EP includes two new songs (four if you count the free downloads) and acoustic versions of three tracks from 2003's Interventions + Lullabies. Atlantic Records After their record label, Elektra Records, was absorbed into the Warner Bros. system, The Format were moved to Atlantic Records. Atlantic released this EP, to allow The Format new material to sell while on tour with Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World, as it had been almost two years since they had released an album. The EP was first sold two days before the beginning of this tour, when The Format played a headlining show at The Green Door in Oklahoma City. The new tracks were intended as demo versions of songs that would appear on their second album, however, \\"Snails\\" is the only song from this EP that was re-recorded for Dog Problems. Shortly after the release of this EP, The Format were dropped from Atlantic Records. Bonus tracks The Format intended to include \\"Your New Name\\" and \\"Dear Boy\\" on physical copies of the EP. These tracks were recorded with a different producer than the rest of the EP and due to contractual conflicts, could not be included. The band instead gave away a promotional code with copies of the EP, which allowed you to download the songs for free from their website. Because of this, most people consider the songs to be tracks 6 and 7 on the EP. Digital versions of the EP suffered from the same contractual problems, but couldn't accommodate the promotional code. Anyone who purchases the EP digitally will only have access to the first 5 tracks.

Crime  On the night of March 9, 1963, LAPD officers Ian Campbell (age 31) and Karl Hettinger (age 28) were riding in an unmarked police car. They pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe containing two suspicious-looking men at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood. The two men, Gregory Ulas Powell (age 30) and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a. \\"Jimmy Youngblood\\", age 32), had recently committed a string of robberies, and \\"each had a pistol tucked into his trousers\\". Powell, the driver, pulled a gun on Campbell, who \\"calmly told his partner, 'He has a gun in my back. Give him your gun.'\\" The two officers were then forced into Powell's car and, within 30 seconds after the traffic stop began, were driven north from Los Angeles on Route 99, to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Campbell was fatally shot. Hettinger was able to escape, running nearly four miles to reach a farmhouse. The killing occurred primarily because Powell assumed that the kidnapping of the officers alone already constituted a capital crime under the state's Little Lindbergh Law. However, Powell's interpretation was incorrect. Under the Little Lindbergh Law at that time, kidnapping became a capital crime only if the victim were harmed or if a ransom were demanded. Today, kidnapping in California is punishable by life imprisonment, either with or without the possibility of parole, depending on the circumstances.  Aftermath  In April 1982, following the release from prison of Powell's accomplice Jimmy Lee Smith, Valerie Campbell, the daughter of the slain Officer Ian Campbell, contacted John Mancino. Mancino was the founder of Citizens for Truth, an organization that had recently led a successful petition effort to rescind the parole date of Sirhan Sirhan, who had been convicted of assassinating presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. Mancino drafted a petition to have Powell's scheduled release rescinded. With Valerie Campbell's help, he collected 31,500 signatures in three-and-a-half weeks, which were submitted to the California Board of Prison Terms, along with several thousand letters. The parole board then held a hearing and eventually rescinded Powell's release date. Following this, Powell's attorney was successful in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens for Truth's public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, which at the time was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens for Truth's representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison. The group prevailed both at the appeals court and the California Supreme Court, thereby leading to Powell's spending the rest of his life in prison, where he died in 2012. On August 10, 2012, the intersection of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood, the site of the officers' abduction, was named \\"Ian Campbell Square\\" in honor of the slain officer. Additionally, a section of the Hollywood Freeway (California State Route 101) in Hollywood, from Hollywood Boulevard to Highland Avenue, was designated the \\"Ian J. Campbell Memorial Freeway.\\"  Hettinger  Although Hettinger escaped, he felt scorned by his fellow officers and officials at the Los Angeles Police Department, and suffered severe emotional trauma for both the initial incident and the following treatment. Eventually a police training video was made using his experience as an example of what to do when stopping and approaching a vehicle. Hettinger was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1966, after being accused of shoplifting. Years later, he was elected a supervisor of Kern County, California, where he served multiple consecutive terms. He died of liver disease in 1994 at age 59.  The suspects  Powell was arrested on the night of the murder, after being spotted driving a stolen vehicle by California Highway Patrol officers. The following day, Smith was apprehended as well. The lead LAPD investigator on the case was Sergeant Pierce Brooks. Both suspects were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Ultimately, they received life sentences. For each, the lower court sentence followed a second trial and several appeals. Their death sentences were vacated when the California Supreme Court ruled in California v. Anderson (1972) that California's death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment. = Powell = At a parole board hearing on January 27, 2010, Powell was denied parole. In a January 21, 2010 letter to state corrections officials, Los Angeles Police Union President Paul Weber urged the board to deny parole, calling Powell a \\"vicious murderer who has not yet paid his debt to society\\". On October 18, 2011, the California State Parole Board denied compassionate release for Powell, who had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. The board stated that Powell did not wish to be released from prison and was likely to be uncooperative if paroled. Powell died on August 12, 2012, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville. He was 79 years old. = Smith = Smith was released in 1982 but returned to prison several times on drug-related parole violations. In December 2006, he failed to report to his parole officer, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In February 2007, a man matching Smith's description was detained by police in Los Angeles' Skid Row area and eventually identified as Smith. He was arrested, charged with violating his parole, and sent to the Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic, California. On April 7, 2007, while in that facility, he died of an apparent heart attack at age 76.  Film and television adaptations  The book was adapted into an 1979 film of the same name directed by Harold Becker. It starred John Savage as Karl Hettinger, James Woods as Gregory Powell, Franklyn Seales as Jimmy Smith, and Ted Danson (in his film debut) as Ian Campbell. TNT's Southland season 5 episode 9 titled \\"Chaos\\" (original airdate April 10, 2013) portrayed a reimagined version of the events that took place in The Onion Field. The Adam-12 episode \\"Killing Ground\\" was based on this incident. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed are kidnapped by two armed robbers on the run. The only difference is Malloy and Reed are able to escape and turn the tables on their captors.

The Fountain Paint Pot is named for the reds, yellows and browns of the mud in this area. The differing colors are derived from oxidation states of the iron in the mud. As with all hot springs, the heat in the caldera forces pressurized water up through the ground, which is expelled here. Also, rising gasses cause the bubbling action. The bubble action in the mud varies with the seasons. In the early summer, the mud is watery from the high water table due to rain and snow melt. By the end of summer, the mud is much thicker as the water table drops. Several significant geysers erupt near the Paint Pots, notably Fountain Geyser, which usually has several large eruptions a day; Clepsydra Geyser, which is active most of the time except following an eruption of Fountain; and powerful but erratic Morning Geyser, active in the latter part of 2018 following a dormancy of nearly five years. These features and others are reachable by a short boardwalk trail from the parking lot on the main road through Lower Geyser Basin.

Born in Rotterdam, de Vlieger moved in 1634 to Delft, where he joined the Guild of Saint Luke, and then to Amsterdam in 1638, though he maintained a house in Rotterdam until 1650 when he moved to Weesp, a small town on the outskirts of Amsterdam. In the 1630s and 1640s he was one of the best-known Dutch maritime painters. He moved away from the monochrome style of Jan Porcellis and Willem van de Velde, the elder towards a more realistic use of colour, with highly detailed and accurate representations of rigging and ship construction. He painted ships in harbour and at sea as well as storms and shipwrecks. In addition to painting, he designed tapestries, etchings, stained glass windows for the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, and the organ screen for the St. Laurenskerk in Rotterdam. His pupils included Willem van de Velde, the younger, Adriaen van de Velde, and Jan van de Cappelle. Jan van der Cappelle in fact owned 9 original De Vlieger paintings, and more than 1300 prints. When de Vleiger died in 1653 in Weesp, there were a number of unfinished but still beautiful works.

Originally founded as an \\"express\\" hotel, their focus is on offering limited services at a reasonable price. Standard amenities lean toward the convenient and practical which cater to business travelers and short-term stays. As of September 2019, there are 2,826 Holiday Inn Express hotels featuring over 292,000 rooms worldwide. The Holiday Inn Express concept was intended to target the \\"upper economy\\" market segment, offering limited service, low-price lodging. In Europe, the hotels were known as Express by Holiday Inn, but this variation was phased out during the Holiday Inn Global Brand Relaunch which was announced in 2006. History In 1991, the first Holiday Inn Express locations opened, with three hotels opening in the United States. Plans at the time called for 250 locations to be open by 1995. In 1996, the brand's first European location opened in Scotland. Marketing Starting in 1998, Holiday Inn Express started an ad campaign called \\"Stay Smart\\" ads that featured ordinary people achieving superior feats, such as averting a nuclear disaster or performing like rock stars. When questioned on whether or not they are professionals, they would attribute their skills to their stay there with the reply: \\"No, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night!\\" These ads have received positive reviews, and have been so successful they have crossed over into popular culture, having been featured in late night comedian jokes and political cartoons. Current ads feature comedian Rob Riggle. Properties Holiday Inn Express, Belmont, California Typical Holiday Inn Express hotels are built from corporate architectural prototypes, and tend to consist of 60‚Äì80 rooms, with a mix of suites and standard rooms in North American properties. Because the chain has been undergoing tremendous growth, the majority of Holiday Inn Express hotels are brand new or newly renovated. The original Holiday Inn Express properties were no-frills hotels with rooms comparable in quality to those of an upscale hotel, but there would be no room service, swimming pool, restaurant, bar, health club, meeting facilities or other on-site amenities, offering only continental breakfast and an exercise room. However newer Holiday Inn Express do feature most amenities from the higher-end Holiday Inn brand, such as a restaurant and bar, conference rooms, and even a full fitness center with a swimming pool. A major differentiation is location, with Express properties typically found in suburbs and besides freeways, while the upmarket Holiday Inn has been placed in urban areas (including downtown) and often near tourist attractions.

The objective is to provide long-term, segregated housing for inmates classified as the highest security risks in the prison system (the \\"worst of the worst\\" criminals) and those who pose an extremely serious threat to both national and global security.  Characteristics and practices  According to the National Institute of Corrections, an agency of the United States government, \\"a supermax is a stand-alone unit or part of another facility and is designated for violent or disruptive inmates. It typically involves up to 23-hour-per-day, single-cell confinement for an indefinite period of time. Inmates in supermax housing have minimal contact with staff and other inmates,\\" a definition confirmed by a majority of prison wardens.Daniel P. Mears, \\"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Supermax Prisons\\", Urban Institute, March 2006. In 2001, academics Leena Kurki and Norval Morris wrote that there was no universal, agreed upon definition for \\"supermax\\" and that prisons are classified inconsistently. They identified four general features of supermax prisons: # Long-term: once transferred to a supermax prison, prisoners tend to stay there for several years or indefinitely. # Powerful administration: supermax administrators and correctional officers have ample authority to punish and manage inmates, without outside review or prisoner grievance systems. # Solitary confinement: supermax prisons rely heavily on intensive (and long-term) solitary confinement, which is used to isolate and punish prisoners as well as to protect them from themselves and each other. Communication with outsiders is minimal to none. # Very limited activities: few opportunities are provided for recreation, education, substance abuse programs, or other activities generally considered healthy and rehabilitative at other prisons. Prisoners are placed not as a punishment of their crimes but by their previous history when incarcerated or based on reliable evidence of an impending disruption. For example, this could be a prisoner who is a gang leader or planning a radical movement. These decisions are made as administrative protection measures and the prisoners in a supermax are deemed by correctional workers as a threat to the safety and security of the institution itself. The amount of inmate programming varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions provide entertainment for their inmates in the form of television, educational and self-help programs. Others provide instructors who speak to inmates through the cell door. Some jurisdictions provide no programming to its inmates. In a supermax, prisoners are generally allowed out of their cells for only one hour a day (one-and-a-half hours in California state prisons). Exercise is done in indoor spaces or small, secure, outdoor spaces, usually alone or in a pair and always watched by the guard. Group exercise is offered only to those who are in transition programs. Inmates receive their meals through ports in the doors of their cells.Shalev, S. (2009) Supermax: controlling risk by solitary confinement. Cullompton: Willan Publishing. Prisoners are under constant surveillance, usually with closed-circuit television cameras. Cell doors are usually opaque, while the cells may be windowless. Furnishings are plain, with poured concrete or metal furniture common. Cell walls, and sometimes plumbing, may be soundproofed to prevent communication between the inmates.  History = Australia  An early form of supermax-style prison unit appeared in Australia in 1975, when \\"Katingal\\" was built inside the Long Bay Correctional Centre in Sydney. Dubbed the \\"electronic zoo\\" by inmates, Katingal was a super-maximum security prison block with 40 prison cells having electronically operated doors, surveillance cameras, and no windows. It was closed down two years later over human rights concerns. Since then, some maximum-security prisons have gone to full lockdown as well, while others have been built and dedicated to the supermax standard. In September 2001, the Australian state of New South Wales opened a facility in the Goulburn Correctional Centre to the supermax standard. While its condition is an improvement over that of Katingal of the 1970s, this new facility is nonetheless designed on the same principle of sensory deprivation. It has been set up for 'AA' prisoners who have been deemed a risk to public safety and the instruments of government and civil order or are believed to be beyond rehabilitation. Corrections Victoria in the state of Victoria also operates the Acacia and Melaleuca units at Barwon Prison which serve to hold the prisoners requiring the highest security in that state including Melbourne Gangland figures such as Tony Mokbel, and Carl Williams, who was murdered in the Acacia unit in 2010.  Brazil  In 1985, the state government of S√£o Paulo created an annex to a psychiatric penitentiary hospital meant to house the most violent inmates of the region and established the Penitentiary of Rehabilitation Center of Taubat√©, also known as Piranh√£o. Previously, high- risk inmates were housed at a prison on Anchieta Island; however, that closed down after a bloody massacre. At Taubat√©, inmates spent 23 hours of a day in solitary confinement and spent 30 minutes a day with a small group of seven to ten inmates. Ill-treatment of inmates occurred on a daily basis, causing major psychological impairment. Throughout the 1990s, and the early-2000s, Brazil faced major challenges with gang structures within its prisons. The gang Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) gained notoriety in the prison system and had new members joining within the prisons. Riots were a common occurrence and the gang culture became uncontrollable, leading authorities to pass the controversial Regime Disciplinar Diferenciado (RDD), a culture founded from disciplinary punishment.  United Kingdom  Britain's Her Majesty's Prison Service in England and Wales has had a long history in controlling prisoners that are high-risk. Prisoners are categorized into four main classifications (A, B, C, D) with A being \\"highly dangerous\\" with a high risk of escaping to category D in which inmates \\"can be reasonably trusted in open conditions.\\" The British government formed the Control Review Committee in 1984 to allow for regulating long-term disruptive prisoners. The committee proposed special units (called CRC units) which were formally introduced in 1989 to control for highly-disruptive prisoners to be successfully reintegrated. Yet a series of escapes, riots, and investigations by authorities saw the units come to a close in 1998. They would soon be replaced by Close Supervision Centres (CSC), which was meant to provide relief for long-term prisons which are still used in the present day. It was reported to hold 60 of the most dangerous men in the UK in 2015.  United States  Alcatraz Island is a historical prototype of the supermax prison standard. The United States Penitentiary Alcatraz Island, opened in 1934, has been considered a prototype and early standard for a supermax prison.Carlson, Peter M.; Garrett, Judith Simon, Prison and Jail Administration: Practice and Theory, Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 1999. Cf. Chapter 35, p.252, \\"Supermaximum Facilities\\", by David A. Ward. A push for supermax prisons began in 1983, after two correctional officers, Merle Clutts and Robert Hoffman, were stabbed to death by inmates at Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. Norman Carlson, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, argued for a new type of prison to isolate uncontrollable inmates who \\"show absolutely no concern for human life\\". USP Marion became the first \\"supermax\\" prison where inmates were isolated for 23 hours in their cells. By 1999, the United States contained at least 57 supermax facilities, spread across 30‚Äì34 states.Leena Kurki and Norval Morris, \\"The Purposes, Practices, and Problems of Supermax Prisons\\", Crime and Justice 28, 2001; accessed via JStor. In recent years a number of U.S. states have downgraded their supermax prisons, as has been done with Wallens Ridge State Prison, a former supermax prison in Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Other supermax prisons that have gained notoriety for their harsh conditions and attendant litigation by inmates and advocates are the former Boscobel (in Wisconsin), now named the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility, Red Onion State Prison (in western Virginia, the twin to Wallens Ridge State Prison), Tamms (in Illinois), and the Ohio State Penitentiary. Placement policies at the Ohio facility were the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court case (Wilkinson v. Austin) in 2005Wilkinson v. Austin 04-495 (2005), Link to case text where the Court decided that there had to be some, but only very limited, due process involved in supermax placement. There is only one supermax prison remaining in the U.S federal prisonsystem, ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. It houses numerous inmates who have a history of violent behavior in other prisons, with the goal of moving them from solitary confinement (up to 23 hours a day) to a less restrictive prison within three years. However, it is best known for housing several inmates who have been deemed either too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. They include several prisoners convicted of domestic and international terrorism, such Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who perpetrated the Oklahoma City Bombing; Richard Reid and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who separately attempted to detonate explosives on a commercial airplane flight; Theodore Kaczynski (\\"Unabomber\\"), who carried out a campaign of mail bombs; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Other notable inmates include Robert Hanssen, convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union and El Chapo, a Mexican drug lord convicted in 2019. However, many states now have created supermax prisons, either as stand-alone facilities or as secure units within lower-security prisons.Riveland, C. (1999) Supermax prisons: overview and general considerations. Washington D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Corrections State supermax prisons include Pelican Bay in California and Tamms in Illinois. In 2006, USP Marion, the original model for the modern supermax prison, was downgraded to a medium- security prison. The California State Prison, Corcoran (COR) is a hybrid model, incorporating a supermax partition, housing or having housed high- security prisoners such as Charles Manson.  Cost-benefit analysis of supermax prisons  There is no set definition of a supermax prison; however, the United States Department of Justice and the National Institute of Corrections agree that \\"these units have basically the same function: to provide long-term, segregated housing for inmates classified as the highest security risks in a state‚Äôs prison system.\\" When making comparisons between supermax prisons and non-supermax prisons, a clear and consistent definition is crucial. As a result, applying one definition to \\"supermax housing\\" across all states and jurisdictions is very important. Things to consider include types of prisoners, facility conditions and the purpose of the facility is important to the analysis. Consequently, it is hard to provide a cost-benefit analysis with varying facilities across the board. In these cases, a cost- benefit analysis would be beneficial in the decision to construct a facility, upgrade an existing facility, or determine whether a facility should be closed down.  Costs of operating a supermax prison  Building a supermax prison, or even retrofitting an old prison, is very expensive. Construction of ADX Florence cost $60 million and opened in 1994. Compared to a maximum security facility, supermax prisons are extremely expensive to run and can cost about three times more on average.Mears, Daniel P. \\"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Super max Prisons.\\" PsycEXTRA Dataset (2006): n. pag. NCJRS, Jan. 2006. Web. 22 November 2015. The 1999 average annual cost for inmates at Colorado State Penitentiary, a supermax facility, was $32,383. Compared with the maximum- security prison, the Colorado Correctional Center's annual inmate cost was $18,549. This is mainly due to the technology needed to further maintain a supermax: high-security doors, fortified walls, and sophisticated electronic systems. There are higher costs for staffing these facilities because more people must be hired to maintain the buildings and facilities. These costs are paid by taxpayers and depend on the jurisdiction of the prison. Federal prisons are provided for by federal taxes, while state prisons are provided for by the state. Furthermore, there are many costs that are harder to measure. Supermax facilities have had a history of psychological and mental health issues to their inmates. These psychological problems present an additional layer of burden to society. Additional costs to society are incurred when inmates have a hard time readjusting to normal life after release, and inmates may even be more inclined to commit even worse offenses to society.  Controversy  Supermax and Security Housing Unit (SHU) prisons are controversial. One criticism is that the living conditions in such facilities violate the United States Constitution, specifically, the Eighth Amendment's proscription against \\"cruel and unusual\\" punishments.PrisonActivist.org ‚Äì California's Security Housing Units. In 1996, a United Nations team assigned to investigate torture described SHU conditions as \\"inhuman and degrading\\".Paglen.com ‚Äì Security Housing Unit A 2011 New York Bar association comprehensive study suggested that supermax prisons constitute \\"torture under international law\\" and \\"cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution\\". ‚Äì The Brutality of Supermax Confinement In 2012, a federal class action suit against the Federal Bureau of Prisons and officials who run ADX Florence SHU (Bacote v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, Civil Action 1:12-cv-01570) alleged chronic abuse, failure to properly diagnose prisoners, and neglect of prisoners who are seriously mentally ill. The suit was dismissed.Cohen, Andrew (18 June 2012) An American Gulag: Descending into Madness at Supermax The Atlantic, Retrieved 20 June 2012  Prisons with supermax facilities = North America  Canada = * Special Handling Unit (Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec) ‚Äì Houses Canada's most dangerous and violent inmates = Mexico = * Penal del Altiplano ‚Äì Almoloya de Juarez, State of Mexico.

Since its inception, the following prisons were prepared for the housing of RDD inmates: * Centro de Readapta√ß√£o Provis√≥ria de Presidente Bernardes (Presidente Bernardes, S√£o Paulo, Brazil) ‚Äì inspired by the supermax standards, although prisoners can only stay there for a maximum of 2 years.

It is the first federal prison in Brazil, designed to receive prisoners deemed too dangerous to be kept in the states' prison systems (in Brazil, ordinarily, both convicts sentenced by States' courts or by the Federal Judiciary fulfill their prison terms in state-run prisons; the Federal Prison System was created to handle only the most dangerous prisoners in Brazil, such as major drug lords, convicted either by the Federal Judiciary or by the judiciary of a state). * Penitenci√°ria Federal de Campo Grande (Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil) ‚Äì the second of two Brazilian Federal prisons based on the supermax specifications. = Colombia = * Penitenciar√≠a de C√≥mbita (Colombia) ‚Äì follows supermax specifications, hosts terrorists and drug lords. * Establecimiento Penitenciario de Alta y Mediana Seguridad de Gir√≥n EPAMSGIRON.

He is also the co-founder of the metal bands Divine Heresy and Asesino. He also popularized the use of digital amp modelling processors for seven and eight string guitars in metal music. Cazares was a co-founding member of super-group Brujeria. Biography Cazares was born in El Centro, California on September 2, 1966. Cazares met singer Burton C. Bell in 1989 and started a group under the name Ulceration, which was renamed to their current name Fear Factory in the following year with Raymond Herrera on drums. The band's first album, Soul of a New Machine, was dedicated to Cazares' mother, Natividad, and older brother, Joey. Before starting Fear Factory, Cazares was in the grindcore band Excruciating Terror, which he quit after one month. He co-founded the Mexican death/grind side-project Brujeria, formed in 1989 with members of Faith No More, Fear Factory, among other well-known bands. When Fear Factory split up (temporarily) in 2002, Cazares returned to Brujeria, and released what was supposed to be the first of 13 Demoniaco Brujeria records (one for each member of Brujeria). He formed the band Asesino the same year, it featured himself with Static-X bassist Tony Campos on bass and vocals, and Emilio Marquez on drums. Fear Factory reformed later that year without Cazares. In 2005, Cazares was chosen as a team captain by Roadrunner A&R; Monte Conner for the Roadrunner United album for which he wrote 4 songs and contributed with other Roadrunner Records artists. Cazares formed Divine Heresy in 2005, who released their debut album Bleed the Fifth in August 2007. The band got signed to Roadrunner Records and Century Media, and included Tim Yeung (All That Remains, Hate Eternal, Nile, Vital Remains, Morbid Angel) on drums, Thomas Cummings on vocals and (later on) Joe Payne (Nile) on bass. Cummings was terminated from the band in 2008 and was replaced by Travis Neal. Their second album Bringer of Plagues was released on July 28, 2009. In 2009, Cazares rejoined Fear Factory and has released 3 albums with them since. Divine Heresy has been inactive due to Cazares' commitment to Fear Factory and several departures that took place. Cazares has voiced a minor character in the adult swim TV show Metalocalypse. In January 2019 Cazares announced his divorce from Jennifer Pagan Cazares on Twitter. Reformation of Fear Factory On April 7, 2009, Cazares and ex-bandmate Burton C. Bell announced the reconciliation of their friendship, and the formation of a new project with Byron Stroud (Strapping Young Lad) on bass and Gene Hoglan (Death, Strapping Young Lad, Dethklok) on drums. On April 28, this project was revealed to actually be a new version of Fear Factory, minus founding member Raymond Herrera and longtime member Christian Olde Wolbers. Bell, when asked why Herrera and Wolbers were not included, stated that \\"Fear Factory's like a business and I'm just reorganizing...We won't talk about [their exclusion].\\" Technique and style Cazares is often identified by his fast alternate picking rhythm guitar technique, timing palm muted triplets and syncopated sixteenth notes with double bass drumming. This has led to a distinctive \\"machine-gun\\" style identifiable in the music of Fear Factory. In previous Fear Factory albums, Cazares did not play any guitar solos in Fear Factory for stylistic reasons, but can be heard playing them in his other bands. However, the band's 2010 album, Mechanize, has several lead parts and solos. Equipment Dino Cazares currently endorses Ormsby Guitars, a company based in Perth, Australia. He announced the partnership in January 2019, as well as a line of signature models, two of these being revealed at the 2019 Winter NAMM Show. Cazares' main guitars in Fear Factory were previously custom-made 7-string Ibanez models with Seymour Duncan Blackouts pickups installed, usually detuned a whole step (A,D,G,C,F,A,D; from Obsolete on) to allow for even lower registers. His main guitar in Asesino is an Ibanez prototype 8-string guitar (standard tuning with two extra basses: (F#,B,E,A,D,G,B, E) loaded with 2 Seymour Duncan Blackout 8 active pickups. Before using Ibanez guitars, his main instrument was a black custom shop ESP M 6-string guitar with a single EMG 81 in the bridge, detuned to B tuning. This can be seen in the video for the song \\"Replica\\". His first known Ibanez 7-string is an Ibanez Universe UV7SBK \\"Silver Dot\\", with a modified pick guard to fit a single passive pickup and a volume knob. He was also known to have an Ibanez Universe UV777BK with similar modifications, except with an EMG 7-string prototype instead of a passive pickup. In January 2015, Ibanez announced a signature model for Dino Cazares, the DCM100. It is based on the Ibanez RGD platform, including the 26.5 scale, but features a mahogany body, maple neck with bubinga strip, offset dot inlays, Lo-Pro Edge tremolo, and a single Seymour Duncan Retribution pickup. This guitar makes Cazares one of only 4 Ibanez signature artists to have a signature 7-string guitar. After 22 years with the company, Dino Cazares announced his departure from Ibanez in January 2019. In the early days, his guitar tone derived from a modified Marshall JCM800 head with scooped mids and high treble settings to produce the thrashy, chugging tone which has been so influential to the metal genre. After it was stolen, he switched to the Line 6 POD Pro with a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. This setup was used to record Digimortal. Currently with Fear Factory, Cazares endorsed the Line 6 Vetta II HD and POD X3 Pro processor with a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp with Mesa/Boogie oversized Rectifier 4x12 cabinets. When playing live, Cazares mostly uses the speaker cabinets for monitoring, or does not use them at all, since his signal is also run into the venue's PA. In 2011, Cazares replaced the POD X3 Pro for the most recent version, the POD HD Pro. He has also replaced his Mesa/Boogie tube power amp for a Matrix GT800FX 800W solid state power amp, and his Mesa/Boogie Rectifier 4x12 for a custom-built cabinet built by David Laboga. Sometime in 2012 or 2013, Cazares eventually switched from Line6 to Fractal Audio, making use of their Axe-FX II. This was short lived, as he would soon switch to using a Kemper Profiling Amp, an amplifier that could \\"profile\\" other guitar amps, allowing him to get a tone similar to previous albums. With Divine Heresy, he used an old Marshall Valvestate VS100 head, Marshall JCM800, and a Peavey 5150 head boosted with an Ibanez TS-9. In 2007, Cazares switched from EMG active pickups to Seymour Duncan AHB-1 Blackout active pickups, which he helped design with Duncan. In 2014, Seymour Duncan announce the Blackout Retribution pickups, which were a signature set of pickups designed with less output and more treble than a standard Blackout set.

This training was in the Veenai Dhanammal style, a style of Carnatic Music known for its unhurried, alluring movements, as also for its use of intricate gamakas (graces) in the handling of ragas (modes). Additionally, Brinda trained for a substantial length of time under Kanchipuram Naina Pillai, whose style of music was marked by agility and robustness in laya (rhythm). After her training under Naina Pillai, Brinda learnt from her aunt Lakshmiratnam. Veenai Dhanammal, who was also Brinda's grandmother, herself taught her some compositions. She rendered ragas that featured complex patterns and subtle gamakas, such as Begada, Mukhari, Sahana, Suruti, Varali and Yadukulakambhoji. She was a repository of Kshetrayya padams and javalis (romantic compositions rich in musical content) and many rare compositions of the Trinity of Carnatic Music and Patnam Subramania Iyer. Many talented and popular musicians were attracted by Brinda's musical scholarship and expertise, and trained under her. Carnatic Musicians such as Sangeetha Kalanidhis Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M.S. Subbulakshmi and R K Srikanthan have learnt from her. The musicians Ramnad Krishnan, Aruna Sairam, Chitravina Ravikiran, B. Krishnamoorthy, Chitravina Ganesh, K.N. Shashikiran, Kiranavali Vidyasankar, Geetha Raja and B. Balasubrahmaniyan have been Brinda's full-time students. Her grandson and direct disciple Thiruvarur S. Girish is also an accomplished Carnatic musician. In her earlier years, Brinda performed extensively with her younger sister, T. Muktha and in her later years, with her daughter Vegavahini Vijayaraghavan. Brinda did not wish to record commercially, hence only private recordings of her performances are available.

The rotational barrier for a push-pull olefin is lower than that of an ordinary olefin and this makes it an interesting candidate for a molecular switch for instance azobenzenes. A push-pull configuration also helps to stabilize the double bond because the carbon-carbon bond has considerably less double bond character. For instance cyclobutadiene is a very unstable molecule but with both olefinic bonds in push-pull configuration (two ester substituents and two tertiary amine substituents) the molecule is stable indeed.

A three-part finale was serialized in Monthly Comic Ry≈´ in 2007. A four-episode OVA adaptation by AIC tones down the explicit sexual content and deviates entirely from the manga storyline and setting.  Manga Plot  In the near future, a secret society, Nematoda, with ambitions of world domination, hired three men, Professor Akitsu, Professor Himuro, and Professor Wakatsuki, to build the ultimate \\"G-Class\\" giant robot, Zeorymer. Nearly two decades later, on his deathbed, Professor Akitsu tells his son, Masaki Akitsu, that Zeorymer must not awaken. A short time later, a new student transfers into Masaki's school, named Miku Himuro. She quickly persuades him to meet her adopted father, Professor Himuro, and Masaki is curious to find out what is going on, and what his father meant in his final words. Traveling by a high-speed pod hidden under the city, he meets Professor Himuro in a vast underground facility. Nematoda's General Golshid, aware of the Himuro's appearance in Japan, send a G-Class robot to assault their base and kill them, as they believed they had the only \\"Joint\\". Himuro compels Masaki to pilot Zeorymer and save them, as he is the only one that can pilot it. Once he agrees, Himuro and his daughter head to an operating room without Masato's knowledge, and he installs a sphere called a \\"Dimensional Joint\\" - a flawed duplicate of the original - into his daughter's womb, and she is teleported to within Zeorymer's \\"eye\\". This is necessary to utilise Zeorymer's true abilities - without them, it is simply an outdated G-Class robot. Though Masaki stumbles with the unfamiliar systems, Zeorymer eventually awakens fully, Masaki undergoes a strange and short-lived shift in personality, and with the spherical energy weapon on the back of Zeorymer's hand, destroys its opponent in a single attack. Soon, Nematoda sends its three newest and most powerful robots after Zeorymer. Finding its pilots at school, they attempt to apprehend them, but Zeorymer is teleported to their location. Masaki's personality shifts again, and Zeorymer fights the three, despite being in the middle of a city, showing no care for civilian casualties. Zeorymer shows its power, being much faster than the fastest of the three, vastly stronger than the strongest of the three, and takes the many, many missiles of the third without damage. Finally, Zeorymer activates both of the spheres on the back of its hands and taps them together, the shockwave cleaving the final robot and several buildings behind it in two. As a result, the city has undergone immense damage, and many of its citizens are surely killed, including all of their schoolmates. With Nematoda, General Golshid, seeing the vast power of Zeorymer, elects to pilot the powerful Rose C'est La Vie, a G-Class robot that had crippled test pilots, even at less than full power. Knowing he has little choice Golshid still elects to go, with Rose C'est La Vie at full power. Upon returning to base, Professor Himuro is shown to have collapsed and is dying of an incurable disease, and Masato realised the level of destruction fighting would cause, but strangely didn't care. Suddenly teleported to Zeorymer's cockpit, it's revealed that Masaki is the revived, evil, Professor Wakatsuki, reduced to an embryo and reborn to escape an inevitable death, Miku was Himuro's wife, who had been cheating on her husband with him, had undergone the same process as she had been caught in the same event, and that Himuro was the one to attempt to kill them. Though the three scientists were conspiring against Nematoda while they worked for the organisation, Wakatsuki was planning to betray the others and take Zeorymer for himself. Akitsu and Himuro had stolen the embryos to stop the revival, and Akitsu then took Masaki's embryo and fled from his other colleague as well. However, by activating Zeorymer, the memories and personality of Wakatsuki had been installed into Masaki, though the same was not true of Miku. Following this reveal, Wakatsuki forces himself on Miku, sexually, and uses sex to make her his. Rose C'est La Vie lands and fights Zeorymer. Golshid successfully tears off one of Zeorymer's arms, but it is instantly regenerated in its entirety. He then successfully destroys its cockpit, killing Wakatsuki, to which both cockpit and pilot are regenerated completely. Defeated and nearly destroyed, Golshid is saved by the sudden loss of power of Zeorymer, as the Dimensional Joint had finally failed. With both robots retreating, Wakatsuki installs a new Dimensional Joint into Miku, and upon her awakening, suddenly shifts back to Masaki for a moment. With both Wakatsuki and Miku realising, Wakatsuki reinforces himself and flees. In the midst of coitus with Miku, Masaki comes to the realisation that the \\"fake Masaki Akitsu\\" was not a fake - it was not Wakatsuki's personality that was installed, just his memories. While that would be enough for a child without memories to become a \\"true\\" Masaki Wakatsuki, Masaki Akitsu's personality was too strong, and he eventually came to the realisation that he was simply being dragged along by how he thought he should be acting, thanks to Wakatsuki's memories, with Professor Himuro secretly watching. Deep in the base, Himura hovers over a switch, which would destroy the flawed Dimensional Joint in Miku's womb, killing both Miku and Masaki, but accepts that Masaki is not really Wakatsuki, and Miku is not his deceitful wife, feels guilt for considering Miku to only be a tool, and dies of his sickness. Upon finding him, Masaki decides that the only way to escape Zeorymer is by burying it himself, and decides to do so by attacking Nematoda's main base. Arriving at Nematoda's base, Zeorymer's landing destroys many of its defending machines with the resulting shockwave, and makes short work of the remainder. Suddenly, the president of Nematoda appears, piloting a black Zeorymer, powered by the original Dimensional Fault installed into an \\"inhuman\\" Miku clone, revealing himself to be a second backup of Wakatsuki, but one with advanced aging thanks to the destruction left by the theft of the original Zeorymer affecting his regeneration. After the theft, he had killed the Nematoda president and taken his place. Fighting with Zeorymer and showing that they had equally powerful offensive and regeneration abilities, the two Zeorymer grappled and began to merge. Revealing that Zeorymer's power source was in another dimension, and that as a result, there can only be one Zeorymer, which was the reason that even Masaki couldn't make a perfect Dimensional Joint, despite having Wakatsuki's memories, the two machines merged into one, with the fake Miku collapsing, the original Dimensional Joint installing itself into Miku's womb, and Wakatsuki planning to take over Masaki's body in the process. Though Zeorymer is merged into a half-black, half-white version, Masaki, Miku and Wakatsuki were ejected from it. Wakatsuki fails to understand why, but Masaki enlightens him - Zeorymer reformatted its pilot registry when Masaki started piloting Zeorymer, and was installed with Wakatsuki's memories. Thus, Zeorymer couldn't install Wakatsuki's personality into Masaki's body. Wakatsuki's driven somewhat mad, reveals that he also has a self-destruct for the Joint in Miku's womb, but is shot and killed by Golshid, furious at Wakatsuki's murder of the original Nematoda president. However, there's a massive Deuterium Bomb under the Nematoda base, activated by Wakatsuki's death, which is large enough to destroy the world. However, Zeorymer is strong enough to survive. Rather than escaping, Masaki and Miku plan to absorb all the energy from the bomb's detonation into Zeorymer and into the other dimension. Golshid's expectation is that even Zeorymer will be destroyed, but Masaki says that he and Miku want to live, in this world that they grew up in. As they attempt it, Golshid is shown to have escaped in a pod. Though Masato and Miku succeed, the manga concludes by saying that no-one ever saw the G-Class Robot \\"Hades\\" ever again.  Anime Plot  Set in the near future, a secret feudal monarchy led by an empress and named uses, as a front, a firm 'International Electronic Brains' and has built a set of eight giant robots, each possessing a power based upon the eight elements of earth, fire, water, air, thunder, mountains, the moon and the heavens. However, one of them, Zeorymer of the Heavens, has been stolen and the main character, fifteen-year-old Masato Akitsu, is forced into piloting it with a mysterious girl named Miku Himuro. Zeorymer possesses an energy based weapon called the \\"Dimensional Coupler Cannon\\" that appears almost telekinetic in nature; by holding its fist in the air, or aiming it at a target, energy strobes across the orb and causes a large explosion to engulf whatever enemy it is directed against. These orbs can also fire beams of golden-hued energy (labeled as the Energy Wave attack) which can cause massive damage, and project a forcefield which seems nearly impenetrable. The robot itself is also incredibly durable: in the third episode, it was struck with a weapon that left an effect similar to that of a nuclear warhead, yet suffered only minimal damage. Zeorymer of the Heavens is able to hover, fly, teleport unspecified distances, and possesses an incredibly potent weapon known as the : when it lifts its arms in the air then lowers them across its chest, slamming its fists together or against the large golden orb on its chest, the robot releases a huge blast of golden energy that, at full power, can cause an explosion visible from space (inferring the power of several gigatons at least, though even on lower settings this final weapon seems equal to most nuclear weapons in scale). When this attack is activated, a mysterious voice, possibly Zeorymer's itself, can be heard saying \\"Meiou,\\" the attack's name. The first of the seven remaining Hau Dragon robots Zeorymer faces is the air- based robot known as Lanstar of the Winds, piloted by Taiha, the lover of Hau Dragon ruler Yuratei. Lanstar is smaller in build but slimmer than Zeorymer, denoting less overall protection but seeming to exhibit greater speed and agility, though they appear to be the same height. Lanstar of the Winds has a pair of huge mechanical wings on its back which seem to be the source of its powers, which are focused around creating and controlling intense air currents. To this end it can generate, at will, \\"sharp\\" planes of wind, tornadoes, or even release its signature Dead Long Fuun attack wherein Lanstar projects four streams of incredibly intense air currents that combine into the shape of a serpentine dragon. This intense wind blast creates a vortex of wind so powerful when it strikes a target that it was easily capable of stripping stone and earth from the ground and even causing some damage to Zeorymer's armor. The second and third robots encountered by Zeorymer were Breist of the Fire and Gallowin of the Water. They were piloted by two identical twins, who seemed to despise one another, much like water repels fire, though it is the \\"fire\\" sister Shi-Aen who is more level-headed and controlled while her \\"water\\" sister Shi-Tau is hotheaded and untamed. Both Briest and Gallowin possessed what appeared to be several unspecified energy weapons - most of which were left unnamed - though they boasted two incredibly powerful combo attacks: Twin Lords and Twin Flare. The former had them use their primary weapons (Gallowin's twin particle beams, the Beam Searchers, and Briest's shoulder mounted Magna Flares) which are fired at one another. When they impact they result in what can only be described as a huge nuclear detonation capable of tremendous damage; next to Zeorymer's final attack it is one of the most powerful seen in the series. The latter attack, Twin Flare, is when the two robots link into one another and form twin beam cannons which, while powerful, pales in comparison to the Twin Lords attack. The fourth Hau Dragon robot to attack was Rose C'est La Vie of the Moon, who was piloted by Ritsu, an asexual man who hid his woman-like face behind a steel mask. Rose C'est La Vie was among the most powerful single combatants ever seen in the series and was easily the most powerful Hau Dragon robot besides Zeorymer of the Heavens itself. Rose C'est La Vie was literally loaded with weapons: his chest contained four beam cannons, one beam cannon was hidden in each leg, each of its ten fingers could fire a beam of energy, and when all ten on each hand were combined they formed the Moon Beam Swords, twin energy blades powerful enough to cut through seemingly anything. Finally Rose C'est La Vie possessed a weapon which rivaled even Zeorymer's final attack, known as the J-Kaiser. Parts of Rose C'est La Vie's armor would disconnect and form a gargantuan energy cannon, and three small pods were launched into orbit. They would beam energy down to Rose C'est La Vie, which would project it out as a blast of energy from the J-Kaiser cannon so powerful it left huge craters in the ground and could even shoot a hole through mountains After three failed attempts to destroy Zeorymer, Yuratei finally dispatched her last three remaining robots: Omzack of the Thunder, Dinodilos of the Earth, and Burrstone of the Mountains, piloted by Saiga, Rokfel, and Giso respectively. Giso seemed to have strong feelings for Rokfel, but she seemed to have similar feelings for Saiga. Saiga was, in turn, a sociopathic man who cared for little other than proving himself the most powerful of all and boasted that his robot Omzack was the strongest Hau Dragon machine ever, which would later end ironically for him. Their three robots were only featured briefly in the fourth and final episode and so they were not well understood, though some things were made clear: Burrstone was a heavy support robot who mounted over five hundred missiles in various launchers, ranging from normal cruise missiles and guided weapons to hugely powerful atomic bombs capable of destroying several miles of landscape, and also seemed to be incredibly well-armored with huge plates covering its entire body. Dinodilos's powers were ill-defined but it appeared have the ability to, by inserting its huge arms into the ground, control underground magma flows causing geysers of magma and huge earthquakes, and could also have limited control over earth itself. Omzack's powers, despite Saiga's boasts, are in fact never fully shown; while it handily destroyed an entire carrier group in a single massive explosion and was said to possess the \\"photon lightning system\\", Omzack of the Thunder proved an utter failure in battle because of Saiga's overconfidence and short sightedness. The Hau Dragon possessed at least one other mecha - their own flying fortress - but it seemed to be rather helpless without the seven robots to defend it.

Because the wing tip shape influences the size and drag of the wingtip vortices, tip design has produced a diversity of shapes, including: * Squared-off * Aluminium tube bow * Rounded * Hoerner style * Winglets * Drooped tips * Raked wingtips * Tip tanks * Sails * Fences * End plates Winglets have become popular additions to high speed aircraft to increase fuel efficiency by reducing drag from wingtip vortices. In lower speed aircraft, the effect of the wingtip shape is less apparent, with only a marginal performance difference between round, square, and Hoerner style tips The slowest speed aircraft, STOL aircraft, may use wingtips to shape airflow for controlability at low airspeeds. Wing tips are also an expression of aircraft design style, so their shape may be influenced by marketing considerations as well as by aerodynamic requirements. Wing tips are often used by aircraft designers to mount navigation lights, anti-collision strobe lights, landing lights, handholds, and identification markings. Wing tip tanks can act as a winglet and distribute weight more evenly across the wing spar. On fighter aircraft, they may also be fitted with hardpoints, for mounting drop tanks and weapons systems, such as missiles and electronic countermeasures. Wingtip mounted hose/drogue systems allow Aerial refueling of multiple aircraft with separation. Aerobatic aircraft use wingtip mounted crosses for visual attitude reference. Wingtip mounted smoke systems and fireworks highlight rolling aerobatic maneuvers. Some airshow acts feature the pilot touching or dragging the wingtip along the ground. Aircraft with a single main landing gear or very high aspect ratio wings such as gliders, may place small landing gear in the wingtips. Some uncommon designs, like the Rutan Quickie, and Convair XFY placed the main landing gear in the wingtips. Some early World War I aircraft used wooded skids on the wingtips to minimize damage on ground looping incidents. Several amphibious aircraft such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina, use retractable wingtips as floats. Moveable wingtips can affect the controlability of a wing. Wing warping the ends of the wing, produced roll control on the earliest of aircraft such as the Wright Flyer. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie raised and lowered its wingtips in flight to adjust its stability in supersonic and subsonic flight. Wingtips can also house the power plant or thrust of an aircraft. The EWR VJ 101 used tip mounted jets, the V-22 uses tilting wingtip mounted engines, and the Harrier uses wingtip thrust for stability while hovering. Rotary wing aircraft wingtips may be swept or curved to reduce noise and vibration. Some rotary wing aircraft place their propulsion in wingtip tip jets.  Folding wingtips  The Boeing 777X will feature 3.5 m (11 ft) folding wingtips supplied by Liebherr Aerospace from Lindenberg. The mechanism was demonstrated for Aviation Week at the Boeing Everett Factory in October 2016. The folding takes 20 seconds to complete.

As USS McLanahan Named for Tenant McLanahan, McLanahan was laid down on 20 April 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, and was launched on 22 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Charles M. Howe. The destroyer was commissioned on 5 April 1919, Commander R. B. Coffey in command. After shakedown off the Massachusetts coast, McLanahan was assigned to the Pacific Fleet. At San Diego, California in October 1919 she was placed in reserve and decommissioned in June 1922. She remained at San Diego until recommissioning 18 December 1939. Then, following overhaul and fitting out, she steamed to the east coast. On 8 October 1940 she decommissioned as a U.S. Navy ship at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and commissioned in the Royal Navy, under the terms of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, as Bradford (H72). As HMS Bradford HMS Bradford was modified for long range trade convoy escort service by removal of the two forward boilers and substitution of additional fuel tanks. This modification improved endurance but reduced top speed to 25 knots.Lenton&Colledge; (1968) pp.92-94 Bradford performed escort duties in the Atlantic, including convoys to North Africa, for Operation Torch, from 1941 to 1943. On 3 May 1943 she was declared no longer fit for ocean escort work and was ordered decommissioned at Devonport. There, for the remainder of the war, she served as an accommodation ship. She was scrapped at Troon 19 June 1946.

They have their origins in Indian religions and have been adopted into East Asian religions via the spread of Buddhism. Preta is often translated into English as \\"hungry ghost\\" from the Chinese and Vietnamese adaptations. In early sources such as the Petavatthu, they are much more varied. The descriptions below apply mainly in this narrower context. The development of the concept of the preta started with just thinking that it was the soul and ghost of a person once they died, but later the concept developed into a transient state between death and obtaining karmic reincarnation in accordance with the person's fate. In order to pass into the cycle of karmic reincarnation, the deceased's family must engage in a variety of rituals and offerings to guide the suffering spirit into its next life. If the family does not engage in these funerary rites, which last for one year, the soul could remain suffering as a preta for the rest of eternity. Pretas are believed to have been false, corrupted, compulsive, deceitful, jealous or greedy people in a previous life. As a result of their karma, they are afflicted with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as cadavers or feces, though in more recent stories, it can be anything, however bizarre.Garuda Purana 2.7.92-95, 2.22.52-55 In addition to having insatiable hunger for an aversive item, pretas are said to have disturbing visions. Pretas and human beings occupy the same physical space and while humans looking at a river would see clear water, pretas see the same river flowing with an aversive substance, common examples of such visions include pus and filth. Through the belief and influence of Hinduism and Buddhism in much of Asia, preta figure prominently in the cultures of India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Names The Sanskrit term preta means \\"departed, deceased, a dead person\\", from pra-ita, literally \\"gone forth, departed\\". In Classical Sanskrit, the term refers to the spirit of any dead person, but especially before the obsequial rites are performed, but also more narrowly to a ghost or evil being.Monier Williams Online Dictionary The Sanskrit term was taken up in Buddhism to describe one of six possible states of rebirth. The Chinese term egui (), literally \\"starving ghost\\", is thus not a literal translation of the Sanskrit term. Description Pretas are invisible to the human eye, but some believe they can be discerned by humans in certain mental states. They are described as human-like, but with sunken, mummified skin, narrow limbs, enormously distended bellies and long, thin necks. This appearance is a metaphor for their mental situation: they have enormous appetites, signified by their gigantic bellies, but a very limited ability to satisfy those appetites, symbolized by their slender necks. Pretas are often depicted in Japanese art (particularly that from the Heian period) as emaciated human beings with bulging stomachs and inhumanly small mouths and throats. They are frequently shown licking up spilled water in temples or accompanied by demons representing their personal agony. Otherwise they may be shown as balls of smoke or fire. Pretas dwell in the waste and desert places of the earth, and vary in situation according to their past karma. Some of them can eat a little, but find it very difficult to find food or drink. Others can find food and drink, but find it very difficult to swallow. Others find that the food they eat seems to burst into flames as they swallow it. Others see something edible or drinkable and desire it but it withers or dries up before their eyes. As a result, they are always hungry. In addition to hunger, pretas suffer from immoderate heat and cold; they find that even the moon scorches them in the summer, while the sun freezes them in the winter. The types of suffering are specified into two main types of pretas, those that live collectively, and those that travel through space. Of the former, there are three subtypes, the first being pretas who suffer from external obscurations. These pretas suffer constant hunger, thirst or temperature insensitivity. The second type of pretas are those who suffer from internal obscurations, who have small mouths and large stomachs. Often, their mouths are so small that they cannot eat enough food to fill the large space in their stomachs and thus remain constantly hungry. The last of the three subtypes are pretas that suffer from specific obscurations like creatures who live on and eat their bodies. The other broad category of pretas that travel through time and space are always scared and have a tendency to inflict pain on others. The sufferings of the pretas often resemble those of the dwellers in hell, and the two types of being are easily confused. The simplest distinction is that beings in hell are confined to their subterranean world, while pretas are free to move about. Relations between pretas and humans A preta depicted during Kali Puja. Pretas are generally seen as little more than nuisances to mortals unless their longing is directed toward something vital, such as blood. However, in some traditions, pretas try to prevent others from satisfying their own desires by means of magic, illusions, or disguises. They can also turn invisible or change their faces to frighten mortals. Generally, however, pretas are seen as beings to be pitied. Thus, in some Buddhist monasteries, monks leave offerings of food, money, or flowers to them before meals. In addition, there are many festivals around Asia that commemorate the importance of hungry ghosts or pretas and such festivals exist in Tibetan Buddhist tradition as well as Chinese Taoist tradition. Countries such as China, Tibet, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and Malaysia engage in hungry ghost festivals, and in China this is usually on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month according to their calendar. Many rituals involve burning symbolized material possessions, such as paper Louis Vuitton bags, thus linking the concept of the preta with the deceased's materialism in their lifetime. Though many pretas or hungry ghosts cling to their material possessions during their human lifetime, some other ghosts represented in the festivals long for their loved ones during their human life. During the festivals, people offer food to the spirits and hope for blessings from their ancestors in return. Thus, the hungry ghost festivals commemorating the pretas are a natural part of some Asian cultures and are not limited to only Hindu or Buddhist belief systems. Hinduism In Hinduism pretas are very real beings. They are a form, a body consisting only of vƒÅyu (air) and aka≈õa (aether), two of the five great elements (classical elements) which constitutes a body on Earth (others being prithvƒ´ [earth], jala [water] and agni [fire]). There are other forms as per the karma or \\"actions\\" of previous lives where a soul takes birth in humanoid bodies with the absence of one to three elements. In Hinduism an Atma or soul/spirit is bound to take rebirth after death in a body composed of five or more elements. A soul in transient mode is pure and its existence is comparable to that of a deva (god) but in the last form of physical birth. The elements except aka≈õa as defined is the common constituent throughout the universe and the remaining four are common to the properties of the planets, stars and afterlife places such as the underworld. This is the reason that Pretas cannot eat or drink as the rest of the three elements are missing and no digestion or physical intake is possible for them. Pretas are crucial elements of Hindu culture, and there are a variety of very specific funerary rituals that the mourning family must engage in to guide the deceased spirit into its next cycle of karmic rebirth. Rice balls, which are said to symbolize the body of the deceased, are offered from the mourning family to the preta whose spirit is often symbolized by a clay mound somewhere in the house. These rice balls are offered in three sets of 16 over one year, which is the amount of time it takes for a preta to complete its transformation into its next phase of life. The rice balls are offered to the preta because in this transient state between cremation and rebirth, the preta is said to undergo intense physical suffering. The three stages are the impure sixteen, the middle sixteen and the highest sixteen that occur over the course of the mourning period. After the physical body of the deceased is cremated, the first six rice balls are offered to ghosts in general, while the next ten are offered specifically to the preta or the spirit of the person who just died. These ten rice balls are said to help the preta form its new body which is now the length of a forearm. During the second stage, sixteen rice balls are offered to the preta, as through each stage of grief it is believed that pretas become even hungrier. At the last and final stage, the preta is said to have a new body, four rice balls are offered and five spiritual leaders of Brahmans are fed so that they can symbolize digesting the sins of the deceased during their life. While there are specific steps that guide the preta into its new life, during the mourning process, the deceased's family must undergo a series of restrictions to assist the preta and ease its suffering. In Indian cultures, food and digestion is symbolic as it separates the food essential for digestion from the waste products, and thus the same logic is applied to sins of the deceased in their living relatives eating and digesting the symbolic rice balls. In engaging in these rituals, the chief mourner of the deceased individual is the symbolic representation of the spirit or preta. During the period of mourning, the chief mourner can only eat one meal a day for the first eleven days following the death, and also not sleep on a bed, engage in sexual activity or any personal grooming or hygiene practices. Buddhism In general in Buddhist tradition, a preta is considered one of the five forms of existence (Gods, humans, animals, ghosts and hell beings) once a person dies and is reborn. geta and holding a ch≈´gi, c. 12th century. In Japan, preta is translated as gaki (, \\"hungry ghost\\"), a borrowing from Middle Chinese ngaH kjw…®jX (, \\"hungry ghost\\"). Since 657, some Japanese Buddhists have observed a special day in mid-August to remember the gaki. Through such offerings and remembrances (segaki), it is believed that the hungry ghosts may be released from their torment. In the modern Japanese language, the word gaki is often used to mean spoiled child, or brat. In Thailand, pret () are hungry ghosts of the Buddhist tradition that have become part of the Thai folklore, but are described as being abnormally tall, and can emit very high-pitched sound with its tiny mouth, which could be heard only by a monk or a shaman. Many elders often tell their child not to swear or tell bad things at their parents, otherwise they will become Pret afterlife.Thai Ghosts (in Thai) In Sri Lankan culture, like in other Asian cultures, people are reborn as preta (per√©thaya) if they desired too much in their life where their large stomachs can never be fulfilled because they have a small mouth.

It was founded in 1876 by Fred Harvey to cater to the growing number of train passengers. When Harvey died in 1901, his family inherited 45 restaurants and 20 dining cars in 12 states.Harvey House Restaurants, Kansapedia, The Kansas Historical Society During World War II, Harvey Houses opened again to serve soldiers as they traveled in troop trains across the U.S. By 1968, when it was sold to Amfac, Inc.

Cajon summit and the Santa Fe Railroad, c. 1919. From a Fred Harvey Co. tourist brochure. The company traces its origins to the 1876 opening of three railroad eating houses located at Wallace, Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, and Hugo, Colorado, on the Kansas Pacific Railway.Fred Harvey Biography, Special Collections and Archives, Northern Arizona University, 2015. These caf√©s were opened by Fred Harvey, then a freight agent for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, who emigrated to the United States from London, England when he was 17 years old. The caf√© operation ended within a year, but Harvey had been convinced of the potential profits from providing a high quality food and service experience at railroad eating houses. His longtime employer, the Burlington Railroad, declined his offer of establishing a system-wide eating house operation at all railroad meal stops, but the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF;) subsequently contracted with Harvey for several eating houses on an experimental basis. Harvey began by taking over the 20-seat lunchroom at their Topeka, Kansas depot, which opened under his leadership in January 1876. In 1878, Harvey started the first of his eating house-hotel establishments along the AT&SF; tracks in Florence, Kansas. The rapid growth of the Harvey House chain soon followed, with the second eating house opening in Lakin, Kansas in 1879. Fred Harvey is credited with creating the first restaurant chain in the U.S. Harvey and his company also became leaders in promoting tourism in the American Southwest in the late 19th century. Harvey promoted the region by inspiring the Indian curio shop, as well as guided tours through the west, known as Indian Detours. The company and its employees, including the famous waitresses who came to be known as Harvey Girls, successfully brought new higher standards of both civility and dining to a region widely regarded in the era as \\"the Wild West\\". The popularity of the Harvey Girls grew even stronger in 1946 when Judy Garland starred in the film version of Samuel Hopkins Adams‚Äôs novel The Harvey Girls. Despite the decline of passenger train patronage in the U.S. in the 20th century with the advent of the automobile, the company survived and prospered, by marketing its services to the motoring public. After 1926, Harvey Cars were used in the provision of \\"Indian Detours\\" services offered from a number of Harvey hotel locations. Fred Harvey‚Äôs son Ford began the series of guided tours into the interior of the west. The company purchased a hotel in Santa Fe called La Fonda, and it became headquarters for the Indian Detours, led by guides called Couriers. The company continued to adjust to the trends. During World War II, Fred Harvey Houses reopened across the Southwest to feed American soldiers. In 1943, it is estimated that the Fred Harvey Company served more than one million meals each month in dining cars and Harvey Houses. In the late 1950s it operated, for the first 15 years, the then-new landmark Illinois Tollway \\"Oases\\" which were built above the Interstate 294 highway in the Chicago suburbs by Standard Oil of Indiana (Amoco). The Fred Harvey legacy was continued in the family until the death of a grandson in 1965. Portions of the Fred Harvey Company have continued to operate since 1968 as part of a larger hospitality industry conglomerate, Amfac, Inc. which became Xanterra Parks and Resorts in 2002.  Company Growth and Relationship with AT&SF;  The Hotel Casta√±eda, Las Vegas, New Mexico, as seen in 2007. An early mission revival style Harvey House (1899) and sister hotel to the Alvarado in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Before the inclusion of dining cars in passenger trains became common practice, a rail passenger's only option for meal service in transit was to patronize one of the roadhouses often located near the railroad's water stops. Fare typically consisted of nothing more than rancid meat, cold beans, and week-old coffee. If passengers lacked time for meals, they could purchase overpriced sandwiches and fruit on the train platform or the cars. Such poor conditions understandably discouraged many Americans from making the journey westward. The subsequent growth and development of the Fred Harvey Company was closely related to that of AT&SF.; Under the terms of an oral agreement, Harvey opened his first depot restaurant in Topeka, Kansas, in January 1876. Railroad officials and passengers alike were impressed with Fred Harvey's strict standards for high quality food and first class service. Before opening the Topeka restaurant, Harvey ordered entirely new silverware, stemware, and dishes. As a result, AT&SF; entered into subsequent contracts with Harvey wherein he was given unlimited funds to set up a series of what were dubbed \\"eating houses\\" along most of the route. At more prominent locations, these eating houses evolved into hotels, many of which survive today, such as La Posada in Winslow, Arizona. By the late 1880s, there was a Fred Harvey dining facility located every 100 miles along the AT&SF;, as the distance was equivalent to when trains needed to refuel and load water. AT&SF; agreed to convey fresh meat and produce free-of-charge to any Harvey House via its own private line of refrigerator cars, the Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch, and in them food was shipped from every corner of the U.S. There were often break-ins at the Houses or parked refrigerator cars for the food and ingredients, as they were fresher than other restaurants. The company maintained two dairy facilities (the larger of the two was situated in Las Vegas, New Mexico) to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of fresh milk. When dining cars began to appear on trains, AT&SF; contracted with the Fred Harvey Company to operate the food service on the diners, and all AT&SF; advertising proclaimed \\"Fred Harvey Meals All the Way\\". Harvey's meals were served in sumptuous portions that provided a good value for the traveling public; for instance, pies were cut into fourths, rather than sixths, which was the industry standard at the time. The first visitor to the Topeka restaurant was served a fourth of an apple pie, for example. The Harvey Company and AT&SF; established a series of signals that allowed the dining room staff to make the necessary preparations to feed an entire train in just thirty minutes. For example, the ‚Äòcup code‚Äô allowed the waitresses to easily see what drink had been ordered by way of how the cup was placed on the saucer. Harvey Houses served their meals on fine China and Irish linens. Fred Harvey, a fastidious innkeeper, set high standards for efficiency and cleanliness in his establishments, personally inspecting them as often as possible. It was said that nothing escaped his notice, and he was even known to completely overturn a poorly set table. Male customers were required to wear a coat and tie in many of Harvey's dining rooms. The Harvey Houses went on to serve meals to GIs traveling on troop trains during World War II. This mutually beneficial relationship, characterized as one of the most successful and influential business partnerships in the early American West, endured until 1968, when the Fred Harvey Company was sold to Amfac Inc., now Xanterra Resorts and Parks. Facilities and Grand Canyon Tourism Harvey House Restaurant at the former Frisco Depot in Hugo, Oklahoma For the Southwest, Harvey hired architects Charles Whittlesey and Louis Curtiss for influential landmark hotels in Santa Fe and Gallup, New Mexico. The Grand Canyon was the Santa Fe railroad's main tourist destination and a major activity of the Harvey Company, especially after it became a national park in 1919. The rugged, landscape-integrated, and culturally appropriate design principles there influenced a generation of subsequent Western U.S. architecture through the National Park Service and Civilian Conservation Corps structures built during the Great Depression and after. Mary Colter, architect for the company from 1904 to 1949, in particular sought to incorporate her architecture into the natural splendor of the Canyon, drawing on its beauty. Colter focused on authenticity. Hopi House and Bright Angel Lodge, both on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, are prime examples of her work, which influenced popular interpretations of ‚Äúthe desert‚Äù and indigenous America. Bright Angel Lodge was completed in 1935, during the Great Depression. The Harvey team, with the backing of the Santa Fe railroad, created an entire set of cultural images based on the region's distinctive, and often overlooked, artistic traditions of the Native American residents and the early Spanish settlers in the area. Especially noteworthy were the buildings on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, including lodges, souvenirs shops, and special lookout points, today on the National Register of Historic Places. It has been suggested that the Harvey Houses originated the \\"blue-plate special\\", a daily low-priced complete meal served on a blue-patterned china plate; an 1892 Harvey menu mentions them, some thirty years before the term became widespread. In addition to the AT&SF;, the Harvey Company operated dining facilities for the Gulf Coast & Santa Fe, Kansas Pacific, St. Louis-San Francisco, and the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis railways. AT&SF; maintained and operated a fleet of three passenger ferry boats that connected the railroad with San Francisco by water. Ships traveled the eight miles between the San Francisco Ferry Terminal and the railroad's Point Richmond terminal across the Bay. The service was originally established as a continuation of the company's named passenger train runs such as the Angel and the Saint. The larger two ships, the San Pablo and the San Pedro, each featured a newsstand-lunch counter located on the main deck, and a dining room on the upper deck. Meals, sandwiches, sweet rolls, pastries, and coffee were served. AT&SF; discontinued ferry service in 1933 due to the effects of the Great Depression. Harvey Girls A preserved \\"Harvey Girl\\" uniform Judy Garland in a scene from The Harvey Girls. El Garces railroad depot, hotel, and restaurant in Needles, California, around the turn of the 20th century. The facility, opened in 1908, was named after Padre Francisco Garc√©s, a noted Franciscan Spanish priest who made several journeys through the region in 1771 and 1774 en route between southern Arizona and the California Missions. The La Posada Hotel, built in 1929 and opened in 1930, in Winslow, Arizona. This hotel is the last of the Fred Harvey Hotels. In 1883, Harvey implemented a policy of employing a female, white-only serving staff. He sought single, well-mannered, and educated American ladies, and placed ads in newspapers throughout the East Coast and Midwest for \\"white, young women, 18‚Äì30 years of age, of good character, attractive and intelligent\\". The girls were paid $18.50 a month, plus room and board, a generous income by the standards of the time.Fred Harvey and the Harvey Girls The women were subjected to a strict 10 p.m. curfew, administered by a senior Harvey Girl who assumed the role and responsibilities of house mother. The official starched black and white uniform (which was designed to diminish the female physique) consisted of a skirt that hung no more than eight inches off the floor, \\"Elsie\\" collars, opaque black stockings, and black shoes. The hair was restrained in a net and tied with a regulation white ribbon. Makeup of any sort was absolutely prohibited, as was chewing gum while on duty. Harvey Girls (as they soon came to be known) were required to enter into a six-month employment contract, and forfeited half their base pay should they fail to complete the term of service. Marriage was the most common reason for a girl to terminate her employment. The restrictions maintained the clean-cut reputation of the Harvey Girls, and made them even more marriageable. Cowboy philosopher Will Rogers once said, ‚ÄúIn the early days the traveler fed on the buffalo. For doing so, the buffalo got his picture on the nickel. Well, Fred Harvey should have his picture on one side of the dime, and one of his waitresses with her arms full of delicious ham and eggs on the other side, ‚Äòcause they have kept the West supplied with food and wives.‚Äù However, just the opportunity to leave their homes, enjoy travel, have new experiences, and work outside the home was very liberating for thousands of young women. After the Harvey Houses closed in most cities, many former Girls (and today their daughters and granddaughters) joined in appreciation to carry on their legacy. In a mythology that has grown around the Harvey Houses and Harvey Girls, these female employees are said to have helped to \\"civilize the American Southwest\\".Jesse Rhodes. How the West Was Won ... By Waitresses: Harvey Girls Helped Settle the West and Advance the Stature of Women in the Workforce, Smithsonian.com, July 8, 2013. This legend found expression in The Harvey Girls, a 1942 novel by Samuel Hopkins Adams and in the 1946 MGM musical film of the same name which was inspired by it, starring Judy Garland. Dining car service Harvey initially balked at the suggestion that in-transit dining facilities be added to all AT&SF; trains operating west of Kansas City. Eventually, Harvey agreed to support the railroad in this endeavor, and the California Limited became the first AT&SF;'s name trains to feature Harvey Company meal service en route. Later trains, such as the vaunted Super Chief, included dining cars (staffed by Fred Harvey Company personnel) as part of the standard passenger car complement right from the outset. Mary Colter specially designed a china pattern, Mimbreno, for the Super Chief‚Äôs dining cars. Separation from AT&SF; Beginning in the 1930s, the Fred Harvey Company began expanding into other locations beyond the reach of AT&SF;, and often away from rail passenger routes. Restaurants were opened in such locations as the Chicago Union Station (the largest facility operated by Harvey), San Diego Union Station, the San Francisco Bus Terminal, and the Albuquerque International Airport; the last of these was established at the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal in 1939, and could accommodate nearly 300 diners. From 1959 until 1975, the Fred Harvey organization operated a series of restaurants in the Illinois Tollway oasis, a set of highway rest stops built on bridges over the tollway. In 1954, the Harvey family purchased the Grand Canyon hotels from the AT&SF;, thus ensuring that the Fred Harvey Company would continue to make money. In 1966, Fred Harvey purchased the Furnace Creek Inn, near Death Valley National Park, from U.S. Borax in 1966 after operating it for a decade. The original Fred Harvey Company, as well as the company's close affiliation with AT&SF;, lasted until 1968 when it was purchased by the Amfac Corporation of Hawaii. Amfac was renamed Xanterra Parks & Resorts in 2002.Xanterra's Fred Harvey Legacy In 2006, Xanterra purchased the Grand Canyon Railway and its properties.

It was first observed at the Crystal Lake Hatchery, Shasta County, California, and has now been reported from Idaho, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska (Bartholomew et al. 1989). Life history In addition to the fish host, C. shasta infects a freshwater polychaete worm (Bartholomew et al., 1997). Actinospores are released from the worm, and infect fish, on contact, in the water column. Neither horizontal (fish to fish), nor vertical (fish to egg) transmissions have been documented under laboratory conditions, suggesting that the worm host is necessary for completion of the life cycle. Spores are released back into freshwater system after its fish host dies, however the complete life cycle, host and vector interaction is not fully understood (especially the ecology of the polychaete host). Research indicates that the potential for infection is enhanced when water temperatures are high, water flow is low, or numbers of infectious C. shasta are relatively high. Infection rates appear to be higher in or below still water environments than riverine ones. Pathology of infection Clinical indications of infection in salmons include lethargy, loss of body mass, darkening of the skin, ascites, exopthalmia and kidney pustules, These symptoms vary from one salmonid species to another, and also depend on life stage of the host. Internally, infection with C. shasta affects entire digestive tract, liver, gall bladder, spleen, gonads, kidney, heart, gills, and muscle tissues. Infection with C. shasta in adult chinook salmon causes mortality through intestinal perforations and co-occurring bacterial infections. Cold temperatures and salinity may reduce progress of disease, but do not eliminate infection. Progression of infection and mortality is temperature dependent, with higher temperature increasing disease progression and resulting in quicker mortality.''' Disease resistance Salmonid stocks exhibit variable resistance to C. shasta (Bartholomew 1998). Resistance is variable and may be compromised by environmental conditions which enhance infectivity. Salmonid stocks which are resistant to C. shasta are not necessarily resistant to other myxosporean infections, such as Myxobolus cerebralis. References * Bartholomew, J. L. (1998).

The term has particularly been used to describe men who have sex with men, though the term applies to people of all genders and sexual orientations. Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in HIV infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study. Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon.

Mavrud (, from Greek, ŒºŒ±œÖœÅœå (mavr√≥), \\"black\\") is a red wine grape that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines, indigenous to the Balkan region. It's growing in some regions in Albania, Thrace region in Bulgaria, some regions in Greece and in Rumania.Pierre Galet: Dictionnaire encyclop√©dique des c√©pages. 1st edition. Hachette Livre, 2000, . The grape has been described as a characterful, low- yielding, small-berried and late-ripening grape capable of producing tannic, spicy wine with a potential for ageing. History Regarded as one of the most highly esteemed local wines, Mavrud vineyards are mainly found around Asenovgrad and Perushtitsa, as well as more rarely near Pazardzhik, Stara Zagora and Chirpan. There is speculation amongst grape growers that Mavrud may be an ancient clone of Mourvedre, imported into Bulgaria by the Romans. Legend A legend that the oenophiles of the Mavrud wine like to repeat in order to explain the restoration of this locality as wine-growing country was that during the reign of Khan Krum of Bulgaria, all vineyards were ordered destroyed. Later, a lion escaped from its cage and terrorized the city. However, a fearless young man named Mavrud (now the name of a wine grape) confronted and slew the lion. The king summoned Mavrud's mother to learn the source of such courage. She said she had secretly saved a vine, made wine, and that this was the source of Mavrud's bravery. Khan Krum ordered the vineyards replanted. In the original Bulgarian version the legend says it was a monster called the lamyata (–ª–∞–º—è—Ç–∞) which was vanquished, according to one book on wine.

Opened by Loew's Theatres as a movie palace in 1929 and closed in 1977, the theater sat empty for decades until a complete renovation was initiated in 2010. The theater reopened to the public on January 23, 2015 as a performing arts venue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 22, 2012. History Loew's Kings Theatre was designed by the architectural firm of Rapp and Rapp. The interior decor was designed by Harold W. Rambusch. It was built and operated by the Loew's Theatres chain, and was one of the five \\"Loew's Wonder Theatres\\" in the New York metropolitan area. This 3,676 seat house originally presented shows that combined movies and live vaudeville. It opened September 7, 1929, with a program that included the film Evangeline, a live stage show, orchestra and solo pipe organ.The film Evangeline was based on the poem Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The film's star, Dolores del R√≠o made a special live appearance. With the decline of vaudeville, however, the theater soon converted to showing feature films only. On August 30, 1977, the Loew's Kings closed. Its final film was Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth. After the time of its closing, when its lavish 1929 interior was almost completely intact, the shuttered theater slowly deteriorated.

The roof was belatedly repaired in 1991, and again in 2007 to halt further deterioration. It has been owned by the City of New York since 1979.Gray, Christopher. \\"The Kings Is Dead! Long Live the Kings!\\", New York Times Accessed March 11, 2007 After closing, the theater was subject of a film documentary, ''Memoirs of a Movie Palace''. The renovated interior Renovation After having been the object of numerous proposals for its restoration over the previous thirty years, the Kings Theatre underwent a complete renovation. The City of New York announced the plan on February 2, 2010, with a goal of returning the theatre to use as a performing arts venue. The $93 million renovation was completed in partnership with a private developer, ACE Theatrical Group of Houston, which had previously overseen major restorations of a number of historic theaters including the Boston Opera House. The new managers, ACE Theatrical Group, spent $95 million on the renovation, including over $75,000 just on the restoration of the lobby furniture, which had been saved for four decades by the theater's old manager. The theater's interior spaces were restored to their 1929 appearance, and its stage facilities completely rebuilt to modern standards. Restoration work in the auditorium and lobby was underway and nearing completion through late 2014. Diana Ross was the featured artist for the gala reopening performance on February 3, 2015. Organ When the Loew's Kings Theatre opened it was equipped with a Robert Morton theatre pipe organ. The instrument contained 23 ranks of pipes played on an elaborately decorated four manual console, one of Robert Morton's \\"Wonder Morton\\" designs, installed in all the Loew's Wonder Theatres. The organ was popular with audiences and was featured in performances between film showings. The organ remained in good condition and was played one last time in 1974 prior to its being removed and donated by the Loew's company to New York City's Town Hall. The instrument was never reinstalled however, and most of its pipes and works disappeared while in storage. In 1998, the lavish console was rebuilt for use with a comparable pipe organ in a private home in Wheaton, Illinois. The Van der Molen family sent a \\"Deed of Gift\\" for their now 4/26 Wonder Morton to the New York Theatre Organ Society (NYTOS) on July 13, 2011. In 2013 the organ was removed from the family's home and placed in storage for an anticipated return to the restored Kings Theatre. The renovation project budget however did not provide for transport and re-installation of the organ, estimated to cost $650,000. An engineering evaluation determined that the already installed mechanical renovations took up room in the former organ lofts that the pipes would need. It was decided that an electronic organ, played through the theatre's original console, would offer the most feasible solution. In December 2014 ACE agreed to assist in the development of an electronic reproduction of the Wonder Morton. The donated pipe work would be sold or donated to a suitable venue.

The school is located on a large, secluded campus surrounded by wooded areas in Gahanna, Ohio in the United States, 8 miles from downtown Columbus. The Academy was founded in 1911 by J. L. Hamill in Bexley, Ohio and moved to its current campus in 1968. Originally an all-boys school, it became coeducational in 1991 when the Board of Trustees decided to admit girls. From its conception, the school expanded over time to a matriculation level of 1,000 students. Columbus Academy students and alumni often refer to the school as \\"Academy\\".  Founding And Bexley Campus  In 1911, a group of area businessmen founded the school to provide a local option for boys' secondary education. They adopted the independent country day school philosophy that academic preparation was a cooperative effort between the school and the home. Columbus Academy's first campus was situated on along Alum Creek. Numerous additions to the \\"main house\\" were made as the number of students in grades 5-12 grew. Academy's first headmaster, Frank P.R. Van Syckel, instituted a liberal arts program and athletic instruction.  Move to current campus  After continued enrollment growth and repeated flooding along Alum Creek, the Board approved a 20-year plan for relocation. The school acquired in Gahanna (eight miles northeast of Columbus), raised funds, and built a new campus. The original five-building complex served the school well until the student body exceeded 600 boys. In the mid-'70s, the school undertook a major building program that added a lower school wing and the Schoedinger Theatre. This expansion allowed Kindergarten to be added to the school in the early 1980s. In 1991, the school became a co- educational institution. The school is situated on a secluded suburban campus. In 1999 the school built a new library reminiscent of its old Bexley campus, and added large additions to the theatre and Lower and Upper schools in 2004. Beginning in 2003, they added another addition, respectably larger than the last. This addition consisted of a new athletic building, new sports facilities and courts, additional parking lots, a new upper school wing, and a third library (totaling three libraries: one lower school, one middle school, and one upper school). In the 2014 - 2015 school year, a ropes course and new playground was added to the Columbus Academy campus. Athletics The Academy was one of the first schools in the US to field a soccer team and track team. Today, Academy students compete interscholastically and intramurally in football, soccer, track, baseball, basketball, tennis, golf, lacrosse, wrestling, field hockey, swimming, cross country, and other sports.

Service history= United States Navy  Named for Midshipman William W. Edwards, she was launched 10 October 1918 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Julia Edwards Noyes, whose great-grandfather was the uncle of Midshipman Edwards; and commissioned 24 April 1919 at Boston Navy Yard, Commander P. L. Wilson in command. In May 1919 Edwards carried spare parts for airplanes and seaplanes to St. John's, Newfoundland, as reserves for the historic first transatlantic seaplane flight made by Navy planes. She sailed from Boston, Massachusetts 28 May to report to Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in Europe, for duty with the Food Administration. Arriving at Gibraltar in June, she took part in escorting the naval transport carrying President Woodrow Wilson into Brest, then visited England and Germany before returning to the United States on 25 August. Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, Edwards sailed from New York on 17 September 1919 and arrived at the destroyer base at San Diego, California on 13 October where she was placed in reduced commission with a partial complement 1 November 1919. In February 1920 she moved to Puget Sound Navy Yard, but returned to San Diego a year later where she remained in reserve, occasionally putting to sea for target practice. She was placed out of commission 8 June 1922. Recommissioned 18 December 1939, Edwards was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol, and after overhaul, left the west coast 22 March for Galveston, Texas. She patrolled the Gulf and east coast until fall, then sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was decommissioned 8 October 1940, and delivered to the British government as one of the destroyers exchanged for bases.  World War II  Commissioned in the Royal Navy 8 October 1940 as HMS Buxton (H96) for service in the third \\"Town\\" Flotilla, the destroyer served in Canadian waters briefly as the U-boat war intensified; she was then allocated to 6th Escort Group, Western Approaches Command, for the vital duty of keeping the supply line open to Britain. Buxton was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4\\"/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog.Lenton & Colledge (1968) pp.92-94 In August 1942, when newer escorts were available, she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Buxton, assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) based at Halifax. After undergoing refit in Boston from December 1942 to March 1943 she rejoined the WLEF in April, 1943. She was withdrawn from service that August and used as a static training ship at Halifax and then Digby, Nova Scotia, until the end of 1944. She was finally paid off early in 1945.

Cochran, 544 U.S. 734 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court case involving libel. Background The case began in California with Johnnie Cochran, the famed attorney who represented O. J. Simpson, suing his former client Ulysses Tory for libel and invasion of privacy. Cochran had withdrawn as Tory‚Äôs lawyer in a civil rights suit nearly twenty years earlier, and in the late 1990s Tory began picketing Cochran‚Äôs office, carrying signs that accused him of being a thief and of accepting bribes. A trial judge ruled that Tory had made false and defamatory statements about Cochran, and instead of awarding him damages, issued an injunction ordering Tory to never again display a sign or speak about Cochran. Tory appealed, arguing that the order was a prior restraint that violated his First Amendment right to free speech. In an unpublished opinion, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the order was constitutional. The California Supreme Court declined to review the case, and on April 24, 2004, Tory filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition was granted, briefing followed and the oral argument took place on March 22, 2005. Cochran died seven days later and the court asked for further briefing. Opinion of the Court On May 31, 2005, the court ruled 7‚Äì2 that in light of Cochran's death, the injunction limiting the demonstrations of Ulysses Tory \\"amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech\\". Two justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, said that Cochran's death made it unnecessary for the court to rule.

Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., ; United Mine Workers v. Pennington, . The doctrine is grounded in the First Amendment protection of political speech, and \\"upon a recognition that the antitrust laws, 'tailored as they are for the business world, are not at all appropriate for application in the political arena.'\\", quoting Noerr, 365 U.S. at 141. Origins The doctrine was set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. and United Mine Workers v. Pennington. The Court later expanded on the doctrine in California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited.. In Noerr, the Court held that \\"no violation of the [Sherman] Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws\\". Similarly, the Court wrote in Pennington that \\"[j]oint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition.\\" Finally, in California Motor Transport, the Court added that \\"the right to petition extends to all departments of the Government [and] [t]he right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.\\" Pursuant to this doctrine, immunity extends to attempts to petition all departments of the government. And \\"if . . . conduct constitutes valid petitioning, the petitioner is immune from antitrust liability whether or not the injuries are caused by the act of petitioning or are caused by government action which results from the petitioning.\\" Doctrine Under the Noerr‚ÄìPennington doctrine,\\"[a] party who petitions the government for redress generally is immune from antitrust liability.\\"Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., 168 F.3d 119, 122 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, . Petitioning is immune from liability even if there is an improper purpose or motive.See (holding that even if the petitioner's sole purpose was to destroy its competition through passage of legislation, petitioner would be immune); (same). Noerr‚ÄìPennington immunity applies to actions which might otherwise violate the Sherman Act because \\"the federal antitrust laws do not regulate the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action from the government.\\"Omni, 499 U.S. at 379-80. The antitrust laws are designed for the business world and \\"are not at all appropriate for application in the political arena.\\"Noerr, 365 U.S. at 141. This was evident in Noerr, where defendant railroads campaigned for legislation intended to ruin the trucking industry. Even though defendants employed deceptive and unethical means, the Supreme Court held that they were still immune. This is because the Sherman Act is designed to control \\"business activity\\" and not \\"political activity.\\"Noerr, 365 U.S. at 129. With this underpinning, the Court stated, \\"[Because] the right of petition is one of the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, . . . we cannot, of course, lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms.\\"Noerr, 365 U.S. at 136. The antitrust laws were enacted to regulate private business and do not abrogate the right to petition. Limited scope The scope of Noerr‚ÄìPennington immunity, however, depends on the \\"source, context, and nature of the competitive restraint at issue.\\". *If the restraint directly results from private action there is no immunity.See Allied Tube, 486 U.S. at 500 (where the \\"restraint upon trade or monopolization is the result of valid governmental action, as opposed to private action,\\" there is immunity). Passive government approval is insufficient. Private parties cannot immunize an anticompetitive agreement merely by subsequently requesting legislative approval. *Private parties may be immunized against liability stemming from antitrust injuries flowing from valid petitioning. This includes two distinct types of actions. ::#A petitioner may be immune from the antitrust injuries which result from the petitioning itself.See Noerr, 365 U.S. at 143 (finding trucking industry plaintiffs' relationships with their customers and the public were hurt by the railroads' petitioning activities, yet the railroads were immune from liability). ::#Also, parties are immune from liability arising from the antitrust injuries caused by government action which results from the petitioning.See Pennington, 381 U.S. at 671 (holding plaintiffs could not recover damages resulting from the state's actions); Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Assoc., 107 F.3d 1026, 1037 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding Noerr gave immunity for any damages stemming from state adoption of requirements for bar admission to petitioners who lobbied for their adoption); 1 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, at P 202c. Therefore, if its conduct constitutes valid petitioning, the petitioner is immune from antitrust liability whether or not the injuries are caused by the act of petitioning or are caused by government action which results from the petitioning. Expansion of the doctrine beyond the antitrust arena Since its formulation, the doctrine has been extended to confer immunity from a variety of tort claims, including claims of unfair competition, tortious interference and abuse of process.See, e.g., Thermos Co. v. Igloo Products Corp., 1995 WL 745832, *6 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (holding that \\"attempts to protect a valid and incontestable trademark\\" are privileged under the Noerr‚ÄìPennington doctrine); Virtual Works, Inc. v. Network Solutions, Inc., 1999 WL 1074122 (E.D. Va. 1999) (applying the Noerr‚ÄìPennington doctrine to tortious interference claims); Brownsville Golden Age Nursing Home, Inc. v. Wells, 839 F.2d 155, 159-60 (3d Cir. 1988) (recognizing applicability of the doctrine to abuse of process and other claims); Baltimore Scrap Corp. v. David J. Joseph Co., 81 F. Supp. 2d 602, 620 (D.Md. 2000), aff'd, 237 F.3d 394 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding that Noerr‚ÄìPennington immunity applies to common law claims). The Ninth Circuit recently held that Noerr‚ÄìPennington also protects against RICO Act claims when a defendant has sent thousands of demand letters threatening suit. Exception for sham proceedings There is a \\"sham\\" exception to the Noerr‚ÄìPennington doctrine which holds that using the petitioning process simply as an anticompetitive tool without legitimately seeking a positive outcome to the petitioning destroys immunity.See Omni, . The Supreme Court has articulated a two-part test to determine the existence of \\"sham\\" litigation. First, such suits must be \\"objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.\\"Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus. (\\"PREI\\"), . If that threshold is met, the court will inquire whether the suit demonstrates evidence of a subjective intent to use governmental process to interfere with a competitor's business. For example, in California Motor Transport v. Trucking Unlimited, the United States Supreme Court held that the Noerr‚ÄìPennington doctrine did not apply where defendants had sought to intervene in licensing proceedings for competitors, because the intervention was not based on a good-faith effort to enforce the law, but was solely for the purpose of harassing those competitors and driving up their costs of doing business. The sine qua non of a \\"sham\\" proceeding is not the purpose to harm a competitor, but rather the absence of any purpose to actually obtain government action. Thus, initiating an administrative proceeding that one actually hopes to win in order to harm one's competitors is within the ambit of the Noerr‚ÄìPennington doctrine, while initiating a similar proceeding that one does not meaningfully intend to win solely to delay one's business competitors is within the sham exception. In 1993, the Supreme Court rejected a purely subjective definition of a \\"sham\\" lawsuit, and set out a two-part test. Under the first prong of the test, a lawsuit fits within the \\"sham\\" exception to First Amendment immunity only if the lawsuit is objectively baseless in that \\"no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.\\" Only if the challenged litigation meets the first prong (\\"objectively baseless\\") may a court go on to the next prong, which consists of a determination of whether the litigant's subjective motivation in filing the objectively baseless lawsuit was an attempt to interfere with the business of a competitor.

A digital printing system is attached to a computer database and many similar pages, called forms, are printed; each, for example, with a different person's data filling the form such as a monthly telephone or cable bill. Simply stated, transaction printing is the printing of multiple transactions for each customer along with the fixed line details like name and address. This is more used in BFSI sectors, for example, bank statements. Transaction printing jobs are similar to, but often more complex than variable data printing jobs such as mail merge. Transaction printing frequently requires customized formatting to present transaction data in a printable and customer- readable format. Currently, printing applications are designed to print transactional details along with the external information (not available in the transaction database), often involving promotional material. Transaction print jobs are different from 'publishing' print jobs in that the print controller does not know when the job will end when it starts. A transactional print job may involve a hundred, a thousand, or a few million impressions. Many digital printing system's controllers are designed to ingest the entire job, arrange its resources according to the size of the job and then begin printing the job last page first so that what is produced is a 'book' with the user seeing the first page first. This 'publishing' model obviously does not work for 'transaction' printing and a controller using a different internal model for jobs must be used.

According to music journalist Jason Ankeny of AllMusic, \\"the British acid jazz trio [are] notable for their pioneering synthesis of acoustic instruments and electronic textures\\". Career Red Snapper at Milk Club, Moscow, 2009 The band released three EPs on Flaw Recordings before signing to Warp Records for their debut album, Prince Blimey (1996). The band were a somewhat unusual feature of Warp Records' 1990s roster: in contrast to the studio-oriented IDM the record label primarily dealt in, the band had a live and organic sound: a smoky mixture of dub, jazz and all tempos of breakbeat from trip hop to drum and bass. In 1997, Red Snapper (along with the Foo Fighters) supported the Prodigy on their Fat of the Land tour in the UK. For their follow-up Making Bones they were joined by jungle MC Det, Byron Wallen the jazz trumpeter, and singer Alison David. The latter was replaced by Karim Kendra by their third album, Our Aim Is to Satisfy (2000). In early 2002, Red Snapper announced its dissolution. In interviews since the reunion the band said a reason for splitting was too much discussing what to play, rather than playing. Each member wanted to try a different musical direction. Also in 2002 the various artists compilation album It's All Good was released. It included a previously unreleased track, \\"Ultraviolet\\", which was also included on Red Snapper, a compilation of unreleased and rare Red Snapper tracks released by Lo Recordings in 2003. Later in 2003, an album of remixes was released, Redone, which included tracks remixed by the Snapper themselves. Ayers and Felix Tod were credited as The Creation, Thair remixed \\"Ultraviolet\\", and the \\"Odd Man Out\\" (Odd Man remix) was done by Friend, Gavin Clark and Ted Barnes. The last track included vocals. Later the Flameboy Records (owned by Jake Williams, former RS keyboard player) released a four-track vinyl called \\"RedOne\\", which included three tracks from Redone and a previously unreleased Red Snapper track entitled \\"Drill\\", featuring MC Det.

Rich has been working with Jakeone on their > band Toob, with Rennie Pilgrem and the TCR Allstars and Bomb the Bass. In late 2007, the band decided to rejoin after a jam session. They returned to the recording studio to work on new material for their sixth album. Saxophonist Tom Challenger played at the sessions and became a member of the band. Red Snapper appeared at the Bloc Weekend in March 2008. The band released Pale Blue Dot (Lo Recordings) on 2 October 2008. They appeared on the Glade Stage at Glastonbury 2009. In May 2011 the band released Key, their seventh album on V2 Benelux with original band members Rich Thair (drums), Ali Friend (double bass/vocals) and David Ayers (guitar).

He is the father of U.S. Congressmen Lincoln D√≠az-Balart and Mario D√≠az-Balart, TV news journalist Jos√© D√≠az- Balart, and investment banker Rafael D√≠az-Balart. He is the brother of Mirta D√≠az-Balart, Fidel Castro's first wife. His brother, Waldo D√≠az-Balart is a painter and a former actor who appeared in two movies by Andy Warhol in the 1960s. His father, Rafael D√≠az-Balart was elected to the Cuban House of Representatives in 1936 and his brother-in-law, Juan Caballero, was elected to the Cuban House of Representatives in 1954. Following his departure from Cuba, Rafael Diaz-Balart spent the following years living in Spain. He worked there as an insurance company executive with Aseguros Iberica La Providencia. This company had investments in real estate companies which developed property on the Spanish Riviera. He then also spent several years serving as a diplomat for the government of Costa Rica in Venezuela and Paraguay. D√≠az-Balart died on May 6, 2005 in his Key Biscayne, Florida home after a battle with leukemia.

It is commonly known as the squash bug but shares this name with certain other species. Description The adult Anasa tristis is a greyish-brown, somewhat flattened insect reaching a length of about and a width of . There is often a row of alternate brown and gold spots along the margin of the abdomen. Adults survive for three or four months. Host plants Anasa tristis can be found on various members of the gourd family Cucurbitaceae, but most often occurs on pumpkins and squashes. Some varieties and cultivars are more susceptible to attack than others. Research has shown that nymphs can grow to adulthood with varying degrees of success on different host plants; 70%, 49%, 14%, 0.3% and 0% survived to maturity on pumpkin, squash, watermelon, cucumber and cantaloupe melon respectively. Life cycle In the southern part of its range, the adult female Anasa tristis lays two or three batches of about eighteen eggs, but in the northern part of the range it just lays a single batch. The eggs are oval, somewhat flattened and bronze in colour, and are deposited on the underside of the leaves of the host plant. They may be clustered close together or more widely dispersed but are often regularly arranged. The eggs hatch after seven to nine days into nymphs which have five instar stages. The first instar nymphs are green and about in length. Each successive instar is larger and less hairy and grey. The fifth instar is grey, with developing wing pads and about in length. The complete nymphal stage lasts about 33 days. Damage Anasa tristis is a true bug that feeds by sucking sap, mainly from the leaves, but sometimes also the fruit. In the process of doing this the insects inject toxic saliva into the plant tissues which causes them to wilt, darken in colour and die. The heavier the infestation, the greater the damage to the plant. Sometimes one plant or part of a plant can be heavily attacked while surrounding plants are untouched. Besides the direct damage their feeding causes to the plant, these insects can act as vectors for cucurbit yellow vine disease caused by the bacterium Serratia marcescens. This disease can kill the plants.

Rigsdagen was Denmark's first parliament, and it was incorporated in the Constitution of 1849. It was a bicameral legislature, consisting of two houses, the Folketing and the Landsting. The distinction between the two houses was not always clear, as they had equal power. In 1953, a new constitution was approved by referendum and adopted, with the result that Rigsdagen and the Landsting were eliminated in favor of a unicameral legislature under the name of the Folketing. Rigsdagen, like today's Folketing, was located in Christiansborg Palace in the centre of Copenhagen. Membership in Rigsdagen was limited to certain sectors of society - women were not allowed to join, and neither were about a quarter of all men over 30, mostly due to their condition as servants or welfare recipients. The name is a cognate of the names of several legislatures in other Germanic countries, such as the Reichstag in Germany, the Riksdag in Sweden, or the Riksdag in Finland.

It is the eighth and final work in his Worldwar series fictional universe. It follows the events of the Colonization trilogy and gives some closure to the storylines. Homeward Bound begins in 1972 and then flashes forward to 1977, 1982, 1984, 1994, 2012, and finally 2031, when the American starship Admiral Peary arrives at Tau Ceti and Home, the homeworld of The Race. Title Homeward Bound has multiple meanings in the book. It is a pun in that the Race's home planet is called Home, and many characters are headed there. For characters that are members of the Race, such as Ttomalss, Atvar, and Straha, they are headed home after the failed conquest of Earth. For Kassquit, it is her cultural home although not her biological one. The Earth ship Admiral Peary is headed to the planet Home, where they will confront the Race and try to demand respect as an independent planet or at least for the United States. At the end of the novel, while most of the ship's crew has been in cryogenic sleep and suffered time dilation, they are given the chance to go back to Earth (their home). As the characters arrive, they handle their return as best they can. Plot summary The Admiral Peary travels at between 0.35 and 0.4 c and takes a little over 30 years, instead of 24 (the Race's starship velocities are 0.5 c), to cross the twelve light-years between Earth and Tau Ceti. The ship is named Admiral Peary for its role as a military exploration ship, after Admiral Robert Peary, who did the same in an Arctic exploration. When the Admiral Peary arrives in orbit around Home, the Race's planet in the Tau Ceti system, it causes a crisis in the highest levels of the Race. The Race's Emperor Risson and Fleetlord Atvar, sent back to Home with the dubious distinction of being the only Fleetlord not to conquer a planet, argue the merits and drawbacks of attempting to destroy mankind by massive nuclear strikes. Meanwhile, Researcher Ttomalss investigates reports of a major breakthrough by human scientists back on Earth. The Race inadvertently cause itself a possible ecological disaster similar to what it caused on Earth with the Race's introduced species into the Earth's ecosystems by letting the humans' caged rats loose on Home. The rats were used for food testing for the humans. It comes as a great shock to the Race when a second human starship, the Commodore Perry, arrives in orbit around Home, having traveled the twelve light-years in just five weeks. The faster-than-light drive, which appears to be based on the principle of folding space, allows the crew to return to Earth, which is familiar but still different from how they left it. Another pun is the ship's captain, Nicole Nichols, inspired by Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura but playing off the actress's real name. The ship is named Commodore Perry for its role in opening up the Race's empire to access the US, after Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who did the same with Japan, and the Race fears that other human nations will make their way to Home, especially a recovered Germany.

(Risson is not the 37th Emperor [there have been thousands] but the 37th Emperor to bear the name \\"Risson.\\") * The Doctor - An off-screen character whose death causes Sam Yeager to assume the duties of US Ambassador to the Race. (Note: The character is generally referred to in the novel as \\"The Doctor\\" but is Henry Kissinger.) Major themes Diplomacy is a major theme of the novel. The humans spend their time trying to convince the Race that they are not dangerous barbarians. However, that mindset of the previously-technologically-superior Race will not be dissuaded. The Americans negotiate from a position of weakness, but both sides know that it is only a matter of time until that position becomes one of greater strength. War, a terribly destructive war in which \\"millions, and probably billions\\" would die on Earth, Home and possibly also on the Empire's two other worlds, is an ever-present possibility, but none of the negotiators on either side is especially warlike, and they are on quite good terms personally. The Admiral Peary orbits Home, loaded with nuclear missiles that could be launched to rain death and destruction on a world that had not known war for 100,000 years. Even The Race's imperial capital, with the Emperor in his palace, a shrine at the centre of The Race's religion as well a centre of government, might be obliterated, as the Emperor explicitly remarks in one scene. Actually using the missiles is clearly not the Americans' preferred option but is never ruled out. On the other hand, representatives of The Race are increasingly driven to the reluctant conclusion that they must launch a war of annihilation against the humans even though they have only a very doubtful chance of winning since waiting would reduce their chance of winning to zero. However, such considerations are rendered moot by the arrival of the FTL Commodore Perry, showing the Race that time has already run out for a pre- emptive war against the \\"Tosevites\\". The younger, newly-arrived Americans behave with a manifest arrogance of power not only towards The Race but even towards their own \\"obsolete\\" older countrymen and women of the Admiral Peary. However, representatives of The Race, while embarking on a desperate struggle to catch up and achieve FTL flight for themselves, are able to devise a counterdeterrence even with their existing sub-light ships. They come up with the idea of launching them to hit Earth at half-light speed, causing horrendous damage dwarfing that of nuclear weapons and possibly destroying Earth altogether or rendering it uninhabitable. The threat of so retaliating for a nuclear strike at Home effectively establishes an interstellar version of mutual assured destruction. Still, the situation remains fragile and precarious at the end, with not only The Race throwing their resources into the effort to achieve FTL flight but also the other human powers on Earth engaged on a similar effort. Members of The Race are especially worried about Germany, which had managed to recover from the terrible blows its war with The Race during the 1960s and, still ruled by the Nazis, would like to get revenge for that destruction. Also are the Soviet Union, which still exists in the mid-21st century and did not undergone perestroika or glasnost, and Imperial Japan, which still retains its pre-1945 nationalist and militarist ideology and never underwent a democratising US occupation. As against such dire threats, there is the hope that FTL would open up so many new planets for colonization as to give full satisfaction to everybody's expansionist inclinations, with no need of destructive wars. This hope is voiced by Human as well as \\"Lizard\\" characters. However, the book ends on a deliberately ambiguous note, with both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios fully feasible in the characters' immediate future.

The structure is the second-tallest building in the city, and it was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks on April 19, 1994. The tower is named after Joseph T. Carew, proprietor of the Mabley & Carew department store chain, which had previously operated on the site since 1877. The complex contains the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza (formerly Omni Netherland Plaza), which is described as a fine example of French Art Deco architecture. The hotel's Hall of Mirrors banquet room was inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The tower remained the city's tallest until the completion of the Great American Tower at Queen City Square on July 13, 2010, rising higher than Carew Tower. Previously, Cincinnati had been one of the last major American cities whose tallest building was constructed prior to World War II. History Carew Tower was designed by the architectural firm W.W. Ahlschlager & Associates with Delano & Aldrich and developed by John J. Emery. The original concept was a development that would include a department store, a theater, an office accommodation, and a hotel to rival the Waldorf- Astoria. Emery took on as partner Col. William A. Starrett (Starrett Investment Corp.) and Starrett Brothers, Inc. as general contractors. The building is widely considered to be an early prototype of an urban mixed-use development, a \\"city within a city\\". New York City's Rockefeller Center, built around the same time, is a more famous example of this concept. The Hotel Emery and an office block belonging to Mabley & Carew were demolished to make the site available for construction. Construction began in September 1929, just one month before the stock market crash on October 24 that triggered the Great Depression. Because of this, construction was continued on a modified plan. Art deco themes can be found throughout the building, particularly in the metalwork and grillwork of the elevators and lights. Locally sourced inlaid Rookwood Pottery floral tiles adorn the east and west entrances of the building. Sculpture on the exterior and interior of the building were executed by New York City architectural sculptor Rene Paul Chambellan. Eighteen Louis Grell murals can be found throughout the Hilton Netherland Plaza Hotel on the bottom floor. Ten wall-to-ceiling murals can be found in the hotel's original lobby, now the Palm Court, four Greek Themed murals in the Continental Room and two above the side entry staircase are the work of muralist and painter Louis Grell. The ten murals in the Palm Court represent the recreation and it is believed that the artist representations of Carew Tower can be found worked into each background by Grell. The staircase mural says \\"Welcome Travelers\\" and the four in the Continental Room represent the four seasons of the year. The massive 90 foot long Apollo Gallery boost another \\"Apollo on Chariot\\" mural and a large \\"Hunt of Diana\\" mural by Grell. All murals are believed to be oil on canvas. The total cost of the building was US$33 million, which at that time was an enormous sum of money. It took crews only 13 months to complete the construction, working 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Through the 1930s the Netherland Plaza Hotel was run by hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz's National Hotel Management Company.Cincinnati Enquirer Newspaper, 11 May 1937, Pg. 7; https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99498652/ Retrieved 08 March 2018 From 1930 until 1960, Carew Tower was the home of the Mabley & Carew department store. From 1967 to 1980, Carew Tower and the neighboring PNC Tower, then called the Central Trust Bank tower, were featured in the opening and closing credits of the daytime soap opera The Edge of Night, since Cincinnati was the stand-in for the show's fictional locale of Monticello. Procter & Gamble, the show's producer, is based in Cincinnati. From 1978 to 1982, it was also featured in the opening and closing credits on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati, although the show was produced in Hollywood. The building is home to a mixed group of tenants, including a shopping arcade, Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza, and offices. Visitors can access the observation deck located on the 49th floor. On a clear day, visitors can see for miles in all directions, and three states (Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio). Because of its architectural standards, as well as its identity with the city's heritage, Carew Tower was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994. The building was originally designed with three towers: the tallest housing offices, the second the hotel, and the third serving as a parking garage which had an elevator rather than traditional ramps for access. The third parking tower was demolished in 1980 due to corrosion from road salt. There was also a turntable for vehicles to assist in pointing delivery trucks in the right direction. The system has since been dismantled.

Unique among modern lizards, it is a marine reptile that has the ability to forage in the sea for algae, which makes up almost all of its diet. Large males are able to dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone. They mainly live in colonies on rocky shores where they bask after visiting the relatively cold water or intertidal zone, but can also be seen in marshes, mangrove and beaches. Large males defend territories for a short period, but smaller males have other breeding strategies. After mating, the female digs a nest hole in the soil where she lays her eggs, leaving them to hatch on their own a few months later. Marine iguanas vary in appearance between the different islands and several subspecies are recognized. Although relatively large numbers remain and it is locally abundant, this protected species is considered threatened, primarily from El Ni√±o cycles, introduced predators and chance events like oil spills. Taxonomy and evolution=Species description and etymology The marine iguana was first described in 1825 as Amblyrhynchus cristatus by Thomas Bell. He recognized several of its distinctive features, but believed that the specimen he had received was from Mexico, a locality now known to be erroneous. Its generic name, Amblyrhynchus, is a combination of two Greek words, Ambly- from Amblus (·ºÄŒºŒ≤ŒªœÖ) meaning \\"blunt\\" and rhynchus (œÅœÖŒ≥œáŒøœÇ) meaning \\"snout\\". Its specific name is the Latin word cristatus meaning \\"crested,\\" and refers to the low crest of spines along the animal's back. Amblyrhynchus is a monotypic genus, having only one species, Amblyrhynchus cristatus. Evolution A hybrid iguana, the result of interbreeding between a marine iguana and a Gal√°pagos land iguana Researchers theorize that land iguanas (genus Conolophus) and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor since arriving on the islands from Central or South America, presumably by rafting. The land and marine iguanas of the Gal√°pagos form a clade, the nearest relatives of which are the Ctenosaura iguanas of Mexico and Central America. Based on a study that relied on mtDNA, the marine iguana diverged from land iguanas some 8‚Äì10 million years ago, which is older than any of the extant Gal√°pagos islands. It has therefore traditionally been thought that the ancestral species inhabited parts of the volcanic archipelago that are now submerged. A more recent study that included both mtDNA and nDNA indicates that the two split about 4.5 million years ago, which is near the age of the oldest extant Gal√°pagos islands (Espa√±ola and San Crist√≥bal). The marine iguana and Gal√°pagos land iguana remain mutually fertile in spite of being separated by millions of years and assigned to distinct genera. They have been known to hybridize where their ranges overlap, resulting in the so-called hybrid iguana. This is very rare and has only been documented a few times on South Plaza, a tiny island where the usually separated breeding territories and seasons of the two species overlap. The hybrids have intermediate features, stay on land and are infertile. The different marine iguana populations fall into three main clades: western islands, northeastern islands and southeastern islands. These can be further divided, each subclade generally matching marine iguanas from one or two primary island, except on San Crist√≥bal where there are two subclades (a northeastern and a southwestern). However, even the oldest divergence between marine iguana populations is quite recent; no more than 230,000 years and likely less than 50,000 years. On occasion one makes it to another island than its home island, resulting in hybridization between different marine iguana populations. There is one confirmed record of a marine iguana outside the Gal√°pagos Islands; in 2014 an individual appeared on Isla de la Plata near the Ecuadorian mainland. Subspecies Seven or eight subspecies of the marine iguana, listed alphabetically, have traditionally been recognized: * A. c. albemarlensis Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1962 ‚Äì Isabela Island * A. c. ater Gray, 1831 (not always recognized) ‚Äì Pinz√≥n Island * A. c. cristatus Bell, 1825 ‚Äì Fernandina Island * A. c. hassi Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1962 ‚Äì Santa Cruz Island * A. c. mertensi Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1962 ‚Äì San Crist√≥bal and Santiago Islands * A. c. nanus Garman, 1892 ‚Äì Genovesa Island * A. c. sielmanni Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1962 ‚Äì Pinta Island * A. c. venustissimus Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1956 ‚Äì Espa√±ola Island and adjacent tiny Gardener Island In 2017, the first comprehensive taxonomic review of the species in more than 50 years came to another result based on morphological and genetic evidence, including recognizing five new subspecies (three of these are small-island populations that were not previously assigned to any subspecies): * A. c. cristatus Bell, 1825 (albermarlensis and ater are junior synonyms) ‚Äì Isabela Island and Fernandina Island * A. c. godzilla Miralles et al., 2017 ‚Äì northeastern part of San Crist√≥bal Island * A. c. hassi Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1962 ‚Äì Santa Cruz Island and smaller adjacent islands, such as Baltra Island * A. c. hayampi Miralles et al., 2017 ‚Äì Marchena Island * A. c. jeffreysi Miralles et al., 2017 ‚Äì Wolf Island, Darwin Island and Roca Redonda * A. c. mertensi Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1962 ‚Äì southwestern part of San Crist√≥bal Island * A. c. nanus Garman, 1892 ‚Äì Genovesa Island * A. c. sielmanni Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1962 ‚Äì Pinta Island * A. c. trillmichi Miralles et al., 2017 ‚Äì Santa F√© Island * A. c. venustissimus Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1956 ‚Äì Espa√±ola Island (including adjacent tiny Gardener Island) and Floreana Island * A. c. wikelskii Miralles et al., 2017 ‚Äì Santiago Island and smaller adjacent islands, such as R√°bida Island File:Gal√°pagos marine iguana.jpgA. c. albemarlensis on Isabela Island (a synonym of A. c. cristatus based on the 2017 review) File:Marine Iguana (A. c. cristatis), male, Fernandina Island.jpgA. c. cristatus on Fernandina Island File:Marine Iguana (A. c. hassi), male, Santa Cruz Island.jpgA. c. hassi on Santa Cruz Island File:Marine iguana and sea lion off of Shipwreck Bay in the Galapagos Islands.JPGA. c. mertensi at Shipwreck Bay, San Crist√≥bal Island File:Amblyrhynchus cristatus 1.jpgAmblyrhynchus cristatusMarine Iguanas, Galapagos Islands File:Marine Iguana (A. c. nanus), male, Genovesa Island.jpgA. c. nanus on Genovesa Island File:Marine-Iguana-Espanola.jpg A. c. venustissimus on Espa√±ola Island File:Marine Iguana (A. c. mertensi), Santiago Island, Ecuador.jpgA. c. wikelskii on Santiago Island (formerly included in A. c. mertensi) Appearance Marine iguanas from Espa√±ola Island are the most colourful and have sometimes been called \\"Christmas iguanas\\" Early visitors to the Gal√°pagos Islands considered the marine iguanas ugly and disgusting. In 1798, captain James Colnett of the British Royal Navy wrote: : The [i]guanas are small, and of a sooty black, which, if possible, heightens their native ugliness. Indeed, so disgusting is their appearance, that no one on board could be prevailed on, to take them as food. On his visit to the islands in 1835, despite making extensive observations on the creatures, Charles Darwin was revolted by the animals' appearance, writing: :The black Lava rocks on the beach are frequented by large (2‚Äì3 ft []), most disgusting, clumsy Lizards. They are as black as the porous rocks over which they crawl & seek their prey from the Sea. Somebody calls them 'imps of darkness'. They assuredly well-become the land they inhabit. Marine iguanas have a thickset body and relatively short, robust limbs. Adults have a row of spines extending from the nape, along the back to the tail. Males have longer spines, and larger bony plates on the top of their head than females. There are some differences in the spines depending on the island and they are most elaborate on Fernandina (subspecies cristatus). The scales on the top of the head of the marine iguana are quite conical and pointed. Although less extreme, the same can be seen in the Gal√°pagos land iguanas (genus Conolophus), while these scales at most are slightly domed in other iguanas. Overall the skeleton of the marine iguana shows many similarities with the chuckwallas (genus Sauromalus), but this is an example of homoplasy, as the two are not closely related. Marine iguanas are not always black; the young have a lighter coloured dorsal stripe, and some adult specimens are grey. Dark tones allow the lizards to rapidly absorb heat to minimize the period of lethargy after emerging from the water. The marine iguana lacks agility on land but is a graceful swimmer. Its laterally flattened tail provides propulsion and the row of spines along the back provide stability, while its long, sharp claws allow it to hold onto rocks in strong currents. Adult males vary in colour with the season, becoming brighter when breeding. There are also major differences in the colour of the adult males depending on the subspecies. Males of the relatively small southern islands of Espa√±ola, Floreana and Santa F√© (subspecies venustissimus and trillmichi) are the most colourful, with bright pinkish-red and turquoise markings. In comparison, those of the relatively small northern islands of Genovesa, Marchena, Pinta, Wolf and Darwin (jeffreysi, hayampi, sielmanni and nanus) are almost all blackish without contrasting markings. Other subspecies tend to resemble duller versions of venustissimus and trillmichi, or are blackish with markings in pale yellowish, ochre, greenish or grey (sooty to near white). It is suspected that the exact algal diet of each population plays a role in their colour. Females show much less variation between the islands and are typically dark with less contrasting colours than the males. In most places, females do not change colour conspicuously between the breeding and non-breeding season, but at least on Espa√±ola (subspecies venustissimus) they do assume relatively bright male-like colours when nesting, which is possibly related to their need of defending the nest from other females on an island with few suitable sites. Size Marine iguanas from Santa Cruz Island (subspecies hassi) are among the largest Marine iguanas typically range from in snout-to-vent length and have a tail length from . There are major geographical differences, as iguanas from large islands tend to grow relatively large as adults, while those from small islands are smaller in size. In one study, the average snout-to-vent length on Wolf and Darwin Islands (subspecies jeffreysi) was about , and those on Genovesa Island (subspecies nanus) were only slightly larger. In comparison, Santa Cruz marine iguanas (hassi) had an average snout-to-vent length of about , and those of Isabela and Fernandina (cristatus) were only slightly smaller. Other subspecies were of intermediate size, in between the small Wolf, Darwin and Genovesa iguanas and the large Santa Cruz, Isabela and Fernandina iguanas. In another study, the largest were from western San Crist√≥bal Island (mertensi), followed by those from Isabela (cristatus, in part), Floreana (venustissimus, in part), eastern San Crist√≥bal (godzilla), Fernandina (cristatus, in part) and Santa Cruz (hassi). The smallest by far were from Genovesa (nanus), but this study did not include any marine iguanas from Wolf and Darwin Islands. The remaining island populations were of intermediate size. The maximum weight of adult males ranges from on southern Isabela to on Genovesa. This difference in body size of marine iguanas between islands is due to the amount of food available, which depends on sea temperature and algae growth. Marine iguanas are sexually dimorphic with adult males on average being significantly longer and weighing about twice as much as adult females. However, the largest females are only about 20‚Äì40% shorter than the largest males. There is a correlation between longevity and body size, particularly for adult males. Large body size in males is selected sexually, but can be detrimental during El Ni√±o events when resources are scarce. This results in large males suffering higher mortality than females and smaller adult males. The mortality rates of marine iguanas are explained through the size difference between the sexes. Behavior=Reproduction and life cycle A male will threaten another male by bobbing his head and opening the mouth, displaying the reddish pink interior During territorial fights males headbutt, each attempting to push away the opponent A marine iguana nest hole (center of image) Juveniles on Isabela Island Female marine iguanas reach sexual maturity at the age of 3‚Äì5 years, while males reach sexual maturity at the age of 6‚Äì8 years. Sexual maturity is marked by the first steep and abrupt decline in bone growth cycle thickness. Marine iguanas can reach an age of up to 60 years, but average is 12 years or less. Reproduction in the marine iguana begins during the last part of the cold and dry season, with breeding from December to March and nesting from January to April. The exact timing varies with location, depending on algal growth and the nutrient-rich Cromwell Current. It occurs earliest on islands like Fernandina, Isabela, Santa F√© and Genovesa, and latest on islands like Espa√±ola. An adult marine iguana, whether male or female, will typically breed every other year, but if there is plenty of food a female may breed each year. Marine iguanas live in coastal colonies that typically range from 20 to 500 animals, but sometimes more than 1,000. Their bodies often touch each other, but there are no social interactions like grooming, as commonly seen in social mammals and birds. Females are always highly gregarious and males are gregarious outside the breeding season. However, large males defend territories for up to three months during the breeding season, and in this period they sometimes fight other males. A territory can be up to almost , but is usually less than half that size, and can be as small as . A territory is often delimited by geographic features, like boulders or crevices. The territories tend to occur in clusters with several located adjacent to each other, forming a lek, but they can occur singly. Medium-sized males roam areas near the territories of large males or walk along beaches looking for females, while small \\"sneaky\\" males may enter the territories of large males. To threaten another male, a male will bob his head, walk on stiff legs, raise the spiny crest along the back and open the mouth to reveal the reddish interior. In most cases the suitor will turn away, but if he responds with the same behavior a fight ensues. During fights they typically do not bite each other, instead thrusting their heads together in an attempt to push the other away. The bony plates on the top of their heads are especially suited for interlocking. Fights between males may last for hours, and are often interrupted by periodic breaks. Once a winner has been established through the headbutting, the loser assumes a submissive position and retreats. In general fights between males are harmless and highly ritualized, but on occasion they will bite and injure each other. Males are primarily selected by females on the basis of their body size. Females display a stronger preference for mating with bigger males. It is precisely because of body size that reproductive performance increases and \\"is mediated by higher survival of larger hatchlings from larger females and increased mating success of larger males.\\" Other factors involved in the female's choice of partner are the display frequency by a male (especially head-bobbing) and the quality of a male's territory. Females prefer male territories that include or are near their own resting places, which they choose based on proximity to the sea, access to shade, low midday temperature and the possibility of sunbathing in the afternoon. Males with territories that are near the center of the lek tend to have a greater mating success than males with peripheral territories, but the size of a territory does not affect mating success. Large territorial males that frequently display also emit higher levels of certain acidic compounds (including 11-Eicosenoic acid) from their femoral pores, which may function as pheromones that enhance their chance of attracting females. Females can move freely between different territories, but receive less harassment from opportunistic non-territorial males when inside another male's territory. Medium-sized males attempt to mate by force and small males by stealth and force, but they have a low mating success rate compared to the large males that maintain a territory. During courtship display, a territorial male nods at the female, may open his mouth, and performs a slow sideways walk towards her. If she accepts, the male will mount her while holding her by the neck. A mating lasts no more than 20 minutes, typically 3 to 4 minutes, but it is comparatively rapid in the small \\"sneaky\\" males, which easily are overlooked because their size, general morphology and colours are similar to those of a female. This rapid mating is necessary because large males will chase them out of their territory as soon as they are discovered. During each breeding season, a male will mate with many females if given the chance, but the female only mates once. Once a female has mated, she rejects other suitors by nodding her head at them. Roughly one month after copulation, the female lays between one and six eggs, typically two or three. The leathery white eggs measure about and weigh . This is large for an iguana, and altogether the eggs may weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female. The nest sites can be as much as inland, but typically are much closer to the coast. They are occasionally as little as inland, although they have to be above the high tide water mark. The nest is deep and dug in sand or volcanic ash by the female. On islands where there are few suitable sites and digging is difficult due to a relatively hard soil and many rocks, the female guards the nest for several days after the eggs have been buried, ensuring that they are not dug up by other nesting females. As in males defending their territory from other males, females defending their nest site from other females begin with a threat display. If this fails to scare the opponent away, the fights between females involve much biting and are less ritualized than the territorial fights between males. Where there are more suitable sites and the soil is loose, females are less likely to fight for a location and do not guard their nest after the eggs have been buried. The eggs hatch after about three to four months. The hatchlings are in snout-to-vent length, and weigh . As soon as they emerge from the nest they run for cover, and begin their trip to locations that provides optimum conditions for feeding, temperature regulation and shelter. Some hatchlings have been recorded moving as far as in two days. Feeding cleaned by fish, like this Cortez rainbow wrasse. This iguana is on a rock covered in green and red algae, with the usually avoided brown algae behind it The marine iguana forages almost exclusively on red and green algae in the inter- and subtidal zones. At least 10 genera of algae are regularly consumed, including the red algae Centroceras, Gelidium, Grateloupia, Hypnea, Polysiphonia and Pterocladiella. In some populations the green algae Ulva dominates the diet. The algal diet varies depending on algal abundance, individual preferences, foraging behaviour, season and exact island of feeding. Some species with chemical deterrents, such as Bifurcaria, Laurencia and Ochtodes, are actively avoided, but otherwise algal food choice mainly depends on energy content and digestibility. On Santa Cruz Island, 4‚Äì5 red algal species are the food of choice. During neap low tides, however, the usually avoided green algae Ulva lobata is eaten more often since the preferred red algae is not easily available. Brown algae have occasionally also been recorded in their diet, but marine iguanas are unable to easily digest these and will starve if it is the only type present. A marine iguana typically eats about dry weight or fresh weight of algae per day. At Punta Espinoza on northeastern Fernandina Island it has been estimated that the almost 1,900 marine iguanas eat about 27‚Äì29 tonnes (fresh weight) of algae per year, a rate of consumption that is counterbalanced by the very high growth rate of the algae. They may feed on crustaceans, insects, and sea lion feces and afterbirth on rare occasions. The population on North Seymour Island will supplement their diet with land plants, primarily Batis maritima, or other coastal succulents like Sesuvium portulacastrum. These North Seymour iguanas have a higher survival rate during periods where their normal algal food is reduced. However, the hindgut of marine iguanas is specially adapted to algae feeding, likely restricting the possibility of efficiently switching to other plant types. The algae are digested with the help of endosymbiotic bacteria in their gut. In the first months after hatching, the juveniles mainly feed on feces from larger marine iguanas, gaining the bacteria needed for digesting algae. It has been suggested that young iguanas up to about two years old are unable to swim, but studies have shown that even newly hatched marine iguanas are good swimmers; they just strongly try to avoid entering the water. At about 1‚Äì2 years old the young may voluntarily swim in shallow water and tide pools, but they do not dive. Marine iguanas can dive as deep as , and can spend up to one hour underwater. When diving to or deeper, they regularly remain submerged from 15 to more than 30 minutes. Most dives are much shorter in duration and shallower than . Individuals foraging near-shore, often less than deep, typically only spend about 3 minutes underwater. Only 5% of marine iguanas dive for algae offshore and these individuals are the large males. The minimum size of these divers vary with island and subspecies, ranging from on Genovesa Island (A. c. nanus) to on Fernandina Island (A. c. cristatus). They are slow swimmers, averaging just . The highest recorded speed is only about twice that figure and this can typically only be sustained in bursts that last less than a minute. Most females and smaller males feed on exposed algae in the intertidal zone during low tide, retreating once the water returns and starts washing over them. They often scurry back-and-forth repeatedly, running to a patch of algae to take a few bites and then return fast to higher ground to avoid incoming waves. The separation in feeding behavior is advantageous because the large offshore feeding males experience less competition for food from smaller males and females. A few individuals of intermediate size may use both feeding strategies. In general, each marine iguana has a specific feeding site it returns to day after day. Most feed daily, but large offshore feeding males often only every second or third day. During bad weather with high waves marine iguanas do not feed, sometimes for more than a week. Large males often do not feed for several weeks when maintaining a breeding territory, resulting in them losing up to about one-quarter of their weight. It takes many months for them to return to their original weight. In captivity, individuals have remained strong and active even after fasting for as much as 100 days. Foraging behavior changes in accordance to the seasons and foraging efficiency increases with temperature. These environmental changes and the ensuing occasional food unavailability have caused marine iguanas to evolve by acquiring efficient methods of foraging in order to maximize their energy intake and body size. During an El Ni√±o cycle in which food diminished for two years, some were found to decrease their length by as much as 20%. When food supply returned to normal, iguana size followed suit. It is speculated that the bones of the iguana actually shorten as shrinkage of connective tissue could only account for a 10% change in length. Marine iguanas have several adaptions that aid their feeding. Their flattened tail is the primary means of propulsion in the water. When on the surface, they may use their legs for maintaining balance. Although their partially webbed feet often are mentioned, this webbing is very marginal and no greater in extent than in the green iguana, a species that also shares the flattened tail. Marine iguanas have powerful limbs with long, sharp claws for climbing, holding onto rocks and pulling themselves forward when at the sea bottom (adding to the propulsion provided by the tail). They are buoyant and float to the ocean surface if they are not actively swimming or holding on to rocks underwater. However, they have unusually compact (osteosclerose) limb bones compared to the land iguana, especially those from the front limbs, providing ballast to help with diving. Other adaptions in marine iguanas are blunt heads (\\"flat noses\\") and sharp teeth allowing them to easier graze algae off rocks. Together with a few Ctenosaurus species, it is the only iguana that never has more than three tips (tricuspid) on each tooth. Uniquely, the side-tips on the marine iguana's teeth are quite large, only somewhat smaller than the central tip. It also appears to replace its teeth at a higher rate than other iguanas. As a sea reptile, much salt is ingested. The salt is filtered from their blood and then excreted by specialised cranial exocrine glands at the nostrils, expelled from the body in a process much like sneezing. The marine iguana's cranium has an unusually large nasal cavity compared to other iguanas, which is necessary to accommodate the large salt glands. The head may appear white from encrusted salt. Mutualism and commensalism with other animals Lava lizards often scurry over marine iguanas when hunting flies; the iguanas generally ignore these visits Marine iguanas have mutualistic and commensal relationships with several other animals. Lava lizards may scurry over marine iguanas when hunting flies, and Darwin's finches, mockingbirds and Sally lightfoot crabs sometimes feed on mites and ticks that they pick off their skin. Marine iguanas typically ignore these visits. When underwater, they are often cleaned by fish, like Pacific sergeant majors that pick off moulting skin. Although there are no apparent benefits to either species, marine iguanas commonly live close together with the much larger Gal√°pagos sea lions. The two species generally ignore each other and an iguana may even crawl over the body of a sea lion. Thermoregulation Marine iguanas basking on Fernandina Island Marine iguanas are unique as they are marine reptiles that forage on inter- and subtidal algae almost exclusively. They forage in the relatively cold waters around the Gal√°pagos Islands, which typically are between at the sea surface. As their preferred body temperature is from and the temperature declines throughout a foraging trip to the sea, sometimes by as much as , the marine iguana has several behavioral adaptations for thermoregulation. At cold temperatures their muscles are less efficient, but their relatively high temperature preference is also related to the optimal temperature for digesting the algal food in their gut. As an ectothermic animal, the marine iguana can spend only a limited time in cold water diving for algae. Afterwards it basks in the sun to warm up. Until it can do so it is unable to move effectively, making it vulnerable to predation. However, this is counteracted by their highly aggressive nature consisting of biting and expansive bluffs when in this disadvantageous state. Their dark shade aids in heat reabsorption. In colder periods with cloudy weather and much wind, juveniles will stay in the lee of rocks, still gaining the heat from the sun. Adults may move inland to low-lying sites with less wind because of bushes and lava ridges but still exposed to direct sun. When in the water and their temperature is falling, their blood circulation is reduced because of a low heart rate of about 30 beats per minute, allowing them to better conserve their warmth. When on land and heating up, the higher heart rate of about 100 beats per minute aids in spreading the heat throughout the body. To conserve heat during the night, they often sleep closely together in groups that may number up to 50 individuals, while others sleep alone below plants or in crevices. In general, the time of each foraging trip is directly related to the water temperature; the colder the water the shorter the foraging trip. Additionally, marine iguanas that forage in or near the intertidal zone prefer to do so during low tides, allowing them to remain on land (on rocks exposed by the tide) or return to land faster. Individuals that forage further from the shore by diving are large males, which mainly feed during the hot midday (although it may occur from late morning to early evening), are less affected by the cool water because of their body size and are more efficient swimmers. Under the tropical sun, overheating can also be a problem. To avoid this, they pant, and adopt a posture where they face the sun and lift their body up, thereby exposing as little as possible of their body to direct sun and allowing cooling air to pass underneath. Conservation=Status and threats A marine iguana swimming at sea near Puerto Ayora, the most populous town in the Gal√°pagos Marine iguanas may even enter the town of Puerto Ayora, like this individual demonstrating its climbing ability on a wall. The marine iguana has a relatively small range and is currently considered vulnerable by the IUCN. Most subpopulations have the same IUCN rating, but those of San Crist√≥bal, Santiago and Genovesa Islands are considered endangered. On some shorelines they can be very numerous, with densities as high as 8,000 per kilometer (almost 13,000 per mile), and their biomass compared to the area they occupy may surpass that of any known reptile. However, their distribution is patchy, and colonies are generally found within of the ocean, naturally limiting their range. The total population for the entire archipelago is estimated to be 200,000‚Äì300,000 individuals, although this number is labelled with considerable uncertainty. Most subpopulations have not been surveyed in detail because their lifestyle and habitat make it difficult to survey with a high level of accuracy. By far the largest subpopulation‚Äîlikely including around of all marine iguanas‚Äîlives on Fernandina Island, but estimates vary greatly from 15,000 to 120,000 individuals. In contrast, the maximum size of the subpopulations on the islands of San Crist√≥bal, Darwin and Pinzon is estimated to be 400, 800 and 900, respectively. It is estimated that Marchena Island has 4,000‚Äì10,000 marine iguanas, Rabida Island has 1,000‚Äì2,000 and Santa F√© Island has 15,000‚Äì30,000. Although individuals may on occasion be transferred between islands by ocean currents, marine iguanas are unable to swim between all but the nearest islands in the archipelago because of their slow speed and limited stamina in the relatively cold water. The periodic El Ni√±o events reduce the cold water needed for algae to grow and this can drastically reduce the marine iguana population, on some islands with as much as 90%. Population recoveries after El Ni√±os are fast; even when reduced by 30‚Äì50%, the population is generally able to recover within four years. However, recoveries can be partially impeded by the invasive brown algae Giffordia mitchelliae. When their food algae (red and green algae) disappears during El Ni√±os, the areas may be taken over by this brown algae, causing starvation among the marine iguanas. With global warming, it is expected that El Ni√±o events will be stronger and occur more frequently. Introduced predators, to which they have little or no protection, include animals such as pigs, dogs, cats and rats. Dogs may take adult marine iguanas, while the others may feed on their young or eggs. This inhibits reproduction and the long-term survival of the species. Introduced predators represent a major problem on the islands of Santa Cruz, Santiago, Isabela, Floreana and San Crist√≥bal where very few marine iguana hatchlings survive. Marine iguanas are ecologically na√Øve and have not developed efficient anti-predator strategies against the introduced species. For example, the first dogs were introduced to the Gal√°pagos Islands more than 100 years ago, but marine iguanas have not developed an anti-predator strategy against them. In general, native predators represent a less serious threat to the marine iguana. Natural land predators include the Gal√°pagos hawk, short- eared owl, lava gull, herons and Gal√°pagos racer snakes that may take small marine iguanas. When swimming, marine iguanas are occasionally attacked and eaten by sharks, although the two often behave indifferently to each other, even when close together. Of the native predators, the Gal√°pagos hawk is likely the most important, and it may also take weakened adults (not just young), but this hawk is quite rare with a total population numbering only a few hundred individuals. Marine iguanas have anti-predator strategies that reduce the impact of the Gal√°pagos hawk, including an increased vigilance when hearing the alarm call of the Gal√°pagos mockingbird, another species that is sometimes preyed upon by the hawk. Marine iguanas can easily be approached by humans as they are very tame and generally make little or no attempt to escape. Individuals that have been caught before are only slightly more wary when again encountering humans. Even when repeatedly caught and deliberately mishandled each time, they do not attempt to bite or lash with their tail in self-defense (although the sharp claws can cause painful scratches when the iguana attempts to gain a grip) and only move a few feet once released, allowing themselves to be caught again with ease. Pathogens introduced to the archipelago by humans pose a serious threat to this species. The marine iguana has evolved over time in an isolated environment and lacks immunity to many pathogens. As a result, the iguanas are at higher risk of contracting infections, contributing to their threatened status. Occasional oil spills in the region also present a threat. For example, the Santa F√© population was reduced by almost as a result of the MV Jessica oil spill in 2001, and even low-level oiling may kill marine iguanas. It is suspected that the primary cause of death during these events is starvation due to the loss of their sensitive gut bacteria, which they rely on to digest algae. Protection Sign at Tortuga Bay warning people to not disturb the marine iguanas and keep a distance of at least The marine iguana is completely protected under the laws of Ecuador, and is listed under CITES Appendix II. Almost all its land range is in the Gal√°pagos National Park (only the 3% human-inhabited sections in the archipelago are excluded) and all its sea range is in the Gal√°pagos Marine Reserve. Certain coastal roads have lower speed limits to reduce the risk posed by cars, especially to the young. There have been attempts of removing introduced predators from some places, but this has not been without problems. Feral dogs mostly feed on large marine iguanas, but also limit the feral cat population. When feral dogs are removed feral cats can thrive and they feed on small marine iguanas. In 2012, the last black rats were eradicated from Pinz√≥n Island. Studies and research have been done on marine iguanas that can help and promote conservation efforts to preserve the endemic species. Monitoring levels of marine algae, both dimensionally and hormonally, is an effective way to predict the fitness of the marine iguana species. Exposure to tourism affects marine iguanas, and corticosterone levels can predict their survival during El Ni√±o events. Corticosterone levels in species measure the stress that they face in their populations. Marine iguanas show higher stress-induced corticosterone concentrations during famine (El Ni√±o) than feast conditions (La Ni√±a). The levels differ between the islands, and show that survival varies throughout them during an El Ni√±o event. The variable response of corticosterone is one indicator of the general public health of the populations of marine iguanas across the Gal√°pagos Islands, which is a useful factor in the conservation of the species. Another indicator of fitness is the levels of glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoid release is considered beneficial in helping animals survive stressful conditions, while low glucocorticoid levels are an indicator of poor body condition. Species undergoing a large measure of stress, resulting in elevated glucocorticoid levels can cause complications such as reproduction failure. Human activity has been considered a cause of elevated levels of glucocorticoid in species. Results of a study show that marine iguanas in areas central to tourism are not chronically stressed, but do show lower stress response compared to groups undisturbed by tourism. Tourism, thus, does affect the physiology of marine iguanas. Information of glucocorticoid levels are good monitors in predicting long term consequences of human impact. Although marine iguanas have been kept in captivity, the specialised diet represents a challenge. They have lived for more than a decade in captivity, but have never bred under such conditions. The development of a captive breeding program (as already exists for the Gal√°pagos land iguana) possibly is a necessity if all the island subspecies are to survive.

It is most commonly known as the snake plant, Saint George's sword, mother-in- law's tongue, and viper's bowstring hemp, among other names. Until 2017, it was known under the synonym Sansevieria trifasciata. Description It is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, spreading by way of its creeping rhizome, which is sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal rosette. Mature leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range from long and wide, though it can reach heights above in optimal conditions. The specific epithet trifasciata means \\"three bundles\\". The plant exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide using the crassulacean acid metabolism process, which allows them to withstand drought. The microscopic pores on the plant's leaves, called the stomata and used to exchange gases, are only opened at night to prevent water from escaping via evaporation in the hot sun. As a result, stored oxygen is released at the opening of the stomata at night, unlike most plants which continuously exchange gases during the day. It is a weed in some parts of northern Australia. Common names Dracaena trifasciata is commonly called \\"mother-in-law's tongue\\", \\"Saint George's sword\\" or \\"snake plant\\", because of the shape and sharp margins of its leaves. It is also known as the \\"viper's bowstring hemp\\", because it is one of the sources for plant fibers used to make bowstrings. It is known as h«îwƒõil√°n (ËôéÂ∞æÂÖ∞ or ËôéÂ∞æËò≠, \\"tiger's tail orchid\\") in China; lengua de vaca (cow‚Äôs tongue) in Puerto Rico; tora no o („Å®„Çâ„ÅÆ„Åä, \\"tiger's tail\\") in Japan; and pa≈üa kƒ±lƒ±cƒ± (\\"pasha's sword\\") in Turkey. In Portugal and Brazil, it is known as espada de S√£o Jorge (\\"sword of Saint George\\"). In the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium), the plant is also known as \\"vrouwentong\\" (women's tongue). In Russia it is known as \\"—Ç—ë—â–∏–Ω —è–∑—ã–∫\\" (\\"mother-in-law's tongue\\") and \\"—â—É—á–∏–π —Ö–≤–æ—Å—Ç\\" (\\"pike's tail\\"). Cultivation and uses Like some other members of its genus, D. trifasciata yields bowstring hemp, a strong plant fiber once used to make bowstrings. In flower Flowering D. trifasciata It is now used predominantly as an ornamental plant, outdoors in warmer climates, and indoors as a houseplant in cooler climates. It is popular as a houseplant because it is tolerant of low light levels and irregular watering; during winter it needs only one watering every couple of months. It will rot easily if overwatered. It is commonly recommended to beginners interested in cultivating houseplants for its easy care. dwarfed cultivar In cultivation The NASA Clean Air Study found D. trifasciata has potential to filter indoor air, removing 4 of the 5 main toxins involved in the effects of sick building syndrome. However, its rate of filtration is too slow for practical indoor use. It can be propagated by cuttings or by dividing the rhizome. The first method has the disadvantage that the variegation will be lost. D. trifasciata is considered by some authorities as a potential weed in Australia, although widely used as an ornamental, in both the tropics outdoors in both pots and garden beds and as an indoor plant in temperate areas. The plant contains saponins which are mildly toxic to dogs and cats and can lead to gastrointestinal upset if consumed. Varieties and cultivars Numerous cultivars have been selected, many of them for variegated foliage with yellow or silvery-white stripes on the leaf margins. Popular cultivars include 'Compacta', 'Goldiana', 'Hahnii', 'Laurentii', 'Silbersee', and 'Silver Hahnii'. 'Hahnii' was discovered in 1939 by William W. Smith, Jr. in the Crescent Nursery Company, New Orleans, Louisiana. The 1941 patent was assigned to Sylvan Frank Hahn, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The variety D. trifasciata var. laurentii, together with the cultivars 'Bantel's Sensation' and 'Golden Hahni' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Cultural significance In its native range in Africa, a yellow-tipped cultivar is associated with Oya, the female Orisha of storms. In Nigeria it is commonly linked with Ogun, the Orisha of war, and is used in rituals to remove the evil eye. In Brazil its common name Espada de S√£o Jorge links it to Saint George, who by syncretism is also associated with Orisha Ogun.

Traditionally, it is held that Toplady drew his inspiration from an incident in the gorge of Burrington Combe in the Mendip Hills in England. Toplady, a preacher in the nearby village of Blagdon, was travelling along the gorge when he was caught in a storm. Finding shelter in a gap in the gorge, he was struck by the title and scribbled down the initial lyrics. The fissure that is believed to have sheltered Toplady () is now marked as the \\"Rock of Ages\\", both on the rock itself and on some maps, and is also reflected in the name of a nearby tea shop. The German translation is called \\"Fels des Heils\\".  Commentary on lyrics  Augustus Toplady \\"When my eyes shall close in death\\" was originally written as \\"When my eye-strings break in death\\". There has been speculation that, though Toplady was a Calvinist, the words, \\"Be of sin the double cure, Save from wrath, and make me pure,\\" suggest that he agreed with the teachings of the Methodist preacher under whom he received his religious conversion, and of his contemporary, John Wesley, who taught the \\"double cure\\", in which a sinner is saved by the atonement of Jesus, and cleansed from inbred sin by the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Toplady's own published hymnal of 1776, however, contains a variant which reads: \\"Be of sin the double cure, Save me from its guilt and power\\". Music settings \\"Rock of Ages\\" is usually sung to the hymn tune \\"Toplady\\"Toplady tune in mp3, organ only with four verses by Thomas Hastings or \\"Redhead 76\\", also called Petra,Petra tune in mp3, organ only with four verses by Richard Redhead or \\"New City Fellowship\\" by James Ward. \\"Toplady\\" is most typical in the United States and \\"Redhead 76\\" in the United Kingdom, although both tunes circulate in the churches of both countries. Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee; Let the water and the blood, From Thy riven side which flowed, Be of sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt and power. Not the labour of my hands Can fulfill Thy law's demands; Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow, All for sin could not atone; Thou must save, and Thou alone. Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling; Naked, come to Thee for dress; Helpless, look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Saviour, or I die!''' While I draw this fleeting breath, When mine eyes shall close in death, When I soar to worlds unknown, See Thee on Thy judgement throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.

Uses The hymn was a favourite of Prince Albert, who asked it to be played to him on his deathbed, as did Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart. It was also played at the funeral of William Gladstone. In Chapter IX of MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \\"Andersonville\\" (1955), prisoners at the Civil War camp at Belle Isle sing the hymn to commemorate the death of a comrade. In his book Hymns That Have Helped, W. T. Stead reported \\"when the SS London went down in the Bay of Biscay, 11 January 1866, the last thing which the last man who left the ship heard as the boat pushed off from the doomed vessel was the voices of the passengers singing \\"Rock of Ages\\". The opening lines of the hymn are used in the chorus of \\"Birmingham\\" by the band Shovels & Rope. Other 1980s British rock band Def Leppard were inspired by the ancient hymn's text when a member of a choir left their hymn book in their recording studio. Joe Elliott later wrote the lyrics to their song \\"Rock of Ages\\" after reading it and in their music video the band members dress up as monks. This hymn tune was featured throughout the Westminster location in the game Assassin's Creed: Syndicate. It is heard from the music boxes as well atop Buckingham Palace at the vantage point. This hymn was regarded as one of the Great Four Anglican Hymns of the 19th century. Johannes Maas, a leader in the faith movement, commented on this hymn, \\"The words of this hymn are among the most profound, inspiring, encouraging, sacred, devotional and precious words ever penned.\\" In his score for Altered States, John Corigliano made reference to this hymn many times, to symbolise the religious struggle of the hero and the memories of his anti- religious father, which figures in one of his hallucinations. A large rounded stalagtite in Carlsbad Caverns is named \\"Rock of Ages.\\" Rangers leading tours would stop there, turn out the lights, and lead the group in singing the hymn. Translations The hymn has appeared in other languages including German (as \\"Fels der Ewigkeit\\") and Swedish (\\"Klippa, du som brast f√∂r mig\\"). There were also Latin translations by William Gladstone as \\"Jesus, pro me perforatus\\" and by Canadian linguist Silas Tertius Rand as \\"Rupes saeculorum, te.\\"Littell's Living Age, November 1882. It originally appeared in The Spectator in the late 1850s. On reading this version, Gladstone wrote to Rand, \\"I at once admit that your version is more exact than mine\\". This hymn was also translated to Tamil, a south Indian language spoken by nearly by 120 million people. The hymn is included in Christhu Sabai Paamalai, the hymnal of the Church of South India (CSI) headquartered in Chennai. It is titled Pilavunda malaye and is hymn number 350. This hymn was also translated to Telugu, a south Indian language spoken by nearly eighty million people. The hymn is included in Andhra Christava Keerthanalu, the hymnal of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church headquartered in Guntur. It is titled Naakai cheelcha badda and is hymn number 342. It was translated into Mizo (a language of northeast India) by Rev. Rohmingliana as Chatuan lungpui, aw Krista and appears in a hymnbook called Kristian Hlabu.

On 2 May 2010, he was canonized as a saint by the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church.\\"Special Communique of the Holy Assembly of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church\\", The Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America, April 29, 2010 In English, his name is sometimes spelled as Iustin Popovich. Early life Popoviƒá was born to Spiridon (a sexton) and Anastasija Popoviƒá, in the southern Serbian town of Vranje, the day before the Feast of Annunciation (by the Julian Calendar), on 6 April 1894. At his baptism, he was given the name Blagoje, after the Feast of the Annunciation (Blagovest means Annunciation or Good News). He was born into a priestly family, as seven previous generations (not including his father Spiridon) of the Popoviƒás (Popoviƒá in Serbian actually means \\"family or a son of a priest\\") were headed by priests.Christodoulou, Alexandros. \\"Saint Justin Popoviƒá, the ‚ÄòEvangelist‚Äô of the Mystery of the Annunciation\\", Pemptousia, March 29, 2019 He completed the nine-year studies at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Theology in 1914. In the early 20th century the School of St. Sava in Belgrade was renowned throughout the Orthodox world as a holy place of extreme asceticism as well as of a high quality of scholarship. Some of the well-known professors were the rector, Fr. Domentian; Professor Fr. Dositheus, later a bishop; Athanas Popoviƒá; and the ecclesiastical composer, Stevan Mokranjac. Still, one professor stood head and shoulders above the rest: the then hieromonk Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá, professor of philosophy and theology, the single most influential person in his life. World War I During the early part of World War I, in autumn of 1914, Blagoje served as a student nurse primarily in Shkod√´r, Ni≈° and throughout Kosovo. Unfortunately, while in this capacity, he contracted typhus during the winter of 1914 and had to spend over a month in a hospital in Ni≈°. On 8 January 1915, he resumed his duties sharing the destiny of the Serbian army from Peƒá to Skadar(during which one hundred thousand Serbian soldiers died). On January 1, 1916 he entered the monastic order in the Orthodox cathedral of Shkod√´r and took the name of St. Justin, after the great Christian philosopher and martyr for Christ, St. Justin the Philosopher. Further studies=Russia ƒÜelije Monastery. Shortly after becoming a monk, Justin, along with several other students traveled to Petrograd, Russia for a year-long study in the Orthodox Seminary there. It was here the young monk Justin first dedicated himself more fully to Orthodoxy and the monastic way of life. He learned of the great Russian ascetics: St. Anthony and Theodosius of the Caves in Kiev, St. Seraphim of Sarov, St. Sergius of Radonezh, St. John of Kronstadt and others. Oxford After his year's study and sojourn in Russia, Justin Popoviƒá entered the Theological School in Oxford, England at the prompting of his spiritual father Nikolaj. Justin studied theology in London in the period 1916-1926, but his doctoral thesis under the title \\"Filozofija i religija F. M. Dostojevskog\\" (The Philosophy and Religion of Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky) was not accepted due to its radical criticism of Western humanism, rationalism, Roman Catholicism, and anthropocentrism. It was subsequently printed in 1923 when Popoviƒá became the editor of the Orthodox journal The Christian Life. Together with his colleagues from the Oxford University he edited the periodical The Christian Life for twenty years.Calington, Phillip. \\"Speaking Painful Truth in Love: Orthodox Ecumenism and St. Justin Popovic\\", Pravoslavie, December 19, 2016 Athens In 1926 he was promoted to the title of the Doctor of Theology at the Faculty of Theology, University in Athens (his dissertation being \\"Problem liƒçnosti i saznanja po Sv. Makariju Egipatskom\\" -The Problem of Personality and Cognition According to St. Macarius of Egypt). For his course on the Lives of the Saints, Justin began to translate into Serbian the Lives of the Saints from the Greek, Syriac and Slavonic sources, as well as numerous minor works of the Fathers-homilies of John Chrysostom, Macarius, and Isaac the Syrian. He also wrote The Theory of Knowledge According to St. Isaac. From 1930 until 1932 after a short period as Professor in the Theological Academy of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in Prizren, he was an associate of Bishop Joseph (Cvijovich) of Bitola and the man tasked with reorganizing the Church of the Carpatho-Russians in Czechoslovakia. This area had seen an increase in those espousing Uniatism, where previously converted Christians of these regions started their conversion back into the Orthodox religion. Fate brought Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá, John Maximovich of Shanghai and San Francisco and Popoviƒá together in Bitola. The young Maximovich (a Russian of Serbian ancestry) was the assistant to Fr. Justin at the theological seminary there, while the Bishop of Ohrid was Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá. Belgrade Popoviƒá was chosen, in 1934, as Professor of Dogmatics at the Theological Faculty of St. Sava in Belgrade. As the professor at the University of Belgrade he was one of the founders (1938) of the Serbian Philosophical Society along with a number of noted Belgrade intellectuals, including Branislav Petronijeviƒá, Toma ≈Ωivanoviƒá (1884‚Äì1971), Milo≈° ƒêuriƒá (1892‚Äì1967), Prvo≈° Slankamenac, Vladimir Dvornikoviƒá, Jelisaveta Brankoviƒá, Zagorka Miƒáiƒá, Kajica Milanov, Nikola Popoviƒá and others. He was also the professor of Dogmatics at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology of the University of Belgrade from 1934 until 1945, until World War II. In 1945, with the establishment of the communist state and state atheism, Father Justin's anti- communism and efforts to convert others to Christianity had little place. The Communist regime After World War II, Popoviƒá was considered ineligible by the Communist party to continue as a professor at the seminary. Together with a few fellow professors, he was ousted from the Faculty in 1945. Popoviƒá spent 31 years in the ƒÜelije Monastery under the continuous surveillance of the Communist Party police. The Communists limited his public appearances within monastic confines. While Bishop Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá was never allowed to return to Serbia and Yugoslavia after his deportation in the Dachau concentration camp, Popoviƒá was allowed to actively participate in the organization of the Serbian Orthodox Church. This is perhaps because unlike Velimiroviƒá, Popoviƒá was not a bishop but a hieromonk. A devoted monk and philosopher of the Eastern Orthodox theology, Justin Popoviƒá was a great critic of ecumenism, providing it was inclined towards relativization of God's Truth. (John Meyendorff, professor of the Academy of St. Vladimir now in Scarsdale, New York (associated with Columbia University) - and every bit as much a critic of the \\"Catholic novelties\\" and the Pope's anti-Christianity. Until the end of his life Father Justin was a dedicated creator, and it is no wonder that his work is considered as a great contribution to the Orthodox theology and he himself as the secret conscience of the Serbian Church and the entire martyr's Orthodox religion (according to John N. Karmiris, the Greek academician).His example has been invoked by the Church of Greece (in the strict sense)'s Synod banning prayers with members of other Christian denominations. Fr. Justin died the day after his birthday, 7 April 1979, on the day of the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25 by the Julian Calendar). Works * The Philosophy and Religion of F.M.

After growing up in the farm belt during the Great Depression, he envisioned the market for rental vehicles for families who wished to avoid the expense of professional transfer and storage companies and move themselves around the country. Early life Shoen (pronounced \\"shown\\") was born on February 29, 1916 in McGrath, Minnesota to Sophie (n√©e Appert) and Samuel J. Shoen. His father moved the family to Oregon in 1923 to farm in the Willamette Valley near Shedd. His father was ethnically Scottish and English; his mother was of Swiss and French descent. Shoen worked his way through Oregon State College by running a chain of beauty parlors and barber shops in Corvallis and nearby Albany, and later at Camp Adair north of Corvallis and at the Hanford Reservation in Washington. Sam earned a B.Sc. in General Science (a pre-med degree) from OSC in 1943,Private communication with the Oregon State University Alumni Office on 21 Feb 2012. and entered the University of Oregon Medical School in Portland. Shoen was suspended from medical school during his fourth year after he \\"called out present during a roll-call for an absent classmate\\", and never returned. Shoen served in the U.S. Navy as a Hospital Apprentice First Class in Bayview, Idaho and Seattle, and was given a medical discharge in 1945 for rheumatic fever.L.S.

After starting the U-Haul Company, Shoen earned an LL.B. at the Northwestern College of Law, later known as the Lewis & Clark Law School, in Portland in 1955.Private communication with the Lewis & Clark College Alumni Office on 29 Feb 2012. Founder of U-Haul Shoen began his career as a barber. One of many U-Haul trucks In 1945, at the age of 29, Shoen co-founded U-Haul with his wife, Anna Mary Carty (1922-1957), in Ridgefield, Washington, just north of Vancouver. Anna Mary was the mother of Shoen's first six children. The company was started with an investment of $5,000. In the early years, the Shoens routinely worked 16-hour days, and reinvested all their earnings back into the business. He began building rental trailers at the Carty Ranch in Ridgefield, owned by his parents-in-law, and splitting the fees for their use with gas station owners whom he franchised as agents. The first U-Haul Rental Agent was a Mobil station on Interstate St. in Portland. These early deals were based on little more than a wink and a nod. He developed one-way rentals and enlisted investors as partners in each trailer as methods of growth. In 1951, Shoen reorganized the U-Haul Trailer Rental Company under a new holding company, ARCOA (Associated Rental Companies of America) Inc. By 1955, there were more than 10,000 U-Haul trailers on the road and the brand was nationally known. The corporate offices were in Portland, until a 1967 relocation to Phoenix, Arizona. While distracted to some extent by growing his business, Shoen also managed multiple marriages after the death of his first wife from a congenital heart defect, and eventually had a total of 12 children, each of whom he made a stockholder. Shoen married Suzanne Gilbaugh in 1958, and they had five more children. Shoen divorced Gilbaugh, and married Suzanne Whitmore in 1978 to have one last child. Some observers say that Shoen saw it as his duty to confer upon his children the fruits of his labors, others say it was to avoid taxes. In either case, he had transferred all but 2% of control to his children when 2 of them, Joe and Mark launched a successful takeover of the business in 1986. In the 1960s, Shoen diversified his holdings by creating Amerco Inc., from Advanced Management Engineering and Research Company. He pronounced the acronym, \\"a miracle.\\" Personal life and death Shoen resided in Las Vegas, Nevada. He died on October 4, 1999, at the age of 83, when he crashed his car into a telephone pole near his Las Vegas Valley, Nevada home in what was ruled by the Clark County Coroner's office as a suicide. Shoen was survived by his fifth wife, Carol, and all his children.

The opening is an offshoot of the normally staid Four Knights Game and is defined by the moves: :1. e4 e5 :2. Nf3 Nc6 :3. Nc3 Nf6 :4. Nxe5 The theoretician Oskar Cordel reported in 1888 that Leipzig club players used the opening to dangerous effect, but he did not believe it was . Their name for it, Gambit M√ºller und Schulze, was not after any players by those names, but rather a jocular German equivalent of \\"Smith and Jones\\", or, \\"Tom, Dick, and Harry\\". The modern name \\"Halloween Gambit\\" was given by the German player Steffen Jakob, who explained that \\"Many players are shocked, the way they would be frightened by a Halloween mask, when they are mentally prepared for a boring Four Knight's, and then they are faced with Nxe5.\\" White's objective is to seize the with pawns and drive back Black's knights. After 4... Nxe5, White usually plays 5. d4 (5.f4 does nothing for his ), after which Black can retreat the attacked knight to either g6 or c6. 5...Ng6 retreat When Black retreats 5...Ng6, White chases the f6-knight with 6.e5. Then after 6...Ng8 7.Bc4, former world champion Max Euwe recommended 7...d5 8.Bxd5 c6, contending in volume 11 of his opening series that Black has a decisive advantage. Instead of holding on to the extra piece with the usual 6...Ng8, a more logical continuation according to Eric Schiller is 6...Bb4, giving Black the better game after 7.exf6 Qxf6 with a lead in development and pressure in the center. 5...Nc6 retreat When Black retreats 5...Nc6, White chases the knight again with 6.d5. Then Black has 6...Ne5 (the Main line), or 6...Bb4 (Pinski's move). 6...Ne5 After 6...Ne5, White chases again with 7.f4. Then after 7...Ng6 the game usually continues 8.e5 Ng8 9.d6 cxd6 10.exd6 (see diagram). In this case White's attack is very dangerous, and likely to prevail in practical play, with the threat of Nb5‚Äìc7 difficult to defend satisfactorily. Precise defense may theoretically preserve Black's advantage but White has achieved his opening objectives. Pinski's 6...Bb4 GM Larry Kaufman wrote in 2004 that the M√ºller‚ÄìSchulze Gambit is by 4...Nxe5 5.d4 Nc6 6.d5 Bb4 7.dxc6 Nxe4 8.Qd4 Qe7, which he attributes to the Polish IM Jan Pinski.Larry Kaufman, The Chess Advantage in Black and White, Random House Puzzles & Games, 2004, p. 328. . In 2003 Pinski analyzed 9.Qxg7 Nxc3+ 10.Be3 Nd5+ 11.c3 Rf8 12.cxb4 Nxe3 13.fxe3 Qxb4+, concluding \\"Black is very close to winning\\".Jan Pinski, The Four Knights, Gloucester Publishers, 2003, p. 181. . White may also continue with the less risky 9.Be3. Halloween Gambit with colors reversed A similar gambit can be tried by Black: after 4.g3, Black can play 4...Nxe4 This line is arguably sounder than its White counterpart because White's 4.g3 has weakened the f3-square. Moreover, White cannot play the line recommended by Kaufman with colors reversed, because 5.Nxe4 d5 6.Nc3 d4 7.Bb5 dxc3 8.Nxe5? Qd5 9.Qe2? loses to 9...Qxh1+. However, with the pawn on g3, Nh4 is possible and it should be easier to castle.

The text contains two parts, an initial allegory, and a subsequent gnostic exposition of its meaning. The allegory is thought to have been originally a work in its own right. The text is dated to the 2nd or 3rd century and is attested Greek and Coptic. The author claims to be Peter the Apostle, and thus is pseudepigraphical. The allegory describes the tale, similar to the Parable of the Pearl in the Gospel of Matthew, of a pearl merchant who is selling a pearl at a great price (note‚Äîthis text is not to be confused with the Mormon scripture The Pearl of Great Price). The merchant is shunned by the rich but the poor attend him in droves, and learn that the pearl is kept at the home city of the merchant, \\"Nine Gates\\", rather than being carried on him. As such those who desire it must trek the arduous journey to Nine Gates. The name of the merchant is Lithargoel, which the text translates as being \\"lightweight, glistening stone\\", i.e. the merchant himself is the \\"pearl\\". Ultimately the merchant reveals himself to be Jesus.

Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with Indian nationalism (swadeshi) and led by Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like E. B. Havell, the principal of the Government College of Art, Kolkata from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the modern Indian painting. The Bengal school arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the academic art styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Raja Ravi Varma and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havell attempted to reform the teaching methods at the Calcutta School of Art by encouraging students to imitate Mughal miniatures. This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist Abanindranath Tagore, a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \\"materialism\\" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, Bharat Mata (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a pan-Asianist model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were Nandalal Bose, M.A.R Chughtai, Sunayani Devi (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), Manishi Dey, Mukul Dey, Kalipada Ghoshal, Asit Kumar Haldar, Sudhir Khastgir, Kshitindranath Majumdar, Sughra Rababi, . The Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of modernist ideas in the 1920s. , there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs. Bimal Sil' was a contemporary of Abanindernath Tagore. He painted in water colours. His paintings are found in private collections only. Legacy Bengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art & Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Amit Sarkar, Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan and Ratan Acharya. Some of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are Jogen Chowdhury, Mrinal Kanti Das, Gopal Sanyal, Ganesh Pyne, Manishi Dey, Shanu Lahiri, Ganesh Haloi Jahar Dasgupta, Samir Aich, Bikash Bhattacharjee, Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and Devajyoti Ray. Sanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years. R. Siva Kumar's disagreement  R. Siva Kumar, who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the- lived-world-ii/ His ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism.

He was the Archbishop of Perth from 1981 to 2005 and Primate of the Anglican Church of Australia from 2000 until May 2005. He ordained the first women priests in Australia. In the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours list, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia.Honours a celebration of lifetime achievements, 11 June 2007, The West Australian. Retrieved on 1 August 2009. He is married to Ann Carnley.Anglican Communion Directory, March 2000 Education and teaching Carnley was born in New Lambton, New South Wales. He studied in Australia at Trinity College, Melbourne and in England at Emmanuel College and St John's College, Cambridge, and became warden of St John's College at the University of Queensland, as well as lecturer in theology at the University of Queensland, before becoming a bishop. As a lecturer in the 1970s he experimented with Process Theology. He holds many honorary doctorates and a Lambeth DD (2012) and is an honorary fellow of Trinity College (Melbourne), Emmanuel College (Cambridge) and St John's College (Cambridge). Ordination of women Carnley was consecrated a bishop on 26 May 1981 at St George's Cathedral, Perth and installed there as Archbishop of Perth and Metropolitan of Western Australia in the same service. In the 1980s he supported the ordination of women and, on 7 March 1992, he ordained the first women priests in the Anglican Church of Australia at St George's Cathedral, Perth. His sermon on the occasion took as its reference an autobiographical piece by Charlotte Perkins Gilman entitled The Yellow Wallpaper. Carnley used Gilman's account of the self-destruction consequent on a \\"benignly prescribed, submissive, middle-class role\\" demanded of women in the 19th century to consider the \\"implications of the philosophy that women should \\"stay in their place, maintaining silence, concealing problems and repressing creativity\\". The yellow wallpaper of the title is what the imprisoned protagonist in Gilman's story peels off the walls as she goes mad. Carnley used it as a metaphor for the situation of the women who had been waiting to be allowed to become priests, saying: \\"Today, we are peeling away the sickly yellow, faded, silverfish-ridden wallpaper with which the church has surrounded itself and imprisoned women for centuries past in its benign and perhaps well-meaning determination to confine them by role.\\" Ecumenism From 2004 he served as co-chair of the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC II) seeking greater unity between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion. He served as Distinguished Visiting Professor in systematic theology at the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church in New York City for from 2010 to 2013. In 2001, amid questions about the possibility of the church celebrating same-sex marriages, Carnley suggested that the church might be able to bless gay \\"friendships\\". Later, Carnley acknowledged that the consecration of American Bishop Gene Robinson created controversy in the church, but predicted that the church would not be irreparably split over the issue. Controversy In The structure of resurrection belief Carnley outlines several different ways Christians frame their belief in the resurrection of Christ and the way the resurrection frames their faith. He explores notions of the resurrection as an historical event, as an eschatological event and as a non-event. He also explores the role of memory, presence and faith in believing in the resurrection. When Carnley became the Australian primate, his views caused controversy with some, especially in the conservative Diocese of Sydney, where Archbishop Harry Goodhew accused Carnley of breaching church doctrine and betraying the church's belief in the significance of the resurrection and of Jesus Christ himself. Others, including Phillip Jensen, Rector of St Matthias, Centennial Park in Sydney, objected to comments about how the Christian belief in the uniqueness of Christ had been misused to persecute people of other faiths. Some church leaders, especially within the Diocese of Sydney, called for a boycott of Carnley's installation as Primate, but Archbishop Goodhew rejected such calls, which he said would be tantamount to severing relations with the rest of the church. Carnley says he believes in the uniqueness of Christ: \\"I think Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life, but that doesn't mean that other religions don't have any truth at all.\\"Controversy over new Anglican primates views, 26 April 2000, 7.30 Report, abc.net.au. Retrieved on 1 August 2009. He also says he has an Easter (or resurrection) faith in the real presence of the living Jesus: \\"The Christian story, which pre-eminently transmits and celebrates the memory of Jesus and God‚Äôs revelatory deed in and through his life and death, should lead us beyond itself to a living encounter with the real presence of all that it celebrates and rehearses: him, whom by story we recall, we actually know as the living Spirit of the fellowship of faith.\\"The Structure of Resurrection Belief (Clarendon Press, 1987) p364 He also asserted that the resurrection is \\"the miracle of the Christian tradition\\".

The group formed in Pittsburgh's South Oakland neighborhood in 1999 as an informal side project of Dean Swagger, a rock trio that had spent the previous year mainly performing in basements to college party crowds. The original lineup consisted of guitarist Phil Boyd and drummer Paul Quattrone, then nominally students at the University of Pittsburgh. The group made its first appearances at the Halloween weekend in 1999 and played a live set on WPTS 92.1 FM, the University of Pittsburgh college radio station, segments of which later turned up on the group's demo album, House on the Hill (and, subsequently, its 2002 self-titled release). By 2000, the duo had gained a reputation around Pittsburgh for its concerts. Modey Lemon, the group's debut album, appeared in early 2002, and the band supported the album with tours of the US and Europe. The group followed their self-titled release with a brief stint on In the Red Records, which released a double 7 inch record, before recommending the band to Birdman Records owner Dave Katznelson, who then signed the band. Prior to the mid-2003 release of second album Thunder + Lightning, Boyd and Quattrone added Jason Kirker on guitar and Moog synthesizer. Following the US release of Thunder + Lighting the band signed with Mute Records, which licensed and released the album in the UK and Europe, and via EMI (Mute's parent label) in Japan. The single releases, \\"Crows\\" (2004, #75) and \\"Sleepwalkers\\" (2005, #71), each appeared in the UK Singles Chart for one week. Their third album The Curious City was released in August 2005 on Birdman/Mute. Modey Lemon has performed with The White Stripes, The Von Bondies (2002 UK tour), Girl Talk, the Blues Explosion, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Oneida (2005 Europe tour), The Warlocks (2003 UK Tour), Icarus Line (2004 UK tour), Dinosaur Jr. (2005 tour dates in UK/Europe/US), Arctic Monkeys (2009 US tour), and has played festivals such as Glastonbury (2005), ArthurFest (2005), Meredith Music Festival (2003), and Transmusicales (2004). In 2006, the band appeared in a 'punk club' scene in the film adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, performing two original songs written for the film as well as two cover songs. The band released their fourth album Season of Sweets on May 12, 2008. The band also completed a tour of the US in June and July that year and a tour of the UK and mainland Europe in September. In August 2009 the band supported the Arctic Monkeys in New York City, Boston, and Chicago. In October 2009, it was announced that their track \\"Become a Monk\\" from the band's album Season of Sweets, would be included on the soundtrack of the video game, Tony Hawk: Ride. In 2010 Modey Lemon recorded and released one single \\"Wandering Eye b/w Cheetahs for Chariots\\" on These Are Not Records and performed once at the University of Pittsburgh's William Pitt Union in spring 2010 before going on indefinite hiatus. In 2015, Modey Lemon's first two albums \\"House on the Hill\\" and Modey Lemon (album) were reissued on vinyl for the first time on A-F Records, Mind Cure Records, and Omentum Records.

It is made of the milk of goats, sheep, or cows, or a mixture of these., \\"Characteristics of major traditional regional cheese varieties of East-Mediterranean countries: a review\\", Efstathios Alichanidis & Anna Polychroniadou, Dairy Sci–µnce & Technology, Volume 88, Number 4‚Äì5, July‚ÄìOctober 2008 It is slightly crumbly, with at least 46‚Äì48% of dry matter containing 44‚Äì48% of fat. It is commonly produced in blocks, and has a slightly grainy texture. It is used as a table cheese, in salads, and in baking. Recipes Sirene, together with yogurt, is a national food of all the countries in the Balkans, with many national and regional variations. Traditional dishes using sirene are: Soups: Potato or vegetable soup with sirene (—Å–∏—Ä–µ–Ω—è–≤–∞ —á–æ—Ä–±–∞). Products for preparation of Bulgarian Shopska salad (including Sirene). Salads: Shopska salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, onions and sirene. Ovcharska salad (\\"shepherd's salad\\") with the above-mentioned vegetables, cheese, ham, boiled eggs and olives. Tomatoes with sirene is a traditional light salad during the summer. Eggs: Fried eggs and omelettes with sirene.

Kachamak (the local variant of cornmeal, polenta or the Romanian mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ) is always eaten with sirene. Pastry: The traditional banitsa and other kinds of pastry are also made with sirene. Stuffed peppers are more often stuffed with rice, but are also made with sirene-and-eggs filling. Also it is consumed as an appetizer.  Similar cheeses in other countries  Many Balkan and other cheeses are similar to (but not the same as) sirene, and are known by various names. The local consumers of each country are usually well- aware of the differences between the various white cheeses. Part of the differences are that the breeds of sheep and goats in each region are different, and their feed may have specific regional characteristics that affect the taste and texture of cheese made from their milk. * Albania: djath√´ i bardh√´ - 'white cheese' * Czech Republic: Balk√°nsk√Ω s√Ωr - 'Balkan cheese' * Greece: Feta - Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) * Iran: Tabrizi paneer - 'Cheese of Tabriz' * Israel: Bulgarit (◊ë◊ï◊ú◊í◊®◊ô◊™) - 'Bulgarian (cheese)' * Lebanon: Bulghari (ÿ®ŸÑÿ∫ÿßÿ±Ÿä) - 'Bulgarian (cheese)' * Mexico: Cotija cheese * Romania: Telemea * Russia: Bryndza (–ë—Ä—ã–Ω–∑–∞) * Turkey: Beyaz peynir - 'white cheese' * Ukraine: Bryndza (–±—Ä–∏–Ω–∑–∞) See also * Kashkaval * List of cheeses References Category:Bulgarian cheeses Category:Serbian cheeses Category:Sheep's-milk cheeses Category:Cow's-milk cheeses Category:Lebanese cuisine Category:Iranian cuisine Category:Israeli cuisine ","title":"Sirene"},{"id":"1864812","text":"The Rhetoric of Hitler's \\"Battle\\" is an influential essay written by Kenneth Burke in 1939 which offered a rhetorical analysis of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany. Much of Burke's analysis focuses on Hitler's Mein Kampf (\\"my struggle\\"). Burke (1939; reprinted in 1941 and 1981) identified four tropes as specific to Hitler's rhetoric: inborn dignity, projection device, symbolic rebirth, and commercial use. Several other tropes are discussed in the essay, \\"Persuasion\\" (Burke: 1969). Tropes=Common enemy One trope is the idea of the common enemy. Without an enemy with a mindless determination to destroy everything good and beautiful, all states struggle with the economic and social problems of unemployment and poverty. The idea of a common enemy is thus a symbol of the evil against which people must unite, and it distracts the people from politically-inconvenient issues by relating all evils to the common rhetorical enemy. According to Burke, that creates an antithesis. We are born separate individuals and divided by class or other criteria and so identification is a compensation to division. (Burke, 1969, p. 22). He sees that human need to identify with or belong to a group as providing a rich resource for those interested in joining us or, more importantly, persuading us. To promote social cohesion, antithesis makes a simple balancing statement, \\"We do this\\" but \\"They do that\\". The symmetry creates an expression of conjoined opposites, which stigmatises the latter and encourages the former to cohere by doing only \\"this\\". At first, the enemy may be local politicians or other voices that might criticise the protagonist's actions. Then, all opposing voices are seen as antithetical to unity: without a united voice, the outside enemies will gain the upper hand. If the nation goes to war, fascism requires everybody in society and every aspect of society to be involved in the war effort and machine and so the society fights as one organism under the leader. Geographical materialization All roads lead to Rome. In Ancient Rome, that was literally and metaphorically true. All roads radiate from the capital of the Roman Empire, and all tribute and authority were owed to the Emperors. That is a form of cognitive mapping, which associates inspiring ideology and strong leadership with a particular location. Hence, Hitler promoted Munich as the place to which all roads must lead, with geography materializing the ideology of fascism. Unifying voice The unification rhetoric demands a unifying voice: the entire nation must speak as one person. That is the essence of the authoritarian ideal and produces a totalitarian one-party state. Projection devices Projection devices are scapegoating tactics which personalise the initially-vague threats posed by the common enemy. At a social level, the internal problems of unemployment and poor trading performances are directly attributed to the activities of the \\"identified others\\". Simplification is a particularly-effective rhetorical device to deal with an uncritical population by permitting rhetoricians to rise to power through their persuasive abilities and frequently outmaneuvering those with expert knowledge who do not communicate well. In this context, Burke (1941) identified Hitler's use of apodictic argumentation in which anecdotal experiences are asserted as proof of his social analysis. Inborn dignity It is usual to define a national ideal, archetype or class of citizen as a measuring stick by which all other types of people are to be judged. The archetype will be heroic, noble, and dignified to appeal to the vanity in the majority, and the others will be subhuman and easily distinguished by reference to their ethnicity, religion, or politics. For that rhetoric to be effective, it must always address existing prejudices. Hitler proposed the Manichean antithesis of superior: inferior through the superiority of das Volk, the Aryan race, over the inferior races (\\"in particular Jews and Negroes\\"). Symbolic rebirth Wink and others identify symbolic rebirth rhetoric as allowing a people to aspire towards a new utopian society. When the scapegoat is eliminated, a rebirth will occur. The morally- negative action of elimination is justified by a positive goal of symbolic rebirth in which all ideals are realised. It will occur only once in a lifetime. Commercial use Another trope is commercial use, which offers a non-economic interpretation of economic problems that appeals to the class that will benefit the most if the competition is removed. Thus, Burke (1941) identifies Hitler's attribution of Germany's economic difficulties to \\"Jewish\\" moneylenders by suggesting that if they were removed, \\"Aryan\\" finance would be in control.

These bases are typically populated by squadrons, groups or wings, their various support commands, and other tenant commands. The term \\"Naval Air Station\\" is used by many countries' navies, such as the United States Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Navy, and the Indian Navy. In the case of the U.S. Navy, similar facilities in the U.S. Marine Corps are known as Marine Corps Air Stations and facilities in the U.S. Coast Guard are known as Coast Guard Air Stations. Argentinean Navy The Argentine Naval Aviation operates four Base Aeronaval (BAN): from BAN Punta Indio (BAPI) in Buenos Aires Province through BAN Comandante Espora (BACE) and BAN Almirante Zar (BAAZ) in Patagonia to BAN Almirante Quijada (BARD) at Tierra del Fuego. Runways also serve domestic airlines at almost all Argentine military air bases. The Navy operates Estacion Aeronaval (EAN) (stations) which have smaller crews and are not normally assigned aircraft. These include Ezeiza, Rio Gallegos and Ushuaia. The Argentine Naval Prefecture, serving as the Coast Guard, also operates air stations at Posadas, Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata, and Comodoro Rivadavia. Aircraft operating out of these bases are heavily involved in air/sea rescues.Un helic√≥ptero de la Prefectura rescat√≥ a una mujer en el R√≠o de la PlataRescate en el mar Royal Australian Navy In Australia, there is one Naval Air Station, \\"NAS Nowra\\", HMAS Albatross, and the formal Naval Aircraft Repair Yard and apprentice training establishment at HMAS Nirimba in Schofields, Sydney. French Navy In 2017, the French Naval Aviation has four naval air stations (BAN), all located in metropolitan territory. Bases d'a√©ronautique navale * BAN Lann-Bihou√© (mainly dedicated to maritime patrol) * BAN Lanv√©oc-Poulmic (mainly dedicated to helicopters) * BAN Landivisiau (mainly dedicated to carrier fighters) * BAN Hy√®res Le Palyvestre, (mainly dedicated to carrier fighters) Location Active naval air stations of the French naval air arm (status 2009). Two of them were deactivated in 2011. The BAN Tontouta was reassigned the French Air Force ; the BAN N√Æmes-Garons (and not Nimes-Garron, as indicated by error on the map) is now assigned primarily to the civil aviation (air transport) and on a secondary basis to the Ministry of Interior for Civil Security. Royal Navy The United Kingdom has two Royal Naval Air Stations (RNAS), RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron) and RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk). Until 2006, the former served as the main operating base for the Royal Navy's Sea Harriers, which were based upon the three Invincible class aircraft carriers. However, upon the withdrawal of the BAe Sea Harrier in that year, no strike aircraft have operated from there. It is believed that all of their successors will be based at RAF Lossiemouth. The site also contains the Fleet Air Arm Museum, that showcases a variety of aircraft from the Royal Naval Air Service (1914‚Äì1918) until the present day. RNAS Yeovilton also has RNAS Merryfield as its training and satellite station. RNAS Culdrose serves a variety of helicopter and fixed- wing squadrons, such as the Sea King and the Jetstream respectively. Among the features at RNAS Culdrose is the \\"Dummy deck\\" which is used to train pilots to land on ships, the Merlin training facility, and the Fleet Requirements Air Direction Unit. Its satellite airfield is RNAS Predannack. Italian Navy The Italy has three Marina Militare NAS: MARISTAELI Catania, MARISTAELI La Spezia Luni and MARISTAER Grottaglie. United States Navy In the United States, a \\"Naval Air Station\\" (NAS) is an air base of the United States Navy. When located in foreign countries, they are more specifically named US Naval Air Stations (USNAS), to avoid confusion with naval air stations used by the navies of the host countries. A slightly lower level of air base in the U.S. Navy is the Naval Air Facility. These facilities normally support smaller numbers of naval aircraft. Permanently based naval aircraft are usually minimal, with the principal focus being on supporting naval aircraft deployed from other installations. Examples are NAF Atsugi, Japan; NAF Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory; NAF El Centro, California; NAF Washington at Andrews AFB, Maryland; NAF Souda Bay, Crete; NAF Misawa at the U.S. Air Force's Misawa AB in Japan; and NAF Mildenhall at the U.S. Air Force's RAF Mildenhall installation in the United Kingdom. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions have resulted in closure of Naval Air Facilities such as NAF Detroit at Selfridge ANGB, Michigan; NAF Lajes at the U.S. Air Force's Lajes AB facility in the Azores; NAF Kadena at the U.S. Air Force's Kadena AB, Japan; NAF Adak, Alaska; and NAF Midway northwest of Hawaii. Flight line at NAS Key West, 2007 There are also a number of former Naval Air Stations that have been realigned as part of larger Naval Stations (NAVSTA) or redesignated to other functions in the Navy. This includes the former NAS Norfolk, Virginia (now part of NAVSTA Norfolk), the former NAF Mayport, Florida (now part of NAVSTA Mayport), the former NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (now part of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base); and the former NAS Lakehurst, New Jersey (redesignated as Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst). In the case of NAS Memphis, Tennessee (redesignated as Naval Support Activity Mid-South), the airfield and flight line was turned over to local civilian authorities, while the Navy retained the remainder of the installation. There are also larger facilities that are similar to Naval Air Stations and possess large airfield facilities, but were actually constructed as part of much larger facilities or were dedicated to research and development activities. This includes NAVSTA Rota, Spain; the recently closed NAVSTA Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; the still active Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, California; and the recently closed Naval Air Warfare Center Warminster, Pennsylvania. The Navy also operates a number of austere unmanned or minimally manned airfields known as Naval Auxiliary Landing Fields (NALF), Naval Outlying Landing Fields (NOLF), or more simply Outlying Fields (OLF). United States Marine Corps In the United States, a \\"Marine Corps Air Station\\" is an air base of the United States Marine Corps. When located in foreign countries, they are often identified as US Marine Corps Air Stations (USMCAS), following their US Navy counterparts (the Marine Corps falling as a service under the Department of the Navy) as that term is used by the navies of other countries. As part of Naval Aviation, Marine Corps Air Stations and Marine Corps Air Facilities fill a similar role as Naval Air Stations and Naval Air Facilities for the United States Marine Corps. Marine aviation units are also assigned on occasion as permanently based units to Naval Air Stations, Naval Air Facilities and, in rare cases, to Air Force Bases and Air National Guard Bases as well. Like the Navy, the Marine Corps also operates a number of austere unmanned or minimally manned airfields known as Marine Corps Auxiliary Landing Fields (MCALF), Marine Corps Outlying Landing Fields (MCOLF), or more simply Outlying Fields (OLF). Since the Marines' flight training is combined with the Navy and the Coast Guard, those fields dedicated to training of student aviators in the southeastern United States remain under Navy control. As a result, the Marine Corps' auxiliary fields support operational Fleet Marine Force (FMF) units for readiness purposes, such as field carrier landing practice (FCLP) for fixed- wing and rotary-wing aircraft embarking on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. United States Coast Guard The United States Coast Guard is also part of U.S. Naval Aviation and operates its own Coast Guard Air Stations and Coast Guard Air Facilities, either as stand alone installations on joint civil-military airports or Coast Guard-controlled facilities, or collocated at Naval Air Stations, Air Force Bases, Air National Guard Bases and Army Air Fields. Since the Coast Guard has no aviation facilities located in foreign countries, the service tends not use the term \\"U.S. Coast Guard Air Station\\" (USCGAS), but will use the term Coast Guard Air Station (CGAS) or more simply, \\"AIRSTA.\\" The Coast Guard also operates a number of smaller Coast Guard Air Facilities, most of which are limited to rotary-wing operations only and support a limited number of aircraft and personnel.

An alternate version exists, known as the Passion of Peter and Paul (Passio sanctorum Petri et Pauli), with variances in the introductory part of the text. Some versions have been written by a certain Marcellus, thus the anonymous author, of whom nothing further is known and is sometimes referred to as pseudo-Marcellus. The intended Marcellus is doubtless he who after the martyrdom takes the lead in burying St. Peter \\"near the Naumachia in the place called the Vatican.\\"Edmundson ref.

It assigns Peter as Paul's brother. It also describes the death of Paul by beheading, an early church tradition. Acts of Pilate The text often includes a letter purporting to be from Pilate, known as Acts of Pilate (or Epistle of Pontius Pilate).

The Latin versions sometimes end with \\"I, Marcellus, have written what I saw.\\" This Marcellus is identified as a disciple of Simon Magus, who lived in the 1st century.

Early years  Leopold Joseph Maria was born at Vienna, the son of Count Wirich Philipp von Daun (1669‚Äì1741). The Daun noble family originated from the Rhineland and derived its name from the ancestral seat at Daun south of the High Eifel range. He was intended for the church, but his natural inclination for the army, in which his father and grandfather had been distinguished generals, proved irresistible. In 1718 he served in the War of the Quadruple Alliance in Sicily, in his father's regiment. He had already risen to the rank of Oberst (Colonel) when he saw further active service in Italy and on the Rhine in the War of the Polish Succession (1734‚Äì35). He continued to add to his distinctions in the Turkish War of 1737‚Äì39, in which he attained the rank of Feldmarschallleutnant (Major-General). War of the Austrian Succession In the War of the Austrian Succession from 1740, Daun distinguished himself by the careful leadership which was afterwards his greatest military quality. In Austria's First Silesian War against Prussia, he was present at Chotusitz and Prague, and led the advanced guard of Khevenh√ºller's army in the victorious Danube campaign of 1743. Field Marshal Count Traun, who succeeded Khevenh√ºller in 1744, thought equally highly of Daun, and entrusted him with the rearguard of the Austrian army when it escaped from the French to attack Frederick the Great. He held important commands in the battles of Hohenfriedberg and Soor, and in the same year (1745) was promoted to the rank of Feldzeugmeister (Lieutenant General). After this he served in the Low Countries, and was present at the Battle of Val. He was highly valued by Maria Theresa, who made him commandant of Vienna and a Knight of the Golden Fleece, and in 1754 he was elevated to the rank of Feldmarschall (Field-Marshal). Seven Years' War During the interval of peace that preceded the Seven Years' War he was engaged in carrying out an elaborate scheme for the reorganization of the Austrian army, and it was chiefly through his efforts that the Theresian Military Academy was established at Wiener-Neustadt in 1751. When a Third Silesian War broke out, he was not actively employed in the first campaigns of the war, but in 1757 he was placed at the head of the army which was raised to relieve Prague. On 18 June 1757 Daun decisively defeated Frederick for the first time in his career in the desperately fought Battle of Kolin. In commemoration of this brilliant exploit, the queen immediately instituted a military order bearing her name, and Daun was awarded the first Grand Cross of that order. The union of the relieving army with the forces of Prince Charles at Prague reduced Daun to the position of second in command, and in that capacity he took part in the pursuit of the Prussians and the victory of Breslau. Hyacinth de La Pegna Frederick now reappeared and won the most brilliant victory of the age at Leuthen. Daun was present on that field, but was not held accountable for the disaster, and when Prince Charles resigned his command, Daun was appointed in his place. With the campaign of 1758 began the war of manoeuvre in which Daun, though missing some opportunities to crush the Prussians through over-caution, at least maintained a steady and cool resistance to the fiery strategy of Frederick. In 1758 Major-General Laudon, acting under Daun's instructions, forced the king to raise the siege of Olm√ºtz (Battle of Domstadtl), and later in the same year Daun himself surprised Frederick at the Battle of Hochkirch and inflicted a severe defeat upon him (14 October). Despite the tactical success and capture of many munitions and supplies that Daun achieved at Hochkirch, his failure to pursue Frederick allowed the Prussians to block his path into Silesia, meaning that his victory counted for little. In the following year the war of manoeuvre continued, and on 20 and 21 November he surrounded the entire corps of General Finck at Maxen, forcing the Prussians to surrender. These successes were counterbalanced in the following year by the defeat of Laudon at Liegnitz, which was attributed partly to the dilatoriness of Daun, and Daun's own subsequent defeat by Zieten's bold attack in the great Battle of Torgau. In this engagement, Daun was so severely wounded that he had to return to Vienna to recuperate. However, Daun and his forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Prussians and were able to retreat in good order. Reception Statue of Leopold Josef Graf Daun, on the Maria Theresa memorial, Vienna Daun continued to command until the end of the war, and afterwards worked with the greatest energy at the reorganization of the imperial forces. In 1762 he had been appointed president of the Hofkriegsrat. By order of Maria Theresa, a monument to his memory was erected by Balthasar Ferdinand Moll in the church of the Augustinians, with an inscription describing him as the \\"saviour of her states.\\" In 1888, the 56th Regiment of Austrian Infantry was named after him. Called the Austrian Fabius Cunctator, Daun has been criticized for the dilatoriness of his operations, but wariness was not misplaced when one faced a general like Frederick, who was quick and unpredictable. His inability to exploit a victory, on the other hand, might not be so easily excused. The relationship with his daring general Ernst Gideon von Laudon remained tense. His first cousin Eleonora Ernestina married the Marquis of Pombal, the noted Portuguese statesman.The wife of the Marquis of Pombal was actually his first cousin, not his daughter. Gr√§fin Eleonora von und zu Daun was the daughter of Graf Heinrich Reichard Lorenz von und zu Daun and Gr√§fin Maria Josepha Violante von Poymund und Payersberg. Heinrich was the son of Graf Wilhelm Johann Anton von und zu Daun and Gr√§fin Anna Maria Magdalena von Althann, who were also the parents of Graf Wirich Philipp Lorenz von Daun, Marchese di Rivoli, Principe di Teano, father of Leopold Joseph.

Tailgating, which primarily takes place in the United States, often involves consuming alcoholic beverages and grilling food. Tailgate parties occur in the parking lots at stadiums and arenas, before and occasionally after games and concerts. People attending such a party are said to be 'tailgating'. Many people participate even if their vehicles do not have tailgates. Tailgate parties also involve people bringing their own alcoholic beverages, barbecues, food etc. which is sampled and shared among fans attending the tailgate. Tailgates are intended to be non-commercial events, so selling items to the fans is frowned upon. Tailgating is often seen as a critical part of the sports experience in the United States. Because many American sports venues are surrounded by large parking lots, tailgating often takes place right outside stadium and arena entrances. Tailgate parties have spread to the pre-game festivities at sporting events besides American football, such as basketball, hockey, association football, and baseball, and also occur at non-sporting events such as weddings, barbecues, and concerts.\\"The Santa Fe Opera Tailgate: A Grand Tradition\\" Santa Fe.com (August 4, 2011) Food and drink Tailgating typically involves the consumption of alcoholic beverages or soft drinks and the grilling of various meat products. Popular tailgate party foods include picnic staples such as bratwurst, hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans, and cold salads like coleslaw or potato salad. Some food products were created because of tailgate parties. A brand of pimento cheese, called Palmetto Cheese, got its start at Atlanta Braves tailgate parties. Games A game of cornhole Lawn games such as KanJam, cornhole, ladder golf, Polish horseshoes, Louisville Chugger, Jarts, washer pitching and Sholf are very popular during tailgates and tailgate parties. Lawn games are associated with tailgating primarily because of the simplicity in the game materials. Lawn games carry the connotation of drinking games because of their presence during tailgates. Other games that are often played include beer pong and flipcup. It is also common for fans to bring sports balls such as footballs, soccer balls, and the like to casually play with. Many tailgaters have external stereos or use their car's sound system to play music, and it is not unusual to see some tailgate parties hook up a television set and antenna/satellite to an electric generator so partygoers can watch other sporting events. Local events Steeler and 2006 candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania Lynn Swann courts voters tailgating before a football game between the Steelers and the Eagles. In schools and communities throughout the United States, there are athletic departments, coaches and parents of student athletes who rely on post-game tailgating parties to build community and support for their program and team. Smaller, underfunded programs are assisted by the voluntary participation of parents and friends to feed the team and coaching staff post-competition, which establishes a strong core of support year after year. In 2007, the NFL angered many football fans by banning tailgating before the Super Bowl. The NFL cited security risks, though many suspected it had more to do with corporate sponsored events than any real threat. In 2008, an online petition began circulating to encourage the NFL to lift the no tailgating at the Super Bowl policy. Members of the sports media also questioned the validity of NFL's claim that security concerns was the real reason for the ban. In April 2019, Ontario, Canada Premier Doug Ford's staff announced the legalisation of personal alcohol consumption outside sporting venues across the province, in effect creating a framework for tailgating-style events. Many sporting venues lack large surface parking areas, though, so American-style tailgating culture is unlikely to take hold.  In popular culture  In the Simpsons episode \\"Any Given Sundance\\", Homer takes his family to a tailgate party. He makes them get up early in order to be at the stadium hours before the football game, and states that \\"the game is nothing\\", the tailgate party being the only reason for their being there. Season 3 of the Travel Channel original series Man v. Food had a tailgating special consisting of various segments from previous episodes that featured food that would make an ultimate tailgate party. A number of television commercials, especially those aired during football games, feature tailgating culture, including those for Bud Light beer and cellphones.  Nomadic tailgating  Nomadic tailgating is a variant of a traditional tailgate party. With nomadic tailgating, people carry backpack or similar bags, filled with snacks and beverages‚Äîusually alcoholic ones, like beer‚Äîand roam the tailgate parties that are held before sporting events (usually, football). The nomadic tailgater has no vehicle or \\"home base\\" of his own. Nomadic tailgating occurs where the nomadic tailgater has too many tailgate parties to attend (i.e., has several friends holding tailgate parties on a single day) or where the nomadic tailgater has no tailgate parties to attend.

Its premise is an alien invasion of Earth during World War II, and includes Turtledove's Worldwar tetralogy, as well as the Colonization trilogy, and the novel Homeward Bound. The series' time span ranges from 1942 to 2031. The early series was nominated for a Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 1996. Series premise Worldwar deals with a military invasion that begins on or around May 30, 1942 by a force of aliens that calls itself The Race, a reptilian species. It had reached Earth orbit in December 1941 but delayed the attack for various reasons. Although the Race has the advantage of superior technology, its information on humanity had been collected by robotic probe during the 12th century AD. The invaders are surprised to find that humanity progressed far more rapidly than any other species that they had previously studied and conquered. Contrary to its expectations, at the time of invasion, the Race's technology is only marginally more advanced than 20th-century Earth technology. The commander hesitates, and considers turning back without revealing The Race's presence to the humans but finally decides to avoid the disgrace of that course of action. The narrative follows the intersecting fortunes of a large number of human and alien characters. Notably, the series depicts how the Axis and Allied powers must co-operate to fight the alien menace. As is gradually revealed, the Race unified its home planet into a single state with a military technology at a level similar to our history's late 20th century. It then had tens of thousands of years of further history, but for most of the time, it fought no wars and so had no incentive or need to develop more advanced weapons. Indeed, for most of the time, it maintained no army at all. Only the discovery of other planets with intelligent beings made the Emperor proclaim a \\"Soldier's Time\\" and build up an army, and the weapons developed at the last wars when the home planet was unified were quite enough to conquer the other planets. With Earth, it turned out differently since the various human nations were faced with arms some decades ahead of theirs but were soon able to close the gap. Literary theme Turtledove approaches the novels' science fiction scenario by focusing less on the technological and fantasy elements that are typically associated with the genre. He shows more concern for the role of more mundane affairs, such as the political repercussions of an alliance between the Allied and Axis powers, the impact the presence of alien creatures has on human society, and the ways in which warfare is paradoxically a hindrance to civilization and simultaneously a catalyst for the progress of civilization. Particular attention is given to the deep dilemma facing the Jews in both Poland and Palestine. The invaders, landing in 1942, stopped the ongoing Holocaust and closed down Auschwitz - for which Jews are understandably grateful; but collaborating with the reptile invaders would brand the Jews as traitors to Humanity. First series The first series is made up of four volumes: * Worldwar: In the Balance (1994) * Worldwar: Tilting the Balance (1995) * Worldwar: Upsetting the Balance (1996) * Worldwar: Striking the Balance (1996) It ends with neither humanity nor the aliens triumphing. Instead, each side fights to the point that facing mutually-assured destruction, they settle into an uneasy ceasefire. The aliens want to colonize Earth and have nuclear weapons but want to use them only sparingly. They cannot colonize a radioactive wasteland after a full-scale nuclear exchange. The invasion ultimately ends when all of the major Allied and Axis powers manage to develop their own nuclear weapons, resulting in a stalemate. The Race is left in control of roughly half the planet, primarily colonial possessions in the Southern Hemisphere: Africa, South and Central America, Australia, and most of Asia aside from the Soviet Union and a few Japanese coastal holdings. Uneasy peace The second series of novels, set in the 1960s, deals with the interaction between surviving humans and the Race. Opening with the arrival of the colonization fleet, the series ends with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the establishment of a permanently-manned US space station in the asteroid belt. Part of the series focuses on the Reich- Race War of the mid-1960s, when the Greater German Reich and the Race fight a nuclear war. The Germans lose and are forced to allow France to become an independent nation again under a new Fourth Republic. Nonetheless, it is a costly victory for the Race: fighting Germany on its own after 20 years of human technological advancement proved to be much more difficult than fighting all free human nations earlier. It is left obvious to both sides that long- term trends are in humanity's favor. The Race is also faced with ongoing guerilla wars in much of the territory they conquered, especially by Communists in China and by Islamists in the Arab World. The Race - confirmed Conservative Monarchists who never developed any concept of Republic, and whose only religion is veneration of their Divine Emperor and the ghosts of past Emperors - find it difficult to understand either Communism or Islam, but can't deny that both are highly effective ideologies motivating humans to fight and cause considerable difficulties to their occupiers. Another major issue turns out to be ginger - an innocent flavoring in the human cuisine but a powerful narcotic for the Race's metabolism. This creates problems of addiction and helps create new criminal networks involving both humans and rogue members of the Race. Moreover, inhaling ginger causes females of the Race to become sexually active, outside of their normal mating season. This creates new problems, as the Race has no concept whatsoever of sexual activity being private, and when sexually aroused tend to engage in indiscriminate orgies, to the scandal of humans who happen to watch. For their part, members of the Race find it difficult to understand humans' insistence on sex being a private act, and the humans' great annoyance when reptiles walk in on them while engaged in it. *Colonization Trilogy **Second Contact (1999) **Down to Earth (2000) **Aftershocks (2001) Interstellar The final novel in the saga deals with humanity reaching the Race's homeworld, \\"Home\\" (Tau Ceti II). *Homeward Bound (2004) List of characters The following is a list of some of the major characters from the series.

It was mostly given to civil servants and military officers, as well as those upon whom the lower rank of an Order had been conferred. The noun Edler comes from the adjective edel (\\"noble\\"), and translated literally means \\"noble [person]\\". In accordance with the rules of German grammar, the word can also appear as Edle, Edlem, or Edlen depending on case, gender, and number. Heraldic crown of Edler, with five visible pearls Originally, from the Middle Ages, under the feudal system (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were generally those who held a fief, often in the form of heritable land worked by vassals. To preserve the feudal naming practice, even in cases where upper-ranking bureaucrats received patents of nobility for long service and/or merit, as in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries (see noblesse de robe), the old practice of denoting a noble with a territorial designation was continued out of a sense of tradition. Thus, landless nobles were created under the formula Edler von XYZ: either the surname or a place-name followed the German preposition von, which, in this context, was taken to denote nobility. The English translation of this is normally Noble of XYZ. Frequently, the nobiliary particle von (English 'of', or, more commonly, the French particule de noblesse 'de', meaning the same thing), was represented simply by the abbreviation v. to specify that it was being used to denote a member of the nobility, and not simply as the ordinary German-language preposition von. An example of such a person's name and title is Josef Draginda, Edler v. Draginda. His wife would have been, for example, Johanna Draginda, Edle v. Draginda. Another example is the Austro-Hungarian general Viktor Weber Edler von Webenau, who signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti between Austria-Hungary and the Entente at the end of World War I. The wife and the daughters of an Edler were titled Edle. In Czech this title is translated and used as ≈°lechtic z.Jan ≈ΩUPANIƒå: Nov√° ≈°lechta Rakousk√©ho c√≠sa≈ôstv√≠, Praha Agentura Pankr√°c, 2006 Modern usage in German surnames and alphabetical sorting The title Edler was banned in Austria with the abolition of Austrian nobility in 1919. In Germany, when the German nobility was stripped of its privileges under the Article 109 of Weimar Constitution in 1919, the title was transformed into a dependent part of the legal surname.Article 109 of the Weimar Constitution constitutes: \\"Adelsbezeichnungen gelten nur als Teil des Namens und d√ºrfen nicht mehr verliehen werden.\\" (Noble namings are recognised only as part of the surname and must not be granted any further.) Since that time, the terms Edle, Edler von etc. are not to be translated, as they have lost their title status. These terms now appear following the given name, e.g. Wolfgang Gans Edler Herr zu Putlitz.(1899‚Äì1975, German diplomat, contributing via Jona von Ustinov to the SIS, later East German author and political consultant) As dependent parts of the surnames (nichtselbst√§ndige Namensbestandteile), the terms Edle, Edler von etc. are ignored in alphabetical sorting of names, as is the eventual nobility particle, and might or might not be used by those bearing them. The unofficial titles do, however, retain prestige in some circles of society.

Established in 1865, it is owned and operated by the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS). LPS focuses on preparing students to become WELS pastors and teachers and to continue their education at Martin Luther College (MLC), a WELS college in New Ulm, Minnesota. Curriculum at LPS focuses on the liberal arts and religious studies. LPS has an enrollment of approximately 415 students, with slightly more boys than girls; three-fourths of the student body lives in dormitories on the campus. The campus has a main classroom building, dormitories, a student union/gymnasium, an auditorium, and cafeteria. There are several sports fields, including a track, tennis courts, a football field, a soccer field, and softball and baseball fields. There are 30 full-time faculty members and nine additional piano instructors. Nine tutors live with students in the dormitories. History Luther Preparatory School is the oldest Lutheran high school in the United States. LPS began its history as the prep department of Northwestern College, a pre-ministerial college established in 1865. The prep department received its own identity in 1974 as Northwestern Preparatory School (NPS). In 1995, Northwestern College moved to New Ulm, Minnesota and combined with Dr. Martin Luther College to form Martin Luther College. In the same year, Martin Luther Preparatory School (MLPS) of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin was closed and combined with NPS to form Luther Preparatory School.  Purpose  The mission of Luther Preparatory School is to prepare and encourage young men and women for the full-time ministry in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.  Athletics  Prep's mascot is the Phoenix. LPS plays in the Capitol Conference of WIAA. Fall sports include football and soccer for boys, volleyball and tennis for girls, and cross country for both. In the winter, there is boys' and girls' basketball, as well as men's wrestling. Spring sports are baseball, softball, track and field, boys' tennis, girls' soccer, and golf. Luther Prep also offers intramural sports, such as basketball and volleyball. References * Braun, John A (2000). Together in Christ: A History of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.

It is usually made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family, due to its clarity, tensile strength, dimensional stability, and ability to accept a variety of surface-applied or embedded treatments. Window films are generically categorised by their construction components (dyed, pigmented, metallized, ceramic or nano), by their intended use (automotive, marine or architectural), by substrate type (glass or polycarbonate), and/or by their technical performance (privacy, solar control, safety and security). Window film is normally installed by professional service companies but there are also DIY kits widely available. The International Window Film Association, founded in 1991, provides unbranded information about window films.  Uses  There are many different grades, shades, colours, and thicknesses of available window films built to offer solutions to a variety of challenges. Window films are a retrofit upgrade for existing glass that can be used to address problems inherent to glazing, including: * heat and glare reduction * thermal insulation * UV filtration * safety and security * privacy * decoration, signage and branding * protection from graffiti. *Automotive styling Window films are an extremely cost- effective method to reduce heating and cooling costs in existing buildings by reducing the amount of heat transfer through glazing. Primary properties The colorful film on these windows gives the building a unique appearance while providing privacy and insulation from the sun. Heat rejection films are normally applied to the interior of flat glass windows to reduce the amount of infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation entering windows. Such films are usually dyed or metalized (which can be transparent to visible light) to convert incoming solar radiation to infrared radiation, which is then rejected back through the glass to the exterior. Modern window film technology has created ceramic window films which are non-metallic and do not contain dyes that can result in discoloration. The ceramic and metallic window films usually cost 50-100+ percent more than regular window film but can reduce energy transmission by as much as 80 percent.Your Home: Low-emissivity Window Glazing or Glass. A Consumer's Guide to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. United States Department of Energy Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Ceramic window films cost slightly more but provide a substantial increase by reflecting and absorbing Infrared radiation (radiant heat). To keep the sun's heat out of the house, a low-emissivity coating should be applied to the outside pane of glazed windows. If the windows are designed to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of glazed windows. Such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light. Security films are applied to glass so when the glass is broken it holds together, preventing dangerous shards from flying about, or to make it more difficult for an intruder to gain entry. Typically applied to commercial glass, these films are made of heavy-gauge plastic and are intended to maintain the integrity of glass when subject to heavy impact. The most robust security films are capable of preventing fragmentation and the production of hazardous glass shards from forces such as bomb blasts. Some companies have even experimented with bullet ballistics and multiple layers of security film.\\"Safe Rooms Within Schools.\\" Federal Emergency Management Agency, United States Department of Homeland Security. Another key application for security window films (safety window films) is on large areas of \\"flat glass\\" such as storefront windows, sliding glass doors, and larger windows that are prone to hurricane damage. These security films, if applied properly, can also provide protection for vehicles. These security films are often tinted and can be up to 400 micrometers (¬µm) thick, compared to less than 50 ¬µm for ordinary tint films. If anchored correctly, they can also provide protection for architectural glazing in the event of an explosion. A layer of film (of 100 ¬µm thickness or greater) can prevent the ejection of spall when a projectile impacts on its surface, which otherwise creates small dagger-like shards of glass that can cause injury. Switchable films can be switched from opaque to clear by a safe voltage under 36V AC. In its opaque state, it can be perfectly used as a projection screen that is viewable from both sides. 3G switchable film also has UV (100%) and IR (94%) blocking functions and security function. Graphic design films are generally colored vinyl or frosted. Frosted finish films closely resemble sandblasted or acid-etched glass, while vinyl films are available in a range of colors. Both types of films are commonly used in commercial applications. Privacy films reduce visibility through the glass. Privacy film for flat-glass commercial and residential applications may be silvered, offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side. It may also be frosted, rendering the window translucent but not transparent. Privacy films for automobiles are available in gradients of darkness, with the darker tints commonly known as \\"limo tint.\\" Correctly applied mirror film can create one-way mirrors. Note that in order to be effective the light differential must be from 6 to 10 times greater to maintain the intended performance. For example, the buildings in a city, during the daytime are difficult to see into, at night however, they can be seen in with ease and if a light is on in the interior space it is easily seen along with the contents. Other benefits include protection for passengers in the rear of automobiles, protection from UV rays (which have some harmful effects), cooling for pets, greater privacy, reduced chance of theft (because valuables are less visible), reduced glare and reflection on liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and protection for those who have conditions involving photosensitivity or skin sensitivity, such as lupus (SLE). Window film is also considered more effective and practical than stick-on blinds.  UV filtering to reduce fading  Protection from UV light can be accomplished by film that addresses only the UV spectrum. As UV is one of the main sources of fading, it can prolong the life of fixtures and fittings. Basic colorless clear films reject (absorbs) some UV radiation up to 380 nm, and depending on the manufacturer, UV inhibitors are added to the polyester, with specialist films offering protection to 400 nm. Tinted films are necessary for protection to 500 nm. Window films filter out over 99% of UV rays to 380 nm, reducing the main factor in fading. However, additional factors such as solar heat, visible light, humidity, and presence or absence of chemical vapors also contribute to fading. Therefore, the greatest protection from fading is offered by tinted or metallised window films that reject large levels of heat and visible light, in addition to UV.  Selection of window film  Not all films are suitable for all glass. The absorptance of the glass and the film, the size of the pane, the thickness of the glass, the construction of the window should be considered in terms of single pane, insulated glass, treated (with a low- emissivity coating), laminated or toughened. Advice on the appropriate selection of film for the glass is vital to ensure that the glass does not crack as a result of thermal stress. However, it is possible that a pane of glass may break subsequent to the application of an appropriate film, because the pane has been damaged during the glazing of the window, or as a result of movement of the building or other physical stresses that are not apparent at the time of the application of the film. Glass may crack subsequent to the application of sign writing or if heavy, thermally efficient drapes are hung close to the glass, particularly if the edges of the glass are damaged. The chances of glass breakage occurring subsequent to the application of film or sign writing or the hanging of drapes, are very small. However breakage can occur and it is impossible to predict the edge condition of the glass without removing it from the frame ‚Äì an approach that is not practical. Thermal properties Heating and cooling systems have energy costs, and window films can be used to increase building insulation. Modern windows with low-solar- gain glass do not need retrofit films, but since most of the existing windows do not have a low solar heat gain, window films make a lot of sense as a retrofit energy improvement.\\" Energy efficient window treatments \\"; Energy.gov They can provide thermal comfort and are one of the most cost-competitive and environmentally-friendly energy improvements, especially in hot and mixed climates.  Unintended features  Under certain conditions, window film will exhibit iridescence also known as thin film Interference (TFI) and is well known in the aviation industry. TFI essentially refers to colours gradually changing as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. This phenomenon usually occurs at night, when the source of illumination within a building is fluorescent lighting. The amount of iridescence may vary from almost imperceptible to very visible. It most frequently occurs when the film is constructed with scratch resistance protection. When iridescence does occur in window film, the best way to stop it is to prevent the fluorescent light from illuminating the film or to use an alternative type of light. Building use Window tints can be used in applications like shopfront windows, office block windows, and house windows. This is often done to increase privacy, and decrease heating and cooling costs. Window tints are used in some energy efficient buildings. Window films are also used to apply see-through graphics to glass and other transparent surfaces, to provide advertising, branding, signage and decoration. See-through graphics are most commonly applied using a perforated window film with a graphic visible from one side but not the other side, which remains see-though. Vehicle wraps on buses are perhaps the widest application of see-through graphics.  Certification and standards  The thicker window films known as safety and security window film are designed to perform under extreme conditions, and as such there are specific standard criteria these films should meet, such as American standards ANSI Z.97, CPSC 16 CFR 1201, Cat II (400 ft-lb), and the British Standards BS 6206 (Class A, B, C). The European Committee for Standardization offer the EN12600 standard Classification of Resistance of Glazing to Impact. Often, building codes dictate that a film must have a report verifying that it has met at least one of these standards. Solar window film is usually subject to less critical testing. However, standards are in place to maintain a level of quality in the industry. The ANSI Standards ASTM E903 and ASTM D1044-93 relate to the solar/UV transmission properties and abrasion resistance, respectively. The larger window film manufacturers use these standards to guarantee the quality of their raw materials and finished products.  Regulations for automotive use  convertible in America. Tint on the front window is lighter than on the back window because of window tint laws. 230px Automobile window tinting reduces the \\"Visible Light Transmission\\" (VLT) through car windows. This can be problematic at night, or when motorists must be able to see through the windows of other vehicles in order to spot hazards. Police also may want to be able to identify the passengers or any potential threat inside a vehicle. Therefore, in many jurisdictions, there are laws to restrict the darkness of tinting.  Factory tint  \\"Factory tint\\", done at the time of manufacture is generally not an applied film, but instead is done by dyeing the inside of the glass with a darkened pigment during glass manufacturing, an electrical process known as \\"deep dipping.\\" The pigment gives the glass a tint, but doesn't provide UV ray protection or heat rejection like most window films do.

Biography Rademacher received his Ph.D. in 1916 from Georg-August- Universit√§t G√∂ttingen; Constantin Carath√©odory supervised his dissertation.. He was dismissed from his position at the University of Breslau by the Nazis in 1933 due to his public support of the Weimar Republic,. and emigrated from Europe in 1934. After leaving Germany, he moved to Philadelphia and worked at the University of Pennsylvania until his retirement in 1962; he held the Thomas A. Scott Professorship of Mathematics at Pennsylvania from 1956 to 1962. Rademacher had a number of well-known students, including George Andrews, Paul T. Bateman, Theodor Estermann and Emil Grosswald. Research Rademacher performed research in analytic number theory, mathematical genetics, the theory of functions of a real variable, and quantum theory. Most notably, he developed the theory of Dedekind sums. In 1937 Rademacher discovered an exact convergent series for the partition function P(n), the number of integer partitions of a number, improving upon Ramanujan's asymptotic non-convergent series and validating Ramanujan's supposition that an exact series representation existed. Awards and honors With his retirement from the University of Pennsylvania, a group of mathematicians provided the seed funding for The Hans A. Rademacher Instructorships, and honored him with an honorary degree as Doctor of Science.  Works  * with Otto Toeplitz: Von Zahlen und Figuren. 1930. 2nd edn. 1933.

National Museum A Hills Hoist is a height-adjustable rotary clothes line, designed to permit the compact hanging of wet clothes so that their maximum area can be exposed for wind drying by rotation. The Hills Hoist has been manufactured in Adelaide, South Australia by Lance Hill since 1945. The Hills Hoist and similar rotary clothes hoists remain a common fixture in many backyards in Australia and New Zealand. They are considered one of Australia's most recognisable icons, and are used frequently by artists as a metaphor for Australian suburbia in the 1950s and 1960s.George Negus on ABC Transcript from 17/2/03 The opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics featured a sequence with giant Hills Hoist robots roaming around the arena. Although originally a product name, the term \\"Hills Hoist\\" became synonymous with rotary clothes hoists and clothes line in general, throughout Australia. As early as 1895 Colin Stewart and Allan Harley of Sun Foundry in Adelaide applied for a patent for an 'Improved Rotary and Tilting Clothes Drying Rack'. In their design the upper clothes line frame tilted to allow access to the hanging lines.Rotary and Tilting Clothes Drying Rack National Archives of Australia: Accessed 3/6/2011 Gilbert Toyne of Geelong patented, manufactured and marketed four rotary clothes hoists designs between 1911 and 1946.

Holmes is the youngest Canadian to ever win the Victoria Cross. Early life Although Holmes was born in Montreal, Quebec, his family was from Owen Sound, Ontario. His father's work had taken them to Montreal; however, they returned to Owen Sound when Tommy was about six years old. During his last year of school, he worked for the butcher J.R. Boyd, and just before enlisting Holmes was working on the farm of Templeton Day at nearby Annan, Ontario. World War I On 20 December 1915, No. 838301 Tommy Holmes enlisted as a private soldier in the 147th (Grey) Battalion, CEF, at Owen Sound in Grey County. The 147th Battalion was raised by the Grey Regiment, which also later raised the 248th Battalion, CEF. As was common practice at the time, Tommy lied about his age - he was actually 17 years old when he joined-up. He was sworn-in by the 147th Grey Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel G.H. McFarland. Prior to embarking for England, the battalion trained at Camps Niagara and Borden (today CFB Borden) in Ontario, and at Amherst, Nova Scotia. The battalion was at Camp Borden from 4 July 1916 until 5 October 1916, when it departed for Halifax. Embarkation was delayed, leading to the 147th encamping at Amherst. Finally, on 20 November 1916, Tommy Holmes arrived with the 147th (Grey) Battalion at Liverpool, England. The 147th had sailed in RMS Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic. Like the other 35 CEF battalions that trained at the newly opened Camp Borden in that hot summer of 1916, the 147th (Grey) Battalion was broken-up for reinforcements to units already in the field. Consequently, Tommy Holmes was transferred to the 8th Reserve (Holding) Battalion on 1 February 1917, and then to the 4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles on 16 February 1917. In April 1917 during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, he received a through-and-through bullet wound from a machinegun in his arm and was temporarily invalided to England. While in hospital, he met up with his older brother Roy, who had enlisted earlier in the 58th Battalion, CEF and who had also been wounded, losing an eye. Holmes was 19 years old, when as a private serving with the 4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles, Canadian Expeditionary Force, he won the Victoria Cross. On 26 October 1917 near Passchendaele, Belgium, he performed a deed for which King George V awarded Tommy the Victoria Cross: \\"when the right flank of the Canadian attack was held up by heavy machine-gun fire from a pill-box strong point and heavy casualties were producing a critical situation, Private Holmes, on his own initiative and single-handed, ran forward and threw two bombs, killing and wounding the crews of two machine-guns. He then fetched another bomb and threw this into the entrance of the pill-box, causing the 19 occupants to surrender.\\" It was during the investiture at Buckingham Palace that Holmes admitted to King George V that he had lied about his age and joined the army at age 17. Sergeant Tommy Holmes, VC, returned to Owen Sound after the war to great fanfare and receiving a hero's welcome. On 16 September 1919, he was chosen to be part of the Colour Party for the laying-up of the 147th (Grey) Battalion, CEF Colours in the Carnegie Library, Owen Sound. Later life After the war Holmes was a pilot for the Harbour Commission for fifteen years. In 1936 he and another officer saved the lives of three persons whose auxiliary cabin boat upset in the harbour. In 1935 his home was robbed and the Victoria Cross was stolen. In 1942 Holmes narrowly escaped death when his launch exploded. Holmes died of cancer on 4 January 1950 and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Owen Sound, Ontario, on 7 January 1950 with full military honours. His memorial service was attended by Victoria Cross winners Henry Howey Robson, Colin Fraser Barron and Walter Leigh Rayfield. Annually on Remembrance Day, a firing party from The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, which perpetuates the 147th (Grey) Battalion, CEF, fires a volley over his grave. Of significance is that two other VC winners are also buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Air Marshal Billy Bishop and Major David Vivian Currie. A replica of Thomas Holmes VC medal is now on display at the Owen Sound Royal Canadian Legion Branch #6. In the 1986, the Owen Sound Armoury, being the Grey County home of The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, was renamed the \\"Tommy Holmes, VC, Memorial Armoury.\\" thumb References Further reading  *Monuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999) *The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997) *VCs of the First World War - Passchendaele 1917 (Stephen Snelling, 1998) * The Globe and Mail, January 5, 1950 * Croft, Melba Morris. \\"The Story of Tommy Holmes, V.C. 1898-1950.\\" Owen Sound: The Grey and Simcoe Foresters/Stan Brown Printers, 1983, 1986. * Fisher, Major J.R. and Captain E.J.

The Red River Valley Research Corridor is the name that has been given to a region in the American state of North Dakota. It roughly comprises the corridor along the Red River of the North. The Research Corridor is anchored by North Dakota State University (NDSU) and the University of North Dakota (UND). The corridor was established in 2002 by United States Senator Byron Dorgan in an effort to draw research dollars to the state. Since that year, Dorgan has helped to direct $300 million to research in the corridor. Research at NDSU Areas of research at North Dakota State University include nanoscale science and engineering, microsensors (RFID tags), polymers and coatings, agriculture, combinatorial science, and spintronics. Research at NDSU includes the annual $100+ million NDSU research budget, $78.4 million in annual outlays, $234.9 million in annual direct and secondary impacts, as well as research budgets from other enterprises that are a part of the research park. Many of the research projects at NDSU use federally backed grants, including several from the United States Department of Defense. The NDSU Research and Technology Park is a 55-acre (223,000 m¬≤) site of innovation and technology; the site sits adjacent to the main NDSU campus. The Research and Technology Park is a public/private partnership between NDSU and private enterprises. As of 2006, the research park employed 511. The park's cornerstone anchor tenant is Phoenix International, a Deere & Company (John Deere) company. Phoenix International develops custom, integrated electronic systems. Other research park facilities include Research 1 (polymers and coatings), Research 2 (nanotechnology), Alien Technology (microsensors, RFID), the Center for High Performance Computing, the Center for Technology Enterprise, and an NDSU controlled Candlewood Suites hotel. Research at UND Clifford Hall at UND Areas of research at the University of North Dakota include biosciences and medicine, energy and the environment, aerospace sciences and engineering, and human health and nutrition. The UND Technology Park is a 55-acre (223,000 m¬≤) research and technology campus on the west end of the UND campus. Facilities at the research park include two business and technology incubators ‚Äî the Skalicky Technology Incubator and the Ina Mae Rude Entrepreneur Center. Other buildings in the research park include COELSAT (Center of Excellence in Life Sciences and Technology), Ryan Hall, UND Aerospace Foundation office building, the National Weather Service, BioLife Plasma Services, and a Hilton Garden Inn. In addition to the UND Technology Park, other research institutions at UND include the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) which includes the National Center for Hydrogen Technology, the UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and the United States Department of Agriculture Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center. From now until at least 2010, UND will play host to NASA's Douglas DC-8 \\"Flying Laboratory\\" research aircraft. The University's agreement with NASA is valued at $25 million. The aircraft's areas of research include tracking pollution, monitoring the hole in the ozone layer, and studying the atmosphere's chemistry. One feature of the research park is the Center for Technology Enterprise. The Center is a . building that serves the needs of entrepreneurial endeavors. The center offers venture capital, networking and technical advice, as well as supply services, among others. The building offers wet and dry labs, tenant space, production/manufacturing areas, as well as internet/computer capabilities suitable for expansive research and development. One of the building's major tenants is the Bobcat Company. Economic impact Research at both NDSU and UND has an economic impact on the state of North Dakota. A 2007 study showed that research at UND had a statewide economic impact of $135.7 million. The same study showed that UND research generated a total of 1,649 jobs, of which 728 were on campus. Another 2007 study showed that research at NDSU had a statewide economic impact of $100 million. That study showed that NDSU research generated a total of 1,250 jobs, of which 950 were on campus.

She was recommissioned in 1940 and wrecked in a storm in October 1945. History Greene was named for Samuel Greene and launched 2 November 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. John Stevens Conover, the namesake's daughter; and commissioned 9 May 1919, Commander R. A. Theobald in command. Destroyer (1919-1922) Greene sailed from Newport, Rhode Island 5 June 1919 for Brest via Plymouth, England, and returned to New York 27 July. Underway again 18 August, she put in at San Diego, California, 22 December and decommissioned there in March 1920. Remaining in the Reserve Destroyer Force until 10 September 1921, she sailed from San Diego that date for the Puget Sound Navy Yard. Greene returned shortly thereafter to San Francisco, California, arriving 2 December 1921, and decommissioned there 17 June 1922. Seaplane tender (1940-1944) Recommissioned 28 June 1940 at San Diego, Greene was towed to San Francisco and was redesignated AVD-13 6 April 1941 following conversion. She sailed 27 April for the Caribbean and conducted training and tended seaplanes off Puerto Rico and Bermuda. One week after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Greene sailed for Brazil. Until the summer of 1942 she served as seaplane tender at Natal with one call at Rio de Janeiro for repairs in February 1942. She returned to Charleston, South Carolina 18 July 1942. She escorted a convoy from Norfolk, Virginia to Bermuda and operated in the South Atlantic for the next 6 months as a convoy escort, making two voyages to Rio de Janeiro. Back at Norfolk 26 February 1943, she steamed from there to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, to operate with , one of the new escort carriers designed to hunt German submarines in the North Atlantic. Both warships sailed 23 April to escort a convoy to Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland, and made the eastward passage without incident. On the return leg of the voyage, however, one of the first major engagements between carrier-based aircraft and submarines attempting a rendezvous for mass attack occurred 21 May ‚Äì 22 May, when Bogues planes made six attacks on submarines and sank in 50-40 N., 35-21 W. Twenty- four Germans were captured. During a second antisubmarine patrol from 31 May to 20 June 1943, Bogue and her escorts, including Greene, sank further submarines: 5 June in 30-18 N., 42-50 W., and in 30-49 N., 33-49 W. one week later. For these two successful antisubmarine operations Greene received the Presidential Unit Citation. The Bogue group was the first of a series of offensive antisubmarine warfare patrols in response to the U-Boat assault in the Atlantic. Subsequently, until the fall of 1943, Greene escorted a fast troop convoy from Norfolk to the United Kingdom and return, and operated off Bermuda. On 5 October she sailed as carrier escort for in company with and . On 20 October the group sank in 47-40 N., 28-27 W. High-speed transport (1944-1945) Greene in January 1945. Greene returned to Charleston 19 January 1944 for conversion to high speed transport, and was designated APD-36 on 1 February 1944. After intensive training, she stood out 12 April for Oran, Algeria, to take part in Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France. On 14 August, when she left the staging area at Propriano, Corsica, and landed American and Canadian troops on the Levant and Port Cros Islands off the coast of France between Toulon and Cannes. Greenes troops were assigned to the mission of seizing the strategic islands and silencing long range coastal batteries thought to be emplaced there. That day, the islands were secured - many of the German \\"guns\\" turned out to be stove pipes - and the stage was set for 15 August assault on the mainland. With her tasks accomplished, Greene served on escort duty in the Mediterranean until departing Oran 6 December 1944 for Norfolk, where she put in 21 December. Underway once more 29 January 1945, the warship steamed via Panama to reach Ulithi 31 March and commenced escort duties. During April she escorted four carriers to Okinawa while the battle for that island was underway. She returned to Guam to meet another Okinawan convoy, and stood antisubmarine picket line duty off Okinawa. Until the fall of 1945, Greene continued escort duties between Okinawa, Saipan, and the Philippines. After the war's end, she evacuated ex-prisoners of war from Nagasaki after that port had been razed by the second atomic bomb dropped on Japan, and moored at Okinawa 24 September. Fate Greenes long career came to an end during Typhoon Louise on 9 October 1945 at Okinawa. Winds in excess of 100 knots drove her aground on the northwest coast of Kudaka, damaging her beyond economic repair. All useful material from the ship was salvaged. She decommissioned 23 November 1945. Greene was struck from the Navy List 5 December 1945. Her wreck was destroyed with explosives on 11 February 1946.

He was a prolific composer of band music, his best-known composition being \\"The Whistler and His Dog\\". In later life, he became a Democratic Party politician from New Jersey, who served on the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders during the 1930s. Early life and education He was born on September 22, 1869 on the second floor of the Lyceum Theater in Saint Joseph, Missouri.While 1870 has been traditionally noted, Arthur is listed as a few months old in the January, 1870 Federal census taken in St. Joseph, Missouri, so was clearly born in 1869. He was the son of Samuel Pryor, bandmaster and founder of the original Pryor band, and his wife. Arthur first took up music at a very young age under the tutelage of his father and was playing the valve trombone by age 11. The story goes that whenever he hit a sour note while practicing, his father planted a resounding crack on his head with a violin bow. The boy developed until he was so skilled that he won a place in the John Philip Sousa's band. He was hailed as a prodigy after this. Musical career Pryor went on to direct the Stanley Opera Company in Denver, Colorado until joining the John Philip Sousa Band in 1892. He played his first solo with the Sousa Band at age 22 during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. During his 12 years with the Sousa Band, Pryor estimated that he played 10,000 solos. From 1895 to 1903, Pryor was assistant conductor of the Sousa Band. During his association with the \\"March King\\", Pryor toured throughout the USA and Europe. While in Europe, he entertained King Edward VII of England and Czar Nicholas II of Russia with his trombone solos. Once while in Germany, all the trombonists of the German Army bands were ordered to hear him play. They were so amazed at his playing that they insisted on taking his trombone apart, refusing to believe that it was natural. Finally one German said: \\"No one can play so well. It is a Yankee trick.\\" In 1902 after the death of his father, Pryor ended his association with Sousa and took over the reorganized Pryor band; he led its debut at the Majestic Theatre in New York City on November 15, 1903. For 30 years thereafter, Pryor's band was an American institution. He made his first appearance in Asbury Park, New Jersey at the Shore in 1904, where he continued to play until 1930. The Pryor Band toured until 1909, when he decided to settle down and make Asbury Park the home of the band. Also at this time, he became a staff conductor and arranger for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey. He organized a second band that played at the entertainment complex of Coney Island, New York, for a number of years. Post-conducting career and death Pryor retired from full-time conducting in 1933. On November 7 of that year, he and Henry W. Herbert were elected to the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders, defeating Director Bryant B. Newcomb and his running mate, Arthur Johnson.The Matawan Journal, Nov. 10, 1933 Pryor and Herbert would each serve one, three-year term in office. In the 1936 election, they were defeated by Republicans J. Russell Woolley and Edgar O. Murphy.Red Bank Register, Nov. 5, 1936 Pryor was married to Maude Russell Pryor.

The senior Pryor suffered a stroke on June 17, 1942, and died on June 18 at his home in West Long Branch, New Jersey. Funeral services were conducted June 21, 1942, at the Trinity Episcopal Church, Asbury Park, followed by burial in Glenwood Cemetery, West Long Branch. Legacy Pryor composed some 300 works, including marches, novelties, tone poems and three light operas, Jinga Boo, Uncle Tom's Cabin and On the Eve of Her Wedding Day. Among his best-known numbers were \\"On Jersey Shore\\", \\"Queen Titania\\" and \\"The Whistler and His Dog\\". He set to work on an opera titled Peter and Paul, with a libretto by L. Frank Baum; the libretto has been lost. It was intended to star Fred Stone and David Montgomery in several roles in several time periods. During his career, Pryor wrote some of today's most well-known trombone literature, including an arrangement of the heralded \\"Bluebells of Scotland\\", as well as band novelty works such as \\"The Whistler and His Dog\\", with its piccolo solo, his best-known composition.\\"Arthur Pryor, Bandsman, Dies\\" (June 18, 1942) Emporia Daily Gazette, Emporia, Kansas Much of this literature has been recorded by Ian Bousfield on his CD Pryor Engagement (Doyen DOY CD212).

(stylized as CineMark) is an American movie theater chain that started operations in 1984 as Cinemark USA, Inc. and since then it operates theaters with hundreds of throughout the Americas and in Taiwan. It is headquartered in Plano, Texas, in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth area. It is the largest movie theatre chain in Brazil, with a 30 percent market share. Cinemark operates theaters under several brands, including its flagship Cinemark, Century Theatres, Tinseltown, Cin√©Arts and Rave Cinemas.Cinemark.com , Cin√©Arts History Cinemark Theatres in Rockwall, Texas. Cinemark was started by Lee Roy Mitchell as a chain of theatres in California, Texas and Utah. It is unclear when Cinemark was first founded. While Cinemark officially claims to have launched in 1984 (and previously claimed a 1983 founding date), online records show Cinemark might have started as early as 1977. The roots of the company date back to the 1960s when brothers J.C. and Lee Roy Mitchell created Mitchell Theatres, Inc.\\"Interstate Purchases New Drive-In Theatre.\\" Waco News Tribune, February 9, 1966, p. 5. By 1972, the company was named Texas Cinema Corporation. Lee Roy Mitchell then formed a group of theaters under the Cinemark name beginning in 1977. Cinemark Corporation and Texas Cinema Corporation merged operations in June 1979 creating a portfolio of 25 theaters in Texas and New Mexico under the Cinemark brand.\\"Realty Insight.\\" Dallas Morning News, June 17, 1979, p. 4B. With the opening of the Movies 8 on 3912 Hampton Road in Texarkana, Texas in 1987, Cinemark began building theaters with colorful interiors and large video game arcades. The following year, Cinemark introduced its Front Row Joe mascot. This animated cat appeared in policy trailers and on kids' concession products. The mascot was retired in 1998 when Cinemark had begun to open Art Deco-style theatres, and was revived in 2002. In 1992, Cinemark opened a new theater concept called Hollywood USA in Garland, Texas; this concept was subsequently refined into the Tinseltown USA brand of theaters, which were much bigger than what Cinemark had previously built. The following year, Cinemark expanded to Latin America with the opening of a theater in Santiago, Chile. The next year, Cinemark opened four theaters in Mexico. In 1998, Cinemark announced that it would replace its bright color interiors with what Cinemark characterized as a more classic Art Deco design. Through new theatre construction and acquisitions, it became the third largest theatre chain in the United States and the second largest theatre chain in the world. Mitchell's son Kevin Mitchell worked with the company as an executive until leaving in 2007 to found ShowBiz Cinemas. In 2013, Cinemark decided to sell all of its Mexican theaters to Cinemex. United States Department of Justice lawsuits In the 1990s, Cinemark Theatres was one of the first chains to incorporate stadium-style seating into their theatres. Cinemark Brings Stadium Seating to the Valley . Cinemark press release, August 13, 1998. Accessed 3 June 2009. In 1997, several disabled individuals filed a lawsuit against Cinemark, alleging that their stadium style seats forced patrons who used wheelchairs to sit in the front row of the theatre, effectively rendering them unable to see the screen without assuming a horizontal position. The case was heard in El Paso district court as Lara v. Cinemark USA, where a judge ruled that the architecture of Cinemark's theatres violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ruling was later overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Cinemark only had to provide an \\"unobstructed view\\" of the screen, and that since disabled patrons' view was only awkward and not actually obscured, Cinemark was not violating the law.\\"Appellate Court OKs Stadium-style Movie Seating; Cinemark, USA Inc. Wins ADA Case\\". Business Wire, April 11, 2000. Accessed 3 June 2009. In response, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed their own suit against Cinemark while appealing the appellate court's decision. The DOJ argued that, while Cinemark was not technically violating the ADA, it was nevertheless discriminating against disabled patrons by relegating them to the worst seats in the auditorium. Cinemark responded by filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging misconduct on the DOJ's behalf. Cinemark's lawsuit was thrown out, and the Department of Justice proceeded with its lawsuit. Cinemark ultimately agreed to settle out of court before the court came to a ruling, agreeing with the DOJ that it was in the company's best interest to end litigation before a ruling was issued. Per the terms of the settlement, Cinemark agreed to renovate all existing theatres to provide patrons who used wheelchairs access to rows higher in its theatres, and also agreed that all future theatres would be constructed so as to allow handicapped patrons better access to higher rows. In turn, the Department of Justice agreed not to bring further litigation against the company in relation to the architecture of stadium seating as it applies to the ADA. Aurora shooting On July 20, 2012, a gunman opened fire during the midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in a Century theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. The gunman, later identified as James Eagan Holmes, who was believed to be acting alone, entered the theater dressed in protective clothing, set off tactical grenades, then opened fire with multiple firearms on the theatergoers. Counting both fatalities and injuries, the attack was the largest mass shooting in terms of number of casualties in United States history at the time. The theater was reopened on January 17, 2013. The theater was sued by families of the victims, who alleged the theater should have taken greater measures to prevent the such a shooting. In May 2016, after years of legal debate, a jury took three hours to deliver a unanimous verdict that the theater chain was not liable to any degree for the tragedy that transpired. As the prevailing party in the judgement, Cinemark sought nearly US$700,000 from the plaintiffs to recover litigation expenses. In September 2016, after objections from the victims, Cinemark dropped all claims for reimbursement of legal fees. A separate group of victims were also dismissed in federal court when US District Judge R. Brooke Jackson ruled: \\"[James Holmes'] own premeditated and intentional actions were the predominant cause of the plaintiffs' losses.\\" In the wake of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Cinemark announced that it would no longer allow bags larger than in its theaters as a safety precaution. 2020 temporary closure Effective March 18, 2020, Cinemark closed all of its 345 theaters across the United States indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cinemark released a statement describing the temporary closure \\"as a proactive measure in support of the health and safety of its employees, guests and communities.\\" As of July 18, 2020, there are 5 locations currently open, one at Universal Studios and the other 4 are open in Texas, two in Plano, one in Dallas, and finally one in McKinney, most Cinemark locations were planned to open at the end of July. In light of the pandemic, a few dozen locations have upgraded their box office stands, replacing them with digital kiosks for ticket purchases, including the lay offs of many ushers working up front-end. Political causes In 2008, CEO Alan Stock donated US$9,999 toward the successful passage of California's Proposition 8, an initiative restricting the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples and overturning the California Supreme Court's ruling that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. An ensuing campaign, launched by opponents to the Prop 8 passage, encouraged patrons to see the Gus Van Sant film Milk, starring Sean Penn in the title role of gay-rights activist Harvey Milk, at a competing theater in protest.Cieply, Michael. \\"Activists Seek to Tie ‚ÄòMilk‚Äô to a Campaign for Gay Rights\\".

Politico, September 9, 2018. Theater chains acquired=Century Theatres acquisition On August 8, 2006, Cinemark purchased Century Theatres with a combination of cash and stock bonds. This acquisition added over 80 theatres and many more screens. Some of these theatres were subsequently shut down either being phased out as under performing or replaced with new complexes. The transaction was completed on October 5, 2006. With this purchase, Cinemark heavily strengthened their presence in Northern California and entered Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, and Washington state, though at the transaction both of their locations in Washington state were still under construction. However, Cinemark retains the Century banner and continues to open new locations under that banner. Muvico Theaters purchases In 2009, in order to save the company from a potential bankruptcy, Muvico Theaters sold four theatres to Cinemark: Arundel Mills Egyptian 24 in Hanover, Maryland; Paradise 24 in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Palace 20 in Boca Raton, Florida; and Boynton Beach 14 in Boynton Beach, Florida. Rave Cinemas purchase In November 2012 Cinemark announced it was acquiring Rave Cinemas, the Dallas, Texas‚Äìbased chain that operates the former Bridge theater with IMAX in Culver City, California for US$240 million. The deal included 32 theaters located in 12 US states, representing 483 screens. Tim Warner, Cinemark's CEO said in a statement \\"The acquisition of these high quality assets will further enhance Cinemark's diversified domestic footprint, including the expansion of our presence in the New England market\\". The sale was closed on May 29, 2013, but Cinemark was required to sell the Rave Stonybrook 20 + IMAX theater in Louisville, Kentucky, the Rave Ritz Center 16 in southern New Jersey, and either the Rave Hickory Creek 16 in Hickory Creek, Texas or the Cinemark 14 in Denton, Texas. In addition, Cinemark's chairman Lee Roy Mitchell was also required to sell the Movie Tavern Inc. to Southern Theatres. On July 18, 2013, Cinemark found a buyer, Carmike Cinemas, for the Stonybrook 20 & IMAX, Rave Ritz Center 16, and the Rave Hickory Creek 16. With this change, National CineMedia has been replaced with Screenvision at the Stonybrook 20 and Ritz Center 16. Screenvision is already at Hickory Creek, Texas at the time of the announcement of the sale. The sale was closed on August 16, 2013. On September 12, 2013, Southern Theatres announced that they acquired The Movie Tavern from Lee Roy Mitchell after he was required to sell The Movie Tavern after Cinemark bought Rave Cinemas on May 29, 2013. In 2018, Southern sold the Movie Tavern chain to the Marcus Corporation. As part of Southern Theatres' long-term deal with National CineMedia, The Movie Tavern switched from Screenvision to National CineMedia in June 2014. Also, Cinemark purchased Rave Cinemas Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 15, in Los Angeles, in June 2014.

Her body was discovered 33 days after her disappearance, on Easter Sunday, near the Trimble family home. She had been sexually assaulted. The case went unsolved for 33 years. During the early years of their inquiry into the assault and murder, the police persisted in investigating one particular suspect, finally charging him in 1979, but he was released in 1980 for lack of evidence. In 2008, Jerome Sydney Barrett - not the person they had pursued in the 1970s - was charged with the assault and murder of Marcia Trimble, after DNA evidence recovered from her remains linked him to the crime. Barrett had been arrested just days after Trimble's disappearance, on suspicion of the sexual assault of a local university student, and was still in jail when Trimble's sexually assaulted body was found. Despite this and his convictions for attacks on other women and children, police had not investigated him in relation to Trimble's murder. On July 18, 2009, a jury convicted him for Trimble's sexual assault and murder, and he was sentenced to 44 years in prison. Trimble's murder occurred soon after two other crimes: * On February 2, 1975, Sarah Des Prez, a Vanderbilt University student, was murdered near the university, which is located close to Green Hills, where Marcia was murdered. Barrett was linked to this crime at the same time that his DNA was linked to Trimble's murder. * On February 17, 1975, a Belmont University student was raped in Nashville. Jerome Barrett was arrested in March, 1975, in connection with this crime. He was convicted of it a year later. Early murder investigation Marcia Trimble disappeared while delivering Girl Scout Cookies in her neighborhood. The case was investigated by local and state police. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) joined the case due to the possibility of kidnapping. Trimble's body was discovered more than a month later. It was found that she had been sexually assaulted before being killed. Investigators searched the neighborhood, believing it likely that the murderer was a local resident. Police attention soon focused on Jeffrey Womack, a 15-year-old boy who lived near Marcia's home. Womack was one of the last people to see her alive. Marcia had come to Womack's house the day of her disappearance. Womack said that he had sent her away because he did not have money to buy cookies. He said that, after he learned of the girl's disappearance, he went to her house to tell the police there what he knew. According to Womack, the police aggressively questioned him and then made him empty out his pockets. Inside the pockets, police found a half roll of pennies, a five-dollar bill, and a condom. This seemed to contradict Womack's testimony that he lacked the money to pay Marcia. The condom suggested to police that he may have sexually abused Marcia. Womack later said that he had the condom because he was having a sexual relationship with a local woman. According to Womack, his mother and a neighbor found out that the police were questioning him and insisted that any further interrogation must be done with a lawyer present. Reporter Demetria Kalodimos believed that Womack's decision to call a lawyer made police more suspicious of him. They felt that an innocent person had no need of a lawyer. Womack's attorney, John Hollins, advised him to stop cooperating with police. After that, Womack refused to discuss the case with either the police or the media. Unable to obtain a confession, the police resorted to other means to try and gather evidence against Womack. When Womack was 17 years old and working as a bus boy in a restaurant, the police sent an undercover officer into the restaurant to befriend him, but they did not get any incriminating evidence. Womack passed two polygraph tests. In 1980, authorities finally arrested him for Marcia Trimble's murder, but the charge was dismissed for lack of evidence. Many police officers involved in the case continued to believe that he was guilty. DNA samples were taken from semen collected from Marcia's body, but these samples were stored improperly and deteriorated over time, limiting investigators' ability to identify or exclude suspects. Police collected DNA samples from 96 suspects, including Womack, but none of these samples matched the DNA found in the semen. Evidence found Investigators said they believed more than one man's semen was found inside Marcia's body. Semen also was found on her clothes. Investigators believed Marcia had been lured into a garage and killed there. Her body was found fully clothed next to bags of fertilizer in the garage. Despite having been lying there for a month, there was little decomposition, due to the cool, dry environment. The cause of death was determined to be strangulation because Marcia had suffered a broken hyoid bone. Police found it difficult to determine how many people were involved in the crime. They believed the perpetrator was a juvenile and someone Marcia knew. Dirt that was found on her shoe was mainly upon the sole, indicating that she had walked into the garage, and had not been dragged into it. Semen was found on the girl's blouse and pants but not on her underwear. Semen was also found in her vagina, but there was no other sign of rape or penetration. Investigators believed Marcia's attacker was either an adolescent boy or a man with a very small penis. DNA tests seemed to indicate there was semen from as many as four different attackers. One investigator doubted this because the samples had been poorly preserved. \\"I'm not confident in the DNA sample that we've got,\\" Nashville homicide detective Tommy Jacobs said.Matt Pulle, \\"The File on Marcia Trimble Part II,\\" Nashville Scene, 2001-06-28 Theories pursued by investigators In 2001, a local paper interviewed Police Captain Mickey Miller, former homicide detective Tommy Jacobs of the Nashville Police, and former FBI agent Richard Knudsen about the unsolved Trimble case. Each had a different theory about what had happened on the evening when Trimble disappeared. Captain Miller said that while Trimble was killed in the garage where she was found, that may not have been where she was sexually assaulted. Miller thought that Trimble might have been sexually assaulted at a tree nursery which became part of the investigation. Citing DNA evidence, he also believed that she was sexually assaulted by up to three boys.Pulle, Matt. \\"The File on Marcia Trimble\\",Part I , The Nashville Scene and \\"The File on Marcia Trimble, Part II\\" , The Nashville Scene, June 21 and 28, 2001 Jacobs was not sure that Marcia left her home to deliver cookies to Marie Maxwell. He suggested she might have been planning to meet up with Womack. Jacobs said he thought that someone Marcia knew lured her into the garage. He did not know if it was Womack or just an \\"adolescent teenager with his hormones blitzing.\\" \\"The suspect just raped someone. It was probably a new experience for him, and it was a new experience for Marcia. It was a tense situation. Marcia screamed. I don't think the perpetrator wanted to kill her. I think he wanted to gain control of her and make her be quiet.\\" In contrast to Miller (his former boss), Jacobs did not believe that Marcia was sexually assaulted by more than one person. The FBI's Knudsen posed a different theory. He said that Marcia had walked to Marie Maxwell's home as the woman was pulling into her driveway. Given the timing, Marcia could not have known that Maxwell was returning home unless someone had called to tell her. Just minutes earlier, Maxwell had parked her car in front of a neighbor's driveway to ask a quick question. That house was across the street from the Womack and Morgan homes. If Jeffrey Womack was home during that time, or if he was at Peggy Morgan's house, he could have seen Maxwell's car and called to Marcia. Knudsen placed Womack at the driveway with Marcia. The three investigators' theories varied widely, but they concluded that whoever killed Marcia most likely was a juvenile who lived in the neighborhood. Indictment of Jerome Barrett On June 6, 2008, a Davidson County Grand Jury indicted 60-year-old Jerome Sydney Barrett, charging him with first-degree murder and felony in the case of Marcia Trimble. Barrett had formerly been indicted and convicted for other assaults against women and children. At the time of Marcia's murder, Barrett was working in her neighborhood.E. Thomas Wood and Ken Whitehouse, Barrett first took responsibility for the 1975 murder during a private conversation on the rooftop of the Davidson County Criminal Justice Center. During questioning, \\"He said he did not rape her. He killed her.\\" \\"He said his DNA was on her, but not in her.\\" Barrett once again claimed to have killed Marcia immediately after he had had an altercation with another jail inmate. It was during this altercation, the convict said, that Barrett claimed to have killed \\"four blue- eyed bitches.\\" Journalists revealed that, for more than a decade, investigators had concealed the fact that DNA evidence excluded numerous neighbors as potential suspects. A retired police detective admitted that the men were excluded and that they had not been told of the fact. In the early years of the investigation, the use of DNA evidence was new, and investigators did not thoroughly understand its implications. Investigators were not sure the DNA evidence was conclusive for excluding suspects. In addition, detectives admitted to careless handling of Marcia's body, stating that they simply cut her blouse and pants off in the shed without wearing protective gloves. Barrett's record * Sarah Des Prez, a Vanderbilt student, was murdered about three weeks before Marcia Trimble. Metro's Cold Case Unit was able to apply new DNA analysis to evidence from the Des Prez murder to bring charges against Barrett. At the announcement of the arrest of Barrett, police suggested that he might have murdered Marcia. The police said that Barrett's whereabouts and crimes during the period of Marcia's murder had placed him under increased scrutiny. * On February 17, 1975, a Belmont University student was raped in Nashville. Jerome Barrett was arrested in March, 1975, in connection with this crime. He was convicted of it a year later. ** Barrett had been in jail from March 12, 1975, fifteen days after Marcia's disappearance, until after Marcia's body was found. * On December 3, 2007, Nashville television stations reported that DNA recovered from the Trimble crime scene matched that of Barrett. \\"Advances in DNA testing enabled a match between crime-scene evidence and Jerome Barrett, a 60-year-old Memphis man with a criminal record of sexual assaults on both grown women and children.\\"E. Thomas Wood and Ken Whitehouse, Impact upon Nashville Residents were upset by the fact that the victim was a child, and that the crime took place in an affluent neighborhood. This was at a time when people felt that their children were safe. The delay in finding and recovering the girl's body also disturbed people. FBI agents were brought in to assist with the investigation.E. Thomas Wood, After Womack's release in 1980, residents continued to be haunted by this unsolved murder. Each year, Nashville media highlighted the story on the anniversary of Marcia's disappearance or of the discovery of her body. The case marked a time of great change in how news was covered by local media, and in the emerging importance of DNA evidence (not well understood in earlier years).

History In 1820, Salomon Mayer von Rothschild established the first bank in Vienna, then the capital of the Austrian Empire. In the course of early industrialisation, the Rothschild bank financed large development projects, such as the building of the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway to the Moravian mining regions. Rothschild also acted as a generous lender to Austrian state chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich and granted copious credits to the Bohemian and Hungarian aristocracy. Austria- Hungary Former Creditanstalt headquarters on Schottengasse in Vienna Interior view of the former headquarters in Vienna The Creditanstalt was founded in 1855 by Rothschild's son, Anselm, as the K. k. priv. √ñsterreichische Credit-Anstalt f√ºr Handel und Gewerbe (approximate translation: Imperial royal privileged Austrian Credit Institute for Commerce and Industry). Being very successful, it soon became the largest bank in Austria-Hungary. Anselm's son, Albert, took control of the Credit-Anstalt in 1872 and was succeeded in 1911 by his son, Louis. In 1912, the firm's new headquarters in Vienna's Innere Stadt opened in a lavishly decorated Neoclassical building, which is still preserved to the present day. First Republic The business situation dramatically changed with Austria's defeat in the First World War and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and empire. In the late 1920s, a principal debtor, the Steyr-Werke AG, faced financial difficulties, with bad loans leading to a drain on finances. In October 1929, the Schober government compelled the allegedly well-financed Credit-Anstalt to assume liabilities, which together with the simultaneous Wall Street Crash led to the financial imbalance of the then-largest Austrian credit provider. Creditanstalt had to declare bankruptcy on 11 May 1931. This was one of the first major bank failures that initiated the Great Depression. \\"Potential for black swan 'Credit Anstalt' event,\\" Variant Perception, 10 May 2010 In fact, the failure of the Creditanstalt is what sent shockwaves throughout Europe, quickly spreading the Great Depression. However, Chancellor Otto Ender rescued Creditanstalt by distributing the enormous share of costs between the Republic, Austria's central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the Rothschild family. Nationalization plans advanced by the Social Democrats were rejected. However, the institute was de facto state-owned after Chancellor Engelbert Dollfu√ü in 1934 ordered the merger of the institute with the Wiener Bankverein, thus changing its name to Creditanstalt-Bankverein. The firm's bankruptcy and its impact in producing a major global banking crisis provided a major propaganda opportunity for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party: it allowed them to further blame Jews for German and international economic and social troubles. Following the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, Creditanstalt-Bankverein was targeted for both financial and racial reasons. Louis de Rothschild was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the losses suffered by the Austrian state when the bank collapsed. Deprived of his position and property, he migrated to the U.S. in 1939 after more than one year in custody. Creditanstalt-Bankverein was later taken over by Deutsche Bank, patronized by Hermann Josef Abs. Though CEO Josef Joham made contact with the Office of Strategic Services, Creditanstalt also settled the financial issues of several Nazi concentration camps as well as the \\"Aryanization\\" of Jewish-owned businesses, like the re-establishment of Sascha-Film as Wien-Film Limited. Second Republic After World War II, the bank was nationalized by Allied-occupied Austria in 1946. It became mainly a commercial bank and was highly involved in Austria's economy, holding stakes in important Austrian companies such as Wienerberger, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, Lenzing AG and Semperit. From 1956 onwards, Creditanstalt was again partly privatized by issuing 40% in shares, though only 10% in common stock. In 1981, the former Social Democratic Minister of Finance Hannes Androsch assumed the office of a general manager, after he had left the Kreisky cabinet. Industrial interests were reduced, while the government ownership share fell to 51%. In the 1980s, Creditanstalt opened branches in London, New York and Hong Kong, while the international orientation towards East-Central Europe was boosted by the fall of the Iron Curtain upon the Revolutions of 1989. Nevertheless, after several difficult lending operations, Creditanstalt became an acquisition candidate. In 1997, the state-owned shares were sold to Bank Austria (BA), resulting in a crisis in the ruling coalition between the Social Democratic Party and the conservative Austrian People's Party, since Creditanstalt was considered to be part of the conservative sphere of influence, whereas BA with its roots as Red Vienna's Central Savings Bank (Zentralsparkasse) was considered to be on the political left.

Between 2011 and 2016 she was the Makar, or National Poet of Scotland.  Early life  Elizabeth Anne Lochhead was born in Craigneuk, a ‚Äúlittle ex-mining village just outside Motherwell‚Äù, Lanarkshire. Her mother and father had both served in the army during the Second World War, and later, her father was a local government clerk. In 1952 the family moved into a new council house in the mining village of Newarthill, where her sister was born in 1957. Though she was encouraged by her teachers to study English, Lochhead was determined to go to Glasgow School of Art where she studied between 1965 and 1970. After graduation Lochhead taught art at High Schools in Glasgow and Bristol, a career at which she says she was \\"terrible\\" Career Having written poetry as a child and whilst studying at Art School, Liz Lochhead won a BBC Scotland Poetry Competition in 1971 and Gordon Wright published her first collection of Poetry, Memo For Spring in 1972 under his Reprographia imprint. It is often claimed that at this time Lochhead was part of a Philip Hobsbaum writers' group, a crucible of creative activity ‚Äì with other members including Alasdair Gray, James Kelman, Tom Leonard, Aonghas MacNeacail and Jeff Torrington,Peter Childs and Michael Storry (eds), The Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture. Routledge: 2009, p.311. Liz Lochhead has repeatedly claimed this to be an invention. She has however recalled the support and inspiration she drew from the Scottish poetry scene of the early 1970s and meetings with the elder generation - Norman MacCaig, Edwin Morgan, Robert Garioch - and with contemporaries such as Leonard, Kelman and Gray. Lochhead went on to produce revue shows with Leonard and Gray, including Tickly Mince, and The Pie of Damocles. Other the following years Lochhead published further collections Islands (1978) and The Grimm Sisters (1979) and moved first to Toronto as part of the first Scottish/Canadian writers exchange and later made her home in New York. In 1986 she returned permanently to Glasgow. Lochhead's success in poetry was rivalled by her writing for the theatre. Her plays include Blood and Ice (1982), Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off (1987), Perfect Days (2000) and a highly acclaimed adaptation into Scots of Moli√®re's Tartuffe (1985). She adapted the medieval texts of the York Mystery Plays, performed by a largely amateur cast at York Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996. Her adaptation of Euripides' Medea won the Saltire Society Scottish Book of the Year Award in 2001. Her plays have been performed on BBC Radio 4: Blood and Ice (11 June 1990), The Perfect Days (16 May 1999), Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off (11 February 2001) and The Stanley Baxter Playhouse: Mortal Memories (26 June 2006). Her adaptation of Helen Simpson's short story Burns and the Bankers was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Burns Night, 25 January 2012.BBC ‚Äì Afternoon Drama ‚Äì Burns and the Bankers Her plays Educating Agnes and Thebans premiered in the early 2000s, and in 2011 as part of the Glasgay Festival, Liz Lochhead's play Edwin Morgan's Dreams and Other Nightmares premiered at the Tron and it was revived three years later as part of the cultural celebrations for the commonwealth games. She has produced many new works for the Oran Mor in Glasgow, including Mortal Memories (2012) and Between the Thinks Bubble and the Speech Balloon (2014) with Tom Leonard, William Letford, Grace Cleary, and Henry Bell. Like her work for theatre, her poetry is alive with vigorous speech idioms; later collections include True Confessions and New Clich√©s (1985), Bagpipe Muzak (1991), Dreaming Frankenstein: and Collected Poems (1984), The Colour of Black and White (2003) and A Choosing (2011). Liz Lochhead also enjoys writing songs and combining poetry with music and she has collaborated with Dundee singer-songwriter Michael Marra to whom she dedicated the poem 'Ira and George'.'Ira and George', The Colour of Black and White (Polygon: 2003), p.8 as well as providing guest vocals on the track 'Trouble is Not a Place' from the 2014 EP The Bird That Never Flew by Glaswegian experimental hip hop group Hector Bizerk. She has also collaborated extensively with saxophonist Steve Kettley and Dundonian band The Hazey Janes. Liz Lochhead performs internationally in theatres and literary festivals, as well as appearing regularly at nights around Glasgow and Edinburgh.  Honours and awards  In 2005, Lochhead became the Poet Laureate for Glasgow, a position she held until stepping down in 2011, when she was named as the second Scots Makar, or national poet of Scotland, succeeding Edwin Morgan who had died the previous year. She stepped down from this role in February 2016, and was succeeded by Jackie Kay in March 2016. She is currently the Honorary President of the Caledonian Cultural Fellows at Glasgow Caledonian University. and holds honorary doctorates from ten of Scotland's universities.

She has been a firm opponent of the Israeli Occupation and a supporter of the call for a cultural boycott of Israel. In 2014 she helped produce A Bird is Not a Stone, an anthology of contemporary Palestinian poetry translated into the languages of Scotland. Lochhead is openly critical of Scottish arts funding body Creative Scotland.  Personal life  In 1986 Liz Lochhead married the architect Tom Logan. They lived together in Glasgow until his death in 2010. After his death she wrote the poem Favourite Place about their caravan on the West Coast of Scotland. It ends: :But tonight you are three months dead :and I must pull down the bed and lie in it alone. :Tomorrow, and every day in this place :these words of Sorley MacLean‚Äôs will echo through me: :The world is still beautiful, though you are not in it. :And this will not be a consolation :but a further desolation.

It is a personal diary of people who have and continue to inspire me and open my mind to different ways of seeing and thinking. The spectrum of individuals photographed in our Spring/Summer 2016 ad campaign represent a celebration of my America.\\" Adding, \\"The people featured in our campaign personify this collection of fashion through their individuality. Collectively, they embody and celebrate the spirit and beauty of equality.\\" Dena Silver, from The Observer.com, called it \\"the best campaign of the Spring 2016 season.\\" She then elaborates about what makes this campaign notable: \\"The designer (Marc Jacobs) has handpicked a star studded cast of his family members to model the Americana gear from this collection.\\" Adding \\"Technically speaking, none of the people in this series of photographs are related to Mr. Jacobs by blood, but rather, they're people who mean a lot to the Marc Jacobs brand.\\" The Marc Jacobs Spring 2016 advertising campaign featured Lana Wachowski, Sandra Bernhard, Bette Midler, Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci, Sky Ferreira, Bella Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski as well as lesser known artists Vincent Michaud,http://www.vincentmichaud.vision/modelhttps://www.marcjacobs.com/adcampaigns/CAMPAIGN_SS16_SET.html?fdid=adcampaigns Oli Burslem, and Milk, a contestant from RuPaul's Drag Race, as well as several runway models.http://observer.com/2016/02/marc-jacobs-casts-his- family-in-this-spring-2016-ad-campaign/ Personal life and causes Jacobs has an ongoing project entitled, \\"Protect The Skin You're In\\", which has celebrities pose nude, with their breasts and frontal area covered, for T-shirts to raise awareness about melanoma; all sales benefit research at the NYU Langone Medical Center.

In addition, he is also the author of a trilogy of sword-and-sorcery fantasy novels: \\"The Man in the Skirt\\", \\"Banshee Moon\\" and \\"The Keeper\\". In 1997 he began touring promoting his wacky and zany poetry. This has included many performances at schools, libraries and festivals in the UK and beyond, in Germany, Luxembourg and other venues. In addition, his best-selling book, The Spot on My Bum, was translated into Portuguese in 2012 under the title A Borbulha No Rabo, by Portuguese poet Helder Moulder Pereira. In April 2018 he co-founded the charity Platform 1 in huddersfield .  Poems  Gez Walsh burst onto the poetry scene in 1997 armed with his first collection of children's verse, The Spot on My Bum: Horrible Poems for Horrible Children, which was rapidly to become a cult classic. Written in response to his dyslexic son's need for stimulating, approachable reading material, Gez decided to use humour as his tool to encourage interest. Quickly realising he'd hit on a successful method of providing reluctant readers with enthusiasm, Gez's world of laughter sprang into life. Soon it was not only his son enjoying hilarious performances of these poems, but a much wider audience of enthusiasts at schools, festivals, book signings and charity events. Adding to his range of material for an ever-growing army of fans Gez penned The Return of The Spot: More Horrible Poems for More Horrible Children (1997). Encouraged by this success Gez decided to try and further his appeal by branching out into fiction. In 1998 volume one of the Celtic Chronicles trilogy, The Man in The Skirt, was published and promptly reviewed on popular children's television programme Fully Booked. A year later in 1999 his followers were presented with his next poetry offering, Someone's Nicked My Knickers: Poems to Make Your Toes Curl, then, in 2000, Parents, Zits and Hairy Bits: The World According to Wilf, a big hit with teenagers. Towards the end of 2001 Fido's Foul Surprise And Other 'Ruff' Rhymes hit the bookshops, closely followed by the second volume of the comedy-horror Celtic Chronicles, Banshee Moon. 2002 saw Gez's sixth potty poetry collection, Norah's Nasty Knickers: Crazy Poems for Cool Kids come into being, receiving a warm reception from fans and generating media interest, while 2003 provided the much-awaited concluding volume to the Celtic Chronicles trilogy in the shape of The Keeper. Alongside Gez's Potty Poets titles, the first book in the author's new educational series, Fax 4 U, was released, entitled Drugs - Booze, Glue, Cigs and Coffee, too!, part of a set of books aimed at broaching issues facing 21st century young people. The end of the year also heralded the entry of Don't Wee in the Bath, Terry!: Potty Poems with a Capital \\"P\\", the author's eleventh book. 2004 proved a busy time for Gez. Writing and performing full-time took his unique brand of humour to schools, libraries and festivals around the country with his reputation as a motivator of reluctant readers growing alongside his popularity. Bringing Gez's published work to the dozen mark was the author's most recent poetry collection, Mum, the Dog's Drunk Again! Horribly Potty Poems for Horribly Horrid Kids. This brought Gez to the attention of the nation once more as BBC's Look North televised his comic poetry performance during a World Book Day celebration in a Yorkshire school, while Radio Five Live also featured Gez's antics. Since the publication of \\"Mum, The Dog's Drunk Again\\", Gez Walsh has concentrated his writing in other directions. While he continued keeping faith with the Potty Poets brand by working on \\"Great Aunt Fanny's Moustache\\" which is still forthcoming, Walsh has really been concentrating on his new series of fiction for young adults, Twisted Minds. Volume 1 of this series, The Meeting Room, was originally published initially as a digital book for download only; however, it is due for release in book form in late 2014. In the meantime, two other volumes, Changes and Diva Dave and Fat Sue, have appeared both in book form and as e-books. Walsh has also developed a stand-up act for adult audiences, and regularly presents the Wednesday afternoon show on Phoenix FM Radio in Calderdale, West Yorkshire. In the summer of 2014 he was appointed as the official \\"poet laureate\\" of Calderdale. Also, at the same time, he was the poet in residence at the Orange Box, a community arts centre in Halifax, West Yorkshire.

It allowed users of the Microsoft Windows operating system to change the appearance of their mouse cursor and to allow websites to use customized cursors for visitors. The product installed itself without user permission and is an early example of spyware. History Comet Systems was founded in 1997. Its most famous product, Comet Cursor, was released the same year for free. When installed, Comet Cursor changes a user's mouse cursor when they visit participating websites. Websites could use these cursors to display their own brands instead of standard icons. By 1999, there were 55,000 websites using the technology, including Comedy Central, Mattel, and Warner Bros. Banner ads also used the technology. Comet reported 20 million users in 2001, when it integrated a price comparison service in the software. The company was criticized for secretly tracking users who installed the software, each of whom was given a unique serial number. In November 1999, the company started distributing its software as part of a package with several versions of RealNetworks' RealPlayer multimedia software. That same month, the RealPlayer was accused of violating the privacy of its users and breaching its own privacy policy by collecting information about what software was installed alongside the RealPlayer. Compounding the issue of spyware, the software installed itself unknowingly on many users' computers. Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser allowed ActiveX controls, such as Comet Cursor, to install themselves with no user interaction and without asking permission, and users did not realize they had installed Comet Cursor with RealPlayer. For these reasons, Comet Cursor was cited as one of the 25 Worst Tech Products by PC World. Although no longer distributed, the product has been blacklisted as spyware by some internet watchdog companies such as Lavasoft and Symantec. Microsoft recommends that users who experience problems with the application uninstall it. FindWhat.com purchased Comet in February 2004, and the Comet Cursor was phased out of their product line.

Joseph Holland, center) addresses the conspirators including Brutus (Orson Welles, left). Et tu, Brute? () is a Latin phrase literally meaning 'and you, Brutus?' or 'also you, Brutus?', often translated as 'You as well, Brutus?' or 'Even you, Brutus?'. The quote appears in Act 3 Scene 1 of William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, where it is spoken by the Roman dictator Julius Caesar, at the moment of his assassination, to his friend Marcus Junius Brutus, upon recognizing him as one of the assassins. The first known occurrences of the phrase are said to be in two earlier Elizabethan plays; Henry VI, Part 3 by Shakespeare, and an even earlier play, Caesar Interfectus, by Richard Edes. The phrase is often used apart from the plays to signify an unexpected betrayal by a friend. There is no evidence that the historical Caesar spoke these words.Henle, Robert J., S.J. Henle Latin Year 1 Chicago: Loyola Press 1945 Though the historical Caesar's last words are not known with certainty, the Roman historian Suetonius, a century and a half after the incident, claims Caesar said nothing as he died, but that others reported that Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase ,...uno modo ad primum ictum gemitu sine voce edito; etsi tradiderunt quidam Marco Bruto irruenti dixisse \\"Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÉœç, œÑŒ≠Œ∫ŒΩŒøŒΩ\\". De Vita Caesarum, Liber I, Divus Iulius, LXXXII.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Julius Caesar 82.2 which means 'You too, child?' or 'You too, young man?' to Brutus. Another commonly quoted variation of this Greek sentence in Latin is Tu quoque, Brute? Contrary to popular belief, the words are not Caesar's last in the play, as he says \\"Then fall Caesar!\\" right after.  Etymology  The name Brutus, a second declension masculine noun, appears in the phrase in the vocative case, and so the ‚Äëus ending of the nominative case is replaced by ‚Äëe.  Context  On March 15 (the Ides of March), 44 BC, the historic Caesar was attacked by a group of senators, including Brutus, who was Caesar's friend and prot√©g√©. Caesar initially resisted his attackers, but when he saw Brutus, he reportedly responded as he died. Suetonius mentions the quote merely as a rumor, as does Plutarch who also reports that Caesar said nothing, but merely pulled his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators.Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, Life of Caesar 66.9 Caesar saying Et tu, Brute? in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar (1599) was not the first time the phrase was used in a dramatic play. Edmond Malone claimed that it appeared in a work that has since been lost‚ÄîRichard Eedes's Latin play Caesar Interfectus of 1582. The phrase had also occurred in another play by Shakespeare, The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixth, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses Lancaster and Yorke of 1595, which is the earliest printed version of Henry VI, Part 3.Garber, Marjorie. Shakespeare's Ghost Writers: Literature as Uncanny Causality. Routledge, 2010. . p. 72-73  Interpretation  It has been argued that the phrase can be interpreted as a curse or warning. One theory states that the historic Caesar adapted the words of a Greek sentence which to the Romans had long since become proverbial: The complete phrase is said to have been \\"You too, my son, will have a taste of power,\\" of which Caesar only needed to invoke the opening words to foreshadow Brutus' own violent death, in response to his assassination.Woodman, A. J. The Annals of Tacitus: Books 5‚Äì6; Volume 55 of Cambridge Classical Texts and Commentaries. Cambridge University Press, 2016. . The poem Satires; Book I, Satire 7 by Horace, written approximately 30 BC, mentions Brutus and his tyrannicide; in discussing that poem, author John Henderson considers that the expression E-t t-u Br-u-t-e, (as he hyphenates it), can be interpreted as a complaint containing a \\"suggestion of mimetic compulsion\\".

She muses on the aspects of her life that are driving her away, while \\"in her nostrils was the odor of dusty cretonne\\". Her mother has died as has her older brother Ernest. Her remaining brother, Harry, is on the road \\"in the church decorating business\\". She fears that her father will beat her as he used to beat her brothers and she has little loyalty for her sales job. She has fallen for a sailor named Frank who promises to take her with him to Buenos Aires. Before leaving to meet Frank, she hears an organ grinder outside, which reminds her of a melody that played on an organ on the day her mother died and the promise she made to her mother to look after the home.

The comet goldfish can be distinguished from the common goldfish by its long, single and deeply forked tail fin. Comets with yellow, orange, red, white, and red-and-white coloration are common. The red coloration mainly appears on the tailfin and dorsal fin, but can also appear on the pelvic fin. The comet is more active than most other goldfish breeds. It is not unusual to see a comet dashing back and forth in its tank, racing around in a playful manner. Due to the comet's hardy and active nature, and the relative ease in caring for them, they are the breed best suited to ponds and outdoor pools. They are often kept with koi in outdoor ponds. Comets have a natural life span of 5 to 14 years and may live even longer in optimal conditions.Keeping Comet Goldfish Variants A juvenile Sarasa goldfish. * Sarasa comets are characterized by their red-and-white coloration and resemble the K≈çhaku color pattern in koi. Sarasa Comets have long flowing fins and are very hardy fish. Although the Sarasa Comet is originally from China, the word 'sarasa' is of Japanese origin. * The Tancho single-tail is similar to the comet-tail but it has a silver-colored body and fins with a single red patch on the head. Goldfish farming Goldfish are commonly bred on fish farms in many parts of the world. In most instances, the fish produced are offered for sale to aquarists. However, in North America, there is a demand for goldfish used as bait or \\"feeder fish\\" to other fish by anglers. Due to the relatively inexpensive prices of comet goldfish, they may also be used as prizes in carnivals or other places of entertainment.

It used a cordite cartridge to move a piston, which cranked the engine. The Coffman system was one of the most common brands; another was the Breeze cartridge system, which was produced under Coffman patents. Most American military aircraft and tanks which used radial engines were equipped with this system. Some versions of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine used in the British Supermarine Spitfire used the Coffman system as a starter. The Hawker Typhoon also used the Coffman system to start its Napier Sabre engine. Cartridge starters used on a number of jet engines, including such engines as the Rolls-Royce Avon, which were used in the English Electric Canberra and Hawker Hunter, used a high gas volume cartridge driving a turbine instead of a piston. Some Snowcat and similar vehicles used in extreme low temperatures were historically equipped with cartridge start.  Design  The Coffman device used a large blank cartridge containing Cordite that, when fired, pushed a piston forward. A screw thread driven by the piston engaged with the engine, turning it over. This was in contrast with other type of cartridge starter which acted directly to drive the engine piston down and so turn the rest of the engine over, such as those used on the Field-Marshall agricultural diesel tractor. The other systems used during the period were electric motors (such as those used in automobiles today), inertia starters (cranked either by hand or an electric motor) and compressed-air starters, which operated much like Coffman starters but were powered by pressurized air tanks. Shotgun starters are composed of a breech, into which the cartridge is inserted, which is connected to the motor by a short steel pipe, which acts like a gun barrel. The blank cartridge fits into the breech, and is triggered either electrically or mechanically. When the aircraft's ignition is turned on and the cartridge is fired, high-velocity, high-pressure gas (~ at ~) shoots down the pipe, forcing the motor to spin and engage the starter ring gear on the engine, which is attached to the crankshaft. Shotgun starters had several advantages over other starting systems in use at the time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to engage the starter ring gear. The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, and it did not require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas. The primary disadvantages of the shotgun starter are the need to keep a stock of cartridges, one of which is used for each attempt to start, and the short time that the motor is spun by each cartridge. Compressed-air starters, which use the same type of motor, are usually recharged by an engine-driven compressor, negating the need to carry cartridges, but adding requirements for the compressor and air tank. Hybrid systems can be made simply by adding a cartridge breech or an air tank to an existing system. Air tanks can also be recharged from an external source in an emergency, such as a hand pump or a portable air compressor. The Coffman starter was the most common brand of cartridge starters during the mid-1930s, and the name was used as a generic description. Advances in electrical technology have made shotgun starters obsolete for most uses.

Waverly Press, Baltimore (MD) 1928. viii, 409 pages, 24 cm. online was a Baltic German-born Austrian military leader, he was the son of Count Peter von Lacy and was a famous Austrian field marshal. He served during the reign of Maria Theresa and was a close friend to Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, becoming one of the latter's advisers. Lacy was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. Early life Armorial of Franz Moritz von Lacy His father, Count Peter von Lacy, was a Russian Field Marshal who belonged to the Irish branch of the de Lacy family and had followed James II into exile. His mother, Countess Margareta Philippina von Lacy, nee von Funcken, was a Baltic German.Clark, George. Irish Soldiers in Europe, 17th-19th Century, pub.2010. Franz Moritz was born in St Petersburg, and was educated in Germany for a military career, and entered the Austrian service. He served in Italy, Bohemia, Silesia and the Netherlands during the War of the Austrian Succession, was twice wounded, and by the end of the war was a lieutenant-colonel. At the age of twenty-five he became full colonel and chief of an infantry regiment. Seven Years' War In 1756 with the opening of the Seven Years' War he was again on active service, and in the first battle (Lobositz) he distinguished himself so much that he was at once promoted major-general. He received his third wound on this occasion and his fourth at the battle of Prague in 1757. Later in 1757 Lacy bore a conspicuous part in the great victory of Breslau, and at Leuthen, where he received his fifth wound, he covered the retreat of the defeated army. Soon after this began his association with Field-Marshal Daun, the new generalissimo of the empress's forces, and these two commanders, powerfully assisted later by the genius of Laudon, made headway against Frederick the Great for the remainder of the war. Lacy, a lieutenant field-marshal at thirty-two, was made chief of staff (quartermaster-general) to Daun in the newly created general staff. They were cautious to the point of timidity since Leuthen and many other bitter defeats had taught the Austrians to respect Frederick; but, having resolved to wear out the enemy by Fabian methods, they were strong enough to persist to the end. Thus for some years the life of Lacy, as of Daun and Laudon, is the story of the war against Prussia. After Hochkirch (October 15, 1758) Lacy received the Grand Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa. In 1759 both Daun and Lacy fell into disfavour for failing to win victories, and Lacy owed his promotion to Feldzeugmeister only to the fact that Laudon had just received this rank for the brilliant conduct of his detachment at Kunersdorf. He shadowed Frederick the Great's Prussian army during the failed Siege of Dresden in 1760. His responsibilities told heavily on Lacy in the ensuing campaigns, and his capacity for supreme command was doubted even by Daun, who refused to give him the command when he himself was wounded at Torgau. Later career Tomb of Franz Moritz von Lacy in the Schwarzenbergpark in Neuwaldegg, Vienna After the Treaty of rg a new sphere of activity was opened, in which Lacy's special gifts had the greatest scope. Maria Theresa having placed her son, Emperor Joseph II, at the head of Austrian military affairs, Lacy was made a field marshal, and given the task of reforming and administering the army (1766). He framed new regulations for each arm, a new code of military law, a good supply system. As the result of his work the Austrian army was more numerous, far better equipped, and cheaper than it had ever been before. Joseph soon became very intimate with his military adviser, but this did not prevent his mother, after she became estranged from the young emperor, from giving Lacy her full confidence. His activities were not confined to the army. He was in sympathy with Joseph's innovations, and was regarded by Maria Theresa as a prime mover in the scheme for the partition of Poland. But his self-imposed work broke down Lacy's health, and in 1773, in spite of the remonstrances of Maria Theresa and of the emperor, he laid down all his offices and went to southern France. On returning he was still unable to resume office, though as an unofficial adviser in political and military matters he was far from idle. Marble bust of Franz Moritz von Lacy by Giuseppe Ceracci. Arms of Franz Moritz von Lacy from his crypt in Vienna In the brief and uneventful War of the Bavarian Succession, Lacy and Laudon were the chief Austrian commanders against the King of Prussia, and when Joseph II at Maria Theresa's death, became the sovereign of the Austrian dominions as well as emperor, Lacy remained his most trusted friend. More serious than the War of the Bavarian Succession was the Turkish war which presently broke out. Lacy was now old and worn out, and his tenure of command therein was not marked by any greater measure of success than in the case of the other Austrian generals. His active career was at an end, although he continued his effective interest in the affairs of the state and the army throughout the reign of Joseph's successor, Leopold II. His last years were spent in retirement at his castle of Neuwaldegg near Vienna. He is buried in a mausoleum in the castle grounds. Ancestry His father was Peter Lacy.

As Chief Justice, he presided over both the High Court and the Supreme Court, but was constitutionally barred from presiding over, or even sitting on, the Appeal Court. On 3 January 2007, he was sent on leave by the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, which had seized power on 5 December 2006. On 19 January, he was formally suspended, pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct. This investigation was dropped in December 2008 as part of a deal that involved his formal resignation. Earlier life and career Fatiaki was born in Upu village in the district of Motusa, on the island of Rotuma, which enjoys a considerable degree of internal autonomy from Fiji. He moved with his family to Suva, the Fijian capital, for schooling. After attending Marist Brothers Primary School, he went on to study at Marist Brothers High School from 1967 to 1970. He enrolled in the Foundation Programme at the University of the South Pacific for one year, and won the Morris Hedstrom scholarship to study Law at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, from which he graduated in 1976. Fatiaki practiced Law in New Zealand from 1977 to 1979, and in Fiji from 1979 to 1984. He was then appointed to the post of Commissioner for Oaths in Fiji. He later served as Fatiaki was previously Chairman of the Fiji Law Reform Commission in 1994 and 1995. Controversial appointment Fatiaki's appointment was not without controversy. Then Opposition leader Prem Singh objected on the grounds that in the midst of the Fiji coup of 2000, Fatiaki had joined Tuivaga and Justice Michael Scott in advising the then President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to abrogate the constitution, in accordance with the wishes of the Military. Mara refused, and resigned. The three Justices subsequently recognised the Interim Military Government of Commodore Frank Bainimarama, and drafted decrees abrogating the constitution, abolishing the Supreme Court, making the Chief Justice the President of the Appeal Court, and raising the retirement age of the Chief Justice from 70 years to 75. (These changes were later reversed after a High Court decision reinstating the constitution on 15 November 2000 was upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001. Rev. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, a human rights group, said that Fatiaki's participation in such anticonstitutional actions should disqualify him from holding the office of Chief Justice, and suggested that as the judiciary had been thoroughly compromised politically, it would be best for the time being to appoint a Chief Justice from outside of Fiji (the constitution allows members of the judiciary, unlike other government officials, to be non- citizens, and it is not unusual for retired judges from other Commonwealth countries to be appointed to the bench). Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase disagreed, however, and President Ratu Josefa Iloilo (who had taken office on 13 July 2000) appointed Fatiaki on his advice, saying he was confident that Fatiaki would maintain the same standards of integrity that Tuivaga had upheld. The 2006 coup=Forced leave In the wake of the military coup that deposed the Qarase government on 5 December 2006, Commodore Josaia Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama, the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and Acting President of Fiji, sent Fatiaki on leave. He told the Fiji Times on 7 January that he had been told to go on leave or be dismissed. Earlier, Fatiaki had said just before the coup that the judiciary would uphold the Fijian constitution and would go down with it if it were abrogated, the Fiji Times quoted him on 5 December (the day of the coup) as having told a conference at the Shangri-La's Fijian Resort in Yanuca, Sigatoka that weekend. Criticism of Acting Chief Justice Fatiaki condemned as a \\"disgrace\\" the appointment of Anthony Gates as Acting Chief Justice on 16 January, saying it was unconstitutional and compromised the integrity and independence of the judiciary. He criticised fellow-Judge Nazhat Shameem for her role in the decision, saying that she had unlawfully chaired a meeting of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and written to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo on behalf of the JSC, identifying herself as Chair of the JSC, which is in fact a role reserved for the Chief Justice, recommending the appointment of Gates. He condemned this as a disgraceful and cowardly act, which he denounced as a betrayal of his trust and of the judiciary, and said, contrary to assertions from Shameem and interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, that his leave of absence was forced, not voluntary. Attorney-General Khaiyum said that Shameem had chaired the meeting on his orders, not her own initiative. Return to work In an act of defiance towards his forced leave and the appointment of Justice Gates as Acting Chief Justice, on 18 January 2007 Justice Fatiaki returned to work at his office, saying in interviews: > \\"I have never ceased to be the Chief Justice of this nation. I have decided > that the time is right for me to come back and I am no longer going to wait > for people to recall me. People are telling me that I'm voluntarily on > leave, well lets see...I voluntarily also return to the office. At this > point in time the acting Chief Justice ceases to function because I'm back > in my office. The Chief Justice is back in his office and back heading the > judiciary where he belongs. I don't have guns, all I have is my conscience > and power of the rule of law. If this government is true to its word and > supports the independence of the judiciary then I have nothing to fear at > all.\\" After this, a team of RFMF soldiers arrived at his office, asking him to leave the premises, followed by a visit to his chambers by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Jahir Khan along with Police's Elite Tactical Response Team officers. It is understood that Khan asked Justice Fatiaki to voluntarily vacate the chambers, and later escorted him to a police vehicle reportedly to drop him at his Suva residence. Interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum later accused him of having tried to illegally remove from his office documents that are subject to an investigation into his alleged role in the 2000 coup, claims that Fatiaki angrily denied. He could not have removed any documents, he said, as two military officers were with him the entire time. Formally suspended On 19 January 2007, it was revealed that President Ratu Josefa Iloilo had signed a decree formally suspending Fatiaki, pending an inquiry into allegations that he had been involved in the 2000 coup, to the extent of drafting decrees and giving legal advice to coup frontman George Speight. Fiji Law Society President Devanesh Sharma condemned Fatiaki's suspension and threatened legal action. On 22 January, it was announced that on 10 January, a directive from the Prime Minister's Office had banned Fatiaki from leaving Fiji. Parmesh Chand, the chief executive officer of the Prime Minister's Office, informed the Chief Registrar's Office that while Fatiaki was suspended, he would be banned from attending any meetings or conferences abroad. From 20 to 24 January, he had been scheduled to attend international meetings of jurists in Karachi, Pakistan, and in Perth, Australia. Meanwhile, Fatiaki announced on 22 January that he was preparing to take legal action against his suspension. Resignation Fatiaki formally resigned as Chief Justice on 5 December 2008. This came as a part of a deal with the interim government, under which he would receive a full pension and a F$275,000 payout, the state would discontinue its investigation into allegations of abuse of office and corruption while he was Chief Justice, and he in turn would drop (within seven days) all legal proceedings against the interim government. Both sides undertook not to pursue any future legal action against the other. Opinions In an address to the convention of the Fiji Law Society at Warwick Hotel on the Coral Coast on 2 July 2005, Fatiaki called on the legal profession to uphold standards of integrity. It was important, he said, for the legal profession to be \\"independent of any centres of power, whether public or private, and of any cause.\\" He maintained that the most valuable asset of any profession was its collective reputation. Vanuatu Fatiaki has served as a judge on the Supreme Court of Vanuatu. Personal life Daniel Fatiaki is a Roman Catholic and a native of Rotuma, a Fijian Dependency which enjoys a measure of autonomy but is otherwise integrated into Fiji politically and economically despite its cultural divergence (Rotumans are Polynesian, unlike ethnic Fijians, who are predominantly of Melanesian stock). He is the first Rotuman to be appointed to the bench in Fiji, and his appointment as Chief Justice resulted in great public rejoicing on the island. Fatiaki is the son of Anselmo Fatiaki, who was one of the first Rotumans to graduate from university. He has 5 brothers - Seforana, John, Alec, Joachim, and Christopher. He has one sister named Violet. He is married to Martha and has 4 sons. He was made a Companion of the Order of Fiji, together with Sir Vijay Singh, in 2004.

Fred Zinn lived in Battle Creek, Michigan. While visiting France in August 1914, he joined the French Foreign Legion shortly after the outbreak of World War I. He was one of the group who signed the American Volunteer Corps flag in Paris on October 17, 1914, before departing for Rouen. He served on the Western Front until February 1, 1916, when he was wounded for the second time during a German artillery attack. Zinn transferred to the French A√©ronautique Militaire on February 14, 1916. He served as gunner and bombardier with Escadrille F-14 from December 12, 1916, until October 21, 1917, often augmenting his bombing duties by taking reconnaissance photographs of enemy lines before returning to base. Zinn was one of the first aviators to attempt to photograph enemy troop positions from the air to assist commanders on the ground. This had previously been done from manned balloons, but they were vulnerable to enemy fire and had to be kept behind the lines. By flying directly over enemy positions and taking photographs, Zinn provided French commanders with a far better view of the battlefield, and the techniques he and others developed soon became standard practice for both sides in the trench warfare style conflict. He was decorated twice by the French government for bravery for flying low over enemy lines on these reconnaissance missions. Although not formally assigned to the American Lafayette Escadrille, Zinn was recorded as an observer for the Escadrille, presumably while taking aerial photographs. After the United States entered the war in 1917, Zinn entered the U.S. Army Air Service as a captain and was attached to American GHQ at Chaumont until the Armistice on November 11, 1918. He was one of a small number of Legionnaires who entered the war in August 1914 to survive over four years of active service and over three full years in combat units. Some French Foreign Legion units had close to 100% casualties in the intense trench warfare. At the close of war, Zinn remained in Europe leading a team of what could only be called investigators, with the mission to research, locate, recover and identify American Airmen who were listed as Missing in Action. In Blaine Lee Pardoe's book, Lost Eagles: One Man's Mission to Find Missing Airmen in Two World Wars, which is about Zinn's mission after the war, he notes Zinn was highly successful and credits Zinn with being the \\"first person to conceive of the idea that missing men could be found, identified, and brought back to the arms of their country and to the hearts of their surviving families. He pioneered the concept of never leaving a man behind.\\" This mission he carried through even after he returned home and to this day, his files in the National Archives are among the most requested. His success and methods were so well known that he was employed during World War ll to find more missing American aviators. Zinn returned to the United States after the war and continued flying, including a trip to San Francisco where his biplane was required to fly only over the waters of San Francisco Bay due to a perceived danger to citizens if it traveled over land.

Elsie Tanner was one of the original core characters on Coronation Street and appeared in the first episode. She is considered something of an icon in soap history and regarded as one of Coronation Street's greatest ever characters. Her final appearance came in January 1984, when Elsie emigrated to Portugal. Phoenix decided to quit the series in 1983 to pursue other projects. Three years after leaving, Phoenix died, and a few months later, in the video \\"The Lives and Loves of Elsie Tanner\\" Anne Cunningham returned as Elsie's daughter Linda, hinting about Elsie's previous passing and including archive footage for flashbacks. However, 24 years later, when Philip Lowrie returned as Elsie's son Dennis Tanner, it was revealed that Elsie had died in a car accident along with Bill Gregory in 2004/2005, meaning that the video is not part of the canon of the show (on which the events have not been mentioned). In 2011, it was revealed that she and her son Dennis were related to Eileen Grimshaw and Julie Carp as her cousin, Arnley Grimshaw, was their grandfather. Characterisation Elsie is dubbed as the \\"siren of the street throughout the 1960s\\". She is described as being feisty and bolshy, but with a good heart, and is also said to have a passion for men but get hurt by all of them. In her later years she is described as struggling to keep up her glamour and has a series of sleazy one-night stands and dead-end jobs. Storylines Elsie Tanner in 1961 At the beginning of the series, Elsie had two adult children, Linda (Anne Cunningham) and Dennis (Philip Lowrie), from her marriage to Arnold Tanner (Frank Crawshaw). Linda had trouble with her Polish husband Ivan Cheveski (Ernst Walder) and his short temper, but they eventually reconciled and had two sons, Paul (Victoria Elton, Marcus Saville and Nigel Greaves) and Martin (Jonathan Caplan). Coronation Street's creator, Tony Warren, had originally planned the character of Dennis to be rather gritty and a real \\"bad boy\\", but actor Philip Lowrie's charm and knack for comedy led to Dennis becoming much more lighthearted. Dennis was shown to be sneaky and up to shenanigans, and embarked on many \\"get rich quick\\" schemes to help himself and his mother. Elsie flirted on and off for years with Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), but that ended when he married Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) in 1977. Even after Len's marriage to Rita, she remained a close friend. Elsie married an ex-lover from the war, American serviceman Steve Tanner in 1967 (played by Canadian actor Paul Maxwell). Due to Elsie's massive popularity during the 1960s, Steve was given the same surname so that Elsie would not have to change her name. Elsie emigrated to America with Steve but returned to Coronation Street after they split up. Steve also returned, attempting to win her back, but was found dead at the bottom of a flight of stairs soon after his return. This led many residents to be in the frame for murdering Steve, but it was later revealed that one of Steve's former Servicemen, Joe Donelli (Shane Rimmer), had committed the crime. Now a widow, Elsie married Alan Howard in 1970 (Alan was played by Alan Browning, who would become Patricia Phoenix's real-life husband). This marriage was also rocky; shortly after they married, script-writers bankrupted affluent Alan so Elsie would stay in Weatherfield. Eventually, in 1973, the two went to live in Newcastle-upon-Tyne but Elsie returned alone in 1976 as she and Alan had separated and later got divorced. Elsie was also involved with bookie Dave Smith (Reginald Marsh) in the early 1970s, owner of local football team Weatherfield County FC. After her third failed marriage, Elsie surrounded herself with youngsters and acted as mother figure to Suzie Birchall (Cheryl Murray) and Gail Potter (Helen Worth), who lodged with her during the late 1970s. Elsie saw a lot of herself in young Suzie, who was somewhat gregarious and enjoyed the company of men, but it was Elsie's relationship with Gail that was inevitably the strongest. During her time, Elsie took a diverse range of jobs, including shop worker, croupier, machinist, factory supervisor, caf√© worker and model. At the start of the series, Elsie worked in the department store \\"Miami Modes\\", before moving on to \\"Sylvia's Separates\\" dress shop in the 1970s. She also worked under Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) alongside Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn), Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie) and Ida Clough (Helene Palmer) at Baldwin's Casuals clothing factory, where she spent some time as supervisor. In late 1983, Bill Gregory (Jack Watson) returned to the Street (she had an affair with him more than twenty years earlier and last saw him in 1970) and confessed to Elsie that he was still in love with her. He asked her to marry him and help him run a wine bar in Portugal. After much agonising and thought, she decided to accept Bill's proposal. On the night she left, Elsie walked down the street and old memories filled her head; squabbles with Annie Walker (Doris Speed) and Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) and fights with her son, Dennis. While clutching photographs of Linda and Dennis, she smiled knowing that her life in Coronation Street had left her with no regrets. As she got into the taxi that was to take her to the train station, the driver asked her if she was to be away for long. Giving him a knowing smile, Elsie replied: \\"Ah! Now there's a question!\\". The taxi drove off into the night as Elsie left Weatherfield forever. Reception In Dorothy Catherine Anger's book \\"Other worlds: society seen through soap opera\\" she brands Elsie a \\"tarty woman\\" who has the ability to \\"attract men like bees to honey\\". In Larry Warren's book \\"Left at East Gate a First Hand\\", he joked about the probability of UFO landing being \\"as unlikely as Elsie Tanner getting into a nunnery\\" and branded her as having dubious morals. In the book \\"Women and soap opera: a study of prime time soaps\\", Christine Geraghty describes Elsie as having open family situations to deal with in her later years. She stated that Elsie always seemed ill-equipped to offer other characters advice on their love lives when they needed it. Departure In 1983, it was announced that Phoenix would be leaving her role of Elsie and was to leave Weatherfield. Her final appearance was screened at the beginning of 1984. Phoenix died of lung cancer in September 1986 at the age of 62. Elsie, her character, died in a car accident, at the age of 81 in 2004 after leaving Weatherfield 20 years earlier, although it was not mentioned in the show until 2011.

The appellate court also noted that the defendant could have limited the quantity of the infringements if he had eliminated an encryption system feature and if it had monitored the use of its systems. This made it so that the defense did not fall within the safe harbor of 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(i).. and could not be used as an excuse to not know about the infringement. In addition, the court decided that the harm done to the plaintiff was irreparable and outweighed any harm to the defendant created by the injunction. Background Recording industry owners of copyrights in musical performances brought contributory and vicarious infringement action, a type of secondary liability, against a website operator called Aimster, a company similar to Napster which facilitated the swapping of digital copies of songs over the internet.ENotes Website at http://www.enotes.com/topic/In_re_Aimster_Copyright_Litigation Owners of copyrighted popular music claimed that John Deep (\\"Deep\\")'s Aimster Internet service was a contributory and vicarious infringer of these copyrights. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Marvin E. Aspen, Jr., granted preliminary injunction for plaintiffs, which shut down Defendant's service until the suit was resolved, Aimster appealed from this preliminary injunction to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The defendants argued that, unlike Napster, they designed their technology in such a way that they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. Someone who wanted to use Aimster's basic service for the first time to swap files had to download Aimster's software and then had to register on the system. After doing this he might designate any other registered user called a buddy, with whom he might communicate directly whenever both of them were online, and have the capability of interchanging music files. If the user did not designate any buddies, then all the users of the system became automatically his buddies to share files. Opinion The court held that in this case the users of the systems were the direct infringers, these who are ignorant or more commonly disdainful of copyright and in any event discount the likelihood of being sued or prosecuted for copyright infringement, however companies such as Aimster that facilitate their infringement, even if they are not themselves direct infringers can be liable for copyright violations as contributory infringers.Sony Revisited: A new look at contributory copyright infringement, Lee A. Hollaar, University of Utah, 2004 http://digital-law- online.info/papers/lah/sony-revisited-june6.pdf The court analyzed that the copyrighted materials might sometimes be shared between users of such a system without the authorization of the holder of the copyright owner and, in this case, fair-use privilege will not make the Aimster a contributory infringer. As mentioned in the Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,. also known as the Betamax case, the producer of a product which has substantial noninfringing uses is not a contributory infringer, merely because some of the uses actually made of the product are infringing. In that case, a video reproducer machine called Betamax, the predecessor of today's videocassette recorders was at the issue. The court explained about the sale of the Betamax that the ability of a service provider to prevent its customers from infringing is a factor to be considered in determining whether the provider is or not a contributory infringer. In re Aimster Copyright Litig., 252 F. Supp. 2d 634, Aimster, however, was not able to produce any evidence that its service had ever been used for a noninfringing purpose, instead the facts showed that Aimster encouraged these infringing activities.United States Supreme Court to Review Ninth Circuit Peer-to-Peer Decision http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2005/2/article37.en.html The court rejected Aimster's argument that to prevail the recording industry should prove that some actual loss of money has occurred because of the copying that Aimster service's contribute in producing. The court explained that although the court, in Betamax, emphasized that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had sustained substantial harm from Sony's video recorder, it did so in the context of assessing the argument that time shifting of television programs was fair use rather than infringement. The court believed that Betamax was not hurting the copyright owners because it was enlarging the audience for their programs, as well as advertisements. However it was also clear that even though without proving economic loss, compensation for damages can not be awarded, plaintiff could still obtain statutory damages and an injunction. The Court also rejected Aimster's argument that because the court said in Betamax that mere constructive knowledge of infringing uses is not enough for contributory infringement, 464 U.S. at 439, 104 S.Ct. 774, and the encryption feature of Aimster's service prevented Deep from knowing what songs were being copied by the users of his system, Aimster lacked the knowledge of infringing uses that liability for contributory infringement requires. The opinion also makes it clear that a service provider that fits within the characteristics of a contributory infringer does not obtain any sort of immunity by using encryption, to avoid knowledge of the unlawful purposes for which the service is being used. Actually, a tutorial for the Aimster software showed as its only examples of file sharing the sharing of copyrighted works, including copyrighted music that plaintiffs. This fact had implied Aimster continued to be affected by Aimster's users. In this sense the tutorial was nothing but an invitation to infringe this copyrighted music, same invitation that the Supreme Court found could not find in the Sony case. Willful blindness is knowledge, in copyright law (where indeed it may be enough that the defendant should have known of the direct infringement, see Casella v. Morris), as it is in the law generally. Another example is Louis Vuitton S.A. v. Lee, 875 F.2d 584, 590 (7th Cir. 1989) (contributory trademark infringement). The doctrine of willful blindness is established in many criminal statutes, which require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or willfully. Courts have held that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately shielding themselves, from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances, understanding that those who behave in such manner should be treated as those who had actual knowledge. Lastly, the court established that the DMCA ¬ß 512 \\"safe harbors\\" were unavailable because Aimster had done nothing to comply reasonably with Section 512(i)'s requirement to establish a policy to terminate repeat infringers and instead even encouraged repeat infringement. Opinion of the Judge The opinion was written by Judge Richard Posner, known for his publications on law and economics, and followed closely on the heels of the Ninth Circuit's decision in A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.Richard Posner's Profile at University of Chicago Law School Conclusion The decision of the District Court was affirmed, concluding that a preliminary injunction against the file-sharing service was appropriate.

They were first established in 2004 as an expansion team named for their owner's business ventures. James Galante purchased the franchising rights for $500,000 and named his 17-year-old son, A. J., president and general manager. As part of the franchising agreement, Galante invested an additional $1.5 million to upgrade the team's home arena, Danbury Ice Arena, from a 750-seat facility to a 3,000-seat venue. In their first season, the Trashers set a league record for penalty minutes. The season witnessed two separate brawls and multiple player suspensions. Danbury finished second in their division and were eliminated in the playoffs by eventual Colonial Cup champions, the Muskegon Fury. In their second year, the Trashers won the Eastern Division and reached the finals. Though they lost the championship, Danbury handed the Kalamazoo Wings their only loss of the playoffs. At the end of the team's second season, Galante was arrested on 72 various charges including conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 87 months of imprisonment, and had to forfeit his ownership interests in 25 trash hauling companies. During the same time the Trashers disbanded, citing financial concerns, including travel costs.  History = Founding  The Danbury Trashers were founded as an expansion team in the United Hockey League (UHL) on April 1, 2004, by James Galante, a garbage disposal mogul, who paid a $500,000 franchise fee to the league. Galante had considered investing in the New Haven Knights prior to the franchise folding. He purchased the franchising rights after seeing the enthusiasm for hockey in Danbury at his son A. J.'s high school games. He also wanted to give A. J. experience in how to manage a professional sports franchise, naming him president and General Manager. A. J. was a 17-year-old high school student at the time and according to UHL commissioner Richard Brosal some around the league thought it was an April Fools' Day joke. After graduating high school Galante attended Manhattanville College while maintaining his organizational duties. The new team was named the Trashers, a reference to the elder Galante's main business, with the logo being designed by A. J.'s friends. The Trashers were to play in the Danbury Ice Arena, a 750-seat ice rink, used for the local hockey leagues. As part of the franchising agreement the arena needed the maximum capacity expanded. Galante invested an additional $1.5 million to renovate the arena, turning it into a 3,000 seat facility. Galante envisioned a physical team with a \\"bad-boy image\\" and to become the \\"Evil Empire of the UHL\\". To that end he brought in tough guys, Garrett Burnett, Rumun Ndur, and Brad Wingfield, who previously set a UHL record for penalty minutes (PIMs) during the 2002‚Äì03 season with 576. He also brought in skill players such as, Jim Duhart, who led the UHL in scoring the previous season, former National Hockey League (NHL) player Brent Gretzky, and Michael Rupp, who played for the team during the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout. For the goaltender Galante acquired Scott Stirling, who was the Most Valuable Player of the ECHL the previous season. As for the coaches, Todd Stirling, son of former New York Islanders head coach Steve Stirling and brother of Scott, was named head coach. A. J.'s former high school head coach was hired as an assistant coach. After the team had been assembled The Hockey News picked the Trashers to finish second in the league.  UHL seasons (2004‚Äì2006)  The Trashers first season began with the team playing around .500 hockey. Then a quarter of the way through the 2004‚Äì05 season they went on a seven-game unbeaten streak that moved them into first place in the Eastern Division. The streak was part of nine consecutive games without a regulation loss. This lifted the Trashers into a tie for first place in the league. The winning streak was also witness to one of two brawls during the season. In a game against the Kalamazoo Wings on December 1, Wingfield attempted to instigate a fight after an altercation with a Wings' player. The player refused to fight, but as Wingfield skated away the player grabbed Wingfield's jersey and pulled him back over an outstretched leg. Wingfield's skate caught on the ice as he fell backwards breaking his ankle. The play incited a brawl, where Ndur fought with two players, attempted to kick a linesman, and charged the Wings bench, before the officials were able to subdue him. His actions led to a 20-game suspension by the league, while the Kalamazoo player received 5 games. Upset with the officiating James Galante went down to ice level to voice his opinion. Galante entered the ice via the penalty box where he got into a shouting match with a linesman and allegedly punched him. For his actions Galante was charged with misdemeanor assault and fined by the UHL for leaving the owner's box. The UHL stated that because of the disturbances on the ice they could not determine what actually happened. The linesman was suspended for five games for his part in the altercation. He later asked that the assault charges against Galante be dropped. After this request prosecutors still intended to pursue the charges, but eventually dropped them citing lack of evidence. After the brawl the Trashers went 8‚Äì2‚Äì0 in their next 10 games. A second brawl occurred months later in a game versus the Adirondack Frostbite. At the end of the brawl, the Trashers' Chad Wagner was being removed from the ice by the linesmen when he broke away, and attacked the Adirondack bench, grabbing their head coach. Compounding the issue two other Trashers' players left the penalty box and skated towards the bench. A third player sucker punched an opponent, breaking his nose. For his part in the brawl, Wagner was banned from the UHL while the two players, who left the penalty box, received 5 and 10 game suspensions respectively, and the third player was suspended for the remainder of the season and playoffs. Head coach Stirling was also suspended three games for not being able to control his players. It was the sixteenth time the league had suspended a Trashers player. Danbury again found success after the brawl going 8‚Äì3‚Äì0 in their next 11 games. On February 23, 2005, the Trashers again hosted the Adirondack Frostbite. World Wrestling Entertainment superstar John Cena was on hand for what resembled more of a WWE event than a hockey game. The teams combined for 106 penalty minutes in the first period and 6 game-misconducts were issued in the first 10 minutes of the game. The Danbury Trashers would go on to win the game 4-2.https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trashers-fight-past- Frostbite-243302.php The Trashers struggled towards the end of the season having both a four and three game losing streak and posting a 2‚Äì6‚Äì2 record. Danbury finished the regular season with 95 points, second place in the Eastern Division, 9 points behind Adirondack. They also set a UHL record PIMs at 2,776. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the Frostbite, winning the series four games to two. In the second round Danbury faced the Muskegon Fury who led the Central division with 111 points. The Trashers were eliminated 4‚Äì1, by Muskegon who went on to win the league championship, the Colonial Cup. At season's end the Trashers were announced the winners of the UHL's Merchandiser of the Year Award. In the off-season the Trashers changed head coaches, bringing in Paul Gillis, who had coached the Quad City Mallards the previous season. Stirling remained with the team in a scouting and consulting role. They also brought in a new goaltender, Sylvain Daigle, who had won three Colonial Cups with the Fury. Daigle was taken by the Port Huron Flags in an expansion draft and traded to Danbury for their top goal scorer Mike Bayrack. They also reached an agreement to have all of their games broadcast on local ESPN Radio affiliated stations and to have select games broadcast on tape delay locally on Comcast Cable. The Trashers began the season with two shootout games, winning one and losing the other. Despite earning three out of a possible four points, Gillis was unhappy with the team's performance. His concerns were later proved accurate as Danbury started the year with a 4‚Äì5‚Äì2 record. The Trashers hovered around the .500 mark going into December where they started the month with a six-game win streak that brought them within five points of first place in Eastern Division. They finished December without a regulation loss going 11‚Äì0‚Äì3. Danbury finished the season strong with a seven-game win streak in March and finished the year on a six-game win streak. The winning steaks helped Danbury win the Eastern Division finishing with 107 points, nine ahead of Adirondack. In the first round the Trashers faced off against Gillis former team, the Mallards. Although the Trashers began the playoffs as the second seed, they had lost both regular season match-ups with the Mallards. Danbury lost the first two games of the seven game series at home and were facing games 3‚Äì5 on the road. The Trashers won games three and four to tie the series before losing game five. Facing elimination Danbury won the final two games to win the series 4‚Äì2 and advance to the second round. The second round was a rematch with Muskegon. The Trashers took a 3‚Äì2 series lead into game 6, which went to triple-overtime before Danbury finally eliminated the defending champions. In the finals the Trashers faced the Kalamazoo Wings, who had not lost a game in the playoffs. Danbury lost game one of the series, but rebounded to defeat the K-wings in game two. It proved to be the only game that the K-Wings lost that year as they won the next three games to capture the championship. During the finals Daigle set a UHL record for most saves in a single playoff year with 511. Controversy and end of the Trashers In June 2006, James Galante was charged with 72 various charges including racketeering. One of the charges that pertained directly to the Trashers was wire fraud, which resulted from the interstate faxing of fraudulent salary cap documents. The Trashers had circumvent the UHLs $275,000 annual salary cap, by giving players or their wives no-show positions within one of the disposal companies or giving them housing allowance checks for sums which had already been paid. Estimates were that the Trashers had exceeded the salary cap by $475,000 making the total payroll closer to $750,000. For his part in aiding with violating the salary cap former head coach Stirling was also charged with wire fraud. He pleaded guilty and was given five years of probation. Galante pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), one count of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, and one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud. He was sentenced to 87 months of imprisonment, had to forfeit his ownership interests in 25 trash hauling companies, a Southbury residence, six racing cars, a trailer used to haul them, and $448,153.10 in cash seized from his business office and home. Amid the controversy the Trashers disbanded. Adirondack failed to secure an arena lease and disbanded, with their closest geographical competitor gone, Danbury folded over financial concerns, including travel costs. The players from both Danbury and Adirondack were placed into a dispersal draft and selected by the remaining teams in the UHL. The team was replaced by the New England Stars, of the North Eastern Hockey League in 2006.

In most countries where honours degrees are granted, they imply a higher level of achievement than a non-honours degree. In some countries (e.g. Australia), an honours degree may also involve a longer period of study than a non-honours degree. Students who complete all the requirements for a non-honours bachelor's degree but do not receive sufficient merit to be awarded an honours degree would normally be awarded a non-honours degree (sometimes known as a \\"pass\\", \\"general\\" or \\"ordinary\\" degree), although students who do not complete the requirements for an integrated master's honours degree may receive a bachelor's honours degree. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, almost all bachelor's degrees are awarded as honours degrees; in contrast, honours degrees are rarely awarded in the United States. The current British undergraduate degree classification system, with its division into first, upper and lower second, and third class honours, was developed in 1918 to distinguish between students on the basis of their academic achievement. The concept of an \\"honours\\" degree goes back a lot further than this, however, with there being examinations for honours in the original regulations of the University of London in 1839, and Nevil Maskelyne being recorded as taking a bachelor's degree with honours at Cambridge in 1754. Other countries influenced by this system include Australia, Brunei, Canada, New Zealand, Malta, Singapore, South Africa and Hong Kong. Australia The consecutive Australian with-honours degree is usually a one to two-year research program, after the completion of a bachelor's degree in the same field. It can also be started as a concurrent program in the fourth year of a four-year bachelor's degree. It is generally considered a postgraduate year because a bachelor's degree can be completed without it. Entry to an honours degree generally requires proven abilities and a distinction (75% or greater average) in the relevant area or the final-year units, and even then is quite competitive. In the regular (standalone) honours, the student will complete selected courses within a supervised program of research (field, laboratory, or secondary), and produce a long, high-quality research thesis. This is usually accompanied by a seminar or presentation of the findings to an academic board for marking. In the case of a quality thesis being produced, its findings may be published in a peer- reviewed academic journal or similar publication. Students receiving high marks in their honours program have the option of continuing to candidature of a doctoral program, such as Doctor of Philosophy, without having to complete a master's degree. Honours can be awarded at up to five levels, depending on the awarding institution, and may be indicated in post-nominals in general as \\"(Hons)\\": * Honours, Class 1, with a University Medal, sometimes indicated in post-nominals as (Hons IM), (Hons 1M), or (H1M) * Honours, Class 1, sometimes indicated in post-nominals as (Hons I), (Hons 1), or (H1) * Honours, Class 2, Division 1, sometimes indicated in post-nominals as (Hons II), (Hons II(1)), (Hons 2(1)), or (H21) * Honours, Class 2, Division 2, sometimes indicated in post-nominals as (Hons II), (Hons II(2)), (Hons 2(2)), or (H22) * Honours, Class 3, sometimes indicated in post-nominals as (Hons III), (Hons 3), or (H3) At the master's level, Monash University has a Master of Business with Honours program in which students can be awarded an honours classification upon completion. Canada In Canada there are two type of honours degree. Some universities, especially in Ontario, award honours after four years of undergraduate study, instead of the three years of a 'general' bachelor's degree. Examples include Queen's University and York University. In those universities, honours students may undertake an honours thesis. Some other universities, such as Mcgill University, University of Ottawa, Western University, University of British Columbia, Concordia University and Dalhousie University, require students to undertake an honours project in order to graduate with honours (Latin cum honore, French sp√©cialis√©). In those universities, honours programmes also require a higher degree of specialization than non-honours 'major' degrees, including a supervised research project or thesis, and students are required to maintain a high academic standard. Thesis-based honours degrees prepare students for research- based postgraduate study, and may sometimes allow direct entry into doctoral programs. A four-year bachelor's degree is required for entry to most postgraduate courses in Canada.ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Dalhousie University England, Wales and Northern Ireland In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, bachelor's degrees are normally awarded \\"with honours\\" after three years of study. The bachelor's degree with honours meets the requirements for a higher education qualification at level 6 of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications in full, and is a first-cycle, end-of-cycle award on the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area established by the Bologna process. Students can be awarded an \\"ordinary\\" degree if they achieve the required learning outcomes over a smaller volume of studies than is required for an honours degree, e.g. only passing 300 credits rather than the 360 usually required for an honours degree. In addition to bachelor's degrees, four-year integrated master's degrees, which combine study at the bachelor's and master's levels, are also awarded with honours. The University of Oxford does not award honours with its standard BA degree, but considers students who gain a third class degree or better to have \\"achieved honours status\\". Hong Kong Universities in Hong Kong have four degree classifications: first class, second class upper division (or second class division one/I), second class lower division (or second class division two/II), and third class. Bachelor degrees issued in Hong Kong are honour degrees and are abbreviated as B.Sc. (Hons), B.Eng, (Hons), etc. The University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology follow a GPA scale of 4.3, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong follows a GPA scale of 4.0. Malta A number of honours degrees are offered by the University of Malta, and the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST), usually indicating an extra year of study with an undergraduate dissertation or a specialisation within a three-year programme. New Zealand The bachelor honours degree is a separate level on the New Zealand Qualifications Framework from the bachelor's degree without honours, as in Australia and Scotland. It may either be a 4-year (480 credit) course or a single-year (120 credit) course following on from a bachelor's degree, and it prepares students for postgraduate study. Scotland In Scotland, all undergraduate degrees with honours must be of four-year duration. Students can choose to do the honours degree or the general (or pass/ordinary) degree. The first two years of both types of degrees are the same; however, after that, students who pursue the honours route will complete more advanced subjects and a dissertation in their last year, while students who choose to do the general degree will complete their third year at a lower level of specialisation. Entry into the honours year in Scotland is generally not restricted and students are encouraged to take the honours year as the general/ordinary/pass degree does not provide the same level of depth and specialisation. Students enrolling in the honours program but failing to achieve the required academic merit for honours are awarded a pass/ordinary/general degree. Ireland In Ireland, honours bachelor's degrees are at level 8 of the National Framework of Qualifications and are Bologna first cycle degrees. They normally follow a three or four year (180-240 ECTS credits) course. The higher diploma may be awarded at the same level following a single year of study (60 ECTS credits) and is normally taken following an honours degree as a conversion course. Ordinary (non-honours) bachelor's degrees are at level 7 of the framework and take three years (180 EFTS credits) to complete. South Africa In South Africa, non-professional bachelor's degrees (BA, BSc, BCom) are three-year degrees (professional degrees such as engineering degrees or medicine are longer). The honours degree is an optional fourth year and is an additional one-year qualification. Usually the honours degree specialises in one subject matter (e.g., mathematics, English). Intake into the honours degree is often highly selective. The bachelor's degree is at level 7 and the honours degree at level 8 on the National Qualifications Framework of the South African Qualifications Authority. Research components must comprise at least 25% of the honours degree. United States In the United States, an honours degree (or honors degree in US spelling) requires a thesis or project work beyond that needed for the normal bachelor's program. Honours programs in the US are taken alongside the rest of the degree and often have a minimum GPA requirement for entry, which can vary between institutions. Some institutions do not have a separate honours program, but instead refer to bachelor's degrees awarded with Latin honours, which may be based either on GPA or class position, as honours degrees.

It is the sole genus of the subtribe Acalyphinae. It is one of the largest euphorb genera, with approximately 450 to 462 species. The genus name Acalypha is from the Ancient Greek () (\\"nettle\\"), an alternative form of (), and was inspired by the nettle-like leaves. General common names include copperleaf and three-seeded mercury. Native North American species are generally inconspicuous most of the year until the fall when their stems and foliage turn a distinctive coppery-red. The genus is distributed mainly in the tropics and subtropics, with about 60% of species native to the Americas and about 30% in Africa. Description The genus includes annuals or perennial herbs, shrubs, and small trees. Most are monoecious, and some are dioecious. Indumentum of simple hair or glands, rarely of stellate hair. The leaves are alternately arranged, undivided, generally petiolate, stipulate; stipels rarely present at apex of petiole or leaf base, caduceus. The blades entire or more frequently dentate or crenate, pinnately or palmately veined. There are several types of inflorescence, terminal or axillary, frequently both, unisexual or androgynous. Male inflorescences spicate, densely flowered, with several flowers at each node subtended by a minute bract. Female inflorescences generally spicate, sometimes racemose or panicle-shaped, with 1‚Äì3(‚Äì5) flowers at each node, usually subtended by a large bract, increasing and foliaceous in the fruit, generally dentate or lobed; sometimes subtended by a small bract, entire or lobed, non accrescent in the fruit. Androgynous inflorescences usually with female flowers at proximal nodes and male flower at distal nodes. Flowers unisexual, apetalous, disc absent. Male flowers very small, shortly pedicellate, globose in bud; calyx parted into 4 small valvate sepals; stamens 4‚Äì8(‚Äì16) on a slightly raised receptacle, filaments free or basally connate; anthers with divaricate or pendulous thecae, unilocular, more or less elongated and later becoming vermiform; pollen grains oblate-spheroidal, with 3‚Äì5 pseudopores, tectate, psilate; pistillode absent. Female flowers generally sessile or subsessile, pedicellate in a few species; calyx of 3‚Äì (4‚Äì5) small sepals imbricate, connate at base; ovary of [1‚Äì2]3 carpels, surface often muricate, pubescent or papillose; ovules solitary in each cell, anatropes; styles reddish, free or basally connate, several times divided into filiform segment, rarely bifid or entire; staminodes absent. Fruits capsular, small, 3-lobed, soon dehiscing septicidally into 3 bivalved cocci; generally surrounded by the accrescent female bract. Seeds small, ovoid or ellipsoid, usually carunculate, smooth or foveolate; endosperm present, whitish; the embryo straight; cotyledons broad and flat. Allomorphic female flowers present in some species, generally terminal (sometimes median or basal) in the inflorescences; ebracteate, long pedicellate or subsessile; calyx as in the normal female flowers; ovary and fruits 1-2 locular. Taxonomy The genus Acalypha was described in the Species Plantarum by Linn√© (1753), as belonging to the monoecia monadelphia class along with other Euphorbiaceae genera such as Croton, Jatropha and Ricinus. Previously it was also included in the Corollarium Generum Plantarum (Linn√©, 1737). Its definition has been changed very little ever since, and it is confirmed as a natural and well specified genus. In its Species Plantarum, Linn√© sets forth the first three binominal names, i.e. A. virginica from North America, and A. indica and A. australis from Asia; in 1760 he describes a fourth species: A. virgata from Jamaica. In the same year, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin, as a result from his journey to Caribbean Sea, writes Enumeratio Systematica Plantarum, in which species A. villosa and A. carthagenensis from Colombia, and A. corensis from Venezuela are described. The first Acalypha iconographies are also shown in the books by Jacquin; there coloured sheets of A. villosa (Jacquin, 1776), A. alopecuroides (Jacquin, 1792), A. cuspidata, A. diversifolia and A. macrostachya (Jacquin, 1797) can be found. Until the late 18th century the outstanding incorporations to the genus were those from Pehr Forssk√•l, a Linn√© student, who sets forth six new species in his Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica in 1775; and also those from Swedish botanist Olof Swartz, author of Nova Genera et Species Plantarum seu Prodromus, in 1788, where eight new species are published as a result of a journey around Western Indies. In 1789 Antoine de Jussieu also incorporates Acalypha in his Genera Plantarum. 19th century going on, Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles describes six species from Mexico: these were collected by Luis N√©e, a botanist from Malaspina Expedition (Cavanilles, 1800). One year later, such species are again included in his book Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum together with some excellent monochrome drawings. In 1804 and 1816, Jean Louis Marie Poiret makes the first compilation of all Acalypha known species in the Encyclop√©die M√©thodique, Botanique by Jean Baptiste Lamarck (vol. VI and suppl. IV). There he describes forty species, thirteen of them for the first time. In 1805, Carl Ludwig Willdenow compiles and describes thirty nine Acalypha species in his Species Plantarum, in which the first classification of genus is made. The species are grouped as to whether they are monoecious or dioecious, and to the position of flowers and inflorescences. As an offspring from the American journey made by Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland, twelve new Acalypha species, from Mexico and Colombia, are described by Sigmund Kunth in Nova Genera et Species Plantarum (1817, 1825). In 1826, Kurt Sprengel compiles fifty eighth Acalypha species in his Systema Vegetabilium, seven of them brand new. He puts them together under a key with characters similar to those used by Willdenow, finally, the herbaceous species are separated from the woody species. During the first half of the 19th century, many new species are published all around the world, with emphasis on the works by Eduard Poeppig (1841) and George Bentham (1839, 1844) about American species. In the French botanist Henri Baillon publication √âtude g√©n√©rale du groupe des Euphorbiac√©es (1858), a large morphological description of genus is made, and a peculiar classification is presented: two sections are considered ‚Äì‚ÄúSect. A‚Äù and ‚ÄúSect. B‚Äù‚Äì depending on whether the inflorescence axis is simple or branched out, and the female flowers calyx consists of three or five sepals. Baillon continued to publish a series of works under the title Euphorbiac√©es am√©ricaines, to be issued in the first volumes of Adansonia journal, between 1860 and 1864. More than fifty new species of Acalypha are described thereto, most of them from South America, and specially from Brazil. Johannes M√ºller Argoviensis, a Swiss botanist specialist in lichens and director of Geneva herbarium, was entrusted with making a good many Euphorbiaceae, Acalyphagenus included, ready for De Candolle‚Äôs Prodromus (M√ºller Argoviensis, 1866). As a preparation for that public book, he published in Flora journal a lot of descriptions of new species based on specimens of Hooker herbarium, at Kew Gardens (M√ºller Argoviensis, 1864). In such a work, M√ºller for the first time uses a classification of Acalypha in two sections, i. e. ‚ÄúLinostachys‚Äù and ‚ÄúEuacalypha‚Äù, names which accompany each of the described species. In 1865, he publishes in Linnaea journal a first revision of genus, in which 164 species are gathered ‚Äì67 of them first time described‚Äì and Acalypha is formally divided into two sections as above referred. The Linostachys section is based on the homonymous genus from Klotzsch (1846), and includes seven species with pedicellate male flowers and bracts non-increasing in the fruit. The Euacalypha section incorporates all 157 remaining species, which have sessile female flowers and bracts increasing in the fruit. This latter section is in turn divided into ‚Äúseries‚Äù, ‚Äúsubseries‚Äù, and finally in groups designated by the symbol ‚Äú¬ß‚Äù, mainly according to the relative positions of male and female flowers in inflorescences and depending on whether these are axillary or terminal, unisexual or bisexual. Finally, in De Candolle‚Äôs Prodromus (M√ºller Argoviensis, 1866) 30 new species are described, thus raising up to 215 the number of accepted species, which are ordered as per such a complex infrasectional classification. Nearly all names of subgeneric taxa from M√ºller are illegitimate according to the current rules of International Code of Botanic Nomenclature. M√ºller Argoviensis was also entrusted with the preparation of Acalypha for the Flora Brasiliensis of Martius (M√ºller Argoviensis, 1874), in which 10 new species are described. There he maintains his two sections, but he does not use the infrasectional classification. From 1867 to 1923 no new proposal is made concerning the classification of the high number of species which genus already consists of. This is, however, a plentiful period in discovery and description of new species: ca. 220 are published. We must highlight the work from John Hutchinson (1913) for Flora of Tropical Africa by Thiselton-Dyer, where he is dealing with 42 species in modern flower format and, for the first time, he introduces a dichotomous identification key. In 1894 Ferdinand Pax, one of the most productive collaborators in the Engler German school, publishes 12 new African species of Acalypha. Pax, and the German botanist K√§te Hoffmann, were entrusted with preparing the genus for the enormous Das Pflanzenreich, where all species known in the world so far are gathered and ordered (Pax & Hoffmann, 1924). They deem ca. 390 species as valid ones, of which 81 are first time described. Such a work is considered, even now, as the most complete revision of genus worldwide, and the necessary reference point for any taxonomic or local flora study. The infrageneric classification presented by Pax & Hoffmann is based on that from M√ºller Argoviensis, except in the rank of subgeneric taxa. Moreover, they use series and section categories in an opposite way to Muller‚Äôs: the series are described as higher ranked than sections are. So they divide Acalypha into three subgenera: Linostachys, Androcephala and Euacalypha. The subgenus Androcephala, single-typed, includes a species from Madagascar with pedicellate female flowers and capituliform male inflorescences. They divide subgenus Linostachys into three sections, and subgenus Euacalypha into 8 series and 39 sections. Pax & Hoffmann consider as ‚Äúsections‚Äù the lower category groups, which M√ºller designates by the symbol ¬ß. According to Grady Webster (1967), such ‚Äúsections‚Äù from Pax & Hoffmann are comparable to subsections or series in other Euphorbiaceae genera. The last input on Acalypha from Pax & Hoffmann is published in Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien by Engler & Prantl (Pax & Hoffmann 1931). It is just a synthesis of the treatment given in Das Pflanzenreich, where all species are classified and listed without any description or key. In a general paper on Euphorbiaceae systematics, Isao Hurusawa (1954) sets forth a new classification, where the rank of infrageneric taxa is even raised and a proposal is made to divide Acalypha into seven subgenera with 19 sections. Grady Webster (1967), in a study of Euphorbiaceae genera from Southeastern USA, deems inadequate the treatments given by Pax & Hoffmann and Hurusawa; he thinks that by dividing genus into two sections with many infrasectional taxa, such as presented by M√ºller, the grade of kinship between Acalypha species seems to be better outlined. Accordingly, Webster compiles Acalypha species from the United States into ten series, which are based on corresponding ‚Äú¬ß‚Äù groups from M√ºller. Uses A. hispida, the chenille plant or red-hot cat's tail, is cultivated as a houseplant for its interesting flowers. It earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, as has A. hispaniolae, the Hispaniola cat's tail. Others are grown for their foliage and a number of cultivars have been developed, such as A. wilkesiana 'Obovata Cristata' and A. wilkesiana 'Hoffmannii'. A. bipartita is eaten as a vegetable in some parts of Africa, and it is used in basketry and as animal fodder.

The highway runs from MacArthur Boulevard in Carderock, Maryland, east to Canal Road at the Chain Bridge in Washington. Clara Barton Parkway is a two- to four-lane parkway that parallels the Potomac River in southwestern Montgomery County, Maryland, and the far western corner of Washington. The parkway provides access to the communities of Cabin John and Glen Echo and several units of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The Maryland portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was constructed from Carderock past Interstate 495 (I-495) to Glen Echo in the early to mid-1960s. The parkway was proposed to continue west to Great Falls and east to Georgetown. However, these proposals never came to fruition and the parkway was extended only to the Chain Bridge in the early 1970s. The Maryland portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was renamed for Clara Barton, the founder of the American Red Cross, in 1989. Route description View northwest at the southeast end of the parkway Clara Barton Parkway begins at an intersection with MacArthur Boulevard in Carderock. MacArthur Boulevard heads west toward Great Falls and the affluent community of Potomac. Clara Barton Parkway heads east as a two-lane highway that expands to a four-lane divided highway ahead of its diamond interchange with an access road to the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center to the north, which features the David Taylor Model Basin, and Carderock Recreation Area of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O;) Canal to the south. East of the naval lab, the two roadways split for the parkway's six- ramp interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway). There is no direct access from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound I-495 or from southbound I-495 to the eastbound parkway. The parkway roadways come together in Cabin John just west of parking areas accessible from the eastbound direction to C&O; Canal Lock 10 and C&O; Canal Lock 8 and River Center. Access to Cabin John is provided by a diamond interchange to a road connecting the parkway with MacArthur Boulevard in that community. Clara Barton Parkway reduces to one lane eastbound as it crosses Cabin John Creek and meets Cabin John Parkway at a partial interchange featuring ramps from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound Cabin John Parkway and from Cabin John Parkway to eastbound Clara Barton Parkway, which becomes two lanes again. The parkway continues east to its final interchange, which provides access to MacArthur Boulevard in Glen Echo, the location of Glen Echo Park and Clara Barton National Historic Site. The interchange features a U-turn ramp from the eastbound direction to the westbound lanes of the parkway, a tight right-turn ramp from the access road to westbound Clara Barton Parkway, and an unused bridge over the westbound direction. There is no access from MacArthur Boulevard to the eastbound parkway. East of Glen Echo, Clara Barton Parkway reduces to a two-lane undivided highway that closely parallels MacArthur Boulevard on the hillside to the north. The parkway passes a pair of parking areas for Little Falls before temporarily expanding to a four-lane divided highway while passing a third parking area for C&O; Canal Lock 6. Clara Barton Parkway crosses Little Falls Branch and enters the District of Columbia before reaching its eastern terminus at an intersection with Canal Road and Chain Bridge Road. Canal Road heads east toward Georgetown while Chain Bridge Road crosses the Chain Bridge into Arlington, Virginia to connect with Virginia State Routes 120 and 123. Commercial vehicles, including trucks, are prohibited from Clara Barton Parkway without a permit from the National Park Service, which maintains the highway. Speed limits on the parkway are from the western terminus to the Carderock interchange, from the Carderock interchange to the Glen Echo interchange, and from the Glen Echo interchange to the Chain Bridge. Clara Barton Parkway operates as a one-way road between the Glen Echo interchange and its eastern terminus at the Chain Bridge Monday to Friday. Traffic flows eastbound only toward Washington from 6:15 a.m. to 10 a.m. and westbound only toward Glen Echo from 2:45 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. Clara Barton Parkway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. History Clara Barton Parkway looking west from the Carderock interchange Congress approved the construction of parkways on both sides of the Potomac River from Great Falls to Fort Washington and Mount Vernon in Maryland and Virginia, respectively, in 1930. Construction on what was originally named the George Washington Memorial Parkway on the Maryland side of the Potomac River was underway by 1961. The parkway was completed from its western end at MacArthur Boulevard to the interchange with Cabin John Parkway, which was not yet completed, in 1964. In 1965, the parkway opened from Cabin John east to the Glen Echo interchange. Extensions of the George Washington Memorial Parkway were proposed in both directions. From the west end, the parkway was to extend to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park site at Great Falls. Going east, the parkway would continue to Georgetown, where it would tie into the western end of the Whitehurst Freeway at its junction with the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The unused bridge at the Glen Echo interchange was constructed and preliminary infrastructure work was done east of the interchange in anticipation of constructing a second carriageway east toward Georgetown. The plans to extend the parkway to Great Falls and Georgetown were abandoned by 1969. The parkway was completed in its present form from the Glen Echo interchange to the Chain Bridge in 1973. Maryland's version of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was renamed for Clara Barton in 1989.

Infanteriedivision\\") ‚Äì later known as the 12th Volksgrenadier Division ‚Äì was a Wehrmacht military unit of Nazi Germany that fought during World War II. The division was formed in 1934. It participated in the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the 1940 campaign in France and the Low Countries. In the Soviet Union, the division joined Operation Barbarossa. The division was destroyed in the Soviet Operation Bagration in the summer of 1944. The division was re-activated in September 1944 and posted to the newly created Western Front. History and organisation=Formation The division was formed in 1934 from Pomerania's Mecklenburger population, with its home station being in Schwerin. In order to hide Germany's remilitarisation ‚Äì a breaking of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles ‚Äì the unit was codenamed Infanterief√ºhrer II to disguise its size. It did not assume its bona-fide designation until the creation of the Wehrmacht was announced in October 1935, where it was redesignated as the 12th Infantry Division. Alongside the name change, Lieutenant General Wilhelm Ulex was placed in charge of the division, before being replaced by Major General Albrecht Schubert the following October. Schubert was promoted to Lieutenant General in March 1938. In November, the command over the 89th Infantry Regiment's 1st Battalion was given to Helmuth Beukemann. In July 1939, the division was moved to Koenigsburg, East Prussia as Germany prepared for the upcoming invasion of Poland, ordered into the 1st Army's I Army Corps. Actions 1939‚Äì41 The 12th Infantry took part in the invasion of Poland. During the 1940 assault on France and the Low Countries, the division helped beat back an Anglo-French assault on an associated Panzer column in the hopes of relieving troops besieged in Belgium during their full-on retreat. Following the campaign, the division remained stationed in the region until May 1941 in an occupational capacity, when it was ordered to return to East Prussia. Actions in the Soviet Union Offensive of the Red Army south of Lake Ilmen 7 January‚Äì21 February 1942. In June 1941 the division joined Operation Barbarossa under Army Group North as an element of the 16th Army. It took part in Army Group North's capture of the Latvian city of Daugavpils, sweeping north-eastward to Leningrad where it was finally stopped in its tracks during the siege effort. During the early months of 1942, the II Army Corps was subject to a Soviet counteroffensive to relieve Leningrad, resulting in five army divisions (the 12th, included) and the SS-Totenkopf division being encircled along with several other elements of the 16th Army in the Demyansk Pocket. With support from Hermann G√∂ring, planes containing supplies were flown in to aid the divisions while they were in the pocket for some 81 days between 8 February and 20 March. G√∂ring would later gloat about his success in freeing the pocket during the Battle of Stalingrad later that year, when a similar airlift concept was applied. While liberated, the 12th Infantry had left the pocket in a much-weakened state. In 1943, with the German Army on the retreat, the division fought in the Belarussian city of Vitebsk. This resulting deterioration of effectiveness led to its capitulation during the Soviets' Summer Offensive in July 1944, soon after Army Group Centre's collapse in Operation Bagration. None of the division's men escaped capture; its commanding officer Lieutenant General Rudolf Bamler, who had been in command for only a few weeks, was also captured, but later chose to work for the Soviets. Re-activation The division was re-activated in September 1944, where it was sent to the newly created Western Front. Again placed under the command of Colonel Gerhard Engel, the division ‚Äì at some point being redesignated the \\"12th Volksgrenadier Division\\" (German: 12. Volksgrenadier- division) ‚Äì was at a strength of some 12,800 men. With Allied forces approaching the Siegfried Line, the division was made a line division against the Siegfried Line near Aachen. On September 15, elements of the division arrived at the command post of LXXXI Corps where; in the evening they were given orders by the 7th Army to continue the defence of Aachen and to launch a counterattack on the building Allied forces crossing the Ruhr, by first staging near Eschweiler. The following day, elements of the 9th Panzer Division were added to the 12th Volksgrenadier, which was now well-equipped ‚Äì at least in comparison to other, starving divisions. It then proceeded to take command of the immediate area around D√ºren. A meeting between chiefs of staff of the 12th Volksgrenadier and the 9th Panzer Divisions took place on the evening to decide on how to plan their joint-attack on the river Mausbach set for the following day. The division later saw action in the Western Front in the Ardennes as part of the 6th Panzer Army's I SS-Panzer Corps, where it took part in the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest. On January 1, Lieutenant General Engel was seriously wounded by Allied forces, and Colonel Rudolf Langhaeuser assumed temporary command until Engel's return in February. When the offensive failed, the 6th Panzer Army left for Hungary, leaving the division behind to fight off the approaching Americans. The division was encircled near Wuppertal with Army Group B within the Ruhr Pocket. On April 12, Major General Koenig assumed command of the division, having also assumed command of the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division. As the Pocket collapsed, Koenig was captured at Wuppertal on April 18.

As the 20th Motorized Infantry Division the unit took part in the invasion of Poland as part of Heinz Guderian's XIX Corps. During that campaign the motorized divisions were found to be somewhat unwieldy, so afterward the 20th and other motorized divisions were reorganized to reduce their size by about a third, leaving them with six motorized infantry battalions organized into two regiments, plus ordinary divisional support units. In May 1940 the division took part in the invasion of France, and remained there on occupation duty until April 1941, except for one brief period on reserve in Germany. In June 1941 it joined Operation Barbarossa under Army Group Centre. In September it was transferred to Army Group North, and it spent most of 1942 on the Volkhov Front. In December it was transferred back to Army Group Centre for the relief attempt at the Battle of Velikiye Luki. In July 1943 it was redesignated as 20th Panzergrenadier Division; by that time it had been given an assault gun battalion to support its infantry.

Two members of the division, Lieutnant Wolfgang Lehnigk-Emden and NCO Kurt Schuster were sentenced to life in prison in absentia by an Italian court for their role in the Caiazzo massacre, the murder of twenty-two civilians at Caiazzo, near Naples, in October 1943 but not extradited. Lehnigk-Emden was captured by Allied forces during the war, confessed the crime but then released by accident. He was found guilty of manslaughter by the Bundesgerichtshof , Germany's highest court but released because of the Statute of limitations had expired. This caused considerable outrage in both Germany and Italy because of the particularly brutal nature of the crime, and was seen as a Miscarriage of justice.

The attack on the Soviet Union  In early 1941 it was transferred to East Prussia, and in June it joined in the invasion of the Soviet Union as part of 18th Army (again commanded by von K√ºchler and once again under Army Group North). The division participated in the occupation of Tallinn and the Moonsund Archipelago. = Attack on the Moonsund Archipelago = After the fall of Tallinn the Germans had to clear the Baltic Islands to get full and unhindered use of the sea lanes. Units of the 61st division were transported by the Navy to Saaremaa, the southern Island, see Operation Beowulf. The island was defended by 3rd Independent Brigade of the 8th Army of the Leningrad front, plus coastal artillery, and naval units. there were also a small number of fighter planes on the airport. Most of the 60-mile-long island was cleared by 21 September by the 176th & 151st Infantry Regiments, except for the Sorve Peninsula. Here The Russian forces dug in and resisted stubbornly until 5 October. With the southern Island finally cleared the attack was extended to Hiiumaa, the northern Island on 12 October. Within 2 weeks the island was cleared and the Germans claimed 16.000 prisoners and to have captured 100 artillery pieces.Russo-German War, Autumn 1941: Defeat of Barbarossa, page 12 The way was open now for the Soviet Naval forces in the north to be bottled up in the Gulf of Finland, and the 61st Infantry was now available for redeployment. It took part in the Siege of Leningrad and remained in the area until January 1944, after which the Soviet Krasnoye Selo‚ÄìRopsha and Kingisepp‚ÄìGdov offensives forced it back into Estonia where it fought in the Battle of Narva, particularly in the Narva Offensive (18‚Äì24 March 1944). Held in reserve, it was one of only two divisions considered \\"fully combat effective\\" by the Army Group North in July of that year. The division was redesignated as 61st Volksgrenadier Division in October 1944, and continued fighting in the East under Army Groups North and Center. Evacuated to East Prussia, the division fought in the so-called Heiligenbeil pocket, caught between the advancing Soviets and the Frisches Haff. Once the \\"cauldron\\" collapsed in March 1945 the division was written off as a loss and its remaining assets were taken over by the 21st Infantry Division while the division staff was withdrawn to K√∂nigsberg, all falling into Soviet hands at the end of the war.  Organization  Established in August 1939 as part of the second wave. It was mobilised in Wehrkreis 1, East Prussia, with its headquarters at Insterburg The division had a standard early war infantry establishment. It had three infantry regiments of three infantry battalions, a gun company and an antitank company each. It had an artillery regiment of four battalions, containing in total nine batteries of 105mm light Field Howitzers and 3 batteries of 150mm heavy Field Howitzers. It also had a full reconnaissance battalion, which included 3 armoured cars. Its equipment was German, with a personnel establishment of 15,500 men. For mobility it had over 500 trucks, as well as other motor vehicles and motorcycles. It also had nearly 5,000 horses, and its soldiers marched into battle on foot.Die 61st Infanterie Division, page 8 In February 1940 the division gave up an infantry battalion and some artillery for the creation of the 291st Infantry division of the 8th wave, these units were recreated. The 61st Infantry Division consisted of the following units in May 1940: * 151st Infantry Regiment * 162nd Infantry Regiment * 176th Infantry Regiment * 161st Artillery Regiment * 161st Engineer Battalion * 161st Reconnaissance Battalion * 161st Anti-Tank Battalion * 161st Signals Battalion * 161st Supply Troops In November 1940 the division gave up an Infantry battalion from each Infantry Regiment for the formation of the 336th Infantry Division of the 14th wave. The battalions were replaced. The division suffered very heavy casualties in the Russian campaign, especially in infantry, so by the summer of 1942 three of its infantry battalions were officially disbanded, each Infantry Regiment now only having two battalions. Also the anti-tank battalion and the reconnaissance were merged to produce a schnelle (fast) battalion.Nafziger, German Order of Battle: Infantry in World War II, page 107 By 1943 the division's composition had been somewhat altered to the following: * 151st Grenadier Regiment * 162nd Grenadier Regiment * 176th Grenadier Regiment * 161st Artillery Regiment * 161st Engineer Battalion * 161st Anti- Tank Battalion * 161st Intelligence Battalion * 161st Supply Troop Command Once officially designated a Volksgrenadier Division in 1944, the unit was composed of the following: * 151st Grenadier Regiment * 162nd Grenadier Regiment * 176th Grenadier Regiment * 61st Fusilier Battalion * 161st Artillery Regiment  Commanders  The following officers commanded the 61st Infantry Division: * August 1939 - March 1942: General of Infantry Siegfried Haenicke * March 1942 - April 1942: Major General Franz Scheidies * April 1942 - February 1943: Lieutenant General Werner H√ºhner * February 1943 - April 1943: Lieutenant General G√ºnther Krappe * April 1943 - May 1943: Lieutenant General Gottfried Weber * May 1943 - December 1943: Lieutenant General G√ºnther Krappe (2nd time) * December 1943 - February 1944: Major General Joachim Albrecht von Bl√ºcher * from February 1944: Lieutenant General G√ºnther Krappe (3rd time)  Personnel  Thirty-seven of the division's personnel were Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients, including commanders Siegfried Haenicke, Werner H√ºhner, Gottfried Weber (when commander of the 1st battalion of the 162nd Infantry Regiment), and G√ºnther Krappe.

The goblet cells mainly use the merocrine method of secretion, secreting vesicles into a duct, but may use apocrine methods, budding off their secretions, when under stress. The term goblet refers to the cell's goblet-like shape. The apical portion is shaped like a cup, as it is distended by abundant mucus laden granules; its basal portion lacks these granules and is shaped like a stem. The goblet cell is highly polarized with the nucleus and other organelles concentrated at the base of the cell and secretory granules containing mucin, at the apical surface. The apical plasma membrane projects short microvilli to give an increased surface area for secretion. Goblet cells are typically found in the respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts and are surrounded by other columnar cells. Biased differentiation of airway basal cells in the respiratory epithelium, into goblet cells plays a key role in the excessive mucus production, known as mucus hypersecretion seen in many respiratory diseases, including chronic bronchitis, and asthma. Structure Goblet cells are found scattered among the epithelial lining of organs, such as the intestinal and respiratory tracts. They are found inside the trachea, bronchi, and larger bronchioles in the respiratory tract, small intestines, the large intestine, and conjunctiva in the upper eyelid. In the conjunctiva goblet cells are a source of mucin in tears and they also secrete different types of mucins onto the ocular surface. In the lacrimal glands, mucus is synthesized by acinar cells instead. Microanatomy Goblet cells are simple columnar epithelial cells, having a height of four times that of their width. The cytoplasm of goblet cells tends to be displaced toward the basal end of the cell body by the large mucin granules, which accumulate near the apical surface of the cell along the Golgi apparatus, which lies between the granules and the nucleus. This gives the basal part of the cell a basophilic staining because of nucleic acids within the nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum staining with hematoxylin. Mucin within the granules stains pale in routine histology sections, primarily because these carbohydrate-rich proteins are washed out in the preparation of microscopy samples. However, they stain easily with the PAS staining method, which colours them magenta. In mucicarmine stains, deep red mucin is found within goblet cell bodies. Goblet cells can be seen in the examples below as the larger, more pale cells.

Goblet cells accomplish this by secreting mucins, large glycoproteins formed mostly by carbohydrates. The gel-like properties of mucins are given by its glycans (bound carbohydrates) attracting relatively large quantities of water. On the inner surface of the human intestine, it forms a 200 ¬µm thick layer (less in other animals) that lubricates and protects the wall of the organ. Distinct forms of mucin are produced in different organs: while MUC2 is prevalent in the intestine, MUC5AC and MUC5B are the main forms found in the human airway. In the airway, mucus is swept by the cilia of the respiratory epithelium, in a process called mucociliary clearance, and propelled out of the lungs and into the pharynx, which results in the removal of debris and pathogens from the airway. MUC5AC is overexpressed in allergic lung inflammation. Mucins are continuously made and secreted by goblet cells in order to repair and replace the existing mucus layer. Mucins are stored in granules inside the goblet cells before being released to the lumen of the organ. Mucin secretion in the airway may occur via regulated secretion. Secretion may be stimulated by irritants such as dust and smoke, especially in the airway. Other stimuli are microbes such as viruses and bacteria. Anomalies in the number of goblet cells are associated with changes in the secretion of mucins, which can result in many of the abnormalities seen in asthma patients, such as clogged airways due to mucus hypersecretion, and eventual loss of lung function. Overexpression of MUC5AC alone does not result in the pathophysiology seen in asthma patients; it is the excessive production along with the speed of secretion that leads to the formation of thick mucus that cannot be removed by cilia or coughing action. This, in addition to airway narrowing leads to the clogging of the airways, which can be detrimental to health if not treated. There are other cells that secrete mucus (such as the foveolar cells of the stomach) \\\\- Digestive System: Alimentary Canal: fundic stomach, gastric glands, lumen\\" but these are distinguished histologically from goblet cells. Role in oral tolerance Oral tolerance is the process by which the immune system is prevented from responding to antigen derived from food products, as peptides from food may pass into the bloodstream via the gut, which would in theory lead to an immune response. A paper published in Nature in 2012 has shed some light on the process and implicated goblet cells as having a role in the process. It was known that CD103-expressing dendritic cells of the lamina propria had a role to play in the induction of oral tolerance (potentially by inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells), and this paper suggests that the goblet cells act to preferentially deliver antigen to these CD103+ dendritic cells. Clinical significance= Allergic asthma  The excessive mucus production seen in allergic asthma patients is due to goblet cell metaplasia, the differentiation of airway epithelial cells into mucin producing goblet cells. These cells produce the thick mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B, which clog the airway, leading to the airflow obstruction characteristic of asthma. Goblet cell metaplasia in allergic asthma is due to the action of the cytokine IL-13. IL-13 binds to the IL-4RŒ± receptor and initiates a STAT6 signalling response. Binding of IL-13 causes phosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the IL-4RŒ±. This results in docking of STAT6 monomers, which themselves are phosphorylated and then subsequently leave the receptor and congregate form STAT6 homodimers in the cytoplasm. These homodimers then enter the nucleus, where they bind to regulatory elements in the DNA, which affects the transcription of certain genes involved in mucus production. Induction of STAT6 signaling by IL-13 leads to increased of expression of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO-1), which is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids. 15-lipoxygenase acts by binding to phospholipids and yields hydroperoxy and epoxy metabolites. One such metabolite, 15-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (15-HETE), is released intracellularly, where it conjugates to phosphatidylethanolamine, a phospholipid component. 15-HETE-PE induces expression of the mucin MUC5AC.  Goblet cell carcinoids  Goblet cell carcinoids are a class of rare tumors that form as a result of an excessive proliferation of both goblet and neuroendocrine cells. The majority of these tumors arise in the appendix and may present symptoms similar to the much more common acute appendicitis. The main treatment for localized goblet cells tumors is removal of the appendix, and sometimes removal of the right hemicolon is also performed. Disseminated tumors may require treatment with chemotherapy in addition to surgery. Goblet cells may be an indication of metaplasia, such as in Barrett's esophagus.  Treatments  Monoclonal antibodies = Studies of mice given monoclonal antibodies for IL-13 results in decreased expression of goblet cells in asthma patients. Some treatments that use anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies include tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab. These treatments have shown improvements in asthma patients, yet there are still limitations to the use of anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies. Dupilumab is a newer drug that targets the shared receptor of IL-4 and IL-13, IL4RŒ±. Since IL-4 and IL-13 have interrelated biological activities, Dupilumab is a more effective form of treatment as it targets both interleukins. History The cells were first noted by Henle in 1837 when studying the lining of the small intestine, seen to be mucus producing by Leydig in 1857 (who was examining the epidermis of fish), and were given their name by Schulze in 1867, Schulze chose the descriptive name \\"goblet\\" because of the shape of the cell, rather than a functional name, as he remained uncertain as to the mucous-producing function of the cell. Nowadays these cells are used in the laboratories to evaluate the intestinal absorption of drug targets with different kits, such as the CacoGoblet.

I-235 runs from the junction of Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 in West Des Moines to the separation of the same two interstates in Ankeny. The highway is approximately long. I-235, which had seen little improvement since its construction in the 1960s, was completely rebuilt and widened in a project that spanned most of the 2000s. Prior to the reconstruction, I-235 had two lanes in each direction with a third lane near downtown; the entire route now has at least three lanes of traffic in each direction, with an additional one or two lanes closer to the heart of the city. The modernized freeway now handles on average between 75,000-125,000 vehicles per day, making it the busiest highway in the state of Iowa. Route description Interstate 235 begins at the western intersection of Interstate 35 and Interstate 80, known locally as the West Mixmaster. Here, eastbound I-80 exits the highway, which becomes I-235 and joins northbound I-35. From the West interchange, I-235 heads east. Almost immediately is a half-diamond interchange with 50th Street in West Des Moines. later is a partial-cloverleaf interchange with Valley West Drive, which was renamed from 35th Street in 1988 due to its proximity to Valley West Mall and Valley High School. At Windsor Heights at a tight partial-cloverleaf interchange I-235 meets 73rd Street / 8th Street. The interchange is particularly tight because of an Iowa Interstate Railroad line just to the east. 73rd Street / 8th Street is actually a single road: north of I-235, 73rd Street follows the Des Moines street numbering plan, while south of I-235, 8th Street follows the older street numbering plan of West Des Moines. Midday traffic on I-235 At the 63rd Street interchange, I-235 picks up a fourth lane of eastbound travel and drops a lane westbound. Now within the city limits of Des Moines, it passes the through the heavily wooded Waterbury neighborhood. Near the 42nd Street interchange, I-235 curves to the south around Theodore Roosevelt High School. later is an interchange with 31st Street, which provides access to Drake University to the north, and to Terrace Hill, the governor's mansion, to the south. East of 31st Street, I-235 briefly picks up a fifth lane and drops a lane westbound, creating a 10-lane freeway just west of downtown. This stretch of freeway receives, on average, over 125,000 vehicles per day, making it the busiest stretch of road in the state. alt=The skyline of a city. A bridge crosses a river in the center. There are three eastbound interchanges connecting I-235 to downtown Des Moines. Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway and 19th Street, a pair of one-way streets, lead traffic to the west of downtown. Keosauqua Way, known locally as Keo Way, enters downtown from the northwest. These interchanges are combined westbound. Closer to the Des Moines River, a combined interchange in each direction filters off the rest of downtown traffic to two destinations: Seventh Street and Sixth Avenue, and Third Street and Second Avenue, each of which are pairs of one-way streets. The fourth lane of traffic drops off at this combined interchange. At the Des Moines River, I-235 passes Wells Fargo Arena, the main Iowa Events Center facility, which lies to the south along the western bank and the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden to the north on the eastern bank. On the eastern side of Des Moines, it skirts the northern edge of the East Village, the Iowa State Capitol, and East High School before the interchange with U.S. Route 69. east is an interchange with East University Avenue, which, up to now had been relatively parallel to I-235. East University provides access to the Iowa State Fairgrounds for northbound I-35 and eastbound I-80 traffic. At University Avenue, I-235 begins curving to the north, dividing an industrial district to the west and residential areas to the east. to the north, it intersects East Euclid Avenue at a partial-cloverleaf interchange. It continues north for another until it meets Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 again at the East interchange. History alt=See caption The first section of Interstate 235 to open, from Cottage Grove Avenue to Keo Way, opened on December 14, 1961. Over the next seven years, sections of I-235 opened, spreading east and west toward the interchanges until it was completed on October 30, 1968. In October 1963, the Des Moines city council designated I-235 the John MacVicar Freeway in honor of two former mayors of Des Moines: John MacVicar, Sr., (1896-1900, 1916-1918, 1928) and John MacVicar, Jr., (1942-1948). However, this name is seldom used; most people simply refer to it as I-235. In March 2002, a six-year-long project to completely rebuild I-235 and the bridges which cross it began. The first two years consisted of rebuilding most of the bridges which cross it, starting with 42nd Street in West Des Moines. The final four years of the project entailed finishing the remaining bridges, widening, regrading, and repaving the entire length of the highway. alt=A large arched suspension bridge passes over a busy highway. The nighttime skyline is seen through the cable supports. Pedestrian bridges An additional part of the highway improvement plan were three pedestrian bridges, located at 40th, 44th, and East 6th Streets. The three bridges were replacements for bridges which were too narrow to accommodate the newly widened highway. These highly visible bridges act as icons, locating the neighborhoods for travelers along the freeway. The design of the I-235 pedestrian bridges was completed by Boston- based bridge designer Miguel Rosales in collaboration with HNTB Engineering. The three bridges, the Edna M. Griffin Memorial Bridge (East 6th Street), the 40th Street Pedestrian Bridge, and the Rider Way Pedestrian Bridge (44th Street) were each completed by 2005. The new design utilizes basket-handle steel arches with clear spans of approximately . Inclined cables connect the steel blue arches to the pre-stressed concrete deck. By selecting a tied arch form, the Iowa Department of Transportation was able to keep disruption of traffic to a minimum during construction. An innovative curved screen system is used to enhance security and the appearance of the structure creating a visually appealing experience for pedestrians and bicyclists using the bridge. The resulting series of bridges has created a distinctive form that is unique to the city and the state.

Until 1968 the only inhabitants of the island were the lighthouse keeper and his family, who had the responsibility for operating the Faro de Lobos lighthouse located at Punta Marti√±o at the northern tip of the island, a prominent local landmark (his name was Antonito; a school in the town of Corralejo was named after him). The island was one of the first natural areas of the Canary Islands to be designated as a natural park in 1982. Later the island was also designated an area of special protection for birds, and many marine species of migratory birds inhabit the island. The island as seen from the town of Corralejo Aerial view of Lobos Island, with the harbour of Corralejo, Fuerteventura Island, in the top left corner  Geography  Lobos Island, like the rest of the Canary Islands, is a volcanic island. Its age is estimated between 6,000 and 8,000 years. The highest point is on the island's volcanic caldera, Monta√±a La Caldera, above sea level. The island includes a small lake, but the low rainfall creates an arid landscape.  Fauna and flora  Despite being a desert and a volcanic landscape, Lobos Island has a large number of natural habitats. There are over 130 plant species, including the siempreviva (Limonium ovalifolium), which is endemic to the island, and the Sea Uvilla (Tetraena fontanesii) which is very attractive because of its shape and color. Likewise, birds are an important feature of the island: it has a great variety of seabirds that usually nest on cliffs and rocks. Among these species are the shearwater Cinderella, little shearwater and the herring gull. Also in residence are the storm petrel, Bulwer's petrel and yellow-legged gull. In addition to birds a great diversity of fish can be spotted in its waters. Of these abound old fish (Canarian fish), barracuda, hammerhead shark, bream and striped fish. Because of its great ecological diversity the site has been designated as a protected zone, the Parque Natural del Islote de Lobos. It has also been declared a special protection area (SPA) for birds.  Tourism  The island is a popular location for day trips for tourists visiting from Fuerteventura who have an interest in flora, fauna and geology. Regular boat services ferry passengers from Corralejo harbour during daylight hours. To protect the natural landscape from human impact, access is limited to restricted areas and to a series of walking trails, marked by directional signs to protect the conservation areas. The paths take visitors from the boat jetty through a varied landscape, including to the lighthouse at Punto Martino and to the top of the caldera. There is a small, sheltered sea lagoon, Playa de la Concha, with a sandy beach for bathing. Visitors, before 2007, could ask for authorisation from Fuerteventura local government's environment office to camp on the island, for a maximum of three nights, in one permitted location known as \\"El carpintero\\" (the carpenter's). Since 2007 it is prohibited to camp on the island.

Background Connor was born May 23, 1946 in Charleston, South Carolina to his parents George Connor and Mary Connor. Connor graduated from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky and held a doctor of ministry degree. Ministry In 1985 the ministry of exorcism was first introduced to him when he encountered a woman who was a third generation satanist. From then on he ministered to people with spiritual oppression. He said of exorcisms that, \\"when one experiences it face-to-face ‚Äì when one sees evil, smells it, feels it, has things thrown in his face, encounters evil prowling around like a lion ‚Äì then you know there's a spiritual warfare going on all around us.\\"Baptist Press, 27-year veteran leaving pastorate to launch 'ministry of deliverance', Todd Deaton, October 14, 1998 In 1998, after twenty-seven years as a pastor at Southern Baptist churches in Maryland and South Carolina he left his ministry to become a full-time exorcist and run his deliverance ministry. Connor believed that spiritual oppression is a real part of biblical metaphysics, which includes angels, demons and Satan. Connor stated that even people who go to church regularly or minister can still be oppressed. \\"By belonging to Jesus Christ, we are forgiven in terms of salvation,\\" he explained.Baptist Press, 27-year veteran leaving pastorate to launch 'ministry of deliverance', Todd Deaton, October 14, 1998 \\"We can still make wrong choices which open doors within us to satanic oppression by dabbling in the occult, attempting to communicate with the dead, using crystals, accepting New Age beliefs, following spirit guides, participating in rituals.\\" \\"Anytime someone reaches out to an evil spirit, that spirit puts down roots and will torment and oppress that person,\\" Connor stated. On November 13, 2001, he appeared on Dateline NBC casting demons out of an American baptist. He founded and led the Good Shepherd Institute which helped spiritually oppressed people.

Naval career= Early career  Following his father into the navy in 1771, Carnegie served in the American War of IndependencePromoted Lieutenant in 1777 on the frigate and the ship of the line , being involved in the Battle of Martinique in 1780 under Admiral Rodney. His good conduct during the engagement was recognised by Rodney, who promoted Carnegie to commander1781 and then aided his rise to Post captain in 1782, whereupon he was given command of the frigate . Ten years later at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, on 22 January 1792, Carnegie had acceded to the earldom and became the Earl of Northesk. He was given a new ship of the line to command in 1796 and having as his first lieutenant Charles Bullen, the start of an excellent professional partnership and close personal friendship. The following year he was caught up in the Nore mutiny but was released by the mutineers to take their demands to London. Like many in the fleet, Northesk had some sympathy with the initial stages of the mutiny, and so when the demands were refused, he resigned his position as untenable following his failure to restore order on his ship or gain concessions from the government. William Carnegie as a Post Captain of 3 year seniority Reinstated by the Admiralty in 180323 April 1803 with full seniority as a rear-admiral, Northesk was given the 100 gun first rate as his flagship, and after a brief period in the Channel Fleet, was sent south with Sir Robert Calder to join the blockading squadrons off Spain. With him went Captain Bullen. He missed the Calder's action in 1805, and joined Nelson's fleet off Cadiz that same year. Battle of Trafalgar As the inevitable Battle off Cape Trafalgar came closer, Northesk was largely left out of the planning of the encounter, partly because he was the third most senior admiral present behind Nelson and Collingwood and partly because unlike most of the captains at the battle, Northesk had never worked with Nelson before and was not a member of the famous Band of Brothers. Nonetheless, when battle came Northesk was ready and although his slow ship took some time to reach the fighting, he was heavily engaged with the enormous Spanish 130 gun ship Santissima Trinidad, the Britannia suffering 52 casualties10 killed 42 wounded in the battle. He was greatly rewarded for his service in action, but like many Trafalgar captains, never served at sea again as sufficiently senior posts could not be found abroad. He was however initiated into the Order of the Bath, eventually reaching the position of Knight Grand Cross. He also reached the rank of full admiral, the ceremonial post of Rear-Admiral of Great Britain and was made Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth1827-1830 later in his career. Death He died in 1831 in LondonAlbemarle Street, Piccadilly, London. and was buried alongside Nelson and Collingwood in the crypt at St Paul's Cathedral, where his tomb can still be seen.\\"Memorials of St Paul's Cathedral\\" Sinclair, W. pp. 453/4: London; Chapman & Hall, Ltd; 1909.  Finance Career = British Linen Company  Northesk was instated as the Governor of the British Linen Company from 1800 to his death in 1831. The Company held an important history in the economic development of Scotland, as it stimulated industrial investment in the production of linen and spinning factories across the rural Highlands and the East Coast. By the nineteenth century, the Company had undergone a full transformation from a manufacturing company into a Bank and it stood alongside the great institutions of the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh.

Rodale Started Organic Gardening Magazine - Story told by Patricia Bragg - Interview 1/12\\" August 16, 1898 ‚Äì June 8, 1971) was a publisher, editor, author, playwright, and founder of Rodale, Inc. He was an early advocate of sustainable agriculture and organic farming in the United States. As an author, his work included several magazines and books, including books featuring different authors, on the subject of health. He popularized the term \\"organic\\" as a term for growing food without pesticides. Rodale also published works on other topics, including The Synonym Finder. Rodale died after suffering a fatal heart attack while appearing as a guest on a segment of The Dick Cavett Show. The segment has not been aired. Rodale was taken to Roosevelt Hospital Center and was pronounced dead on arrival at the age of 72. Biography Rodale was born in Manhattan on August 16, 1898, the son of a grocer, and raised on the Lower East Side. His birth name was Cohen, but presuming it would be a handicap in business, he changed it to a non- Jewish-sounding one. He worked as an accountant for New York City 1917-1920, and worked for the Internal Revenue Service 1920-21. His brother Joseph and he co-founded Rodale Manufacturing, a maker of electrical equipment, in New York in 1923. He married Anna Andrews in 1927, she died in 2000 at 95. and had three children: Robert Rodale (1930‚Äì1990), Nina Rodale (who married Robert Hale Horstman and then married Arthur Houghton), and Ruth Rodale. Rodale was already concerned with his health at this time, as he had frequent heart murmurs and had been rejected from the Army in World War I for bad eyesight. To improve his health, he read the works of Bernarr Macfadden and invented an exercising device. The Rodale brothers moved Rodale Manufacturing to Emmaus, Pennsylvania, in 1930 to cut costs during the Depression. He founded Rodale Press in 1930, marketing books and magazines. Inspired by his encounter with the ideas of Albert Howard, Rodale developed an interest in promoting a healthy and active lifestyle that emphasized organically grown foods, and established the Rodale Organic Gardening Experimental Farm in 1940. Note: This includes Rodale Press started publishing Organic Farming and Gardening magazine in 1942. Organic Farming and Gardening promotes organic horticulture; later, the magazine was retitled Organic Gardening. To Rodale, agriculture and health were inseparable. Healthy soil required compost and eschewing pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Eating plants grown in such soil would then help humans stay healthier, he expounded. One of Rodale's most successful projects was Prevention magazine, founded in 1950, which promotes practices preventing disease rather than trying to cure it later. It pioneered the return to whole grains, unrefined sweets, using little fat in food preparation, folk cures, herbal medicines, and breastfeeding. It also promoted the consumption of higher than typical amounts of nutritional supplements and forgoing nicotine and caffeine. Rodale opposed the consumption of milk and sugar, which he blamed on causing many diseases. He was not a vegetarian and frequently denounced vegetarianism.Greene, Wade. (1971). \\"Guru of the Organic Food Cult\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 10 February 2019. Rodale was also a playwright, operating the Cecilwood Theater in Fishkill, New York, and the off-Broadway Rodale Theater at 62 East Fourth Street in the East Village. Rodale's plays included Toinette (1961) and The Hairy Falsetto (1964). Death Rodale died of a heart attack at the age of 72 while participating as a guest on an early-evening taping of The Dick Cavett Show slated to be aired that same night, Tuesday, June 8, 1971. Rodale was still on stage, having finished his interview, and was seated on a couch next to the active interviewee, New York Post columnist Pete Hamill. Rodale had stated during his just-completed interview on the show, \\"I'm in such good health that I fell down a long flight of stairs yesterday and I laughed all the way\\", \\"I've decided to live to be a hundred\\", and \\"I never felt better in my life!\\" He had also previously said, \\"I'm going to live to be 100, unless I'm run down by some sugar-crazed taxi driver.\\" According to Dick Cavett, Hamill noticed something was wrong with Rodale, leaned over to Cavett, and said, \\"This looks bad.\\" According to others, Cavett asked, \\"Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?\\" Cavett himself said that he \\"emphatically\\" did not recall saying this, but one of the two physicians in the audience did remember this. The physicians (an internist and orthopedic surgeon, both in residency) rushed onto the stage to try to revive Rodale with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including mouth-to- mouth resuscitation. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson that originally aired on February 5, 1982, Cavett stated \\"firefighters from across the street\\" also attended Rodale. Although an electrocardiogram continued to show cardiac activity, they were unsuccessful; Rodale was pronounced dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital..Eric White, MD, was one of the physicians present. The episode was never broadcast, although Cavett has described the story in public appearances and on his blog. Legacy After Rodale's death, his son Robert Rodale ran the publishing firm until his own death in a car accident in 1990. That work included editing the high- circulation Prevention magazine. Robert Rodale had competed in the Olympics in rifle shooting and was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1991. Rodale's granddaughter Maria Rodale became chairman and CEO of Rodale, Inc. She attributes her interest in the organic food movement to growing up on America's first certified organic farm.Maria's Farm Country Kitchen In October 2017 New York media giant Hearst Corp. announced it would acquire the magazine and book businesses of the 90-year-old Rodale Inc. for an undisclosed price.

For example, Rodale accused sugar of \\"causing criminals\\", and blamed various diseases including bronchitis and pneumonia on the consumption of bread. He also believed that consumers of cola drinks would become sterile. Rodale was an anti-vaccinationist.McGrath, Maria. (2014). \\"The Bizarre Life (and Death) of ‚ÄúMr. Organic‚Äù\\". The New Republic. Retrieved 10 February 2019. He also made dubious claims about cancer. In his book Happy People Rarely Get Cancer (1970), Rodale stated that \\"Negroes get less cancer than whites, for the Negro is a happy race. True, there is their problem of segregation, but the Negro race being what it is, I think a Negro sings just the same, and is not going to let segregation dampen his spirits as much as a similar problem would do to the white person.\\" It was reported that Rodale took seventy food supplements every day. He was criticized for promoting dubious claims about vitamins supplements. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch commented that the Prevention magazine was filled with \\"nonsense promoting dietary supplements... many articles contained therapeutic claims that would be illegal on product labels.\\" The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, noted that the agricultural establishment \\"dismissed Rodale as a quack, crank, a gadfly, and a manure-pile worshiper.\\"Smith, Andrew F.

Her awards include a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. Biography=Early life Kakutani, a Japanese American, was born on January 9, 1955, in New Haven, Connecticut. She is the only child of Yale mathematician Shizuo Kakutani and his wife Keiko (\\"Kay\\") Uchida. Her father was born in Japan, her mother was a second-generation Japanese-American who was raised in Berkeley, California. Michiko received her B.A. in English literature from Yale University in 1976, where she studied under author and Yale writing professor John Hersey, among others.. Career Kakutani initially worked as a reporter for The Washington Post, and then from 1977 to 1979 for Time magazine, where Hersey had worked. In 1979, she joined The New York Times as a reporter. Kakutani worked as a literary critic for The New York Times from 1983 until her retirement in 2017. Her periodically harsh reviews of some prominent authors have garnered both attention and, on occasion, criticism. For example, in 2006, Kakutani called Jonathan Franzen's The Discomfort Zone \\"an odious self-portrait of the artist as a young jackass\\". Franzen reportedly subsequently called Kakutani \\"the stupidest person in New York City\\". Another example is that, in 2012, Kakutani wrote a negative review of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Antifragile. In 2018, Taleb stated in his book Skin in the Game that \\"someone has to have read the book to notice that a reviewer is full of baloney, so in the absence of skin in the game, reviewers such as Michiko Kakutani\\" can \\"go on forever without anyone knowing\\" that they are fabricating and drunk. According to Kira Cochrane in The Guardian, such counterattacks may have bolstered Kakutani's reputation as commendably \\"fearless\\". She has been known to write reviews in the voice of movie or book characters, including Brian Griffin, Austin Powers, Holden Caulfield, Elle Woods of Legally Blonde, and Truman Capote's character Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's. On July 19, 2007, The New York Times published a pre-release story written by Kakutani about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. An account of the ensuing controversy, including the critical comments of some Harry Potter fans, can be found on the newspaper's Public Editor's blog. Kakutani was parodied in the essay \\"I Am Michiko Kakutani\\" by one of her former Yale classmates, Colin McEnroe. Kakutani announced that she was stepping down as chief book critic of the Times on July 27, 2017.\\"Michiko Kakutani Is Retiring\\", Press Run, NYT, July 27, 2017. In an article summing her book reviewing career, a writer in Vanity Fair called her \\"the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world\\" and credited her with boosting the careers of George Saunders, Mary Karr, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Franzen, Ian McEwan, Martin Amis, and Zadie Smith. In July 2018, Kakutani published a book criticizing the Trump administration titled The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump. Kakutani is a fan of the New York Yankees. Her aunt, Yoshiko Uchida, was an author of children's books.

Conventional wisdom held that the strength of human players lay in their ability to focus on particular positions rather than follow every possible line of play to its ultimate conclusion.

Broken into 2 designations, it serves as a bypass of Wilmington; providing a direct route between the Grand Strand and I-40. Officially known as the John Jay Burney Jr. Freeway, it is also known as the Wilmington Outer Loop, Wilmington Bypass and Northern Outer Loop. I-140 is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that runs between U.S. Route 17 (US 17) near Leland to I-40 near Murrayville. NC 140 travels between I-40 and US 17 in Kirkland. Route description End I-140 shield at I-40 I-140 begins at a trumpet interchange with US 17 west of downtown Wilmington. From there, it heads north, meeting US 74/US 76\\\\. Turning east, it interchanges with Mount Misery Road and Cedar Hill Road. It then crosses the Cape Fear River before interchanging with US 421\\\\. Continuing past US 421, I-140 continues in a northeasterly direction where it crosses the Northeast Cape Fear River on the Dan Cameron Bridge. After crossing the river, the route travels in an easterly direction where it meets NC 133 at a folded diamond interchange in Wrightsboro. From NC 133, I-140 continues to the east en route to its eastern terminus in Murraysville at an interchange with I-40,Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed April 25, 2010 via ACME Mapper a partial cloverleaf interchange with a flyover ramp from eastbound I-140 to westbound I-40. Here, I-140 ends and the road continues east as NC 140 through an undeveloped wooded area. After passing through the construction area for an interchange with the proposed NC 417 (Military Cutoff Road), NC 140 ends as US 17 merges into the road from a trumpet interchange in Kirkland. The most notable feature of the existing route is the bridge spanning the Northeast Cape Fear River. The bridge measures in length with a main span of and of vertical clearance above the river, Rat Island and adjacent marshlands. Its construction consists of precast girders with cast-in-place decks leading to the main span consisting of cast-in-place cantilevered box girder elements. In November 2005, the North Carolina Board of Transportation voted unanimously to name the I-140 bridge across the Northeast Cape Fear River in honor of former Wilmington mayor and businessman Dan Cameron. In an effort to protect scenic viewsheds for motorists utilizing the freeway, the Special Highway Overlay District of the New Hanover County Zoning Ordinance was adopted by the County Commission in June 2001. Some of the restrictions of the overlay include the banning the construction of billboards, limiting outdoor storage and increasing setback requirements for structures adjacent to the roadway. Only nine applications for billboards along I-140 were processed and approved prior to its passage. Dedicated and memorial names I-140/NC 140 feature three dedicated or memorialized stretches of freeway. * L.

Rabon Bridge ‚Äì Official North Carolina name of bridge at the junction of I-140 and US 17, near Winnabow (approved: June 2, 2014). History I-140 at I-40 Preliminary designations NCDOT may have tried two attempts to add I-140 in the state. The first appeared in the 1976 AAA map showing a proposed designation of I-140 between Beaucatcher Tunnel (US 70) and I-40 in east Asheville. The following year, the designation was changed to I-240, which would continue through Beaucatcher Tunnel (eventually through the Beaucatcher Cut when established) and replacing NC 191 to reconnect with I-40. It has not been confirmed if NCDOT actually submitted a request or not with AASHTO. The second and confirmed preliminary designation was in 1999, when NCDOT submitted a request to AASHTO to designate of US 1 from I-40, in Raleigh, heading westerly to the future US 421 (Sanford Bypass) interchange, in Sanford. On April 17, 1999, the request was disapproved by the committee and has since been dropped. Northern Outer Loop The idea of constructing a northern bypass for Wilmington was initially identified by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) as a need in 1972. The outer loop was viewed as a means to help relieve traffic congestion along Market Street and the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge through central Wilmington in New Hanover County serving as both an additional crossing of the Cape Fear River and providing for better regional connectivity. However, the project was not included as part of the department's construction schedule until 1989. In 1991, NCDOT initiated the evaluation of a pair of proposed routes for the Northern Outer Loop. The northern routing was to have been approximately in length and resulted in the relocation of 19 homes, 19 businesses, traversed of wetlands, nine potential hazardous waste sites and five historic sites. The southern routing was to have been approximately in length and resulted in the relocation of 58 homes, 8 businesses, traversed of wetlands, seven potential hazardous waste sites and eight historic sites. In November 1994, North Carolina Board of Transportation elected to move forward with the southern routing. The initial link between I-40 and US 421 was originally to begin construction in 1998 and open by 2001. Due to significant opposition by both local residents and officials, NCDOT unveiled a revised routing in April 1996 that located the route north of the initial proposal. This revised \\"central route\\" was selected as the final routing by NCDOT in April 1997. At the time of its announcement, the route was estimated to cost $126.5 million to complete and result in the displacement of 20 homes, 8 businesses, the loss of of wetlands and the loss of of farmland lost. Planning would continue through the late 1990s culminating with the first contract awarded for its construction in November 2000 for the I-40 interchange. I-140 designation In 1997 local officials initially stated that an interstate designation was sought for the bypass. In September 2002, the Federal Highway Administration announced that it would grant NCDOT's request and designate the Northern Outer Loop as Interstate 140. The designation was to apply to the initial western segment constructed between I-40 and US 421 and the initial eastern segment constructed between I-40 and US 17. At the time of its announcement, the designation was touted as a significant means to enhance economic development opportunities along its route in addition to potentially serving as a tie-in for moving the proposed eastern terminus of Interstate 74 from Myrtle Beach to Wilmington. Later that month, it was announced the segment east of I-40, would be named the John J. Burney Freeway after the state senator and trustee of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The initial $36.7 million contract for construction of a segment of the eastern leg was awarded by NCDOT to Barnhill Contracting Company in November 2003. Its construction had been delayed due to several conflicts including the handling of stormwater runoff into Futch Creek and a slight redesign of an off-ramp at the Porters Neck Road interchange to avoid a 450-year-old oak tree. Construction of the eastern segment commenced on December 29, 2003. As late as May 2005, NCDOT remained undecided as to whether or not to open only a portion of the road prior to completion of the elevated section due to the bridge section running behind schedule. By summer NCDOT decided to open the first segment of I-140 to traffic on August 22, 2005. Formally dedicated with Governor Mike Easley and U.S. Representative Mike McIntyre in attendance, the segment was located between I-40 and NC 133 (Castle Hayne Road). In June 2006, NCDOT announced two additional segments of the I-140 project would open by the end of the month. Costing $187 million to complete, the US 17 expressway segment between Porters Neck Road and I-40 and the segment between NC 133 and US 421 both opened to traffic on June 30, 2006. Concurrent with its opening, the routing of US 17 through Wilmington was also moved to the newly opened expressway. The previous routing of US 17 through Wilmington was changed to U.S. Highway 17 Business, and the US 17 Truck designation was removed from Military Cutoff Road and Oleander Drive upon the opening of the bypass with through trucks being directed to utilize the newly constructed freeway.  Brunswick County construction  Originally, the freeway was scheduled to be extended from its current terminus at US 421 to US 74-76 first. Construction began on this leg in 2014 and is scheduled to be the final segment of the route to open in 2017. The route was opened on December 15, 2017. In 2009, NCDOT announced plans to complete the southern portion of the western leg instead of the central portion requiring construction of a bridge across the Cape Fear River. In response to this decision, city leaders from the town of Navassa filed a discrimination complaint against NCDOT claiming the town is frequently denied funding for infrastructure improvements and other projects. Planning for future construction continued, and in March 2010 NCDOT awarded an $81.7 million contract to Barnhill Contracting Company. The project involved the construction of the segment between the US 74/76 intersection and US 17 south of Leland. Construction of the segment began in March 2010 as a result of receiving partial funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. As part of the expansion into Brunswick County, NCDOT designed several wildlife crossings to allow for the black bear and other animals to safely cross the corridor in the vicinity of the Battle Royal Natural Heritage Site. The crossings included the extension of four bridges to provide some upland areas from animal crossings along water bodies and the construction of a by wildlife tunnel just north of the US 74-76 interchange. This section of freeway was opened to traffic in September 2014. NC 140 designation With the opening of the Brunswick segment, a new designation appeared, North Carolina Highway 140 (NC 140). On January 14, 2015, the Certification of Rulemaking was released confirming the establishment of the new designation along, not only the Brunswick segment, but all existing and future sections of the Wilmington bypass. The justification in the paperwork for using NC 140 was it would serve as a temporary designation until the entire bypass was complete and the remaining segments could be submitted to AASHTO approval as I-140. The other rationalization was to provide an alternate designation for the entire Bypass if a proposal by NCDOT to return US 17 to the streets of Wilmington was enacted since only on the New Hanover segment is I-140 concurrent with US 17\\\\. NCDOT officials in the summer of 2014 called for returning US 17 to its original routing through Wilmington on Market Street, with the exception of placing a part of it on Military Cutoff Road and Oleander Drive, due to traffic volume on these roads being large enough to merit a route designation, which neither of these roads had. The proposal was endorsed by the Wilmington area Transportation Advisory Committee in August 2014. AASHTO's Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering approved the request on May 14, 2015. On May 17, 2017, US 17 was officially rerouted through Wilmington again. Leland- Wrightsboro segment On December 15, 2017, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held for the final section of I-140 between US 74/US 76 and US 421\\\\. However, the segment of road did not officially open to traffic until December 19, 2017, due to the road requiring final construction and cleanup, officially completing I-140 around Wilmington. The section cost $204 million and included two bridges over the Cape Fear River, with of stone and of fill material. Once completed, I-140 was extended west to replace NC 140 between US 17 and US 74/US 76\\\\. Future In 2002, the North Carolina Board of Transportation appropriated $10 million for the construction of an interchange at Blue Clay Road. The interchange would serve in providing better access to both Wilmington International Airport and the Cape Fear Community College North Campus, and will be constructed sometime in the unspecified future. An interchange is currently being constructed with the proposed NC 417 as part of the extension of Military Cutoff Road. Construction began in 2017 and the interchange is expected to open to traffic in 2022, serving as the northern terminus of NC 417\\\\. Work is also slated to begin in 2020 on a northward extension of NC 417 from this interchange as the Hampstead Bypass, concluding in 2025.

One late example is kept in Klosterneuburg Monastery. History The first archducal coronet (Erzherzogskrone) was shown on a portrait of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, though this coronet probably never existed. Ernest the Iron (1377‚Äì1424) had a coronet made, and another was made on the death of Archduke Ferdinand II of the Tyrol in 1595. The final crown of the Archduchy of Austria was made in 1616 for the regent of the Tyrol, Maximilian III. Its place of production remains unknown. It is kept at Klosterneuburg Monastery in Lower Austria. It was brought to Vienna in 1620 for the Ceremony of Homage by the Estates (the so-called Erbhuldigung) for the new ruler, and was last there in 1835. Margaret of Austria, aunt of Emperor Charles V and Regent of the Netherlands, is also shown wearing one on her tomb by Conrad Meit and in some images.

It closely resembles the sport of curling, a Scottish sport.  Origin  The game has its origins in western Flanders, Belgium where it is known as 'Trabollen'  Rules  Players inspect the balls to determine points at the end of a round The balls are rolled down a trough shaped dirt or synthetic alley towards a feather that sticks out at a spot located approximately six feet from each lane end. The object of the game is to get the ball as close to the feather as possible. Teams take turns rolling 12 balls (6 for each team) and may knock their opponent's balls out of the way, similar to Bocce. A coin flip determines which team rolls first. Typically, once this first team rolls two or three balls close to the feather, they roll the remainder of their balls so as to stop progressively shorter up the alley. This forces the team that rolls second to throw the balls in a manner that uses the curvature of the lane to weave around the \\"blocks\\", similar to a sine wave, in order to be able to get closer to the feather than the first team. The team with a ball or balls closest to the feather at the end of the round is awarded 1 point for each ball that is closer than the opponent's nearest ball. In the United States, scoring points is not dependent on their location in relation to the feather, other than being closer than the opponent's balls. No extra points are awarded for landing on the feather, which is placed as a visual guide. The game is over when one team scores 10 points.  Championships  The last featherbowling championship was held in Marseille, France on September 17, 2015.

The tallest measured shagbark, located in Savage Gulf, Tennessee, is over tall. Mature shagbarks are easy to recognize because, as their name implies, they have shaggy bark. This characteristic is, however, only found on mature trees; young specimens have smooth bark. The shagbark hickory's nut is edible and has a very sweet taste. The leaves are long, pinnate, with five (rarely three or seven) leaflets, the terminal three leaflets much larger than the basal pair. The shagbark hickory is monoecious. Staminate flowers are borne on long- stalked catkins at the tip of old wood or in the axils of the previous season's leaves. Pistillate flowers occur in short terminal spikes.Tirmenstein, D.

Shagbark hickory nuts were a significant food source for the Algonquins. Red squirrels, gray squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, and mice are consumers of hickory nuts. Other consumers include black bears, gray and red foxes, rabbits, and bird species such as mallards, wood ducks, bobwhites, and wild turkey. The two varieties are: *Carya ovata var. ovata (northern shagbark hickory) has its largest leaflets over long and nuts long. *Carya ovata var. australis (southern shagbark hickory or Carolina hickory) has its largest leaflets under long and nuts long. Some sources regard southern shagbark hickory as the separate species Carya carolinae- septentrionalis.Bioimages: Carya carolinae-septentrionalis . Retrieved 2013-08-10. Name The word hickory is an aphetic form from earlier pohickory, short for even earlier pokahickory, borrowed from the Virginia Algonquian word pawcohiccora, hickory-nut meat or a milky drink made from it. Other names for this tree are Carolina Hickory, Scalybark Hickory, Upland Hickory, and Shellbark Hickory, with older binomial names of Carya ovata var. fraxinifolia, Carya ovata var. nuttallii, Carya ovata var. pubescens, Hicoria alba, Hicoria borealis, and Hicoria ovata.  Distribution  Shagbark hickory is found throughout most of the eastern United States, but it is largely absent from the southeastern and Gulf coastal plains and lower Mississippi Delta areas. An isolated population grows in eastern Canada as far north as Lavant Township, Canadian zone 4b. Scattered locations of shagbark hickory occur in the mountains of eastern Mexico.  Uses  Carya ovata fruit Carya ovata spring leaf cluster Phylloxera galls on C. ovata leaves The nuts are edible with an excellent flavor, and are a popular food among people and squirrels alike. They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the pecan in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function. C. ovata begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation. Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood. In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at The Hermitage, his plantation in Tennessee. The grave site was surrounded by a variety of trees, including six shagbark hickories. They stood there for 168 years until a storm in 1998 demolished over 1,200 trees at the site. Work on replanting them remains an ongoing project. In modern times, shagbark hickory is rarely used as an ornamental due to its large size, slow growth, difficulty of transplanting (all Juglandaceae species have large taproots) and nut litter. Hickory nuts were a food source for Native Americans, who used the kernel milk to make corn cakes and hominy. Shagbark hickory wood is used for smoking meat and for making the bows of Native Americans of the northern area. The lumber is heavy, hard, and tough, weighing 63 lb/ cu ft when air-dried,Collingwood, C.H., and Warren D. Brush. 1974. Knowing Your Trees. Revised and edited by Devereux Butcher. Washington, District of Columbia: The American Forestry Association. pp. 168‚Äì169. and has been employed for implements and tools that require strength. These include axles, axe handles, ploughs, skis, and drum sticks. The bark of the shagbark hickory is also used to flavor a maple-style syrup.  Genetics  Shagbark hickory hybridizes with pecan, Carya illinoensis, and shellbark hickory, C. laciniosa (C. x dunbarii Sarg.). Shagbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the Carya species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, bitternut, shellbark, and shagbark) have been described, though most are unproductive or have other flaws. A few hican varieties are commercially propagated.

The total length is . At first, I-540 was a short spur connecting Fort Smith and Van Buren to I-40 as one of the original five Arkansas Interstates. The route ran just over to US 271 near the Oklahoma state line. The growing Northwest Arkansas area and the University of Arkansas needed an Interstate connection to Little Rock, and through traffic north to Kansas City had also outgrown the winding US 71 north from I-40. The route was extended north to Mountainburg in the late 1990s on an all-new alignment (going under concurrency with I-40, one of the only auxiliary routes with a concurrency with its parent) with the route being completed to Bella Vista in January 1999. However, the segment north of I-40 became a part of Interstate 49 in 2014. Route description The older portion of I-540, completed in the 1970s, connects Interstate 40 southward to the Oklahoma state line, going through Van Buren and Fort Smith. This particular spur starts at Exit 7 on Interstate 40 (being 7 miles (11 km) east of the state line with Oklahoma). That point marks mile zero on this spur, in keeping with Interstate Highway rules that spur mileage begins at the \\"parent\\" route. The first 3 miles (5 km) are through Van Buren, before the bridge over the Arkansas River. The remainder, for a grand total of approximately , travels through Fort Smith. AHTD bid a $79 million project in 2013 for I-540 rehabilitation in Fort Smith that includes re-signing the route and renumbering the exits. Fort Smith route Beginning at the I-540 and I-40 junction in Van Buren, the route begins southward along the eastern boundary of Van Buren, with exits numbered sequentially heading south. The segment is largely concurrent with US 71\\\\. The first exit along this segment of I-540/US 71 is with US 64 and US 71B (US 71B), which leads west into the Van Buren Historic District and east to Alma. Continuing south, I-540/US 71 passes over Highway 162 (Kibler Road), with no access between the routes. An exit providing access to Highway 59, via Riggs Drive (southbound) or Twin Circle Drive (northbound), is just prior crossing the Arkansas River. After crossing the river, the highways enter Fort Smith and Sebastian County. I-540/US 71 run through a commercial area and has three exits with city collector roads before an exit for Phoenix Avenue, which gives access to Fort Smith Regional Airport. However, this exit does not have any access to southbound I-540/US 71. Now turning toward the southwest, I-540/US 71 have exits with Highway 45 (Greenwood Road) and Highway 255 (Zero Street). Following these intersections, US 71 departs I-540 southbound toward Texarkana, with US 71B terminating at the parent route at the exit. I-540 begins to pass through a residential area before its final exit at US 271 and Highway 253\\\\. Following this exit, the roadway continues but ceases to be I-540, becoming US 271 and entering Oklahoma. History The Interstate spur opened in phases. According to a 1970 road map of Fort Smith, exits 2-11 (Van Buren through the Zero Street exit) were opened, with later exits (12-14) and the roadway itself still under construction. Portions of the roadway that became I-540 around Fayetteville were built in the early 1970s, but upgraded and extended in the mid-1990s. The highway around Fayetteville originally received US 71 signage until the complete I-540 spur was opened. Originally, I-540 running from I-40 to Oklahoma through Fort Smith was originally signed east‚Äìwest, but with the construction of the spur that ran north through Northwest Arkansas to Bella Vista the entire I-540 was resigned as a north‚Äìsouth road. It is one of the few that have changed this way. In the late 1990s, I-540 was extended into Northwest Arkansas. It had been planned since the 1970s as a bypass of U.S. Highway 71. The first section, between Alma and Mountainburg was known as Arkansas Highway 540. Originally, the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) asked the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), who are in charge of Interstate and U.S. Highway route numbering, to allow the Interstate segment between Fort Smith and Bentonville to be named I-49, in order to emphasize plans to extend the route from Shreveport, Louisiana, through Arkansas to Kansas City, Missouri. AASHTO refused and the route opened on January 8, 1999, as a northern extension of I-540. On October 18, 2013, AASHTO approved AHTD's application to designate I-49 across the state, specifically allowing the state to renumber I-540 as I-49. The northern section of I-540 was renumbered I-49 in April 2014. Exit listArkansas Highway 540 Highway 540 (AR 540, Ark. 540, and Hwy. 540) was a temporary designation for what would later become Interstate 540 between Alma and Mountainburg in the U.S. state of Arkansas. Traveling a distance of approximately 12 miles, its southern terminus was at I-40 west of Alma and its northern terminus at US 71 in Mountainburg.

The film is a parody of the 1993 film The Fugitive and the 1995 film The Usual Suspects. Plot World-famous violinist Ryan Harrison (Leslie Nielsen, who had guest starred in two early episodes of The Fugitive television series in the 1960s) is seen giving a concert. Afterwards, he goes to a party where he meets Hibbing Goodhue (Michael York), a millionaire who sponsors Harrison's performances, as well as Goodhue's seductive wife Lauren (Kelly Le Brock) and his possible mistress Cass Lake (Melinda McGraw). The next evening, he finds a note from Lauren in his car which summons him to the Goodhue residence. When he goes to the Goodhue mansion, he bumps into Sean Laughrea (Aaron Pearl), who has just killed Goodhue (together with an unknown accomplice). A violent fight follows, during which Harrison discovers that Sean is missing an eye, an arm, and a leg, and he overhears the preparations for an operation with the codename \\"Hylander\\" before he is knocked out. When he wakes up, Harrison finds himself arrested and convicted for the murder of Goodhue. Desperate to prove his innocence, Harrison escapes from his prison transport following an accident. Lieutenant Fergus Falls (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene, takes charge, barks out orders and vows to do whatever it takes to capture the fugitive. Harrison returns to the Goodhue mansion where he encounters Cass, who is trying to retrieve something from behind a portrait. She tells him she knows he is innocent and believes Lauren is the killer, but refuses to say anything to the police because Lauren is her sister. She provides him with a place to hide and helps him shake his pursuers, but Harrison's opportunities to rest are short and fleeting: Falls seems to find him wherever he goes, and Cass behaves suspiciously, increasing Harrison's doubts of whom to trust. Harrison gradually begins to piece together the puzzle; he remembers that Sean was present at the party as the bartender and was given a great amount of money by Cass. He also finds that Cass is strangely interested in Sir Robert McKintyre, the secretary-general of the United Nations. Eventually, after investigating Sean's disabilities in a limb replacement clinic, he discovers that Cass, Lauren and Sean are planning an assassination attempt on McKintyre. He manages to follow the group but is caught. Cass shoots Harrison but actually fakes his death, both because she has fallen in love with him and because she wants to stop the assassination, since she has found out that McKintyre is really her father. Goodhue has been murdered by Sean and Lauren because he had come to suspect that his wife was actually a terrorist and had only used him to further her goals. At a Scottish festival, Harrison and Cass just barely manage to save McKintyre's life. They are cornered by Lauren, Sean and accomplices, but Fergus Falls and a SWAT team arrive just in the nick of time, arresting the terrorists. Falls officially tells Harrison that he was \\"wrongfully accused\\", clearing his name and acquitting him. In the last scene, Harrison and Cass are riding on the bow of a cruise ship (spoofing Titanic) and end up bumping their heads on a low bridge.

Reception=Box office The film opened on August 21, 1998 in 2,062 cinemas. On its opening weekend, it grossed USD $3,504,630 or approximately $1,700 per theatre. Wrongfully Accuseds overall gross was $9,642,860. Critical response Wrongfully Accused received generally negative reviews. It received a 21% \\"rotten\\" rating on the Rotten Tomatoes web site based on 33 reviews and a 4.11/10 rating. The site's consensus states: \\"Wrongfully Accused of being a comedy worthy of Leslie Nielsen's involvement, this misbegotten spoof might have fewer laughs than the straight-faced thriller that inspired it.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film only one out of four stars and wrote: \\"Wrongfully Accused is a mind-numbingly awful motion picture that has a better chance of making a viewer physically ill than of provoking a genuine laugh. Someone should sit down with Leslie Nielsen and suggest that, for his own good and the good of all those who go to his movies, he should retire. ... Nielsen may be a nice guy, but his increasingly feeble attempts at \\"comic\\" performances are becoming so painful to watch that I'm starting to dislike the man. ... Wrongfully Accused has nothing worth laughing at. With as many lame one-liners, visual gags, and puns as this script lobs at the audience, it comes as an absolute shock how humorless the results are. ... It's incomprehensible to think that anyone would find this movie funny‚Äîexcept the quote whores, that is.\\" Anita Gates of The New York Times wrote: \\"No one can accuse Wrongfully Accused of a shortage of jokes. ... Unfortunately, most of the jokes just aren't very funny. ... Maybe Pat Proft [...] works best as part of a team. Maybe he needs one of his old collaborators -- ideally David Zucker or Jim Abrahams -- to turn his concepts into punch lines. Without them, Wrongfully Accused [...] feels like a tangle of funny ideas all dressed up with nowhere to go. ... Throughout the film, Richard Crenna [...] seems right on the verge of making his Tommy Lee Jones imitation truly great, but he always just misses, maybe because he has only his attitude to work with. ... Even a cameo by the generally fabulous Sandra Bernhard falls flat. Things go better for Lamb Chop, the saccharine little sock puppet whose creator, Shari Lewis, died earlier this month. Lamb Chop has a cameo as an audience member in the opening concert scene and steals the show.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \\"Opening so soon after Mafia! tried our patience for the whole Airplane! and Naked Gun parody thing, Wrongfully Accused has a lot going against it. It's sloppy, tired, obvious, and overdone. ... But strewn throughout this shameless, old-fart comedy circus are so many giddy, good-natured, much-needed stink bombs aimed at middlebrow and lowbrow pop culture that a few are bound to hit the mark: The worst excesses of Baywatch, JFK, Anaconda, Charlie's Angels, Mission: Impossible, Braveheart, Titanic, and Field of Dreams are appropriately honored. So too are North by Northwest, Hong Kong action movies, and Mentos commercials.

It is an important concept in Buddhist praxis (Patipatti). The word bhavana normally appears in conjunction with another word forming a compound phrase such as citta-bhavana (the development or cultivation of the heart/mind) or metta- bhavana (the development/cultivation of lovingkindness). When used on its own, bhavana signifies contemplation and 'spiritual cultivation' generally. Etymology Bhavana derives from the word Bhava meaning becoming or the subjective process of arousing mental states. To explain the cultural context of the historical Buddha's employment of the term, Glenn Wallis emphasizes bhavanas sense of cultivation. He writes that a farmer performs bhavana when he or she prepares soil and plants a seed. Wallis infers the Buddha's intention with this term by emphasizing the terrain and focus on farming in northern India at the time in the following passage: Buddhism In the Pali Canon bhƒÅvanƒÅ is often found in a compound phrase indicating personal, intentional effort over time with respect to the development of that particular faculty. For instance, in the Pali Canon and post-canonical literature one can find the following compounds: :* citta-bhƒÅvanƒÅ, translated as \\"development of mind\\"See, e.g., DN 33.1.10(48), trans. by Walshe (1995), p. 486; and, MN 36, trans. by √ëƒÅamoli & Bodhi (2001), pp. 332-343. Both DN 33 and MN 36 juxtapose citta-bhƒÅvanƒÅ with kƒÅya-bhƒÅvanƒÅ. In DN 33, it is said that there are three types of development: of body (kƒÅya), of mind (citta), and of wisdom (pa√±√±ƒÅ). In end notes to MN 36, Bodhi (pp. 1228-29, nn. 382, 384) states that the MN commentary explains that \\"development of the body\\" refers to insight and \\"development of mind\\" refers to samƒÅdhi.Also see AN 1.22 and 1.24 (a/k/a, AN I,iii,1 and 3), trans. by Thanissaro (2006) ; and, AN 1.51-52 (a/k/a, AN I,vi,1-2), trans. by Thanissaro (1995) , as well as trans. by Nyanaponika & Bodhi (1999), p. 36. or \\"development of consciousness.\\" :* kƒÅya-bhƒÅvanƒÅ, translated as \\"development of body.\\" :* mettƒÅ-bhƒÅvanƒÅ, translated as the \\"cultivation\\"See, e.g., Sn 1.8, Metta Sutta, trans. by Thanissaro (2004). The compound metta-bhƒÅvanƒÅ does not actually exist in this sutta, but the sutta famously mentions that one should \\"cultivate\\" (bhƒÅvaye) a limitless heart of metta. or \\"development of benevolence.\\"See, e.g., Iti. 1.27, trans. by Ireland (1997) , pp. 169-70. :* pa√±√±ƒÅ-bhƒÅvanƒÅ, translated as \\"development of wisdom\\"See DN 33.1.10(48), trans. by Walshe (1995), p. 486, referenced in note above regarding citta-bhƒÅvanƒÅ. or \\"development of understanding.\\" :* samƒÅdhi-bhƒÅvanƒÅ, translated as \\"development of concentration.\\"See, e.g., AN 4.41, trans. Thanissaro (1997) (cf. Template:SamadhiBhavana). In addition, see MN 44, Cavedalla Sutta, trans. by Thanissaro (1998a): :[Layperson Viskha:] \\"Now what is concentration, lady, what qualities are its themes, what qualities are its requisites, and what is its development [samƒÅdhibhƒÅvanƒÅti]?\\" :[Bhikkhuni Dhammadinn:] \\"Singleness of mind is concentration, friend Visakha; the four frames of reference are its themes; the four right exertions are its requisites; and any cultivation, development, & pursuit of these qualities is its development.\\" In addition, in the Canon, the development (bhƒÅvanƒÅ) of samatha-vipassana is lauded.See, e.g., in MN 151, the Buddha states that a bhikkhu who has developed samatha- vipassana (or any of the seven sets of Enlightenment-conducive qualities) \\"can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states\\" (trans., √ëƒÅ·πáamoli & Bodhi, 2001, p. 1145). Additionally, AN 4.170 identifies three ways in which an arahant develops samatha-vipassana: samatha first; vipassana first; or both in tandem (Nyanaponika & Bodhi, 1999, p. 114; and, Thanissaro, 1998b). See also the paracanonical Nett 91 (Rhys Davids & Stede, 1921-25, p. 503, entry for \\"BhƒÅvanƒÅ\\", retrieved 9 December 2008 from \\"U. Chicago\\" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3558.pal). Subsequently, Theravada teachers have made use of the following compounds: :* samatha-bhƒÅvanƒÅ, meaning the development of tranquility. :* vipassanƒÅ-bhƒÅvanƒÅ, meaning the development of insight. The word bhavana is sometimes translated into English as 'meditation' so that, for example, metta-bhavana may be translated as 'the meditation on loving-kindness'. Meditation is properly called dhyana (Sanskrit; Pali: jhƒÅna), as practiced in samƒÅdhi, the 8th limb of the eightfold path. In Jainism In Jainism, bhƒÅvana refers to \\"right conception or notion\\" or \\"the moral of a fable\\".

Several scenarios are included that simulate the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Several other non-historical \\"what if\\" scenarios are also offered. The player is in command of the Allied Task Force fighting to defeat the Japanese Navy. Depending on the scenario played, the player's forces can be entirely American, or mostly American with some British Commonwealth elements. The solitaire rules attempt to recreate the incomplete knowledge that admirals had about the exact location of the opposing forces, and subsequent decisions that were taken with inexact or faulty intelligence. In 1992, a new scenario by Alan Arvold, The Battle of Rennell Island, was published in The General. Reception In Issue 73 of Fire & Movement, Jeff Petraska found the game to be challenging and suspenseful as he tried to find the Japanese fleet and then decide what forces to commit to battle, but he thought that the game relied too much on luck rather than skill.

The Sikh Regiment is an infantry regiment of the Indian Army. It is the most decorated regiment of the Indian Army and in 1979, the 1st battalion was the Commonwealth's most decorated battalion with 245 pre-independence and 82 post-independence gallantry awards, when it was transformed into the 4th battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment.[ Defence reviewhttp://mod.nic.in/samachar/18/html/ch8.htm ][Sikh review ][ Global security http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/army- equipment-mech.htm ] The first battalion of the regiment was officially raised just before the annexation of the Sikh Empire on August 1 1846, by the British East India Company. Currently, the Sikh Regimental Centre is located in Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand. The Centre was earlier located in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. The modern Sikh Regiment traces its roots directly from the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army. When transferred to the Indian Army like its sister regiments, the numeral prefix (in the case of the Sikh Regiment, 11) was removed and extra battalions were raised, transferred or disbanded to meet army needs. With a humble beginning of two battalions, today the fraternity has grown to a regiment of 19 regular infantry and two reserve battalions strong. History After the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-1846), Sikhs who lived in the territory ruled by the Sikh Empire (the Punjab region) began to be recruited into the Bengal Army of the British East India Company. Among the earliest entirely Sikh units of the Bengal Army were the Regiment of Ferozepore (raised in 1846) which later became the 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs, and the Regiment of Ludhiana (also raised in 1846) which later became the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs. After the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-1849) more Punjabis began to be recruited into the Bengal Army, forming regiments such as the 1st Bengal Military Police Battalion, which later became the 45th Rattray's Sikhs. Sikh units generally remained loyal to the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in which many regiments of the Bengal Army (which mainly recruited from Bengal, Bihar and Awadh) mutinied against their British officers. After the rebellion, troops from Bihar and Awadh were recruited less as they had led the mutiny; the centre of recruitment then shifted to the Punjab and the North-West Frontier, resulting in more Sikhs being recruited into the Bengal Army. A number of new Sikh regiments were raised, such as the 36th Sikhs and 35th Sikhs, both raised in 1887. 21 soldiers of the 36th Sikhs fought in the Battle of Saragarhi against 6,000-10,000 Pashtun tribesmen in 1897 during campaigns in the North-West Frontier, in what is considered by some military historians as one of history's greatest last stands. In 1922 the Indian government reformed the British Indian Army by amalgamating single battalion regiments into multi- battalion regiments; this led to the formation of the 11th Sikh Regiment from the 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs, the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs, the 45th Rattray's Sikhs, the 36th Sikhs, the 47th Sikhs, and the 35th Sikhs. The 11th Sikh Regiment served during World War II and on the partition of India, the regiment was allotted to the newly formed Indian Army, becoming the Sikh Regiment. As part of the British Indian Army, Sikh regiments fought in numerous wars all over the world, such as the Second Opium War in China, the Second Anglo-Afghan War, many campaigns on the North-West Frontier, the Western Front, Gallipoli and Mesopotamia campaigns of the First World War, the Third Anglo-Afghan War, and the North African, Italian and Burma campaigns of the Second World War, earning many gallantry awards and battle honours in the process. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948, the 1st battalion of the Sikh Regiment was the first unit to be airlifted to Srinagar to aid in the defence of the Kashmir Valley against Pakistani irregular forces. Battalions of the Sikh Regiment also fought in the Sino-Indian War in 1962, the Indo- Pakistani wars of 1965 and 1971, and the Kargil War in 1999. Recruitment Sikh regiment is a \\"single class\\" regiment. Its soldiers are solely recruited from Jat Sikhs and its officers are non-Jat Sikhs. They trained in the Sikh Regimental Centre, currently located in Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand. The war cry of the regiment, taken from Sikh scriptures, is Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal.

Early life and education Born Samuel Lazar to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, he graduated from Fordham University and Brooklyn Law School in 1931. While practicing bankruptcy law during the early 1930s, he negotiated a business deal for a vaudeville performer Ted Lewis, and realized the income potential for acting as an agent. Career Lazar moved to Hollywood in 1936 but maintained a presence in New York until after World War II when he moved to Los Angeles permanently. After putting together three major deals for Humphrey Bogart in a single day, he was dubbed \\"Swifty\\" by Bogart, a nickname he disliked. In addition to Bogart, Lazar became the agent representing other celebrities, including Lauren Bacall, Truman Capote, Cher, Joan Collins, No√´l Coward, Ira Gershwin, Cary Grant, Moss Hart, Ernest Hemingway, Gene Kelly, Madonna, Walter Matthau, Larry McMurtry, Vladimir Nabokov, Clifford Odets, Cole Porter, William Saroyan, Irwin Shaw, President Richard Nixon and Tennessee Williams. Lazar's power became such that he could negotiate a deal for someone who was not even his client and then collect a fee from that person's agent. Oscar Levant said of Lazar, \\"Everybody who matters has two agents: his own and Irving Lazar.\\" During World War II, Lazar, with Benjamin Landis, suggested to the U.S. Army Air Forces that it produce a play to encourage enlistment and to raise funds for the Army Emergency Relief Fund. The Air Forces commanding general, Henry H. Arnold, agreed and the play Winged Victory was written by Moss Hart and produced by Hart and Lazar. It was a huge success, playing on Broadway and on tour around the U.S. for over a million people. A film version was produced during the same period. During the 1950s Lazar expanded from Hollywood deal-making to doing book publishing deals. Lazar was an executive producer (with Bernie Brillstein) of John G. Avildsen's Neighbors (1981), starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, and he was an associate producer on two television miniseries, The Thorn Birds (1983) and Robert Kennedy & His Times (1985). Simon & Schuster editor-in-chief Michael Korda wrote a 1993 New Yorker profile of Lazar, later incorporated into Korda's book, Another Life: A Memoir of Other People (Random House, 1999). Korda gave this description of his first view of Lazar, \\"The person in question was standing on the other side of the pool, an incongruous, diminutive figure among all the half-naked, oiled, and bronzed bodies. He was totally bald, and his face--what could be seen of it below huge, glittering gold-rimmed Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses--was tanned, like his pate, to the color of a well-cared-for crocodile handbag. He was wearing tiny white shoes, a blue blazer with gold buttons, and white trousers pressed so perfectly, despite the heat, that he looked like a shiny, expensive beach toy that had just been unpacked by some lucky child. He was shouting into a telephone.\\"  Notable clients  * Cary Grant * Cher * Clifford Odets * Cole Porter * Dominque LaPierre * Ernest Hemingway * Garson Kanin * Gene Kelly * Humphrey Bogart * Ira Gershwin * Irwin Shaw * Joan Collins * Larry Collins * Larry McMurtry * Lauren Bacall * Madonna * Moss Hart * No√´l Coward * Richard Nixon * Tennessee Williams * Truman Capote * Vladimir Nabokov * Walter Matthau * William Saroyan Death Lazar died in 1993, aged 86, from complications stemming from diabetes, which had cut off circulation to his feet. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Lazar, who was being treated at home via peritoneal dialysis, refused. This refusal hastened Lazar's death.The death certificate states \\"Imminent Cause: Chronic Renal Failure due to Glomerulo Sclerosis due to Hypertension. Other significant conditions contributing to death but not related to cause given in 21 [above]: lower extremities diabetes.\\" Death Certificate, Los Angeles Department of Health Services He was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles next to his wife, Mary Van Nuys, who had died in January that same year from liver cancer. Legacy In 1988, a party was thrown for Lazar at a nightclub where Chazz Palminteri, then a struggling actor, was working as a bouncer. Lazar tried to enter and was stopped by Palminteri who didn't know him. Lazar got him fired, which led the broke (and now out of work) actor to write something for himself to star in since he wasn't being offered anything, and he was inspired to write A Bronx Tale. At the time of his death, Lazar was working on his autobiography, Swifty: My Life and Good Times, which was completed by Annette Tapert and published by Simon & Schuster in 1995. Swifty Lazar appears as a character in Peter Morgan's stage play Frost/Nixon, first staged at the Donmar Warehouse, London on August 10, 2006 and played by actor Kerry Shale. In the play, Lazar negotiates a deal with David Frost on behalf of President Richard Nixon for Frost to interview Nixon. The play is closely based on real-life events. He was also portrayed by Toby Jones in the 2008 film version of Frost/Nixon. Swifty Lazar also appeared, thinly disguised as Irving \\"Sneaky\\" LaSalle, in George Axelrod's 1956 take on Dr. Faustus, the play Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? where Sneaky as an agent, will get his clients absolutely anything they want for 10% of their soul. The Lazar role was played on Broadway by Martin Gable. Lazar was parodied on The Muppet Show as Fozzie Bear's agent, Irving Bizarre, who was so short that he appeared only as a top hat atop a pair of shoes.

Old vine (, ), a common description on wine labels, indicates that a wine is the product of grape vines that are notably old. There is a general belief that older vines, when properly handled, will give a better wine. There is no legal or generally agreed definition for old. Usage Grape vines can grow for over 120 years. After about 20 years vines start to produce smaller crops, and average yields decrease, leading to more concentrated, intense wines. Diseases such as \\"dead arm\\" can also afflict old vines, in some cases further concentrating the juice. \\"Old vines\\" might apply to an entire estate, or it might mean only a certain parcel planted before others. In the U.S., the most common use is on Zinfandel, because in California vineyards up to 125 years old are still bearing small amounts of prized Zinfandel fruit. In a place where wine production is longstanding, it often means a wine whose vines are thirty to forty years old. Some wine makers insist the vines should be older than this. In newly established wine regions, twenty years might be old. The definition is further complicated by the fact that certain varieties simply do not have economically viable yields when they get truly ancient.

It was transplanted under the direction of Lancelot Capability Brown to its current site in 1768. The variety is ‚ÄòSchiava Grossa‚Äô (also called Black Hamburg, or Trollinger). Contrary to the normal expectation for old vines, it produced its largest crop ever in autumn of 2001, of 383 kilograms (845 lbs). In the Barossa Valley, the world's oldest continually producing commercial vineyard that has been authenticated is believed to be the Shiraz vines at Turkey Flat in Tanunda that were originally planted in 1847.G.

Legal definition An Alsatian Riesling with the words \\"Old Vines\\" designated on the label. Because there is no objective definition, an \\"old vines\\" wine might or might not show any specific characteristics related to vine age. Generally, the more reputable the producer, the more likely it is to have veracity. Similarly, if a producer sells a \\"regular\\" and \\"old vines\\" bottling, it is more likely to represent a perceptible difference in character, if not necessarily in quality. In these ways, \\"old vines\\" is similar to \\"reserve,\\" a term that also varies dramatically in its significance and in many countries and regions has no legal definition.

As early as the 1960s, officials identified the US 93 route over Hoover Dam to be dangerous and inadequate for projected traffic volumes. From 1998‚Äì2001, officials from Arizona, Nevada, and several federal government agencies collaborated to determine the best routing for an alternative river crossing. In March 2001, the Federal Highway Administration selected the route, which crosses the Colorado River approximately downstream of Hoover Dam. Construction of the bridge approaches began in 2003, and construction of the bridge itself began in February 2005. The bridge was completed in 2010 and the entire bypass route opened to vehicle traffic on October 19, 2010. The Hoover Dam Bypass project was completed within budget at a cost of $240 million; the bridge portion cost $114 million. The bridge was the first concrete-steel composite arch bridge built in the United States,http://www.mtnmouse.com/nevada/hoover_dam_bridge.html and incorporates the widest concrete arch in the Western Hemisphere. At above the Colorado River, it is the second highest bridge in the United States after the Royal Gorge Bridge near Ca√±on City, Colorado, and is the world's highest concrete arch bridge.http://highestbridges.com/wiki/index.php?title=Mike_O'Callaghan- Pat_Tilman_Memorial_Bridge History In 1935, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, later AASHTO) authorized a southward extension of U.S. Route 93 from its previous southern terminus in Glendale, Nevada to Kingman, Arizona by way of Las Vegas and Boulder City, crossing the Colorado River on the newly constructed Hoover Dam (also known then as Boulder Dam). Clark County was sparsely populated at the time, with a population of less than 9,000 at the 1930 U.S. Census (compared to an estimated 2 million in 2013). Development in and around Las Vegas in the latter half of the 20th century made Las Vegas and its surrounding area a tourist attraction, and US 93 became an important transportation corridor for passenger and commercial traffic between Las Vegas and Phoenix. In 1995, the portion of US 93 over Hoover Dam was included as part of the CANAMEX Corridor, a high-priority transportation corridor established under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This bridge is a key component of the proposed Interstate 11 project. Through traffic on US 93 combined with pedestrian and tourist traffic at Hoover Dam itself led to major traffic congestion on the dam and on the approaches to the dam. The approaches featured hairpin turns on both the Nevada and Arizona sides of the dam, and the terrain caused limited sight distances around curves. In addition to traffic safety considerations, officials were also concerned about the safety and security of Hoover Dam, specifically the impact a vehicle accident could have on the dam's operation and the waters of Lake Mead. Officials first discussed the need for a new Colorado River crossing that would bypass the dam in the 1960s. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dam, began work on the \\"Colorado River Bridge Project\\" in 1989, but the project was put on hold in 1995. In 1997 the Federal Highway Administration took over the project and released a draft environmental impact statement in 1998. From 1998‚Äì2001 state officials from Arizona and Nevada as well as several federal government agencies studied the feasibility of several alternative routes and river crossings, as well as the feasibility of modifying the roadway over the dam, restricting traffic over the dam, or doing nothing. In March 2001, the Federal Highway Administration issued a Record of Decision indicating its selection of the \\"Sugarloaf Mountain Alternative\\" routing. The project called for approximately of highway in Nevada, of highway in Arizona, and a bridge length of that would cross the river downstream (south) of Hoover Dam. Design work began in July 2001. Security measures implemented following the September 11 attacks prohibited commercial truck traffic from driving across Hoover Dam. Prior to the completion of the bridge, commercial vehicles were required to follow a detour between Boulder City and Kingman via US 95, Nevada State Route 163, the Colorado River crossing between Laughlin, Nevada and Bullhead City, Arizona, and Arizona State Route 68. The detour was long, but only added to the normal journey on US 93. Design The completed bridge viewed from the Nevada side in December 2010 Project design was by the Hoover Support team, led by HDR, Inc. and including T.Y. Lin International, Sverdrup Civil, Inc., and other specialist contributors. The bridge has a length of and a span. The roadway is above the Colorado River and four lanes wide. This is the first concrete-and- steel composite arch bridge built in the United States. It includes the widest concrete arch in the Western Hemisphere and is also the second highest bridge in the nation, with the arch above the river. The twin arch ribs are connected by steel struts. The composite design, using concrete for the arch and columns with steel construction for the roadway deck, was selected for schedule and cost control while being aesthetically compatible with the Hoover Dam. Sean Holstege in The Arizona Republic has called the bridge \\"an American triumph\\". USA Today called it \\"America's Newest Wonder\\" on October 18, 2010. Pedestrian access is provided over the bridge to tourists who wish to take in a different view of the nearby dam and river below, but the dam is not visible for those driving across it. A parking area is provided near the bridge on the Nevada side at what was a staging area during construction. A set of stairs and disabled access ramps lead to the sidewalk across the bridge. View from Hoover Dam Construction The bridge under construction, January 2009 Work began in 2003 on the approaches in both states and the construction contract for the arch bridge was awarded in October 2004. The largest obstacle to the project was the river crossing. The bridge and the bypass were constructed by a consortium of different government agencies and contractors, among them the Federal Highway Administration, the Arizona Department of Transportation, and Nevada Department of Transportation, with RE Monks Construction and Vastco, Inc, constructing the Arizona Approach, Edward Kraemer & Sons, Inc, the Nevada Approach and Las Vegas Paving Corporation undertaking the roadway surfacing on both approaches. The bridge itself was built by Obayashi Corporation and PSM Construction USA, Inc., while Frehner Construction Company, Inc. was responsible for completing the final roadway installations. A permit problem between Clark County and the subcontractor Casino Ready Mix arose in May 2006 over the operation of a concrete-batch plant for the project, and this caused a four-month delay. Construction of the arches, showing the diagonal cable stays and the high-line crane. June 2009 Construction required hoisting workers and up to of materials above the Colorado River using -long steel cables held aloft by a \\"high-line\\" crane system. High winds caused a cableway failure in September 2006, resulting in a further two-year delay. The approach spans, consisting of seven pairs of concrete columns‚Äîfive on the Nevada side and two on the Arizona side‚Äîwere completed in March 2008. In November 2008, construction worker Sherman Jones died in an accident. Completed arch in September 2009 The arches are made of 106 pieces‚Äî53 per arch‚Äîmostly cast in place sections. The arch was constructed from both sides of the bridge concurrently, supported by diagonal cable stays strung from temporary towers. The twin arch spans were completed with the casting of the center segments in August 2009. That same month, the two halves of the arch were completed, and were apart; the gap was filled with a block of reinforced concrete. The temporary cable stays were removed, leaving the arch self-supporting. By December, all eight of the vertical piers on the arch had been set and capped, and at the end of the month the first two of thirty-six steel girders had been set into place. The nearly complete bridge seen from a helicopter in February 2010 By mid-April 2010, all of the girders were set in place, and for the first time construction crews could walk across the structure from Arizona to Nevada. Shortly thereafter, the pouring of the bridge deck began. The bridge deck was fully paved in July, and the high-line cranes were removed from the site as the overall project neared completion. The bridge was completed with a dedication ceremony on October 14, 2010. and a grand opening party on October 16. It was opened to bicycle and pedestrian traffic on October 18 and to vehicular traffic on October 19, a few weeks earlier than estimated. The building of the bridge was featured in episode 5x02 of the TV series Extreme Engineering. The filming of this episode took place before the start of work on the arch. When the bridge opened to traffic, the roadway over Hoover Dam was closed to through traffic, and all visitor access to the dam was routed to the Nevada side; vehicles are still allowed to drive across the dam to the Arizona side following a security inspection, but must return to the Nevada side to return to US 93. The former US 93 route between the dam and its junction with the present US 93 route has been re-designated as Nevada State Route 172. The highway using the bridge was given the added designation of Interstate 11 in 2018, after the completion of the Boulder City freeway bypass. Naming In late 2004, the proposed bridge name honoring Mike O'Callaghan and Pat Tillman was announced at a ceremony by the Governor of Nevada, Kenny Guinn, and the Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano. O‚ÄôCallaghan, a decorated Korean War veteran, was the Governor of Nevada from 1971 through 1979, and he was the executive editor at the Las Vegas Sun newspaper for many years until his death on March 5, 2004. Tillman had been a football player for Arizona State University and for the Arizona Cardinals. He gave up his multimillion-dollar career in the National Football League to enlist as an infantryman in the U.S. Army, but he was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan on April 22, 2004. Incidents View from upstream of Hoover Dam with Mike O'Callaghan‚ÄìPat Tillman Memorial Bridge in background Construction crane collapse Strong winds gusting across the Black Canyon on September 15, 2006, appear to have been the cause for the collapse of the \\"high-line\\" crane system that was used to carry workmen and materials at the bridge site. No injuries or fatalities occurred because of this accident. Limited construction work resumed in October 2006, but this accident caused a two-year delay in construction. The bridge-construction companies Obayashi Corp. and PSM Construction, USA, Inc. absorbed the cost of the debris removal and the rebuilding of the cranes. The reconstruction contract for the cranes was awarded to Cincinnati's F&M; Mafco Inc. Fatalities Work was halted when a Las Vegas construction worker, 48-year-old Sherman Jones, was killed. A jack punctured his chest during construction while adjusting a cable used to align temporary concrete towers. Suicides The first known suicide at the bridge took place on April 7, 2012. Federal officials were unable to persuade the victim not to jump from the pedestrian walkway overlooking the dam. Others have happened since. Representatives of the Nevada Department of Transportation \\"are constantly monitoring the situation,\\" and were \\"planning to discuss potential preventative measures on the bypass bridge\\" at their August or September 2012 meeting.

They can be up to 40 cm long (including the tail), are considered a pest in the cereal crops and gardens of India and Sri Lanka, and emit piglike grunts when attacking. The name bandicoot is derived from the Telugu language word pandikokku, which translates loosely to \\"pig- rat\\".Yule, Henry, Sir (New ed. edited by William Crooke, B.A.) (1903) Hobson- Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive. J. Murray, London. online Like the better known rats in the genus Rattus, bandicoot rats are members of the family Muridae. Their fur is dark or (rarely) pale brown dorsally, occasionally blackish, and light to dark grey ventrally. The head-body length is around 250 mm, and the uniformly dark tail is shorter than the head-body length. Description The lesser bandicoot and two other species are nocturnal or most active at twilight. They construct burrows to nest and bear their litters. The number of bandicoot babies can range from two to 18. Their staple diet is grains, fruit, and invertebrates. They are prone to destroying cultivated crops in fields. Of all the three species, the lesser bandicoot is an especially aggressive burrower and has been reported to make tunnels in concrete cellars. These are one of several animals called chuchundra in the Nepali language. In Sri Lanka, the bandicoot rat is known as heen uru-meeya ‡∑Ñ‡∑ì‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂å‡∂ª‡∑î ‡∂∏‡∑ì‡∂∫‡∑è in Sinhala language, the meaning of which directly translates to \\"lesser pig-rat\\". Habitat These rats are also known to inhabit houses in villages and are particularly aggressive when threatened. The controls are done by mechanical (mouse trap etc.), rodenticides and biological control (by introducing rodent diseases etc.) Reproduction Female can have up to 10 litters. Young (10-12 per litter) are born blind and naked. Young reach sexual maturity around 60 days after birth. Lifespan of adults is about 8‚Äì9 months. Ecology Commonly, it lives in cultivated plains and gardens and is one of the most destructive pests to crops and cultivation. It digs burrows with characteristic pile of earth around the entrance, hence its name. The burrow system is extensive and elaborate, consisting of numerous chambers (sleeping, storing, etc.), galleries and exits or 'bolt-holes', which are covered with loose earth, facilitating an easy escape during emergencies. The storage chambers are stocked with large amounts of grain, specially during harvest time. Usually, one mole-rat is found in one burrow, except when a mother is with young. It has a habit of erecting its long guard hairs scattered over the back and emitting harsh grunts when disturbed. As a vector It is a carrier of and spreads many diseases such as; * Plague * Murine typhus * Leptospirosis * Salmonellosis * Rat bite fever Susceptibility to drugs Warfarin is a first-generation anticoagulant that relies on multiple feeding events to achieve lethality in susceptible rodents. The majority of lesser bandicoot rats are highly susceptible to warfarin, where according to one experiment, one female animal has survived a high dose of active ingredient (79.1 mg kg-1). Triptolide has been reported to cause sterility in male rats and mice. Triptolide treatment affected the histomorphology of the uterus of these rats by causing a decrease in lumen and columnar cell height and number of uterine glands and ovary by increasing the number of atretic follicles and decreasing the number of developing follicles. Lesser bandicoot rats appear to be averse to scilliroside at all concentrations in food baits. Maximum mortality attained on free-choice feeding on scilliroside is 90% among the individuals.

Maharbal was a very close friend to Hannibal and admired him greatly.\\"Battle of Cannae.\\" World at War: Understanding Conflict and Society, ABC-CLIO, 2019, worldatwar-abc-clio-swb.orc.scoolaid.net/Search/Display/1559815. Accessed 11 Sept. 2019. He was often critical to the battlefield success of Carthage over Rome. Throughout his Italian campaign Hannibal maintained numerical superiority in cavalry, and thus relied upon them and Maharbal to give his army an advantage. Maharbal is best known for what he possibly said during a conversation with Hannibal immediately following the Battle of Cannae. According to Livy, Maharbal strongly urged an immediate march on the city of Rome. Hannibal responded by saying \\"I commend your zeal, but I need time to weigh the plan which you propose.\\" \\"Maharbal then replied, \\"Assuredly, no one man has been blessed with all God's gifts. You, Hannibal, know how to gain a victory; you do not know how to use it.\\"Livy, The History of Rome 22.51 The Latin for the last sentence of the conversation is: \\"Vincere scis, Hannibal; victoria uti nescis.\\"  Military accomplishments  Maharbal was a son of Himilco. He was first mentioned as commanding the besieging force at the siege of Saguntum (219 BC) in the absence of the commander-in-chief Hannibal. According to Livy, he carried on the operations with such vigour that Hannibal's absence was hardly felt. After Hannibal arrived in Italy, he was sent with a body of cavalry to ravage the plains near the Po in northern Italy. He was recalled to join his commander for the battle on the Ticinus (218 BC) where the consul Publius Cornelius Scipio was seriously wounded and his son, Scipio Africanus, first made an appearance in Roman history. Battle of Lake Trasimene (217 BC) At Lake Trasimene, 6000 Romans who had escaped from the battle occupied a strong position in one of the neighbouring villages. These survivors were induced to lay down their arms, on receiving from Maharbal a promise of safety. Hannibal, however, refused to ratify the capitulation, alleging that Maharbal had exceeded his powers. He dismissed, without ransom, all those men who belonged to the Italian allies, and only retained the Roman citizens as prisoners of war.Polyb. iii. 84, 85; Liv. xxii. 6, 7; Appian, Annib. 10. Maharbal, despite being a cavalry commander, led Iberian skirmishers and infantry to round up the Romans who had survived the battle. The consul Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, who was en route to meet with his co-consul Gaius Flaminius, had sent his cavalry ahead, led by the praetor Gaius Centenius. After the battle of Trasimene, Maharbal (leading a detachment of spear-men and cavalry) successfully intercepted Centinius and his detachment of 4000 cavalry. When Maharbal's force met with Centenius half of the Romans were killed, and the rest retreated. The surviving Roman cavalry were followed to a hill where they eventually surrendered.Polyb. iii. 86; Liv. xxii. 8; Appian, Annib. 11. After this battle, Maharbal was apparently sent with the Numidian cavalry to ravage the rich Falernian plains. Battle of Cannae (216 BC) Maharbal's role in this famous battle is uncertain. Roman historians are themselves divided over his presence or absence, and the most reliable of them, Polybius, does not mention his presence at all. According to Livy, Maharbal commanded the right wing of the Carthaginian army at the battle of Cannae, contradicting Polybius's claim that the right wing was commanded by Hanno, son of Bomilcar. Appian agrees with Polybius, however, and assigns Maharbal on that occasion the command of the reserve of cavalry instead. Livy claims that immediately after the victory, Maharbal urged Hannibal to push on at once with his cavalry upon Rome itself, promising him that if he did so, within five days he should sup in the Capitol. On the refusal of his commander to do so, Maharbal is said to have observed that Hannibal knew indeed how to gain victories, but not how to use them.Liv. xxii. 13, 46, 51; Appian, Annib. 20, 21; Floras, ii. 5; Zonar. ix. 1; Cato ap. Gell. x. 24; Plutarch, Fab. 17, erroneously assigns this advice to a Carthaginian of the name of Barca. However, modern historians judge Hannibal's decision more reasonably than did William Smith and his contemporaries. They point to the fact that Hannibal's army was exhausted, that Rome was able to raise fresh legions, that Rome itself was defended by formidable walls, and that Hannibal had no siege machinery. After Cannae Maharbal's fate after the Battle of Casilinum,Liv. xxiii. 18 is not known. A person of that name is mentioned by FrontinusStrateg. ii. 5. ¬ß 12 as employed by the Carthaginians against some African tribes that had rebelled. However, it is not clear if this is the same Maharbal as Hannibal's cavalry commander. He may have died around the time of the siege of Casilinum, or shortly thereafter.

He is most well known as the author of several books analysing J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. He writes a weblog called Hogwarts Professor, and contributes to podcasts on Mugglenet.  Education  Granger was born in Corning, New York and grew up in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and the University of Chicago, where he studied classical languages and literature. Granger has a Master of Fine Arts (Creative Writing) from Oklahoma City University and is currently writing his PhD thesis at Swansea University (Wales). Previously he taught Latin and English at The Asheville School, Peninsula College, and Valley Forge Military Academy. Granger served for 6 years in the US Marine Corps including postings at the Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms, California, and at Camp Butler, Okinawa, Japan. He is married to Mary, is a reader in the Orthodox Church, and has seven children.  Focus  Described as \\"The Dean of Harry Potter Scholars\\" his specialisation is iconological literary criticism, reading at four layers: the surface, moral, allegorical, and sublime (anagogical). Writing about Harry Potter from this perspective, he introduced the 'Eliade thesis' to suggest a textual cause for Potter mania explaining Rowling's use of Christian Symbolism and Rowling's use of literary alchemy. Granger has demonstrated Rowling's use of 'ring composition' or chiasmus story scaffolding and eye symbolism in the Harry Potter novels, and argued that her eye symbolism in Deathly Hallows and the King's Cross scene Rowling describes as \\"the key\\" to the seven novels suggests her baseline theme is \\"transformed vision\\". Granger brings the same literary criticism model to the allegorical and anagogical aspects of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga, Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy and C. S. Lewis‚Äô Chronicles of Narnia. He has been a featured speaker at Harry Potter conferences in Orlando, Las Vegas, Toronto, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Illinois, San Francisco, Chicago, Chestnut Hill, Washington, D.C., St Andrews and Ottawa in addition to giving talks and classes on symbolist literature and iconological criticism at schools and other venues around the US. Granger has been a guest speaker at the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University, California, Pepperdine, Washington & Lee, La Salle, Cornell, Penn, Yale, University of Chicago, Baylor, St Andrews, the Wade Center at Wheaton College, Loyola, Augustana, UNC, USC, the New York C. S. Lewis Society, New York Public Library, and the Past Watchful Dragons C. S. Lewis Conference. He has given more than 100 radio, newspaper, and television interviews and is featured in the A&E; Special 'Secrets of Harry Potter' that is an Order of the Phoenix DVD Extra.http://www.familystorytelling.net/2006/06/harry-potter-ii-interview- with-john.html  Criticism  In respect to the Harry Potter series, Granger holds, contrary to several Christian critics of the series ‚Äì including Berit Kjos and Richard Abanes ‚Äì that the books' magic is incantational rather than invocational, and, as such, require and support a Christian worldview rather than undermine it. Granger has debated Abanes and Catholic Potter critic Michael O‚ÄôBrien on the Christian content and value of Rowling's work. This argument was later validated by Rowling in her 2007 Open Book Tour, when she commented that she thought the Christian symbolism and content of the Harry Potter novels was \\"obvious\\". Latter-day Saint critics of Granger's exploration of Stephanie Meyers‚Äô Mormonism and its place in her Twilight novels have dismissed his work as a cursory engagement with Mormonism, uncovering subtlety where none was intended, giving Meyer the benefit of doubts never demanded, and getting Mormon popular culture plain wrong. Granger has been defended by BYU Professor Steven Walker, who Stephanie Meyer has cited as the professor who had the greatest influence on her. Walker, who is also a believing Mormon, has commented that Granger has persuaded him that \\"Meyer‚Äôs religious thought is so crucial to her fiction that to read it without consideration of the theology is to miss much of the point\\", and that Granger's work succeeds in deepening Christian's reading of theology, showing that readers enter fully into the stories because of religious depths and heights which the Twilight novels share with the best English literature. Works about Harry Potter Granger first became interested in Harry Potter when his daughter was given a copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He read the book with the intention of pointing out to his daughter what was wrong with it but instead was impressed by the Christian imagery, classical references, and 'acerbic criticism of muggledom'. Granger's interest grew through discussion with friends in the Port Townsend C. S. Lewis Society. He gave lectures on the subject at the Society and the town's Carnegie Library which lectures were eventually collected into a book, 'Hidden Key to Harry Potter' (Zossima Press, 2002). That book was re-written and re-titled first 'Looking for God in Harry Potter' (Tyndale, 2004, 2006) and now 'How Harry Cast His Spell' (Tyndale, 2008). This book in its updated and revised forms argues that the Harry Potter novels are as popular as they are because of their traditional symbolism and spiritual content. Granger believes, following Mircea Eliade, that because forms of entertainment in a secular or profane culture serve a mythic and religious function; the most popular works will be those with transcendent imagery, structure, and meaning. Granger taught Harry Potter courses on the online Barnes and Noble University and as a guest in their Book Clubs from 2004 to 2007. He has also appeared as a guest in favor of the Harry Potter books on several radio and TV shows, including CNN's Paula Zahn Now, MSNBC, and A&E;'s The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter (which special is on the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix DVD). Having been the first to note and explain the traditional alchemical and Christian imagery in the novels, he has become involved in the debate with those who criticize Ms. Rowling's novels, critics who believe the adventure stories encourage children to consider paganism and witchcraft as alternative faiths. In The Deathly Hallows Lectures, he explains the predominant eye symbolism of the series finale in light of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's natural theology and the consequent tradition of eye and mirror symbolism in Romantic literature.

Amelia developed from a tropical wave that moved through the Atlantic Ocean uneventfully. The disturbance then entered an area of the Gulf of Mexico that was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis and became the first tropical depression of the season, after which it was forecast to make landfall before any significant intensification. However, the tropical depression defied predictions, quickly strengthening into a weak tropical storm just hours before making landfall in Corpus Christi. The storm lasted roughly a day over land before becoming unidentifiable after being active for just under 48 hours. After dissipating, the storm caused a severe flooding disaster in Texas. Amelia affected the Texas coast for two days which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in from as far away as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33 fatalities with an estimated $110 million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward through the Atlantic Ocean for the next week with no change in development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection began to come together two days later due to the influence of anticyclonic flow. The disturbance passed the Yucatan Peninsula on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however. On July 30, the disturbance turned to the northwest and entered an area of the Gulf with slightly above normal sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear, which favored further development. At this point, the presentation seen on satellite imagery had indicated that a tropical cyclone was beginning to form in the Gulf. After a reconnaissance aircraft went into the system, the cyclone was upgraded into the first tropical depression of the season that afternoon while south of Brownsville, Texas. When it formed, it was moving north-northwest at , which was thought at the time to inhibit further strengthening due to the depression moving onto land. Several hours later, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Amelia, a decision that one forecaster said was made to be on the safe side. Amelia peaked at in wind speed when it was upgraded, with the system beginning to skirt the Texas coast. At peak intensity, the storm had gale-force winds along a diameter of . Amelia, which never had a well-defined center, went up the coast during the afternoon and evening of July 30, making landfall in Corpus Christi the next day. The system was tracked until passing just west of San Antonio, where it became indiscernible after the morning of August 1. The storm was active for a short span of time -- just under two days -- forming and dissipating so quickly that, following the storm, there was some controversy about the reliability of the weather forecasters.  Preparations  While the storm was over water, small craft advisories were issued by the Coast Guard in addition to cautioning people on vacation in South Padre Island to avoid the beaches. However, as it was a Sunday evening, most of the ships were already coming into port. As Amelia approached the Texas coast, gale warnings were issued for the area from Brownsville to Port O'Connor on July 30. Due to it forming in close proximity to the coast, warnings were issued as soon as the storm was named. As the state had been in the midst of a severe drought the previous six weeks, there was hope that Amelia would relieve the dry conditions. However, the drought conditions would benefit the floods from the storm due to the ground being rendered so dry that it was unable to soak up all the rain from the storm.  Impact  The remnants of Amelia on August 3. Effects from Amelia as a tropical cyclone ranged from winds in Brownsville to gusts of up to in Corpus Christi. Inland Texas fared much worse, though. The continuous flow of tropical moisture during Amelia's dissipation and remnant stage brought heavy flooding for two to three days, putting 25 counties under flash flood warnings. The orographic effect of the Edwards Plateau enhanced the flooding, leading to rainfall totals as high as in a two-day period. Although the showers stretched into Dallas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, any damages from the storm in these areas are unknown. The final toll from the storm was 33 dead, most of which occurred a week after the storm made landfall, and $110 million in damage. Most of the damage was located in two specific areas: an area consisting of the towns of Albany and Graham, and the Texas Hill Country, although light flooding was reported elsewhere.  Gulf of Mexico and the Texas Coast  In coastal areas of Texas, damage was limited to the sinking of several shrimp boats and the beaching of sail boats. One ship -- the Mermaid of the Sea -- was caught in the middle of the storm. Although it sank, its crew was rescued. A pleasure boat with three occupants and the two-man crew of a beached catamaran were all reported missing, but were later found. Three other people on board a fishing vessel were treated for exposure. Rescue ships were hampered by anchored Mexican boats and surfers in a channel near the Coast Guard station. According to the Coast Guard, all nine ships that had been reported missing in the storm were later accounted for. Along with the ships, an oil drilling rig in the Gulf was ripped from its location and ran aground near Matagorda Island by the storm. The 19 crew members of the rig were rescued by helicopter. As the rig had not yet begun drilling, there was no threat from an oil spill. In Port Isabel, there was some flooding on the southeast part of the town which was alleviated when some of the manhole covers were opened. In addition, a tornado was thought to have touched down, causing minor damage. South Padre Island reported power outages after receiving over of rain and the Queen Isabella Causeway was rendered nearly impassable due to rainfall. During its time as a tropical cyclone, there were no deaths linked to Amelia.  Northern Texas  The town of Albany was hit hard when the town drainage system and Hubbard Creek both flooded. The ensuing torrent destroyed 25-30 houses and a dozen businesses and damaged hundreds more while inundating 80% of the town. In addition, all incoming roads were flooded, the pavement on U.S. Route 283 was washed away, and a bridge on U.S. Route 180 buckled, preventing anyone from entering or leaving on land. The town's water supply was contaminated and the electricity and communications were also knocked out. The death toll from Albany was set at nine dead and twelve missing, although the town sheriff said that four people who were missing would likely never be found due to several cave-ins along the creek, possibly burying them up to deep in mud. Rescue efforts here were hampered by overflowing creeks and a lack of communication. The rain was also responsible for carving a deep hole in an earthen dam at nearby Lake Throckmorton, but the water from the dam was safely taken up by a nearby creek. The town of Throckmorton itself was completely evacuated and, like Albany, had its fresh water supply contaminated. North of Albany, the Brazos River also flooded, with the Clear Fork Brazos River becoming wide at one point, despite normally being a dry creek bed. The Brazos overflowing, in addition to the flooding of the nearby Salt Creek, resulted in the west side of Graham -- the county seat of Young County where flood victims from Eliasville and South Bend had taken shelter -- becoming flooded over to within blocks of the Young County Courthouse. Later, the flood waters were reported to have entered the basement of the courthouse. Effects from the flooding in Graham ranged from 150 houses and 40-50 businesses being inundated to the loss of water and electrical utilities. No fatalities were reported, however, due to the water levels rising gradually, leaving time for residents to evacuate. The crest of the Brazos flood then headed for the Possum Kingdom Lake with a threat of lowland flooding, resulting in evacuations of riverside towns in Parker and Palo Pinto counties, although a report from Palo Pinto said that no flooding was expected. The flooding was alleviated at the Possum Kingdom Lake, as the lake was already down from normal and some of the floodgates there were opened, taking most of the water from the flood. Elm Creek, near Abilene, also swelled, flooding into the town, but the only reported damage there was street flooding. An additional death was reported in the town of Morse.  Southern Texas  Amelia's Rainfall Totals in Texas The hardest hit area during the storm was the Guadalupe River basin and its tributaries. A sign of the oncoming problem was a wall of water witnessed cascading down the Leona River in Uvalde. Like with Graham, Uvalde was ultimately flooded up to a block away from the courthouse. The Guadalupe River became heavily flooded, rising in one hour. The rapid rise covered a bridge on U.S. Route 281, north of San Antonio and prompted evacuations in a area near the flood plains. The overflowing river was responsible for ten total deaths in Kendall and Kerr Counties and submerging Comfort under seven feet of water, killing four people there. The towns of Welfare and Center Point were also reported to be flooded. In nearby Hunt, a group of military personnel who entered the region to assist with rescues got stranded themselves. After receding, the Guadalupe steadily became filled again, prompting re-evacuations. Near Stonewall, the Pedernales overflowed its banks, covering the area in up to of water and swamping the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. The only overflow to emanate from Mexico was from the Rio Conchos, which dumped its overflowing water into the Rio Grande and subsequently damaged the international bridge between Mexico and the United States in Presidio. The worst impact was confined to Bandera County. The impact in the county stemmed from flooding of the Medina River which, infused with high rainfall, produced a 500-year flood. In Bandera, the Medina turned into a wall of water, which destroyed several of the trees along the river in addition to causing various items to litter the roads. In isolated areas, there was an odor from decaying livestock. Two people were witnessed clinging to a roof that was swept into the Medina. A further 100 people were cut off due to the river flood. 10‚Äì15 houses were washed away and the courthouse became an evacuation center by virtue of being the only area above the water. Electricity and all phone lines save the Sheriff Department line were knocked out in the city and several houses that were still standing had standing water inside them. At the riverfront Camp Bandina, eight people were reported killed while 100 children escaped by staying at the church camp nearby. The Peaceful Valley Ranch was nearly decimated, with only the building foundations still remaining. Six people were killed by the floods while sleeping while 20 guests and staff rode out the storm by clinging to trees and roofs for six hours. The town of Medina was rendered inaccessible by road after the Medina combined with the Sabinal River. There were also reports of looting in the county, but no arrests were made. One of the survivors of the flooding in this area was former Miss USA Kimberly Tomes, whose family was vacationing at a dude ranch in the area. After leaving and grabbing onto a tree, she witnessed cars and mobile homes passing by.  Aftermath  Following the storm, there was some controversy as to the nature of the storms. A cloud seeding project was underway near Albany only hours before the town was hit with flooding. However, the rains were determined to have been tropical in origin. At the request of Governor Dolph Briscoe, President Jimmy Carter declared Kendall, Kerr, and Bandera Counties as disaster areas, allowing citizens in these areas to receive federal aid. All three counties had previously been declared disaster areas due to the prior drought. Later, three more counties -- Young, Shackleford, and Haskell -- were added to the list. Briscoe described the disaster as one of the worst floods in the history of the state. Evacuation centers were set up in Kerrville, Comfort, and Center Point to allow refugees to wait out the floods. In Bandera, 300 people applied for relief and 200 mobile homes were sent to help the homeless. The cafeteria of the junior high school was used as both a morgue and a Red Cross emergency center. In Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped organize a relief effort for the Texas town of the same name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local supermarket chain. After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight was funded by the Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.  Records  Amelia and its remnants set several records for rainfall and flooding. The Medina River crested at , breaking the record for flood stage reached on the river that was set in 1919 at as well as breaking the record for water flow, or the rate in which water flows down the river, at 79 billion gallons per day. Additionally, the Brazos River had its highest flooding since 1957. Records were also set for flowing on the Guadalupe, which flowed at 149 billion gallons a day, more than twice the previous record and nearly 1500 times its usual rate of 100 million gallons per day. The storm total of measured at Medina was the wettest known storm total rainfall amount for both the state of Texas and any tropical cyclone impacting the continental United States until Hurricane Harvey in 2017. A 12-hour total of of rain at Abilene was an extreme example of the precipitation. In addition, with genesis occurring at a longitude of 97.0¬∞W Amelia holds the record for the westernmost formation of a tropical cyclone in the North Atlantic hurricane database, which dates back to 1851.

It lies north-west of Tehran on the main highway to Tabriz and Turkey and approximately from the Caspian Sea. The city is located about 20 kilometers south of the Qaflankuh Mountain Range. At the 2016 census, its population was 521,302 which is the 20th largest city in Iran. The population of Zanjan consists mostly of Iranian Azeris who can also speak the Azerbaijani language. Zanjan is 21733 square kilometers. Zanjan is known for its handcrafts such as knives, traditional sandals, called charoogh, and malileh, a handcraft made with silver wires. Zanjani artists make many things like various decorative dishes and their special covers as well as silver jewelry. In ancient times, Zanjan was known for its stainless and sharp knives. But this tradition is gradually becoming extinct by introduction of Chinese-made knives into the market which are far cheaper, more abundant and less artistic . Many villagers today are traditional carpet weavers. Zanjan's population boasts the highest level of happiness among the people of 30 other provinces in Iran, according to a detailed survey conducted by Isna. History Drawing by Eug√®ne Flandin Hamdollah Mostowfi, the Iranian traveler and historian, in his book claims that Zanjan was built by Ardashir I, the first king of the Sassanid Empire and named as \\"Shahin\\". One important moment in the history of the city was in 1851 when the city became a center for the suppressed Babi religious movement, along with Neyriz and a fortress known as Shaykh Tabarsi. The forces of the central government captured the Babi fort in Zanjan after a long siege on the orders of Grand Vizier (Prime Minister of Iran) Amir Kabir and killed or expelled the Bab's followers.Abdu'l-Bah√°, Edward Granville. \\"A Traveller's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the B√°b\\", Published by Kalimat Press, 2004, , According to Bosworth, who quotes Hamdollah Mostowfi, the inhabitants during the Ilkhanid era spoke \\"pure Pahlawi\\", a Median or northern form of Persian.Bosworth, C.E.,\\"Zanjan\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. 11:447. \\"... and also stated that the inhabitants spoke \\"pure Pahlawi\\", i.e. a Median or northern form of Persian\\" Geography According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, rainfed agriculture makes up around 42% of Zanjan's land cover and grasslands account for another 37%. The remainder is bareland, irrigated agriculture, forest, orchard and riverbanks. Only 1.07% of the land is urban development. Climate Zanjan has a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk) with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters, often with snowfall. Precipitation is very low, and mostly falls between October and May.

He principally wrote about the lives of the poor farmers and fishermen, both in his native Norway and among the Norwegian immigrants in the United States. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times. Biography Bojer was born Johan Kristoffer Hansen in the village of √òrkedals√∏ren, now the town of Orkanger, S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag county. The son of unmarried parents‚ÄîHans Christophersen Bojer and Johanna Iversdatter Elgaaen‚Äîhe grew up as a foster child in a poor family living in Rissa near Trondheim, Norway. Bojer learned early the realities of poverty. His early years were spent working on a farm and working as a bookkeeper. After the death of his father in 1894, he took the surname Bojer. His literary work began with the publication of Unge tanker in 1893, and continued to gather strength through the 1920s. Because of the range of topics he addressed, he won critical acclaim in Norway. He gained international fame after many of his works were published in foreign languages. Critics generally recognize his best work to be his novel, ', (English title: The Last of the Vikings). This novel powerfully and realistically depicts the lives of fishermen from Tr√∏ndelag, who spend the winter fishing in the Lofoten island archipelago within the Arctic Circle near the far north coast of Norway. Portrait of Johan Bojer, 1920, by Kahlil Gibran Bojer is best remembered for The Emigrants, a major novel dealing with the motivations and trials of Norwegians emigrated on the plains of North Dakota. In 1923, Bojer journeyed to Litchville, North Dakota, to research the lives of the Norwegian immigrants who had settled there.

Another road, departing from the village of Alajlanya, in the west, links Shibam to Mukalla, the governorate's capital, located by the Indian Ocean. Climate Shibam has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen: BWh). At an average temperature of , June is the hottest month of the year. January is the coldest month, with temperatures averaging . Architecture=Overview Shibam, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is known for its distinct architecture. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mud brick, and about 500 of them are tower blocks, which rise 5 to 11 storeys high, with each floor having one or two rooms. This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, most of the city's houses originate from the 16th century. Many, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries. Shibam is often called \\"the oldest skyscraper city in the world\\". It is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction.Old Walled City of Shibam, UNESCO World Heritage Centre The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud. The city is surrounded by a fortified wall, giving it the name \\"the walled city of Shibam\\". Threats The mudbrick buildings are frequently threatened by wind, rain, and heat erosion, and require constant upkeep in order to maintain their structures. The city was heavily affected by flooding from a tropical cyclone in 2008. The foundations of many of the buildings in the city were compromised by the flood waters, eventually leading to their collapse. It was also the target of an Al Qaeda attack in 2009. In 2015, Shibam was added to the list of World Heritage sites in Danger when violent civil war erupted in Yemen. Historic buildings were significantly damaged during heavy bombing in Sana'a, and remain at risk from armed conflict.

In addition to publishing monolingual dictionaries, Langenscheidt also publishes bilingual dictionaries and travel phrase-books. Langenscheidt has language-to-language dictionaries in many languages, including: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Greek, Ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic, Chinese and Croatian, and in varying sizes, ranging from small travel pocket dictionaries to large desk sized ones.  History  The Langenscheidt Publishing Group was founded on 1 October 1856 by Gustav Langenscheidt, in response to other publishers' refusal to publish his self-study materials for learning French, which he subsequently published under the title ‚Äû Unterrichtsbriefe zur Erlernung der franz√∂sischen Sprache‚Äú (\\"Teaching letters for learning the French language\\"). These learning materials became very popular and were widely read so much so that even today, Langenscheidt can be considered the \\"Father of distance education\\". From 1867, Langenscheidt Publishing Group had its own printing press. From 1869 Langenscheidt worked with Karl Sachs and C√©saire Villatte on the Encyklop√§disches franz√∂sisch-deutsches und deutsch-franz√∂sisches W√∂rterbuch (\\"Encyclopedic French-German and German-French dictionary\\") and published it in 1880. In 1874, Langenscheidt was awarded the title of professor. In 1891, in close collaboration with Eduard Muret and Daniel Sanders, he started working on the English equivalent, the Encyklop√§disches englisch-deutsches und deutsch-englisches W√∂rterbuch (\\"Encyclopedic English-German and German-English dictionary\\"). Langenscheidt did not live to see its publication; his son Carl, his successor, published it in 1901.  Dictionary structure  A 2015-printed Turkish to German (and vice versa) Langenscheidt dictionary with 55,000 words capacity The structure for most Langenscheidt dictionaries is the same. Most pocket dictionaries include around 55,000 references designed for tourists or people studying beginning or intermediate foreign languages, while larger desk sized interlanguage dictionaries include around 220,000 references. After the two languages' references conclude, grammatical assistance appears in the Appendix section, including helpful abbreviations, geographical regions, currency values, temperature conversions, and numerical values.

Plot In the village of Domr√©my, the young Joan is visited by Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, who exhort her to fight for her country. Her father Jacques d'Arc, mother Isabelle Rom√©e, and uncle beg her to stay at home, but she leaves them and travels to Vaucouleurs, where she meets with the governor, Captain Robert de Baudricourt. The dissipated Baudricourt initially scorns Joan's ideals, but her zeal eventually wins him over, and he gives her authority to lead French soldiers. Joan and her army lead a triumphal procession into Orl√©ans, followed by a large crowd. Then, in Reims Cathedral, Charles VII is crowned King of France. At the Siege of Compi√®gne, Joan is taken prisoner while her army attempts to storm the castle. In prison, Joan has another dream in which she sees her visions again. Taken to the interrogation, Joan refuses to sign a retraction, and is condemned as a heretic. In the Rouen marketplace, Joan is burned at the stake. The wood carrier at the execution, bringing in fuel for the burning, dies on the spot from the fumes. In a final apotheosis scene, Joan rises to heaven, where she is greeted by God and the saints. Cast *Jeanne Calvi√®re as Joan of Arc. Calvi√®re, a stablewoman at the Cirque d'Hiver, was hired for this film and remained among M√©li√®s's core troupe of actors for several years afterward. *Georges M√©li√®s in seven roles: Jeanne's father; Jeanne's uncle; Robert de Baudricourt; a beggar at the Orl√©ans procession; a soldier at the Siege of Compi√®gne; one of Joan's jailers; and the wood carrier at the execution. *Jeanne d'Alcy in three roles: Jeanne's mother; a lady at Vaucouleurs; and a lady at Orl√©ans. Production The surviving print of the film The film was made in the spring of 1900. It was the first of M√©li√®s's films to surpass 200 meters in length, and the second (after his Cinderella the previous year) to use changes of scene, with twelve sets employed and that number of scenes, or tableaux, advertised. (Cinderella was advertised as having twenty tableaux, but they were filmed on only six sets; this division of long scenes into smaller segments for advertising purposes would become M√©li√®s's standard practice. Joan of Arc, by contrast, was advertised with twelve scenes, one per set.) The artist Charles Claudel, who also repainted the interior of the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin in 1901 following M√©li√®s's designs, was the set painter for the film. The cameraman was Leclerc, who also worked for M√©li√®s as the pianist at the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin. M√©li√®s's scenario for the film strongly emphasizes Joan's status as a national hero of France and a martyr for the French people; the first scene, in which Joan enters leading a flock of sheep, foreshadows her eventual leading of the French army. The final scene, with its triumphal entry of Joan into heaven and her meeting God, suggests Joan's suitability for Catholic sainthood. (Joan of Arc was beatified by the Church in 1909 and canonized in 1920.) Most of the film is staged in M√©li√®s's usual theatrical style, with a stationary camera viewing the action from afar, in a long shot, as if viewing a stage spectacle from a seat in the audience. However, the eighth scene, the Siege of Compi√®gne, is notable for a more modern-looking visual effect: in that scene, actors move much closer to the camera, in the distance of a medium shot. This is the second example, among M√©li√®s's extant films, of experiments with medium shots; the first had occurred the previous year in Bagarre entre journalistes, an installment of M√©li√®s's series The Dreyfus Affair. An advertisement for the film claims that \\"almost 500 people\\" can be seen in the grand parade at Orl√©ans, an effect created by having a moderately sized group of people cross the screen from left to right, go around the north side of the studio, and re-enter, repeating the cycle several times to simulate a much larger crowd. Release and survival Joan of Arc was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 264‚Äì275 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a pi√®ce cin√©matographique √† grand spectacle en 12 tableaux. As the film scholar Jacques Malth√™te has noted, M√©li√®s's descriptions of the film in advertising material never mention that Joan's enemies are English; this omission occurs not only in the English-language materials (where mentioning conflict with the French may have been thought harmful to sales), but also in the French ones (where the omission is less understandable). The film was M√©li√®s's second big cinematic success (Cinderella was the first). It was shown widely in France, and was also exhibited elsewhere, including in Montreal and Havana. In England, the film was distributed by the Warwick Trading Company, which handled English releases of M√©li√®s's films until 1902. In the United States, the Edison Manufacturing Company sold \\"dupes\\" (illegally duplicated prints) of the film. American film piracy became such a problem for M√©li√®s, especially after the success of his much-pirated 1902 film A Trip to the Moon, that he opened an American branch of his company in New York in 1903, under the direction by his brother Gaston M√©li√®s, for added copyright protection. The film was believed lost until 1982, when a hand-colored print with the first scene missing was discovered by the collector Ren√© Charles.

The purpose of the organization is to defend the rights of journalists and contribute to the development of press freedom throughout the world. CJFE recognizes that these rights are not confined to journalists and strongly supports and defends the broader objective of freedom of expression in Canada and around the world. History CJFE was established in 1981, and parented initially by the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) (now the Canadian Association of Journalists) as the CIJ Latin American Committee. In 1984 the group's name was changed to the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists. Then in 1998 it became Canadian Journalists for Free Expression. Many of the Centre's members were shocked at the life-threatening conditions for journalists working in Latin America during the early 1980s. From 1979 to 1981, some 150 journalists had been killed or disappeared while in the custody of security forces in the region. Moved to action by this violence against their southern counterparts, the CIJ agreed to form a special committee to campaign against the kidnapping, torture and murder of media workers throughout Latin America. It was thus that the CIJ Latin American Committee came into being. Working groups were formed in several cities, including Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Ottawa. Each centre maintained files on violations of freedom of expression for different countries in the region, and a \\"Red Alert\\" network was set up to react to reports of attacks. A few years later, the group changed its name to the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists and, with it, began to work in other parts of the world. There was another name change - this time to reflect the larger free expression mandate of the organization - as well as a significant expansion of activities of CJFE both in Canada and internationally. One of the principal activities of CJFE is the management of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of more than 80 non-governmental organisations that monitors free expression violations around the world and defends journalists, writers and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression. Awards The CJFE International Press Freedom Awards, which were launched in 1998, have become the signature event of the organization's press freedom awareness activities in Canada. The gala dinner brings together some of the biggest names in Canadian media to honour colleagues from Canada and around the world who have been persecuted because of their work. Two awards are given each year to foreign journalists who overcome great odds to report the news. Past award winners include Tunisian journalist and human rights activist Sihem Bensedrine, Canadian photographer Zahra Kazemi, Kazakhstani journalist Lira Baysetova and Iranian journalist Akbar Ganji. CJFE presents three other awards: the Tara Singh Hayer Press Freedom Award, the Vox Libera Award, and the Integrity Award. The Tara Singh Hayer Press Freedom Award honours a Canadian journalist who, through his or her work, has made an important contribution to reinforcing and promoting the principle of freedom of the press in this country or elsewhere. The award is named after the Canadian journalist and editor of the Vancouver-based Indo- Canadian Times who was assassinated in November 1998. The Vox Libera Award is given to a non-journalist who has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to the principles of free expression and who has had made an important and sustained contribution - at home or abroad - to those same principles. The Integrity Award was developed to recognize and build awareness of the need to protect the rights of \\"whistleblowers.\\" The recipients of this award are individuals who have acted courageously in the public interest without thought of personal gain, and in doing so risked reprisals in the form of threats to their careers, livelihood, or personal freedom. Journalists in Distress Fund CJFE operates the Journalists in Distress Fund for the benefit of working journalists in defence of democracy, human rights, justice and freedom of expression. The fund exists primarily to encourage freedom of expression and the practice of journalism, and to provide humanitarian assistance to journalists whose lives and well-being are threatened. The Fund provides financial assistance to journalists and their families whose lives are at risk or whose freedom of expression has been seriously infringed. Examples of fundable expenses are medical costs arising from imprisonment or physical mistreatment, legal costs arising from action taken in the courts against journalists because of their reporting as well as emergency travel costs so that journalists and their families can escape persecution. Among other cases, the Journalists in Distress Fund has provided emergency assistance to a trio of persecuted Ethiopian journalists who fled to Kenya; a Thai journalist who, after recovering from a shooting, required money to continue publication of his newspaper; and the wife and child of a disappeared Belarusian journalist, who was said to have been abducted on orders of the government.

It is based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. I Marine Expeditionary Force is the largest of the three MEFs in the Fleet Marine Force and is often referred to as the \\"Warfighting MEF\\" for its consistent involvement and contributions in major armed conflicts. It is presently commanded by Lt. Gen. Karsten S. Heckl. The deputy commander is Brig. Gen. Thomas Savage, who concurrently serves as the commanding general of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade. Etymology Pronunciation of the Roman numeral designator: As a Roman numeral the capital letter \\"I\\", representing one (1), is properly pronounced as \\"One\\". However, there are some who erroneously pronounce the number as either \\"First\\", or either intentionally, or unknowingly, pronounce it as \\"Eye\\", as in the letter \\"I\\". The convention of using Roman numerals to designate a MEF, which is itself the Marine Corps equivalent organization to an Army corps, stems from the U.S. Army practice that began in the American Civil War, and continues today, of numbering corps (two or more divisions with supporting troops, and sometimes including separate brigades, regiments, groups, or battalions, all under a unified corps headquarters, usually commanded by a lieutenant general) with Roman numerals. Corps, themselves being the first-level sub-unit of a \\"field army\\", or a numbered, or named, army (e.g., First U.S. Army, or the Army of the Potomac). During the First World War, the 4th Marine Brigade, as part of the U.S. Army 2nd Infantry Division, came under the U.S. Army I Corps, American Expeditionary Forces. With the expansion of the Marine Corps to six divisions and five air wings during the Second World War, the Marine Corps created two \\"Amphibious Corps\\", I Marine Amphibious Corps (later re-designated as III Amphibious Corps) and V Amphibious Corps, continuing the custom begun by the Army. Modern Marine Expeditionary Forces, or MEFs (for a time known as Marine Amphibious [italics added] Forces, or MABs) continue the U.S. Marine Corps legacy as corps- equivalent organizations designated by Roman numerals. Mission When directed, I MEF deploys and is employed as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) in support of Combatant Commander (COCOM) requirements for contingency response or Major Theater War; with appropriate augmentation, serves as the core element of a Joint Task Force (JTF); prepares and deploys combat-ready MAGTF's to support COCOM presence and crisis response; and supports service and COCOM initiatives as required.

The original game was one of the first in its genre, being released in March 1983 by the Japanese video game developer Koei. Nobunaga's Ambition takes place during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. The player is tasked with achieving the ultimate goal of warlord Oda Nobunaga: the conquest and unification of Japan. Selecting Oda Nobunaga is optional, however, as the player is also able to choose from a variety of other regional daimy≈çs of the time. Games in the franchise have been released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, 3DO, Super Nintendo, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. The title was also released for Macintosh as well as MSX, Amiga, and MS-DOS. As of March 2018, the series has shipped more than 10 million copies worldwide.https://gematsu.com/2018/03/nobunagas-ambition-series- tops-10-million-shipments Gameplay The player may choose from four campaign scenarios, including \\"Battle for the East\\" (beginning in 1560), \\"Daimyo Power Struggles\\" (1560), \\"Ambition Untamed\\" (1571), and \\"Road Towards Unification\\" (1582). In each scenario, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, provide a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty. Gameplay is taken in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season, and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. The player may achieve victory through numerous means, among which are forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies. The player can make many choices during the campaign. According to Evan Brooks of Computer Gaming World: \\"One may transfer soldiers between fiefs, go to war, increase taxes (which causes a decrease in peasant loyalty which may lead to rebellion), transfer rice or gold to another fief, raise the level of flood control (which decreases productivity), make a non-aggression pact or arrange a marriage, cultivate (which increases productivity, but decreases peasant loyalty), use a merchant (to buy/sell rice, borrow funds, or purchase weapons), recruit for the military (soldiers or ninja), train the army (which increases fighting efficiency), spy on a rival, expand a town (which increases taxes collected, but decreases peasant loyalty), give food/rice to peasants/soldiers (to raise morale), steal peasants from rival daimyos, allocate military strength, recuperate (even a daimyo can get sick), turn over a controlled fief to the computer for administration, or pass a turn.\\" Games * is the first title in the series, released March 1983.

Reception  The Nobunaga's Ambition series has garnered several awards over the years. According to Koei's website, various releases in the series have won Log-In magazine's \\"BHS Prize\\", the \\"Minister of Post & Telecommunications Prize\\", Nikkei BP's 12th, 13th, and 14th annual \\"Best PC Software\\" awards, and CD-ROM Fan's \\"Fan of the Year 2001 Grand Prize\\". In North America, where it was released five years after its Japanese release, critical reception was also positive. The game was positively reviewed by Computer Gaming World, where reviewer Evan Brooks gave it four stars out of five. He introduced the game as \\"a detailed economic / diplomatic / political / military simulation of the unification of Japan in the Sixteenth Century.\\" He praised the graphics for being \\"among the best that this reviewer has ever seen for the IBM\\" and the 5x10 hex map battles, and noted that it used role-playing game elements, including assigning various statistics to a selected persona, a time system where each turn represents a year, as the daimyo ages and eventually dies of old age, and a multiplayer option. He stated that he \\"thoroughly enjoyed Nobunaga's Ambition\\", concluded with a \\"Highly Recommended\\" rating, Compute! similarly praised the IBM PC version, calling it \\"one of the best strategic war games ever designed for a personal computer\\" and citing the game play, user interface, and documentation. The console versions had a more lukewarm reception. Reviewing the SNES version, GamePro praised the control interface and combat system but opined that the game essentially offers nothing to set it apart from Koei's previous historical simulators. The magazine rated the Genesis version similarly, saying that \\"Like all Koei games, Nobunaga has an easy-to-use but detailed menu-driven interface that activates a load of complex commands.\\" In 1996, Next Generation listed the series collectively as number 34 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"Lead designer Shou Kibasawa is a tactical genius who realizes that domestic and military strategies are interconnected, and that fielding armies can only be accomplished after building an infrastructure to support them. As a result, Nobunaga's Ambition boasts a level of strategic complexity few other series can come close to matching.\\" See also *Bandit Kings of Ancient China *Kessen III ReferencesExternal links Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence official website *Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence ‚Äì Ascension official website Category:Works about Oda Nobunaga Category:Role- playing video games Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1983 Category:Amiga games Category:DOS games Category:Game Boy games Category:Grand strategy video games Category:Mac OS games Category:Koei games Category:Koei Tecmo franchises Category:MSX games Category:MSX2 games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games about samurai Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sengoku video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games set in the 16th century Category:Video games set in feudal Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Video game franchises Category:Cultural depictions of Oda Nobunaga ","title":"Nobunaga's Ambition"},{"id":"1865778","text":"Peter Friederich (born 1942 in St Gallen) is a former Swiss ambassador to Luxembourg.

In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August 6\\\\. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August 10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland. Threatening much of the East Coast of the United States, hurricane warnings were issued from Georgia to Maine. An estimated 500,000 people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. Overall, impacts from Belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across New England. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power due to high winds. A total of 12 people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100 million. Portions of New Jersey, New York, and Vermont were later declared major disaster areas by then-President Gerald Ford. Some damage also took place in New Brunswick, Canada, from heavy rain. Meteorological history On July 28, 1976, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. An unusually well-organized system for the time of year and location, considerable deep convection accompanied it. A possible low-level circulation consolidated within the system by July 31 as it raced west across the Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the Lesser Antilles in early August, convection separated from the system and moved north of the islands while the wave itself continued into the Caribbean Sea. The northern portion of the system eventually reached a point north of the Bahamas on August 5 and grew increasingly organized. Well-defined upper-level outflow became established that evening. A low-level center formed early on August 6 and became a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC while situated roughly 290 mi (465 km) east-northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. Over the next 24 hours, the system remained almost stationary and executed a small counter-clockwise loop. Early on August 7, the depression acquired gale-force winds and became a tropical storm. Accordingly, it was assigned the name Belle. Acquiring a slow northwest trajectory, Belle steadily intensified on August 7\\\\. Reconnaissance aircraft investigating the storm revealed the system to have achieved hurricane strength by 18:00 UTC as its pressure fell to 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Additionally, a well-defined eye was present by this time. Hurricane Belle off the coast of Delaware and Maryland, approaching landfall in New York, on August 9 The cyclone turned northward and accelerated on August 8 while reaching major hurricane status that evening. Early on August 9, Belle achieved its peak intensity with maximum estimated surface winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 957 mb (hPa; 28.26 inHg). At higher altitudes within the storm, recon reported winds up to 150 mph (240 km/h). Turning to just east of due north, Belle began weakening shortly thereafter with its eye becoming obscured. Late on August 9, the hurricane passed within 60 mi (95 km) of Hatteras Island, North Carolina. Contrary to most storms which threaten the northeastern states, Belle did not accelerate tremendously as it neared land. Accordingly, it weakened quickly in response to cooler waters in the region. Around 05:00 UTC on August 10, Belle made landfall as a minimal hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds along Jones Beach, Long Island, New York. Briefly crossing the Long Island Sound, Belle made a second landfall as a strong tropical storm near Bridgeport, Connecticut. Once inland over New England, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while traversing New Hampshire. The remnants accelerated northeast and later due east across Atlantic Canada before emerging over the Labrador Sea on August 12\\\\. While situated between the Azores and Greenland, ex-Belle turned north- northeast and ultimately dissipated south of Iceland on August 15. Preparations Radar image of Hurricane Belle off the coast of North Carolina on August 9 Owing to Hurricane Belle's proximity to many states along the Eastern Seaboard, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for the entire coast from Georgia to Maine. Accordingly, evacuations took place in numerous states with an estimated 500,000 people evacuating overall. Officials advised residents near the coastline to evacuate to safer areas further inland. Approximately 40,000 vacationing in the Outer Banks evacuated; however, roughly 2,500 residents decided to ride out the storm in their homes. In Kitty Hawk and Nags Head, volunteer firefighters traveled door-to-door urging residents to leave. Schools and hotels across the areas were utilized as shelters for tourists. National Parks across the Outer Banks closed for the duration of the storm. Aircraft at the Marine Corps Camp Lejeune were relocated inland and helicopters were moved to hangars; some helicopters remained available for emergency rescue operations. An estimated 6,200 residents evacuated to Red Cross shelters in the state. The majority of evacuations in the country were in New Jersey, with 250,000 residents and tourists relocating. Of this total, 65,000 were from Long Beach Island and 12,000 on the Barnegat Peninsula. With Hurricane Belle expected to make landfall around high tide and a full moon, the forecast storm tide in rivaled that of Hurricane Donna in 1960. This placed roughly 500,000 people in danger and officials in New York immediately began preparations. Police officers handed out sandbags to residents in low-lying areas and National Guard armories and some public schools were used as evacuation centers. Approximately 30,000 evacuated in New York City and Suffolk County, 11,000 of whom utilized the aforementioned shelters. In Staten Island, 225 patients in a local hospital were relocated to a second facility. A flood watch was issued for the Hudson Valley in southern New York ahead of the hurricane on August 8. Advisories from the National Hurricane Center emphasized the flood risk as well. Numerous flights in and out of New York were cancelled, Wall Street was closed, and the United Nations postponed a meeting. Summer tourists evacuated from most beaches but many residents decided to stay. In Connecticut, 52 helicopters and 100 pilots from the National Guard were placed on standby for possible relief missions following the storm. Farther north in Rhode Island, 10,000 people fled from the coast. Despite evacuation orders, nearly half of the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result martial law was implemented to get people to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70 flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state. Impact Rainfall accumulations from Hurricane Belle across the Eastern United States Across the Eastern United States, the effects of Belle were less than anticipated. A total of 12 people lost their lives, mostly due to traffic accidents, and damage amounted to $100 million. Hurricane Belle produced a swath of light to moderate, and locally heavy, rain extending from North Carolina into New England. The highest totals were confined to areas closer to the storm's center, with accumulations of common along its track. Notable state maximums included in Massachusetts, in Maryland, in Maine, in New York, in New Jersey, in Connecticut, and in Virginia. Although on the weaker side of the storm, New Jersey saw the highest winds from Belle, with an estimated peak gust of 90 mph (150 km/h) in Ship Bottom. A similar gust was estimated to have occurred in Jones Beach, New York, where Belle made landfall. Hurricane-force gusts also affected portions of Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina. LaGuardia Airport, near New York City, saw sustained winds of with gusts to , while Bridgeport, Connecticut has gusts to 77 mph. Tides of above normal were common from North Carolina to Rhode Island. Atlantic City, New Jersey saw the greatest tides at above mean low-tide, while Battery Park in lower Manhattan saw a peak value of above mean low tide. North Carolina escaped relatively unscathed from the hurricane, with only a few reports of wind damage in the Outer Banks. Windows at a hotel in Nags Head were blown out. Along the North Carolina‚ÄìVirginia border, five people lost their lives in a car accident on a rain-slicked highway. Minor damage took place in Maryland. Although on the weaker side of the storm, gusty winds knocked down numerous power lines in New Jersey, leaving 10,000 people in the dark and setting off 75 fire alarms, one of which was a relatively large fire forcing the evacuation of a nursing home. Roughly of the Atlantic City boardwalk was damaged or destroyed, with repairs estimated to reach $5 million. Damage to properties in Monmouth and Ocean counties amounted to $3.6 million and $1 million, respectively. On August 21, then-President Gerald Ford issued a major disaster declaration for Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth, and Ocean counties, allowing them to receive federal funding. The high winds knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000 residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania were called in to assist in restoring electricity. Damage across the island reached $8 million, of which $3 million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. An estimated 36,000 residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000 people lost electricity. Commuter train service along Conrail's New York‚ÄìNew Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1 million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm. A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August 14. Owing to heavy rains that preceded the hurricane, widespread small stream flooding took place in New England, particularly in Vermont where then-governor Thomas P. Salmon declared a state of emergency. Flooding in the state was reported as the worst in 30 years, with southern areas of the state seeing the greatest damage. Hardest hit was the town of Chester where 35 of its 85 roads flooded and 5 bridges were washed out. Otter Creek crested at above flood stage. Significant damage also took place in Jamaica, Ludlow, and Londonderry. Two people died in Huntington after the footbridge they were crossing collapsed into the Huntington River. Portions of Route 100 were washed out. Property damage in the state reached $5‚Äì10 million. The overall scale of flooding was regarded as a 1-in-10 to 1-in-25 year event. Immediately following the hurricane, a statewide ban on drinking water was imposed with an order to boil it first. This was later lifted on August 23. Salt accumulation along power lines in Rhode Island cut electricity to 8,000 residents on Aquidneck Island. Along the Saint John River in Aroostook County, Maine, flooding caused $2.5 million worth of damage to crops and buildings. Heavy rains across New Brunswick, Canada, amounting to in Edundston, triggered flooding that damaged crops, homes, and roads. Losses from the event were estimated to be at least $1 million.

It is dedicated to Theodor Av√©-Lallemant. Place of the 5th Symphony among Tchaikovsky's later symphonies In the first ten years after graduating from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1865 Tchaikovsky completed three symphonies. After that he started five more symphony projects, four of which led to a completed symphony premiered during the composer's lifetime. The fifth symphony was composed in 1888, between the Manfred Symphony of 1885 and the sketches for a Symphony in E, which were abandoned in 1892 (apart from recuperating material from its first movement for an Allegro Brillante for piano and orchestra a year later). As for the numbered symphonies, Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 was composed between Symphony No. 4, which had been completed ten years earlier, and Symphony No. 6, composed 5 years later, in the year of the composer's death. Program Unlike its two predecessors, Symphony No. 5 has no clear program. On 15 April 1888, about a month before he began composing the symphony, the composer sketched a scenario for its first movement in his notebook, containing \\"... a complete resignation before fate, which is the same as the inscrutable predestination of fate ...\\" It is however uncertain how much of this program has been realised in the composition.Steinberg at SFS website. Cyclical structure Like the Symphony No. 4, No. 5 is a cyclical symphony, with a recurring main theme. Unlike No. 4, however, the theme is heard in all four movements, a feature Tchaikovsky had first used in the Manfred Symphony, which was completed less than three years before No. 5. Instrumentation The work is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in A, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings. Description of the work The Symphony is in four movements: The symphony displays an overall tonal trajectory of E minor to E major. The first movement ends in the minor mode, which allows the narrative to continue through the rest of the symphony: :E minor (1st mvt) ‚Üí B minor ‚Üí E minor ‚Üí D major (2nd mvt) ‚Üí F# major ‚Üí D major ‚Üí F# minor ‚Üí V7 (V) of D major ‚Üí D major ‚Üí G7 ‚Üí D major ‚Üí A major (3rd mvt) ‚Üí F# minor ‚Üí A major ‚Üí E major (4th mvt) ‚Üí E minor ‚Üí D major ‚Üí C major ‚Üí E minor ‚Üí F# major ‚Üí E minor ‚Üí E major The recurring main theme is used as a device to unify the four movements of the symphony. This motto theme, sometimes dubbed \\"Fate theme\\", has a funereal character in the first movement, but gradually transforms into a triumphant march, which dominates the final movement. A typical performance of the symphony lasts somewhat less than 50 minutes. First movement ;Themes and Motives Motto Theme, mm. 1‚Äì4: : \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 4/4 \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Andante\\" 4 = 80 g4. g16 g a4.( g16-.) fis-. g4( e2.) b'4. b16 b c4.( b16-.) a-. b4( g2) e'4-- d-- c-- b-- a-- g2. e'4-- d-- c-- b-- a-- g2~ g8 } Primary Theme 1 (PT1), mm. 42‚Äì50: : \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 6/8 \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Allegro con anima\\" 4. = 104 \\\\partial 8*1 c8( e)[ r16 e e8~] e fis-.( g-.) a( g) fis( e4) c8( g')[ r16 g16 g8~] g[ r16 fis fis8~] fis[ r16 e e8~] e4 } Primary Theme 2 (PT2), mm. 116‚Äì128: : \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 6/8 \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo 4. = 104 fis4.~ fis4 gis8( ais4.) b4( cis8) d4. cis fis, } Subordinate Theme (ST), mm. 170‚Äì182: : \\\\relative c { \\\\time 6/8 \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Molto piu tranquillo\\" 4. = 92 r8 fis4 e( d8) r g4 fis4( e8) r a4 cis b8~ b a4 gis( g8) } Motive X, mm.154‚Äì170: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff = \\"RH\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 \\\\tempo \\"Un pochettino piu animato\\" 4. = 104 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8} ew Staff = \\"LH\\" \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 } >> } In the exposition of the first movement, the initial tonality (E minor) is relatively unstable. A D major tonality slips in and out E minor as V of the relative major (G major), but not until mm. 128‚Äì132 does one hear this as an antagonistic to E minor. The exposition concludes in D major after integrating part of the PT1 into its cadential moment (mm. 194‚Äì198). Motive X frames the secondary theme group by preceding the ST and reiterating D major afterwards. The development consists of four distinct sections. The first section exhibits a sequence based on the PT1 superimposed with motive X. This is accompanied by a bass line that diatonically descends over an octave and a fifth. The second section develops the head motive from PT1. The shifting meter (from to ), and diminished sonority (m. 261 for example) adds to growing instability. The third section is a brief allusion to the PT2, interrupted by a fugato based on PT1. Motive X returns strongly and insistently in m. 285, going back and forth between G minor and D minor. This can be interpreted as an effort to re- establish sonority in D. The re-transition to recapitulation is rather abrupt, yet a clever use of common tone modulation can be observed. The recapitulation of this movement follows the convention of sonata form. Second movement ;Themes The second movement begins with the continuation of the tragic sonority in B minor, as if the movement will be in the minor dominant of the tonic of the symphony. Instead, a common chord modulation leads to a D major theme first introduced by a solo horn. : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 12/8 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Andante cantabile\\" 4. = 54 < d b fis b, >2. < fis d b > < g d b g>  < a fis d a d,> < b g e d g, g,>  < a g e cis a a,>  < a e a, cis> } Theme A1 (1st horn): : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 12/8 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Andante cantabile\\" 4. = 54 \\\\partial 8*3 d8( cis) b--  d4.( cis2.) a8\\\\<( b) cis--!  e4.( d2.)\\\\> d8(! e) fis--  g4.\\\\< g4 g8 g4.~ g4 g8!  g4.(\\\\> fis)! } Theme A2 (oboe/horn): : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 12/8 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Con moto\\" 4. = 60 << { \\\\stemUp fis'4.^\\"oboe\\" ais,4( dis8) cis2.  fis4. ais,4( dis8) cis2.  \\\\times 3/2 { cis8--[ dis--] } \\\\times 3/2 { eis--[ fis--] } \\\\times 3/2 { ais--([ gis--)] } \\\\times 3/2 { fisis--[ gis--] }  b4.( ais) s2.  s } \\\\ { \\\\stemDown s2. gis,4._\\"horn\\" dis4( eis8)  fis4.~ fis8 s s gis4. dis4( eis8)  fis4.~ fis8 s s s2.  \\\\times 3/2 { cis8--[ dis--] } \\\\times 3/2 { eis--[ fis--] } \\\\times 3/2 { ais--([ gis--)] } \\\\times 3/2 { g--[ gis--] }  b4.( ais) } >> } Theme B (clarinet in A): : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key b \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Moderato con anima\\" 4 = 100 cis4. gis'8( b a) gis-- fis--  e4-> \\\\times 8/9 {d32( e d e d e d e d } cis2)  b4->~( b16 cis d fis) cis2  b4->~( b16 cis d gis) cis,2 } This movement is in a standard ternary form with the A section in D major, the B section alluding to F minor, then a restatement of the A section with different orchestration. Compared to the stable A section, the B section exhibits instability in many ways. For example, the theme begins and remains in V7 of F minor, even though it could be easily resolved to F minor. Moreover, the segmentation of a theme, fugato texture, and rapid shift of hyper meter contributes to the instability of this section. In this movement, the motto theme appears twice: from mm. 99‚Äì103 as a structural dominant preparing the return of the A section, and in the coda (mm. 158‚Äì166) in G7. One could interpret this as a preparation for I6, but also as a structural leading tone to the next movement (G7 ‚Üí A), especially since the unwinding from the climactic restatement of the motto theme occurs relatively hesitantly and what follows seems to diminish away.

These elements take over the movement in the trio section, which is a scherzo. The scherzo theme initially played by the first violins can be seen as a superimposition of over . Hemiola is used again as a transitional technique (mm. 97‚Äì105). The waltz returns, but with the texture from the scherzo. The return of the motto theme in the third movement, preceded by a waltz in a major mode, recalls the opening of the symphony, but with a hemiola element: : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 3/4 \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\tempo 4 = 138 e2\\\\pp^\\"Clarinet/Bassoon\\" e8 e  f2 e8 d  e r cis2->~  cis2.  e2 e8 e  f2 e8 dis  e r cis2->~  cis4 a'2->\\\\mf  gis2->\\\\dim fis4->~  fis f2->  e2.->~  e4\\\\pp a2->\\\\mf  gis2->\\\\dim fis4->~  fis f2->  e2.-> } Fourth movement ;Themes Introduction ‚Äì Motto Theme: : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Andante maestoso\\" 4 = 80 gis4.^\\"Violin/Cello\\"\\\\mf gis16 gis a4. gis16 fisis  gis8 r e2->~ e8 r  b'4. b16 b cis4. b16 a  b8 r gis4->~ gis8 r e'4--\\\\f  dis-- cis-- b--\\\\> b8.(! ais16)  gis2. e'4--\\\\f  dis-- cis-- b-- dis8.( cis16)  b2.~\\\\> b8! r } PT1 (violin I): : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Allegro vivace (alla breve)\\" 2 = 120 r4^\\"Violin\\"\\\\f \\\\downbow \\\\downbow \\\\downbow  **\\\\downbow8  r 4\\\\downbow \\\\downbow \\\\downbow  **\\\\downbow8  r 4\\\\downbow \\\\downbow \\\\downbow  \\\\downbow 8 dis dis  r 4\\\\downbow \\\\downbow \\\\downbow  \\\\downbow 8 dis dis  r} PT2: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo 2 = 120 r4^\\"Oboe\\" r8 b\\\\mf\\\\<( e4.) fis8(!  g4.)\\\\f\\\\> fis8!\\\\mf( e4.) fis8(  cis4.->) d8( b4.->) cis8(  a4.->) b8( g4.->) a8(  fis->) } ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor r4^\\"Clarinet/Bassoon\\" e--\\\\mf d-- e(  cis\\\\< d) b( cis  a!) r4 r2  R1 } >> } : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo 2 = 120 r4 cis(\\\\p^\\"Violin\\" b cis)  fis,2(\\\\< gis)  a4( ais cis b)!  fis'4.(\\\\sf\\\\> e8)! ais,4.(\\\\mf b8)  r4 cis(\\\\p b cis) } ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor R1  r4 cis4(\\\\p^\\"Viola/Cello\\" b cis)  fis,2(\\\\< gis)  a4( ais cis b)!  fis'4.(\\\\sf\\\\> e8 gis,4)! r4 } >> } ST: : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo 2 = 120 e1~^\\"Flute/Oboe/Clarinet\\"\\\\mf_\\"espr.\\"  e2 d8( cis b a)  e'2->( d~  d) d\\\\<  g g!  g->(\\\\f fis)  fis2.->(\\\\mf e4)  d( cis b a) } The exposition of the last movement begins in E minor, whilst the D major sonority seeks to establish itself. Unlike the first movement, there is an early statement in D major, as well as in V7 of D major (mm. 86‚Äì90, 106‚Äì114). A passage of key oppositions, increasing harmonic rhythm, segmentation, and rapid changes of themes culminates at m. 172 with the re-introduction of the motto theme in C major. : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo 2 = 120 2.^\\"Brass\\"\\\\ff 8  2\\\\. 8  8 r r4 c8 r r4  R1  2\\\\. 8  2\\\\. g8 f  g8 r r4 8 r r4  r2  ** e4~ e8 r r2  r2  ** e4~ e8 r r2 } ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key e \\\\minor 2.\\\\ff 8  2\\\\. 8  8 r r4 8 r r4  R1  2\\\\. 8  2\\\\. 8  8 r r4 8 r r4  r2 **  **  **4~ **8 r r2  r2 **  **  **4~ **8 r r2 } >> } The development is very brief, lasting about 60 measures. In the recapitulation, a new melody is superimposed over the texture, but never returns. The sixth statement of the motto theme is in E minor, leading to an emphatic Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC) in B major. Following this, the coda succeeds in reemphasizing the tonic, using different themes and many cadences in the tonic. Some of the themes used here are the motto theme (m. 474), the countermelody to PT1 (m. 474, superimposed onto the motto theme), PT2 (m. 504), and PT1 from the first movement of the symphony. : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 6/4 \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Molto meno mosso\\" 2. = 96 4.\\\\ffff^\\"Florida Manets\\" 8 4 e,4.^\\"Horns\\" e8 e4 e fis gis  a gis fis e dis cis } Critical reaction Some critics, including Tchaikovsky himself, have considered the ending insincere or even crude. After the second performance, Tchaikovsky wrote, \\"I have come to the conclusion that it is a failure\\". Despite this, the symphony has gone on to become one of the composer's most popular works. The second movement, in particular, is considered to be classic Tchaikovsky: well crafted, colorfully orchestrated, and with a memorable melody for solo horn. The melody, however, was not conceived by Tchaikovsky on his own but taken from the third movement of Joachim Raff's Symphony No. 10 \\"Zur Herbstzeit\\", which had been written 7 years earlier. Possibly for its very clear exposition of the idea of \\"ultimate victory through strife\\", the Fifth was very popular during World War II, with many new recordings of the work, and many performances during those years. One of the most notable performances was by the Leningrad Radio Orchestra during the Siege of Leningrad. City leaders had ordered the orchestra to continue its performances to keep the spirits high in the city. On the night of October 20, 1941 they played Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 at the city's Philharmonic Hall and it was broadcast live to London. As the second movement began, bombs started to fall nearby, but the orchestra continued playing until the final note. Since the war it has remained very popular, but has been somewhat eclipsed in popularity by the Fourth and Sixth Symphonies. Critical reaction to the work was mixed, with some enthusiasm in Russia. Berezovsky wrote, \\"The Fifth Symphony is the weakest of Tchaikovsky's symphonies, but nevertheless it is a striking work, taking a prominent place not only among the composer's output but among Russian works in general. ... the entire symphony seems to spring from some dark spiritual experience.\\" On the symphony's first performance in the United States, critical reaction, especially in Boston, was almost unanimously hostile. A reviewer for the Boston Evening Transcript, October 24, 1892, wrote: > Of the Fifth Tchaikovsky Symphony one hardly knows what to say ... In the > Finale we have all the untamed fury of the Cossack, whetting itself for > deeds of atrocity, against all the sterility of the Russian steppes. The > furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons > struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. > Pandemonium, delirium tremens, raving, and above all, noise worse > confounded! The reception in New York was little better. A reviewer for the Musical Courier, March 13, 1889, wrote: > In the Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony ... one vainly sought for coherency and > homogeneousness ... in the last movement, the composer's Calmuck blood got > the better of him, and slaughter, dire and bloody, swept across the storm- > driven score. Uses of the symphony ‚ÄòFarewell, Amanda‚Äô, written by Cole Porter for the 1949 Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn film Adam's Rib, draws liberally from the 4th movement of Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony. It is alleged that a fragment of the \\"fate\\" theme is quoted by Dmitri Shostakovich in his Symphony No. 7 in the \\"invasion\\" theme of the first movement.MacDonald, Ian, The New Shostakovich (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1990). Part of the second movement was given English lyrics under the title Moon Love. The beginning of Annie's Song by John Denver is almost identical to the first horn theme in the second movement, but it seems this was unintentional and only pointed out to Denver by his producer Milt Okun.Alfonso, Barry.

He is known for making the first transcontinental jet flight in U.S. history and for his service as CEO and chairman of Pan American World Airways from 1969 to 1972. Early life and ancestry Halaby was born in Dallas, Texas. His father was Najeeb Elias Halaby (March 17, 1878/1880 ‚Äì December 16, 1928), a Lebanese-Syrian Christian who was born in Zahle, and whose parents hailed from Aleppo, arrived in the United States in 1891. Halaby's paternal grandfather was Elias Halaby, a provincial treasurer or magistrate in Ottoman Syria, who also came to the United States in 1891. Halaby's father worked as an importer, and later as an oil broker; in the mid-1920s he opened Halaby Galleries, a rug boutique and interior-decorating shop, at Neiman Marcus in Dallas, and ran it with his American wife, Halaby's mother, the former Laura Wilkins (April 23, 1889 ‚Äì April 1987). He died shortly afterward, and his estate was unable to continue the new enterprise. Following Halaby's father's death, Laura Halaby married Urban B. Koen, but they ultimately divorced. Halaby's maternal grandfather was John Thomas Wilkins, who served in the 7th Tennessee Cavalry during the American Civil War. Career First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon visits the cockpit of the first commercial Boeing 747 jet, in conjunction with the christening ceremony for the plane at Dulles International Airport Halaby was a graduate of The Leelanau School, a boarding school in Glen Arbor Township, Michigan, and is enshrined in that school's Hall of Fame. An alumnus of Stanford University (1937) and Yale Law School (1940), he served as a U.S. Navy test pilot in World War II. On May 1, 1945, Halaby made history by making the first transcontinental jet flight in U.S. history. Halaby took off from Muroc AFB, California, and landed at Patuxent River NAS, Maryland, 5 hours and 40 minutes later.Orfalea, Gregory The Arab Americans: A History. Olive Branch Press. Northampton, MA, 2006. Page 117 After the war he served as the U.S. State Department's civil aviation advisor to King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, helping the King develop Saudi Arabian Airlines. Next, he worked as an aide to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in the late 1940s, then helped Paul Nitze write NSC 68. He joined Laurance Rockefeller's family office in 1953, reviewing investments in civil aviation. From 1961 to 1965, he served as the second Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) ‚Äì the future Federal Aviation Administration ‚Äì appointed by President John F. Kennedy. Halaby was a proponent for the creation of the United States Department of Transportation, which occurred in April 1967 during his time in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. During his tenure as FAA administrator, he also was the lead proponent of the Boeing 2707 Supersonic Jet. President Johnson signed executive order 11149 approving $1 billion to build a US made SSJ, but eventually the project was cancelled in 1971 because of its cost. From 1969 to 1972, he served as CEO, and chairman after 1970, of Pan American World Airways. As Pan American World Airways chairman, he was present at the christening of the first Boeing 747 aircraft. In an ironic twist of fate, Halaby was meeting with President Richard Nixon on November 24, 1971. Three hours later the same day, D.B. Cooper hijacked Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Washington. In his memoir book, he mentions two hijackings, however, he does not mention the D.B. Cooper hijacking nor does he mention that he was meeting with the President of the United States just hours prior to the hijacking. Personal life Halaby was married three times. He married Doris Carlquist in Washington, D.C., on December 24, 1945 and he divorced her in 1977. They had three children: daughter Lisa, who became Queen of Jordan in 1978; son Christian; and daughter Alexa.The New York Times He was married to the former Jane Allison Coates from 1980 until her death in 1996.

In peer-to-peer file sharing, a software client on an end-user PC requests a file, and portions of the requested file residing on peer machines are sent to the client, and then reassembled into a full copy of the requested file. The \\"tracker\\" server keeps track of where file copies reside on peer machines, which ones are available at time of the client request, and helps coordinate efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file. Clients that have already begun downloading a file communicate with the tracker periodically to negotiate faster file transfer with new peers, and provide network performance statistics; however, after the initial peer-to-peer file download is started, peer-to-peer communication can continue without the connection to a tracker. Since the creation of the distributed hash table (DHT) method for \\"trackerless\\" torrents, BitTorrent trackers have largely become redundant; however, they are still often included with torrents to improve the speed of peer discovery.  Public vs private trackers = Public trackers  Public or open trackers can be used by anyone by adding the tracker address to an existing torrent, or they can be used by any newly created torrent, like OpenBitTorrent. The Pirate Bay operated one of the most popular public trackers until disabling it in 2009 due to legal trouble, and thereafter offered only magnet links.  Private trackers  A private tracker is a BitTorrent tracker that restricts use by requiring users to register with the site. The method for controlling registration used among many private trackers is an invitation system, in which active and contributing members are given the ability to grant a new user permission to register at the site, or a new user goes through an interview process.  Legal issues  Legal uses  There are several circumstances under which it is legal to distribute copyrighted material or parts thereof. * Free distribution. Copyright holders may choose to allow free distribution of their works. Dedicated copyright licenses‚Äîusable by anyone who wants to upload their own material‚Äîare available for that purpose. Such licenses are often used in situations with large numbers of copyright holders, like in online communities. For example, the Creative Commons license family for free cultural works in text, audio, video or image format; or software licenses for Free Software / Open-source software like the BSD License and others. Wikipedia itself can be distributed via BitTorrent for the same reason. * Public domain. Works that are in the public domain and therefore not (or no longer) subject to copyright law can also be legally distributed. For instance, Project Gutenberg regularly collects and publishes classical cultural works after their copyright has expired (which depends on the country in which the work was previously published). * Fair use. Some countries also have fair use provisions in copyright law, which allow people the right to access and use certain classes of copyrighted material without breach of the law. There are also experiments at legally selling content that is distributed over BitTorrent using a \\"secure\\" tracker system.  Improving torrent reliability  Trackers are the primary reason for a damaged BitTorrent \\"swarm\\". (Other reasons are mostly related to damaged or hacked clients uploading corrupt data.) The reliability of trackers has been improved through two main innovations in the BitTorrent protocol.  Multi-tracker torrents  Multi-tracker torrents contain multiple trackers in a single torrent file. This provides redundancy in the case that one tracker fails, the other trackers can continue to maintain the swarm for the torrent. One disadvantage to this is that it becomes possible to have multiple unconnected swarms for a single torrent where some users can connect to one specific tracker while being unable to connect to another. This can create a disjoint set which can impede the efficiency of a torrent to transfer the files it describes. Additional extensions such as Peer exchange and DHT mitigate this effect by rapidly merging otherwise disjoint graphs of peers.  Trackerless torrents  Vuze (formerly Azureus) was the first BitTorrent client to implement such a system through the distributed hash table (DHT) method. An alternative and incompatible DHT system, known as Mainline DHT, was developed simultaneously and later adopted by the BitTorrent (Mainline), ŒºTorrent, Transmission, rTorrent, KTorrent, BitComet, and Deluge clients. Current versions of the official BitTorrent client, ŒºTorrent, BitComet, Transmission and BitSpirit all share compatibility with Mainline DHT. Both DHT implementations are based on Kademlia. As of version 3.0.5.0, Vuze also supports Mainline DHT in addition to its own distributed database through use of an optional application plugin MainlineDHT Plugin. This potentially allows the Vuze client to reach a bigger swarm. Most BitTorrent clients also use Peer exchange (PeX) to gather peers in addition to trackers and DHT. Peer exchange checks with known peers to see if they know of any other peers. With the 3.0.5.0 release of Vuze, all major BitTorrent clients now have compatible peer exchange.  IPv6 support  One of the options for this HTTP based tracker protocol is the \\"compact\\" flag. This flag, as defined in BEP 23, specifies that the tracker can compact the response by encoding IPv4 addresses as a set of 4 bytes (32 bits). IPv6 though are 128 bits long, and as such, the \\"compact\\" would break IPv6 support. To handle that situation clients and trackers must either avoid using compact announces over IPv6 or implement BEP 07  Software  opentracker from Dirk Engling powered one of the biggest BitTorrent trackers, The Pirate Bay tracker.

The current dam was built in the 1980s and is close to the ruins of the Great Dam of Ma'rib built in the 8th century BC.chp 2 Donald Routledge Hill, A history of engineering in classical and medieval times Routledge, 1996 It was one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world and a central part of the Sabaean and Himyarite kingdoms around Ma'rib. There are also other important ancient dams in Yemen such as the Dam of Jufaynah, the Dam of KhƒÅrid, the Dam of A·∏ëra‚Äôah, the Dam of MiqrƒÅn and the Dam of Yath‚ÄôƒÅn. Historically, Yemen has been recognized for the magnificence of its ancient water engineering. From the Red Sea coast to the limits of the Rub' al Khali desert are numerous ruins of small and large dams made of earth and stone. Old dam An artist's depiction of the Great Dam of Ma'rib The site of the great Dam of Ma'rib, also called the Dam of 'Arim (, '), is upstream (south-west) of the ancient city of Ma'rib, once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Saba‚Äô (, possibly Sheba). The Kingdom of Saba' was a prosperous trading nation, with control of the frankincense and spice routes in Arabia and Abyssinia. The Sabaeans built the dam to capture the periodic monsoon rains which fall on the nearby mountains and so irrigate the land around the city. Some tentative archaeological findings suggest that simple earth dams and a canal network were constructed as far back as around 1750 BC,Ocean highways: geographical record, ed. C.R. Markham. January 1874. Ocean highways; geographical review. No. X, Vol. 1 but the most reliable information dates The Great Dam of Ma'rib to about the 8th century BC. It is counted by some as one of the most wonderful feats of engineering in the ancient world. The medieval Arab geographer YƒÅq≈´t al-·∏§amawƒ´ describes it thus: > It is between three mountains, and the flood waters all flow to the one > location, and because of that the water only discharges in one direction; > and the ancients blocked that place with hard rocks and lead. The water from > springs gathers there as well as floodwater, collecting behind the dam like > a sea. Whenever they wanted to they could irrigate their crops from it, by > just letting out however much water they needed from sluice gates; once they > had used enough they would close the gates again as they pleased.YƒÅq≈´t al- > ·∏§amawƒ´: Mu‚Äôjam al-BuldƒÅn. The historical dam was severely damaged by a Saudi airstrike in the night of May 31, 2015.‚ÄúUNESCO Director-General condemns airstrikes on Yemen‚Äôs cultural heritage‚Äù 2015. UNESCO. June 2, 2015. Construction The date of the first construction of a dam at Ma‚Äôrib goes back to somewhere between 1750 and 1700 BC. The earliest inscription on the dam is one placed there at the time of its construction or repair of parts of the dam undertaken by Yatha' Amar Watar I, son of Yada' El Zarih I, who reigned in 760‚Äì740 BC. The following repair was in the time of Yada' El Bayin II who reigned in 740‚Äì720 BC. Renovations were then carried out by Dhamar El Zarih I and Karab El Bayin who reigned in 700‚Äì680 BC. All repairs were minor, consisting of essential maintenance, such as removing dirt, or opening water courses, or stopping up gaps. The Makrib Samah' El Yanuf II, son of Dhamar El Watar II, had his name carved into parts of the dam to mark the completion and repair of the dam. The dam was composed of packed earth, triangular in cross section, 580 m in length and 4 meters high. It ran between two groups of rocks on either side of the river and was linked to the rock with substantial stonework. The dam's position allowed for a spillway and sluices between the northern end of the dam and the cliffs to the west. Around 500 BC the dam height was increased to 7 meters, the upstream slope (the water face) was reinforced with a cover of stones, and irrigation was extended to include the southern side as well as the northern side. After the end of the Kingdom of Saba', the dam fell under the control of the ·∏§imyarites around 115 BC. They undertook further reconstruction, creating a structure 14 meters high with extensive waterworks at both the northern and southern ends, five spillway channels, two masonry-reinforced sluices, a settling pond, and a 1000-meter canal to a distribution tank. These extensive works were not actually finalized until 325 AD and allowed the irrigation of . Maintenance The Muslim historian al-IsfahƒÅnƒ´ (whose Annals were completed in 961 CE) maintainsIn his eighth volume of the Annals. that the famous breach of the dam occurred some four hundred years before the rise of Islam, but YƒÅq≈´t al-·∏§amawƒ´YƒÅq≈´t al-·∏§amawƒ´: Mu'jam al-BuldƒÅn. Vol. 4, p. 383. assigns it to the time of Abyssinian rule. Ancient South Arabian sources report that in about 145 BC, the dam suffered a major breach during the war between the people of RaydƒÅn and the Kingdom of Saba‚Äô, and that is the very breach that many scholars consider to have caused the Sayl al-ÀÅArim (, Flood of the ‚ÄòArim) mentioned in the Quran; it is also mentioned in Arab proverbs which speak about the hands of Saba' having separated at that time. The fighting between the RaydƒÅnites and the Sabaeans delayed the repair of the dam, and this caused devastating losses of crops and fruit, leading large numbers of people to disperse in search of new land capable of supporting life, so huge migrations ensued. It is still uncertain though whether it was that particular breach that caused the \\"flood of ÀÅArim\\" or not, since some migrations certainly took place in the 2nd or 3rd centuries CE, and they are also ascribed to the breaking of the Dam of Ma‚Äôrib. Generally speaking, the dam was repaired twice shortly before the coming of Islam, once by Shar·∏•abƒ´l YaÀÅfar bin Abƒ´ Karab YasÀÅad in 450 , and by Abrahah in 543.The inscription by Abrahah was first published by Eduard Glaser, in the journal Mitteilungen der vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft, Berlin, 1897. pp. 360‚Äì488. The inscriptions on the dam explain the costs of repair and the large number of workers involved. The archaeology of the Ma'rib Dam shows the effects of siltation behind dams in antiquity, and measures to extend the operational life of the reservoir. J√ºrgen D. Garbrecht and Guenther K. H.

The same problems of siltation encountered in the ancient dam was also faced in the construction of the new dam.Moric, Peter. 1997. ‚ÄúQuestioning the Need for Spillways.‚Äù Wilmington Publishing Ltd, Wilmington House, Church Hill, Wilmington, Dartford, Kent, UK. International Water Power & Dam Construction. Volume: 49, no. 1, pp. 24‚Äì26. Abstract: The design of the dam project is discussed focusing on the necessity for spillways and how to determine their overall design. Challenges encountered, factors considered during the design process are discussed and the implications of rare flood conditions are described. . Despite the increases in height, the dam suffered numerous breaches (recorded major incidents occurred in 449, 450, 542 and 548) and the maintenance work became increasingly onerous; the last recorded repairs took place in 557. Final breach Depiction of the dam on the coats of arms of Yemen Local tales report that the final breach of the dam had been predicted by a king called ‚ÄòImrƒÅn, who was also a soothsayer, and later by the wife of the king. According to legend, the breach was caused by large rats gnawing at it with their teeth and scratching it with their nails. In 570 or 575, the dam was again overtopped, and this time left unrepaired. The breaching and destruction of the Dam of Ma‚Äôrib was a historical event, and was alluded to in the Quran: The consequent failure of the irrigation system provoked the migration of up to 50,000 people from Yemen to other areas of the Arabian Peninsula, and even to the Levant. Current dam The current dam in 1986 A new dam was built in the 1980s, close to the location of the old one, at the expense of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the late President of the United Arab Emirates, whose tribe reportedly resettled from Ma'rib to what is now the United Arab Emirates, some time during the 17th century, or in the 6th century, after the collapse of the historical dam. The opening ceremony took place in 1986, in the presence of Sheikh Zayed. The dam was considered by people inside and outside Yemen to have a positive effect on the agriculture and economy of the region of Ma'rib, and the country in general. The new dam is high, long, built of earth across the Wadi Dhana at , creating a storage capacity of 398 million cubic meters. The dam site is located upstream of the ruins of the Great Dam. The new dam, like the old, was designed to store water for irrigating the Ma'rib plains. However, the wadi bed at the new dam site consists of alluvial sand and gravel material 30‚Äì50 m thick. Seepage that emanates from this dam does not threaten its structure, but results in the loss of water. As a way of capturing the seepage, consideration is being given to rebuilding the ancient Ma'rib dam, both as a functioning structure, and also as a historic monument and tourist attraction. The complexity and volume of work involved in this project make it necessary that several organizations work together under the aegis of UNESCO, using financial contributions from international organizations.Ganchikov, VG and Munavvarov, ZI. 1991. ‚ÄúThe Marib Dam (History and the Present Time).‚Äù Hydrotechnical Construction HYCOAR.

Newly constructed dams in Yemen, such as Batis Dam and Ma'rib, are used to collect water for the population. A newspaper wrote in July 2010: \\"The water level in the Ma'rib Dam has risen to 45 million cubic meters as a result of the heavy rainfall in various areas of Yemen in the past two days. Under-Secretary of Ma'rib Governorate, Ali Muhammad al-Fatimid, was briefed Tuesday on the amount of water flowing into the dam and the maintenance of drainage channels and sub systems. The Deputy Director of the Ma'rib Dam Project, Engineer Ahmed al- Arifi, said the water level in the dam on Tuesday rose to 45 million cubic meters, while the water level last April rose to 100 million cubic meters. The gate of the main channel for groundwater was opened in the valley of Ubaida for three months, where the quantity of water flowing amounted to 80 million cubic meters.\\"‚ÄúHigh water levels in Ma'rib and Batis Dams.‚Äù 2010.

Tubifex probably includes several species, but distinguishing between them is difficult because the reproductive organs, commonly used in species identification, are resorbed after mating, and because the external characteristics of the worm vary with changes in salinity. These worms ingest sediments, selectively digest bacteria, and absorb molecules through their body walls. Micro-plastic ingestion by Tubifex worms acts a significant risk for trophic transfer and biomagnification of microplastics up the aquatic food chain. The worms can survive with little oxygen by waving hemoglobin-rich tail ends to exploit all available oxygen, and can exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen through their thin skins, in a manner similar to frogs. They can also survive in areas heavily polluted with organic matter that almost no other species can endure. By forming a protective cyst and lowering its metabolic rate, T. tubifex can survive drought and food shortage. Encystment may also function in the dispersal of the worm. They usually inhabit the bottom sediments of lakes, rivers, and occasionally sewer lines and outlets.

There were numerous random attacks on revelers over a period of about three and a half hours. There were reports of widespread brawling, vandalism, and weapons being brandished. Damage to local businesses exceeded $100,000. About 70 people were reported injured. Several women were sexually assaulted. One man, Kris Kime, died of injuries sustained during an attempt to assist a woman being brutalized. It was Seattle's second serious rioting incident in three years, the first being the 1999 World Trade Organization's Minister Level Conference On World Free Trade. Large crowds and some disturbances occurred during Mardi Gras leading up to the events of Fat Tuesday. The police department's lack of intervention during the disturbance led to allegations of police misconduct. Responses during and after the event by both the Mayor and Chief of Police were met with intense scrutiny. The violence led to a moratorium on large Mardi Gras celebrations in the city and tarnished the neighborhood's reputation. Background Pioneer Square was often described as the center of Seattle's nightlife at the time with its numerous bars and clubs. The neighborhood had been the site of Mardi Gras celebrations since 1977; with more than 90 civilians and 30 officers injured during disorders in 1979. Festivities on the Friday and Saturday leading up to 2001's Fat Tuesday were broken up by police with the city's bicycle patrol at the forefront of squashing festivities. On Saturday, the Seattle Police Department estimated a total between 4,000 and 6,000 people gathered in the area after midnight. The crowd pelted the officers with rocks and bottles after a suspect was arrested for carrying a handgun. Windows were also smashed before the crowd was dispersed through the use of pepper spray, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades. The heavy-handed tactics led to complaints from event goers. Up to 2,000 people gathered in the neighborhood on Sunday evening with fewer incidents. Celebrations were also violent in Austin, Fresno, and Philadelphia that year. Fat Tuesday Over 4,000 party goers initially filled the neighborhood and its bars on Tuesday evening. Police estimated large crowds began forming in the central plaza at 9:00 pm and eventually spilled into the surrounding streets. The celebrations included drinking, dancing, and women baring their breasts for beads. Throngs of men began groping the women as they exposed themselves. Police estimated that the crowd swelled to anywhere between 5,000 and 7,000 people as the evening continued. Sporadic fighting broke out at about 10:40 pm. Police donned riot gear and formed lines but rarely entered the crowd. Some arrests were made at the periphery of the neighborhood's main square. Cars were vandalized and overturned. Small fires were set and the windows of business were shattered. Police were then notified that young men were brandishing handguns and other weapons towards people. By midnight, groups roved through the crowd randomly attacking people along the stretch of Yesler Way between First and Second Avenues. Paramedics were not able to reach some victims due to the lack of police control in the area. The police stood by and did nothing as a group assaulted a female teenager; when a bystander, Kris Kime, attempted to protect her, the group beat him to death. Witnesses said Kime was struck and knocked to the ground as he tried to help the frightened woman who had fallen in the melee. Kime died of massive head injuries. About 70 others were reported injured with 2 suffering gunshot wounds. At 12:30 am, 25 to 30 young men advanced on a line of police. The police retreated while bottles and other debris were thrown. A team of bicycle officers made a quick charge toward the crowd with pepper spray before retreating. Fighting escalated with little police interference until shots were fired from within the mass of people at 1:30 am. With the assistance of an armored vehicle, police advanced on the crowd with tear gas, pepper spray, and flashbangs. The crowds were finally dispersed shortly after 2:00 am. Reactions The day after the riot, local newspapers carried a picture of a black man with brass knuckles engaged in an assault which came to symbolize the riot. An editorial in The Stranger said the incident was racially motivated and that much of the violence was directed at white civilians. Witnesses said gangs of black youth yelled racially charged slurs and sought white victims. Some eyewitnesses said that most of the attackers were black but that race was not a factor in who was victimized. According to the Seattle Weekly, police did not initially see the attacks as solely or even predominately racial violence. Racial issues overshadowed the sexual assaults that took place. One man was charged with forcibly fondling a woman. A photograph of a partially nude woman being groped by some two dozen men while lying topless and on her back won an award from the National Press Photographer Association despite not being previously published in a newspaper. In the wake of the riot, Schell announced a moratorium on Mardi Gras celebrations in Seattle. Schell lost to Greg Nickels and Mark Sidran in the city's 2001 mayoral primary elections. King County Executive Ron Sims called the Mardi Gras riot and the protests at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting \\"defining issues\\" in Schell's failed bid for reelection. Nickels made Kime's death a political issue in his campaign, saying the certificate of death would hang in his office should he become mayor. He kept the pledge upon taking the office. As mayor, Nickels retained Gil Kerlikowske as police chief despite criticism of the police department's inaction during the incident. On the day after the Mardi Gras riot, Seattle experienced the 6.8 Mw Nisqually earthquake, the worst in 37 years. Its scale caused people to refocus their attention on earthquake recovery and away from the violence. Outside the Seattle area, the incidents attracted little media attention and have largely been forgotten. In 2011, local bars reattempted Mardi Gras celebrations in Pioneer Square. Smaller Mardi Gras events had been held but it was the first to consist of a collaboration between multiple establishments. Another group had considered organizing an event but the permitting process was too restrictive. Investigations and legal proceedings Gil Kerlikowske Kerlikowske originally ordered the police at the scene not to intervene, instead maintaining a perimeter around the growing violence. The City of Seattle acknowledged that the police strategy during the incidents presented a public safety threat, and the City made an almost $2,000,000 settlement with Kime's family. Mayor Paul Schell (who was at asleep at home during the events of Tuesday evening) appointed a three-member task force panel to investigate the cause of the riot. He instructed them not to discuss the lack of police intervention which the public had been concerned about. Initially task force meetings were closed to the public, but protest forced the city to open them to attendance. The Seattle Police Officers' Guild later voted no confidence in the chief, citing the Mardi Gras riot as one of the reasons. That night, 21 were arrested. Dozens were later questioned by police after being identified through the use of videotape, photographs, and reports from eyewitnesses. Investigations showed that roughly 75% of the over 100 suspects were black. Many of the suspects had criminal records and were believed to be affiliated with gangs. The man photographed and videotaped wearing brass knuckles and beating people, Aaron Slaughter, was sentenced to three years in prison for assaults on a woman and two men. It ran concurrently with a nine-month sentence he received for rendering criminal assistance during a brawl less than three months later. A 17-year-old, Jerell Thomas, was found guilty in the death of Kime after jurors saw video footage of Thomas hitting Kime in the head three times. He was also convicted of two counts of second-degree assault for attacking two other men with a skateboard. He originally received a 15-year sentence. His conviction was later overturned by a State's Supreme Court decision finding that assailants could not be found guilty of murder if the intent of the assault was not to take a life. In 2006, Thomas avoided a new trial and plead guilty to second-degree manslaughter. He received a 10-year sentence. In December 2009, Thomas was released from prison early. He soon reoffended.

Following a northwest-southeast axis perpendicular to the Saint Lawrence River, the A-73 provides an important freeway link with regions north and south of Quebec City, the capital of the province. It also intersects with Autoroute 20 (south of the river) and Autoroute 40 (north of the river) - one of only three Quebec autoroutes to do so. The A-73 begins less than 40 kilometers from the U.S. border in Quebec's Beauce region, traverses metropolitan Quebec City, and ends in the Laurentian Mountains. Civic, political, and business leaders in regions north and south of the A-73's termini have lobbied the Quebec government to extend the autoroute. While the four-laning of Route 175 to Saguenay has alleviated concerns in the north about safety and connectivity, Quebecers in the Beauce continue to advocate for extending the A-73 to the U.S. border, towards the Armstrong‚ÄìJackman Border Crossing and U.S. Route 201 within Maine. Description=Autoroute Robert-Cliche The southernmost section of the A-73 is named in honour of Robert Cliche. A lawyer, politician, and judge from Quebec's Beauce region, Cliche also served as head of the Quebec branch of the New Democratic Party. The A-73 begins at a roundabout junction with Route 204 in Saint-Georges, tracing the course of the Chaudi√®re River to its junction with Autoroute 20 in Saint-Romuald. Along the way, the A-73 connects the largest cities and towns in Quebec's historic Beauce region. Exit numbers on the A-73 begin at km 43 (which accounts for an as-yet unbuilt section to the Maine border). Initially, much of the A-73 south of the Saint Lawrence River was built as a super-two (one lane in each direction) highway with no median. Work to expand the autoroute to four lanes was completed in 2016. Motorists wishing to continue southward to Maine must currently travel on Route 173, a two-lane highway. Approaching metropolitan Quebec City, the A-73 meets the A-20 (co-signed as a section of the Trans-Canada Highway) at an interchange just south of the Saint Lawrence River. From here, motorists can take the A-20 east to Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Rimouski, and the Gasp√© Peninsula; and west to Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa (via the A-40 and Ontario Highway 417). The A-73 crosses the Saint Lawrence via the Pierre Laporte Bridge‚Äîthe longest suspension bridge in Canada. Autoroute Henri-IV Autoroute Henri-IVNorth of the river, the A-73 is named for Henri IV (Henri-Quatre), King of France at the time of the city of Qu√©bec's founding in 1608. The A-73 provides a partial beltway around metropolitan Quebec to the west and north of the central city. At kilometre 134, the A-73 intersects with the A-540, a spur route connecting the A-73 and A-40 with the approach to Jean-Lesage International Airport. At kilometer 139, the A-73 meets the A-40 and A-440. From here, motorists can take the A-40 west to Trois-Rivi√®res and Montreal, or the A-440 east to Quebec City centre. North of this interchange, A-73 is signed as a concurrency with the A-40 for . Autoroute F√©lix Leclerc Once co-signed with the A-40, the A-73 assumes the name assigned to the A-40. Leclerc was a singer-songwriter, poet, writer, actor and political activist. The A-73/40 continues north for three kilometers to a junction with Autoroute 573, a spur route that provides access to the CFB Valcartier military base. At this intersection, the A-73/40 exit the autoroute, which continues as the A-573. From here, the A-73/40 continues due east, bypassing Quebec City to the north. Whereas the A-73/40 uses A-73 distance-based exit numbers prior to the junction with the A-573, past this point, A-40 distance based exit numbers are used. (This anomaly reflects an unbuilt section of the A-40, which would have started at Saint- Augustin-de-Desmaures, bypassed Jean-Lesage AIrport to the north, and connected with the present-day A-73/40 at the A-573 interchange.) The A-73/40 intersects with the A-740 (a spur route connecting Sainte-Foy with the northern suburbs) at exit 310. At exit 313, A-73 exits the autoroute at a clovermill interchange. North of the junction, the A-73 continues through Quebec City's northern suburbs. South of the junction, the autoroute is signed as Autoroute 973. The A-973 is a spur route which terminates just north of Quebec City centre. The A-40 continues eastward for another ten kilometers to a terminus with the A-440 just east of the city centre. View of A-73 in Stoneham-et-Tewkesbury Autoroute Laurentienne The most northerly section of the A-73 is named for the Laurentian Mountains, a popular destination for outdoor sports north of Quebec City. After the split with the A-40, the A-73 enters the foothills of the Laurentians. The autoroute provides access to the Stoneham Mountain Resort at kilometre 167 and bypasses Stoneham and Tewkesbury to the east. This stretch is cosigned with Route 175. The A-73 ends at kilometre 182, with a final exit at Boulevard Talbot in Stoneham. The road continues as Route 175, which provides a link between Quebec City and the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region to the north. Future=Chaudi√®re- Appalaches Community leaders continue to press for Transports Qu√©bec to extend the A-73 south to the Maine border. The issue resurfaced during a 2015 by-elections in Beauce-Sud, when Coalition Avenir Qu√©bec leader Fran√ßois Legault announced his support for extending the A-73 to Maine as a priority for his party if elected. For its part, Maine continues to debate private financing, construction, and operation of a proposed East-West Highway linking Quebec with the Maritime Provinces. The proposed route, however, would involve connecting with an extended section of Autoroute 10, not the A-73, with the Autoroute 10 crossing some 57 km (35 mi) southwest of it. Maine currently has no plans to convert U.S. Route 201 to Interstate standards, which would provide an all-freeway connection from Quebec City to Interstate 95. Capitale-Nationale Between 2003 and 2013, the governments of Quebec and Canada co-funded reconstruction of Route 175 into a partially-controlled access freeway between the end of A-73 in Stoneham and the junction with the A-70 in Saguenay.Mandats This prompted speculation that the A-73 designation would be extended further northward into the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. As the reconstructed Route 175 is not fully a controlled-access highway, it does not meet Autoroute design standards. Thus, A-73's terminus remains at Stoneham unless and until corresponding sections of Route 175 are upgraded to controlled-access freeway. Quebec Autoroute 70 remains the only autoroute in Quebec that does not directly connect to any other.

Its semantic field corresponds to English ghost, spirit, mind, intellect. Some English translators resort to using \\"spirit/mind\\" or \\"spirit (mind)\\" to help convey the meaning of the term.C. Marvin Pate. From Plato to Jesus: What Does Philosophy Have to Do with Theology?. 2011, page 69. Rosenkranz, Karl. Hegel, as the national philosopher of Germany. 1874, page 85 Geist is also a central concept in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's 1807 The Phenomenology of Spirit (Ph√§nomenologie des Geistes). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel's view of world history of the late 18th century, include Weltgeist \\"world- spirit\\", Volksgeist \\"national spirit\\" and Zeitgeist \\"spirit of the age\\". Etymology and translation German Geist (masculine gender) continues Old High German geist, attested as the translation of Latin spiritus. It is the direct cognate of English ghost, from a West Germanic gaistaz. Its derivation from a PIE root gÃëheis- \\"to be agitated, frightened\\" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening (c.f. English ghastly) apparitions or ghosts, and may also have carried the connotation of \\"ecstatic agitation, furor\\" related to the cult of Germanic Mercury. As the translation of biblical Latin spiritus (Greek œÄŒΩŒµ·ø¶ŒºŒ±) \\"spirit, breath\\" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the Holy Spirit (Old English sƒì hƒÅlga gƒÅst \\"the Holy Ghost\\", OHG ther heilago geist, Modern German der Heilige Geist). The English word is in competition with Latinate spirit from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.As observed by Alexander Gil, The sacred philosophy of the holy scripture: laid down... in... the apostles (1635): \\"The word Ghost in English [...] is as much as athem, or breath; in our new Latin language, a Spirit.\\" Spenser in 1590 could still say No knight so rude, I weene, As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost (Faerie Queene II. viii. 26), by \\"sleeping ghost\\" referring to the sleeping mind of a living person, not the ghost of a deceased one. The German noun much like English spirit could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead, to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the \\"spirit of wine\\", i.e. ethanol. However, its special meaning of \\"mind, intellect\\" never shared by English ghost is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French esprit. In this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy. Geist could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc. It is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of geistlich \\"spiritual, pertaining to religion\\" vs. geistig \\"intellectual, pertaining to the mind\\" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts is made by the adjective geisterhaft \\"ghostly, spectral\\".Geist in Wolfgang Pfeifer, Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch ([1989] 2010). Numerous compounds are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as Geistesgegenwart = pr√©sence d'esprit (\\"mental presence, acuity\\"), Geistesabwesenheit = absence d‚Äôesprit (\\"mental absence, distraction\\"), geisteskrank \\"mentally ill\\", geistreich \\"witty, intellectually brilliant\\", geistlos \\"unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous\\" etc. It is from these developments that certain German compounds containing -geist have been loaned into English, such as Zeitgeist.Zeitgeist \\"spirit of the epoch\\" and Nationalgeist \\"spirit of a nation\\" in L. Meister, Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte (1789). der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist (\\"the frivolous spirit of the world and the time\\") in Lavater, Handbibliothek f√ºr Freunde 5 (1791), p. 57. Zeitgeist is popularized by Herder and Goethe. Zeitgeist in Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. German Geist in this particular sense of \\"mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit\\" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain Geist as a German loanword.  Hegelianism  Geist is a central concept in Hegel's The Phenomenology of Spirit (Ph√§nomenologie des Geistes). According to Hegel, the Weltgeist (\\"world spirit\\") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history. Weltgeist is effected in history through the mediation of various Volksgeister (\\"national spirits\\"), the great men of history, such as Napoleon, are the \\"concrete universal\\". This has led some to claim that Hegel favored the great man theory, although his philosophy of history, in particular concerning the role of the \\"universal state\\" (Universalstaat, which means a universal \\"order\\" or \\"statute\\" rather than \\"state\\"), and of an \\"End of History\\" is much more complex. For Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by Geist or absolute spirit, by a \\"ruse of reason\\" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the teleological principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history. Weltgeist, the world spirit concept, designates an idealistic principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained objective reality as its product. (See metaphysical objectivism) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle all paid homage, amongst other things, to the concept of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it. Weltgeist Weltgeist \\"world-spirit\\" is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of \\"secularism, impiety, irreligiosity\\" (spiritus mundi), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of \\"man of the world\\", \\"mundane or secular person\\". Also from the 17th century, Weltgeist acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of \\"world-spirit\\" or \\"world-soul\\" (anima mundi, spiritus universi) in the sense of Panentheism, a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction between magnet and iron or between Moon and tide.Weltgeist in Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. This idea of Weltgeist in the sense of anima mundi became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, der Geist on its own could refer to this concept, as in Christian Thomasius, Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes (1709). Rudolf EislerW√∂rterbuch der philosophischen Begriffe (1904), 406ff., 1760f. Belief in a Weltgeist as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of Goethe, in the later part of the 18th century.Korff, Geist der G√∂thezeit (1923). Already in the poetical language of Johann Ulrich von K√∂nig (d. 1745), the Weltgeist appears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of Nature. J. U. von K√∂nig, Gedichte (1745) p. 253 Weltgeist in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of God and can be attributed agency and will. Herder, who tended to prefer the form Weltengeist (as it were \\"spirit of worlds\\"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit: : O Weltengeist, Bist du so g√ºtig, wie du m√§chtig bist, Enth√ºlle mir, den du mitf√ºhlend zwar, Und doch so grausam schufst, erkl√§re mir Das Loos der F√ºhlenden, die durch mich leiden. :\\"O World-spirit, be as benevolent as you are powerful and reveal to me, whom you have created with compassion and yet cruelly, explain to me the lot of the sentient, who suffer through me\\"Herder, \\"Die G√§rten der Hesperiden\\", Ausgew√§hlte Werke 1, ed. Kurz (1871), p. 223. \\"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena\\" (illustration from Harper's Magazine, 1895) The term was notably embraced by Hegel and his followers in the early 19th century. For the 19th century, the term as used by Hegel (1807) became prevalent, less in the sense of an animating principle of nature or the universe but as the invisible force advancing world history: :Im Gange der Geschichte ist das eine wesentliche Moment die Erhaltung eines Volkes [...] das andere Moment aber ist, da√ü der Bestand eines Volksgeistes, wie er ist, durchbrochen wird, weil er sich ausgesch√∂pft und ausgearbeitet hat, da√ü die Weltgeschichte, der Weltgeist fortgeht. :\\"In the course of history one relevant factor is the preservation of a nation [...] while the other factor is that the continued existence of a national spirit [Volksgeist] is interrupted because it has exhausted and spent itself, so that world history, the world spirit [Weltgeist], proceeds.\\" Hegel, Vorlesungen √ºber die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte (ed. 1944), 96f. Hegel's description of Napoleon as \\"the world-soul on horseback\\" (die Weltseele zu Pferde) became proverbial. The phrase is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in a letter written on 13 October 1806, the day before the Battle of Jena, to his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer: > I saw the Emperor ‚Äì this world-soul ‚Äì riding out of the city on > reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an > individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, > reaches out over the world and masters it. Hegel, letter of 13 October 1806 > to F. I. Niethammer, no. 74 (p. 119) in Briefe von und an Hegel ed. > Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schn√§delbach in Wolfgang Welsch, > Klaus Vieweg (eds.), Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht, > Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003), p. 223; trans. Pinkard (2000:228). The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859.L. Noack, Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik, 1859, p. 153 It is used without attribution by Meyer Kayserling in his Sephardim (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in G√∂ttingische gelehrte Anzeigen, who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's \\"bad jokes\\" (schlechte Witze).G√∂ttingische gelehrte Anzeigen 2 (1861) p. 770, The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century. e.g. G. Baur in Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universit√§t Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874 (1874), p. 36. Volksgeist Volksgeist or Nationalgeist refers to a \\"spirit\\" of an individual people (Volk), its \\"national spirit\\" or \\"national character\\". The term Nationalgeist is used in the 1760s by Justus M√∂ser and by Johann Gottfried Herder. The term Nation at this time is used in the sense of natio \\"nation, ethnic group, race\\", mostly replaced by the term Volk after 1800.Christoph M√§hrlein, Volksgeist und Recht. Hegels Philosophie der Einheit und ihre Bedeutung in der Rechtswissenschaft, K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, W√ºrzburg (2000), 17f. In the early 19th century, the term Volksgeist was used by Friedrich Carl von Savigny in order to express the \\"popular\\" sense of justice. Savigniy explicitly referred to the concept of an esprit des nations used by Voltaire.Essai sur les m≈ìurs et l‚Äôesprit des nations, 1756. and of the esprit g√©n√©ral invoked by Montesquieu.Vom Geist der Gesetze, 1748. Hegel uses the term in his Lectures on the Philosophy of History. Based on the Hegelian use of the term, Wilhelm Wundt, Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal in the mid-19th-century established the field of V√∂lkerpsychologie (\\"psychology of nations\\"). In Germany the concept of Volksgeist has developed and changed its meaning through eras and fields. The most important examples are: In the literary field, Schlegel and the Brothers Grimm. In the history of cultures, Herder. In the history of the State or political history, Hegel. In the field of law, Savigny and in the field of psychology Wundt.Azurmendi, Joxe: Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora, p. 65 This means that the concept is ambiguous. Furthermore it is not limited to Romanticism as it is commonly known.Azurmendi, Joxe: Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora, p. 285 The concept of was also influential in American cultural anthropology. According to the historian of anthropology George W. Stocking, Jr., \\"‚Ä¶ one may trace the later American anthropological idea of culture back through Bastian's Volkergedanken and the folk psychologist's Volksgeister to Wilhelm von Humboldt's Nationalcharakter -- and behind that, although not without a paradoxical and portentous residue of conceptual and ideological ambiguity, to the Herderian ideal of Volksgeist.\\" Zeitgeist The compound Zeitgeist (;oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com, \\"spirit of the age\\" or \\"spirit of the times\\") similarly to Weltgeist describes an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history. The term is now mostly associated with Hegel, contrasting with Hegel's use of Volksgeist \\"national spirit\\" and Weltgeist \\"world-spirit\\", but its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to Herder and Goethe.Zeitgeist \\"spirit of the epoch\\" and Nationalgeist \\"spirit of a nation\\" in L. Meister, Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte (1789). der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist (\\"the frivolous spirit of the world and the time\\") in Lavater, Handbibliothek f√ºr Freunde 5 (1791), p. 57. Zeitgeist is popularized by Herder and Goethe. Zeitgeist in Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. The term as used contemporarily may more pragmatically refer to a fashion or fad which prescribes what is acceptable or tasteful, e.g. in the field of architecture. Hegel in Phenomenology of the Spirit (1807) uses both Weltgeist and Volksgeist but prefers the phrase Geist der Zeiten \\"spirit of the times\\" over the compound Zeitgeist. c.f. use of the phrase (\\"the spirit of his time\\") in Lectures on the Philosophy of History, for example, \\"no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit.\\" Hegel believed that culture and art reflected its time. Thus, he argued that it would be impossible to produce classical art in the modern world, as modernity is essentially a \\"free and ethical culture\\".Hendrix, John Shannon. Aesthetics & The Philosophy Of Spirit. New York: Peter Lang. (2005). 4, 11. The term has also been used more widely in the sense of an intellectual or aesthetic fashion or fad. For example, Charles Darwin's 1859 proposition that evolution occurs by natural selection has been cited as a case of the zeitgeist of the epoch, an idea \\"whose time had come\\", seeing that his contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, was outlining similar models during the same period.Hothersall, D., \\"History of Psychology\\", 2004, Similarly, intellectual fashions such as the emergence of logical positivism in the 1920s, leading to a focus on behaviorism and blank-slatism over the following decades, and later, during the 1950s to 1960s, the shift from behaviorism to post-modernism and critical theory can be argued to be an expression of the intellectual or academic \\"zeitgeist\\". Zeitgeist in more recent usage has been used by Forsyth (2009) in reference to his \\"theory of leadership\\"Forsyth, D. R. (2009). Group dynamics: New York: Wadsworth. [Chapter 9] and in other publications describing models of business or industry. Malcolm Gladwell argued in his book Outliers that entrepreneurs who succeeded in the early stages of a nascent industry often share similar characteristics.

He subsequently became an advocate in Johannesburg. In 1940, he married Beryl Cynthia Gordon, after knowing her three weeks, and they moved to London, living in Old Compton Street during the Blitz. Writing under the pseudonyms Walter and Beryl Storm (to avoid anti-Semitism), they worked as war correspondents during the Second World War, and covered the Nuremberg trials after the war. The couple moved to Czechoslovakia and together they wrote the book We meet the Czechoslovaks, an account of their early years in Czechoslovakia, also under the Storm pseudonyms. Beryl later played an active role in editing, advising and typing the manuscripts for his subsequent books. Fearful for their security as Stalinism gained strength in post-war Eastern Europe, they returned to South Africa, and settled in Bramley, Johannesburg. In 1957, a few months after Bloom's first novel, Episode in the Transvaal, was published, the family moved to Cape Town.

Bloom worked with Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg in the 1950s. During the state of emergency that followed the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, he was detained for 45 days without charges or trial, first at Roeland Street Prison and later at Worcester Prison near Cape Town.

According to The Times, he came to England \\"in search of a new life, mainly as an academic and a journalist.\\" His wife and children stayed behind in South Africa. In 1967, Bloom was appointed Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Kent. With founding law professor Patrick Fitzgerald, he helped to set up the first Law Department at the University which was rooted in an interdisciplinary ethos. Bloom went on to collaborate with Igor Aleksander, now Emeritus Professor at Imperial College London, on the societal impact of computer networks and then worked for a newly set up Unit for Legal Research in Computer and Communications, which considered the legal protection of computer software and retrieval of statutes. This involved meetings with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations, which was created in 1967 \\"to encourage creative activity and to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world.\\" Many of the components of his work, and the articles he wrote, had a significant impact in the early days of the transition from the offline into the online world.

In order to get Amaterasu out of the cave the other gods called Yao-yorozu-no-kami threw a party outside with wisdom of Omoikane.

She became fascinated by her own reflection in the Yata no Kagami mirror which the other gods had crafted and hung before the cave for that purpose, and stood transfixed. Ame- no-tajikarao then forced the cave open and the world was bathed in light once again.

He has often been identified as a \\"white bluesman\\". Musselwhite was reportedly the inspiration for Elwood Blues; the character played by Dan Aykroyd in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. Biography Musselwhite was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi to white parents. Originally claiming to be of partly Choctaw descent, in a 2005 interview he said his mother had told him he was of distant Cherokee descent. His family considered it natural to play music. His father played guitar and harmonica, his mother played piano, and a relative was a one-man band. At the age of three, Musselwhite moved to Memphis, Tennessee. When he was a teenager, Memphis experienced the period when rockabilly, western swing, and electric blues were combining to give birth to rock and roll. That period featured Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and lesser-known musicians such as Gus Cannon, Furry Lewis, Will Shade, and Johnny Burnette. Musselwhite supported himself by digging ditches, laying concrete and running moonshine in a 1950 Lincoln automobile. This environment was a school for music as well as life for Musselwhite, who eventually acquired the nickname Memphis Charlie.\\"Charlie Musselwhite (Memphis Charlie)\\", Acoustic, Folk and Country Blues in the 21st Century In true bluesman fashion, Musselwhite then took off in search of the rumored \\"big- paying factory jobs\\" up the \\"Hillbilly Highway\\", Highway 51 to Chicago, where he continued his education on the South Side, making the acquaintance of even more legends, including Lew Soloff, Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Sonny Boy Williamson, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Big Walter Horton. Musselwhite immersed himself completely in the musical life, living in the basement of and occasionally working at Jazz Record Mart (the record store operated by Delmark Records founder Bob Koester) with Big Joe Williams and working as a driver for an exterminator, which allowed him to observe what was happening around the city's clubs and bars. He spent his time hanging out at the Jazz Record Mart, at the corner of State and Grand, and a nearby bar, Mr. Joe's, with the city's blues musicians, and sitting in with Williams and others in the clubs, playing for tips. There he forged a lifelong friendship with John Lee Hooker; though Hooker lived in Detroit, Michigan, the two often visited each other, and Hooker served as best man at Musselwhite's third marriage to Henrietta Musselwhite. Gradually Musselwhite became well known around town. In time, Musselwhite led his own blues band, and after Elektra Records' success with Paul Butterfield, he released the legendary album Stand Back! Here Comes Charley Musselwhite's Southside Band in 1966 on Vanguard Records to immediate and great success. He took advantage of the clout this album gave him to move to San Francisco, where, instead of being one of many competing blues acts, he held court as the king of the blues in the exploding countercultural music scene, an exotic and gritty figure to the flower children. Musselwhite even convinced Hooker to move to California. Since then, Musselwhite has released over 20 albums and has been a guest performer on albums by many other musicians, such as Bonnie Raitt's Longing in Their Hearts and the Blind Boys of Alabama's Spirit of the Century, both winners of Grammy Awards. He also performed on Tom Waits's Mule Variations and INXS's Suicide Blonde. He has won 14 Blues Music Awards, has been nominated for six Grammy Awards. received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Monterey Blues Festival and the San Javier Jazz Festival, in San Javier, Spain, and received the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts. In 1979, Musselwhite recorded The Harmonica According to Charlie Musselwhite in London for Kicking Mule Records, intended to accompany an instructional book; the album became so popular that it was released on CD. In June 2008, Blind Pig Records reissued the album on 180-gram vinyl with new cover art. Musselwhite at the Liri Blues Festival, Italy, in 2000 In 1990 Musselwhite signed with Alligator Records, a step that led to a resurgence of his career. In 1998, Musselwhite appeared in the film Blues Brothers 2000. He played the harmonica in the Louisiana Gator Boys, which featured many other blues and R&B; legends, such as B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Eric Clapton, Koko Taylor, Jimmie Vaughan, Dr. John, and Jack DeJohnette. Over the years, Musselwhite has branched out in style. His 1999 recording, Continental Drifter, is accompanied by Cuarteto Patria, from Cuba's Santiago region, the Cuban music counterpart of the Mississippi Delta. Because of political differences between Cuba and the United States, the album was recorded in Bergen, Norway, with Musselwhite's wife handling the details. Musselwhite believes the key to his musical success was finding a style in which he could express himself. He said, \\"I only know one tune, and I play it faster or slower, or I change the key, but it's just the one tune I've ever played in my life. It's all I know.\\" His past two albums, Sanctuary and Delta Hardware, were released by Real World Records. Musselwhite played on Tom Waits's 1999 album Mule Variations. He can be heard at the beginning of the song \\"Chocolate Jesus\\", saying \\"I love it\\". Waits has mentioned that this is his favorite part of the song. In 2002, he was featured on the Bo Diddley tribute album Hey Bo Diddley: A Tribute!, performing the song \\"Hey Bo Diddley\\". Musselwhite lost both of his elderly parents in December 2005, in separate incidents. His mother, Ruth Maxine Musselwhite, was murdered. Musselwhite joined the judging panel of the 10th annual Independent Music Awards, to assist independent musicians' careers. He was also a judge for the 7th and 9th Independent Music Awards. Musselwhite was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2010. The same year, he appeared on the JW-Jones recording \\"Midnight Memphis Sun\\", along with Hubert Sumlin. Also in 2010, he released the album The Well. In the title song he credits Jessica McClure's ordeal as a child trapped in a well for over 58 hours in 1987 for inspiring him to quit drinking, stating, > She was trapped in there with a broken arm in the dark, in a life-and-death > situation she was singing nursery rhymes to herself and being brave...It > made my problems seem tiny. So as a prayer to her and myself, I decided I > wasn't going to drink till she got out of that well. It was like I was > tricking myself, telling myself that I wasn't going to quit for good, just > until she got out. It took three days to get her out, and I haven't had a > drink since. For the first half of 2011, Musselwhite toured with the acoustic-electric blues band Hot Tuna. In the latter half of 2011, he went on tour with Cyndi Lauper, having played harmonica on her hit album Memphis Blues. While on this tour, he appeared with Lauper on Jools Holland's television program Hootenanny on New Year's Eve 2011, performing a modified arrangement of Lauper's signature song, \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\". In 2012, Musselewhite released the live album Juke Joint Chapel (recorded at the Shack Up Inn in Clarksdale, MS) which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album. Musselwhite also teamed with Ben Harper to record the album Get Up!, which was released in January 2013. In January 2014, it won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album. In 2014 and 2015, he won a Blues Music Award in the category Best Instrumentalist ‚Äì Harmonicist. At the 40th Blues Music Awards ceremony in 2019, Musselwhite's joint composition with Ben Harper, \\"No Mercy In This Land\\", was named as 'Song of the Year'. Discography *1967 Stand Back!

He is best known for his character Brozo el Payaso Tenebroso (Brozo the Creepy Clown), a green-haired, unkempt, obscene and aggressive clown (an anti-clown). Life Trujillo was born in Mexico City. In 1967, after appearing in an Imevisi√≥n variety show called En tienda y trastienda (Front and Back of House), Trujillo created a new program called La caravana (The Caravan), alongside his Tienda y trastienda partner Ausencio Cruz. La caravana was a successful show with skits played by characters created by Trujillo and Cruz, with a comedy style calling back to the era of carpas. It featured characters such as Estetoscopio Medina Ch√°irez, played by Trujillo, representing a low-class Mexican guy with a funny accent, who spoke ironically of the way of life of the poor. La caravana also marked the first on-air appearance of Brozo, where he told heavily modified fairy tales in front of the camera; the modifications reflected the realities of crime and poverty in the Mexican ghetto. The success of the two programs brought advertising revenues to Imevisi√≥n, which by the early 1990s was airing steadily more foreign productions. Trujillo later had a nighttime program as another character, \\"La Beba Galv√°n\\", this time without Cruz. Trujillo continued with TV Azteca, Imevisi√≥n's successor, hosting programs including El Diario de la Noche until 2000. That year, he brought his act to Canal 40, where Brozo was host of his own news program called El Ma√±anero as an anchorman and political commentator. An obvious intelligent man behind the make-up of a clown, Victor Trujillo could criticize freely and poignantly the actors of the political scene (not very reputed among the general public), and soon his program received high ratings and featured high-profile politicians; it also began being simulcast on some Grupo ACIR radio stations. Career at Televisa In 2001, after 16 months, Trujillo left Canal 40 in order to sign a contract with Televisa and move his program there, which he said would allow him to take on a wider variety of projects. For instance, he appeared on programs surrounding the 2002 FIFA World Cup and hosted a season of Big Brother M√©xico. Brozo played an important role in the most damaging of the videoscandals that affected Mexico City mayor Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. On El Ma√±anero, a video given to Trujillo by then-ALDF deputy Federico D√∂ring Casar was publicly played, showing Ren√© Bejarano filling a briefcase with dollars given by entrepreneur Carlos Ahumada; this was followed immediately by a studio interview with an unsuspecting Bejarano, who saw the video for the first time on the spot. Trujillo would later be called on to testify in the criminal case that resulted. After the 2004 death of Carolina Padilla (both his wife and his program's producer) due to a brain hemorrhage suffered the year before, Trujillo cancelled El Ma√±anero, stating that he was putting Brozo \\"in the freezer\\". Some time later, he started a new, similar show called El cristal con que se mira (The Looking Glass), this time as himself. In 2005, Trujillo caused the downfall of PRI presidential precandidate Arturo Montiel, when he announced as confirmed a current inquiry on Montiel's family and personal fortune. This inquiry was later denied by the government, but the damage was done, and Montiel quit the presidential race a few days later. After El Cristal, along with El Circo de Brozo‚Äîa program that marked the return of the Brozo character‚Äîwere cancelled in 2006, Trujillo (as Brozo) had another nighttime show called \\"El NotiFiero\\". In 2010, however, El Ma√±anero returned to the air, this time on Televisa's news channel FOROtv. It left the air in 2016 as part of a larger reorganization of Televisa's news output and to make way for a new weekly program on Canal 2. Dubbing and voiceovers Trujillo as Brozo Trujillo has lent his voice to a variety of animated and other series, as well as Spanish-language dubs for the Mexican market. Among his more notable roles in this capacity have been Lion-O in ThunderCats, James Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Sulley in Monsters, Inc. and Monsters University and Shere Khan in the Mexican release of The Jungle Book. Other works In 2006, Trujillo released Cuentos Tenebrozos, a collection of \\"true\\" short stories.

It is the only species in the genus Sanguinaria, included in the family Papaveraceae, and most closely related to Eomecon of eastern Asia. Sanguinaria canadensis is also known as Canada puccoon, bloodwort, redroot, red puccoon, and sometimes pauson. It has also been known as tetterwort, although that name is also used to refer to Chelidonium majus. Plants are variable in leaf and flower shape and have in the past been separated out as different subspecies due to these variable shapes. Currently most taxonomic treatments include these different forms in one highly variable species. In bloodroot, the juice is red and poisonous. Description Bloodroot grows from tall. It has one large basal leaf, up to across, with five to seven lobes. The leaves and flowers sprout from a reddish rhizome with bright orange sap that grows at or slightly below the soil surface. The color of the sap is the reason for the genus name Sanguinaria, from Latin \\"bloody\\". The rhizomes grow longer each year, and branch to form colonies. Plants start to bloom before the foliage unfolds in early spring. After blooming the leaves unfurl to their full size and go summer dormant in mid to late summer, later than some other spring ephemerals. The flowers bloom from March to May depending on the region and weather. They have 8‚Äì12 delicate white petals, many yellow stamens, and two sepals below the petals, which fall off after the flowers open. Each flower stem is clasped by a leaf as it emerges from the ground. The flowers open when they are in sunlight. They are pollinated by small bees and flies. Seeds develop in green pods long, and ripen before the foliage goes dormant. The seeds are round and black to orange-red when ripe, and have white elaiosomes, which are eaten by ants.

Sanguinaria canadensis plants are found growing in moist to dry woods and thickets, often on floodplains and near shores or streams on slopes. They grow less frequently in clearings and meadows or on dunes, and are rarely found in disturbed sites. Deer will feed on the plants in early spring. Ecology Bloodroot is one of many plants whose seeds are spread by ants, a process called myrmecochory. The seeds have a fleshy organ called an elaiosome that attracts ants. The ants take the seeds to their nest, where they eat the elaiosomes, and put the seeds in their nest debris, where they are protected until they germinate. They also benefit from growing in a medium made richer by the ant nest debris. The flowers produce pollen, but no nectar. Various bees and flies visit the flowers looking in vain for nectar, for instance sweat bees in the genera Lasioglossum and Halictus, cuckoo bees in the genus Nomada, small carpenter bees (Ceratina), and bee flies in the genus Bombylius. Some bees come to collect pollen, including mining bees (Andrena), which are the most effective pollinators. The bitter and toxic leaves and rhizomes are not often eaten by mammalian herbivores. Cultivation A double-flowered form Sanguinaria canadensis is cultivated as an ornamental plant. The double-flowered forms are prized by gardeners for their large showy white flowers, which are produced very early in the gardening season. Bloodroot flower petals are shed within a day or two of pollination, so the flower display is short-lived, but the double forms bloom much longer than the normal forms. The double flowers are made up of stamens that have been changed into petal-like parts, making pollination more difficult. The double-flowered cultivar S. canadensis f. multiplex 'Plena' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Toxicity Bloodroot produces benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, primarily the toxin sanguinarine. The alkaloids are transported to and stored in the rhizome. Sanguinarine kills animal cells by blocking the action of Na+/K+-ATPase transmembrane proteins. As a result, applying bloodroot to the skin may destroy tissue and lead to the formation of necrotic tissue, called an eschar. Bloodroot and its extracts are thus considered escharotic. Although applying escharotic agents (including bloodroot) to the skin is sometimes suggested as a home treatment for skin cancer, these attempts can be severely disfiguring.Don't Use Corrosive Cancer Salves (Escharotics), Stephen Barrett, M.D. Salves, most notably black salve, derived from bloodroot do not remove tumors. Microscopic tumor deposits may remain after visible tumor tissue is burned away, and case reports have shown that in such instances tumor has recurred and/or metastasized. Internal use is not recommended. An overdose of bloodroot extract can cause vomiting and loss of consciousness. Alkaloid biosynthesis Comparing the biosynthesis of morphine and sanguinarine, the final intermediate in common is (S)-reticuline. A number of plants in Papaveraceae and Ranunculaceae, as well as plants in the genus Colchicum (family Colchicaceae) and genus Chondodendron (family Menispermaceae), also produce such benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Plant geneticists have identified and sequenced genes which produce the enzymes required for this production. One enzyme involved is N-methylcoclaurine 3'-monooxygenase, which produces (S)-3'-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine and mendococlaurine from (S)-N-methylcoclaurine. Uses=Alternative medicine Bloodroot was used historically by Native Americans for curative properties as an emetic, respiratory aid, and other treatments.Native American Ethnobotany (University of Michigan ‚Äì Dearborn: Sanguinaria canadensis . accessed 12.1.2011 In physician William Cook's 1869 work The Physiomedical Dispensatory is a chapter on the uses and preparations of bloodroot,Sanguinaria Canadensis.  Henriette's Herbal Homepage which described tinctures and extractions, and also included the following cautionary report: Greater celandine (Chelidonium majus), a member of the poppy family, was used in colonial America as a wart remedy. Bloodroot has been similarly applied in the past. This may explain the multiple American and British definitions of \\"tetterwort\\" . Bloodroot extracts have also been promoted by some supplement companies as a treatment or cure for cancer, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has listed some of these products among its \\"187 Fake Cancer 'Cures' Consumers Should Avoid\\". Oral use of products containing bloodroot are strongly associated with the development of oral leukoplakia, which is a premalignant lesion that may develop into oral cancer. However, a review by Canadian scientists in the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology found that there was no evidence that these products cause leukoplakia, and that the study claiming such cause suffered from selection and information bias, and from potential confounding. Bloodroot in Sydenham Edwards's The Botanical Magazine (1791) This plant has also been used in medical quackery, as was evidenced by the special product produced by Dr. John Henry Pinkard during the 1920s and 1930s. Some bottles of \\"Pinkard's Sanguinaria Compound\\", made from bloodroot or bloodwort, were seized by federal officials in 1931. \\"Analysis by this department of a sample of the article showed that it consisted essentially of extracts of plant drugs including sanguinaria, sugar, alcohol, and water. It was alleged in the information that the article was misbranded in that certain statements, designs, and devices regarding the therapeutic and curative effects of the article, appearing on the bottle label, falsely and fraudulently represented that it would be effective as a treatment, remedy, and cure for pneumonia, coughs, weak lungs, asthma, kidney, liver, bladder, or any stomach troubles, and effective as a great blood and nerve tonic.\\" John Henry Pinkard plead guilty and was fined $25.00.Case #19890.

Commercial uses Commercial uses of sanguinarine and bloodroot extract include dental hygiene products. The United States FDA has approved the inclusion of sanguinarine in toothpastes as an antibacterial or anti-plaque agent.How to Report Problems With Products Regulated by FDA However, the use of sanguinaria in oral hygiene products is associated with the development of a premalignant oral leukoplakia,which may develop into oral cancer.Leukoplakia , hosted by the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Page accessed on December 19, 2006.

BidPay was rebranded as \\"Western Union Auction Payments\\" in 2003 which led to confusion with Western Union's wire transfer services; the online auction payment service reverted to the BidPay name in 2004. BidPay ceased operations on 31 December 2005 and was purchased for US$1.8 million in March 2006 by CyberSource Corporation, which announced its intention to relaunch BidPay. BidPay had over 4 million registered users worldwide at that time. BidPay was a popular payment method for auction sellers based in North America because there was no chargeback or reversal risk, as there was with competing services such as PayPal. The buyer of an item or service was responsible for all fees, and US sellers had the option of receiving an ACH payment direct into their bank account. However, when a buyer successfully made a chargeback in a disputed transaction, BidPay ended up taking the loss rather than the seller. BidPay was relaunched in June 2006 based on an operating model similar to that of a merchant account for auction sales. Sellers were now responsible for all fees and had to have a US-based bank account that accepted ACH payments since money orders were no longer issued. Before approving payment, Bidpay reviewed payments via automated fraud checks. Also, sellers had to ship by a track and trace shipper. Bidpay would assume the risk of chargebacks if the seller followed all the requirements under the user agreement. BidPay.com, Inc. finally discontinued operations on December 31, 2007.

Services provided across connections in an MMR may be voice circuits, data circuits, or Internet protocol traffic. An MMR provides a safe production environment where the carrier handover point equipment can be expected to run on a 24/7 basis with minimal risk of interruption. It is typically located within the data center. To interconnect, companies order a patch from their cage or suite to the MMR, and then arrange for the organization running the facility to connect them together. These physical connections may be an optical fiber cable, coaxial cable, twisted pair, or any other networking medium. Typically, a meet-me room will discourage or disallow customers from installing large amounts of equipment. However, multiplexing equipment is often welcome in the meet-me room, so that a customer can have a single connection between the room and the rest of their equipment in the building, and the multiplexing equipment can then break that out to allow for direct, private connections to several other organizations present in the meet me room. An Internet exchange point can also be present in a meet-me room to allow many organizations in the meet me room to interchange traffic without having to make physical interconnections between every possible pair of organizations.

Fertig was born in Chicago, Illinois. Often erroneously credited as a founder of the group, Sister Boom Boom actually joined the Sisters in 1980, several months after its founding. She left the order in the Spring of 1986. Her full name was Sister Rose of the Bloody Stains of the Sacred Robes of Jesus, which would trail into a sing-song cadence and a long fermata. This called for a short nickname. In 1982, Sister Boom Boom ran for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors with agitprop campaigning tactics bringing humor and raising issues she felt were being ignored in the race. She won 23,124 votes with her occupation listed as \\"Nun of the Above\\". Five supervisors were elected; she placed eighth. After she started campaigning for mayor in 1983 against incumbent Dianne Feinstein, San Francisco passed an ordinance requiring candidates to use only their legal names on the ballot. This was commonly called the \\"Sister Boom Boom law\\". Boom Boom wrote a theatrical-ritual exorcism of Jerry Falwell and Phyllis Schlafly performed in Union Square on July 13, the Friday before the 1984 Democratic National Convention before a crowd of 2,000. She is one of the characters in Emily Mann's play Execution of Justice about the trial of Dan White for the 1978 Moscone‚ÄìMilk assassinations. George Moscone was mayor of San Francisco and Harvey Milk was the city‚Äôs first openly gay supervisor. In the Broadway production she was played by Wesley Snipes. Jack Fertig retired Sister Boom Boom in 1985, and joined a sobriety program. Born to a Jewish father and a Christian mother, he converted to Islam in 2001.

The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the season, Francelia developed from a tropical wave in the southeastern Caribbean Sea on August 29\\\\. It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. On September 1, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. While approaching Central America, the storm intensified and peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane on September 2\\\\. Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize (then British Honduras) late on September 3\\\\. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day. During its early stages, Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea. While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America, heavy precipitation fell in some countries, especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused $15 million in damage. In neighboring Honduras, the hurricane struck after the undeclared Football War, causing additional damage in the northern portions of the country. Damage in Honduras was heaviest on the offshore Bay Islands, and the hurricane damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns there. In El Salvador, flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage. Several rivers in the region flooded, with the Belize River reaching above normal. Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service, and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops. Francelia ranked as the deadliest tropical cyclone in Guatemala, until Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Overall damage was estimated at $35.6 million, and there were 271 deaths. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Francelia were from a tropical wave - an elongated low pressure area - that exited the western coast of Africa on August 19\\\\. It moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and the annual summary of 1969 tropical cyclone activity indicated there may have been a tropical depression - a cyclone with sustained winds of less 40 mph (75 km/h) - briefly located within the system. On August 26, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, developed along the wave, about 800 miles (1300 km) east of Barbados. A Hurricane Hunters flight two days later reported no low-level circulation. As the system moved through the southern Lesser Antilles, ship and land observations suggested a circulation had developed, signalling the formation of a tropical depression in the extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea early on August 29. The new tropical cyclone moved quickly west-northwestward away from South America, and on August 30 reconnaissance aircraft recorded winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Based on the observation, the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Francelia. Strengthening continued to near hurricane-force, but the fast-moving circulation outran the convection, causing brief weakening as it passed south of Jamaica. Although initially forecast to continue to the west-northwest, Francelia slowed and turned to the west-southwest on September 1 due to a ridge to its north. Concurrently, the storm intensified into hurricane status after its winds reached 75 mph (120 km/h), and late on September 1 Francelia passed over Swan Island. During its passage, an atmospheric sounding occurred in its eye; a sounding is a measurement of the physical properties of the atmosphere, and the process had only occurred four times previously. Hurricane Francelia continued west-southwestward toward the northern coast of Central America, strengthening significantly despite its proximity to land. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September 2 reported winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum pressure of as the hurricane crossed over the Bay Islands, only 30 miles (50 km) off the coast of Honduras. Francelia weakened slightly as its forward movement slowed, but it remained a hurricane as it approached land, based on confirmation from ship reports. Late on September 3, the hurricane made landfall with winds estimated at 110 mph (180 km/h), just north of Punta Gorda in southern Belize, then known as British Honduras. Tropical storm force winds spread across the country, although hurricane-force winds occurred only in a small area near where the hurricane made landfall. Francelia weakened quickly over land, dissipating late on September 4 over Guatemala. The system continued slowly across Central America, crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean three days after it moved ashore. On September 8, the remnants of Francelia redeveloped into Tropical Storm Glenda off the coast of Mexico, which moved parallel to the southwest Mexican coast before dissipating on September 12. Impact Image of a washed out bridge along the Achiguate River As a developing tropical cyclone, Francelia brought gusty winds to several islands across the eastern Caribbean. A few days later, it passed south of Jamaica, and winds of around 30 mph (50 km/h) were recorded, and there was heavy rainfall. Shortly thereafter, the eye of Francelia crossed over Grand Cayman, producing in a 16‚Äëhour period. On Swan Island, located about 90 miles (145 km) offshore Honduras, Francelia produced peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). A station on the island recorded a minimum pressure of , as well as of rainfall during the storm's passage. Before Francelia made its final landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued warnings for countries in the western Caribbean, although there were few observations confirming the track while it was active due to inadequate regional weather stations and lack of the Hurricane Hunters close to land. When Francelia nearly stalled off the coast of Central America, it brought prolonged rainfall and extensive flooding. In Guatemala, daily rainfall reached 7.27 in (184.6 mm) at a station along the Achiguate River, and totals reached about in some mountainous areas. Along the Belizean coast, the hurricane produced a storm tide of about . Mountain rainfall resulted in overflown rivers, with the Belize River rising to over above normal. The hurricane forced over 20,000 people to evacuate their homes. Offshore northern Honduras, the Bay Islands experienced heavy rainfall and high tides from the hurricane. Most of the houses in French Harbor were damaged or destroyed, leaving 400 families homeless. About half of the town of Coxen Hole on Roat√°n was destroyed, and the rest of the buildings were damaged. Damage was less severe on √ötila and Guanaja islands. Francelia flooded most of the northern coast of Honduras, inundating the airport in San Pedro Sula to a depth of . In San Pedro Sula, the storm cut the water supply for several days, and the floods cut road and rail links between there and Puerto Cort√©s along the coast. Across the region, Francelia caused widespread power outages. Along the Ul√∫a River, several residents were stranded when their cars stalled in flooded roadways. The floods wrecked four bridges on a road between La Lima and Tela. Flooding also ruined over 50% of the United Fruit Company's banana crop, forcing over to be replaced. Banana damage totaled $4.7 million, and United Fruit estimated it would take two years to reach production levels before the hurricane. Other damaged crops included corn, sugar, coconut, and bean. Nationwide, the hurricane destroyed about 1,000 houses, leaving 5,000 people homeless. Damage was estimated at $19 million. In neighboring Guatemala, Francelia caused flash flooding along the Pacific coast due to the heavy rainfall. The rains overflowed rivers, canals, and the crater lake of Volc√°n de Agua, causing widespread landslides. The floods and landslides wrecked highways, rail lines, and many boats, leaving several towns isolated. A portion of the Pan-American Highway was washed out in the country's western portion, and another bridge was destroyed by a landslide between Quetzaltenango and Huehuetenango; landslides also forced the closure of two roads in Quich√© Department. In Amatitl√°n, the floods covered the entire town with mud to shoulder-height. Five entire towns were largely destroyed, leaving 10,200 people homeless nationwide. Francelia destroyed 1,704 houses, mostly along rivers and in landslide zones. The floods also damaged power lines and crops. Throughout the country, the hurricane killed 269 people and caused $15 million in damage. Francelia's rainfall extended into El Salvador, where about 1,000 homes were flooded along the Lempa River. Isolated residents along the Paz River required food to be airdropped. The floods damaged corn and sorghum crops, and some livestock were killed. Francelia destroyed 42 houses in El Salvador, destroyed a bridge, and caused $1.6 million in damage. The hurricane killed two people and injured 40 others. Heavy damage also occurred along the Belize coast, and communications were cut. The storm caused extensive damage to crops, including heavy losses to the banana industry. High waves and heavy rainfall caused power outages and flooded coastal roadways. Aftermath By September 5, or two days after the hurricane's landfall, floods were receding across Honduras, and flights were restored to the Bay Islands. Floods receded a day later in Guatemala and not until September 9 in El Salvador. Shortly after Francelia struck the Bay Islands, the Honduran health ministry flew a doctor and nurse with medical supplies to the islands. Undamaged boats were used to transport people and supplies to the islands, utilizing relief goods intended for the recovery after a war earlier in 1969. In Guatemala, the president organized the National Emergency Committee to coordinate disaster relief, but after few organizations complied, there was duplicate relief work in some areas and no assistance in other areas. The Guatemalan Red Cross and the country's air force and army helped in the relief efforts. Citizens throughout the country donated over $200,000 worth of food and clothing. The government made widespread road and bridge repairs following the floods with the assistance of the United States, installing two Bailey bridges that were completed by early November; there were delays installing the bridges due to persistent unsettled weather. The United States ultimately provided $281,659 in aid to the country, mostly through the road reconstruction and C-rations. Other countries and Red Cross chapters sent money to Guatemala, including 10 tons of medicine from Brazil, 500 blankets from Chile, and 200 bottles of snake bite serum from Costa Rica. El Salvador also received assistance from the United States, including food and blankets.

Smith was the third Miss USA of African-American origin, after Carole Gist (1990) and Kenya Moore (1993), in addition to being the sixth American woman to win Miss Universe and the first since Shawn Weatherly was crowned Miss Universe 1980. Early life Smith was born in Redwood City, California, to 19-year-old parents Craig Smith, an African-American maintenance man, and Mary Denise Trimble, a white American secretary. Her parents divorced before she was two, and her mother, an alcoholic at the time, granted Smith's maternal grandparents Barnie and Jeanette custody of her. When Smith was seven, she moved with her grandparents to Kingwood, Texas, where they would later get divorced as well, causing Smith to grow up in a divided home while she attended high school in Deer Park. Prior to her win at Miss USA, she was a sophomore majoring in education at San Jacinto College.  Beauty pageant career =Miss Texas USA Smith competed in her first major beauty contest in 1994, when she was a semifinalist in the Miss Texas USA pageant, as Miss South East Texas USA. The following year she competed again as Miss Galveston County USA, and won the title, as well as the Miss Congeniality award. Smith, a multiracial American, was the first titleholder of African-American heritage in the pageant's history. Miss USA Smith went on to compete in the 1995 Miss USA pageant on February 10, 1995. During the final telecast, Smith obtained the highest average preliminary score and entering the semifinals in first place, becoming the fourth consecutive woman from her state to make the semifinals. She became a semifinalist, and advanced to the top six in first place. The next two rounds of competition: the Top 6 judges' questions and the Top 3 final question. When asked how she, as an advisor, would change the First Lady's image if asked for a consultation, Smith replied: \\"I would tell her not to change her image, actually. I believe very strongly in who I am, and I've seen 50 ladies tonight who believe very strongly in who they are, and I really think that she wouldn't have made it as far as she has if she wouldn't have been herself, so I really truly think she should stay exactly the way she is.\\" She became the seventh woman from her state to hold the Miss USA title and also won the Miss Congeniality award as she had at her state pageant, becoming the only Miss USA winner and Miss Texas USA in history to win this award. After her crowning, Smith was a celebrity contestant on Wheel of Fortune and an award presenter at the People's Choice Awards. Miss Universe After becoming Miss USA, Smith traveled to Windhoek, Namibia, to compete in the 1995 Miss Universe pageant, broadcast live from Windhoek Country Club on May 12, 1995. She was again the highest placed contestant after the preliminary competition, which propelled her into the top ten. Once again, Smith was among the final 3 contestants and went on to win the title ahead of first runner-up Manpreet Brar of India, becoming the first Miss USA and sixth representative to capture the Miss Universe crown in 15 years. Life after Miss Universe As a model, Smith worked for Hawaiian Tropic, Jantzen, Pontiac, Venus Swimwear, and Pure Protein among others. She made appearances on Martin, Due South and the TLC documentary The History of the Bathing Suit. With the support of Music World Entertainment/Sony, Smith co-wrote and recorded with producer Damon Elliott her first single, \\"Dom Da Da\\", part of the soundtrack for The Sweetest Thing, starring Cameron Diaz. In 2003, she acted in the independent film Playas Ball, where she co-starred with Allen Payne and Elise Neal. She also co-hosted Beyonc√© Knowles' special Beyonce: Family and Friends Tour on pay-per-view and appeared on HBO in Saladin Patterson's short film One Flight Stand with Marc Blucas and Aisha Tyler. She was a judge at the 2006 Miss Teen USA pageant. and was a guest judge for the Miss Peru 2016 beauty pageant. In 2011, she was presented the Influential Multiracial Public Figure award. Smith married fitness coach Kelly Blair after her reign as Miss Universe and moved to Los Angeles. They later divorced. Death Smith was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2017. Growing increasingly weak throughout 2018, she traveled to her mother's home in Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and she died there at the age of 45 on September 8, 2018.

While environmentalism focuses more on the environmental and nature-related aspects of green ideology and politics, ecology combines the ideology of social ecology and environmentalism. Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and improvement of the natural environment and critical earth system elements or processes such as the climate, and may be referred to as a movement to control pollution or protect plant and animal diversity. For this reason, concepts such as a land ethic, environmental ethics, biodiversity, ecology, and the biophilia hypothesis figure predominantly. At its crux, environmentalism is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend in such a way that all the components are accorded a proper degree of sustainability. The exact measures and outcomes of this balance is controversial and there are many different ways for environmental concerns to be expressed in practice. Environmentalism and environmental concerns are often represented by the colour green, but this association has been appropriated by the marketing industries for the tactic known as greenwashing. Environmentalism is opposed by anti-environmentalism, which says that the Earth is less fragile than some environmentalists maintain, and portrays environmentalism as overreacting to the human contribution to climate change or opposing human advancement. Definitions Environmentalism denotes a social movement that seeks to influence the political process by lobbying, activism, and education in order to protect natural resources and ecosystems. An environmentalist is a person who may speak out about our natural environment and the sustainable management of its resources through changes in public policy or individual behaviour. This may include supporting practices such as informed consumption, conservation initiatives, investment in renewable resources, improved efficiencies in the materials economy, transitioning to new accounting paradigms such as Ecological economics, renewing and revitalizing our connections with non-human life or even opting to have one less child to reduce consumption and pressure on resources. In various ways (for example, grassroots activism and protests), environmentalists and environmental organisations seek to give the natural world a stronger voice in human affairs.Robert Gottlieb, Forcing the Spring: The Transformation of the American Environmental Movement (2005) In general terms, environmentalists advocate the sustainable management of resources, and the protection (and restoration, when necessary) of the natural environment through changes in public policy and individual behaviour. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in ecosystems, the movement is centered around ecology, health, and human rights. History Lord Mahavira, the last Jain Tirthankar is also considered to be a great environmentalist. A concern for environmental protection has recurred in diverse forms, in different parts of the world, throughout history. The earliest ideas of environment protectionism can be traced in Jainism, which was revived by Mahavira in 6th century BC in ancient India. Jainism offers a view that may seem readily compatible with core values associated with environmental activism, i.e., protection of life by nonviolence; which could form the basis of strong ecological ethos thus adding its voice to global calls for protection of environment. His teachings on the symbiosis between all living beings and the five elements‚Äîearth, water, air, fire, and space‚Äîform the basis of environmental sciences today. In Europe, King Edward I of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem. The fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow. Earlier in the Middle East, the Caliph Abu Bakr in the 630s commanded his army to \\"Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire,\\" and \\"Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food.\\" Arabic medical treatises during the 9th to 13th centuries dealing with environmentalism and environmental science, including pollution, were written by Al-Kindi, Qusta ibn Luqa, Al-Razi, Ibn Al-Jazzar, al-Tamimi, al-Masihi, Avicenna, Ali ibn Ridwan, Ibn Jumay, Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Abd-el-latif, Ibn al-Quff, and Ibn al-Nafis. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution, such as air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, municipal solid waste mishandling, and environmental impact assessments of certain localities. Early environmental legislation Levels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century. The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's Alkali Acts, passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution (gaseous hydrochloric acid) given off by the Leblanc process, used to produce soda ash. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted smoke, grit, dust and fumes under supervision. In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.Harold L. Platt, Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago (2005) excerpt. Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The Coal Smoke Abatement Society was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations. During the Spanish Revolution, anarchist-controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms, which were possibly the largest in the world at the time. Daniel Guerin notes that anarchist territories would diversify crops, extend irrigation, initiate reforestation, start tree nurseries and help to establish naturist communities. Once there was a link discovered between air pollution and tuberculosis, the CNT shut down several metal factories.Iain McKay, \\"Objectivity and Right-Libertarian Scholarship,\\" 20 January 2009, http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/caplan.html. It was only under the impetus of the Great Smog of 1952 in London, which almost brought the city to a standstill and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths, that the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed and airborne pollution in the city was first tackled. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities. The act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism, and caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people's quality of life. The late 19th century also saw the passage of the first wildlife conservation laws. The zoologist Alfred Newton published a series of investigations into the Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and influenced the passage of the Sea Birds Preservation Act in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world. First environmental movements Early interest in the environment was a feature of the Romantic movement in the early 19th century. One of the earliest modern pronouncements on thinking about human industrial advancement and its influence on the environment was written by Japanese geographer, educator, philosopher and author Tsunesaburo Makiguchi in his 1903 publication Jinsei Chirigaku (A Geography of Human Life). In Britain the poet William Wordsworth travelled extensively in the Lake District and wrote that it is a \\"sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\\". John Ruskin an influential thinker who articulated the Romantic ideal of environmental protection and conservation. Systematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to industrialisation, the growth of cities, and worsening air and water pollution. Starting with the formation of the Commons Preservation Society in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. Robert Hunter, solicitor for the society, worked with Hardwicke Rawnsley, Octavia Hill, and John Ruskin to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of Newlands and Ennerdale. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).\\"Canon Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley\\" , Visitcumbria.com, accessed 17 May 2009 Peter Kropotkin wrote about ecology in economics, agricultural science, conservation, ethology, criminology, urban planning, geography, geology and biology. He observed in Swiss and Siberian glaciers that they had been slowly melting since the dawn of the industrial revolution, possibly making him one of the first predictors for climate change. He also observed the damage done from deforestation and hunting. Kropotkin's writings would become influential in the 1970s and became a major inspiration for the intentional community movement as well as his ideas becoming the basis for the theory of social ecology. In 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the \\"National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\\" was formally inaugurated in 1894.\\"A Proposed National Trust\\", The Times, 17 July 1894, p. 12 The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation.\\"Parliamentary Committees\\", The Times, 26 July 1907. p. 4 and the bill was passed in August 1907.\\"An Act to incorporate and confer powers upon the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\\" , The National Trust, accessed 4 June 2012 An early \\"Back-to-Nature\\" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as John Ruskin, William Morris, George Bernard Shaw and Edward Carpenter, who were all against consumerism, pollution and other activities that were harmful to the natural world.Gould, Peter C. (1988). Early Green Politics, Brighton, Harvester Press, pp. 15‚Äì19, and Wall, Derek, (1994) Green History: A Reader. London, Routledge, pp. 9‚Äì14. The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical utopia and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it. Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the \\"taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality\\", were enthusiastically revived, including the Morris dance and the maypole. These ideas also inspired various environmental groups in the UK, such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, established in 1889 by Emily Williamson as a protest group to campaign for greater protection for the indigenous birds of the island. The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. By 1900, public support for the organisation had grown, and it had over 25,000 members. The Garden city movement incorporated many environmental concerns into its urban planning manifesto; the Socialist League and The Clarion movement also began to advocate measures of nature conservation.Gould, (1988) pp. 16, 23‚Äì24, 36‚Äì38, 84‚Äì86. Original title page of Walden by Henry David Thoreau. The movement in the United States began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book Walden, which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in Yosemite Valley and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form Yosemite National Park and went on to set up the Sierra Club in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism. In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the American bison. The death of the last passenger pigeon as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and to popularise their concerns. In 1916, the National Park Service was founded by US President Woodrow Wilson. The Forestry Commission was set up in 1919 in Britain to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for afforestation and reforestation. The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade. During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes. By 1939 the Forestry Commission was the largest landowner in Britain. During the 1930s the Nazis had elements that were supportive of animal rights, zoos and wildlife, and took several measures to ensure their protection. In 1933 the government created a stringent animal-protection law and in 1934, Das Reichsjagdgesetz (The Reich Hunting Law) was enacted which limited hunting.Hartmut M. Hanauske-Abel, Not a slippery slope or sudden subversion: German medicine and National Socialism in 1933, BMJ 1996; pp. 1453‚Äì1463 (7 December) Several Nazis were environmentalists (notably Rudolf Hess), and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the regime. In 1935, the regime enacted the \\"Reich Nature Protection Act\\" (Reichsnaturschutzgesetz). The concept of the Dauerwald (best translated as the \\"perpetual forest\\") which included concepts such as forest management and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb air pollution.Jonathan Olsen \\"How Green Were the Nazis? Nature, Environment, and Nation in the Third Reich (review)\\" Technology and Culture ‚Äì Volume 48, Number 1, January 2007, pp. 207‚Äì08 In 1949, A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold was published. It explained Leopold's belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organisations. David Brower, Ansel Adams and Nancy Newhall created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. \\"This Is Dinosaur\\" edited by Wallace Stegner with photographs by Martin Litton and Philip Hyde prevented the building of dams within Dinosaur National Monument by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard- hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of Yosemite National Park, when photographs persuaded Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanised public opposition to building dams in the Grand Canyon and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the Wilderness Society and many others. After a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population concern, and curbing the exploitation of natural resources. Post-war expansion In 1962, Silent Spring by American biologist Rachel Carson was published. The book cataloged the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of DDT in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. The resulting public concern led to the creation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 which subsequently banned the agricultural use of DDT in the US in 1972. The limited use of DDT in disease vector control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial. The book's legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth (US), as well as notable local organisations such as the Wyoming Outdoor Council, which was founded in 1967. In the 1970s, the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the counterculture movement./http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/opinion/in-praise-of-the- counterculture.html The world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the United Tasmania Group Tasmania, Australia and the Values Party of New Zealand.Bevan, RA (2001), Petra Kelly: The Other Green, New Political Science, vol. 23, no. 2, November, pp. 181‚Äì202 The first green party in Europe was the Popular Movement for the Environment, founded in 1972 in the Swiss canton of Neuch√¢tel. The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the Ecology Party, and then the Green Party. Protection of the environment also became important in the developing world; the Chipko movement was formed in India under the influence of Mhatmas Gandhi and they set up peaceful resistance to deforestation by literally hugging trees (leading to the term \\"tree huggers\\"). Their peaceful methods of protest and slogan \\"ecology is permanent economy\\" were very influential. Another milestone in the movement was the creation of Earth Day. Earth Day was first observed in San Francisco and other cities on 21 March 1970, the first day of spring. It was created to give awareness to environmental issues. On 21 March 1971, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of a spaceship Earth on Earth Day, hereby referring to the ecosystem services the earth supplies to us, and hence our obligation to protect it (and with it, ourselves). Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network, and is celebrated in more than 192 countries every year. The UN's first major conference on international environmental issues, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (also known as the Stockholm Conference), was held on 5‚Äì16 June 1972. It marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics.John Baylis, Steve Smith. 2005. The Globalization of World Politics (3rd ed). Oxford. Oxford University Press. pp. 454‚Äì55 By the mid-1970s, many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe. The Back-to- the-land movement started to form and ideas of environmental ethics joined with anti-Vietnam War sentiments and other political issues. These individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as deep ecology. Around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 and the formation of CITES in 1975. Significant amendments were also enacted to the United States Clean Air ActClean Air Act Extension of 1970, , , 31 December 1970. and Clean Water Act.Pub.L. 95-217 , 27 December 1977. In 1979, James Lovelock, a British scientist, published Gaia: A new look at life on Earth, which put forth the Gaia hypothesis; it proposes that life on earth can be understood as a single organism. This became an important part of the Deep Green ideology. Throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this Deep Green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists. 21st century and beyond Environmentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as global warming, overpopulation, genetic engineering, and plastic pollution. Research demonstrates a precipitous decline in the US public's interest in 19 different areas of environmental concern. Americans are less likely be actively participating in an environmental movement or organisation and more likely to identify as \\"unsympathetic\\" to an environmental movement than in 2000. This is likely a lingering factor of the Great Recession in 2008. Since 2005, the percentage of Americans agreeing that the environment should be given priority over economic growth has dropped 10 points, in contrast, those feeling that growth should be given priority \\"even if the environment suffers to some extent\\" has risen 12 percent. Nevertheless, a recent National Geographic survey indicated strong desire for commitment across a dozen countries, indicating a majority were in favour of more than half of the Earth's land surface protected.  New forms of ecoactivism  Tree sitting is a form of activism in which the protester sits in a tree in an attempt to stop the removal of a tree or to impede the demolition of an area with the longest and most famous tree-sitter being Julia Butterfly Hill, who spent 738 days in a California Redwood, saving a three-acre tract of forest. Sit-in can be used to encourage social change, such as the Greensboro sit-ins, a series of protests in 1960 to stop racial segregation, but can also be used in ecoactivism, as in the Dakota Access Pipeline Protest. Before the Syrian Civil War, Rojava had been ecologically damaged by monoculture, oil extraction, damming of rivers, deforestation, drought, topsoil loss and general pollution. The DFNS launched a campaign titled 'Make Rojava Green Again' (a parody of Make America Great Again) which is attempting to provide renewable energy to communities (especially solar energy), reforestation, protecting water sources, planting gardens, promoting urban agriculture, creating wildlife reserves, water recycling, beekeeping, expanding public transportation and promoting environmental awareness within their communities. The Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities are firmly environmentalist and have stopped the extraction of oil, uranium, timber and metal from the Lacandon Jungle and stopped the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers in farming.Gobierno Aut√≥nomo I: Cuaderno de texto de primer grado del curso de \\"La Libertad seg√∫n l@s Zapatistas\\", 19. The CIPO-RFM has engaged in sabotage and direct action against wind farms, shrimp farms, eucalyptus plantations and the timber industry. They have also set up corn and coffee worker cooperatives and built schools and hospitals to help the local populations. They have also created a network of autonomous community radio stations to educate people about dangers to the environment and inform the surrounding communities about new industrial projects that would destroy more land. In 2001, the CIPO-RFM defeated the construction of a highway that was part of Plan Puebla Panama. Environmental movement Before flue-gas desulfurization was installed, the air-polluting emissions from this power plant in New Mexico contained excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide. The environmental movement (a term that sometimes includes the conservation and green movements) is a diverse scientific, social, and political movement. Though the movement is represented by a range of organisations, because of the inclusion of environmentalism in the classroom curriculum, the environmental movement has a younger demographic than is common in other social movements (see green seniors). Environmentalism as a movement covers broad areas of institutional oppression, including for example: consumption of ecosystems and natural resources into waste, dumping waste into disadvantaged communities, air pollution, water pollution, weak infrastructure, exposure of organic life to toxins, mono-culture, anti- polythene drive (jhola movement) and various other focuses. Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: environmental science, environmental activism, environmental advocacy, and environmental justice. Free market environmentalism Free market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the free market, property rights, and tort law provide the best tools to preserve the health and sustainability of the environment. It considers environmental stewardship to be natural, as well as the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors through individual and class action. Evangelical environmentalism Evangelical environmentalism is an environmental movement in the United States of America in which some Evangelicals have emphasized biblical mandates concerning humanity's role as steward and subsequent responsibility for the care taking of Creation. While the movement has focused on different environmental issues, it is best known for its focus of addressing climate action from a biblically grounded theological perspective. This movement is controversial among some non-Christian environmentalists due to its rooting in a specific religion. Preservation and conservation Environmental preservation in the United States and other parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation. Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources. Organisations and conferences Ifaty, Madagascar Environmental organisations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private (NGO). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns. Some US environmental organisations, among them the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, specialise in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based National Wildlife Federation, Earth Day, National Cleanup Day, the Nature Conservancy, and The Wilderness Society, and global groups like the World Wide Fund for Nature and Friends of the Earth, disseminate information, participate in public hearings, lobby, stage demonstrations, and may purchase land for preservation. Statewide nonprofit organisations such as the Wyoming Outdoor Council often collaborate with these national organisations and employ similar strategies. Smaller groups, including Wildlife Conservation International, conduct research on endangered species and ecosystems. More radical organisations, such as Greenpeace, Earth First!, and the Earth Liberation Front, have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground Earth Liberation Front engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however. On an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations. Out of this meeting developed UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and the follow-up United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. Other international organisations in support of environmental policies development include the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (as part of NAFTA), the European Environment Agency (EEA), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Most recent deaths are in Brazil, where activists combat logging in the Amazon rainforest. 116 environmental activists were assassinated in 2014, and 185 in 2015. This represents more than two environmentalists assassinated every week in 2014 and three every week in 2015. More than 200 environmental activists were assassinated worldwide between 2016 and early 2018. A 2020 incident saw several rangers murdered in the Congo Rainforest by poaching squads. Occurrences like this are relatively common, and account for a large number of deaths. In popular culture * The U.S. Forest Service created Smokey the Bear in 1944; he appeared in countless posters, radio and television programs, movies, press releases, and other guises to warn about forest fires.Ellen Earnhardt Morrison, Guardian of the Forest: A History of Smokey Bear and the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Program (1995) * The comic strip Mark Trail, by environmentalist Ed Dodd, began in 1946; it still appears weekly in 175 newspapers. * The children's animated show Captain Planet and the Planeteers, created by Ted Turner and Barbara Pyle in 1989 to inform children about environmental issues.

From Saturday, 4 May, to Sunday, 3 November 1974, Spokane hosted Expo 74, the first world's fair to focus on the environment. The theme of Expo 74 was \\"Celebrating Tomorrow's Fresh New Environment.\\" * FernGully: The Last Rainforest is an animated motion picture released in 1992, which focuses exclusively on the environment. The movie is based on a book under the same title by Diana Young. In 1998, a sequel, FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue, was introduced. * Miss Earth is one of the Big Four international beauty pageants. (The other three are Miss Universe, Miss International, and Miss World.) Out of these four beauty pageants, Miss Earth is the only international beauty pageant that promotes \\"environmental awareness.\\" The reigning titleholders dedicate their year to promote specific projects and often address issues concerning the environment and other global issues through school tours, tree planting activities, street campaigns, coastal clean ups, speaking engagements, shopping mall tours, media guesting, environmental fair, storytelling programs, eco-fashion shows, and other environmental activities. The Miss Earth winner is the spokesperson for the Miss Earth Foundation, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other environmental organizations. The Miss Earth Foundation also works with the environmental departments and ministries of participating countries, various private sectors and corporations, as well as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF). * Another area of environmentalism is to use art to raise awareness about misuse of the environment. One example is trashion, using trash to create clothes, jewelry, and other objects for the home. Marina DeBris is one trashion artist, who focuses on ocean and beach trash to design clothes and for fund raising, education. Criticism and alternative views Many environmentalists believe that human interference with 'nature' should be restricted or minimised as a matter of urgency (for the sake of life, or the planet, or just for the benefit of the human species),Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia , 464 pp. whereas environmental skeptics and anti-environmentalists do not believe that there is such a need.Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. \\"Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?.\\" New Global Studies 7.3: 23‚Äì56. One can also regard oneself as an environmentalist and believe that human 'interference' with 'nature' should be increased.Neil Paul Cummins \\"An Evolutionary Perspective on the Relationship Between Humans and Their Surroundings: Geoengineering, the Purpose of Life & the Nature of the Universe\\", Cranmore Publications, 2012. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the shift from emotional environmentalism into the technical management of natural resources and hazards could decrease the touch of humans with nature, leading to less concern with environment preservation. Increasingly, typical conservation rhetoric is being replaced with restoration approaches and larger landscape initiatives that seek to create more holistic impacts.

The eighth tropical storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginny developed on October 16 over the Bahamas, although it was not initially a fully tropical cyclone. As it moved to the North and later northwest, Ginny intensified to hurricane status as it became more tropical. For eight days, it was located within of the United States coastline. After approaching North Carolina, Ginny looped to the southwest and approached within of the Florida coastline. It turned to the North, to the East, and later to the northeast, strengthening late in its duration to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Ginny became an extratropical cyclone shortly after striking Nova Scotia at its peak intensity on October 29\\\\. Although it remained close to the United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Ginny were from a trough that extended from the Bahamas to Bermuda in the middle of October. On October 16, a depression formed near the Turks and Caicos islands after a tropical wave interacted with the trough, although initially it was not tropical in nature due to the widespread presence of cold air. The system initially moved generally northward, attaining gale‚Äìforce winds on October 19 as it turned to the northwest. For several days, Ginny maintained a hybrid-type structure, and although it attained winds of on October 20, it was not a true hurricane. It closely approached the North Carolina coastline, passing 135 mi (220 km) southeast of Cape Lookout before turning abruptly to the northeast. It executed a small loop and began a steady motion to the southeast while located over the Gulf Stream. This motion was due to a large ridge located over New England. On October 21, the hurricane became better organized and began transitioning into a tropical cyclone. By early on October 22, Hurricane Hunters indicated that Ginny completed the transition into a fully tropical cyclone, observing an eye 20 mi (32 km) in diameter. On October 23, Ginny briefly weakened to tropical storm status as it was moving toward Florida, although within 10 hours it regained hurricane intensity. Its motion to the southwest was unusual but not unique, and resembled the tracks of the 1935 Yankee hurricane and Hurricane Able in 1951. On October 24, it turned sharply northeastward off the northeast Florida coast, coming within of Daytona Beach. The hurricane continued paralleling the coast of the Southeastern United States, turning northeast away from Georgia and South Carolina. On October 26, Ginny turned to the east away from the United States, having been located within of the country's coast for eight consecutive days. The next day, the hurricane began a motion to the northeast, accelerating in advance of an approaching trough. It gradually intensified, reaching peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) on October 29\\\\. Later that day, Ginny made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia at its peak strength, making it the strongest tropical cyclone to ever hit Atlantic Canada. Ginny became extratropical shortly thereafter, and its remnants dissipated on October 30 in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Impact precipitation across the United States Early in its duration, the precursor to Ginny dropped high amounts of rainfall. Monci√≥n in the Dominican Republic reported , and Green Turtle Cay in the Bahamas reported . Despite Ginny's proximity to the United States for over a week, a hurricane warning was only issued from Charleston, South Carolina, and Cape Fear, North Carolina, as well as Cape Hatteras. This represented about one-sixth of the entire coastline that was threatened by the storm. In Jacksonville, Florida, Ginny produced winds of . Rainfall in the state peaked at at Saint Augustine. Tides in Daytona Beach were above normal, which caused beach erosion and minor property damage. Further north, minor damage and beach erosion was likewise reported in Georgia. Along the South Carolina coast, Ginny dropped beneficial rainfall, which alleviated the state's worst drought conditions on record. The rainfall peaked at in Isle of Pines. The hurricane approached North Carolina twice. During the second time, residents in low-lying areas and along the coast evacuated. As it passed the area, Ginny produced sustained winds that were estimated at on Cape Fear, with gusts to 100 mph (160 km/h). These were the highest winds related to the hurricane, although they may have been overestimated. In addition, the heaviest rainfall related to the storm occurred near Southport, where of precipitation fell. Tides along the coast were above normal, which caused minor flooding and destroyed one house in Carolina Beach. In Virginia, the hurricane caused minor flooding and minimal beach erosion. During Ginny's first approach through the region, it produced gale-force winds along the Virginia coast, although it did not do so during its second approach. Later, a gale warning was issued for New England due to Ginny's threat, as well as a hurricane watch for Long Island and southern New England. Across the region, the strongest winds on land were along Nantucket, where a gust of was also reported. However, a boat offshore Portland, Maine reported seas and winds of at least . In New York City, the outskirts of the storm dropped of precipitation, and tides were above normal. Rainfall in eastern New England surpassed , peaking at in Machias, Maine. The rainfall was beneficial across the region, ending a 28-day drought. Along Cape Cod and in Maine, high winds from the storm downed several trees, some of which fell onto power lines. About 1,000 homes in Chatham, Massachusetts lost power. In Nantucket, high waves caused additional erosion in an area affected by Hurricane Esther two years prior. Damage was heavier in Maine, where many boats were damaged or broke from their moorings. One person died from a heart attack while trying to rescue his boat. Several small buildings in the state were destroyed, and the post office in Calais, Maine lost its roof. Ginny was the latest hurricane on record to affect Maine. During its passage, Ginny brought an influx of cold air over New England that produced the first snowfall of the season across Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire. In most locations, the snow quickly melted, although higher totals occurred in northern Maine, the highest being on Mount Katahdin. The snow killed a mountain climber and a park ranger. Damage from Ginny in the United States was estimated at $400,000. As the remnants of Ginny moved across Atlantic Canada, they produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 4.53 in (113 mm) in southern New Brunswick. Winds peaked at 99 mph (160 km/h) in Greenwood, Nova Scotia. The winds blew down trees in the Halifax area, and there were power outages reported there and in Antigonish. High waves broke boats from their moorings, causing them to either wash ashore or float out to sea. Ferry service across the region was canceled. In neighboring New Brunswick, the storm caused outages to telephone and electric services. Several injuries were reported, although there were no fatalities. The entirety of Prince Edward Island was also left without power.

Geography San Fele is a picturesque stone village located at the saddle between two mountain peaks, Monte Toretta and Monte Castello, and overlooking the Vitalba Valley. The \\"comune\\" (municipality) of San Fele is part of the Comunit√† montana del Vulture which makes it a gateway to the Vulture section of the province of Potenza in the state of Baslicata, Italy, which is famous for its excellent and economical \\"aglianico\\" wines. San Fele is also the trailhead for hikes to lovely waterfalls. The comune/municipality of San Fele includes the towns of Atella, Bella, Castelgrande, Filiano, Muro Lucano, Rapone and Ruvo del Monte. San Fele also includes the hamlets of Agrifoglio, Armatieri, Cecci, Cerrito, Difesa, Montagna, Pierno, Priore, Masone, Signorella. It is also a short drive from Melfi and Melfi Castle. San Fele is about thirty-five miles east of Salerno, and is about a two hour drive from Naples or four hours from Rome. History Inhabited since ancient times by woodsmen and called Lucania by the ancient Greeks and Romans, the actual city of San Fele originated in 969, with the construction of an octagonal fortified castle on what is now called Monte Castello, commissioned by Otto I of Saxony to repel potential attacks by the Byzantines who ruled Southern Italy at the time. The area was seen as strategically important because the Crocelle Pass, the southern passage through the Apennine Mountains lies in the northeast corner of the Comune (municipality) of San Fele. From ancient times this Pass functioned as a major trade route between Salerno in the West and Bari in the East, both major trading ports. The route was also a major pathway for Crusaders and Pilgrams to the \\"Holy Land\\". San Fele was named by the workers who built the fortress, and were from Venosa, an ancient Roman city also in Basilicata. They dedicated the fortress to their protector-saint, Saint Felix (San Felice), which has been shortened to Fele. In the aftermath of the unification of Italy during the 1840s, much of the local population was displaced, and the area was affected by banditry. Famous brigands included Giovanni Fortunato, known as \\"Coppa\\", Vito Di Gianni, called \\"Totaro\\" and Francesco Fasanella, called \\"Tinna\\", who were part of the infamous Carmine Crocco. A television miniseries about these infamous highway bandits, ', was made in 2012. As a result of this upheaval, and partly due to drought, deforestation and a devastating earthquake, San Fele was part of the large emigration of the late 19th century (to North and South America). A large number emigrated to the United States, including New York City, Buffalo, New York and Newark, New Jersey, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. In addition, after the upheaval of World War II, and particularly in the 1950s and '60s, many San Felese emigrated (to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, and northern Italy). Currently, the population of San Fele is about 3,000 people, down from over 10,000 in the 1870s. The primary industry in San Fele is agriculture, and the area features lovely woodlands and hiking trails, and is known for the fertility of its volcanic soil which produces the excellent aglianico wines for which Basilicata is known, as well as mushrooms, truffles, cheese, game, and handmade pastas. Although much of the area was deforested due to a timber boom during the 19th century and to clear land for farming, part of the Comune of San Fele includes a national park with lush forestland dominated by oak, maple, beech and mountain pine. Because San Fele is located at a higher altitude, this is a restful place to escape the heat of summer and to see pristine nature, including San Fele's small and charming waterfalls or \\"cascade\\".https://www.italybyevents.com/en/events/basilicata/san-fele- waterfalls/ San Fele feast days include: January 20: Feast of the Patron Saint Sebastian 1st Sunday of May: Feast of the Madonna di Pierno 30 July: Feast of San Giustino de Jacobis 15 August: Feast of the Madonna of Pierno 8 September: Feast of the Madonna of Pierno San Fele hosts the Basilicata International Film Festival in August, and the Feast of Madonna di Pierno, which has been celebrated since 1139 AD, also in August. San Fele is also known as the birthplace of San Giustino de Jacobis (on 9 October 1800), whose home has been restored and is now a destination for pilgrims. Many descendants of San Felese diaspora have created San Fele Societies, including the San Felese Society of New Jersey, the San Fele Association of Western New York, and San Felesi in Australia.

He moved on to working in a nightclub, owning a bar in the Amsterdam marketplace, and opening a card club in Antwerp, Belgium. As a hobby, he and his brothers picked up five-card stud and played in their downtime at the market. L√ºske's card skills among the local vendors led them to suggest him to enter a $1,000 buy-in tournament in Prague. As a result of his successful playing, he won over $40,000 and turned professional.

Originally issued bi-weekly, it has been a weekly since April 1899. It is considered to be the oldest continuously-published college weekly in the U.S., which means that it has been in publication every academic year that Bowdoin has been in session since it began publishing weekly. (Other college weeklies stopped printing during certain war years.) In the beginning, the Orient was laid out in a smaller magazine format and included literary material such as poems and fiction alongside its news. In 1897, the literary society formed its own publication, The Quill, and the Orient has since primarily focused on reporting news. In 1921, the Orient abandoned the magazine format and moved to a larger broadsheet layout to keep up with the trend of the times. Since then, it has variously moved between broadsheet and tabloid sizes and has seen major format updates every decade or two. In 1912, The Bowdoin Publishing Company was established as the formal publisher of the Orient, and remained independent of the college for many years, while using college facilities and working with faculty-member advisers. The Bowdoin Publishing Company was a legal, non-profit corporation in the state of Maine for many years, at least from 1968 to 1989, though it was most likely an independent corporation since its inception. In 2002, the college forced the Orient to close the Bowdoin Publishing Company's off-campus checking account, which represented the final step in the company's dissolution. The Orient building has its own archives, with issues dating back to 1873, but it is missing several periods of time. The Hawthorne-Longfellow Library at Bowdoin College has a nearly complete archive of past Orient issues, both in print and on microform. Virtually all print issues are available from 1871 to the present in the library's George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections & Archives. Bound copies from 1871 to 1921 can be found in the periodicals section of the library. The Orient is available on microfilm for issues from 1921 to the present.Bowdoin Library ‚Äî Special Collections & Archives ‚Äî Bowdoin OrientBowdoin Library ‚Äî Main Library ‚Äî Bowdoin Orient Archives are also available online through the Internet Archive.Internet Archive ‚Äî Bowdoin Orient NotesExternal links *The Bowdoin Orient web site *@bowdoinorient on Twitter *Orient Express blog *Bowdoin College Category:Student newspapers published in Maine Category:Bowdoin College Category:Publications established in 1871 Category:1871 establishments in Maine ","title":"The Bowdoin Orient"},{"id":"1866055","text":"Mount Logan can refer to: *Mount Logan, the highest point in Canada at *Mount Logan (Alaska) in Alaska *Mount Logan (Arizona) in Arizona *Mount Logan (Colorado) in Colorado *Mount Logan (Montana) in Montana *Mount Logan (Ohio) in Ohio *Logan Peak in Utah *Mount Logan (Washington) in Washington *Mount Logan (Wyoming) in Wyoming *Mount Logan Wilderness in Arizona See also *Logan Peak *Logan Mountain ","title":"Mount Logan (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1866075","title":"Ann Morgan Guilbert"},{"id":"1866083","text":"Fujiwara no Kanezane by Kikuchi Y≈çsai , also known as , is the founder of the Kuj≈ç family (at the encouragement of Minamoto no Yoritomo), although some sources cite Fujiwara no Morosuke (908-960) as its founder.

(2005). \\"Fujiwara no Nakahira\\" in ; Brinkley, Frank et al. (1915). Considered a learned scholar and well-versed in the customs of the court, he supported the court's government as udaijin during the reign of Emperor Murakami. Morosuke's eldest daughter Fujiwara no Anshi, empress consort to Emperor Murakami, gave birth to two princes who later became Emperor Reizei and Emperor En'y≈´, putting Morosuke's lineage in an advantageous position as the maternal relatives of the Emperor. Life Morosuke was born the second son of Fujiwara no Tadahira, who controlled the government for many years as sekkan (regent) and daij≈ç-daijin. Around 930 he had an affair with a daughter of Emperor Daigo, Princess Kinshi, and was later permitted to marry her. This was the first time a non-imperial Japanese retainer married an imperial princess ‚Äî in previous cases where retainers married the daughters of emperors, those daughters had first been divested of their imperial status. From 931 to 947 he was steadily promoted, passing through the position of sangi and attaining the post of provisional ch≈´nagon. When Taira no Masakado launched his rebellion, Fujiwara no Tadabumi was appointed as , but the rebellion was put down before he could join battle. The court debated Tadabumi's honors, and Morosuke's older brother Saneyori argued that as Tadabumi had not done anything, he should not be granted any prize. Morosuke argued that as Tadabumi had accepted his orders and set out from the capital, he should still be rewarded. Saneyori stuck to his own position, but public opinion favored Morosuke. After this Morosuke was promoted to dainagon, made a , and bestowed the . In 947, Emperor Suzaku abdicated, and Emperor Murakami ascended to the throne. As Saneyori was promoted to sadaijin, Morosuke filled his old position as udaijin and was granted the .Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). ; see \\"Fousiwara-no Moto souki\\", pre-Hepburn romanization Promotion naturally favored the eldest son and family heir, but Morosuke was considered excellent enough to cause problems for his older brother in spite of this: Morosuke held more real power than even Saneyori. Morosuke had married his eldest daughter Anshi to Murakami while he was still the crown prince. With his enthronement she became a court lady and assisted the emperor often, and when she bore him the future Emperor Reizei Anshi was made ch≈´g≈´. As the maternal grandfather of the crown prince, Morosuke and his cohorts were able to lead the court by Murakami's side for about ten years. After the death of his wife Princess Kinshi, Morosuke married Princess Gashi, and when she died Princess Yasuko, all of whom were daughters of Emperor Daigo, thus further deepening his ties with the imperial line. Because he had affairs with and then married three different imperial princesses, Morosuke may have been the model for a character in the Utsubo Monogatari, the ultimate lecher, Fujiwara no Kanemasa. In 960 Morosuke was laid out by illness, and according to the customs of the day attempted to cut his hair and take the tonsure, but Emperor Murakami sent a messenger to dissuade him. Even so, his sickness worsened, and on May 29 he cut off his hair, only to die two days later on May 31, 960, at the age of 53. Morosuke never held the position of sekkan in his life, but the successive reigns of his grandchildren Emperor Reizei and Emperor En'y≈´ after Murakami's death put his family in an outstanding position as the emperor's maternal relatives. His eldest son Koretada briefly held power as sekkan, and his other sons Kanemichi, Kaneie, Tamemitsu, and Kinsue also all attained the position of daij≈ç-daijin. In Morosuke's children's generation, his descendants were the legitimate line of the Fujiwara regent family.  Personality and works  Morosuke and his older brother Saneyori, both educated by Fujiwara no Tadahira, each formed their own school of the practices and traditions of the court. Morosuke formed the , and Saneyori the , which were passed down to their respective descendants. Morosuke recorded the practices of his school in a book called the . He was friends with , who was also versed in the ways of the court, and to whom he married his third and fifth daughters. The talented Takaakira flourished with Morosuke's support. Morosuke was also an excellent poet, leaving behind a collection of his works simply called . In 956 he held a party in his garden, and the ≈åkagami contains an anecdote about his visit to Ki no Tsurayuki to request that the latter write a poem for him. Thirty-six of Morosuke's poems are included in the Gosen Wakash≈´. His personal diary and the dying instructions he left for his descendants, , are also preserved.

She portrayed recurring characters on several situation comedies, beginning with Bewitched in 1966 in \\"Maid To Order\\", in which Ghostley played an inept maid named Naomi, who was hired by Darrin Stephens (played by Dick York) to assist his wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) during her pregnancy. Towards the end of the 1965‚Äì66 season, actress-comedian Alice Pearce, who was featured as nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz on Bewitched, died. The producers of the series immediately offered the role of Gladys to Ghostley, who refused it. As a result, in the fall of 1966, character actress Sandra Gould assumed the role of Gladys. In September 1969, after the death of actress Marion Lorne, who played Aunt Clara, Ghostley joined Bewitched as a semiregular in the role of Esmeralda, a shy witch who served as a maid and babysitter to the Stephens' household. Ghostley's character of Esmeralda was created to replace Aunt Clara's role as a bumbler of magic. (Coincidentally, Ghostley and Lorne shared a brief scene together in the 1967 film The Graduate, a few months prior to Lorne's death and before Ghostley was cast in Bewitched.) Ghostley's Esmeralda appeared in 15 episodes of Bewitched between 1969 and 1972. During her two years on Bewitched, Ghostley also joined the cast of Mayberry R.F.D., playing Cousin Alice after Frances Bavier's character, Aunt Bee, was written out of the series. She appeared in 14 episodes. On February 22, 1969, she appeared as Aggie on The Ghost & Mrs Muir (starring Edward Mulhare and Hope Lange). The episode was entitled \\"Make Me A Match\\". The captain and Mrs. Muir matched her with Claymore Gregg (Charles Nelson Reilly). On March 6, 1970, she appeared on another episode of The Ghost & Mrs Muir, \\"Curious Cousin\\". She played nosey Cousin Harriet. She interferes with Mrs Muir's private life. To divert her excessive attention, Claymore, posing as Captain Gregg, comes to court her. After eight years, Bewitched was cancelled by ABC in the spring of 1972. Later that year in September, Ghostley was hired as a semiregular for the ABC-TV variety series, The Julie Andrews Hour; in addition to participating in songs and sketches, Andrews and Ghostley were featured in a recurring segment as roommates sharing a small apartment. The Julie Andrews Hour was cancelled by ABC in the spring of 1973 after 24 episodes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ghostley appeared in episodes of situation comedies such as Hogan's Heroes (alternating with Kathleen Freeman playing Gertrude Linkmaier, General Burkhalter's sister), Good Times, Maude, One Day at a Time, The Odd Couple, and What's Happening!!. Between 1986 and 1993, Ghostley portrayed Bernice Clifton, the slightly off-kilter, eccentric friend of Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker's mother, Perky, on Designing Women. She later played Irna Wallingsford in six episodes of Evening Shade. She also had a recurring role of Ida Mae Brindle in the sitcom Small Wonder, which ran from 1985 to 1989. Among many other guest roles, she appeared in a flashback episode as the crazed mother-in-law of Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur) on The Golden Girls. She made a one-time appearance as Great-Grandma in Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Ghostley also made a few guest appearances on the daytime drama Passions in 2000, playing the ghost of Matilda Matthews. Film Among her roles in motion pictures, Ghostley appeared in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), playing Stephanie Crawford, the neighborhood gossip. She appeared in the film version of Grease as shop teacher Mrs. Murdock. In 1985, she had a supporting role in the Nancy Allen comedy Not for Publication. Alice played Grandmama in the direct-to-video movie Addams Family Reunion. Awards Ghostley received a Tony nomination in the late 1960s for different roles she played in the Broadway comedy The Beauty Part. She also received a Tony award for Best Featured Actress for her role in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window. In 1992, she earned an Emmy nomination for her role in Designing Women. Personal life Ghostley was married to Felice Orlandi, an Italian-American actor, from 1953 until his death in 2003. Ghostley died at her home in Studio City, California, on September 21, 2007, after a long battle with colon cancer and a series of strokes. On August 20, 2009, her ashes were taken to Oak Hill Cemetery in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, and buried with her sister Gladys (died June 21, 2009). The sisters are interred next to their parents and near Alice's husband, Felice Orlandi.

The school's current enrollment is approximately 215 students as of 2018. The school's old building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2019, for the state of Illinois, Niche ranked Roycemore School as the fourth most diverse private high school, the ninth-best private high school, and the fifth-best private K‚Äì12 school. The school currently has a six-to-one student-to-teacher ratio. Roycemore also offers the NU Option program, in which its high school students can take courses at Northwestern University and earn credit, making it the only Independent school to have such a partnership with Northwestern. History Roycemore School was founded in 1915 as a co-ed school, but boys could only go up to 3rd grade. It became fully co-ed in 1962. Its original location was in north Evanston, Illinois, near Northwestern University. The former Roycemore School building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form identifies the two architecture firms that were involved in the design and realization of Roycemore‚Äôs original school buildings. It says that architect Lawrence Buck designed the buildings, with the firm of Talmadge & Watson involved as associated architects. Thomas Eddy Tallmadge is identified as the lead representative for his firm.*National Register of Historic Places nomination form In discussing the style and importance of the buildings in Section 8 of the form, the NRHP nomination says; ‚ÄúRoycemore School is of considerable architectural significance because it is one of only two examples known to exist in the Midwest of an educational building designed according to the principles evolved by such famous early modern architects in England as Charles Voysey and M. H. Baillie Scott. As such it eschews the accoutrements of the historic styles and emphasizes instead the stern virtues of simplicity of form and honesty of expression that gave sustenance to the English progressive movement from Pugin through Eastlake to Morris and Voysey....‚Äù*National Register of Historic Places nomination form Relocation As its property lease with Northwestern University for the lot at Lincoln St. and Orrington Ave. was due to end in 2014, in early 2000 the school began looking for another Evanston location that would allow room to continue a trend of enrollment growth that had occurred over the previous 10 years, with updated technology and to accommodate a larger, regulation-sized gymnasium. Roycemore began classes at 1200 Davis Street in Evanston on January 6, 2012. The 3-acre lot, adjacent to Evanston's Alexander Park, was the location of a 55,000-square-foot building that was once the headquarters of the General Board of Pension Funds for the United Methodist Church. Roycemore completely renovated the building and added a nearly 8,000-square-foot gymnasium. Athletics and Extracurriculars The school has no-cut athletic teams starting in the fifth grade, including basketball, soccer, cross country and volleyball. Roycemore's mascot is the Griffin and the school colors are blue and gold. Each year, Roycemore School holds its annual Palio, which is the school's oldest tradition. Palio was modeled after the pageant that proceeds the Palio di Siena in Italy. Students from grades 1‚Äì12 display the progress they have made in physical education classes during the year. The emphasis is on rhythmics, dance, gymnastics, and sports skills. Roycemore's Palio has a colorful procession, where each new Kindergarten class is handed down a banner with the coat of arms from the graduating Senior class that the younger students will carry until graduation in twelfth grade. Another longstanding tradition at Roycemore is their tumbling program. Starting in third grade, students can be found participating in mounts, lifting other students, or flying through the air as part of their performance. The program culminates in three annual all-school performances, including Palio, for fellow students, parents and alumni.

Underwood had created Combato in 1910, a \\"non-boxing or wrestling\\" unarmed combat system which he taught in Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto, Ontario, and Defendo grew out of this system. History Combato had its beginning in the Liverpool theatres with jujutsu demonstrations by travelling Japanese wrestlers, Yukio Tani and Taro Miyake. As a boy, Underwood idolized these experts, and rapidly established himself as a prodigy. The name Defendo was created on August 15, 1945, in New York City by Underwood's daughter, Pat, when Underwood was a guest in the United States training U.S. Army Rangers and for the American FBI for use in unarmed combat. Underwood was frequently requested by American and Canadian Law Enforcement Agencies to teach his Combato system during World War II, but as the war had ended he refused on the basis that Combato was too aggressive. Underwood was asked to modify the system to remove its lethal applications and instead focus on the Law Enforcement applications of self-defence, compliance and control tactics. He realized that he could not call this system Combato, so his daughter Pat Underwood proposed that he call the system \\"Defendo\\". A new name From 1945 to 1950 Underwood taught his developing self-defence system in Canada and the USA under the new name. In 1950 he published under copyright \\"Defendo, Police System of Self-Defence\\",Bill Underwood, \\"Police System of Self-Protection\\", Toronto, copyright 1950 which became one of the first open-hand police tactics manuals used by police departments in Canada and the United States.

While the main focus of the collection is trolley cars (trams), it also includes rapid transit trains, Interurban cars, trolley buses, and motor buses. The Seashore Trolley Museum is owned and operated by the New England Electric Railway Historical Society (NEERHS).Young, Andrew D. (1997). Veteran & Vintage Transit, pp. 43‚Äì48. St. Louis: Archway Publishing. . Of the museum's collection of more than 250 vehicles, ten trolley and railroad cars that historically operated in Maine were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, as Maine Trolley Cars.  History  The Morrison Hill Station at the Seashore Trolley Museum Theodore F. Santarelli de Brasch was one of the founders of the museum, which was initially operated as the Seashore Electric Railway. He graduated from Harvard University and led the museum until he died in 1987. The events that led to the formation of the museum started in 1939, when a group of railfans learned that the Biddeford and Saco Railroad was purchasing motor buses to replace its fleet of trolley cars. More and more trolley companies were doing this as the technology of buses had developed to the point that they were reliable and economical. The railfans decided to find out if they could purchase a trolley to preserve it for posterity. The railroad was willing to sell them a car (#31, a 12 bench open trolley) for $150. However, it would have to be moved to another location due to local ordinances that prohibited retired trolleys from being used as houses, even though this was not the railfans' intention. A plot of land, part of a farm, was rented on Log Cabin Road in Kennebunkport, adjacent to the right-of-way for the Atlantic Shore Line Railway's Kennebunk-Biddeford route, and the trolley was moved to it. At about the same time, another group of railfans purchased a trolley from the Manchester and Nashua Street Railway. The two groups merged, and the Nashua trolley was brought to the Log Cabin Road site. The group of founders formally incorporated in 1941 as the New England Electric Railway Historical Society. World War II caused the museum to be put on hold, as many members served in the armed forces for the duration. This also brought about a temporary revival of trolley services in many cities, as rubber and gasoline were rationed for the war effort. A 1918-built car of the Eastern Mass. Street Railway After the war, conversion of trolley lines to buses resumed, and created a period of rapid growth for the museum's collection. In the 1950s, a diesel-powered electric generator was used to allow the cars to move under their own power. Car 31 was moved into a small building so that it could be repaired and restored. The first major expansion occurred in late 1955 and early 1956, when the Society purchased land near the Biddeford city line along U.S. Route 1. In the summer of 1956, the Seashore Electric Railway began passenger operations on weekends over its of track. In 1980, ten of the museum's trolley and railroad cars were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (as \\"Maine Trolley Cars\\"). These include trolley #31 and other vehicles either built or operated in Maine. Two cars of the Aroostook Valley Railroad, and two built by the York Utilities Company of Sanford are included in this collection. As of 2010, the museum had over 260 vehicles. While most are from New England and other areas of the United States, trolleys from Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, Hungary, England, Scotland, Italy, and several other countries are also in the collection. One of the motor buses the museum owns is Biddeford and Saco #31, the bus that replaced trolley #31 in 1939. The bus was donated to the museum by the bus company. The Seashore Trolley Museum continues to acquire new vehicles for the collection. The museum is open from 10 am to 5 pm. From Memorial Day to Columbus Day, it is open daily, and from the first weekend of May through Memorial Day, and from Columbus Day to the last weekend in October, it is open on weekends.  Exhibits and features  Cars 434 (Dallas, TX), 1700 (Sydney, Australia), 62 (Philadelphia, PA), and 838 (New Haven, CT) The main building at the museum, the Visitor Center, includes a ticket booth, a museum store with an extensive collection of rare and out-of-print books and DVDs as well as many toys and souvenirs, a snack bar, and an exhibit room with trolley and transit-related artifacts. The trolleys that have been restored to operating condition are shown on display in three car barns. A restoration shop with an elevated observation gallery shows visitors how the vehicles are maintained and restored. Additional storage barns and tracks, which are not accessible to the general public, contain vehicles that are awaiting restoration. A few of the restored trolleys are operating on the demonstration line at one time. Restored trolleys are used on the museum's demonstration railway, which follows the route of the Atlantic Shore Line, a trolley line that ran on the current museum property and connected Kennebunkport to York Beach. Since the line was abandoned in the 1920s, museum volunteers have rebuilt from scratch. Seashore owns the right of way to Biddeford, which is about from the Visitor Center. A demonstration route leads to Talbot Park (which is a loop to turn around the trolleys) and back to the Visitor Center. The collection of trolley buses includes vehicles from all over the country, and the world, of which about twenty are in operating condition. Restoration on as many as six to seven cars is underway at all times. Discussions are under way to extend the trolley bus line and to rehabilitate the existing line.Trolleybus Magazine No. 295 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2011), p. 11. National Trolleybus Association (UK). ISSN 0266-7452. The museum has many themed events throughout the operating season (May‚ÄìOctober) including dog day, sunset ice cream rides, community appreciation day, veterans' appreciation day, antique auto day, pumpkin patch trolley, transit day, children's story time, and special prelude rides on the first two weekends in December. The exhibit room may be rented for parties, gatherings, meetings or family reunions. In 2014 the museum held its first ever speakeasy event with costumes, special cocktails and music/movies of the era, and planned to do this again in 2015. The museum is seeking to raise funds to build a new car house (car barn) and library, as well as for restoration of current buildings, cars, grounds and visitor center. The museum is also proposing to eventually extend the trolley demonstration line to Route 1 in Biddeford.

He was the elder son of Emperor Manuel I and his third wife, Irene Syrikaina, a Trapezuntine noblewoman.So William Miller identifies her. Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 27 He succeeded his half-brother Andronikos in 1266 and ruled for 14 years.  Reign  The details of the internal affairs of his reign are sparse. Beyond the length of his reign, all Michael Panaretos relates explicitly about George is the cryptic statement that he \\"was treacherously betrayed by his officials on the mountain of Taurezion and taken captive in June [of 1280]\\".Panretos, Chronicle, 4; translated in A. Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos, Ruler of Trebizond (1266‚Äì1280),\\" Byzantinische Zeitschrift 66 (1973), p. 333 Although three different Armenian chronicles state he was killed by Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhan, along with the atabeg of Lori,Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", pp. 343-345 he was very much alive in 1284 when he returned to Trebizond and attempted to recover his throne during the reign of his brother John II, when Panaretos states he was known as \\"the Wanderer\\".Panretos, Chronicle, 5; translated in Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", p. 333 Michel Kur≈°anskis has pointed out that his father's embassy in 1253 to King Louis IX of France, who was then at Sidon, seeking to marry a daughter of his house was the act of a widower. Kur≈°anskis then convincingly argues that Manuel's marriage to Irene Syrikaina occurred after that year, which means George was no older‚Äîand likely several years younger‚Äîthan 13 at the time of his coronation. So for the first several years of his reign he relied on a regent to govern the Empire.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'usurpation de Th√©odora Grande Comn√®ne\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 33 (1975), pp. 199, 206f The details of the foreign affairs of his reign are relatively more abundant. One factor was that his rival for the claim to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, Michael VIII Palaiologos, had agreed to unify the Orthodox and Catholic Churches, and an agreement was signed at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274; as a result George was increasingly seen as the champion of the anti-Unionist faction. George found himself directly threatened by Mu‚Äòin al-Din Suleyman who controlled Sinope to the west and the Georgian state of Samtzkhe-Meschla to the east; Imereti was also a potential threat, and its ruler, David the Clever had married one of Michael's daughters in 1267. Michael had also married another daughter to Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhan. Consequently, George was forced into negotiations with Michael Palaiologos' enemies. As early as 1266-7 Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, wrote to George; George's response is not known. The protonotary Ogerius reported to Pope Nicholas III that George was upsetting the Union of Churches that Michael Palaiologos promoted. \\"It was not so much that Charles of Anjou had a quixotically loyal ally in Trebizond,\\" writes Anthony Bryer, \\"as that while Michael was forcing his subjects into the union, George was pushed by anti-Unionist refugees from Constantinople into posing as champion of Orthodoxy and into seeking to replace the 'heretical' Michael as emperor in Constantinople.\\"Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", p. 342 The Annals of Bishop Stephen state that George had an unnamed daughter, who married a Georgian nobleman.Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", p. 343 Another possible daughter (or sister) married King Demetre II of Georgia.Genealogical table in Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", p. 343. This is based on material taken solely from M. F. Brosset, Historie de la Georgie, depuis l'Antiquite jusqu'au XIXe siecle, I (St. Petersburg, 1849-50), pp. 579-607  The betrayal at Taurezion  The cryptic note that George was betrayed on the mountain of Taurezion has baffled scholars about both the location and the exact event. No other text directly mentions \\"the mountain of Taurezion\\". There have been several suggested explanations, starting with the Taurus Mountains, one of several locations to the south of Trebizond, and a Taroutza in eastern Anatolia. Bryer discusses these possibilities before pointing out the weaknesses in their identification, and arguing that by \\"Taurezion\\" Panaretos meant Tabriz, which was known in a form at the time similar to \\"Taurezion\\": spellings include the Armenian \\"T'awrez\\" or \\"Davrez\\"; Marco Polo called it \\"Tauris\\", and a Syrian bishop of \\"Taurezium\\" is mentioned in 1277.Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", pp. 334-340 As for how George was betrayed, there are at least two differing suggestions. On the one hand, George Finlay and William Miller have interpreted this as meaning that he was captured in battle,Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 341; Miller, Trebizond, p. 27 which has been followed by other historians.For example, David Winfield, \\"A Note on the South-Eastern Borders of the Empire of Trebizond in the Thirteenth Century\\", Anatolian Studies, 12 (1962), p. 170 On the other hand, Anthony Bryer has published an article in the Byzantinische Zeitschrift arguing that this passage should be interpreted as saying that George was betrayed to Agaba Khan by his archontes on a mountain near Tabriz, where Agaba was residing in summer of 1280. Scholars, such as Michel Kur≈°anskis, have accepted Bryer's interpretation.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'usurpation\\", p. 187 A third researcher, Ahmet Zehiroglu, has suggested George was trapped as a result of the Byzantine conspiracy and taken prisoner along with his mother by Abaqa Khan, on Dersim Mountains and in the summer of 1280.Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; \\"Trabzon Imparatorlugu 2\\" (Trabzon, 2016) () ; p.77 Bryer further points out that there are signs George never fully assumed the title of Emperor (basileus), where there is evidence that his father Manuel had before him, and his brother John after him. No silver coinage was struck in his name‚Äîalthough a surprisingly large amount (over 200 dies) was struck in his father's; Bryer suggests some of it was issued by George in his father's name. Only one of his copper coin issues does he bear the epithet of \\"Grand Komnenos\\", while in another he is described as \\"Despot\\" (despotes), a title subsidiary to Emperor. Further, he is the only ruler of Trebizond that Panaretos, in his chronicle, fails to call \\"Grand Komnenos\\", and does not refer to his mother Irene Syrikaina as \\"despoina\\". \\"It is possible that Abaga refused to recognize him as Grand Komnenos,\\" Bryer writes, \\"hence the subsidiary title of Despot on one of his coin types, his failure to coin silver aspers and Panaretos' reticence in according him any title.\\"Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", pp. 347f Having made his argument, Bryer then speculates on George's last documented years. Bryer points out that it was not an impostor who appeared in Trebizond in 1284, for \\"it is unlikely that John II would have failed to recognize his half-brother\\". Instead Bryer suggests that for various reasons Abaga spared George and imprisoned him, and on Abaga's death on 1 April 1282, George was released. Then \\"he went to his son-in-law Demetrius II of Georgia and from Georgia launched an attack on Trebizond in 1284\\", only to be rejected by the same people who betrayed him four years earlier.Bryer, \\"The Fate of George Komnenos\\", p. 350 References * The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, 1991.

She also used it to restore significant buildings that had been damaged in the previous years of warring. Many of these restorations were originally credited to her brother Iemitsu, or her husband, but have recently been properly credited to her.

The Gardens are bounded by the Yarra River to the north, Princes and Swan street bridges, with Queen Victoria Gardens and Kings Domain across Alexandra Avenue to the south. The gardens are part of the Domain parklands which stretch to the Royal Botanic Gardens and were first laid out in 1901, under the direction of Carlo Catani, Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department. The Alexandra Gardens were named in honor of Alexandra of Denmark, in the year her reign as Queen Consort of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress consort of India began. The Alexandra Gardens are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register due to their historical and archaeological significance. Yarra River & Melbourne City Skyline View at Alexandra Gardens  Domain Parklands  Alexandra Gardens are part of a larger group of parklands directly south-east of the city, between St. Kilda Road and the Yarra River known as the Domain Parklands, which includes; * The Royal Botanic Gardens * Kings Domain * Alexandra Gardens * Queen Victoria Gardens  History  From the time of European settlement of Melbourne in 1835, the area of the gardens was used for timber cutting, cattle grazing and as a brickmakers' field. Regular flooding occurred until a new channel for the Yarra River was dug from 1896 to 1900 to straighten and widen the river. The spoil was used to fill the swampy lagoons and brickmakers pits and raise the height of the river bank where Alexandra Gardens now stands. Landscaping occurred immediately, and the gardens were planned and laid out for the visit of the Duke of York in May 1901.  Cycling and skating  Aerial perspective of the Star-shaped garden bed in Alexandra Gardens Pedestrian and cycle access to the gardens is via steps or a ramp from Princes Bridge, or along the promenade from Southbank under Princes Bridge. Vehicular access is provided by Boathouse Drive from Alexandra Avenue. Next to Princes Bridge bicycles are available for hire to explore the Capital City Trail along the river. Also the prominent, The Around the Bay in a Day cycling event has its finish line at the Gardens. A skate park opened in 2001 in the gardens, with a caf√© and first aid station, close to some distinctive Canary Island Palms which were planted in 1911.  Rowing  Alongside the Yarra River numerous rowing club boathouses nestle in the gardens, including the Mercantile Rowing Club. The Olympic champions, the Oarsome Foursome, were known to train along the Yarra river. The annual Henley-on-Yarra regatta was held from 1904, every spring just before Melbourne Cup day. For a day and a night, Melburnians flocked to the Yarra to watch this sporting event, with attendances peaking at 300,000 in 1925. After World War II, the event declined in significance, however the annual Australian Henley Rowing Regatta still occurs as an amateur event in December, with recent attempts to increase its popularity. Past the boathouses are lawns with electric barbecues, which are popular spots for picnics and office parties around Christmas time. As well as lawns fronting the Yarra river, the gardens contain a star-shaped garden bed representing the Federation of Australia; many mature trees including elms and an avenue of planes and oak trees along Boathouse Drive; ornamental flower beds.

It introduced the pipe-smoking, well-meaning but clumsy character of Monsieur Hulot, who appears in Tati's subsequent films, including Mon Oncle (1958), Playtime (1967), and Trafic (1971). The film gained an international reputation for its creator when released in 1953. The film was very successful as it had a total of 5,071,920 admissions in France. Plot Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot follows the generally harmless misadventures of a lovable, gauche Frenchman, Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati himself), as he joins the \\"newly emerging holiday-taking classes\\" for a summer vacation at a modest seaside resort. The film affectionately lampoons several hidebound elements of French political and economic classes, from chubby capitalists and self- important Marxist intellectuals to petty proprietors and drab dilettantes, most of whom find it nearly impossible to free themselves, even temporarily, from their rigid social roles in order to relax and enjoy life. The film also gently mocks the confidence of postwar western society in the optimistic belief in capitalist production, and the value of complex technology over simple pleasures, themes that would resurface in his later films. Cast * Jacques Tati as Monsieur Hulot * Nathalie Pascaud as Martine * Micheline Rolla as The Aunt * Valentine Camax as Englishwoman * Louis Perrault as Fred * Andr√© Dubois as The Major * Lucien Fr√©gis as Hotel Proprietor * Raymond Carl as Waiter * Ren√© Lacourt as Strolling Man * Marguerite G√©rard as Strolling Woman * Claude Schillio as Photographer Style The principal setting for the film, H√¥tel de la Plage at Saint-Marc-sur-Mer (Saint-Nazaire), France, in 2009 is now run by Best Western Hotels For the most part, in Les Vacances, spoken dialogue is limited to the role of background sounds. Combined with frequent long shots of scenes with multiple characters, Tati believed that the results would tightly focus audience attention on the comical nature of humanity when interacting as a group, as well as his own meticulously choreographed visual gags. However, the film is by no means a 'silent' comedy, as it uses natural and man-made sounds not only for comic effect but also for character development. The film was made in both French and English language versions. While Tati had experimented with color film in Jour de f√™te, Les Vacances is black and white. The jazz score, mostly variations on the theme \\"Quel temps fait-il √† Paris\\", was written by Alain Romans. Les Vacances was shot in the town of Saint-Marc-sur-Mer, which lies on the edge of the industrial port of Saint-Nazaire, in the D√©partement of Loire-Atlantique. Tati had fallen in love with the beguiling coastline while staying in nearby Port Charlotte with his friends, M. and Mme Lemoine, before the war and resolved to return one day to make a film there. Tati and his crew turned up in the summer of 1951, \\"took over the town and then presented it to the world as the quintessence of French middle-class life as it rediscovered its rituals in the aftermath of the Second World War.\\" The Independent, 20 July 2003 \\"Neither too big nor too small, [St Marc fitted the bill] - a sheltered inlet, with a graceful curve of sand, it boasted a hotel on the beach on which the main action could be centred. Beach huts, windbreaks, fishing boats and outcrops of rock helped to complete a picture which was all the more idyllic for being so unspectacular.\\" A bronze statue of Monsieur Hulot was later erected and overlooks the beach where the film was made. Critical response On its release in the United States, Bosley Crowther's review said that the film contained \\"much the same visual satire that we used to get in the 'silent' days from the pictures of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and such as those.\\" He said the film \\"exploded with merriment\\" and that Tati \\"is a long-legged, slightly pop-eyed gent whose talent for caricaturing the manners of human beings is robust and intense.... There is really no story to the picture.... The dialogue... is at a minimum, and it is used just to satirize the silly and pointless things that summer people say. Sounds of all sorts become firecrackers, tossed in for comical point.\\"Crowther, Bosley (1954), \\"The Screen in Review: French Satirical Film Opens at Fine Arts,\\" The New York Times, 17 June 1954, p. 36. Tati biographer David Bellos has described the film as \\"Sublime,\\" and said that, \\"It was through this film that I first fell in love with France. I think that is true of a lot of people.\\" The journalist Simon O'Hagan, writing on the occasion of the film's 50th anniversary in 2003, wrote that the film, \\"might contain the greatest collection of sight gags ever committed to celluloid, but it is the context in which they are placed and the atmosphere of the film that lift it into another realm. The central character is an unforgettable amalgam of bafflement at the modern world, eagerness to please and just the right amount of eccentricity - i.e. not too much - his every effort to fit in during his seaside holiday merely succeeds in creating chaos out of orderliness. Puncturing the veneer of the comfortably off at play is by no means the least of Tati's concerns. But, [there is] an elegiac quality [too], the sense that what Tati finds funny he also cherishes.\\" Beauty and the Beach, Simon O'Hagan, The Independent on Sunday, Arts Section, p.6, 20 July 2003 The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.

It is also known as '; its provisional designation was '.C.C. Porco, et al., IAUC 8524: S/2005 S 1 May 6, 2005 (discovery)Martinez, C.; and Dyches, P.; Cassini-Huygens: Cassini Finds New Saturn Moon That Makes Waves May 10, 2005 Daphnis is about 8 kilometres in diameter, and orbits the planet in the Keeler Gap within the A ring.  Naming  The moon was named in 2006 after Daphnis, a shepherd, pipes player, and pastoral poet in Greek mythology;IAUC 8730: Saturn XXXV (Daphnis) (naming the moon) he was descendant of the Titans, after whom the largest moons of Saturn are named. Both Daphnis and Pan, the only other known shepherd moon to orbit within Saturn's main rings, are named for mythological figures associated with shepherds.  Discovery  Before it was photographed, the existence of a moon in Daphnis's position had already been inferred from gravitational ripples observed on the outer edge of the Keeler gap. Daphnis was resolved into a disc for the first time in this 2005 Cassini probe image. The gravitational ripples on the edges of the rings, which had earlier hinted at the moon's presence, are clearly visible.NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute, \\"Wavemaker Moon\\" (2005-05-10) The discovery of Daphnis was announced by the Cassini Imaging Science Team on May 6, 2005.IAUC 8524: S/2005 S 1 The discovery images were taken by the Cassini probe over 16 min on May 1, 2005, from a time-lapse sequence of 0.180 second narrow-angle-camera exposures of the outer edge of the A ring. The moon was subsequently found in 32 low-phase images taken of the F ring on April 13, 2005 (spanning 18 min) and again in two high- resolution (3.54 km/pixel) low-phase images taken on May 2, 2005, when its 7 km disk was resolved.  Orbit  The inclination and eccentricity of Daphnis's orbit are very small, but distinguishable from zero. Both, particularly the inclination, are significantly greater than those of Pan (the larger moonlet which forms the Encke Gap). Daphnis's eccentricity causes its distance from Saturn to vary by ~9 km, and its inclination causes it to move up and down by ~17 km. The Keeler Gap, within which Daphnis orbits, is about 42 km wide.  Effect on Saturn's rings  The waves that Daphnis induces nearby in the A ring have vertical relief (due to its orbital inclination) and cast shadows when Saturn is close to its equinox. Daphnis orbits within the Keeler gap in Saturn's rings. As it orbits, it creates gravitational ripples on the edges of the gap as ring particles are attracted toward the moon and then fall back down toward the ring. The waves made by the moon in the inner edge of the gap precede it in orbit, while those on the outer edge lag behind it, due to the differences in relative orbital speed. In a photograph taken on January 18, 2017, a tendril of ring particles can be seen to extend toward the moon; according to JPL, \\"this may have resulted from a moment when Daphnis drew a packet of material out of the ring, and now that packet is spreading itself out.\\"  Physical characteristics  On January 18, 2017, Daphnis was photographed from a sufficiently close distance to reveal its shape. The moon was discovered to be an irregularly-shaped object with a mostly smooth surface, a few craters, and an equatorial ridge.

Located on 4.8 hectares (12 acres) opposite the Victorian Arts Centre and National Gallery of Victoria, bounded by St Kilda Road, Alexandra Avenue and Linlithgow Avenue. Queen Victoria's reign started in 1837, two years after the initial European settlement of Melbourne, and upon her death in 1901 it was thought appropriate to declare an enduring monument to her reign. A memorial statue was commissioned from sculptor James White showing the Queen in ceremonial gowns casting her regal gaze across ornamental lakes, sweeping lawns and rose gardens to the Melbourne Arts Centre Spire and the city skyscrapers. Queen Victoria Gardens are part of a larger group of parklands directly south-east of the city, between St. Kilda Road and the Yarra River known as the Domain Parklands, which includes; *The Royal Botanic Gardens * Kings Domain * Alexandra Gardens *Queen Victoria Gardens Features A huge floral clock is positioned opposite the National Gallery of Victoria, containing over 7,000 flowering plants which are changed twice yearly. The clock was donated in 1966 to the City of Melbourne by a group of Swiss watchmakers. Behind the clock stands a bronze equestrian statue, a memorial to Queen Victoria's successor, King Edward VII. The statue, by Melbourne born sculptor Bertram Mackennal, was unveiled on 21 July 1920. Queen Victoria Memorial A granite and marble memorial, commissioned by public subscription from sculptor James White and positioned at the highest point of the gardens, commemorates five aspects of Queen Victoria. The memorial is of white Carrara marble, Harcourt granite and NSW Caloola marble,http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114058691 and was unveiled by Sir John Madden on Empire Day, 24 May 1907. Originally home to native grasses, she-oaks, wattles, paperbarks, and river red gums, the area now consists of ornamental lakes, sweeping lawns, flowerbeds of annuals, and mature European and Australian trees and shrubs in a landscaped garden. As well as the monuments to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII, the gardens are notable for their array of sculptures. These include an exploratory play sculpture for children, The Genie, by Tom Bass in 1973. The Pathfinder was manufactured in 1974 by John Robinson and details a bronze Olympic Hammer thrower in action. The Phoenix was sculptored from cast bronze and welded copper sheet by Baroness Yrsa Von Heistner in 1973 to commemorate the 40th International Eucharistic Congress. The Bronze Water Children is an installation by John Robinson, made in 1973, which shows playing children at the top of a stream. The Water Nymph is a kneeling bronze figure sculptored in 1925 by Paul Montford, modelled on Eileen Lillian Prescott. A classic rotunda was built in 1913 and named after Janet, Lady Clarke, a philanthropist who worked for the welfare of women in Melbourne.

With some 17,000 inhabitants, is bounded by the towns of Rotondella, Scanzano Jonico and Tursi. Situated on the coast, its population swells in the summertime due to an influx of tourists who come to enjoy the Lido di Policoro.  History  The construction of the town was started in 680 BC by Greeks colonists from Colophon, but the town was destroyed in the 6th century BC by the Achaean colonies in coalition with Metaponto, Crotone, and Sibari. In 432 BCE, the town was rebuilt in the same place as before and was called Heraclea (also Heracleia or Herakleia). In very little time, it became richer and more famous than the nearby town Siris. In 280 BCE, the Battle of Heraclea happened there during the war between Taranto and Rome. The Tables of Heraclea date back to this period and they are now located in the Archeology Museum of Naples. These ancient bronze tablets contain texts in Greek and Latin that discuss public and constitutional rules and laws of the town, one such being \\"Lex Iulia Municipalis\\". During the Middle Ages, the entire area depopulated and Heraclea lost its prestige, becoming a little village on a small hill. It was called Policoro, Œ†ŒøŒªœçœáœâœÅŒøŒΩ meaning \\"large place\\" in Greek. The population was sheltered from nearby villages, which were threatened, by numerous invasions and raids. Eventually, the village became a baronial feud and the town developed around the baronial castle, used as a residence from 1000 CE for hunting because of the vast forests owned by local noble families, such as the Berlingieri. Only after 1950, thanks to the work to reclaim the land which had become marshy and unhealthy over the centuries and also to the agrarian reform that split and redistributed the land to guarantee a fast development and resettlement, Policoro received municipal autonomy. This change attracted families to move to Policoro from all parts of the region.  Geography and weather  It is on the Ionian coast, 70 km far from Taranto and Matera. Policoro has a hot Mediterranean climate and enjoys mild winters with moderate rainfall. Summers are warm to hot and also dry and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July has only two or three days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above 20 ¬∞C and frequently reaches 30 ¬∞C+. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months (July and August) is around 37 ¬∞C. During winter, days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. Frost is unusual and snowfall is extremely rare that they are remembered by the townspeople as special events. The last noticeable snowfall occurred in early January 2017. The average minimum temperature in January is around 7 ¬∞C. Spring starts mild and rainy in late March and becomes increasingly warmer and sunnier towards June. Culture Events in the ton include *Blues in Town: organized annually by the cultural association La Mela di Odessa, the summer festival, which was founded in 2004, has had performances by artists such as Neffa, Giuliano Palma, Rocco Papaleo, James Senese, Paolo Belli, and Inibizioni Recidive. *Policoro in Swing: organized annually by the cultural association Vintage Routes, the festival has been held every year at the end of August since 2013. It's an original swing dance camp where music, dancing, sailing, and vacationing combine into a week of fun. *Balloon‚ÄîChildren's Cartoon and Literature Festival, a summer cultural event that was born in 2012 and has hosted esteemed Italian cartoonists such as Silver (Lupo Alberto), Corrado Mastantuono (Dylan Dog, Tex, and various Disney characters), Giuseppe Palumbo, and Clod. *Youth Creativity Festival. Organized annually by the Young Democrats of Policoro, the festival was created in 2009 to showcase young artists. Sport Policoro had a football team, Policoro 2000 Calcio, until the 2009 Championships. During the 2009‚Äì2010 season, Policoro had two teams, A.S.D. Policoro 2000 and A.S.D. Borussia Pleiade. Since the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the two football teams combined into one team, A.S.D Policoro Heraclea. The colors of the team were light blue, white, and red, but then they returned to the original colors of white and light blue. Now, the team is called Real Metapontino and they play in Serie D. In the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the team Avis Borussia Policoro were promoted to Serie B and now they play in Serie A2. In 2016, Policoro created its first boys‚Äô basketball team, A.S.D.

Early life Ann Matthews Martin grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. Her mother, Edith Martin, was a pre-school teacher and her father, Henry Martin, is a cartoonist for The New Yorker and other publications. Her mother's ancestry can be traced back to the pilgrims who traveled on the Mayflower in 1620. She has a younger sister, Jane. Martin developed an interest in writing from an early age. Before she was old enough to write, she would dictate stories to her mother to write down for her. Some of her favorite authors at that time were Lewis Carroll, P. L. Travers, Hugh Lofting, Astrid Lindgren, and Roald Dahl. Martin loved creative writing in elementary school and discovered her passion for writing in second grade. She began writing short stories, and her fourth-grade teacher wrote on her student folder that she would make a wonderful writer because she spent so much of her free time writing in notebooks. Her favorite subjects in middle school and high school were English and French, and her least favorite was math. As a teen, Martin loved working with children and decided to become a teacher. She wanted to help children with disabilities, so she worked during the summer at the Eden Institute, a school for autistic children in her hometown. After graduating from Princeton High School in 1973, Martin attended Smith College from 1973‚Äì1977.Arntzenius, Linda. \\"Ann M. Martin Comes Home to Princeton; Library Discussion, Book-Signing Tonight\\", Town Topics (newspaper), May 2, 2007. Accessed December 10, 2018. \\"After attending Princeton High School, Ms. Martin graduated from Smith College and then trained as a teacher.\\" She studied early-childhood education and child psychology. Her senior thesis was on the use of children's literature in the classroom. She lived in Gardiner House and wrote for Smith College newspaper, The Sophian. Describing her Smith education, Martin said ‚Äúit was an environment of strong, independent women, both the students and the professors.‚Äù Her time at Smith influenced her identity as a feminist and inspired her to portray female characters who were like the women she knew in her own life. Career After graduating from Smith College, Martin taught in a split fourth and fifth-grade classroom at Plumfield School in Noroton, Connecticut. Her students, ages 8‚Äì13, struggled with learning disabilities including dyslexia and autism. Martin has said that her work with special needs children influenced her writing. After teaching for a year, Martin decided to pursue publishing. She worked her way up from an editorial assistant to a senior editor, and she worked for several well-known children's book publishers, including Pocket Books and Scholastic. She is now a full-time writer. In 1983, Martin published her first book, Bummer Summer, which earned the Children's Choice Award in 1985. She began writing The Baby-Sitters Club series in 1985 while working for Scholastic as a children's book editor. After Martin wrote the first 35 novels in The Baby-Sitters Club series, Scholastic hired ghostwriters to continue the series. She now concentrates on writing single novels, many of which are set in the 1960s. One of those novels, A Corner of the Universe, won a Newbery Honor in 2003. In 2010, Martin published a prequel to The Baby-Sitters Club series titled The Summer Before. Martin finds the ideas for her books from many different sources; some are based on personal experiences, while others are based on childhood memories and feelings. Many are about contemporary problems and struggles. All of her characters, including the members of The Baby-Sitters Club, are fictional, but many of her characters are based on real people. Sometimes she names her characters after people she knows, and other times she simply chooses names that she likes. In 1990, Martin and her colleagues founded \\"The Lisa Libraries\\" to honor and memorialize their friend Lisa Novak. This non-profit organization distributes new books to children and establishes libraries in under-served areas. In the same year, Martin also founded the Ann M. Martin Foundation, which provides financial support for art, education, and literacy programs in addition to programs for abused and stray animals. Martin served as a producer for the 2020 Netflix adaptation of The Baby-Sitters Club. Personal life Martin currently maintains a fairly quiet public profile. After living in New York City for many years, Martin moved to the Hudson Valley in upstate New York, where she enjoys nature and fostering kittens. Martin posts semi-regular updates and snapshots of her life on her Facebook page. She stays busy with author appearances and adaptations of her works such as the Babysitters' Club graphic novels and network series. Martin was previously in a relationship with Laura Godwin, with whom she wrote the four Doll People books; she disclosed that Godwin was her partner in 2016.

The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833.Chrimes Administrative History pp. 62‚Äì63 They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they are some of the earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English. They were the records of the yearly audits performed by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224. Composition The Pipe rolls are named after the \\"pipe\\" shape formed by the rolled up parchments on which the records were originally written. There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they \\"piped\\" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or pipe of wine. They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe. The Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually conducted at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury.Warren Governance pp. 73‚Äì74 Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered.Richardson and Sayles Governance pp. 216‚Äì217 Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in instalments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt.Warren Governance pp. 76‚Äì77 If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 198 Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 262 The earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129‚Äì30, and the continuous series begins in 1155‚Äì56,Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms p. 219 and continued for almost seven hundred years.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 112‚Äì113 Combined with the Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066‚Äì1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s.Chibnall Anglo-Norman England p. 126 The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England,Clanchy Memory to Written Record p. 136 although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear.Clanchy Memory to Written Record p. 141 A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154‚Äì1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189‚Äì1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France.Mason \\"Administration and Government\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 139Mason \\"Administration and Government\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 150 It is believed that the Norman rolls were started about the same time as the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 220‚Äì221 An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.Frame Political Development p. 87 The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details the workings of the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells.Chrimes Administrative History p. 60 FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner workings of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used.Clanchy From Memory to Written Record p. 136 The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.Clanchy From Memory to Written Record p. 151 The main source of income recorded on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 164 Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded.Loyn (ed.) Middle Ages p. 266 The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 163 The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo- Saxon times,Warren Governance p. 68 although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld.Warren Governance p. 146 By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls.Warren Governance p. 111Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms p. 23 Scutage payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.Hollister \\"Significance of Scutage Rates\\" English Historical Review p. 578Coredon Dictionary p. 252 Although they recorded all income that came through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, as well as more occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies.Mortimer Angevin England p. 42 Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 164Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms pp. 237‚Äì238 A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law,Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 170 which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings pp. 239‚Äì240 However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls. Expenditures were also subject to documentation in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses,Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 133 wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons,Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings pp. 171‚Äì174 hunting expenses, payments to acquire a governmental office,Huscroft Ruling England p. 159 payments to mercenaries,Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 254 and the costs of bags and casks to transport silver pennies about the kingdom.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 373 Information about other subjects besides revenues also is contained in the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons.Heiser \\"Castles, Constables and Politics\\" Albion p. 20 footnote 8 The Pipe rolls also allow the identification of the custodians of royal lands and castles.Heiser \\"Castles, Constables and Politics\\" Albion p. 22 footnote 22 The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.Heiser \\"Castles, Constables and Politics\\" Albion p. 32 Certain areas did not report their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These included the palatinates of Durham and Chester.Alexander \\"New Evidence\\" English Historical Review p. 719 The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, but it was not a palatinate.Alexander \\"New Evidence\\" English Historical Review p. 724 and footnote 2 Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll.Barratt \\"English Revenue of Richard I\\" English Historical Review p. 636 In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll. History The National Archives, where the Pipe rolls are now held Although the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years.Chrimes Administrative History pp. 30‚Äì31 An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the Cotton Library at the British Museum.Hagger \\"Pipe Roll for 25 Henry I\\" English Historical Review Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign, but others feel that they were introduced by King William I (reigned 1066‚Äì1087). The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian Pauline Stafford argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of Cnut (reigned 1016‚Äì1035), √Üthelred II (reigned 978‚Äì1016), and Edgar the Peaceable (reigned 959‚Äì975).Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 149 There is a reference to the king's \\"rolls\\" in a writ from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of Westminster of ten shillings, but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later cartulary, and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a solid source for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.Clanchy From Memory to Written Record pp. 137‚Äì138 After the one surviving roll from Henry I's reign, no further Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from the reign of his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135‚Äì1154). But by the second year of King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls.Richardson and Sayles Governance p. 257 footnote 5Yoshitake \\"Exchequer in the Reign of Stephen\\" English Historical Review pp. 950‚Äì959 Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199‚Äì1216).Mortimer Angevin England pp. 66‚Äì68 The surviving Pipe roll from 1130 records an income of ¬£24,500.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 159 This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals ¬£68,850.Huscroft Ruling England p. 102 The income that they record in the early years of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about ¬£10,000 to ¬£15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to ¬£20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about ¬£30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only ¬£8,000 in the early years, rising to ¬£16,500 by 1225.Mortimer Angevin England p. 51 Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.Richardson and Sayles Governance p. 260 By the time of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of information in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system was settled on whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded in a set of receipt rolls and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls.Chrimes Administrative History pp. 73‚Äì74 A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate Estreat rolls, and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls.Chrimes Administrative History p. 119 In 1284 the Statutes of Rhuddlan were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls.Chrimes Administrative History p. 148 At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a \\"d\\" and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.Prestwich Edward I pp. 242‚Äì243 Yet more extraneous details were removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323,Chrimes Administrative History p. 181 along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer.Prestwich Plantagenet England p. 59 Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts.Buck \\"Reform of the Exchequer\\" English Historical Review p. 246 Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls.Graves Bibliography of English History p. 473 New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records.Prestwich Plantagenet England p. 208 The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls. In 1462, the exchequer was told to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as these would be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.Wolfee \\"Management of English Royal Estates\\" English Historical Review p. 2 The Pipe rolls series ended in 1834 when the office that was in charge of their creation, the Pipe Office, was abolished.\\"Pipe rolls entry \\" Websters Online Dictionary Creation They were created by taking the shire, or other governmental districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about wide. The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe. They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the Patent Rolls were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving the name of the county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.Ramsay \\"Origin of the Name Pipe Roll\\" English Historical Review pp. 329‚Äì220 Sometimes they are referred to, in Latin, as magnus rotulus pipae.Chrimes Administrative History p. 50 Several sources for the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may have been from Sicily.Clanchy From Memory to Written Record p. 140 The rolls were written in Latin until 1733, except for a short time around 1650.National Archives Research Guides: Early Pipe Rolls, 1130‚Äìc. 1300 During the reign of Henry II, a duplicate copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the Chancellor, and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created at the same time as the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 261 The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or other material. Influence on other records The example of the royal exchequer's records eventually influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls are those of the Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a continuous series from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 201 They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.Clanchy Memory to Written Record pp. 92‚Äì93 Studies by historians A number of historians have studied the surviving Pipe rolls, using them as the basis for study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings pp. 175‚Äì176 Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research.Barratt \\"English Revenue of Richard I\\" English Historical Review pp. 835‚Äì856Barratt \\"Revenue of King John\\" English Historical Review pp. 835‚Äì855 Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 88‚Äì89 Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 191Richardson and Sayles Governance pp. 176‚Äì177 Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.Barratt \\"Revenue of King John\\" English Historical Review pp. 836‚Äì837 The lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites.Mason \\"Administration and Government\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World pp. 148‚Äì149 Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as on the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign.Mason \\"Administration and Government\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 157 The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.Mason \\"Administration and Government\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 162 The Pipe rolls from the 13th century onwards are less important for historical study because there are other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 330‚Äì331 However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.Hales \\"London Residences of Shakespeare\\" Athenaeum pp. 401-402 Publication 21 Henry II (1174‚Äì5), as published by the Pipe Roll Society in 1897 using record type. The earliest Pipe rolls were published by the Record Commission in 1833 (the isolated roll of 1130) and the Public Record Office in 1844 (the rolls for 1155‚Äì58). The Commission's edition of the 1130 roll has now been superseded by a new edition (with English translation) published by the Pipe Roll Society in 2012.Green Great Roll of the Pipe In 1883 the Pipe Roll Society (a text publication society) was founded by the Public Record Office, on the initiative of Walford Dakin Selby and his colleague James Greenstreet, to establish a systematic publishing programme for the Pipe rolls. It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224.Pipe Roll Society \\"Pipe Roll Society Publications\\"Royal Historical Society \\"Pipe Roll Society Publications\\" Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the Yale University Press.Graves Bibliography of English History, p. 474. Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in \\"record type\\", designed to produce a near-facsimile of the original manuscript, including its scribal abbreviations. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since have been published in normal type with abbreviations extended.Pipe Roll Society Great Roll of the Pipe pp. vii-viii The Pipe Roll Society has also published numerous related texts, including the Chancellor's Roll for 1196 and the Norman Pipe Rolls of Henry II.

He was born in Somoto, Madriz. Son of Carlos Mej√≠a Fajardo and Mar√≠a Elsa Godoy, his brother Luis Enrique Mej√≠a Godoy, three years younger than he is, is also an acclaimed and much-loved musician. Carlos and Luis Enrique were pivotal in the New Song Movement in Central America beginning in the 1970s. They were both recently honored with Nicaragua's highest cultural distinction, the Order of Rub√©n Dar√≠o.  Biography  Carlos started his career as 'Corporito' on the radio station 'Radio Corporacion', where he would daily compose songs that would rain ridicule and scorn on all politicians and political parties. He would do it with that biting sense of humor that so few artists are able to master. Many of his songs, performed with his band los de Palacag√ºina, became associated with the Sandinista movement as songs of the workers and revolutionaries. He even composed a Mass for the working class, the Misa Campesina Nicarag√ºense. Many of his songs during the late 1970s gave instructions on how to use, assemble, and disassemble the rifles people were capturing from dictator Somoza's National Guard during street battles. One of his biggest achievements of his career as a songwriter came in 1977, when the song \\"Quincho Barrilete\\" (Quincho, the boy of the little barrel), composed by himself and performed by Eduardo Gonzalez won the sixth edition of the OTI Festival. A victory which is still remembered by many Nicaraguans. In 1980, Carlos Mej√≠a Godoy y los de Palancag√ºina were internally selected by Televicentro Nicaragua to represent their country in the OTI Festival in 1980 with their song \\"La chavalita de Espa√±a\\" (The little girl from Spain). This song marked the return of Nicaragua to the event after two years of absence because of the turbulent Nicaraguan Revolution. Their competing song, which although was one of the favourites, ended in a respectable but disappointing tenth place with 15 points. He was the vice-presidential running mate of Edmundo Jarqu√≠n of the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) in the November 2006 presidential election. They came in fourth place. Mej√≠a Godoy is the father of the United States Army deserter and author Camilo Mej√≠a, as well as the musicians Carlos Luis 'La Bujilla' Mej√≠a and Augusto 'El Negro' Mej√≠a from the Grammy-nominated Nicaraguan ensemble La Cuneta Son Mach√≠n.

History Tourism Court at Orchard Spring Lane, the headquarters of Singapore Tourism Board Singapore Visitors Centre along Orchard Road, providing tourism information for tourists in Singapore. The board was first established on 1 January 1964 and was called the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (Abbreviation: STPB). In that year, there were 91,000 visitors. The primary task of STPB was to coordinate the efforts of hotels, airlines and travel agents to develop the fledgling tourism industry of the country. Later, STPB began to initiate new marketing ideas to promote Singapore's image abroad. The board created the Merlion, a symbol based on a Singapore mythical legend, that became an icon of the Singapore destination. The board has also been providing travel agent licensing and tourist guide training. STPB actively promoted the development of infrastructure, including the building of hotels and tourist attractions such as the Jurong Bird Park and Sentosa which is now a popular resort island for both tourists and local visitors. The board also markets the city as a convention venue and organises events to attract visitors. In the 1980s, several historic and culturally significant areas such as Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam were earmarked for preservation. These places express Singapore's cultural diversity and became popular tourist destinations. The Singapore River underwent a major cleanup program and the areas along the river were developed for restaurants and other tourist amenities. The board was renamed as Singapore Tourism Board in 1997. Past Chairmen * Mr Chew Choon Seng Past CEOs * Lim Neo Chian * Mr Lionel Yeo Mission Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park and its surrounds The board now oversees all aspects of tourism, including resource allocation and long-term strategic planning. It establishes offices around the globe to actively market the Singapore destination. In the short term, the Singapore government has allocated S$905 million to STB for tourism developments until 2017. A third of this amount will be used to assist the industry to build manpower competencies through education and skills-upgrading initiatives, particularly in key areas such as conference management. Growth Singapore tourism industry has grown rapidly since STPB was set up. In 2004, there were 8 million visitors. On 11 January 2005, Minister for Trade and Industry unveiled the Singapore Tourism Board‚Äôs (STB) targets to doubling visitor arrivals to 17 million by 2015. In March 2010, the STB projected a 20-30% increase in visitor arrivals for the year. 2010 would see the much awaited opening of both the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa.Channel News Asia- STB forecasts 20-30% jump in visitor arrivals this year This coincided with other key events such as the FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. These offerings were expected to enhance Singapore‚Äôs status as a dynamic global city and increase visitor arrivals. The changes in Singapore's landscape would also continue beyond 2010.

It was well known for giving away posters in the centre of the paper (initially black and white, but colour from late 1971) and later for covering heavy metal (especially the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM)) and Oi! music in its late 1970s‚Äìearly 1980s heyday. History It was produced by Spotlight Publications (part of Morgan Grampian), which was set up by Jack Hutton and Peter Wilkinson, who left Melody Maker to start their own company. Sounds was their first project, a weekly paper devoted to progressive rock and described by Hutton, to those he was attempting to recruit from his former publication, as \\"a leftwing Melody Maker\\". Sounds was intended to be a weekly rival to titles such as Melody Maker and New Musical Express (NME). During the golden period of publication - late 70s - ad production was carried out by Len D River. Sounds was one of the first music papers to cover punk. Mick Middles covered the Manchester music scene for Sounds from 1978 to 1982 writing about many of the up and coming bands of the time from Buzzcocks and Slaughter & The Dogs to The Fall (band) and Joy Division. John Robb (musician) joined in 1987 and came up with the term \\"Britpop\\". The paper's editors realised the importance of its regional audience and had freelancers across the UK contributing gig reviews and articles about up-and-coming local bands. Keith Cameron wrote about Nirvana after Robb carried out the first ever interview with them. Frontman Kurt Cobain was often seen wearing a Sounds shirt. One of the trinity of British music weeklies, along with NME and Melody Maker, Sounds folded in 1991 after the parent company, United Newspapers, sold all their music titles to EMAP Metro. Morgan-Grampian had been acquired by United Business Media ‚Äì then known as United News and Media ‚Äì in 1987, first as part of the United Advertising Publications (UAP) division and later as part of the then CMP Information portfolio. A legacy of Sounds was the creation of the heavy metal/rock magazine Kerrang!, which was originally issued as a supplement before being spun off as a separate publication.

It was a special award given to all Nazi Party members who had, as of 9 November 1933, registered numbers from 1 to 100,000 and unbroken Party membership. The recipient's party number was inscribed on the reverse of the badge. Only 20,487 men and 1,795 women were awarded the badge on these terms. The Golden Party Badge was also awarded at the discretion of Hitler to certain members of the party who merited special treatment and, on 30 January each year, to persons who had shown outstanding service to the Nazi Party or State. These badges had the initials 'A.H.' and the date of the award on the reverse. Examples of such awards include to General Wilhelm Keitel for his direction of the 1938 occupation of the Sudetenland, and to Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz in 1943 for war services. The Golden Party Badge was the basic Nazi Party Badge with the addition of a gold wreath completely encircling the badge. The badge was awarded in two sizes: 30.5 mm for wear on service uniforms and 24 mm for wear on a suit jacket. In the event of the death of the recipient, the badge would be kept by the family. However, due to the numbered certificate, no one else was allowed to wear the badge. Adolf Hitler's own Golden Party Badge had the number '1'. However, his actual Party number was 555, as the numbers started at 500 to make the party's membership at the time, appear larger. He awarded his Golden Party Badge to Magda Goebbels in late April 1945 and proclaimed her as the \\"First Mother of the Reich\\". The '1' badge was discovered by the Red Army after the capture of Berlin, and later stolen from a museum display in Russia in 2005. The guards thought that a cat had set off the alarms and this allowed the burglar to escape with the badge.Times online, 19 November 2005. In the 1930s, Rudolf Hess had explored the possibility of making the Golden Nazi Party Badge the first degree of a multi-degree award of the German Order. In Hess' proposal, the Golden Nazi Party Badge would have been the lowest degree, followed by a 2nd class medal, 1st class cross, and then a Knight's Cross neck order. Hess's degrees were never instituted, but the later German Order retained the Golden Nazi Party Badge as its centerpiece. The public wear of all Nazi Party badges, including the Golden Party Badge, was banned in 1945.

It was the first in a series of anthology films from Amicus and was followed by Torture Garden (1967), The House That Dripped Blood (1970), Asylum (1972), Tales from the Crypt (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973) and From Beyond the Grave (1974). Plot (including cast list) Five men enter a train carriage in London bound for (the fictional town of) Bradley, and are joined by a sixth, the mysterious Doctor Schreck (Peter Cushing) whose name, he mentions, is German for \\"terror\\". During the journey, the doctor opens his pack of Tarot cards (which he calls his \\"House of Horrors\\") and proceeds to reveal the destinies of each of the travellers. This provides the framework to tell five horror stories. * Peter Cushing - Dr. Schreck Werewolf Architect Jim Dawson (Neil McCallum) returns to his old family home on a Scottish isle to make renovations for the new owner, Mrs. Biddulph (Ursula Howells). Biddulph explains she bought the secluded house to help her recover from the death of her husband. Dawson finds the coffin of Count Cosmo Valdemar behind a fake wall in the cellar. Valdemar, the original owner of the house, was killed in a conflict with the Dawson family centuries ago. Local legend states that Valdemar would reclaim his former home and take revenge on the current owner. Dawson discovers that Valdemar is rising at night as a werewolf, and has already killed a housemaid (Katy Wild). Believing Mrs. Biddulph to be in danger, he makes silver bullets out of an ancestral cross that protected the house against Valdemar's spirit. When the wolf appears, Dawson is baffled that the bullets don't kill it. Mrs. Biddulph explains that she has replaced the silver bullets with ordinary ones. She reveals to Dawson that the truth of the legend is that Valdemar will take revenge on the last descendant of the Dawson clan, and placing a Dawson corpse in Valdemar's coffin will restore Valdemar to life in human form. It was all a trap: Biddulph is Valdemar's wife, who has returned from the grave after 200 years. * Neil McCallum - Jim Dawson * Ursula Howells - Deirdre Biddulph * Peter Madden - Caleb * Katy Wild - Valda * Edward Underdown - Tod Creeping Vine Bill Rogers (Alan Freeman) and his wife and daughter (Ann Bell and Sarah Nicholls) return from their holiday to discover a fast-growing vine in the garden. When the plant seems to respond violently to attempts to cut it down, Rogers goes to the Ministry of Defence, where he gets advice from a couple of scientists (played by Bernard Lee and Jeremy Kemp). The plant becomes intelligent, and harbours homicidal tendencies towards any threats to its existence. * Ann Bell - Ann Rogers * Bernard Lee - Hopkins * Alan Freeman - Bill Rogers * Jeremy Kemp - Jerry Drake * Sarah Nicholls - Carol Rogers Voodoo Biff Bailey (Roy Castle) is a jazz musician who accepts a gig in the West Indies, and foolishly steals a tune from a local voodoo ceremony. When he tries to use the tune as a melody in a jazz composition back in London, there are dire consequences. Running from an unknown force, Bailey stumbles against a wall where there is a garish poster for \\"Dr Terror's House of Horrors\\". This story is probably based on the short story \\"Papa Benjamin\\" by Cornell Woolrich, which was also adapted by the television series Thriller and the radio series Suspense. The quintet of British jazz saxophonist Tubby Hayes appears as Bailey's backing band. * Roy Castle - Biff Bailey * Kenny Lynch - Sammy Coin * Harold Lang - Roy Shine * Christopher Carlos - Vrim * Thomas Baptiste - Dambala Disembodied Hand Pompous art critic Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee) seems more concerned with his own devastating wit than art itself. Painter Eric Landor (Michael Gough) bears the brunt of one of Marsh's tirades, but gets even by humiliating the critic publicly. When Landor takes it too far, Marsh responds by driving over him with his car, causing Landor to lose one of his hands. Unable to paint any more, Landor commits suicide. Marsh is then tormented by the disembodied hand, which seems immune to fire as well as attempts to contain it, leading to Marsh's eventual blindness in a car accident of his own. * Christopher Lee - Franklyn Marsh * Michael Gough - Eric Landor * Isla Blair - Pretty girl * Judy Cornwell - Nurse * Hedger Wallace - Surgeon Vampire Dr Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) returns to his home in the United States with his new French bride, Nicolle (Jennifer Jayne). Soon there is evidence that a vampire is on the loose, and Carroll seeks the aid of his colleague, Dr Blake (Max Adrian). They find that Nicolle is the vampire. Following Blake's advice, Carroll kills Nicolle. When the police come to arrest Carroll for his wife's murder, Blake denies giving any such advice. As the police take Carroll away, Blake says to himself that the city isn't big enough for two doctors or two vampires, and he turns into a bat. * Max Adrian - Dr. Blake * Jennifer Jayne - Nicolle Carroll * Donald Sutherland - Dr. Bob Carroll * Al Mulock - Detective Epilogue The frame story ends with a twist. Dr. Schreck informs the men that the only way they can avoid these horrible destinies is by dying first. When the train stops, the men find out that they are already dead, having perished in a train crash while their fortunes were being told. Schreck is revealed to be Death himself. Production Dr. Terror's House of Horrors was a conscious attempt by Milton Subotsky to repeat the success of Dead of Night (1945). Subotsky considered that movie to be \\"the greatest horror film ever,\\"Brosnan, John. The Horror People. London, 1976. and used it as a blueprint for Dr. Terror and the rest of Amicus's portmanteau films. The script began as a stillborn television series in 1948 during the time when Dead of Night was a recent release. Subotsky wrote the original stories in 1948 when he was employed as a scriptwriter for NBC's Lights Out series. Filming began on Dr. Terror's House of Horrors at Shepperton Studios on 25 May 1964 with a budget of ¬£105,000 and was completed on 3 July 1964. It was released on 5 February 1965. Donald Sutherland was paid ¬£1,000 ($10,153.31 in 2018 dollars) for his performance. It was filmed using the cinematic process known as Techniscope. Critical reception In a contemporary review, Variety noted \\"a usefully chilly package deal which will offer audiences several mild shudders and quite a lot of amusement. Even though occasional giggles set in, the cast, headed by experienced horror practitioners such as Peter Cushing, Michael Gough, Christopher Lee and Max Adrian, sensibly play it straight.\\" Chris Coffel from Bloody Disgusting called the film \\"an Underrated Horror Anthology\\", and commended the film's cinematography.

Frank Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 23. He becomes a more prominent character in Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, which purports to show the lives of some of Baum's characters from another perspective, and more prominent still in the 2003 Broadway musical Wicked which is based on Maguire's novel. History In Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Boq is a rich Munchkin man who lives in the eastern quadrant called Munchkin Country in the Land of Oz. He gladly provides shelter for Dorothy and her dog Toto on their first night in Oz while on their journey to the Emerald City. Though the novel initially depicts Dorothy meeting only three local Munchkin men when she first encounters the Good Witch of the North upon her unexpected arrival, she does come across a lavish banquet at Boq's Munchkin mansion while on the Yellow Brick Road (consisting of his family, his closest friends and five fiddlers) celebrating the demise of the Wicked Witch of the East. They welcome Dorothy as a guest of honor and thank her for freeing them. Boq is very impressed when he sees Dorothy is wearing the charmed Silver Shoes the Wicked Witch had owned and even waits upon her himself, offering her fruit, nuts, cakes, pies and several other scrumptious treats. He is also the one who informs her that the favorite color of the Munchkin people is blue and that only good witches and sorceresses wear white. With the combination of white and faded blue checks in Dorothy's gingham dress, this implies to them that she is a friendly witch, even though Dorothy knows she is just an ordinary little girl from Kansas. After the celebration, Boq gives Dorothy and Toto a comfortable bed to sleep in. In the morning when Dorothy eats a hearty breakfast, Boq admits to Dorothy at the dining table that he has never been to the Emerald City and does not know exactly how far away that it is, for he believes that no one should ever go there unless one has business with the great and powerful Oz. Other works In Dorothy of Oz, Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and China Doll Princess arrive in the Munchkin Village where they meet up with Boq. When Dorothy tells him that Toto is a prisoner of the Jester at Princess Gaylette's castle, Boq tells Dorothy that it has been raining for several months and that much of Munchkin County is underwater enough to put the Yellow Brick Road into a state of disrepair. Boq tells the group that the secret of the Yellow Brick Road involved the Wizard of Oz having the Good Witch of the North use magical ingredients to make it where it had the color of sunlight even when it rains for a short time. Following a break in the storm, Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and Boq headed to where Dorothy's house landed when she first arrived in the Land of Oz. While there, the group encounters the Queen of the Field Mice who mentioned that the constant rains have forced the Field Mice out of their burrows and even detect the presence of the Wicked Witch of the East's ghost. After a part of the Yellow Brick Road is put back in place and the Wicked Witch of the East's ghost disappears, the Munchkins and the Field Mice celebrate the spell being broken as Dorothy's group boards Tugg and heads down the Munchkin River once more. Boq in the novel Wicked In Maguire's novel, Boq is a childhood friend of Elphaba and a classmate of hers at Shiz University, where he assists her in doing research for Doctor Dillamond. He is the point-of-view character for several chapters in a section of the book. Boq becomes friends with Crope, Tibbett, and Avaric, although he appears to be jealous of Avaric's good looks, charm, and money. His infatuation with Galinda, which never comes to more than a brief kiss, gradually lifts and they become friends. Boq eventually marries Milla, one of Galinda's classmates at Crage Hall. The two wed and return to Boq's Munchkinland farm. Elphaba encounters Boq not long after Nessarose's funeral, as she inquires after Dorothy, and again after her assault on Madame Morrible. Boq in the musical Wicked In the musical, Boq is the love interest of Elphaba's younger sister, Nessarose (who would later become the Wicked Witch of the East). However, the feeling is not mutual; Boq only became involved with Nessarose in hopes of impressing Galinda, on whom he truly has his heart set. Unfortunately, Galinda has so little regard for him that she cannot remember his name (calling him Biq). When Nessarose eventually becomes the governor of Munchkinland, she uses her power to enslave Boq as her personal servant. When Boq confesses his love for Glinda, Nessarose becomes extremely angry with him. At that point, she casts a spell on him from Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmrie, but mispronounces it. This causes Boq's heart to shrink until it is completely gone. In a desperate attempt to save Boq's life, Elphaba turns Boq into the Tin Woodman. Unlike in the novel, Boq plays a considerably condensed role in the stage production. In the original Broadway production, he was played by Christopher Fitzgerald. Originally in the West End, James Gillan played the role. Boq in the television series Once Upon A Time In the season 5 episode, \\"Our Decay\\" Boq has a minor appearance when the Wicked Witch, Zelena, kills him by turning him into dust to find out who told Dorothy to return to Oz to defeat her.

The strike began on May 16, 1934 in the Market District (the modern day Warehouse District). The worst single day was Friday, July 20, called \\"Bloody Friday\\", when police shot at strikers in a downtown truck battle, killing two and injuring 67. Ensuing violence lasted periodically throughout the summer. The strike was formally ended on August 22. With a coalition formed by local leaders associated with the Trotskyist Communist League of America, a group that later founded the Socialist Workers Party (United States), the strike paved the way for the organization of over- the-road drivers and the growth of the Teamsters labor union. This strike, along with the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike and the 1934 Toledo Auto-Lite Strike led by the American Workers Party, were also important catalysts for the rise of industrial unionism in the 1930s, much of which was organized through the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Leadup to the strike The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, under the leadership of Daniel Tobin in 1933, was a conservative union averse to strikes. While the union's members were often called on to support other unions' strikes, since their role in transport brought them in contact with workers in many other unionized industries, and had developed strong traditions of solidarity in some areas, the International Union itself was cautious to the point of having resistance to striking whatsoever. The provisions of the International Constitution that required a two thirds vote of the membership to authorize any strike action and that gave the International President the power to withhold strike benefits if he believed that a local union had struck prematurely, It also divided its members into separate unions along craft or industry lines: ice wagon drivers in one local, produce drivers in another, milk drivers in a third, and so forth. The Teamsters also had a number of general locals; Local 574 in Minneapolis, which had no more than 75 members in 1934, was one of them. A number of militant members, including several Communist Party members who had gone to the newly formed Communist League of America (Left Opposition) in the internal split following Trotsky's expulsion, became members of Local 574 in the early 1930s. These militants ‚Äì Ray Dunne, his brothers Miles and Grant, Carl Skoglund and later Farrell Dobbs ‚Äì began by organizing coal drivers through a strike in the coldest part of 1933 that ignored both the cumbersome approval procedures established under the International's Constitution and the ineffective mediation procedures offered under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The victory gave the union a great deal of credibility among both drivers and their employers. The union began organizing drivers wherever they could be found. The union also began preparing for the strike in a number of ways. It rented a large hall that could be used as a strike headquarters, kitchen and infirmary. It organized a women's auxiliary to staff the headquarters. Finally, it entered into discussions with the sympathetic leaders of organizations of farmers and the unemployed to obtain their support for the upcoming strike. The strike The strike began on May 16, 1934. The strike was remarkably effective, shutting down most commercial transport in the city with the exception of certain farmers, who were allowed to bring their produce into town, but delivering directly to grocers, rather than to the market area, which the union had shut down. The market was to be the scene of the fiercest fighting during the earliest part of the strike. On Saturday, May 19, 1934, Minneapolis Police and private guards beat a number of strikers trying to prevent strikebreakers from unloading a truck in that area and waylaid several strikers who had responded to a report that scab drivers were unloading newsprint at the two major dailies' loading docks. When those injured strikers were brought back to the strike headquarters the police followed; the strikers, however, not only refused to let the police into the headquarters, but left two of them unconscious on the sidewalk outside. Fighting intensified the following Monday, May 21, when the police, augmented by several hundred newly deputized members of the Citizens Alliance, an employer organization, attempted to open up the market for trucking. Fighting began when a loaded truck began leaving a loading dock. The battle became a general melee when hundreds of pickets armed with clubs of all sorts rushed to the area to support the picketers; when the police drew their guns as if to shoot, the union sent a truck loaded with picketers into the mass of police and deputies in order to make it impossible for them to fire without shooting each other. Other unions, particularly in the building trades, began to strike in sympathy with the Teamsters. The American Federation of Labor's Central Labor Council in Minneapolis offered financial and moral support for the strike, allowing the union to coordinate some of its picketing activities from its headquarters. The fighting resumed on Tuesday, May 22. The picketers took the offensive and succeeded in driving both police and deputies from the market and the area around the union's headquarters. Of the several hundred deputized \\"special police\\", two (C. Arthur Lyman and Peter Erath) were cornered and killed. In the following \\"general riot\\" another roughly two dozen special police, municipal police, and strikers were beaten or wounded. Negotiations The Central Labor Council, the Building Trades Council and the Teamsters Joint Council approached Mike Johannes, the Minneapolis Chief of Police, to propose a truce, under which the local would cease picketing for twenty-four hours if the police and the employers ceased trying to move trucks. The employers, the Teamsters and the building trades signed a formal truce agreement. Johannes, however, declared that the police would move trucks once the truce expired, leading the union to announce that it was resuming picketing. At this point city government appealed for Governor Floyd B. Olson to mobilize the National Guard, the 34th Infantry Division (United States) under Adjutant General Ellard A. Walsh.Johnson, Jack (Winter 2012). \\"Allies\\". Newsletter for Members and Friends of the Military Historical Society of Minnesota. XX (1): 1‚Äì3.\\"The 34th 'Red Bull' Infantry Division 1917 - 2010\\" (PDF). Minnesota Military Museum. Retrieved 3 June 2013. Olson did, but stopped short of actually deploying them, unwilling to alienate his labor supporters. Olson had already been attempting to mediate the dispute, On May 25, the employers and the union reached an agreement on a contract that provided union recognition, reinstatement for all strikers, seniority and a no-discrimination clause. The membership approved it overwhelmingly. The strike resumes The union thought that it had the employers' agreement to include the \\"inside workers\\", the warehouse employees as well as the drivers and loaders. When the employers reneged on that agreement the strike resumed on Tuesday, July 17. Governor Olson again mobilized, but did not deploy, the National Guard. The union's leadership had chosen to use different tactics in this strike; it ordered its members to picket without carrying any clubs or weapons of any sort. The police, on the other hand, armed themselves with riot guns which sprayed buckshot over a wide arc. On Friday, July 20, a single yellow truck drove to the central market escorted by fifty armed policemen. The truck made the small delivery successfully, but a vehicle carrying picketers wielding clubs cut off the truck. The police opened fire on the vehicle with shotguns, then turned their guns on the strikers filling the surrounding streets. An eyewitness reported that as the pickets moved to aid their fallen comrades, \\"They flowed directly into buckshot fire ... And the cops let them have it as they picked up their wounded. Lines of living, solid men fell, broke, wavering.\\" He also said he saw one man \\"stepping on his own intestines, bright and bursting in the street, and another holding his severed arm in his right hand.\\" By the end of hostilities, two strikers (Henry Ness and John Belor) were dead and sixty-seven wounded. The police violence sparked a show of support from other unions and a one-day strike of transport workers. Each side stepped back from the confrontation: Chief Johannes and Mayor Bainbridge faced calls for their impeachment, while the union continued to urge its members not to give the police any justification for further attacks, disarming a number of picketers who wanted to return fire with fire. The union did not make any overt efforts to stop those few trucks accompanied by convoys of forty police cars apiece that tried to deliver goods, but sent so many cars with pickets to accompany those convoys that the police were never able to shepherd more than a few delivery trucks on any given day. Martial law and settlement A public commission, set up later by the governor, reported: On July 26, and these deaths of protesters at the hands of the police, Farmer- Labor governor Olson declared martial law and mobilized four thousand National Guardsmen of the 34th Infantry. Following this mobilization, there was no further loss of life. Between July 26 and August 1, the National Guard began issuing operating permits to truck drivers, and engaging in roving patrols, curfews, and security details. On August 1, National Guard troops seized strike headquarters and placed arrested union leaders in a stockade at the state fairgrounds in Saint Paul. The next day, the headquarters were restored to the union and the leaders released from the stockade, as the National Guard carried out a token raid on the Citizens Alliance headquarters. The union appealed to the Central Labor Union for a general strike and the governor issued an ultimatum that he would stop all trucks by midnight, August 5, if there was no settlement. Nevertheless, by August 14, there were thousands of trucks operating under military permits. Although the strike was gravely weakened by martial law and economic pressure, union leaders made it clear that it would continue. On August 21, a federal mediator got acceptance of a settlement proposal from A. W. Strong, head of the Citizens Alliance, incorporating the union's major demands. The settlement was ratified and the back of employer resistance to unionization in Minneapolis was broken. In March 1935, International president Daniel Tobin expelled Local 574 from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). However, in August 1936, Tobin was forced to relent and recharter the local as 544. The leaders of 544 went on to develop the area and conference bargaining that exists today in the IBT. Local 544 remained under socialist leadership until 1941, when eighteen leaders of the union and the Socialist Workers Party were sentenced to federal prison, the first victims of the anti-radical Smith Act, a law eventually found by the United States Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. Names of members sentenced to prison: James P.Cannon, Grace Carlson, Jake Cooper, Oscar Coover, Harry DeBoer, Farrell Dobbs, V.R. Dunne, Max Geldman, Albert Goldman, Clarence Hamel, Emil Hansen, Carlos Hudson, Karl Kuehn, Felix Morrow, Edward Palmquist, Alfred Russel, Oscar Schoenfeld, Carl Skoglund. Impact The strike changed Minneapolis, which had been an open shop citadel under the control of the Citizens Alliance for years before 1934. In the aftermath of this strike thousands of other workers in other industries organized with the assistance of Local 574. The strike also gave the Communist League, later renamed the Workers Party of America, a strong position in Local 574, and in other Teamster locals within the metropolitan area of Minneapolis. Trotskyist strength grew to over 100 members. This gave leadership to the Trotskyists through the various unions they led within the Central Labor Council. As mentioned below, through organizing the first area-wide contract for any union outside of rail, the Trotskyists established locals of their party wherever there were Teamster locals, from South Dakota to Iowa to Colorado. The party was later driven out of that local by prosecutions under the Smith Act and a trusteeship imposed by Tobin in the early 1940s. More importantly, the strike launched the career of Farrell Dobbs, who played a significant role in the organization of over-the-road drivers throughout the Midwest. Those efforts led in turn to the transformation of the Teamsters from a craft union, made up of locals with a parochial focus on their own craft and locality, into a truly national union.

Since the 1990s, he has performed in supporting and lead roles as a comedy actor in Tamil films. While having worked in more than 200 films, Vadivelu received awards in the Best Comedian category for his performances in Kaalam Maari Pochu (1996), Vetri Kodi Kattu (2000), Thavasi (2001), Chandramukhi (2005), Imsai Arasan 23m Pulikesi (2006), Marudhamalai (2007) and Kathavarayan (2008). His popularity led to his media-coined nickname, Vaigai Puyal, meaning \\"Vaigai storm\\", referring to the river that flows through his hometown Madurai. Early life Vadivelu was born on 12 September 1960 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu to Natarajan Pillai and Sarojini. Vadivelu has four children, three daughters, Kannigaparameswari, Karthiga, Kalaivani,, and a son, Subramaniyan. Vadivelu did not have a formal education, instead he worked in his father's glass cutting business and continued it with his brothers after his father's passing. In his free time, he participated in local stage plays, usually in a comic role. Career=Early stage (1988‚Äì1997) In 1988, he was launched through a small character in T. Rajendar‚Äôs En Thangai Kalyani. Vadivelu had a difficult first few years, since the dominance of Goundamani and Senthil left very little space for emerging comedians. Vadivelu met Rajkiran on a train while on his way to Chennai to visit his bride-to-be. Rajkiran later recalled that he was so amused by their conversation during the train ride that he agreed to give Vadivelu a role in his upcoming film, En Rasavin Manasile (1991), directed by Kasthuri Raja. It was also the beginning of the Goundamani-Senthil-Vadivelu combination that produced a few skits in the early ‚Äô90s. Vadivelu played contrasting characters in two Kamal Haasan starrers in 1992. Vadivelu joined Goundamani and Charle as the hero‚Äôs friends in Singaravelan. In Thevar Magan, Vadivelu played Esaki, a worker in patriarch Sivaji Ganesan‚Äôs household. Esaki loses an arm during caste clashes. Perhaps the most famous of these was the tender coconut sequence in Koyil Kaalai (1993), in which Senthil and Vadivelu steal from Goundamani‚Äôs shop to start their own business. Vadivelu‚Äôs first solo came in director Shankar‚Äôs Kadhalan (1994), in which he played the friend of Prabhu Deva‚Äôs college student character. They were also considered sidekicks for an older generation of heroes, which included Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth. As younger heroes such as Ajith Kumar, Vijay and Prabhu Deva began rising in prominence, the script required fresh faces for the role of the comedian. Vadivelu along with his rival Vivek would play the roles. Such roles played in tandem with actor Parthiban. Vadivelu did as many as 15 to 20 movies a year. Vadivelu is known to assist directors, with his own input being used during sets In Friends, The film, which released in 2001, opened to positive reviews. Sundar C.‚Äôs He later went on to perform numerous roles, including Giri, Chandramukhi, Thalainagaram, Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei, Marudhamalai and Kathavarayan. As the lead role in the film Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei, Vadivelu played the dual role of a heartless but comical dictator king and a revolutionary. In the film he played the role of hero, villain and comedian at the same time. His next lead role was in Indiralogathil Na Azhagappan . Controversies and decline (2008‚Äì2017) On 21 September 2008, Vadivelu's residence in the Saligramam neighbourhood in Chennai was pelted with stones by a gang, leaving several windows broken and furniture damaged. The actor had taken refuge in a room in his home and was safe. Vadivelu is said to have suspected Vijayakanth because of a recent case that he had filed against the latter for assault and because the final court hearing was to take place the following day. He suspected that the attack may have been carried out to prevent Vadivelu from attending the hearing. As a result, Vadivelu filed another case against Vijayakanth for attempted murder. He later mentioned his interest in contesting against Vijayakanth in the upcoming assembly elections and in his words, \\"teaching him a lesson.\\" In response, actor Vijayakanth, in a press meet on 22 September, claimed that Vadivelu's allegations were based on hearsay. In 2010, Vadivelu held a press conference, accusing fellow comedian and actor Singamuthu for forgery and financial cheating. Vadivelu, who was previously friends with Singamuthu, purchased land from him but later came to learn that the documents were void. This resulted in the former taking legal action against the latter. During the legislative assembly elections that place in Tamil Nadu during April 2011, Vadivelu vehemently campaigned for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and its alliance. During his public speeches, he predominantly condemned politician and actor Vijayakanth, whose party, the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), allied with the opposition party All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), headed by Jayalalithaa. His allegations of Vijayakanth included him being a \\"drunkard\\". In a campaign speech in Tiruvarur, Vadivelu stated that \\"(his) only aim is to sweep out Vijayakanth's whole team and to campaign vigorously for DMK's victory\\". Vadivelu was criticised as being biased, only supporting a DMK-led victory for personal gains and not once mentioning anything against the official opposition, the AIADMK, or its leader. In a turn of events, the election was eventually successful for the AIADMK alliance, and Vijaykanth won his constituency by a considerable margin. As his career as a lead actor was waning, Vadivelu chose to return to portraying supporting and comedy roles in films headlined by other actors. He portrayed a role alongside Vishal in Suraj's Kaththi Sandai (2016), before collaborating again with P. Vasu in the horror comedy Shivalinga (2017). Vadivelu then portrayed a supporting role alongside Vijay in Mersal (2017), with the film becoming a blockbuster at the box office. A critic from The New Indian Express noted that it was a \\"brilliant comeback for Vadivelu\\" and that \\"his comedy is subtle, yet sufficient\\". Banning (2018‚Äìpresent) After agreeing to work with Chimbu Deven on Imsai Arasan 24th Pulikecei, a sequel to their successful film, he fell out with the director over an issue regarding his costume designer and subsequently refused to cooperate. The film's producers, S. Shankar and Subaskaran Allirajah, later filed a legal case over his unexplained absence. Likewise, R. K. and Stephen, the producers of Neeyum Naanum Naduvula Peyum and another untitled film, also opted to file complaints to the Nadigar Sangam against Vadivelu's lack of cooperation. The Tamil Film Producers Council issued a ban against casting Vadivelu in future films. In 2019, Vadivelu was interviewed by Behindwoods, in which he criticized Chimbu Deven and Shankar for their creative differences. Producer T. Siva and director Naveen (who worked as an assistant to Chimbu Deven in Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikesi) spoke out against Vadivelu‚Äôs comments. Acclaim=Acting style Vadivelu's roles involve heavy use of slapstick and puns, which has led him to be typecast. His comedy sequences typically end with him getting soundly thrashed and a closing one-liner from him bemoaning his situation or antagonists. His popularity could be ascribed to the general audience being able to identify with him thanks to his rustic looks, accent and body language. Popularity Vadivelu's dialogues served as an inspiration for memes in social media. Many meme creators use Vadivelu's dialogues for all ongoing situations in the world to express irony. His dialogues have been part of daily conversation and also inspired the titles for various Tamil films. In 2019, Vadivelu was featured in the sudden viral memes related to the hashtag Pray for Nesamani.

It is bounded by the comuni of Calciano, Campomaggiore, Cirigliano, Oliveto Lucano, Pietrapertosa, San Mauro Forte and Stigliano. Geography The territory is half covered by forests and pastures. Around the commune there are the Manche, Gallipoli, Montepiano, Vallefredda and Tempacortaglie mountains. Accettura is above sea level and is bordered to the north with the comunes of Campomaggiore and Calciano, to the east with Oliveto Lucano and San Mauro Forte, to the south with Stigliano and Cirigliano, and to the west with Pietrapertosa (PZ). Etymology The term, according to some, is derived from the theme of the word \\"acceptor\\", which in Latin is Accipiter. For others, it stems from the symbol of the country, to accept a small plot of land, etc. History The first official mention of Accettura in documents was by Pope Nicholas II in 1060, who sent a document sent to the bishop of Tricarico, referring to it as \\"Achitorem\\". Situated in the Appennino Lucano in the Gallipoli-Cognato Park, was founded in the 10th century after the local population had abandoned three neighbouring villages. Nowadays the population work mainly in agriculture, stock-breeding and tourism. In the tenth century was a feudal territory of Montescaglioso. In 1272, the town was completely destroyed by fire. Shortly after, Charles I of Anjou ordered its reconstruction. Throughout its history, Accettura was owned by several families: Bazzano, Della Marra, the Ponsiaco, the Carafa, and the Spinelli who held it until the late nineteenth century.

The \\"kitsune no yomeiri\\" can refer to several things: atmospheric ghost lights, a phenomenon during which it appears as if paper lanterns from a wedding procession are floating through the dark; what is commonly referred to as a sunshower; and various strange wedding processions that can be seen in classical Japanese kaidan, essays, and legends. The \\"kitsune no yomeiri\\" is always closely related to foxes, or kitsune (who often play tricks on humans in Japanese legend) and various Shinto rituals and festive rights relating to the \\"kitsune no yomeiri\\" have been developed in various parts of Japan. As atmospheric ghost lights A topography book of the Echigo Province (now Niigata Prefecture), from the H≈çreki period, the \\"Echigo Nayose\\" (Ë∂äÂæåÂêçÂØÑ), includes the following statement about the appearance of the \\"kitsune no yomeiri\\": In here, lines of atmospheric ghost lights that stretch close to 4 kilometers are called \\"kitsune no kon\\", and also in Nakakubiki District, Niigata Prefecture, and Uonuma of the same prefecture, the Akita Prefecture, Sakuragawa, Ibaraki Prefecture, Nanakai, Nishiibaraki District of the same prefecture (now Shirosato), Hitachi≈çta of the same prefecture, Koshigaya, Saitama Prefecture, Higashichichibu of the same prefecture, the Tama area of Tokyo, the Gunma Prefecture, the Tochigi Prefecture, Mukawa, Hokuto, Yamanashi Prefecture, the Mie Prefecture, Kashihara, Nara Prefecture, and Nanbu, Saihaku District, Tottori Prefecture, among other places, when atmospheric ghost lights (kitsunebi) are seen in the countryside at night, it is called \\"kitsune no yomeiri.\\" What it is called varies depending on area; for example, the phenomenon is called \\"kitsune no yometori (Áãê„ÅÆÂ´ÅÂèñ„Çä, the fox's wife-taking)\\" in S≈çka, Saitama Prefecture and Noto, Fugeshi District, Ishikawa Prefecture (now Noto, H≈çsu District) while referred to as \\"kitsune no sh≈´gen\\" (Áãê„ÅÆÁ•ùË®Ä) in Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture. In Japan, holding a wedding in a specific place did not become common until the middle of the Showa period. Prior to this, it was common for weddings to be performed in the evening and for the bride to enter with a procession of paper lanterns. Since atmospheric ghost lights that extend in a line can look like lanterns and torches from a wedding ceremony, and since paper lanterns were known to be used during a fox's wedding ceremony, they were thus called such names. There are several theories as to why the bride and groom are seen as foxes. One such theory says that although the lights appeared to be signifying a wedding, there was actually no wedding anywhere and the entire thing was an elaborate trick played by foxes. Because the mysterious lights looked like paper lanterns from afar but disappeared once one got close, it was almost as if one was being fooled by a fox. In the past, in Toyoshima in Edo (now Toshima, Kita ward, Tokyo, and Ouji, of the same ward), for atmospheric ghost lights to continuously appear and quiver and shake around in the darkness is called \\"kitsune no yomeiri,\\" and is counted as one of the \\"seven mysteries of Toshima\\" told about in this village. In Kirinzan, Niigata Prefecture, there lived many foxes, and it is said that there was a wedding procession at night that hanged paper lanterns. In Niigata as well as Shiki District, Nara Prefecture, a fox's wedding is thought to be connected to agriculture, and it is said that for many atmospheric ghost lights to appear means that it is a plentiful year, and for few of them to appear means it is year of poor crops. Depending on the area, there are legends including not only the sighting of atmospheric ghost lights but purported sightings of actual weddings as well. In Gy≈çda, Saitama Prefecture, it is said that kitsune no yomeiri frequently appears in the Kasuga Shrine in Tanigou, and it is reported that here and there along the road, fox feces can be found after one such reported event. In Horado, Mugi District, Gifu Prefecture (now Seki), it is said that it was not merely atmospheric ghost lights that were seen, but the sound of bamboo burning and tearing was also heard continuing for several days, but that there were no traces found even when an attempt was made to check what it was. In the Tokushima Prefecture, they were not considered fox's weddings, but rather fox's funerals, and were an omen that someone was about to die. Concerning the true identity of these atmospheric ghost lights, it is thought that perhaps people mistook it for lights that were actually there, or possibly the illusion from an unusual refraction of light. Legend related to the weather Situation immediately after a sunshower In the Kant≈ç region, Ch≈´bu region, Kansai region, Ch≈´goku region, Shikoku, Kyushu, among other places, sunshowers are called \\"kitsune no yomeiri.\\" Like atmospheric ghost lights, this phenomenon is called various names depending on area. In the Nanbu Region, Aomori Prefecture, it is called \\"kitsune no yometori\\" (Áãê„ÅÆÂ´ÅÂèñ„Çä, the fox's wife-taking), and in Serizawa, Chigasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture and the mountainous areas of Oe District, Tokushima Prefecture, it is called \\"kitsune-ame\\" (ÁãêÈõ®, fox rain),. In the eastern Isumi District, Chiba Prefecture, it is called \\"kitsune no sh≈´gen\\" (Áãê„ÅÆÁ•ùË®Ä). In the Higashi-Katsushika District, Chiba Prefecture, it is referred to as \\"kitsune no yometori ame\\" (Áãê„ÅÆÂ´ÅÂèñ„ÇäÈõ®, the fox's wife-taking rain) like in Aomori, but this stems from the fact that this area was once a farming area, and seeing as how wives were noted for their labor, wives were thought as ones who existed to be \\"taken\\" for the sake of the prosperity of the family. For sunshowers to be called this, there are various explanations, such as the explanation that for rain to fall even when the sky is clear gives the feeling like an impossible situation, one would feel like one is being tricked by something, and other than this, there is also the explanation that people believed that a fox's wedding would take place during a sunshower, as well as the explanation since mountain bases experienced a lot of rain even when the sky was clear, people thought that foxes made rain fall in order to prevent people from going up the mountain and seeing the fox's wedding, as well as the explanation that since there were wives who spilled tears even on a happy day, and they thus called forth such a strange weather as a sunshower, as well as the explanation that the words used to describe the strangeness of the atmospheric ghost lights written about above was also put to use to describe the strangeness of sunshine when rain was falling. The relation between a fox's wedding and the weather also differs by area, and in the Kumamoto Prefecture, it is when a rainbow appears, and in the Aichi Prefecture, it is when graupel falls that there is a fox's wedding. Classics and legends Fox's weddings were not merely phenomena of nature, but also things that were actually seen in the old literature of the Edo period as well as various legends depending on the area. There are various stories of strange wedding processions that were witnessed, and where there were actually foxes, like in the essay \\"Konjaku Y≈çdan Sh≈´\\" (‰ªäÊòîÂ¶ñË´áÈõÜ) of Kan'ei period of one taking place in Takemachi, in the Honjo area of Edo, as well as the written work \\"Edo Chirihiroi\\" (Ê±üÊà∏Â°µÊãæ) where one was seen at the Hacch≈ç canal in Edo, as well as the kaidan collection \\"Kaidan Oi no Tsue\\" (ÊÄ™Ë´áËÄÅ„ÅÆÊùñ) of the Kansei period where one was seen in the village of Kanda, K≈çzuke (now Gunma Prefecture). Stories of marriages between foxes that were shown to humans are disseminated country- wide. As an example, according to folk legend, in a legend of S≈çka, Saitama prefecture, in the Sengoku period, a certain woman promised to marry with her lover, but died to an illness, and foxes were inspired by the regretfulness of this situation, and thus it is said that a fox's wedding procession could be seen near the woman's grave. Also, according to a folktale in the Shinano Province (now Nagano Prefecture), there is a story where when an old man helped a little fox, he was eventually greeted by the wedding procession of the fox when it grew mature, and as a gift of thanks to the old man, he was taken along it. In stories of weddings like these, natural phenomena like those written about above as well as supernatural \\"kitsune no yomeiri\\", function like stage settings, and weddings that take place in the day frequently take place in a sunshower, and those that take place at night frequently take place among atmospheric ghost lights. There are also legends in various areas that one could see a fox's wedding by performing some specific actions, and in the Fukushima Prefecture, it is said that at evening in 10/10 on the lunisolar calendar, if one wears a suribachi on one's head, and sticks a wooden pestle in one's waist, and stand under a date plum, it is possible to see a fox's wedding, and in the Aichi Prefecture, it is said that if one spits in a well, intertwine one's fingers and look through a gap in between, one is able to see a fox's wedding. The Onabake Jinja in Ry≈´gasaki, Ibaraki Prefecture There are also stories of weddings not just between foxes, but also between a human male and a female fox, and as a representative work, which also became a ningy≈ç j≈çruri, there is the story about the birth of the Heian period onmyoji, Abe no Seimei in Kuzunoha. Other than this, there is also a similar tale in the Nihonkoku Genp≈ç Zen'aku Ry≈çiki, as well as in the \\"Tonegawa Zushi\\" (Âà©Ê†πÂ∑ùÂõ≥Âøó) a topography book published in 1857 (Ansei 5). The latter one concerns a commander Ê†óÊûóÁæ©Èï∑ who actually existed who was comparable with Zhuge Liang, and the town of Onabake (Â•≥Âåñ, literally \\"shapeshift into woman\\") in Ushiku, Ibaraki Prefecture got its name from this, and the a fox is deified in the Onabake Jinja in Ry≈´gasaki of the same prefecture. Also, in the Konjaku Monogatarish≈´ as well as the \\"Honch≈ç Koji Innen Sh≈´\\" (Êú¨ÊúùÊïÖ‰∫ãÂõ†Á∏ÅÈõÜ) published in 1689 (Genroku 2) and the \\"Tamahahaki\\" (ÁéâÊéÉÊú®) published in 1696 (Genroku 9), there is the story of a fox who appeared before a married man, shapeshifted and disguised as that person's wife. Also, in the kaidan collection \\"Tonoigusa\\" (ÂÆøÁõ¥Ëçâ) published in 1677 (Enp≈ç 5), there is the reverse story where a male fox fell in love with a female human, shapedshifted and disguised as that woman's husband and intercourse, and resulted in the birth of children with atypical appearance. \\"Kitsune no Yomeiri-zu\\" by Hokusai Katsushika Related works The \\"Kitsune no Yomeiri-zu\\" from the Edo period by the ukiyo-e artist Hokusai Katsushika was based upon this folk belief, and it depicted various people surprised by a fox's wedding procession and a sudden shower, and their bustle to take in their crop (refer to image). This has been pointed out to be an unusual example where the imaginary background of the foxes and the real customs of farming villages are depicted at the same time in a painting. In a poem of Kobayashi Issa, a haiku poet of the same era, there is one that read, \\"in the autumn flames and mountains, there is the rain of fox's weddings\\" (Áßã„ÅÆÁÅ´„ÇÑÂ±±„ÅØÁãê„ÅÆÂ´ÅÂÖ•Èõ®). Also, in the works of the Meiji period waka and haiku poet Kobayashi Issa, there was a tanka that read, \\"when the rain falls on the village from a blue sky at the hour of the horse, perhaps the king fox is getting married\\" (ÈùíÁ©∫„Å´„ÇÄ„ÇâÈõ®„Åô„Åê„ÇãÈ¶¨ÊôÇÁãê„ÅÆÂ§ßÁéãÂ¶ª„ÇÅ„Åô„Çâ„Çì„Åã).„Çà„ÇäÂºïÁî®„ÄÇ Also in the ningy≈ç j≈çruri \\"Dan no Ura Kabuto Gunki\\" (Â£áÊµ¶ÂÖúËªçË®ò) first performed in 1732, there was also \\"it was quite clear weather all the way up to now, but then I heard it, the playful rain of the fox's wedding\\" and in the period novel Onihei Hankach≈ç published after the war, there was one volume titled \\"fox rain\\" (ÁãêÈõ®). \\"Sh≈´gen Kitsune no Mukoiri.\\" It is determined to be a recent era work, but its time of creation and its creator is unknown. Other than that, in Edo period kusaz≈çshi and kiby≈çshi such as the Naimono Ku≈ç Kitsune no Mukoiri (ÁÑ°Áâ©Âñ∞ÁãêÂ©øÂÖ•) (illustrated by Kitao Masayoshi) published in 1785 (Tenmei 5), \\"Mukashigatari Kitsune Yomeiri\\" (ÊòîË™ûÁãêÂ®∂ÂÖ•) (illustrated by Kitao Shigemasa), and \\"Anasaka Kitsune Engumi\\" (Á©¥Ë≥¢ÁãêÁ∏ÅÁµÑ) (illustrated by Jippensha Ikku), as well as in Kamigata e-hon such as the \\"Sh≈´gen Kitsune no Mukoiri\\" and \\"Ehon Atsumegusa,\\" there are depictions of \\"foxes weddings\\" of humanized foxes going through weddings. There was a genre of works called \\"yomeiri mono\\" (Â´ÅÂÖ•„ÇäÁâ©, \\"wedding things\\") of humanized animals going through weddings, but foxes had the special characteristic of concretely having the name Inari no Kami attached to them. This is seen to be an indication that faith in the god Inari as well as \\"yomeiri mono\\" both deeply permeated among the common people. Among common people, in Akaoka, K≈çchi Prefecture (now K≈çnan) among other places, there is the children's song \\"when rain falls in good weather, it's the fox's wedding\\" (Êó•Âíå„Å´Èõ®„ÅåÈôç„Çä„ÇÉ Áãê„ÅÆÂ´ÅÂÖ•„Çä, hiyori ni ame ga furya, kitsune no yomeiri),„Çà„ÇäÂºïÁî®„ÄÇ„Çà„ÇäÂºïÁî®„ÄÇ and it is said that an actual fox's wedding precession was seen on a day of a sunshower. Akira Kurosawa showed the Kitsune no yomeiri in his film Dreams (1990 film),ÈªíÊæ§Êòé Áõ£Áù£Êò†Áîª„ÄéÂ§¢ „Äè„ÄåÊó•ÁÖß„ÇäÈõ®„ÄçÔºà1990Âπ¥Ôºâ„ÄÇ where Sunshine Through The Rain is the first scene. There was also a song made called \\"The Fox's Wedding\\"/\\"Áãê„ÅÆÂ´ÅÂÖ•„Çä\\" by Japanese music producer -MASA Works DESIGN- featuring the voicebanks of Vocaloid's Hatsune Miku and GUMI. The song is part of a series called \\"The Story of the Kitsune and the Demon\\"/\\"Áãê„Å®È¨º„ÅÆË©±\\" (Also referred to as The Onibi series) which tell the stories of two families and the curse placed on the daughter of one family after the Kitsune, the daughter of the other family, was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the mother of the former's family. Related events Due to the fox's wedding precession in Kirinzan in the Niigata Prefecture written about previously, the Kitsune no Yomeiri Gy≈çretsu is performed in the Tsugawa region, Aga, Higashikanbara in the same prefecture. Originally a place famous for kitsunebi, an event related to kitsunebi was performed starting from Sh≈çwa 27, and it ceased once, in 1990 the sightseeing event with the wedding precession (yomeiri gy≈çretsu) as its core was revived, and every year, it flourishes with about 40 thousand sightseers. Also in the Hanaoka Tokufuku Inari-sha in Kudamatsu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, in the Inari festival held in November 3 every year, the \\"kitsune no yomeiri\\" is performed. This is not related to either atmospheric ghost lights or sunshowers, but is rather a re-enactment of a wedding between foxes, and is due to the efforts of volunteers after the old practice of praying for good harvest at the Inari festival at that shrine ceased in the chaos of the postwar period, and the re-enactment refers to the fact a white fox couple at that shrine was looking for something lost, and was deified as a god of good harvest and thriving business. The ones who perform as the fox couple are selected among the people of Kudamatsu, but it is said that as the female who plays the part of one of the newlywed is going to be blessed with a good match, there is a benefit to a marriage at that same shrine. Also, in the Suzakihamamiyashinemei Jinja in Miyado, Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, during setsubun, a shinto ritual called \\"kitsune no yomeiri d≈çch≈´ (the fox's wedding journey)\\" is performed. This was also a ritual performed in the Edo period, but this was also a practice revived in the postwar period, and a man and woman who were in a yakudoshi or \\"unlucky age\\" that year would dress up as a little fox, the head envoy of the gods, and a girl fox, the envoy of the god of Suzakihamamiyashinemei Jinja, and then re-enact a wedding, which at that time it can be seen to flourish with several tens of thousands of visitors to the shrine.

History In the early 1960s the Australian Consumers Association unsuccessfully attempted to establish state and territory Branches. The first state or territory based consumer organisation was Canberra Consumers, established in 1963 by Michael Vernon, Godfrey Linge and Bill Howitt. By the late 1970s most states and territories had their own consumer group. It soon became apparent that lack of coordinated action by these consumer lobby groups was obstructing political change. With the election of Gough Whitlam and the Labor Government in 1972, the Government encouraged the disparate consumer groups to join together and form the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO). In 1974 after a meeting of 27 consumer groups, led by the Australian Consumers' Association and Canberra Consumers, a constitution was drafted and AFCO was officially founded. AFCO's foundation membership included Canberra Consumers, the Country Women's Association, the Australian Consumers Association and the Consumer Action Movement. Policy Priorities The policy priorities of AFCO reflected the main consumer concerns of the decade. In the 1970s it was the establishment of product standards, trade practices law, social justice and the effects of inflation on consumers. In the 1980s the policies of interest for AFCO were product labelling, competition, media ownership and health. In the 1990s the issues were National Competition Policy, media ownership, environmental issues, product safety, tobacco control, financial services and banking and deregulation. In 1994, for ease of reference, AFCO was renamed the Consumers' Federation of Australia (CFA). Defunding In 1996, John Howard and the Liberal National Party Coalition won power. One of its first actions with regard to consumer affairs was the complete defunding of CFA. Prior to the election the CFA had nine full-time staff working for it. After the defunding decision, the CFA had only one part-time paid staff member. And after twelve months, the only staff members remaining were voluntary. CFA continues to operate to this day, but only as a voluntary organisation, making only limited contributions to national debate regarding issues affecting consumer affairs.

The main line, built by the Boston and Worcester Street Railway, was an interurban streetcar line partly on the old Boston and Worcester Turnpike (now Route 9) and partly on private right-of-way. Long after the line was converted to buses, Boston and Worcester Lines took over operations, and sold the franchises to various other bus companies. In Newton, the B&W; was granted a franchise in exchange for constructing a 90-foot (27 m) wide boulevard, of which it ran down the median. The B&W; also carried freight. History The B&W;'s Framingham Junction waiting room on an early postcard The Boston and Worcester Street Railway was chartered November 16, 1901. Service between Boston and Framingham Junction began on May 5, 1903. (The line operated over the Boston Elevated Railway in Brookline and Boston; these trackage rights had been granted in December 1900 after a brief controversy. ) Service between Worcester and Chestnut Hill began on July 1, 1903; Worcester‚ÄìBoston service began five days later. Running time between the terminal was two hours and fifteen minutes; this was slower than Boston and Albany Railroad trains, but the B&W; cost 40 cents versus the railroad's one-dollar fare. Service operated every half-hour, with short turn cars providing fifteen-minute frequency east of Framingham. Boston and Worcester Electric Companies was incorporated December 29, 1902 to serve as a holding company. The B&W; arranged control of several connecting roads in 1899 and purchased them in 1903‚Äì04: *The Framingham Union Street Railway ran local service within Framingham. It operated a Framingham Center‚ÄìSouth Framingham that connected to the B&W; mainline at the former point, and a Saxonville‚ÄìSouth Framingham line that intersected the B&W; at Framingham Junction. *The Framingham, Southborough and Marlborough Street Railway and its subsidiary Marlborough and Framingham Street Railway operated a line between Hudson and Framingham Center via Marlborough and Southborough. The B&W; used this line between Fayville and Framingham Center. The B&W; opened a short branch to Natick Center in 1909. In 1925‚Äì26, the B&W; attempted to replace its entire service with buses, but was rebuffed by Brookline. However, the Framingham‚ÄìFramingham Centre and Framingham Junction‚ÄìSaxonville routes were replaced by buses on June 13, 1925. On July 3, 1926, the B&W; began operating a Boston‚ÄìWorcester bus line that followed the turnpike west of Shrewsbury, and the Post Road east of Northborough. The Hudson branch was replaced by buses in April 1928, followed by the Natick branch on October 15. Framingham Junction‚ÄìFramingham service ended in September 1930. The line was cut back to Framingham on January 15, 1931, as paving of the turnpike progressed eastward, with buses replacing the western half. On June 11, 1932, the eastern half of the line was replaced with buses as well. Lines Map The main line ran along the old Boston and Worcester Turnpike (Route 9) except in the following places: *In Worcester, the tracks used Shrewsbury Street to get downtown. *Just east of the bridge over Lake Quinsigamond, the tracks split. One pair followed the south-east shore of the lake along a private right-of-way to a dead end. The main tracks ran slightly south of Route 9 until they crossed the turnpike at South Shrewsbury (the bridge on route 9 carries traffic over the former alignment)https://www.historicaerials.com/location/42.276213287625936/-71.72453284263611/1938/17 and then continued on the north side until they merged with the turnpike at the Northborough/Westborough border. *North of Westborough center, at the crossing with current Route 135, the tracks split to the south (behind the former Bergson's 1790 House), rejoining the turnpike at Breakneck Hill Road (just east of Route 85) in Southborough. Breakneck Hill Road is where the older tracks of the Framingham, Southboro and Marlborough Street Railway split to head north to Marlborough and Hudson. *At the Boston end, the line ran to the end of Huntington Avenue, the old turnpike, and continued on to Park Square. The section in Worcester was on trackage rights from the Worcester Consolidated Street Railway (on their \\"City Hall and Lake\\" line), and in Boston it used the tracks of the Boston Elevated Railway. At Framingham Junction, the crossing with current Route 126 in Framingham, many cars from Boston turned south to end at downtown Framingham (\\"South Framingham\\"). This junction was at the crossing of the older Framingham Union Street Railway line to Saxonville. Former right-of-way of the branch to Natick, photographed in 2016 The other lines were as follows: *Splitting from the main line at Fayville (Breakneck Hill Road) and heading north via Southborough and Marlborough to Hudson, originally owned by the Framingham, Southboro and Marlborough Street Railway (along with the main line east to Framingham Center). *Downtown Framingham northeast to Saxonville, roughly if not fully via current Route 126. This was originally owned by the Framingham Union Street Railway, and crossed the main line at Framingham Junction. *Downtown Framingham northwest to Framingham Center via Union Avenue, originally part of the Framingham Union Street Railway. Before the consolidation into the B&W;, an interchange with the Framingham, Southboro and Marlborough Street Railway existed at Framingham Center. Other local routes may have existed.

Yarra Park (35.469 hectares)Yarra Park, Melbourne, Victoria is part of the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct, the premier sporting precinct of Victoria, Australia. Located in Yarra Park is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and numerous sporting fields and ovals, including the associated sporting complexes of Melbourne & Olympic Parks. The park and sporting facilities are located in the inner-suburb of East Melbourne. In the late 1850s, many of the earliest games of Australian rules football were played at Yarra Park, which was known at the time as the Richmond Paddock. Tree-lined paths run parallel to Punt Road and Swan Street, and criss-cross the park. Some of the lawns are used for parking for sporting events. Three footbridges allow pedestrians and cyclists to cross the railway lines to the different sporting venues and easy access to the Yarra River Trail. Around the MCG are sculptures of Australian sporting heroes including: Australian rules footballers Ron Barassi and Dick Reynolds; cricketers Sir Donald Bradman and Keith Miller; athletics \\"golden girl\\" Betty Cuthbert. Nearby is an old eucalyptus scar tree which shows a big scar caused by harvesting of bark for a canoe by the original inhabitants of the Yarra River Valley, the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation.

A pavilion at the Melbourne Cricket Ground can be seen on the left in the background. Yarra Park In 1856, Victorian Governor Charles La Trobe proclaimed 81 hectares of parkland, extending from Punt Road to Swanston Street, and from Wellington Parade to the Yarra River. Initially the area was also used as police paddocks for the agistment of police horses. The earliest recorded matches of Australian rules football were played at the Richmond Paddock in 1858. The Argus wrote the following year: \\"Football, like cricket, has become an institution ... expect to see every available portion of Richmond Paddock, and other 'lungs of the city', dotted by animated groups in full pursuit of the leathern spheroid.\\"The Argus, 18 April 1859. It remained an important site for the sport until the MCG and other cricket grounds were opened for football in the late 1870s. By the 1860s five recreational ovals were marked out: the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Richmond Cricket Ground, East Melbourne Cricket Club ovals (two), and an oval in Gosch's Paddock, south of Swan Street. In the southern section of the park land was set aside for the Friendly Society's Gardens (now Olympic Park), and the Scotch College oval. In 1874 Yarra Park Primary School was opened in the north east corner of the park. A housing subdivision was excised from the park in 1881. Since this time major excisions have been made for Melbourne's eastern and southeastern rail lines, the Hurstbridge railway line, Olympic Park Sporting Complex, Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park's National Tennis Centre. However, Gosch's Paddock still links Yarra Park to the Yarra River at the Morrell Bridge for cyclists and pedestrians.

Biography Galich is a pen name, an abbreviation of his last name, first name, and patronymic: Ginzburg Alexander Arkadievich. He was born on 19 October 1918 in Ekaterinoslav (then Dnipropetrovsk and now Dnipro), Ukraine, into a family of Jewish intellectuals. His father, Aron Samoilovich Ginzburg, was an economist, and his mother, Fanni Borisovna Veksler, worked in a music conservatory. For most of his childhood he lived in Sevastopol. Before World War II, he entered the Gorky Literary Institute, then moved to Konstantin Stanislavski's Operatic-Dramatic Studio, and then to the Studio-Theatre of Alexei Arbuzov and Valentin Pluchek (in 1939). He wrote plays and screenplays, and in the late 1950s, he started to write songs and sing them accompanying himself on his guitar. Influenced by the Russian city romance tradition and the art of Alexander Vertinsky, Galich developed his own voice within the genre. He practically single-handedly created the genre of \\"bard song\\". Many of his songs spoke of the Second World War and the lives of concentration camp inmates‚Äîsubjects which Vladimir Vysotsky also began tackling at around the same time. They became popular with the public and were made available via magnitizdat. His first songs, though rather innocent politically, nevertheless were distinctly out of tune with the official Soviet aesthetics. They marked a turning point in Galich's creative life, since before this, he was a quite successful Soviet man of letters. This turn was also brought about by the aborted premiere of his play Matrosskaya Tishina written for the newly opened Sovremennik Theatre. The play, already rehearsed, was banned by censors, who claimed that the author had a distorted view of the role of Jews in the Great Patriotic War. This incident was later described by Galich in the story Generalnaya Repetitsiya (Dress Rehearsal). Galich's increasingly sharp criticism of the Soviet regime in his music caused him many problems. After it was established in 1970, the dissident Committee on Human Rights in the USSR included Galich as an honorary member. In 1971, he was expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union, which he had joined in 1955. In 1972, he was expelled from the Union of Cinematographers. That year he became baptized in the Eastern Orthodox Church by Alexander Men. Galich was forced to emigrate from the Soviet Union in 1974. He initially lived in Norway for one year, where he made his first recordings outside of the USSR. These were broadcast by him on Radio Liberty. His songs critical towards the Soviet government became immensely popular in the underground scene in the USSR. He later moved to Munich and finally to Paris. On the evening of 15 December 1977, he was found dead by his wife, clutching a Grundig stereo recording antenna plugged into a power socket. While his death was declared to be an accident,Mikhail Aronov. Alexander Galich. Full Biography.

In 2003, the first memorial plaque for Galich was put up on a building in Akademgorodok (Novosibirsk) where he performed in 1968. That same year, the Alexander Galich Memorial Society was founded. Music Alexander Galich, like most bards, had a fairly minimal musical background. He played his songs on a seven string Russian guitar, which was fairly standard at the time. He often wrote in the key of D minor, relying on very simple chord progressions and fingerpicking techniques. He had basic piano playing skills as well. Galich had a signature cadence that he would usually play at the conclusion of a song (and sometimes at the beginning). He would play the D minor chord toward the top of the fretboard (fret position 0XX0233, thickest to thinnest string, open G tuning), then slide down the fretboard to a higher voiced D minor (0 X X 0 10 10 12).

The game is set in the fictional Eastern Bloc country of Lasria, and centers on protagonist Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a morally ambivalent CIA \\"clean-up man\\". While trying to intercept rogue agent named Robert Mezner, Hayden's right arm is infected with the fictional Technocyte virus, which gives him the ability to grow a three-pronged \\"Glaive\\" at will. Dark Sector received mixed to positive reviews for its visual design, originality of action and weapon-based gameplay. Many critics have compared the game to Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War, for their similar style of play and story. Gameplay Hayden using his Glaive to fight Lasrian soldiers Gameplay of Dark Sector revolves around the use of the Glaive, a tri-blade throwing weapon similar to a boomerang which returns to Hayden after each throw. The Glaive can be used for long-distance combat, solving environmental puzzles, and picking up in-game items. When in close proximity to an enemy, context-sensitive actions may appear, allowing the player to execute enemies with \\"finishers\\". Enemies hold onto Hayden while attacking, and the player must rapidly press a randomly prompted button to break free. Environmental puzzles in the game usually focus upon capturing various elements (fire, electricity, or ice) with the Glaive. For example, a web blocking Hayden's path can be bypassed by capturing fire with the Glaive, and then launching it at the web to burn it down. The Glaive can also be dual- wielded with a gun, which allows the player to perform weapon combos which are more effective against shielded enemies. As the game progresses, Hayden and the Glaive are given several new abilities; it can be guided through the air, being able to kill multiple enemies; a charged-up throw for deadlier attacks; and the ability to make Hayden invisible for a short time and provide a temporary shield. The camera is positioned over the shoulder for third-person shooting, and the player can take cover by standing next to an object such as a pillar or wall. While in cover, Hayden can move temporarily out of cover to fire and throw the Glaive; however there is no blind firing from behind cover. There is a sprint function, which works similar to Gears of Wars Roadie Run, and melee attacks that allow Hayden to punch or slice nearby enemies. The game has no HUD (except for the ammo counter); Hayden's health is shown by the screen flashing red when he takes damage, as well as an indicator showing the attacker's position. If Hayden takes too much damage, the flash speed will increase, and a heartbeat will be heard, indicating Hayden is \\"bleeding out\\". Money, ammo, weapon upgrades, and grenades can be found in set locations. Downed enemies drop their guns, though after his infection, Hayden can only carry these weapons for a few seconds before they self-destruct. Permanent weapons can be purchased and upgraded in black markets, one small weapon for his off-hand use with the Glaive (replacing the pistol) and one large weapon such as a shotgun or rifle. Multiplayer Dark Sector has an online multiplayer mode, where there are two modes of gameplay: *Infection: one player is randomly selected to be Hayden in a deathmatch against many soldier characters. *Epidemic: two Haydens on separate teams, the objective being to kill the opposing team's Hayden first. In both modes, Hayden will have superior powers compared to the soldiers. Hayden will be able to become invisible, use the Glaive, etc., whereas the soldiers cannot. Story=Setting and characters Dark Sector is set in Lasria, a fictional satellite country bordering the Soviet Union. In the prologue, set near the end of the Cold War, the Lasrians discover an American submarine off the coast. After opening it, a mysterious infection called \\"the Technocyte\\" breaks loose. In the game's present, the Lasrian military fights against the Technocyte victims, who have largely undergone extreme mutations and have gained frightening abilities. The player character is Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum). An ambivalent CIA agent, he has congenital analgesia, which renders him unable to feel pain. He is supported by Yargo Mensik (voiced by J√ºrgen Prochnow), a scientist and sleeper agent who knows the origin of the Technocyte virus. The main antagonist, Robert Mezner (voiced by Dwight Schultz), is an ex-CIA agent who seeks to build a utopia by spreading the Technocyte virus across the planet. Supporting Mezner is Nadia (voiced by Julianne Buescher), a mysterious woman whom Hayden knows; and \\"Nemesis\\", a metallic, humanoid figure who fights with a long Technocyte blade. Other characters include \\"the A.D.\\", Hayden's superior in the CIA; and the Blackmarket Dealer, an arms dealer who supplies Hayden with weapons and equipment for his missions. Plot Dark Sector begins with Hayden Tenno infiltrating a gulag compound in Lasria. Hayden makes short work of enemy resistance to find Robert Mezner, the man responsible for ravaging Lasria with the Technocyte virus. Hayden proceeds with planting C4 charges throughout the building, before encountering a humanoid metal figure called Nemesis. Hayden is knocked unconscious after firing a rocket at Nemesis. Waking up hours later, Hayden finds himself face-to-face with Mezner. As Hayden attempts to reach for his gun, Nemesis appears and stabs his right shoulder, transferring the Technocyte virus into Hayden. Hayden detonates the C4 charges set earlier and manages to escape. His right arm now mutated by Technocyte, Hayden arrives at a radio station to contact the A.D., his superior, for further instructions. The A.D. tells Hayden to meet up with their sleeper agent, Yargo Mensik, to obtain boosters for the infection. Shortly after, Hayden is ambushed by soldiers, just as his infected arm produces the Glaive, which he uses to eliminate the hostiles. Hayden moves along the coast, slowly gaining new abilities with the Glaive as the infection progresses; while encountering both haz-mat soldiers and infected civilians. He also hears Mezner taunting him telepathically, saying that \\"this change is inevitable.\\" Eventually, Hayden finds Yargo, who gives Hayden his updated orders and a booster for the infection. Hayden refuses the medicine, and learns that Mezner wants to recapture the infected with an old transmitter, which emits a signal that attracts Technocyte-infected creatures to its location, within an old church. Hayden also learns that Nadia, a woman Hayden is acquainted with, is also working for Mezner. Hayden moves on towards the church to destroy the transmitter, eliminating both Lasrian soldiers and infected along the way. Eventually, he makes it into the church catacombs and finds the transmitter. Nadia, who has a deep-rooted hatred for Hayden after his last meeting with her, confronts him. She leaves him to fight his way through a swarm of infected and escape before the C4 he set goes off. After making contact with the A.D. again, Hayden learns that Mezner is using a freighter to export the Technocyte virus from Lasria. After getting on the boat and fighting through the crew, he makes it to the cargo hold, accidentally releasing a highly evolved Technocyte monster, which sinks the ship. After Hayden escapes, he learns that Mezner's men have found and captured Yargo. Hayden rushes back to Yargo's post, where he finds a security feed of Nadia torturing Yargo, demanding that he let her into \\"the Vault\\", saying that whatever is in there can control the Technocyte virus. Disobeying the A.D.'s orders to stand down and await his arrival, Hayden sets out to rescue Yargo. Fighting through a train station, Hayden finds Yargo, who has lost an eye during interrogation. After a brief moment of Technocyte-induced pain, Hayden attempts to use the booster, but Yargo starts to warn him about it, just before Nemesis appears. While Yargo escapes, Hayden attempts to take Nemesis head-on, but Mezner arrives and offers Hayden a chance to kill him; however, Mezner has grown powerful enough to mentally control Technocyte creatures, and begins to overpower Hayden. With no other choice, Hayden injects himself with the booster, breaking Mezner's control over him while simultaneously preventing further mutations. Before Hayden passes out, Mezner tells him that he had the same \\"booster\\", which was really meant to prepare the two for the Technocyte virus. Hayden wakes up later in the Vozro Research Facility, where the Technocyte virus was researched during the Cold War. Yargo, who brought him there, tells him that he laced Hayden's booster with \\"enferon\\", a chemical lethal to Technocyte creatures. He claims that he was worried that Hayden would \\"turn out like Mezner\\", as they both had the same strain of the virus; however, Hayden has retained his humanity, while Mezner did not. Yargo also tells Hayden that he can get a suit similar to Nemesis' in the facility's subbasement, which can give him a fighting chance against Nemesis. Hayden sends Yargo through the ventilation system, then makes his way down towards the labs where the suit is kept. After killing hordes of Technocyte creatures and bypassing automated security systems, Hayden discovers the suit; but before he puts it on, Nadia arrives outside the door. Hayden pleads with her to leave before things get worse than they already are. She says she's already in too deep, and that she will take Yargo to open the Vault, before leaving. Hayden dons the suit and slaughters his way through infected and non-infected alike, finally finding and killing Nemesis, learning that it was actually Nadia all along. She apologizes for infecting Hayden and tells him Mezner is planning to transmit the Technocyte virus across Earth. Nadia then tells him that she knows he'll \\"do the right thing this time\\", gives him the key to the Vault, then dies. Hayden works his way to the entrance of the Vault to rendezvous with the A.D., who says he has made a deal with Mezner and gives Hayden a booster \\"for the road\\". Outraged from being used and betrayed, Hayden stabs him in the neck with the booster, telling him that he now feels \\"better than ever\\", and kills all of the A.D.'s men before heading for the Vault. Finding Yargo, Hayden gives him the key, telling him to seal the Vault and dispose of the key. Inside the Vault, a stunned Hayden discovers the first known source of the Technocyte virus: an American submarine that surfaced off the coast of Lasria (seen in the prologue of the game). Hayden discovers Mezner with the Technocyte transmitter, a Hydra-like monstrosity. After fighting and defeating Mezner, the monster and several infected, Yargo arrives to tell Hayden that the transmission is still going out. Hayden tries to fry the circuitry with his Glaive; but Mezner, not yet dead, stuns his right arm, telling him: \\"You are one of us now.\\" With his right hand immobilized, Hayden catches the now-electrified Glaive with his left hand, and impales Mezner's skull with it. With the transmission finally halted, the game ends with Hayden leaving the Vault, catching the Glaive as he steps outside. Yargo, who apparently survives, narrates: \\"That was how it started, the irony of this disease. That in all the others, it made evil; but for him [Hayden], it had saved his soul.\\" Development The development of Dark Sector was announced on February 11, 2000, on Digital Extremes' website. The game was originally proposed as a follow up to Digital Extremes and Epic Games' critically acclaimed multiplayer first-person shooter, Unreal Tournament. However, the original plan was scrapped and the game was not spoken of for another four years, during which the game underwent a massive change in focus. The original design had the game keeping in line with its predecessor as a multiplayer arena-style first-person shooter. An in-game cinematic unveiled years later in 2004, gave viewers a brief look at potential storylines and environments, as well as the graphics of the game. Digital Extremes specifically stated that the clips were not pre-rendered and were actual in-game footage. The game was shown as the first example of what a seventh-generation game would look like. The game was originally intended to take place in a science-fiction environment, in outer space, with players taking the role of a character that inhabits a sleek mechanical suit with incredible powers. The game was officially revealed by Digital Extremes' in late 2005, around the time of the original release of the Xbox 360.Xbox 360 QJ - Dark Sector announced for next- gen consoles In 2006, major overhauls to the game were revealed, showing the main character, and a noticeably less sci-fi setting, although Hayden starts to resemble the originally planned main character as the infection takes over his body. The developers cited a shift in focus by other gaming companies and publishers as the reason for the change to a more modern setting and reducing its sci-fi elements; adding they wanted to achieve the realism that fans would enjoy.Xbox 360 QJ - New Dark Sector Images, less sci-fi, more realistic Another reason was that the tech demo was originally built before the team knew the maximum specifications of the Xbox 360.Xbox 360 QJ - Steve Sinclair on Dark Sector An interview with GameSpot revealed that the change in setting was intended to make the main character stand out more, as well as making the story more relatable, which they say has been written as a superhero origin story. He added: \\"At the beginning of the game when we do the prologue he's just kind of this anti-hero kind of guy. And very simply, concretely in the game, there are certain types of barriers that he has to open with contextual stuff. And then when he changes, then he begins tearing those things off and becomes much more brutal. So what we're trying to do is convey that evolution on the inside, but also convey it on the outside so that those game elements that are around him are evolving as he does.\\" Dark Sector was based on the Sector Engine, later changed to the Evolution Engine, both Digital Extremes' proprietary game engines. Statements about this being just a name change or a major shift in their technology were not released to the public yet. Dark Sector project lead, Steve Sinclair, stated that the engine was written from scratch. The producer of Dark Sector, Dave Kudirka said when they first built the engine, they did not want it to look like the Unreal Engine 3, and they wanted their own perspective engine. When asked about the games' engine being made on the Wii or PC, he replied \\"plausible\\".Xbox 360 QJ - Dark Sector Developer Talk The game went gold on March 7, 2008. The musical score of the game was composed by Keith Power. The Windows version of Dark Sector was initially planned to be released on the same date as on consoles, but later it was dropped and there was no news on its release. On January 19, 2009, some sites reported that a YouTube video showed Dark Sector running on a PC. Later it was confirmed that the game was indeed ported to Windows and was on sale, though only in Russia and the language was Russian by default. Hackers found ways to run the game in English. In early March 2009, Aspyr and Noviy Disk announced the partnership in order to publish Dark Sector for Microsoft Windows, with March 23, 2009 being a targeted release date. Optimized by Noviy Disk for the release, the port featured improved graphics and a redesigned interface that made use of mouse and keyboard controls. An English/French version was added to Steam on March 24, 2009. The PC version's multiplayer mode is only available via Local Area Network play, as the game is a straight port of the console version with no extra code for internet connectivity. Comic A comic titled Dark Sector Zero was released with Dark Sector. Set before the game's main events, it delves into the events that led to Lasria's demise. Reception Dark Sector received mixed to positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 73.24% and 72/100, the PlayStation 3 version 73.14% and 72/100 and the PC version 65.22% and 66/100. Hyper's Dirk Watch commended the game for \\"the Glaive and its aftertouch,\\" but he criticised it for its \\"patchy AI and steep difficulty curve.\\" Greg Howson of The Guardian thought the game was similar to other \\"Gears of War clones\\" except for the Glaive mechanic which was entertaining, however \\"the thrill soon palls, leaving you with a solid yet hardly essential action game.\\" Ban in Australia In February, before the release in March 2008, the game was banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) for sale in Australia. Adam Zweck, the sales and product manager for AFA Interactive, the local distributors of Dark Sector, told GameSpot AU that the game was banned due to its violence, in particular the finishing moves. \\"Obviously we're disappointed in it [the decision]. We feel there is justification for an appeal. However, we're exploring several avenues at the moment to see what we can do to get the game on Australian shelves.\\" It was later re-released in Australia for the PlayStation 3 on October 9, 2008, but the violence was censored. On July 22, 2009, Dark Sector was released on the cover disc of PC Powerplay, an Australian PC gaming magazine, although this was the heavily censored version of the game. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Possible sequel When asked about a sequel in 2008, Steven Sinclair of Digital Extremes stated that there was \\"nothing definitive\\" planned, but commented that he would \\"love to do one\\", and that Dark Sector only scratched the surface of the character and weapon's potential. Digital Extremes eventually developed a free-to-play game, titled Warframe, which borrows heavily from the original Dark Sector concept video and game. The original concept for Dark Sector was more similar to what Warframe is now, but was put in a modern setting with a linear, single-player mode due to the industry landscape at the time. As such, Warframe is considered a spiritual successor, and has a handful of nods to Dark Sector.'

Early life Kadri Gopalnath was born on December 6, 1949 in Sajeepa Mooda village in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada to Taniyappa and Gangamma was greatest of all of them . He acquired a taste for music from his father Taniyappa , a Naadaswara vidwan. As a child, Gopalnath once saw the saxophone being played in the Mysore Palace band set. Upon hearing the vibrant tone of the saxophone, Gopalnath decided to master it. It took him nearly 20 years to conquer the complex western wind instrument, and he was eventually crowned as the \\"Saxophone Chakravarthy\\". Career Gopalnath learnt to play Carnatic music on the saxophone from N. Gopalakrishna Iyer of Kalaniketan, Mangalore. He presented his first concert in the All India Radio, Mangaluru in 1978 . In Madras, Gopalnath came in contact with the vocalist and mridangist guru T.V. Gopalkrishnan, who identified the youngster's potential and tutored him. Gopalnath had to make certain modifications to the conventional alto saxophone to play Carnatic music. So successful was this adaptation that the great musician Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, the doyen of Carnatic music, acknowledged Kadri Gopalnath as a true Carnatic music genius. His maiden live performance was for the Chembai Memorial Trust. The 1980 Bombay Jazz Festival was a turning point for Gopalnath. John Handy, a jazz musician from California was present at the festival. Hearing Gopalnath play, Handy asked if he could go on stage and perform alongside him. So well did the two mesh, Handy in the jazz style and Gopalnath in the Carnatic style, that it became an instant hit with the audience. Gopalnath has participated in the Jazz Festival in Prague, the Berlin Jazz Festival, the International Cervantino Festival in Mexico, the Music Hall Festival in Paris, the BBC Promenade concert in 1994 at London, and has toured all over the world. He cut many albums and recorded a number of cassettes and CDs. Together with jazz flautist James Newton, he recorded Southern Brothers. His production called 'East-West' is an audio-video presentation that, as the title suggests, is a fusion of Western and Indian music. This album took 6 months to produce and has compositions from Saint Tyagaraja, Beethoven and the likes. Film director K. Balachander used Gopalnath's services in his Tamil film Duet. The film had music composed by A.R. Rahman and all the songs had saxophonic instrumentation by Gopalnath, mostly in raga Kalyanavasantam. He once said about this album: : \\"I played some 30 ragas for Rahman. He wasn't satisfied. Finally I played Kalyanavasantam, and he said, \\"Thats it!\\". After that movie I became known. I was in all the papers. It became difficult to travel in buses and trains. Of course I enjoyed the mass appeal.\\" In 2005, Gopalnath began a collaboration with American saxophonist and composer Rudresh Mahanthappa, which resulted in the 2008 album Kinsmen (Pi Recordings) and supporting US tour. Death Gopalnath died on 11 October 2019 due to cardiac arrest at the age of 69 at a private hospital in Mangalore. Awards, titles and tributes Gopalnath was presented with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Carnatic Music - Instrumental (Saxophone), by the President Dr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam, in New Delhi on October 26, 2004. Many titles and honours had come his way, the most cherished being the Asthana Vidwan of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Sri Sringeri Sharadha Peetam, Sri Ahobila Mutt and Sri Pillayarpatti Temple. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004. Gopalnath had the distinction of being the first Carnatic musician to be invited in the BBC Promenade concert in 1994, in the Royal Albert Hall at London. The Asian Music Circuit, U.K, sponsored his recital. Among his other distinctions are: Saxophone Charkravarthy, Saxophone Samrat, Ganakala Shree, Nadapasana Brahma, Sunada Prakashika, Nada Kalarathna, Nada Kalanidhi, Sangeetha Vadya Rathna, Karnataka Kalashree in 1996, Vocational Excellency Award from the Rotary of Madras, Tamil Nadu State Award \\"Kalaimamani\\" and Karnataka Rajyotsava Award in 1998. He received an honorary doctorate from Bangalore University in 2004. The 2008 album Blue Rhizome by the New Quartet features a tribute to the saxophonist called \\"Gopalnath\\" (composed by Karl E. H. Seigfried). He received the Sangeetha Kalasikhamani award for the year 2013 given by The Indian Fine arts Society, Chennai. He received the Kamban Pugazh award for the year 2018 given by All Ceylon Kamban Society, Sri Lanka.

His writing is characterised by \\"an almost neurotic attention to detail\\", epic length (the first volume of Requiem for the Timeless is more than 1,200 pages long) and a curiously ambivalent, sometimes positive/sometimes hostile response from the subjects of his biographies.\\"Angry man in the Van\\" David Sinclair The Guardian 28 May 2005 Retrieved 14 June 2011  Career  Rogan's first publications were in the late 70s with writings on West Coast American music.\\"Zigzag\\" 73: June 1977, Dark Star issues 9‚Äì25, 1977‚Äì1980 Rogan spent his early childhood in the Pimlico area of London.\\"Timeless Flight: The Definitive Biography Of The Byrds\\", p.10 (Square 1 Books, ) His parents emigrated to London from Waterford (Ireland) in 1943. He is a cousin of the actor John Rogan. Rogan's adolescence during the 'Swinging 60s' was vividly captured in the chapter 'The Ghost of Electricity' from his book Timeless Flight Revisited.Timeless Flight Revisited, pp. 11‚Äì22 (Rogan House, ) There was no mention at all of his tragic family history which included his father (fatal heart attack, late 50s), brother (drowned), sister (fatal brain haemorrhage) and mother (emaciation), among other fatalities.'Tragedy' Dublin Evening Press front page, August 1962'Tramore Triple Drowning Tragedy', Munster Express: August 1962 Rogan attended St Vincents, RC, and Pimlico School and spent the entire 70s as a student, obtaining his first degree in English Language & Literature at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, after which he completed an MA at Acadia University in Canada, specialising in Spenser's The Faerie Queene.Oxford Mail, article 'Rogan's Young', August 1982Record Collector issue 221, 'Johnny Rogan Charts His Personal Obsession', p. 68 This was followed by postgraduate study at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.\\"Oxford Originals: An Anthology, ed. by Stacy Marking (Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, 2001; ) His first book Timeless Flight, an acclaimed biography of The Byrds was published when he was still a student at Oxford's Lady Margaret Hall. This work was subsequently rewritten as the 700-page plus volume, Timeless Flight Revisited.Timeless Flight Revisited (Rogan House, 1997, ) The work won considerable acclaim, including biography of the year in Record Collector, in which it was described as \\"One of the best biographies ever written...Expansive enough to rival War And Peace, Johnny Rogan's definitive Byrds biography comes close to matching the emotional, if not geographical, range of Tolstoy's epic novel. One of the achievements of Timeless Flight Revisited is the way in which it matches its narrative flair with the incisiveness of its critical comment... But it's the narrative drive that makes the book so extraordinary. With its detailed research and fascinating interview material, Timeless Flight Revisited is a compelling portrait of collective turmoil, peopled by characters who win our sympathy at the same time as they earn our disbelief.\\"Record Collector: October 1997, January 1998 Similar accolades were forthcoming from Billboard, Time Out and Q Magazine (\\"This is, at least, the best biography of a group ever written\\").Q Magazine, no. 136: March 1998, p. 139 Unusually, the book has been revised extensively in every decade since its original appearance. Rogan went on to write more than 20 other books, mainly in the field of music and popular culture. These included epic biographies of Neil Young (Zero To Sixty) and Van Morrison, plus work on John Lennon, The Kinks, Wham!/George Michael (Virgin Yearbook \\"Book of the Year\\"), Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and The Smiths. Neil Young is quoted praising Rogan's work on the back of the biography along with a five-star review from Uncut and several other prominent music publications. The best-selling Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance attracted considerable attention not least from Morrissey who famously said: \\"Personally I hope Johnny Rogan ends his days very soon in an M3 pile-up.\\"New Musical Express, news pages, April 1992 The comment was made prior to the book's publication and Morrissey claimed he had yet to see a copy of any of its contents. Not long afterwards Morrissey expressed a desire that the author should die in a hotel fire. However, in 1996 Morrissey testified under cross examination that he had not read the book, only \\"bits of it\\". He also testified that comparing some items of witness statements in relation to facts contained in the book that the 'book is correct'; he and Rogan also spoke about various matters at the High Court during a recess.Select Magazine front cover 'Johnny Rogan On The Trials Of Morrissey', March 1997 The Severed Alliance has remained in print without interruption since first publication in 1992 and frequently appears in listings of all-time great music biographies. Rogan continues to write extensively about Morrissey, most recently with 2006's Morrissey: The Albums. Rogan has written two major biographies of Van Morrison and the acknowledgement page of VM: No Surrender states: \\"This book has probably had the longest gestation of any I have written.\\" (20 years). However, this is likely to be eclipsed by Rogan's continuing work on the careers of the Byrds and Neil Young. Morrison on his part is quoted on the 'Dedication Page', saying: \\"Rogan's got something to hide. What's he hiding? I'd like to do a book on him.\\" However, this quote actually emanates from an interview in 1984. No Surrender featured in The Sunday Times Top 10 books of the year and also featured for two consecutive years in hardback and paperback in Mojo's music books of the year. Among the many favourable press notices attached to the paperback edition was an extravagant review concluding: \\"Van Morrison: No Surrender is the best book about popular culture written about any Irishman living or dead, and it's certainly the best social history of Belfast in the mid-60s ever written.\\" Rogan has also written lengthy studies of football management and pop management (Starmakers & Svengalis), the latter of which was adapted for a BBC series. He has also contributed to numerous television documentaries, DVDs and anthologies, including Oxford Originals a collection of writings from authors, including Rogan, who studied at Lady Margaret Hall. Rogan is known for his eccentricity. While working on a book, he once spent one year in isolation without speaking to another human- being.Rogan, Johnny (1993). Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance (Omnibus Press) In December 2011, Byrds: Requiem For The Timeless was published. Time Out's lead review noted: \\"Building on the brick-like Timeless Flight Revisited, Rogan has now collated everything he knows and everything even the staunchest psych-rock aficionado will ever want to know about the group. Rogan's insight is, as ever, razor-keen, and the book is crammed with hilarious anecdotes and brilliant deconstructions of the music. Requiem For The Timeless may yet prove to be one of the key works of rock journalism ‚Äì it's certainly set to be the definitive book on the Byrds.\\" Time Out London 23‚Äì29 February 2012, p. 52 In the summer of 2012, Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance ‚Äì The 20th Anniversary Edition, an expanded and rewritten version of the original was released. Rogan‚Äôs 750-page biography Ray Davies: A Complicated Life was published in March 2015, with a revised paperback following one year later. According to the London Times: ‚ÄúRay Davies is an eccentric, singular artist, but does anyone need to read more than 700 pages on him? Rogan, an obsessive, has form with this kind of thing. This makes for a lot to wade through but Rogan‚Äôs strength is in his dispassionate approach. He‚Äôs not in awe of Davies, nor does he have an axe to grind. Speaking to former wives and managers, band members, brother Dave and [Ray] Davies himself, he gives as definitive a view of the man as anyone could hope for.‚Äù The Times, Saturday review: 28 February 2015, reviewer, Will Hodgkinson In August 2017, Byrds: Requiem For The Timeless, Volume 2 was issued. Both Mojo and Record Collector awarded the book a maximum five stars, the former concluding: ‚ÄúRogan‚Äôs dogged devotion, evocative descriptions and eternal quest for truth behind the myths shines from each of its 1,200 pages to create an essential companion to Volume 1.‚Äù Mojo 286; September 2017, reviewer Kris Needs  Bibliography  *Timeless Flight: The Definitive Biography of The Byrds [1980] (authored as John Rogan) *Neil Young: The Definitive Story Of His Musical Career [1982] *Roxy Music: Style With Substance - Roxy's first ten years [1982] *Van Morrison: A Portrait of the Artist [1984] *The Kinks: The Sound and The Fury [1984] *Wham!

Traditional heating and active cooling systems are absent, or their use is secondary. Low-energy buildings may be viewed as examples of sustainable architecture. Low-energy houses often have active and passive solar building design and components, which reduce the house's energy consumption and minimally impact the resident's lifestyle. Throughout the world, companies and non-profit organizations provide guidelines and issue certifications to guarantee the energy performance of buildings and their processes and materials. Certifications include passive house, BBC - B√¢timent Basse Consommation - Effinergie (France), zero-carbon house (UK), and Minergie (Switzerland).  Background  During the 1970s, experimental initiatives for low-energy buildings were made in Denmark, the United States, Sweden, Canada, and Germany. The German Passivhaus Institute introduced the first passive house in 1990. The implementation of standardized low-energy building concepts has developed differently in each country. Buildings alone are responsible for 38% of all human GHG emissions (20% residential, 18% commercial) as of 2008.U.S. EPA. 2008. Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2006, p. ES8. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), buildings is the sector which presents the most cost effective opportunities for GHG reductions.IPCC. 2007. Climate Change 2007 Synthesis Report, p. 59.  United States  Interest in low-energy buildings has increased in the United States, primarily due to rising energy prices, decreasing costs for onsite renewable-energy systems, and increasing concern about climate change. California requires all new residential construction to be zero net energy by 2020.  Germany  Triggered in the 1970s by the first energy crisis and growing environmental awareness, energy conservation became increasingly important in Germany. In 1977, the country's first energy-related building standard was enacted. The annual heating requirement was introduced as an important parameter by the third German Thermal Insulation Ordinance (1995). In 2013, however, there was no clear legal requirement for a low-energy building standard in Germany. According to Maria Panagiotidou and Robert J. Fuller, definitions, policies and construction activity of zero-energy buildings must be clear. The European Union's Energy Performance Directive requires that beginning in 2021, only low-energy buildings may be built.  United Kingdom  Changes to national policies have occurred since May 2015 in the UK. One of the most significant has been the withdrawal of the Code for Sustainable Homes (CfSH) as a system for assessing and encouraging improvements in the environmental design of dwellings. This has abandoned the code's schematic which provided a framework of achievement levels and to which low-energy designers could aspire to meet or surpass. Although energy- conservation legislation still exists in the building regulations, there is a lack of suitable standards exceeding basic regulations. As a result, the Passive House Standard may expand its influence and impact on energy-efficient houses. National standards The term \\"low-energy houses\\" may refer to national building standards.Raad Z. Homod, (2014) 'Assessment regarding energy saving and decoupling for different AHU (air handling unit) and control strategies in the hot-humid climatic region of Iraq' Energy, 74 (2014) 762-774 These standards sometimes seek to limit the energy used for space heating, which is the largest energy consumer in many climate zones. Other energy uses may also be regulated. The history of passive solar building design provides an international view of one form of low-energy-building development and standards.  Europe  Standards for low-energy buildings in Europe have proceeded differently in each country, and there is no common certification or legislation for low-energy buildings valid in all EU member states. As a movement towards reducing energy use and emissions, a common legislation concerning buildings‚Äô energy performance, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was published in 2002 and became effective in January 2003. =Norway= In NS 3700, the draft official standard, low-energy buildings are defined. About the buildings' energy performance, two alternatives for rating their primary energy use are under discussion: * A limit on a building's annual CO2 emissions, calculated by multiplying the annual supplied energy by a CO2 factor * A percentage of its heating demand must be met with renewable energy. = Denmark = Low-energy houses are defined in the National Building Regulation Building Regulations 08, and are divided into two classes. They are regulated in the regulations' chapter 7.2.4: Low-energy. = Germany= Low-energy houses certified by RAL-GZ 965 have 30 percent less heat losses than regulated in the EnEV, a national building code. Other criteria affect insulation, air tightness and ventilation. Low-energy buildings may be certified by RAL-GZ 965 for planning or construction. = Switzerland = Low-energy buildings may receive the Minergie certification, a \\"quality label for new and refurbished buildings\\". The Minergie standard requires that buildings do not exceed 75 percent of average building energy consumption and fossil-fuel consumption must not exceed 50 percent of the average.  North America  The European Union directive has clarified low- energy houses in Europe, and a large portion of the discussions on zero-energy building in North America derives from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The Energy Star program is the largest certifier of low- energy homes and consumer products in the U.S. Although certified Energy Star homes use at least 15 percent less energy than standard new homes built in accordance with the International Residential Code, they typically achieve a 20- to 30-percent savings.\\"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes.\\" - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008. The United States Department of Energy introduced a program in 2008 to distribute zero-energy housing across thecountry.\\"About Builders Challenge.\\" - March 2008. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy. Retrieved 7 March 2008. Canadian builders may use a range of standards, labels, and certification programs to demonstrate a high level of energy performance in a given project. These include: *Net Zero Home and Net Zero Ready Home certifications, administered by the Canadian Home Builders' Association *Built Green labels, administered by Built Green Canada *Energy Star for Homes, administered by Natural Resources Canada *The Canadian Passive House standard, administered by the Canadian Passive House Institute In British Columbia the above programs align with the BC Energy Step Code, a provincial regulation to incentivize (or require) a level of energy efficiency in new construction beyond the base building code. The code was designed as a technical road map to help the province reach its target of all new net-zero-energy-ready buildings by 2032.  Types  Low-energy houses are broadly defined, but are generally known as houses with a lower energy demand than common buildings regulated by the national building code. The term \\"low-energy house\\" is used in some countries for a specific type of building. A low-energy house is a guideline rarely specified in actual values (heat load or space-heating minimum). A passive house is a standard, with specific recommendations to save heating energy. At one end of the spectrum are buildings with an ultra-low space-heating requirement which require low levels of imported energy (even in winter), approaching an autonomous building. At the opposite end are buildings where few attempts are made to reduce their space-heating requirement and which use high levels of imported energy in winter. Although this may be balanced by high levels of renewable-energy generation throughout the year, it imposes greater demands on the national energy infrastructure during winter.  Obstacles and opportunities  Energy-efficient design often relies on new technologies and techniques. These may create technical obstacles in addition to social, cultural, and economic non-technical obstacles. Despite these obstacles, opportunities exist for skilled, knowledgeable professions to create cost-efficient solutions for energy efficiency in buildings. Buildings designed for good energy efficiency do not always live up to the design goals; various reasons lead to this performance gap. Technology Low-energy building design is considered important to encourage resource efficiency and reduce global climate change associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Design involves two general strategies: minimizing the need for energy use in buildings (especially for heating and cooling) through energy-efficient measures (EEMs) and adopting renewable energy and other technologies (RETs) to meet remaining energy needs. EEMs include building envelopes, internal conditions, and building-services systems; RETs include photovoltaic or building-integrated photovoltaic, wind turbines, solar thermal (solar water heaters), heat pumps, and district heating and cooling. Impacts include life- cycle costs, environmental impacts, and climate-change and social-policy issues. The best low-energy designs offer occupants a better environment and more stable, controlled thermal comfort in addition to reduced energy costs. GHG emissions associated with buildings construction are mainly coming from: # Materials manufacturing (e.g., concrete) # Materials transport # Demolition wastes transport # Demolition wastes treatment The construction, renovation, and deconstruction of a typical building is on average responsible for the emissions of 1,000-1,500 kgCO2e/m2 (around 500 kgCO2e/m2 for construction only). Strategies adopted by low-carbon buildings to reduce GHG emissions during construction include: # Reduce quantity of materials used # Select materials with low emissions factors associated (e.g., recycled materials) # Select materials suppliers as close as possible from the const # Divert demolition wastes to recycling instead of landfills or incineration  Energy efficiency  Reduction of energy consumption is more environmentally and financially advantageous than increasing onsite production to reach a low- energy goal. The less a home consumes, the smaller renewable-energy system it requires to near net zero. Energy efficiency should always be the primary design strategy of a low-energy house.  Improvements  * Absorption refrigerator * Annualized geo solar * Earth cooling tubes * Geothermal heat pump * Heat recovery ventilation * Water heat recycling * Passive cooling * Renewable heat * Seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) * Solar air conditioning * Solar hot water * Solar devices Passive solar design and landscaping Passive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the low-energy house in conservation and can integrate it into a neighborhood and environment. Following passive solar building techniques, where buildings are compact in shape to reduce surface area and principal windows oriented towards the equator (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) maximizes passive solar gain. However, solar gain (especially in temperate climates) is secondary to minimizing the overall house-energy requirements. In hot temperatures, excess heat can create uncomfortable indoor conditions. Passive alternatives to air-conditioning systems, such as temperature-dependent venting, have been shown to be effective in regions with cooling needs.Reda, F., Tuominen, P., Hedman, √Ö., Ibrahim, M.G.E.: \\"Low-energy residential buildings in New Borg El Arab: Simulation and survey based energy assessment\\". Energy and Buildings, Volume 93, 15 April 2015, pp. 65-82. Other techniques to reduce excess solar heat include brise-soleils, trees, attached pergolas with vines, vertical gardens, and green roofs. Although low-energy houses can be constructed from dense or lightweight materials, internal thermal mass is normally incorporated to reduce summer peak temperatures, maintain stable winter temperatures, and prevent possible overheating in spring or autumn before the higher sun angle \\"shades\\" midday wall exposure and window penetration. Exterior wall color (when the surface allows choice) reflection or absorption depends on the predominant year-round outdoor temperature. The use of deciduous trees and wall trellised (or self-attaching) vines can assist in temperate climates. Lighting and electrical appliances To minimize total primary energy consumption, passive and active daylighting are the first daytime solutions to employ. For low-light days, non-daylight spaces and nighttime, sustainable lighting design with low-energy sources (such as standard-voltage compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state lighting with LED lamps, OLEDs and polymer light-emitting diodes and low-voltage incandescent light bulbs, compact metal halide, xenon and halogen lamps) can be used. Solar-powered exterior security and landscape lighting, with solar cells on each fixture or connecting to a central solar panel, are available for gardens and outdoor needs. Low-voltage systems can be used for more controlled (or independent) illumination, using less electricity than conventional fixtures and lamps. Timers, motion detection and daylighting operation sensors further reduce energy consumption and light pollution. Home appliances meeting independent energy-efficiency testing and receiving Ecolabel certification marks for reduced electrical and natural-gas consumption and product-manufacturing carbon emission labels are preferred for low-energy houses. Energy Star and EKOenergy are other certification marks.
