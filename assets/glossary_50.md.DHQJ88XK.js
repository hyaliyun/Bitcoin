In Greek mythology, Megara (; Ancient Greek: ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨œÅŒ±) was a Theban princess and the first wife of the hero Heracles.  Family  Megara was the eldest daughter of Creon, King of Thebes, who was possibly the brother of Jocasta and uncle of Oedipus.Apollodorus, Library, 2.4.11, 2.7.8 If Creon is the same figure, Megara's mother is likely Creon's wife Eurydice, and she would be the sister of Menoeceus (Megareus), Lycomedes, Haemon, and Pyrrha. Accounts of the names and number of Megara and Heracles children vary based on the author.The number of Megara's sons varies according to the source; the Theban tradition made them eight (Ker√©nyi, pp. 185-186, notes Pindar's Fourth Isthmian Ode) but Euripides' Heracles reduced them to three, possibly, according to Ker√©nyi, p. 186, for the exigencies of his stage tradition. According to the mythographer Apollodorus, Megara was the mother of three sons by Heracles named Therimachus, Creontiades, and Deicoon. Dinias the Argive included the three children named by Apollodorus, however, he also added a fourth named Deion.Frazer, note 3 to 2.7.8, which notes that \\"other writers gave different lists\\". Theban poet Pindar states that Megara bore Heracles eight sons. Alternatively, the Roman mythographer Hyginus named their sons as Therimachus and Ophites.Hyginus, Fabulae 31, 32, 72.  Mythology  Heracles kills his son while Megara stands by Megara was married to Heracles by her father as a reward for the hero after he led the defense of Thebes against the Minyans at Orchomenus, and the couple had several sons together.Apollodorus, Library, 2.4.11 Hera sent Heracles into a fit of temporary madness due to her hatred for him. In his madness, Heracles killed their children either by shooting them with arrows or by throwing them into a fire.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 4.11.1Apollodorus, Library, 2.4.12 Whether Megara also died as a result of this attack depended on the author.Euripides, Heracles 1001; Hyginus, Fabulae 31.8, 241. In some sources, after Heracles completed his Twelve Labours, Megara married Heracles' nephew Iolaus and became the mother of Leipephilene by him.Apollodorus, 2.6.1.Plutarch, Moralia \\"The Dialogue on Love / Erotikos / Amatoria\\", Loeb, V. XII, p.339 Heracles' desire to atone for the murders of his wife and children is typically cited as the catalyst for becoming a slave to his cousin Eurystheus and performing the Twelve Labours. Euripides presents an alternative order of events in his tragedy, Heracles, as it was the completion of the twelve labour, retrieving Cerberus from Hades that begun the agon. The play begins with Megara, her children, and Amphitryon as suppliants at an altar seeking refuge from the tyrant Lykos who threatens them as Heracles is in the underworld. Heracles returns to save his family, but Iris and the spirit of madness, Lyssa, cause him to go mad and kill Megara and their children since he believes he is attacking Lykos. Roman playwright Seneca the Younger retells a similar story in his play Hercules Furens. While in the underworld, Odysseus sees Megara, but does not elaborate on her mythology beyond stating she was the daughter of Creon and the former wife of Heracles.Homer, Odyssey, 11.265 The Hellenistic poem Megara by an unknown author presented a dialogue at Tiryns between a mournful Megara and Heracles's mother Alcmene as the former grieves her children and Heracles's absence during his labours.Anonymous, Megara  Cult dedicated to Megara's children  The sons of Heracles appear to have been incorporated into Heracles hero cult at Thebes who were celebrated at a festival known as the Herakleia where a feast was prepared in honour of Heracles above the ‚ÄúElektran Gates‚Äù and sacrifices were made. The hero-tombs of the children of Heracles and Megara in Thebes they were venerated as the Chalkoarai.\\"Those on whom fell a curse of bronze\\" (Ker√©nyi, p. 186).

While playing solitaire (i.e., alone) is possible with any game, it is generally done so as an exercise in analysis rather than for enjoyment. History Commercial solitaire wargames have existed from at least the early 1970s. Operation Olympic was perhaps the earliest and was published in 1974. A solitaire game is a form of puzzle, though the enjoyment of solitaire games are as much in the playing as in the eventual solving of the puzzle. A well designed solitaire game attempts to immerse the player in the subject matter, forcing him to make decisions of the same kind made by his historical counterparts who participated in the actual battles or events being simulated. The best games do this through presenting gameplay options based on reality rather than artificial game restraints. One of the first solitaire board wargames was Iwo Jima, a magazine game by TSR and released in 1983. That same year, Avalon Hill produced B-17, Queen of the Skies, possibly the very first boxed solitaire board wargame. Ambush! is arguably the most successful solitaire board wargame ever made, appearing in 1984 and having spawned three add on games, a companion series of two games, a two-player version, and a similar game focusing on armor in the Second World War. Another solitaire man to man game to appear in 1984 was Ranger by Omega Games, which focused on patrolling missions in a fictional and speculative conflict in Central America. Ambush! appears to have validated the concept of designing specifically for solitaire play, as other very ambitious and innovative titles appeared in its wake. These include: *Mosby's Raiders (Victory Games, 1985) *Eastern Front Solitaire (Omega Games, 1986) *Raid on St. Nazaire (Avalon Hill, 1987) *Tokyo Express (Victory Games, 1988) *Open Fire (Victory Games, 1988) *Solitaire Advanced Squad Leader (Avalon Hill, 1995) Recently, there have been several downloadable titles for solitaire play on wargamedownloads.com, such as Solitaire Caesar, Barbarossa Solitaire and Vietnam Solitaire. Design The key concept in solitaire games is the creation of a simulated opponent. While Iwo Jima relied on the static nature of the Japanese defences to avoid the need for another human player, and B-17 created opposition by the use of simple charts and dice rolls, Ambush! had an innovative set of \\"mission cards\\" that one read in a view sleeve, with entries corresponding to the hexes on the game map. The view sleeve would reveal three digit numbers, corresponding to numbered entries in a book of paragraphs, which would orient the player to the game's situation, activate the simulated opponent, or simply provide atmosphere. The game was heavily action-adventure oriented and had a considerable role playing component. The paragraph booklet also guided the opponent's actions, and each character on the opposing side also had a small card with attributes and a table for selecting paragraphs to guide their actions during gameplay. Ranger was also paragraph driven, but lacked counters and was more abstract (and perhaps realistic) as a result. Combat! by Ross Mortell and Compass Games uses a card based initiative track system to determine the order that enemy units act to simulate a \\"human\\" opponent more realistically. B-17, Queen of the Skies can be looked at as an example of an unsuccessful solitaire board wargame from the point of view of design. The player was presented with no realistic challenges akin to what a historical B-17 pilot would have faced. While the real challenge for a B-17 pilot was the physical task of keeping the aircraft aloft and in formation, these challenges are obviously absent from the game. The navigator and bombardier of a real B-17 had many challenges also, but again, these physical challenges are not simulated at all in the game. The only real decisions to be made are which machineguns to fire at which enemy fighters, and there is often little real decision making even in this. The game is more of an effects simulator, in that a variety of random events and aircraft damage are simulated through the tables and dice rolls, but the player is generally simply a spectator to the events of the game. Tokyo Express, on the other hand, had a well-designed solitaire system. > In TOKYO EXPRESS, the solitaire player represents a U.S. admiral...The game > was designed to make the player experience the suspense, uncertainty and > confusion of command in a night surface action. No \\"hidden\\" paragraphs ae > involved as with so many other solitaire games; the game is replayable again > and again. From Riding the Express: An Introduction to Tokyo Express by > Jonathan Southard, Volume 25, Number 4, The General Magazine. One disadvantage of solitaire games is that the player has few checks and balances on his understanding of the game rules. Given a lack of shared experience with a human opponent who is using and required to understand the same game rules, misinterpretations are more possible. > One of the things I dislike most is to find out that I've been playing a > game incorrectly...It happened to me most recently playing RAID ON ST. > NAZAIRE; I read the rules carefully (I thought) and then went through them > again as I played my first game.

A drawback of solitaire game systems is the balance between immersion and replayability. Ambush! has much more detail in its game system, but also relies heavily on surprise, and hence replayability of individual missions is low. Other games like Tokyo Express or B-17 are infinitely replayable, but because of the dice-driven effects and opponent activation, the game is less immersive and does not sustain the average gamer's interest as long. Legacy Although the number of board war games and publishers have dramatically increased since the wargaming hobby first gained popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, solitaire board wargaming has experienced the opposite trend during the same time period. Few solitaire titles have been released since the 1980s, perhaps a notable exception being Solitaire Advanced Squad Leader in 1995. The simulated opponent in SASL was created through tables and charts in a special chapter of the Advanced Squad Leader Rulebook. Nonetheless, Omega Games has released a new, updated version of Ranger for 2005, along with the two original expansion kits (now merged into one). There has also been a resurgence in Solitaire gaming over the past 10 years. There have been a number of newer games developed that are played only as a solitaire game or have a dedicated portion of the rules to be used in solitaire play. For example, there have been a number of fantasy/sci-fi board games that play very well as one player games, even though they were also designed as multi-player games. These games include Dungeon Quest, Runebound, and Dungeon Twister 2. There has also been a rise in cooperative games that are very playable as solitaire games, such as Pandemic, Arkham Horror and Vanished Planet. The past few years have also seen a resurgence in solitaire war games that have new and innovative systems. These would include games such as Hornet Leader, RAF, Field Commander Rommel, Silent War, Struggle for the Galactic Empire, Where There is Discord, The Hunters: German U-Boats at War, and Ottoman Sunset. This is by no means an exhaustive list. There are many more solitaire games that already exist and still more that are currently in production. This is somewhat surprising, given that such games theoretically should be easier to play on a computer. However, there is no substitute for the feel of the pieces and the view of the map provided in paper and chit games. In addition, the artificial intelligence in computer gaming is often lacking and not as challenging as a solitaire board game. This would should be counter intuitive, but nonetheless, it is often very true.

Company history AEL flag until 1962 American Export Lines (I) Export Steamship Corporation was organized in 1919 and began operating cargo services to the Mediterranean from New York. The word \\"American\\" was added in the 1920s to emphasize its ties to the U.S.. In 1931, they placed in service four cargo- passenger liners, Excalibur, Excambion, Exeter and Exochorda, known as the \\"Four Aces\\". The timing of their new service was unfortunately at the beginning of the Depression. The company went through various reorganisations and became the American Export Lines in 1936. During World War II American Export Lines operated transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.http://www.isthmianlines.com/ships/sm_steel_scientist.htm In 1964, it merged with Isbrandtsen Co. to become the American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines. Isbrandtsen Steamship Company In 1917, Hans Isbrandsen formed a shipping company name Hans Isbrandsen Inc. in Delaware and The Pan American Terminal & Dock Corporation in New York City. The shipping company underwent changes when Hans Isbrandtsen and his cousin A. P. M√∏ller, the shipping magnate who formed the great M√¶rsk Line, began a joint venture in 1919 forming the Isbrandtsen-Moller Company (ISMOLCO) in New York. ISMOLCO grew rapidly when in 1928, a long-term agreement was reached with Ford Motor Corporation, shipping auto parts and general cargo for Japan, China and the Philippines via the Panama Canal. Isbrandtsen founded the Isbrandtsen Steamship Company in 1939 to operate ships in areas where ISMOLCO was not involved. In 1940, this joint venture dramatically transformed due to Permanent Special Instructions One issued by M√∏ller, upon which A. P. M√∏ller's son M√¶rsk Mc-Kinney M√∏ller was made a partner. In 1941, the joint venture ended. M√∏ller and his son went on to found the Interseas Shipping Co., Inc., the predecessor to the Moller Steamship Company, an agent for the M√¶rsk Line in the United States ¬π . While Interseas Shipping Co., Inc., operated mainly in the Atlantic, Isbrandtsen Steamship Company traded mainly in the Far East. Hans's son Jakob took over the company in 1953 upon Hans's passing and bought American Export Lines in 1960. The purchase was approved by the United States Maritime Administration in 1962. Jakob Isbrandtsen merged Isbrandtsen Co. with American Export Lines in 1964 to form American Export & Isbrandtsen Lines, which a year later changed its name to American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines. American Export- Isbrandtsen Lines Jakob Isbrandtsen formed the American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines in 1964 by merging his two shipping companies. Also in 1964, Isbrandtsen, who became a majority stake holder in Ward Industries in 1960, restructured it and in 1967 formed American Export Industries, Inc., a holding company to manage American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines and all support for his fleet operations, including container services, port operations and fleet logistics. In 1971, American Export Industries spun off its holdings and returned to being the American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines. This merger ended in 1973. American Export Lines (II) American Export Lines (AEL), re-emerged after the dissolution of the American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines in 1973. AEL sold their Staten Island Marine Terminal to the City of New York in 1974. After heavy losses and unable to meet crippling debt payments, AEL went into bankruptcy in July 1977, with Farrell Lines buying its port operations in New York City and its remaining ships a year later, including two container ships on order or already under construction at Bath Iron Works, the Argonaut and Resolute, which were delivered directly to Farrell. Farrell Lines was acquired by Royal P&O; Nedlloyd in July 2000, in turn, the Royal P&O; Nedlloyd was acquired by A.P. Moller-Maersk Group in August 2005. The port operations formerly associated with the American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines became part of the Dubai Ports World controversy in February 2006. Passenger shipping services Their first passenger ships were actually combination passenger- cargo ships, known as \\"Four Aces\\", Excalibur, Exeter, Excambion and Exochorda. These ships were ordered built by AEL during the time when the company's president was Henry Herbman, an old-time dockman in NY. They were built by the New York Shipbuilding Company, headed up by Clinton L. Bardo, and first launched in 1931. However, Mr.Herbman was not a good businessman and the ships had not been paid for. J.E. Slater, who was with the consulting firm Coverdale and Colpitts (NYC) was asked to look into their finances, and he quickly found that the business was not being run efficiently. Finally the Maritime Commission removed Herbman from his position and J.E. Slater was asked to run the company for a few years to stabilize it. The company's financial position improved significantly, assisted by a life insurance policy Mr. Herbman had bought himself, which was paid to the company and settled the debt problem. (This information was found in Mr. Slater's taped memoirs which were passed on to his children and grandchildren.) With the exception of the Exochorda, lost during World War II as a result of enemy fire. The latter ship was sold to Turkish Maritime Lines and renamed Tarsus. Following the war, the tonnage was replaced with C-3 class troop transports with the same names. They were given luxury appointments for 125 passengers as well as sufficient cargo-carrying capacity. The crowning achievement in American Export's passenger services were their largest and best-known liners, the and . The vessels were designed in their entirety by Henry Dreyfuss and the names were chosen by a competition. O.J. (Skip) Weber, Mr. Slater's son-in-law entered both names and won the prize. The ship was 'sponsored' at its launching by Mrs. John E. (Pauline) Slater.

Career Dale was born in Addlestone, Surrey in 1938. He took his BA in English at St Peter's College, Oxford, where he studied between 1960‚Äì3. He became Chair of the University Poetry Society succeeding his friend, the American Marshall Scholar, Wallace Kaufman, and made friends during this period with fellow poets Ian HamiltonHis memories of this association were published in the festschrift Another Round at the Pillars, ed. David Harsent, Cargo Press, Cornwall, 1999; it is available online and William Cookson. He soon joined the latter as associate editor and later co-editor of Agenda until 1996. Other friends from that time whose careers intersected with his own were Kevin Crossley-Holland, Yann Lovelock and Grey Gowrie. In 1963 Dale and Kaufman wrote what they intended to be a statement of principles for a new poetry of intelligibility and concreteness. They used the pseudonym Victor Scott Smoley to introduce their essay and what was intended to be a volume of their own poetry. That work was never completed. A teacher until his retirement in 1993, Dale eventually became Head of English at Hinchley Wood School. Besides his many collections of verse, other books include translations of Fran√ßois Villon, Jules Laforgue, Tristan Corbi√®re and Dante, as well as several interviews with other poets and translators. A few of his own poems refer to his classroom experience, but in general he has remarked that \\"I like to work in absolute silence, which is hardly what a classroom has to offer. During invigilations the odd epigram could be managed.\\"Peter Dale in conversation with Cynthia Haven. Waywiser-press.com. Retrieved on 26 August 2011. A selection of such epigrams was eventually published in 2007. Another side of Dale's work was his skill in drawing out a poet in conversation, based not only on a knowledge of his work but the insight available to a fellow practitioner. In 1993, he had interviewed Ian Hamilton for Agenda.\\"Ian Hamilton in Conversation with Peter Dale\\", Agenda 31.2, 1993, pp. 7‚Äì21 Then in 1997 Hamilton proposed the Between the Lines series of in-depth interviews over dinner with Dale and Philip Hoy. These were to be more wide-ranging than the usual interview and of book length.Ian Hamilton website Over the next three years Dale was to interview Michael Hamburger, Anthony Thwaite and Richard Wilbur for this series. In 1963 Dale married Pauline Strouvelle, by whom he had a son and a daughter.International Who's Who of Authors and Writers'. Retrieved on 26 August 2011. After 2008 he moved to live in Cardiff. Poetic style Dale is particularly noted for his skilful use of poetic form, as for example in the sustained use of terza rima in his translation of Dante. His own poems, though usually formal on the surface, employ numerous variations in rhyme, metre and line length, though it is important to remember some of his short, free poems, and to recognise the liberties taken even in his most traditional work, to appreciate his broad range as a poet. He himself has said that \\"a poet shouldn't draw attention to his stylistic self; the poem should be a lens through which something crucial is seen.\\"Peter Dale. Lidiavianu.scriptmania.com. Retrieved on 26 August 2011. Dale's lyric style is intimate whilst avoiding the histrionic pitfalls of the confessional mode. The poems themselves often address another person, but in the main avoid biographical reference. The tension in the poetry is generated by attempts to communicate and frustration that such efforts are never wholly successful, as implied by the title of his sonnet sequence One Another. He takes this demonstration of the clash between dialogue and duologue further in his later sequence Local Habitation in which three points of view are counterpointed through a narrative of changing relationships and moods. Although his poetry has sometimes been described as quiet, Dale has answered that \\"Sentences in their rhythms and juxtapositions may be more passionate than words as words. To give one example, the emotion in \\"A Time to Speak\\" isn't to be found in individual words but in the sentence rhythms, the tension between speech- rhythm and metric, the pauses, the timing and, on this occasion, the images. But the poem won't seem much to anyone with little experience of life.\\" Works Poetry * Nerve (limited edition of 200, 'hand-set and printed in a hurry') 1959.This was produced for sale at The Visceral Image group exhibition held in the Woodstock Gallery, London, between 20 July ‚Äì 15 August 1959.

Emmett Par√© (January 24, 1907 ‚Äì October 1973), was an American tennis player in the early part of the 20th century and a coach at Tulane University who played his college tennis at Georgetown University, and was one of the early stars of professional tennis. Par√© was a captain on the Georgetown University tennis team, and in 1928 he reached the doubles final in the NCAA Championships. He graduated from Georgetown in 1929. In 1928, he won the singles title at the Tri-State Tennis Tournament (nowadays known as the Cincinnati Master) and reached the singles final again in Cincinnati in 1930. He also won the Western Tennis Championships in 1928; also the Western Indoor Championships and the Michigan State title in 1927. In 1929, he won the U.S. National Clay Court Championship singles title after a five-set victory in the final against J. Gilbert Hall. Around 1931, he became a touring professional; he traveled with the legendary Bill Tilden in his first barnstorming tour in 1931. However, by 1933, Par√© had settled in as the head pro at the New Orleans Tennis Club; in the same year he started as tennis coach at Tulane University. He was ineligible to play in the top amateur events. In 1934 he won the doubles title at the U. S. Pro Tennis Championships with Bruce Barnes. From 1934 to 1973, he was the head tennis coach at Tulane University. For 40 years, until his retirement in 1973, Par√©'s Green Wave squads were a national powerhouse and the scourge of the Old Southeastern Conference. His teams won 20 Southeastern Conference team titles and in 1959 his Green Wave team tied the University of Notre Dame for the NCAA team title. Six of his Tulane players won NCAA singles championships. From 1938 until Tulane left the SEC in 1966, the Green Wave won 18 conference championships, including nine straight from 1951 until 1959. That year was also monumental in another respect for Tulane, as Par√©'s squad captured the school's only team national championship, winning the 1959 NCAA title. That championship followed NCAA runner-up appearances in 1949 and 1957. Tulane boasts eight individual NCAA singles champions and two NCAA doubles winners. Clifford Sutter won Tulane's first national championship, claiming the NCAA singles title in both 1930 and 1932. Following Par√©'s arrival in 1933, the Green Wave added another six singles titles to its trophy case, including an impressive three straight in 1953,54,and 55. Ernest Sutter won back-to-back NCAA titles in 1936 and 1937, while Jack Tuero claimed the 1949 singles crown. Hamilton Richardson began a three-year run of Tulane singles championships in 1953, repeating as champion again in 1954. In 1955, Jose Aguero claimed the NCAA singles title, Tulane's eighth in a span of 25 years. However, the winning continued into the late 1950s, as Crawford Henry and Ron Holmberg teamed to give Tulane the NCAA doubles champions in 1957 and 1959. Richardson and Aguero led perhaps the strongest of Tulane tennis teams from 1952 through 1955. Richardson led the squad from the No. 1 position, while Aguero was perhaps the nation's most formidable No. 2 singles player after joining the team in 1954. Richardson nearly added a third singles championship in 1955, but the NCAA ruled him ineligible due to his participation on the Tulane varsity as a freshman, pushing Aguero center stage, where the Brazilian won the singles championship in his own right that season. The 1957 Green Wave squad may have matched the 1954-55 Richardson-Aguero squads in overall strength. The team had an incredible 1-2-3 punch with Aguero as a senior and super sophomores Holmberg and Henry at the No. 2 and 3 positions, respectively. The 1957 team earned the Greenies their second NCAA runner-up honor to the University of Michigan, although the Henry-Holmberg duo captured Tulane's first NCAA doubles title that season. Henry and Holmberg also led a strong 1959 squad, as Tulane won the first NCAA Championship in school history. The duo again captured the NCAA doubles crown that season, giving Tulane its eighth individual national championship under Par√©. Par√©'s teams dominated not just the national tennis scene, but also the Southeastern Conference as well. In 1939, the Green Wave won the first of 18 SEC titles, claiming back-to-back championships again in 1941 and 1942. After Georgia Tech won the first post-war SEC championship in 1946, Tulane reasserted itself in 1947, winning three straight which would begin a run of 15 league titles in an 18-year span. Florida briefly halted the rolling Wave by capturing the 1950 SEC crown, but Tulane responded by winning nine straight titles from 1951 through 1959. Georgia Tech and Florida won the SEC in 1960 and 1961, respectively, but the Greenies closed out their stay in the SEC with titles in 1962,63, and 64. Tulane's 1950?s squads not only won the SEC nine out of 10 seasons, but made a habit of claiming a majority of the nine championship matches each season at the league tournament. In 1953, Green Wave players won all six singles titles and all three doubles matches. A year later, Tulane claimed the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 5 singles matches and all three doubles positions. In 1955, Tulane claimed five singles titles (all but No. 6) and again swept the three doubles spots. The great 1957 squad won five singles championships and two of the three doubles matches. He was enshrined in the Athletic Hall of Fame at both Tulane University and Georgetown University and in the Sugar Bowl Hall of Fame.

It does not encompass phone tapping or call recording. Collecting data  Telephone call data, such as originating station, destination, start and ending times, and transmission characteristics, is collected from a telecommunications system or private branch exchange (PBX) in form of call detail records (CDRs). The equipment typically presents this data on older PBXs via a serial communications port, or more recently via a computer network over an Ethernet connection. From the interface, CDRs are collected on computer systems running call logging and analysis software. Some PBX manufacturers provide their own basic call logging software but many other third-party software packages are available. Call logging software The goal of the call logging software is to interpret the raw CDR data and produce graphical and summarizing reports. Call logging software packages differ in the sizes of PBX systems that they can support, from hundreds of extensions to hundreds of thousands of extensions. They also differ in the capability of logging specific types of events or data and support for specialized PBX features. In general terms, call logging reports can highlight such areas as: *Cost Control ‚Äì cost of calls, cost of trunk lines, costs by department or individual extension, number of unused extensions, etc. Call logging software can also discover instances of Telephone fraud. *Performance Management ‚Äì looks at how long it is taking an organization to answer phone calls by operator, department or extension and demonstrates whether they meet acceptable target levels for that organization. *Capacity Management ‚Äì judges whether the system is being over or under utilized. It examines trunk usage and call patterns that show where extra capacity is required or where cost savings can be achieved. *QoS Reporting ‚Äì modern VoIP PBXs are able to output quality of service data in addition to standard CDRs. An up-to-date call logging package should be able to include this data along with its other reports to help monitor and improve system performance. History=United Kingdom During the 1970s, Post Office Telecommunications was embarking on upgrading the telephone network, with the view to modernizing the various established mechanical switching devices, consisting mostly of Strowger exchanges, employed in the UK telephone exchanges, and replacing them with an electronic system. This replacement system became known as System X. Concurrently, and as part of this network upgrade, a dedicated engineering group was formed within the division THQ (Telecoms) to design a call logging system and to establish its feasibility for integration within the various existing Strowger and electronic exchanges, prior to their eventual replacement. A mix of different telephone exchange equipment was selected for trial within Scotland, comprising Strowger pre-2000, 2000 and 4000 type switches located in Director telephone systems and non-Director areas. The call logging trial proved successful and while it was initially designed to gather phone call data and cost of billing details specific to the customers' call's, a hidden benefit emerged such that local management were also able to see a pattern of the types of calls being generated, i.e. calls to and from certain businesses in addition to billing information, which was used to ease flow of traffic during peak times in the exchange and to plan for future customer provision within a catchment area. The concept of this call logging equipment was also deployed in UXD exchanges for remote areas where a System X exchange was not considered feasible.

Essential parameters  The essential parameters of any moving image sequence as a visual presentation are: presence or absence of colour, aspect ratio, resolution and image change rate.  Image change rate  There are several standard image-change rates (or frame rates) used today: 24 Hz, 25 Hz, 30 Hz, 50 Hz, and 60 Hz. Technical details related to the backward-compatible addition of color to the NTSC signal caused other variants to appear: 24000/1001 Hz, 30000/1001 Hz, and 60000/1001 Hz. The image change rate fundamentally affects how \\"fluid\\" the motion it captures will look on the screen. Moving image material, based on this, is sometimes divided into two groups: film-based material, where the image of the scene is captured by camera 24 times a second (24 Hz), and video-based material, where the image is captured roughly 50 or 60 times a second. The roughly 50 and 60 Hz material captures motion very well, and it looks very fluid on the screen. In principle, the 24 Hz material conveys motion satisfactorily; but, because it is usually displayed at least twice the capture rate in cinema and on CRT TV (to avoid flicker), it is not considered capable of transmitting \\"fluid\\" motion. Nevertheless, it still is used to film movies, because of the unique artistic impression arising exactly from the slow image-change rate. 25 Hz material, for all practical purposes, looks and feels the same as 24 Hz material. 30 Hz material is in the middle, between 24 and 50 Hz material, in terms of \\"fluidity\\" of the motion it captures; but, in TV systems, it is handled similarly to 24 Hz material (i.e. displayed at least twice the capture rate).  Capture  The capture process fixes the \\"natural\\" frame rate of the image sequence. Moving image sequence can be captured at the rate which is different from presentation rate, however this is usually only done for the sake of artistic effect, or for studying fast-pace or slow processes. In order to faithfully reproduce familiar movements of persons, animals, or natural processes, and to faithfully reproduce accompanying sound, the capture rate must be equal to, or at least very close to the presentation rate. All modern moving image capture systems either use a mechanical or an electronic shutter. Shutter allows the image for a single frame to be integrated over a shorter period of time than the image change period. Another important function of the shutter in raster-based systems is to make sure that the part of frame scanned first (e.g. the topmost part) contains image of the scene integrated over exactly the same period of time as the part of frame scanned last. Early TV cameras, such as the video camera tube, did not have a shutter. Not using shutter in raster systems may alter the shape of the moving objects on the screen. On the other hand, the video from such a camera looks shockingly \\"live\\" when displayed on a CRT display in its native format.  Transmission  Analog broadcasting systems‚ÄîPAL/SECAM and NTSC‚Äîwere historically limited in the set of moving image formats they could transmit and present. PAL/SECAM can transmit 25 Hz and 50 Hz material, and NTSC can only transmit 30 Hz and 60 Hz material (later replaced by 30/1.001 and 60/1.001 Hz). Both systems were also limited to an aspect ratio of 4:3 and fixed resolution (limited by the available bandwidth). While the wider aspect ratios were relatively straightforward to adapt to 4:3 frame (for instance by letterboxing), the frame rate conversion is not straightforward, and in many cases degrades the \\"fluidity\\" of motion, or quality of individual frames (especially when either the source or the target of the frame rate conversion is interlaced or inter- frame mixing is involved in the rate conversion).  50 Hz television systems  Material for local TV markets is usually captured at 25 Hz or 50 Hz. Many broadcasters have film archives of 24 frame/s (film speed) content related to news gathering or television production. Live broadcasts (news, sports, important events) are usually captured at 50 Hz. Using 25 Hz (de-interlacing essentially) for live broadcasts makes them look like they are taken from an archive, so the practice is usually avoided unless there is a motion processor in the transmission chain. Usually 24 Hz material from film is usually sped up by 4%, when it is of feature film origin. The sound is also raised in pitch slightly as a result of the 4% speedup but pitch correction circuits are typically used. * Older technology allows an alternative option where every 12th film frame is held for three video fields instead of two mostly fixing the problem. * More modern film playback technology allows for every 25th frame to be interpolated, with less objectionable results and no need for pitch modification. * Each of these film oriented content transmission techniques has its own drawbacks. However modern motion compensation processors are considered to produce the least objectionable output. With roughly 30 or 60 Hz material, imported from 60 Hz systems, is usually adapted for presentation at 50 Hz by adding duplicate frames or dropping excessive frames, sometimes also involving intermixing consecutive frames. Nowadays, digital motion analysis, although complex and expensive, can produce a superior-looking conversion (though not absolutely perfect).  60 Hz television systems  Because of higher television production budgets in the US, and a preference for the look of film, many prerecorded TV shows were, in fact, captured onto film at 24 Hz. Source material filmed at 24 Hz is converted to roughly 60 Hz using the technique called 3:2 pulldown, which includes inserting variable number of duplicate frames, with additional slowdown by the factor of 1.001, if needed. Occasionally, inter-frame mixing is used to smooth the judder. Live programs are captured at roughly 60 Hz. In the last 15 years, 30 Hz has also become a feasible capture rate when a more \\"film like\\" look is desired, but ordinary video cameras are used. Capture on video at the film rate of 24 Hz is an even more recent development, and mostly accompanies HDTV production. Unlike 30 Hz capture, 24 Hz cannot be simulated in post production. The camera must be natively capable of capturing at 24 Hz during recording. Because the ~30 Hz material is more \\"fluid\\" than 24 Hz material, the choice between ~30 and ~60 rate is not as obvious as that between 25 Hz and 50 Hz. When printing 60 Hz video to film, it has always been necessary to convert it to 24 Hz using the reverse 3:2 pulldown. The look of the finished product can resemble that of film, however it is not as smooth, (particularly if the result is returned to video) and a badly done deinterlacing causes image to noticeably shake in vertical direction and lose detail. References to \\"60 Hz\\" and \\"30 Hz\\" in this context are shorthand, and always refer to the 59.94 Hz or 60 x 1000/1001 rate. Only black and white video and certain HDTV prototypes ever ran at true 60.000 Hz. The US HDTV standard supports both true 60 Hz and 59.94 Hz; the latter is almost always used for better compatibility with NTSC. 25 or 50 Hz material, imported from 50 Hz systems, can be adapted to 60 Hz similarly, by dropping or adding frames and intermixing consecutive frames. The best quality for 50 Hz material is provided by digital motion analysis.  Modern digital systems  Digital video is free of many of the limitations of analog transmission formats and presentation mechanisms (e.g. CRT display) because it decouples the behavior of the capture process from the presentation process. As a result, digital video provides the means to capture, convey and present moving images in their original format, as intended by directors (see article about purists), regardless of variations in video standards. Frame grabbers that employ MPEG or other compression formats are able to encode moving image sequences in their original aspect ratios, resolution and frame capture rates (24/1.001, 24, 25, 30/1.001, 30, 50, 60/1.001, 60 Hz). MPEG‚Äîand other compressed video formats that employ motion analysis‚Äîhelp to mitigate the incompatibilities among the various video formats used around the world. At the receiving end, a digital display is free to independently present the image sequence at a multiple of its capture rate, thus reducing visible flicker. Most modern displays are \\"multisync,\\" meaning that they can refresh the image display at a rate most suitable for the image sequence being presented. For example, a multisync display may support a range of vertical refresh rates from 50 to 72 Hz, or from 96 to 120 Hz, so that it can display all standard capture rates by means of an integer rate conversion.  Presentation  There are two kinds of displays on the market today: those which \\"flash\\" a picture for a short part of the refresh period (CRT, cinema projector), and those which display an essentially static image between the moments of refreshing it (LCD, DLP). The \\"flashing\\" displays must be driven at least 48 Hz, although today, a rate significantly below 85 Hz is not considered ergonomic. For these displays, the 24‚Äì30 Hz material is usually displayed at 2x, 3x, or 4x the capture rate. 50 and ~60 Hz material is usually displayed at its native rate, where it delivers a very accurate motion without any smearing. It can also be displayed at twice the capture rate, although moving objects will look smeared or trailed, unless intermediate frames are calculated using the motion analysis and are not just simply duplicated. The \\"continuous\\" display can be driven at any integer multiple of the capture rate - it won't matter for the viewer, nor can it be visually discriminated. However, in general, \\"continuous\\" displays show noticeable smear over quickly-moving objects in 50 and ~60 Hz video material (even if their response time is instant). However, there are two emerging techniques to combat smearing of the video-based material in LCD display: it can be effectively converted into the \\"flashing\\" display by appropriately modulating its backlight; and/or it can be driven at double the capture rate while calculating intermediate frames using the motion analysis (see LCD television). Obviously, when presentation rate is not an integer multiple of the capture rate, the \\"fluidity\\" of the motion on the screen will suffer to a varying degree (terribly for video-, unpleasantly for film-based material). This is usually the case with computer-based DVD players and PAL PC TVs, where the user does not switch the refresh rate either out of ignorance, or due to technical constraints; which sometimes are, in fact, artificial, made by manufacturers counting on that user's ignorance. For instance some laptop LCD panels cannot be (easily) switched to anything but a 60 Hz refresh rate, and some LCD displays with DVI input refuse to accept digital input signal if its vertical refresh rate does not fit between 58 and 62 Hz. Most software DVD players do not assist with switching display modes, and even if it is switched manually, they hardly synchronize frame updating with the display's vertical retrace periods. (There is only soft synchronization using hardware double buffering, which is not enough to match hardware players in the stability of playback.)  50 vs. 60 Hz  60 Hz material captures motion a bit more \\"smoother\\" than 50 Hz material. The drawback is that it takes approximately 1/5 more bandwidth to transmit, if all other parameters of the image (resolution, aspect ratio) are equal. \\"Approximately\\", because interframe compression techniques, such as MPEG, are a bit more efficient with higher frame rates, because the consecutive frames also become a bit more similar. There are, however, technical and political obstacles for adopting a single worldwide video format. The most important technical problem is that quite often the lighting of the scene is achieved with lamps which flicker at a rate related to the local mains frequency. For instance the mercury lighting used in stadia (twice the mains frequency). Capturing video under such conditions must be done at a matching rate, or the colours will flicker badly on the screen. Even an AC incandescent light may be a problem for a camera if it is underpowered or near the end of its useful life. The necessity to select a single universal video format (for the sake of the global material interchange) should anyway become irrelevant in the digital age. The director of video production would then be free to select the most appropriate format for the job, and a video camera would become a global instrument (currently the market is very fragmented).

As of 2011, the city has a population of 9,567 inhabitants. Surrounded by hills to its west and mountains to its east (notably Mount Hajla), it is the source of the river Ibar, which gives its name to the local sports clubs FK Ibar, KK Ibar and OK Ibar. Ro≈æaje is the centre of the Ro≈æaje Municipality within the 24 municipalities of Montenegro. History Ro≈æaje was first settled in antiquity by Illyrians. Later, during the migration of the Slavs, Slavs settled in the area. Ro≈æaje was first mentioned in 1571 and 1585. The settlement surrounding the then fort was called Trgovi≈°te, which it was called until 1912. In 1797 the Ganiƒá kula, a defensive tower (much like the same towers build within the Caucasus region between Russia and Georgia), built from the Muslim side of the Kuƒçi (Muslim members of the clan), as they supported Muslim authority and culture, was built. Nowadays, the tower is currently the town's museum. During the Ottoman Empire's reign over Montenegro, the Sultan Murat II Mosque was constructed in the city in the 1500s, which also contains the turbe of the sultan's body. During World War I, the army of the Kingdom of Montenegro captured the city in 1912 from the Ottoman Empire, during the First Balkan War. It was officially ceded to Montenegro following the Treaty of London in 1913 that ended the war. After the war, Ro≈æaje was one of the main cities that participated in the Plav rebellion (Plavska pobuna) of 1919, which fought against the inclusion of Sandzak in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. An estimated 700 Albanians were killed in Ro≈æaje when the rebellion was quelled. During World War II, the city has seen conflict between the Yugoslav Partisans, the Chetniks, the Sandzak Muslim Militia, and the Albanian Vulnetari. Mullah Jakup Kardoviƒá, who would end up being a prominent commander of the Militia and would participate in the Battle for Novi Pazar, came from the village of Bi≈°evo, which is 4-5km away from the city. In 1992, during the Yugoslav Wars, the Bosniaks of Foƒça who managed to escape the massacre that happened in the town were resettled in Ro≈æaje.Human Rights Watch, 2006-Genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity: a topical digest of the case law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia In 2018, a replica of the Sebilj in Sarajevo has been completed and is currently displayed in the town's main square. Ro≈æaje annually celebrates its foundation day on September 30th. Population and demographics Ro≈æaje is the administrative centre of the Ro≈æaje municipality, which has a total of 23,312 residents. The town of Ro≈æaje itself has a population of 9,567 in 2011. Ro≈æaje is also considered to be the centre for the Bosniak community of Montenegro. Bosniaks form the majority in both the town and the municipality itself. Ethnic Albanians have been present within the city, as well as the outskirts, especially villages that are close to the border of Kosovo. They enjoy and support mutual relations with the Bosniaks and other ethnicities within the city and have also became an integral part of Ro≈æaje's society. The current population of Albanians living in Ro≈æaje rounds up to 1,158, forming 5% of the total population in 2011. The population of Ro≈æaje from 1981 (as SR Montenegro) to 2011 (as the current republic) is as shown below: *March 3, 1981 ‚Äì 7,336 *March 3, 1991 ‚Äì 8,828 *November 1, 2003 (as SCG) ‚Äì 9,121 *July 1, 2011 ‚Äì 9,567 Transport Ro≈æaje is situated on the main road connecting Montenegro with Kosovo, known as the Ro≈æaje-Kula-Peƒá road (Kula being the border post between Montenegro and Kosovo on both sides). It also has a link with Novi Pazar in Central Serbia. The IB-22 Highway (otherwise known as the Ibarska magistrala) is the main regional road that connects Montenegro with Serbia. It is also connected to the rest of Montenegro by a two-laned highway via Berane, which is some in distance. The nearest airport is the Pristina International Airport in Pristina, Kosovo which is away, compared to Podgorica Airport which is about away, and has regular flights to major European destinations annually.

The line was created by Surveyor-General George Keith in 1686, when he ran the first survey to mark out the border between West Jersey and East Jersey. The Keith line was intended to clarify disputes resulting from the 1676 Quintipartite Deed, which created the two territories. The Keith Line runs North-Northwest from the southern part of Little Egg Harbor Township, passing just north of Tuckerton. The line was to continue upward to a point on the Delaware River which is just north of the Delaware Water Gap, but Keith was stopped in his survey by Governor of West Jersey Daniel Coxe, when Keith had reached the South Branch of the Raritan River in what is now Three Bridges in Readington Township.\\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968\\", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 9. To finish the border, Coxe and his East Jersey counterpart, Governor Robert Barclay met in London to set a compromise boundary called the Coxe-Barclay Line. More accurate surveys and maps were made to further resolve property disputes. This resulted in the Thornton Line, drawn around 1696, and the Lawrence Line, drawn around 1743, which was adopted as the final line for legal purposes. Today the Keith Line is still visible and can be seen via a map of New Jersey's municipalities. In contemporary culture, the Keith Line has been cited as marking the approximate boundary between spheres of influence for New York City sports teams and Philadelphia sports teams; especially in the rivalry between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles.

Martins agreed to its acquisition by the Bank of Liverpool in 1918. The Bank of Liverpool wanted Martins to give it a London presence and a seat on the London Clearing House; the Martins name was retained in the title of the enlarged bank which was known as The Bank of Liverpool and Martin's Limited. The title was shortened to Martins Bank Limited (without an apostrophe) in 1928 at the insistence of the directors of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Bank when it was bought by the Bank of Liverpool and Martins. The Head Office and managerial control remained firmly in Liverpool, cementing Martins' place as the only English national bank to have its Head Office outside London. History The sign under which the Bank traded was that of a grasshopper. The history of Martins Bank is intertwined with the Grasshopper, the sign under which the Bank traded and was known in its early years. Tradition has it that Thomas Gresham, whose family crest included a grasshopper,Why Is There A Giant Grasshopper On The Royal Exchange? The Londonist; retrieved 15 September 2019 founded the bank in 1563. However, although he is believed to be the first to use the sign of the Grasshopper on a goldsmiths shop in Lombard Street he does not appear to have had any connection with the Martins. Chandler states that there are differences of opinion as to when the Grasshopper became a bank and John Martin did not purchase the freehold of the Grasshopper until 1741. The Martin family were among the early London Goldsmiths. In 1558 Richard Martin was elected a liveryman of the Goldsmiths Company and later a Master of the Mint and Lord Mayor of the City of London. Successive generations of Martins ran the bank that was popularly referred to as ‚ÄúThe Grasshopper‚Äù but the partnership went through various incarnations, including Martins, Stone and Blackwell, and Martin Stone and Foote in the eighteenth century; and Martin and Company in 1844. The London private bankers typically confined themselves to their one office, although Martins did have the occasional branch where individual partners lived. It meant that, compared with the joint stock banks, Martins' growth was limited. Following the panic that followed the collapse of Barings Bank in 1890, Martins finally decided to become a limited company (1891). This prompted a more expansionist approach but the bank ‚Äúthought only of amalgamations with other private banks‚Äù. There was an unsuccessful approach to Cocks Biddulph, with which there were family links, but the realisation that ‚Äúexpansion to the provinces was now essential‚Äù led to the bank agreeing, in 1914, to its acquisition by the Bank of Liverpool, which had been founded in 1831 in Liverpool, England. The Martins name had valuable prestige and a seat on the London Clearing House; when the delayed ‚Äúmerger‚Äù was consummated in 1918 after the conclusion of the First World War, the family name was retained in the title Bank of Liverpool and Martins. The name was subsequently shortened to Martins Bank Limited in 1928. The change of name was at the insistence of the directors of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Bank, whose former HQ at 43 Spring Gardens Manchester became Martins' Manchester district office. By 1928, the bank had expanded to some 560 branches and had a logo featuring a grasshopper, which was the crest of Sir Thomas Gresham, and a Liver Bird, the logo of the Bank of Liverpool. The combined coat of arms was duly registered by the College of Heralds. The heraldic description of the coat of arms is as follows: \\"Or, a Liver Bird (or Cormorant) Sable, holding in the beak a branch of Laver (or Seaweed) Vert, on a Chief of the third a Grasshopper of the first.\\" Directors of Martins Bank included Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby, The Queen Mother's younger brother The Hon. Sir David Bowes-Lyon and Colonel Robert Buxton DSO MA-Oxon (Imperial Camel Corps friend of T.E. Lawrence). Between 1958 and 1967 Martins Bank owned and operated Lewis's Bank which had branches in each of the Lewis's Department Stores (not to be confused with John Lewis) and also in Selfridges in London. Lewis's Bank was sold to Lloyds Bank in 1967 and lasted until at least the 1980s. The last Lewis's department store (in Liverpool) closed in May 2010. A new headquarters building for Martins Bank Limited was designed by the architect Herbert James Rowse in the classical revival style and opened in 1932 at 4 Water Street, Liverpool, replacing the previous headquarters at 7 Water Street. Martins Bank Building, Liverpool. The bank was bought by Barclays Bank in 1969, when all of its 700 branches became branches of Barclays. Around 30 branches closed immediately, and 10 were downgraded to sub-branches. Some, such as the sub-branch at Eaton, Norwich, Norfolk were brand new and handed over to Barclays on the day appointed by Act of Parliament for the merger of the two banks, 15 December 1969. The Martins grasshopper logo was retained for part of the combined business until the early 1980s, with \\"Martins Branch\\" and a small grasshopper appearing first on both statements and cheque books, later cheques only (see the Martins Bank Archive Project link below). Martins numbered among its customers a football pools company, a major airline and a world-renowned shipping line. When these customers wanted to borrow large sums, Martins was known to have borrowed from other banks on a number of occasions to fulfil these requests. Even so, many who worked for the bank believed that Martins could have survived on its own, as at the time of takeover it was expanding its UK banking operation, and continuing a run of \\"firsts\\" which included: *First in the north of England with a cash machine, in 1967 at 84 Church Street, Liverpool *First with mobile branches to provide banking to remote areas *First with a drive-through bank, in Leicester in 1959 and Epsom in 1966 *First and only English bank to have a Head Office outside London *First to recognise and embrace the swinging 60's in its advertising *First to experiment with and then use a computer to operate current-account business *First with a branch on the centre court at Wimbledon Women were contractually obliged to leave the bank upon marriage, and as late as 1965, men were not allowed to get married until their salary reached a prescribed level. Many of Martins' forms, and some procedures, were retained or later adopted by Barclays as being more advanced than their own. Martins Bank Archive Martins Bank Archive has been collecting images and items relating to Martins Bank since 1989. Since 2009 the collection has been accessible online, with interested parties emailing requests for (or donations of) information or images, via the archive website. Since 2011 Martins Bank Archive has carried the newsletter of the Grasshopper Pensioners' Club, a group of former Martins Staff whose activities are funded partly through subscription, and partly by Barclays. The site is run in association with, but independently of Barclays, who provide several thousand images of the Bank's branches as they were between the 1930s and 1969. At 24 June 2013 the Archive website comprises 1116 pages of information and images relating to more than 900 known branches and former branches of Martins Bank. The Archive has pieced together a staff database of more than 100,000 entries, from existing paper records, and can provide limited information to family tree researchers. Career details are available dating back to the late 1800s for some staff, but in the main the records cover the period 1946 to 1969. The database also covers New Entrants, Staff Transfers and Promotions, Marriages, Retirements and Deaths. Martins Bank Archive is also home to a separate archive for Lewis's Bank, covering the period 1958 to 1967. A staff database for this period is also maintained.

Mr Mainwaring's Bank was always meant to be Martins, but in the early episodes of the TV series the BBC felt a different name would \\"avoid confusion\\". In an episode of the second series Mr Mainwaring can actually be heard telling Private Walker that \\"as the Manager of Martins Bank\\" he wants nothing to do with black market activities. It was also used as the bank in \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\" (2016) Martins Bank worked in association with the Kiddicraft Toy Company and Metcalfe Models to provide toys with the Bank's logo on them. These included miniature cheque and paying in books, and cardboard construction kits for model railway enthusiasts. In 1968, whilst already part of the Barclays Group of Companies, Martins issued what became a commemorative grasshopper money box in clear yellow plastic. this was given to children who opened savings accounts, along with a gilt brooch.

Tennis career Between 1928 and 1945 he was ranked eight times in the U.S. Top Ten, reaching No. 1 in 1933, and No. 2 in 1930. He was ranked World No. 5 in 1930 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph. Shields beat Wilmer Allison and Sidney Wood before losing to John Doeg in the final of the 1930 U. S. championships. Shields defaulted to Sidney Wood in the singles final of Wimbledon in 1931 due to an ankle injury he had sustained in winning his semi-final match against France's \\"Musketeer\\" Jean Borotra, and this was the only time in the history of a Grand Slam event singles final that the event was won by default. Davis Cup He competed for the Davis Cup in 1931, 1932, and 1934, winning 19 of 25 matches. He was left off the team for his erratic playing in 1933. Shields was the non-playing captain in 1951, when the team won four matches. Shields had his issues both with interactions with other players, and with alcohol. In the late 1930s, Shields was known for making fun of the US tennis star Bryan Grant, the smallest American to win an international championship, saying \\"the little shaver\\" was hiding behind the net. Once a drunk Shields held Grant upside down, outside a hotel window.

He was born and worked in Chicago, Illinois. He is perhaps, the earliest novelist from Chicago to gain a national reputation. His exploration of city life was seen as revelatory, and later in his life he was perhaps the earliest established American author to explore homosexuality in fiction. Career Fuller's earliest works were travel romances set in Italy that featured allegorical characters. Both The Chevalier of Pensieri‚ÄìVani (1890) and The Ch√¢telaine of La Trinit√© (1892) bear some thematic resemblance to the works of Henry James, whose primary interest was in the contrast between American and European ways of life. Fuller's first two books appealed to the genteel tastes of cultivated New Englanders such as Charles Eliot Norton and James Russell Lowell, who took Fuller's work as a promising sign of a burgeoning literary culture in what was then still largely the frontier city of Chicago. Fuller then turned to literary realism, writing The Cliff-Dwellers (1893), what is perhaps the first novel set among the skyscrapers and frenetic business culture of modern-day Chicago. The novel shocked and outraged Chicago readers, who found its unflattering portrait of the city jarring. The novel won the praise of the influential critic and novelist William Dean Howells, whose positive review did much to secure Fuller's position as an important regional realist. Novels like The Cliff-Dwellers and With the Procession (1895) were influenced by the social realism of Howells, who described American institutions being transformed by the economic and demographic changes of the late nineteenth century, although the scenes of violence in The Cliff-Dwellers feature elements of naturalism not to be found in Howells' novels. With the Procession, though realistic, was kindlier in touch, with humor playing over its seriousness, unlike the relentless realism of The Cliff-Dwellers. Fuller's preference for Howells over James is the subject of one of Fuller's important unpublished essays entitled \\"Howells or James?\\" Fuller also wrote twelve one- act plays, collected in The Puppet Booth (1896). He wrote for various journals, including The Dial, and he provided some editorial assistance to Poetry in its early years. While he is considered one of the important novelists of Chicago's early years, his own relation to the city was often strained. The scion of one of Chicago's early settler families, he found the increasingly industrial and multicultural nature of the city offputting. His ambivalence is expressed in The Cliff-Dwellers and With the Procession, both of which are set in Chicago. The Cliff-Dwellers is one of the first novels to treat at length social life in the new, skyscraper environment that was pioneered in Chicago. Perhaps his finest achievement is the controversial Bertram Cope's Year (1919), a subtle novel about homosexuals. Fuller self- published the novel in Chicago after unsuccessfully making the rounds of several New York publishing houses. Set on the campus of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, it featured an attractive young English instructor who becomes the elusive object of desire for several young women and at least two men of different ages. Cope's primary emotional attachment is to his effeminate college chum Arthur Lemoyne, who comes to Evanston to live with Cope until Lemoyne is expelled from the campus for making a backstage pass at another male student while dressed as a woman. The novel ends on an ambiguous note concerning the issue of Cope's sexuality. It received less than enthusiastic reviews from critics who did not understand the book's satirical intentions. It puzzled critics and embarrassed his friends. Upon its republication in 1998, it received enthusiastic reviews.New York Times: Joel Cannaroe, \\"Seven Types of Ambiguity,\\" August 9, 1998, accessed September 3, 2011 In 1898, Fuller was also one of the founding members of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony in Illinois. He wrote a column of art criticism for the New York Evening Post. Personal life Fuller was born in Chicago on January 9, 1857. He never married. His journals from his teenage days make it clear he was in love with some dormitory roommates at Allison Classical Academy. At the age of nineteen, he wrote in an imaginary personal advertisement: \\"I would pass by twenty beautiful women to look upon a handsome man\\". At the age of 34 he wrote that he was in love with an adolescent boy who had blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair. Five years later, Fuller wrote and published a short play, At Saint Judas's, about a homosexual who commits suicide at the wedding of his former lover. It is credited with being the first American play dealing explicitly with homosexuality. In 1924 Fuller embarked upon the last of his many European tours with William Emery Shepherd, a 24-year-old college student. Their letters do not indicate their relationship was anything but a friendship. The trip exhausted Fuller, who continued writing literary reviews for a variety of newspapers and magazines upon his return to Chicago, as well as a novel that was published posthumously. Fuller died in Chicago on July 28, 1929, \\"at the home of Wakeman T. Ryan, with whom he had lived for the last three years.\\" His death was ascribed to \\"heart disease, aggravated by the heat.\\"New York Times: \\"Henry Blake Fuller Dies,\\" July 29, 1929, accessed September 3, 2011 Reputation In 2000, Fuller was posthumously inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame for his contributions to gay literature.GLHF: \\"Henry Blake Fuller\\" , accessed September 3, 2011 He was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame in 2017, which also created the \\"Fuller Award\\", honoring \\"lifetime contributions to literature\\".

N. similis is copper coloured with vertical white stripes running from the head to near the base of the tail. It can reach up to in total length. It is a popular freshwater aquarium fish. Breeding habits This fish is monomorphic: males and females are not visually different (males are bigger) and form small colonies or harems - depending on available space - in which the male fry are tolerated until they become active competitors of the male. Female fry are not only tolerated but are eventually courted as mates. The females also are objects of interest to neighboring males and may be targets of theft. The male of the harem goes to great lengths in protecting his territory from intruders (other males) and all members of the harem do their best (and it is much, considering their size) to protect the fry: similis will face fish as big as a Tropheus - if the latter become too curious - and will escape into their shells in a blink of an eye if the threat is deemed serious. Aquarium care N. similis can be kept successfully in aquaria as small as 10 gallons (40 liters), but will do much better in bigger tanks, especially if it is monospecific; they will, however, thrive in a community tank if their tank mates are not much bigger than . Goby cichlids (genera Eretmodus, Spathodus, and Tanganicodus) are ideal Tanganyikan tankmates since they remain relatively small and mainly eat vegetation. The vegetarian genus Tropheus, on the other hand, while remaining relatively small, contracts the oft fatal \\"Malawi bloat\\" when fed on the high protein diet similis require. N. similis should not be kept with other shell dwellers ‚Äî particularly Altolamprologus compressiceps \\"Sumbu shell\\", a predator ‚Äî except when the territories are well-defined by rocks, mounds of sand, or plants. The tank decoration should take into account N. similis' -- habits. N. similis favor a sand substrate in the aquarium and benefit from having access to many empty snail-shells. An excellent go to shell for N. similis are the escargot type shells. Those shells are not only visually attractive and pleasing, but they also come in the perfect size. Rocks can be used as background, but are irrelevant to the fish, except in cases of intense aggression; in such cases, the cover provided by rocks often saves the expelled fish's life. Plants - either real or plastic - can also be introduced, but should be weighted, for this fish is an untiring digger, digging sand pits in which to hide its shells from predators and thieves. In Lake Tanganyika shell dwellers use the Neothauma tanganyicense snail shell as their refuge. In the aquarium, any lightweight shell about the same size, such as a whale's eye shell or empty escargot shell, is acceptable to the similis, and much less expensive for the hobbyist. Having a variety of shell sizes is a good idea as it can allow fish that are smaller to stick with smaller shells. Water parameters are those typical of the Lake ‚Äì pH from 8 to 9, water hardness from 10 to 20¬∞, temperature between , ammonia and nitrites very close to zero, some nitrates. N. similis accept almost any type of food, from standard Cichlid flakes to small pellets, but are far better with shrimp mix, live Artemia larvae, live mosquito larvae (red or black) or \\"Tanganyika Mix\\" are regularly provided. This fish is reputedly easy to spawn. Clean, stable water, varied high-quality food, minimum aggression, and a water change with the temperature one or two degrees below normal, lower PH and far less dissolved solids than dry season environment, similar to rains in the wild which usually provides an abundance of food is usually enough to cause fish to spawn, and Neolamprologus similis is no exception; indeed, once started, they will increase in number fairly rapidly. If the available space is adequate for only one harem, excess males must be removed before the harem's male injures or kills them. Care must be given so that Neolamprologus similis does not crossbreed with the similar and closely related Neolamprologus multifasciatus. N. similis grow slightly larger than \\"multis\\", but the two species are more reliably identified by the following: (1) N. similis stripes extend onto their heads, multis' stripes stop before the head. (2) N. similis has broader brown stripes, making it seem like a brown fish with beige stripes while N. multifasciatus seems like a beige fish with brown stripes.

The space is bordered by Worth Street to the north, Centre Street to the east, and Lafayette Street to the west, and is located south of Manhattan's Chinatown and east of Tribeca. It was named after a prominent Tammany Hall district leader and local saloon owner, Thomas F. \\"Big Tom\\" Foley (1852‚Äì1925). Site Foley Square sits on part of the former site of Collect Pond, specifically the smaller portion known as \\"Little Collect Pond\\" which used to lie to the south of Collect Pond proper. This was one of the original fresh water sources for the city, but in 1811 was drained and filled in because it had become severely polluted and implicated in typhus and cholera outbreaks. The neighborhood around the pond was the notorious Five Points neighborhood, home of many gangs.  Description  The square is the site of a number of civic buildings including the classic facades and colonnaded entrances of the 1933-built United States Courthouse, fronted by the sculpture Triumph of the Human Spirit by artist Lorenzo Pace; the New York County Courthouse; the Church of St. Andrew; the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse ‚Äì known before 2003 as the Foley Square Courthouse ‚Äì where the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is based; the Manhattan Municipal Building; the Ted Weiss Federal Building and the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building and Court of International Trade., p.421. Also featured in the square are five bronze historical medallions, set flush into areas of the surrounding sidewalks, telling the history of the park and its surroundings, including one for the \\"Negro Burial Ground\\", an 18th-century African-American burial ground unearthed during construction of the square. This burial ground has been preserved as the African Burial Ground National Monument. Tilted Arc, a public art installation by Richard Serra, was displayed in the square from 1981 until it was removed amid controversy in 1989. In 2005, Thomas Paine Park was established as a part of the square. Foley Square has been used several times for special purposes. It was used as a triage center on September 11, 2001. The Foley Square Greenmarket operates year-round at the corner of Centre Street between Worth and Pearl Streets, and offers baked goods as well as local farm picked fruits and vegetables which are guaranteed to have been harvested within three days of sale. Because of its proximity to Chinatown, Foley Square is often host to a large group of people performing tai chi in the mornings. Site of protests On November 17, 2011, Foley Square was the site of a protest which was part of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which took place after the protestors had been removed from nearby Zuccotti Park. Thousands of people attended the rally, including members of a dozen different unions.Buckley, Carla. \\"200 Are Arrested As Protesters Clash With the Police\\". The New York Times (November 17, 2011) Foley Square has been the site of many other protests and rallies. In December 2014, many thousands gathered there to protest the decision in the death of Eric Garner. In November 2016, in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline and in solidarity with Standing Rock water protectors, dozens of the thousands of protesters were arrested. In January 2017, to protest the inauguration of Donald Trump, a collection of activist groups organized a rally titled \\"NYC Stand Against Trump\\", held at Foley Square.

The building is located south of the Capitol, bounded by Independence Avenue, New Jersey Avenue, C Street S.E., and South Capitol Street, in southeast Washington. It covers an area of and has a total of 251 congressional offices and suites, five large committee rooms, seven small committee rooms, and a large assembly room now used by the Ways and Means Committee. The building was named in 1962 in honor of the former Speaker of the House, Nicholas Longworth of Ohio. He served as Speaker from 1925 until Republicans lost their majority in 1931, the same year he died, and the same year the building was authorized. History The Longworth Building (center) is located between the Rayburn Building (left, partial view) and Cannon Building (Right) Plans to provide the House of Representatives with a second office building were begun in 1925. Severe overcrowding in the Cannon House Office Building (completed in 1908) led to the renovation of the Cannon Building and the construction of the Longworth Building\\". It is the smallest House office building, with a floor area of just under . Under the direction of Architect of the Capitol David Lynn, preliminary designs for the building were prepared by a local firm known as The Allied Architects of Washington Inc. The principal architects were Frank Upman, Gilbert LaCoste Rodier, Nathan C. Wyeth, and Louis Justemente. They produced \\"two schemes for a simple, dignified building in harmony with the rest of the Capitol Complex. In January 1929 Congress authorized $8.4 million for acquiring and clearing the site and for constructing the new building. The foundations were completed in December 1930, and the building was accepted for occupancy in April 1933\\". The large assembly room of the Longworth Building, which seats 450 people, was used by the House of Representatives as their primary meeting room in 1949 and 1950 while its chamber in the United States Capitol was being remodeled. It is currently the meeting room for the House Ways and Means Committee. In the 1960s, the House Beauty Shop, a salon which catered to Congresspersons, their spouses, and employees, was relocated to the Cannon House Office Building from the smaller Longworth House Office Building under the auspices of the Beauty Shop Committee. \\"Because of its position on a sloping site, the rusticated base of the Longworth Building varies in height from two to four stories. Above this granite base stand the three principal floors, which are faced with white marble. Ionic columns supporting a well- proportioned entablature are used for the building's five porticoes, the principal one of which is topped by a pediment. Two additional stories are partially hidden by a marble balustrade. It presents a somewhat more restrained appearance than the neighboring Cannon Building, which was designed in the more theatrical Beaux Arts style. The Longworth Building takes its place along with the National Gallery of Art (1941) and the Jefferson Memorial (1943) as one of Washington's best examples of the Neo-classical Revival style\\".

(spelled ‡Æµ.‡Æâ.‡Æö‡Æø in Tamil), also known as Kappalottiya Tamizhan \\"The Tamil Helmsman\\", was an Indian freedom fighter and leader of Indian National Congress. Founder of Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company in 1906 to compete against the monopoly of the British India Steam Navigation Company (BISNC). He launched the first indigenous Indian shipping service between Tuticorin and Colombo with the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company, competing against British ships. Tuticorin Port Trust, one of India's thirteen major ports, is named after him. At one time a member of the Indian National Congress, he was later charged with sedition by the British government and sentenced to life imprisonment, and his barrister license was revoked. Early life V. O. Chidambaram Pillai was born on 5 September 1872 in a vellalar family in Ottapidaram, Tuticorin District to Ulaganathan Pillai and Paramayee Ammal. When Chidambaram was six years old, he learned Tamil from teacher Veeraperumal Annavi. He heard stories about Shiva from his grandmother and stories from the Ramayana from his grandfather. He heard stories from Mahabharatha told by Allikulam Subramanya Pillai. As a child, he played goli (mkarbles), kabaddi, horse riding, swimming, stilt walking, archery, wrestling, silambattam and chess. He learned English from a Taluk officer named Krishnan in the evenings. When Krishnan was transferred, Chidambaram's father built a school with the help of villagers and appointed Aramvalarthanatha Pillai from Ettayapuram as the English teacher. The school was run by a priest at Pudhiamuthur. At fourteen, Chidambaram went to Thoothukudi to continue his studies. He studied at CEOA High School and Caldwell High School and in Thoothukudi at the Hindu College High School, Tirunelveli. Chidambaram worked as Taluk office clerk for some time before his father sent him to Tiruchirappalli to study law. He passed his pleadership exam in 1894, returning to Ottapidaram to become a pleader in 1895. In Chennai, Chidambaram met Swami Ramakrishnananda, a saint who belonged to Swami Vivekananda Ashram (monastery), who advised him to \\"do something for the nation\\". Here he met the Tamil poet Bharathiyaar who shared his political ideology. The two men became close friends. Political life=Background In the 1890s and 1900s India's independence movement and the Swadeshi movement, which confirms the politic parcel initiated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai of the Indian National Congress (INC), were at their peak. From 1892 Chidambaram was influenced by Tilak Maharaj and became his disciple.Awakening Indians to India. Chinmaya Mission (2008). p. 68. Along with Subramanya Siva and Subramanya Bharathi, he became a prominent spokesperson for the cause in the Madras Presidency. Following the partition of Bengal in 1905, Chidambaram entered politics, joining the Indian National Congress and taking a hardliner stance. He also presided at the Salem District Congress session. Companies and institutions Chidambaram established many institutions like Yuvanesh Prachar Sabha, Dharmasanga Nesavu Salai, National Godown, Madras Agro-Industrial Society ltd and Desabimana Sangam. In response to the British India Steam Navigation Company's trade monopoly, Chidambaram started an Indian-owned shipping company. He registered the Swadeshi Shipping Company in October 1906.Karat‚Äôs war against US The Telegraph, Retrieved 2 March 2012 The capital of the company was ten lakh rupees. The number of shares was 40,000 and the face value of each share was Rs. 25/-. Any Asian could become a shareholder. The director of the company was Pandi Thurai Thevar, a Zamindar and the founder of \\"Madurai Tamil Sangam\\". In the beginning, the Company owned no ships, instead leasing them from Shawline Steamers Company. The B.I.S.N.C. pressured Shawline Steamers to cancel the lease; in response, Chidambaram leased a single large freighter from Sri Lanka. Realizing the need for the Swadeshi Shipping Company to own its own vessels, Chidambaram travelled around India selling shares in the company to raise capital. He vowed, \\"I will come back with Ships. Otherwise I will perish in the sea\\". He managed to secure sufficient funds to purchase the company's first ship, the S.S. Gallia;M. Soundarapandian; Environment, Degradation And Rural Poverty, Discovery Publishing House 2005, p44 shortly afterwards, they were able to acquire the S.S. Lavo from France. In response to the new competition, the B.I.S.N.C. reduced the fare per trip to Re.1 (16 annas) per head. The Swadeshi company responded by offering a fare of Re.0.5 (8 Annas). The British company went further by offering a free trip to the passengers with a free umbrella; however, nationalist sentiment meant that the free service was underused. The B.I.S.N.C. attempted to buy out Chidambaram, but he refused the deal. The ships commenced regular service between Tuticorin and Colombo (Sri Lanka) against opposition from British traders and the Imperial Government. Coral Mill strike On 23 February 1908 Chidambaram gave a speech at Thoothukudi, encouraging the workers at Coral Mill (now part of Madura Coats) to protest against their low wages and harsh working conditions. Four days later, the workers of the Coral Mill went on strike. Chidambaram and Subramanya Siva led the strike. Their demands included incremental earnings, weekly holidays and other leave facilities. Chidambaram ensured the strike was widely publicised, and it quickly gained popular support. On 6 March the head clerk Subramanya Pillai met Chidambaram and said that the management was ready to concede their demands. Chidambaram went with 50 workers and met the managers, who agreed to increase the wages, to reduce the working hours and to give leave on Sundays. The workers went back after a nine-day strike. The outcome of the strike encouraged the workers of other European companies, who also gained increased wages and better treatment. Aurobindo appreciated Chidambaram and Siva for the unequalled skill and courage with which the fight was conducted in his Vande Mataram daily on 13 March 1908. Arrest and imprisonment Gandhi Mandapam Guindy By 1908, Chidambaram's political involvement drew the attention of the British. Hearing of his intention to speak at a rally celebrating the release of Bengali leader Bipin Chandra Pal, Winch, a British official invited Chidambaram to meet him in Thirunelveli with his political comrade Subramanya Siva. At the meeting, Winch expressed concern about Chidambaram's activities and asked him to give assurances that he would not participate in any political revolt. Chidambaram refused to accept his conditions, so he and Siva were arrested on 12 March 1908. The arrest was followed by widespread protest. In Thirunelveli shops, schools and colleges were closed in protest, and rioting broke out. The Thirunelveli municipal office, post offices, police stations and municipal courts were attacked. A general strike was declared in Thoothukudi, which was the first political strike in India. Public meetings and processions were held, and four people were killed by the police. Although his supporters were able to raise sufficient funds for bail, Chidambaram refused to leave the jail without the release of Siva and his other comrades. Subramanya Bharathi and Subramanya Siva also appeared in the court for questioning for the case instituted against Chidambaram. He was charged under sections 123-A and 153-A of the Indian Penal Code for speaking against the British and giving shelter to Siva. Chidambaram refused to take part in the proceedings. He was charged with sedition, and a sentence of two life imprisonments (in effect forty years) was imposed. He was confined in the Central Prison, Coimbatore from 9 July 1908 to 1 December 1910. The judgement was widely condemned in the popular press, with even the British Statesmen magazine claiming that it was unjust. Chidambaram appealed the sentence in High Court, gaining a reduced punishment of four years imprisonment and six years in exile. An appeal to the Privy Council led to a further reduction in sentence. Chidambaram was interned in Coimbatore and Kannanoor jail. He was not treated as a political prisoner, nor was the sentence de facto of simple imprisonment; rather, he was treated as a convict sentenced to life imprisonment and required to do hard labour, which caused his health to suffer. Historian and Tamil scholar R. A. Padmanabhan later noted in his works that Chidambaram was \\"yoked (in place of bulls) to the oil press like an animal and made to work it in the cruel hot sun....\\" From prison Chidambaram continued correspondence, maintaining a steady stream of legal petitions. He was finally released on 12 December 1912. To his dismay, the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company had already been liquidated in 1911, and the ships were auctioned to their competitors. The company's first ship, the SS Gallia, was sold to the British Shipping Company. Later life Upon Chidambaram's release he was not permitted to return to Tirunelveli district. With his law license stripped from him, he moved to Chennai with his wife and two young sons. There he ran a provisions store and a kerosene store. V. O. Chidambaram had a long correspondence with Gandhi, not yet Mahatma, from 1915 to 1920. In 1915, when Gandhi visited Chennai (Madras then), both had met. Some in South Africa with Indian origin had collected money to help V. O. Chidambaram and transmitted the amount through Gandhi. However, V. O. Chidambaram did not receive the money. He had some lengthy correspondence with Gandhi on the subject. In one instance Gandhi wrote a postcard to V. O. Chidambaram in Tamil with his own hand. V. O. Chidambaram was delighted on seeing the postcard and, for a moment, forgot about the money dispute. The term Gandhi Kanakku (in Tamil meaning Gandhi's accounting) became prevailing because of this incident. The term is often used in South India to refer to any debt where it is impossible for the money to be repaid, because Gandhi did not return the money to VOC with excuses. But on 4 February 1916, V.O. Chidamabaram wrote to a friend, \\"Rs. 347-12-0 has come from Sriman Gandhi.\\". In 1920, Chidambaram withdrew from the Indian National Congress, citing ideological differences with Mahatma Gandhi. He focused his efforts on establishing labor unions in Madras and writing. After moving to Coimbatore Chidambaram, he worked as a bank manager. Dissatisfied with the income, he petitioned the court, seeking permission to practice law again. Judge E.H. Wallace gave permission to restore Chidambaram's pleadership license; to show his gratitude Chidambaram named his last son Valacewaran. Chidambaram moved to Kovilpatti and practiced as a lawyer. He rejoined the Congress party in 1927 and presided over the third political conference held at Salem. He said that he wanted to join Congress again because he noticed a remarkable change in the policies of Congress and was happy to note that the policies of which he did not approve were withdrawn one by one. However, after the Salem conference Chidambaram again severed his contact with Congress. In 1929 he moved to Thoothukudi, where he spent his time writing and publishing Tamil books. By 1935, he had written commentary on the first book of the Tirukkural (Book of Virtue) and was published under a different title. However, it was only in 2008 that the complete work of his commentary on the Kural was published. Death He died on 18 November 1936.

Si. brought the fame of Chidambaram to the limelight. Books written by Ma. Po. Si. on V.O. Chidambaram Pillai are Kappalottiya Thamizhan (1944), Kappalottiya Chidambaranar (1972) and Thalapathy Chidambaranar (1950). Film portrayal In 1961 Kannada film director B.R. Panthalu made a film of Chidambaram's life titled Kappalottiya Thamizhan. Chidambaram was portrayed by Sivaji Ganesan, Subramanya Siva by T. K. Shanmugam and Subramanya Barathi by S. V. Subbaiah. The story of this movie is based on Ma. Po. Si.'s biography 'Kappalottiya Tamizhan'.

Coming from Brisbane, Queensland, Sprenger who is coached by Michael Bohl spent the beginning of his career as the understudy of fellow Australians Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett. After finishing third in the 200-metre freestyle at the 2003 Australian Championships, Sprenger was selected to make his debut at the age of 18 at the 2003 FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Spain, where he was a part of the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay team which won gold ahead of the United States team. The following year, he was again third behind Thorpe and Hackett, and was a part of the team alongside Thorpe, Hackett and Michael Klim which was defeated by the Americans in Athens in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay, ending Australia's six-year reign in the event. In 2005, with Thorpe taking a year off, Sprenger assumed the number 2 middle-distance swimmer role behind Hackett. Despite being involved in a mild car accident in late May, and being prevented from performing the complete training repertoire until one week before the event, Sprenger went on to set gallant personal bests in both the 200-metre and 400-metre events at the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montreal, Canada, in July, placing fifth in the 200-metre event in a time of 1 minute 47.09 seconds. He also collected a bronze medal as part of the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay. In 2006, with Australian captain Hackett sidelined with by a shoulder operation, Sprenger appeared likely to have another opportunity to establish himself as a world-class swimmer. However, he was plagued by a virus and was unable to compete. His cousin Christian Sprenger is a breaststroker who broke the world record in the men's 200-metre breaststroke at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome. At the trials for the 2008 Summer Olympics Sprenger came third in the 200-metre freestyle only 0.07 of a second behind Kenrick Monk. However, the winner Grant Hackett was not seeking an individual berth in the event, so Sprenger will compete as Australia's second qualifier in the event at Beijing. He is also a member of the Australian 4√ó200-metre freestyle team, trying to beat the Americans. However, at the Olympics, Sprenger was eliminated in the semifinals and was then dropped from the relay team, competing in neither the heats nor finals. His colleagues captured the bronze medal in his absence.

Jolly was born in Heidelberg, the son of physicist Philipp Johann Gustav von Jolly (1809-1884), and studied comparative linguistics, Sanskrit, and Iranian languages in Berlin and Leipzig. His doctoral thesis was Die Moduslehre in den alt-iranischen Dialekten (\\"Moods in Ancient Iranian Dialects\\"). Jolly became a Professor in the University of W√ºrzburg in 1877, in the fields of comparative linguistics and Sanskrit. In 1882-1883 he visited India as Tagore professor of law, Calcutta, where he gave twelve lectures later published as Outlines of an History of the Hindu Law of Partition, Inheritance and Adoption (1885). In 1896, Jolly contributed to Grundriss der Indo-arischen Philologie und Altertumskunde (\\"Encyclopedia of Indo-Aryan Research\\"), later revised by Jolly and in 1928 translated by Balakrishna Ghosh under the title Hindu Law and Custom. In this volume Jolly discussed family law and heirship, law of things and obligations, offences and penalties, court procedure and customs and traditions. In 1901 he also contributed a study of Indian medicine, still considered one of the most complete and reliable studies of the history of Indian medical literature. Jolly edited the law books of Vishnu, Narada, and Manu, and translated the first two for the Sacred Books of the East (Vol. 7, The Institutes of Visnu, 1880; and Vol. 33, The Minor Law-Books: Brihaspati, 1889). He retired in 1922, when he became co-editor of the Journal of Indian History, but continued to give lectures in W√ºrzburg till 1928. He published a new critical edition of Kautilya's Arthashastra in collaboration with R. Schmidt in the \\"Panjab Sanskrit Series\\", 1923-1924.

The United Church in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands is United church in Methodist and the Reformed tradition. It was formed in 1968 by merging the efforts of the London Missionary Society (operating exclusively in Papua), the relatively marginal Presbyterian church (largely confined to Port Moresby itself) and the Methodist mission (largely operating in New Guinea and nearby islands, the western and northern Solomons and the islands of eastern Papua). Since 1996, there is a United Church in Papua New Guinea and a separate United Church in Solomon Islands. History Village United Church choir in a choral competition in Siwai, Bougainville, 1978. United Church in a West Solomons village with a moment bearing bones from the people's cannibalism past. Female minister of the United Church in a south Bougainvillean village. The formation of the United Church pre-dates the merger of its corresponding (and one missionary parent though Methodists from New Zealand) denominations in Australia in 1977 in the Uniting Church in Australia but such cross-denominational mergers were common throughout the 20th century, particularly in Commonwealth countries: for example; the United Church of Northern India (1924) (now merged in the later and wider Church of North India, Church of Pakistan, and Church of Bangladesh); the United Church of Canada (1925) and the Church of South India (1947). It is particularly strong on the Papuan coast, the Southern Highlands, eastern Papua, the New Guinea Islands (including Bougainville, also known as the North Solomons), and the Western Solomons. Unlike the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in Papua New Guinea for reasons of church tradition as well as for Anglicans' cultural attitudes where it is substantial, the United Church welcomes female clergy. Like Presbyterian, Methodist, Congregationalist and United or Uniting churches elsewhere, its services are primarily for worship with scripture lessons, prayers and sermons, communion being once in a month or every few months. As these denominations in western countries have in recent years lost many members and participants to a lack of worship at all in recent decades, the United Church of Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands has lost some to more fundamentalist sects. Local and overseas affiliations The United Church is a member of the Papua New Guinea Council of Churches, Melanesian Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches. In matters of social policy it tends as with its sister denominations in other Commonwealth countries to be largely in accord with the Anglican and Lutheran churches. Traditionally, many of the United Church's personnel were recruited from earlier-established Methodist and Congregationalist churches in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga; the United Church continues to have close relations with sister churches in these neighbouring island countries. Its theology and social policy tends to be somewhat more akin to these theologically conservative neighbouring countries' long-established evangelical Protestant churches than to those in Australia. On the other hand, the Church is considerably more broad-minded in such matters than more recently arrived fundamentalist groups, and it maintains the historic Methodist and Congregational strong emphasis on education and literacy in the broadest sense. As with the Anglican and Lutheran churches, the United Church has suffered some attrition in recent decades as a result of aggressive proselytising among its constituents by fundamentalist and pentecostalist groups originating in the United States of America and, to a lesser extent, Australia. Many of Papua New Guinea's leaders have had a United Church background.

In psychoanalytic literature, a Madonna‚Äìwhore complex is the inability to maintain sexual arousal within a committed, loving relationship. First identified by Sigmund Freud, under the rubric of psychic impotence,W. M. Bernstein, A Basic Theory of Neuropsychoanalysis (2011) p. 106 this psychological complex is said to develop in men who see women as either saintly Madonnas or debased prostitutes. Men with this complex desire a sexual partner who has been degraded (the whore) while they cannot desire the respected partner (the Madonna). Freud wrote: \\"Where such men love they have no desire and where they desire they cannot love.\\" Clinical psychologist Uwe Hartmann, writing in 2009, stated that the complex \\"is still highly prevalent in today's patients\\". The term is also used popularly, if sometimes with subtly different meanings. Causes Freud argued that the Madonna‚Äìwhore complex was caused by a split between the affectionate and the sexual currents in male desire.Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 251 Oedipal and castration anxiety fears prohibit the affection felt for past incestuous objects from being attached to women who are sensually desired: \\"The whole sphere of love in such persons remains divided in the two directions personified in art as sacred and profane (or animal) love\\". In order to minimize anxiety, the man categorizes women into two groups: women he can admire and women he finds sexually attractive. Whereas the man loves women in the former category, he despises and devalues the latter group.Tuch, Richard (2010). \\"Murder on the Mind: Tyrannical Power and Other Points along the Perverse Spectrum\\". The International Journal of Psychoanalysis 91 (1): 141-162. . Psychoanalyst Richard Tuch suggests that Freud offered at least one alternative explanation for the Madonna‚Äìwhore complex: > This earlier theory is based not on oedipal-based castration anxiety but on > man's primary hatred of women, stimulated by the child's sense that he had > been made to experience intolerable frustration and/or narcissistic injury > at the hands of his mother. According to this theory, in adulthood the boy- > turned-man seeks to avenge these mistreatments through sadistic attacks on > women who are stand-ins for mother. It is possible that such a split may be exacerbated when the sufferer is raised by a cold but overprotective motherP. A Sacco, Madonna Complex (2011) p. 48 ‚Äì a lack of emotional nurturing paradoxically strengthening an incestuous tie.Neville Symington, Narcissism (1993) p. 99 Such a man will often court someone with maternal qualities, hoping to fulfill a need for maternal intimacy unmet in childhood, only for a return of the repressed feelings surrounding the earlier relationship to prevent sexual satisfaction in the new. Another theory claims that the Madonna‚Äìwhore complex derives from the alleged representations of women as either madonnas or whores in mythology and Judeo-Christian theology rather than developmental disabilities of individual men.Feinman, Clarice. Women in the criminal justice system. Westport, CT: Praeger, 1994, pp. 3-4, . Sexual politics Naomi Wolf considered that the sexual revolution had paradoxically intensified the importance of the virgin‚Äìwhore split, leaving women to contend with the worst aspects of both images.Naomi Wolf, Promiscuities (1997) p. 5 and p. 131 Others consider that both men and women find integrating sensuality and an ideal femininity difficult to do within the same relationship.Robert Bly/Marion Woodman, The Maiden King (1999) p. 203 In popular culture Tiziano's Sacred and Profane Love. * Tiziano's Sacred and Profane Love (1514, the sacred- profane title is from 1693) has several interpretations. The clothed woman has said to be dressed as a bride The painting was listed as #10 in this exhibition, but did not in fact appear) and as a courtesan. Brown, 240 The nude woman seems at first sight to be an allegory of profane love, but 20th- century assessments notice the incense on her hand and the church beyond her. Hitchcock and Novak in Vertigo *James Joyce widely utilized the Madonna-whore polarity in his novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. His protagonist, Stephen Daedalus, sees girls who he admires as ivory towers, and the repression of his sexual feelings for them eventually leads him to solicit a prostitute. This mortal sin drives Stephen's inner conflict and eventual transformation towards the end of the novel. *Alfred Hitchcock used the Madonna‚Äìwhore dichotomy as an important mode of representing women. In Vertigo (1958), for example, Kim Novak portrays two women that the hero cannot reconcile: a virtuous, blonde, sophisticated, sexually repressed \\"madonna\\" and a dark-haired, single, sensual \\"fallen woman\\".Gordon, Paul. Dial \\"M\\" for Mother: A Freudian Hitchcock. Madison, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2008, pp. 89-91, . *Pamela Thurschwell highlighted \\"the range of [Bob] Dylan's women, which may often begin with a fine line in madonnas and whores but which often go on to undercut each other in spectacular reversals\\".Quoted in N. Corcoran ed., Do You, Mr Jones? (2002) p. 269 *The Martin Scorsese films, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, feature sexually obsessed protagonists, both played by Robert De Niro, who exhibit the Madonna‚Äìwhore complex with the women they interact with. Ebert, R. (1976, 7 March). Interview with Martin Scorsese  Interviews  Roger Ebert. Madonna holds an impersonator wearing her Like a Virgin bride dress in 2008. * The singer Madonna played with both identities, specially in her earlier career. Madonna herself declared: \\"I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be‚Äîthe Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so.\\" *Sex and the City mentioned Madonna‚Äìwhore when describing Trey (played by Kyle MacLachlan) and Charlotte's (played by Kristin Davis) sex-life after they got married. Trey was unable to maintain an erection whenever trying to have sex with Charlotte due to the Madonna‚Äìwhore complex. Charlotte was able to change that by touching herself in front of him. *In the Seinfeld episode The Sponge, Jerry is unsure how he will have sex with his new girlfriend Lena, on account of her being a charitable and wholesome person. *In the episode \\"Limelight\\" of Criminal Minds the team find an unsub with the complex. They believe this mixed with a severe mental condition caused a delusion where he would rape, electrocute, and strangle women in high end jobs. *In American Horror Story: Asylum, set in a mental asylum during the 1960s, a time when the field of psychoanalysis was in chaos, the repressed character Dr. Arthur Arden, as portrayed by James Cromwell, is fixated on a seemingly innocent and virtuous nun. When she later sexually propositions him, he bitterly defaces and then destroys a statue of the Virgin Mary (a.k.a. the Madonna), screaming \\"Whore!\\" at it accusingly. Earlier in the series, Arden had shown to subscribe to Freudian theory regarding feminine sexuality. *In The Handmaid's Tale, women are strictly categorised and forced to wear a uniform of a specified colour, representative of their status as \\"Madonna\\" or \\"whore\\". The Handmaids, who are disrespected and violated continually, are made to wear red, which is associated with sex and fertility; the protagonist, a nameless Handmaid, is objectified and abused by the Commander, Fred. In contrast, the wives wear blue which is reminiscent of the virgin Mary; Serena, Fred's wife, doesn't get the attention she wants from her husband.

He began racing in 1905, finishing second in the Victoria Day race at Caledonia, Ontario. His first important victory was in the Around the Bay Road Race in Hamilton, Ontario in 1906, which he won by three minutes. In 1907 he won the Boston Marathon in a record time of 2:24:24 over the old 24-1/2 mile course, four minutes and 59 seconds faster than any of the previous ten winners of the event. He collapsed, however, in the 1908 Olympic Games marathon, along with several other leading runners, and a rematch was organized the same year at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Longboat won this race, turned professional, and in 1909 at the same venue won the title of Professional Champion of the World by defeating Dorando Pietri and Alfred Shrubb in front of sell-out crowds. Tom Longboat, 1907 His coaches did not approve of his alternation of hard workouts with \\"active rest\\" such as long walks.

Because of this and other disputes with his managers Longboat bought out his contract, after which his times improved. Knee and back issues began to plague Longboat post-1909. Although this was public knowledge, reporters and fans often blamed \\"Indian laziness\\" for his occasional poor showing. Longboat's former manager, Tom Flanagan, spread false rumours that Longboat trained infrequently, contributing to this public attitude of sportswriters towards Longboat. In 1911, he was given a suspended sentence in Toronto for drunkenness, which led to additional criticism from reporters. While many newspaper columns were devoted to his supposed alcoholism, the facts of Longboat's racing career and post-athletic work appear to be in strong contradiction. It has been suggested that efforts to encourage the temperance movement within First Nations society may have been the cause of such reporting. Regardless of the intentions behind such coverage, not a month later Longboat won two major races at Hanlan's Point Stadium, setting a personal best in the 12-mile race. Members of his family wouldn't even believe how fast he could run over such a long distance until he gave his brother a half an hour head start driving a horse and buggy while he ran on foot, and yet he still made it to Hamilton first. Longboat's chief rival was Alfred Shrubb, whom he raced ten times, winning all the races at 20 miles or more and losing all those at shorter distances. Longboat served as a dispatch runner in France in World War I while maintaining a professional career. He was twice wounded and twice declared dead while serving in Belgium. Stories said that he had entered a communication trench which was buried by an exploding shell, where he and his comrades were trapped for six days (albeit with sufficient oxygen and provisions) before being rescued. However, Longboat himself debunked that particular myth in an interview with Lou Marsh in 1919. He retired following the war. While officially an amateur, Longboat had lost only three total races, one of which was his first, the Victoria Day race. By the time he had turned professional, he owned two national track records and several unofficial world records. After joining the professional ranks, he set world records for the 24 and 32-kilometre races and had nearly set the world record for 19 kilometres. Personal life Longboat grew up in a poor family that lived on a small farm. His father died when Longboat was 3 years old. He was enrolled at the Mohawk Institute Residential School at age 12, a legal obligation under the Indian Act at that time. He hated life at the school, where he was pressured to give up his Onondaga beliefs in favour of Christianity. He was also expected to give up his language. After one unsuccessful escape attempt, Longboat tried again and reached the home of his uncle. His uncle hid him from authorities. After Longboat's athletic successes, he was invited to speak at the institute. He refused, stating that \\"I wouldn't even send my dog to that place.\\"First Nations Athletes, in History and in the Media: Tom Longboat and Steve Collins: Background, Historica Canada In 1908, he married Lauretta Maracle. In February 1916 , he enlisted in the Canadian Army running messages between military posts. While he was serving with the Canadian Army, he fell victim to what would later be termed identity theft. From late 1916 until the summer of 1917, a white Rhode Island-born vaudeville singer, conman and onetime medicine show performer named Edgar Laplante (1888-1944) travelled around America pretending to be him and giving concerts that profited from Longboat's continued celebrity. In August 1917 Laplante arrived in New York City, where he enrolled under Longboat's name as a civilian crewman with the U.S. Army Transport Service. News of Longboat joining this branch of the military generated numerous American newspaper stories, which were illustrated by photographs of Laplante, who looked nothing like the real Longboat. During Laplante's initial voyage aboard the S.S. Antilles, a debate raged in the \\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\\" regarding whether the real Longboat was in France or serving with the U.S. Army Transport Service. The \\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\\" sided with the imposter. Eventually, Longboat heard about the imposter's antics and wrote a letter about them, which ended up being quoted in several American newspapers.Paul Willetts, 'King Con: The Bizarre Adventures of the Jazz Age's Greatest Impostor (Crown Publishing, 2018) In his letter he threatened legal action against the imposter. \\"I am going to have three charges against this man, one for making false statements, second for impersonation, third [for] intent to defraud the public at large.\\" \\"Cincinnati Enquirer, October 28, 1917, p.4. When erroneous reports reached America that Longboat had been killed in action while serving with the Canadian Army in France, the consequent American newspaper stories were often illustrated by photos of the imposter, Edgar Laplante. On the basis that Longboat really was dead, his wife Lauretta remarried during 1918. Although pleased to find out he had survived, she had no desire to leave her new husband. Longboat later married Martha Silversmith, with whom he had four children. After the war, Longboat settled in Toronto where he worked until 1944. He retired to the Six Nations reserve and died of pneumonia on January 9, 1949. Legacy A federal historical marker in Oshwekan, Ontario, reflects Longboat's status as a National Historic Person After Longboat's death, Alfred Shrubb stated in an interview that \\"he was one of the greatest, if not the greatest marathoner of all time.\\" In 1951, the Tom Longboat Awards were instituted by Jan Eisenhardt. This program, administered since 1999 by the Aboriginal Sport Circle, annually honours outstanding First Nations athletes and sportsmen in each province; national male and female winners are selected from the provincial winners. Longboat was inducted into both Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, (in 1955) the Ontarian Sports hall of Fame and the Indian Hall of Fame. Longboat is also commemorated annually by the Toronto Island 10 km race. In 1976, Longboat was designated a National Historic Person.Tom Longboat National Historic Person, Directory of Federal Heritage Designations, Parks Canada, no date. In 1978, in honour of Longboat, the Scarborough Board of Education opened the doors to their newest school: Tom Longboat Junior Public School. Tom Longboat was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He was the first person of Native American descent (Onondaga) to win the Boston Marathon, and one of only two Native Americans ever to win it (the other being Ellison Brown, a Narragansett). A 46-cent first-class postage stamp honouring Longboat was issued by Canada Post on February 17, 2000.Tom Longboat: Marathon Man, Canadian Postage Stamps In 2008, the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Association organized the naming of many lanes in their area of the City of Toronto. A lane south of Longboat Avenue was officially named Tom Longboat Lane in 2013. (City by-Law 174-2013) In 2008, June 4 was officially declared \\"Tom Longboat Day\\" in Ontario with the passage of Bill 120, a Private Member's Bill put forward by MPP Michael Colle. Google's June 4, 2018 Doodle celebrates the life and legacy of Tom Longboat, and was distributed across Canada and the United States.

It was founded in Sedona, Arizona in 2003 by the late poet Christopher Lane, who served as the organization's executive director until his death in August 2012. The group is run by a seven-member advisory board. The group ran weekly poetry open mics, biweekly and monthly poetry slams, poetry workshops, featured poetry readings, poet in residence programs in Northern Arizona high schools, maintained a Web site with a calendar of events and several book partnerships, which sold local poets' work in Northern Arizona bookstores. The group networked two poetry slams: FlagSlam in Flagstaff and VerdeSlam Sedona, Arizona and has a reputation in the national slam poetry scene for treating touring poets with great respect, with booking events, transportation to and from performances and venues, and lodging at the homes of members of the local poetry community. Poetry organizers in Northern Arizona had sent slams teams to the National Poetry Slam since 2001, officially representing Flagstaff, although the team's members were from various parts of the region. Between early 2004 and mid-2007, the team competed in local, regional and national poetry slams under the banner \\"Team NORAZ\\". NORAZ Poets is one of the only rural and regional poetry organizations in the United States. The organization earned nonprofit tax status in February 2005. In March 2005, NORAZ Poets created the Alzheimer's Poetry Project Arizona Assignment (a branch of the national Alzheimer's Poetry Project). Some of the poets affiliated with the group include Robin John Anderson, Jordan Sebastian Bonner, Mary Carvell Bragg, the late Rochelle Brener, Portlin Cochise, Rebekah Crisp, Patrick David DuHaime, Gary Every, Jen Valencia, Josh Fleming, Dom Flemons, Nick Fox, Karyl Goldsmith, Jesse Dyllan Grace, Christopher Fox Graham, Andy \\"War\\" Hall, Dee Hamilton, Brent Heffron, Mary Heyborne, Cass J.

In mid-2007, NORAZ Poets effectively ceased its poetry slam activities. Flagstaff area poetry slam events were then taken up by FlagSlam, led by Ryan Brown, John Cartier, Frank O'Brien, Jessica Guadarrama, Dana Sakowicz, Kamryn Henderson, among others. Sedona and Verde Valley area poetry slam events were then taken up by Gary Every and Christopher Fox Graham.

Early years Located at 801 Bagby Street near downtown, the Coliseum and Music Hall complex replaced the Sam Houston Hall, which was a wooden structure that had been erected on the site for the 1928 Democratic National Convention and torn down in 1936.Venue information and background The Public Works Administration contributed $1,329,508 to the project designed by architect Alfred C. Finn. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on November 4, 1936. The arena opened in November 1937 and had a capacity of 9,200. It was built in conjunction with the Houston Music Hall, which was adjacent to the Coliseum. Notable performers On October 14, 1956, Elvis Presley's concert at the Coliseum ended abruptly, as he and his band were taken away by police escort, just before the end of the show as a mob of about 1,000 teenagers rushed the stage, their instruments being destroyed as a result. On November 21, 1963, United States President John F. Kennedy gave a speech in the Houston Coliseum, on what would be the last night of his life. John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas the following day. On August 19, 1965, The Beatles performed at the Coliseum. On August 20, 1967, James Brown performed at the Coliseum. On July 10, 1968, The Doors performed at the Coliseum with the opening band Moving Sidewalks, featuring Billy Gibbons who would go on to form ZZ Top less than a year later. Supergroup Cream (band) played there on October 24, 1968.http://www.setlist.fm Jimi Hendrix played at the venue on June 6, 1970, three months before he died. Ike & Tina Turner performed at the Coliseum on July 31, 1971. The First National Women's Conference, a milestone for the modern women's movement, was held at the Coliseum in November 1977. Ozzy Osbourne with Randy Rhoads played at the venue on June 7, 1981 and February 17, 1982. The Black Crowes played a free concert at the venue on February 6, 1993. The free show was due to security problems that forced the cancellation of a show during a previous Houston visit. The show was broadcast nationally on radio across North America and also was videotaped for the video \\"Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye\\". The audio version was released on EPs, dubbed \\"High in Houston\\". This would be the last concert performed at the Coliseum before it was demolished. Sports In 1946, permanent ice chillers were installed in the floor to accommodate an ice hockey rink for Houston's first pro ice hockey team ‚Äì the Houston Skippers of the USHL. The Skippers changed their name the following season to the Houston Huskies and called the Coliseum home until their demise in 1949. Prior to Hofheinz Pavilion being built (on the campus of the University of Houston), the Houston Cougars played home games at the coliseum. The venue also played host to the Houston Apollos, of the CPHL, from 1965‚Äì1969; the Houston Aeros, of the WHA, from 1972‚Äì1975 and the Houston Apollos of the CHL, from 1979‚Äì1981. The Aeros moved to The Houston Summit, which opened in November 1975 and played their final three seasons there. The Houston Mavericks, a charter member of the American Basketball Association, played their home games in the Coliseum. However, the Houston franchise was plagued by mismanagement and low attendance. In 1969, the team relocated and became the Carolina Cougars. The Mavericks drew less than 500 fans for most games; their final game in Houston drew just 89 fans.http://www.remembertheaba.com/Houston-Mavericks.html The Coliseum was also home to Houston Wrestling, run by legendary wrestling promoter Paul Boesch. In an event promoted by Boesch, Jack Brisco defeated Harley Race to win the National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Championship at the Coliseum on July 20, 1973. Fate By the 1970s, the arena was starting to show its age. Its fate was effectively sealed in 1971, when the NBA's San Diego Rockets moved to Houston and insisted on building a new arena‚Äîwhat became the Summit‚Äîas a replacement. When the Rockets arrived, they would not even consider playing in the Coliseum while the Summit was being built, deeming it inadequate even for temporary use; instead, they played their first few seasons at Hofheinz Pavilion. Sam Houston Coliseum was demolished in 1998. The former site of the Sam Houston Coliseum was redeveloped into the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, which opened in 2003.

His father, Maulvi Abdul Hannan was a prominent figure from the Pashtun Kakar tribe that had fiercely opposed the British raj in India. Nishtar's ancestors hailed from Zhob district in north Balochistan but had later settled in Peshawar, British India. He completed his early education in a Christian mission school and later Sanathan Dharam High School in Bombay, (now 'Mumbai' in India). He eventually graduated from the Edwardes College in Peshawar and then later on completed his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Punjab University, Lahore in 1923. He later went to Aligarh and received an LL.B degree with honours from Aligarh Muslim University in 1925. Political career A man of deep religious convictions, he also had a deep interest in Islamic mysticism, a fact which probably reflects the influence of his parents and also his associate Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar. From 1919 to 1920, both of them actively participated in the Khilafat Movement. Later, Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar remained member of Indian National Congress from 1927 to 1931, was elected Municipal Commissioner, Peshawar Municipal committee, successively from 1929 to 1938, joined All-India Muslim League, became a confidante of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah. From 1932 to 1936, Nishtar was a member of All India Muslim League (AIML) Council, member NWFP (Northwest Frontier Province) legislative Assembly 1937 to 1945, Finance Minister NWFP 1943‚Äì45, member AIML Working Committee, 1944‚Äì1947, represented the All India Muslim League at the Simla Conference in 1945.Abdur Rab Nishtar profile on Pioneers of Freedom website Retrieved 7 October 2019 Abdur Rab Nishtar was ousted from provincial politics through the political maneuvers of a rival political leader Abdul Qayyum Khan in 1946. Abdul Qayyum Khan was an outcaste from the Indian National Congress Party, who then vigorously opposed that political party after his ouster from it,Robert Aura Smith, Divided India (Read Books, 2007), pp. 241‚Äì242 especially he was against the union of the Indian subcontinent in a single country and was working for the creation of an independent Muslim state.Rajmohan Gandhi, Patel: a Life, p. 416 As Federal Minister After the Dominion of Pakistan was created, Nishtar was appointed Minister for communication in Pakistan and served in that position from 1947 to 1949. He introduced the use of Urdu language in Pakistan railways and Pakistan Post Office. After the dismissal of the Punjab Provincial government in 1949, Sardar Nishtar was appointed Governor of Punjab (the first Pakistani governor in Pakistan's history, till that time the British government had still continued governing with previous English Governors). He effectively ran the Governorship for two years paving the way for restoration of an elected government in 1951. Nomination for Prime Minister Nishtar was considered a serious contender for the post of Prime Minister after Liaqat Ali Khan's assassination. His appointment was blocked by senior secularists and liberal officials including the future President Iskander Mirza because of Nishtar's conservative and Islamic views. Became Opposition Leader against corrupt politicians He subsequently fell out with the government over the dismissal of Prime minister Khawaja Nazimuddin's government by Governor General Ghulam Muhammad.Profile of Governor General Ghulam Muhammad on storyofpakistan.com website Updated 1 June 2003, Retrieved 8 October 2019 Refusing to be involved in what he perceived as an undemocratic act, Nishtar went into opposition. In 1956, when the first Pakistani constitution was adopted, Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar was elected president of the party against the wishes of President Iskandar Mirza and then prime minister Chaudhry Mohammad Ali who were backing Dr. Khan Sahib as West Pakistan chief minister while Nishtar wanted an Muslim League man for the office. But a big majority of the League leaders, including Nawab Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani and Mumtaz Daultana, supported Iskander Mirza. Leader of Muslim League He subsequently took over the leadership of the Muslim League party and the League was expected to do well in West Pakistan in the planned 1959 elections but unfortunately he died before that. He served as President, Pakistan Muslim League from 1956 to 1958.

He had been suffering from heart disease and high blood pressure since 1953. Nishtar Medical College and Nishtar Hospital in the city of Multan are named in his honor. Nishtar Park and Nishtar Road in Karachi are named after him. He was buried at Mazar-e-Quaid near the Tomb of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founding father of Pakistan to acknowledge his services in the cause of Pakistan. Abdul Rab Nishtar had a reputation of being a sincere political leader and a man of amicable nature. With his political activities, he contributed greatly to All-India Muslim League and the Muslims living in the Indian subcontinent, creating political consciousness and Islamic spirit among them. Abdul Rab Nishtar was a close friend of both Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar and Maulana Shaukat Ali. At one point during their association, Muhammad Ali Jauhar had told Nishtar that he opposed Jinnah for re- organization of the All-India Muslim League. After finding out all the details of Jinnah-Jauhar discussion, Nishtar decided to support Jinnah's proposal and even succeeded in convincing Jauhar to do the same.

Events take place in a Quaker Meeting House, usually in the Birmingham area. It is, strictly speaking, responsible to Warwickshire Monthly Meeting, though it attracts participants from across the United Kingdom. The appendage of the word 'Junior' to the name is in order to distinguish from Young Friends usually used to describe Quakers aged 18‚Äì30 (as in Young Friends General Meeting). The weekends sometimes have a theme, often related to Quaker ideals, which is contemplated through Base Group discussions, the Committee- run sessions and sometimes guest speakers. There is also a significant amount of free time allocated to allow participants to explore the city where the event is held. The tradition of staying up into the early hours of the morning, or not even sleeping at all, is embraced by the majority of the participants. JYF has evolved a number of in-jokes and other traditions (including the love of Milk & Toast and peppermint tea) which appear quite odd to those who have little experience of the young Quaker culture. There are also a number of JYF groups worldwide.  History  Historically, there were JYF groups throughout Britain, but a number of circumstances led to their closure, to the point that the Warwickshire Junior Young Friends is the last surviving one.

He also won consecutive bronze medals in the 100 m breaststroke at the 1980 Olympics and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The son of prominent Western Australian businessman and politician Max Evans, Evans had a late start to his swimming career, making his debut at the Australian Championships in his hometown of Perth, aged 17. Despite placing second in the 100 m breaststroke, he was not selected for Australia, and instead travelled to the United Kingdom to train under David Haller. During this period, he quickly improved his times and rose from outside the top 200 into the top 25 in the world rankings. Evans returned to Australia in 1980 and qualified for the Olympics in both the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke. A sprinter, he won the 100 m in an Australian record time and showed a preference for shorter events, which required less training mileage. Evans gained a reputation for often doing fewer training laps than his coach asked of him. Having rebuffed Australian government pressure to boycott the Moscow Olympics in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Evans won bronze in the 100 m breaststroke. His career peak came in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay, when he outsplit his opponents in the breaststroke leg of the relay, bringing Australia into contention for its eventual win, which remains the only time that the United States has not won the event at Olympic level. After the Olympics, Evans moved to the United States to study business and compete for the University of Arizona. He was less successful in the short-course format used at college level, which placed more reliance on efficient turns. Evans returned to Australia for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, winning silver in the 100 m breaststroke and gold in the medley relay. He competed in his second Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984, winning bronze in both the 100 m breaststroke and the medley relay. Evans retired after missing selection for the 1986 Commonwealth Games and attempted to follow his father into politics. He unsuccessfully stood as the candidate for the Liberal Party of Australia in the electoral district of Perth at the 1986 state election, before pursuing a career in business.  Early years  The second of four children, Evans was born into an affluent family in Perth, Western Australia. His father Max was a chartered accountant who went on to become a politician for the Liberal Party in the state's Upper House. Max was the president of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a senior partner in the accounting firm founded by Sir Charles Court, then premier of Western Australia,Howell, p. 241. who was credited with modernising the state and transforming its lucrative mining industry. Max was an honorary member of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. The Evans family had a sporting pedigree. Max had been a state champion athletics sprinter at youth level and won a gold, a silver and three bronze medals as part of Western Australian relay teams at the Australian Championships. Evans' mother Barbara, a physiotherapist, was a capable swimmer and won a half-blue in netball at the University of Western Australia. Evans attended the exclusive Scotch College in Perth for his entire primary and high school years. He was initially a self-taught swimmer, having observed his father in the water. He recalled that \\"As I didn't like to get up early, I didn't get swim instruction until my sixth grade at Scotch College\\". Evans later trained and competed for the school swimming team in summer as well as the field hockey team. Evans enjoyed success in all four strokes at school level, but was most proficient at breaststroke and chose to specialise in it, commenting that \\"I'd rather be good at one stroke than mediocre in four\\". Thereafter, he was undefeated in breaststroke at school level. Evans learned the \\"whip kick\\" from Ian Dickson, brother of Olympic freestyle swimming medallist David Dickson. Evans later honed his endurance ability under Kevin Duff and his sprinting ability under Bernie Mulroy.  National debut  In November 1978, Evans broke the Western Australian record for the 100 m breaststroke during his final year at school. He and his father decided that he should step up his swimming career, and Evans entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only four weeks of solid training leading up to the meet, Evans came second to Lindsay Spencer. Evans was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, Evans vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, Evans travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. Evans did so feeling that there was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. In three months of training in London, Evans had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training. Evans returned to Australia in 1980 to compete at the Australian Championships, which doubled as the Olympic trials. His sojourn in the United Kingdom meant that he was a virtual unknown in his home country. He set a national record in winning the 100 m breaststroke in a time of 1 m 4.80 s and also qualified for his less preferred 200 m event. During the Olympic training camp in Brisbane, the Australian coaches tried to get Evans to cover more mileage at training. Evans' teammates recalled him stopping during a pool session and emphatically proclaiming that \\"Work is a poor substitute for talent\\". In 2000, more than a decade after his retirement, he was still using this slogan.Forrest, pp. 241‚Äì242. Evans was confident in his own training methods and refused to bend to the coaches. His teammate Mark Tonelli said that Evans \\"knew what he was capable of and as far as he was concerned, he was capable of anything\\".Tonelli, p. 8.  1980 Moscow Olympics  Having qualified to swim for Australia, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western world, led by the United States. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Evans' relay teammate Tonelli believed that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete and publicise their cause among the Australian public.Howell, p. 249.Gordon, p. 334. Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's campaign, reflecting that \\"We were political tools, and the only ones to suffer would be us.\\" He rhetorically asked: \\"Do you really think that if we didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the back for not going?\\"Howell, p. 242. Having arrived in Moscow, Evans' first event was the 100 m breaststroke, which the Soviets were favoured to win. Evans' former flat-mate and training partner Goodhew was another of the favourites. Evans placed equal first in his heat and advanced to the final as the fourth-fastest qualifier, along with Goodhew, two Soviets and fellow Australian Spencer. In a hard-fought final, Goodhew won the gold medal, while Evans narrowly missed out on silver, finishing 0.14 s behind the Soviet Union's Arsens Miskarovs to claim bronze in a time of 1 m 3.96 s. Evans was just 0.04 s ahead of Aleksandr Fyodorovsky, another swimmer from the host nation. Reflecting on the race, Evans felt that his lack of experience compared with Goodhew was a factor in his loss. Evans felt that Goodhew had \\"psyched [him] out\\". Evans was less successful in the 200 m‚Äînot his preferred distance. He came fourth in his heat in a time of 2 m 26.62 s, which saw him eliminated with the 12th-fastest time, some three seconds slower than what was needed to make the final.Howell, p. 243.  Relay victory  The 4 √ó 100 m medley relay was the focal point of Evans' Moscow campaign. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level in 1960, and their boycott had opened up the field in the event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success, and the 1972 medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia was regarded as a medal chance, but were not seen as the main threats‚ÄîSweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most favoured teams to win. The hosts' team included the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth. Later, their freestyler placed fourth. The British had Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100 m.Howell, p. 233. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Neil Brooks, the freestyler, would come 14th overall after an asthma attack, and Evans was the only individual medallist in the corresponding individual event.Andrews, p. 148. Mark Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer.Howell, p. 234. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia had won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win one in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since Munich in 1972.Gordon, p. 333. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the 13 competing countries.Forrest, p. 212. Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Evans took the opportunity to attempt to regain the psychological ascendancy from Goodhew, confronting him privately and stating that \\"we will win it\\". Evans felt that his posturing had shaken Goodhew. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race. Kerry led off in a faster time than he had clocked in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87 s, leaving Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s to put Australia in second place, almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Evans had out-split Goodhew by 0.8 s and Miskarov by 0.5 s. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster than he had ever done before. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then performed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25 m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his teammates.Andrews, p. 63. The time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first-ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed at the poolside. Evans said that the relay \\"was unbelievable, but it was all so logical. I was so deliriously happy that I couldn't stop talking.\\"Andrews, pp. 440‚Äì441. Upon returning to Australia, Evans and Brooks were raucously received in their hometown of Perth. They were denied a civic reception by the Lord Mayor of the City of Perth, who supported an Olympic boycott over Afghanistan, but the Lord Mayor of Fremantle instead hosted a reception. Evans received congratulations from Prime Minister Fraser. In 2000, Evans quipped that \\"We're the Vietnam vets of the Olympic movement\\". In the same year, Evans and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.  US college career  A few weeks before the Olympics, Evans had signed a deal with the University of Arizona, and he went there to study and swim after the Olympics. Evans was to spend five years in Arizona studying for a BA in business. He regarded his American experience as a crucial component of his development: \\"I got a good education, but above all I learned about myself\\". The American laissez faire attitude‚Äîwhich revolved around the individual's self-determination‚Äîsat well with Evans' outlook on life. He often clashed with Arizona swimming coach Dick Jochums, who was regarded as a hard taskmaster. The pair clashed over the training regime; Jochums insisted that Evans increase his mileage, something that the student strongly resisted. Evans was an All-American for four years, but he struggled in the short-course pools used in the college system. Short- course pools‚Äîwhich are only half the length‚Äîplace more emphasis on a swimmer's turning ability, which was the Australian's weakness. Despite his ranking as third in the world at the Olympics, which are swum in long-course pools, Evans was ranked only fifth in the college system. The Australian Swimming Union (ASU) did not recognise times that had been recorded in short-course pools in the United States, so Evans was forced to return for the Australian Championships to qualify for the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane. Despite winning neither of the breaststroke events, Evans successfully earned selection and lined up at the Commonwealth Games in the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke and the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay. In his favoured 100 m event, Evans won bronze, having been led home by Adrian Moorhouse of England and Canada's Victor Davis. In the 200 m event, Evans came fourth, almost four seconds behind the victorious Davis. He then combined with David Orbell, Jon Sieben and Brooks to win the medley relay in a Commonwealth Games record time. Canada reached the wall far ahead of Australia, but were disqualified for a premature changeover.  International farewell  After the games, Evans returned to the United States to continue his studies and collegiate swimming career. Before the 1984 Olympics, Evans travelled to Hong Kong to train with Haller, who was coaching the British colony's swimming team. Evans revitalised himself under his favourite coach and returned to his old style of sprinting. He twisted his ankle later in Perth and missed some training time. He won the Australian 100 m breaststroke championship to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and returned to Arizona to continue training. His Olympic campaign was placed in jeopardy when the ASU threatened to remove Evans from the team for skipping their training camp in Australia. The threat was withdrawn after Evans' father confronted the ASU and pointed out that his son was training, although in a different location. Before the Games, Evans joined the Australians for their final training camp at Stanford University in California. Evans arrived in Los Angeles with the same program as in Moscow; he entered both breaststroke events and the medley relay. Evans started brightly to win his heat of the 100 m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1 m 2.87 s. His new mark did not last long‚ÄîJohn Moffet broke it in a later heat to relegate Evans to the second-fastest qualifying time. Nevertheless, their opponents were able to lift and the final saw Steve Lundquist of the United States set a new world record of 1 m 1.65 s; Evans took bronze, 0.98 s behind silver medallist Davis. Evans was unable to maintain the pace that he had set in the heats, clocking a time 0.10 s slower. In the 200 m, Evans came second in his heat but was not fast enough to make the final, swimming 1.47 s slower than the slowest qualifier to finish 17th. The final event for Evans was the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay. Evans was joined by Kerry, while Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell swum the butterfly and freestyle respectively. The Americans were overwhelming favourites, boasting the gold medallists in three of the respective individual events. The hosts easily won the gold by almost four seconds; Evans and the Australians were third, relegated from the silver medal by just 0.02 s by the Canadian team, having been in the bronze medal position at every change.Gordon, p. 356. Evans recorded the second-fastest breaststroke split, slower than Lundquist, but quicker than the rest, including Davis. After the Olympics, Evans returned to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, he attempted to qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. Evans later stated that he felt his admission of having only trained for ten days had lowered his standing in the eyes of the selectors. As a result of being overlooked, Evans retired from competitive swimming.  Later life  In early 1986, Evans won preselection for the Liberal Party in the electoral district of Perth. He contested the seat in the state election, but lost despite a four percent swing against the Australian Labor Party. Evans then travelled around the world studying international market systems, before working in fund management and international investment. He said of his swimming career: \\"It's not that serious. It's only a race. There's a lot more to be happy and proud for and proud of.\\"Howell, p. 243.

Anastopoulo is known on the court show by nickname Judge \\"Extreme Akim\\". The nickname was meant to characterize the \\"judge's\\" severe and eccentric sentences dispensed to guilty parties on the program, known as \\"paybacks\\". Being that it was a pseudo-court show in an era in which most court programming used an arbitration-based reality format, Eye for an Eye was a nontraditional series within the judicial genre. This, however, was only one of many reasons as to why the highly unconventional series was considered a nontraditional court show, the program having adopted many maneuvers that were atypical to the traditional present court shows.http://www.eyeforaneyetv.com/ Taped at a studio in Dallas, Texas, the courtroom series aired dailyhttp://www.eyeforaneyetv.com/ and ran in first-run syndication from 2003 through 2009. The court show had a total of 5 seasons Judge Extreme Akim Eye For an Eye was \\"presided\\" over by zany, outlandish, and harshly teasing Judge Extreme Akim. Judge Extreme Akim's was notorious for his draconian punishments. He literally attempted to make \\"paybacks\\" fit the crime. As his paybacks were exceedingly harsh and out of the ordinary, however, they often went beyond fitting the crime. As examples of the unusual rulings issued by Judge Akim, a man who impregnated a girl was ordered to wear a fatsuit for a month; a landlord whose apartments were not suitable for living was ordered to write a new policy while sitting in a truck filled with cow manure; etc. At the end of each hearing, Extreme Akim says \\"Now THAT'S justice.\\" Akim \\"The Strongarm\\" Anastopoulo was, at the time of the series debut, a personal injury lawyer who had been practicing law in his hometown of Charleston, South Carolina since 1986. Show format The program was unusual among courtroom shows for its crudeness and lack of courtroom decorum: When Big Sugar Ray Phillips instructed the audience to rise for Judge Akim's entrance, the audience rose all awhile cheering and chanting \\"Extreme Akim\\" repeatedly. They were frequently heard in a state of frenzy throughout the course of the hearings, blurting out remarks in unison. Not one to restore order in his courtroom, Extreme Akim's hearings were tumultuous, chaotic, and uncontrolled with the litigants, the audience, as well as the judge himself all hooting and hollering at the same time, giving the show an environment similar to early tabloid talk shows such as Hot Seat with Wally George or The Richard Bey Show. While Extreme Akim tended to allow courtroom misconduct, interruptions, and disrespect from seemingly everyone before him, he did occasionally attempt to bring the parties to order, especially if they were the party he perceived as guilty. This was usually done in an albeit only teasing, still harsh manner. Plaintiffs and defendants presented their testimonies in ring-shaped \\"cages\\" that had microphones attached inside. Witnesses were instructed to enter the cages if they wished to speak. In lieu of the traditional judge's gavel, Extreme Akim wielded a baseball bat embossed with the word \\"justice.\\" The end of each hearing featured the payback segment, the show following its litigants as they served their sentence. As result, the courtroom was not the only setting of the program. According to the show, the reason for the extreme nature of the sentencing was because the America's justice system was hopeless and unfair. For this reason, the series followed the \\"eye for an eye\\" system. For cases with simple cash judgments, an ATM was located in the courtroom, allowing for judgments to be paid out immediately and on-camera. Despite the program's name though, the disputes were limited to the general civil property and tenant disputes of the genre with the litigants giving up their rights to the show using the binding arbitration format, and the show did not take cases where physical violence took place between the litigants, nor were verdicts involving physical violence against a subject rendered. Supporting roles The bailiff on the series was former boxer Big Sugar Ray Phillips. The series was formerly hosted by Cheaters host Tommy Habeeb and Kato Kaelin. The medical examiner role was played by Martin Crockett.

It is about a turbulent day in the life of an impoverished student in Imperial Vienna. The commission of a desperate crime at the beginning of the novel triggers a chain reaction during which the protagonist is thrown into a series of grotesque situations while all around him people carry on with their normal lives without noticing anything out of the ordinary. Originally serialized in various newspapers in Prague, Vienna, and Berlin, From Nine to Nine became a very popular book and was translated into eight languages during the 1920s. In 1922 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the film rights, but the movie was never made. Plot summary Stanislaus Demba, an honest, well-intentioned student with little money at his disposal, is desperately in love with Sonja Hartmann, an office girl easily impressed by young men with money--a superficial young woman who, by common consent, is not worthy of his love and adoration. When Demba learns that Sonja is about to go on a holiday with another man, he tries to sell some valuable old library tomes which he has borrowed but never returned to a shady antiques dealer so that he can offer Sonja a more expensive trip. The prospective buyer of the books, however, calls the police, and Demba is arrested. While he is being handcuffed Demba jumps out of an attic window and makes his escape. It is nine o'clock in the morning, and Demba embarks on his odyssey by furtively wandering around the streets of Vienna while hiding his handcuffed hands under his overcoat. His two immediate aims now are (a) to get rid of his handcuffs by some means or other without being caught by the police and (b) to raise the money necessary for a trip to, say, Venice, Italy. People who realize that he is unwilling to show his hands either believe he is some kind of freak with a deformity or a dangerous criminal carrying a pistol. Throughout the first part of the novel, Demba repeatedly refers to \\"his hands being tied\\", but everyone--including the majority of readers--assumes that he is speaking metaphorically. There is a twist ending to the novel.

It is a grade II listed building. The tower was built in the 1890s to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the journey of John Cabot from Bristol to land which later became Canada. Public access to the viewing platforms at the top of the tower was suspended from 2007 to 2011 for repairs. History The site of the tower was occupied in the Middle Ages by a chapel which may have belonged to St James' Priory. During the 16th century the chapel was replaced by a windmill. The tower was constructed in memory of John Cabot, 400 years after he set sail in Matthew from Bristol and landed in what was later to become Canada. It was paid for by public subscription. The foundation stone was laid on 24 June 1897 by the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava and the tower was completed in July 1898. The architect was William Venn Gough and it was built by Love and Waite of Bristol. A lift was originally planned but never installed. The tower gives its name to the area and Council ward of Cabot. Restoration After closure to the public in 2006, the tower reopened on 16 August 2011 following completion of repair works costing an estimated ¬£420,000 to cracked stonework caused by corroded reinforcing steel, which had made the tower unsafe. The final stage of the restoration was completed in 2014 with the reinstatement of a light flashing \\"Cabot Tower, Brandon Hill, Bristol\\" in Morse code, which had been turned off in 2001 after developing a technical problem. Architecture Aerial video of the tower The tower is high and built from red sandstone with cream Bath Stone for ornamentation and emphasis. It consists of a spiral staircase and two viewing platforms where balconies with wrought iron railings overlook the city, the higher of which is approximately above sea level. The tower is supported by diagonal buttresses and its top by flying buttresses; it is surmounted by an octagonal spirelet topped with a ball finial and a carved winged figure representing commerce. On three sides of the base of the tower are commemorative plaques. They read as follows: > The foundation stone of this tower was laid by the Marquess of Dufferin & > Ava on the 24 June 1897, And the completed tower was opened by the same > nobleman on the 6 September 1898. > W.Howell Davies, Chairman of the executive committee > E.G.Clarke, J.W.Arrowsmith Hon.

Towards the end of its service life, it was developed into the A-17 light bomber. Design and development The Gamma was a further development of the successful Northrop Alpha and shared its predecessor's aerodynamic innovations with wing fillets and multicellular stressed-skin wing construction. Like late Alphas, the fixed landing gear was covered in distinctive aerodynamic spats, and the aircraft introduced a fully enclosed cockpit. Operational history The Polar Star on display at the National Air and Space Museum The Gamma saw fairly limited civilian service as mail planes with Trans World Airlines but had an illustrious career as a flying laboratory and record-breaking aircraft. The US military found the design sufficiently interesting to encourage Northrop to develop it into what eventually became the Northrop A-17 light attack aircraft. Military versions of the Gamma saw combat with Chinese and Spanish Republican air forces.Smith 1986 Twenty Five Gamma 2Es were assembled in China from components provided by Northrop; these were deployed in various attack missions during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, particular against Imperial Japanese naval assets.Eden and Moeng 2002, pp. 74‚Äì77.https://air.mnd.gov.tw/EN/PastCurrent/PastCurrent_Detail.aspx?FID=28&CID;=176&ID;=1324 On June 2, 1933 Frank Hawks flew his Gamma 2A \\"Sky Chief\\" from Los Angeles to New York in a record 13 hours, 26 minutes, and 15 seconds. In 1935, Howard Hughes improved on this time in his modified Gamma 2G making the west-east transcontinental run in 9 hours, 26 minutes, and 10 seconds. The most famous Gamma was the Polar Star. The aircraft was carried via ship and offloaded onto the pack ice in the Ross Sea during Lincoln Ellsworth's 1934 expedition to Antarctica. The Gamma was almost lost when the ice underneath it broke, and had to be returned to the United States for repairs. Polar Stars second assignment to Antarctica in September 1934 was also futile ‚Äî a connecting rod broke and the aircraft had to be returned yet again for repairs. On January 3, 1935, Ellsworth and pilot Bernt Balchen finally flew over Antarctica. On November 23, 1935, Ellsworth and Canadian pilot Herbert Hollick-Kenyon attempted the world's first trans-Antarctic flight from Dundee Island in the Weddell Sea to Little America. The crew made four stops during their journey, in the process becoming the first people ever to visit Western Antarctica. During one stop, a blizzard completely packed the fuselage with snow which took a day to clear out. On December 5, after traveling over 2,400 miles (3,865 km) the aircraft ran out of fuel just 25 miles (40 km) short of the goal. The intrepid crew took six days to travel the remainder of the journey and stayed in the abandoned Richard E. Byrd camp until being found by the Discovery II research vessel on January 15, 1936. Polar Star was later recovered and donated to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.\\"The story of the Polar Star.\\" National Air and Space Museum. Retrieved: June 27, 2013.

Its ZIP code is 17110. History Camp Curtin on the grounds of an agricultural school near Harrisburg at the start of the American Civil War (Harper's Weekly, September 1862). Following the secession of southern states from the United States during late 1860 and early 1861 and the subsequent fall of Fort Sumter to Confederate States Army forces during mid-April 1861, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to protect the nation's capital during what became the beginning of the American Civil War. Almost immediately, the city of Harrisburg was transformed from being the capital city of the second largest state in America to a hub where men from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Wisconsin, and the Regular Army responded to that call and subsequent calls by Lincoln for additional troops because the city was located at the intersection of major railroad hubs and was close enough to make transport of those men to Washington, D.C. and other battle sites relatively quick and easy.\\"Camp Curtin, Harrisburg, PA,\\" in \\"Civil War Trails.\\" Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Tourism Office. In order to process the hundreds of thousands of men who would pass through Harrisburg as Union Army soldiers between April 1861 and early January 1866, leaders of the federal government and state of Pennsylvania immediately established a new military training camp on the grounds of an agricultural school in what is, today, the Uptown area of Harrisburg. Named in honor of Pennsylvania's sitting governor at the time, Andrew Curtin, a close friend of Lincoln's who quickly mobilized the Pennsylvania Reserves in support of Lincoln's call for troops, the camp officially opened on April 18, 1861, and also included a supply depot, hospital and prisoner-of-war camp. Ultimately, more than 300,000 Union Army soldiers passed through Camp Curtin, making it the largest Federal military training camp during the Civil War. At war's end, Camp Curtin was then used as a key mustering-out point for many of those soldiers troops as they made their way back home. It officially closed on November 11, 1865.\\"Camp Curtin, Harrisburg, PA,\\" in \\"Civil War Trails,\\" Pennsylvania Tourism Office.

The church's ediface was then dedicated in July of that same year. Three years later, the building was expanded to accommodate the church's growing membership. Following a devastating fire the next year, a cornerstone for a new building was placed in 1895, followed by dedication ceremonies in September of that same year. By 1915, church members were raising the $38,000 necessary to create a significantly larger facility ‚Äî one which would include a gymnasium, library, locker rooms, and shower baths which would be \\"open to all the young men and women of the community regardless of their religious affiliation\\" with the expectation that it would become \\"a 'social center' rivalling any in the State.\\" The pastor of the church during this phase of its growth was the Rev.

Organized by the Brazilian Confederation of Sports (CBD), it was won by Atl√©tico Mineiro. While the tournament represented the top tier of Brazilian football, its name was \\"Division Extra\\", with \\"First Division\\" instead used by the second-tier tournament (since known as Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B).T√∫nel do Tempo Background During the 1960s, two tournaments were used to pick Brazil's representative at the Copa Libertadores: Ta√ßa Brasil (1959-1968), a single- elimination tournament between the state champions; and Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa (1967-1970), divided in two separate group phases with teams mostly from the states of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. Both tournaments had a format that barely covered the entire country and had regional phases that diminished fan support, leading to dissatisfaction from both the team owners and the Brazilian Confederation of Sports (CBD), who organized the championship. In 1970, the Brazil national football team won the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, becoming the first three-time world champion. Seeing the valorization of Brazilian football, president Em√≠lio M√©dici and the Brazilian media pushed CBD towards a true national tournament. With a format inspired by the European tournaments, the tournament would feature 20 teams. The format of the national tournament was still close to the 1970 Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa, with the state of Cear√° being the only addition to the seven featured in the Robert√£o's final edition. Some of the shunned federation states, led by Goi√°s, even created their own parallel national tournament, the Torneio Integra√ß√£o da CBD. Competition format The season was divided into three phases: *The First Phase saw the twenty teams divided into two groups of ten. Despite being divided into groups, the phase was contested in a single round-robin format, with each team playing the others once. The top six teams in each group advanced to the Second Phase. *The Second Phase saw the twelve qualified teams divided into three groups of four. The teams within each group played each other in a double round-robin format. The top team from each group advanced to the Final Phase. * The Final Phase saw the three team play each other team once. The team with the most points at the end of the round was declared the champion.

It also marked the cinematic debut of the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi. The Road Home was written by author Bao Shi, who adapted the screenplay from his novel, Remembrance. The film was shot immediately after Zhang Yimou's previous film, Not One Less, and was released to strong reviews in China in fall 1999. Plot The Road Home is the story of a country girl and a young teacher falling in love, and the teacher's death many years later that brings their son back from the big city for the funeral. The film begins in black and white in present-day China when the son (Sun Honglei) returns to his village from the city upon hearing of his father's death. His mother, Zhao Di (Zhao Yulian), insists upon following the tradition of carrying the coffin back to their remote village by foot so that her husband's spirit will remember its way home. As the narrator, the son recounts the story of his parents' courtship, so famous that it has gained the status of a legend in the village. It is here the bleak black and white turns into vivid colors as the story shifts to the past. His father, Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao), came to the village as the teacher. Immediately, Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi) became infatuated with him and he with her. Thus began a courtship which consisted mostly of the exchange of looks and glances between the two. Unfortunately, the courtship was interrupted when Luo was summoned by the government to return to the city. (Several reviewers have speculated that the flashback portion of the film is set during the Anti-Rightist Campaign and that Luo's recall was for investigation and questioning.) Zhao Di's heart was broken; she insisted on waiting for him in the snow and fell so ill that the villagers thought she would die. However, upon hearing news of her illness, the teacher was able to sneak back to the village and Zhao Di, in tears, welcomed the sight of her beloved. Still, their love would not be consummated for a few years more because the teacher was kept away from the village as punishment for having left his assignment in the city without permission. Returning to the present day, and black and white, the son realizes how important this ritual of carrying the coffin back to village is to his mother, Zhao Di, and he agrees to make all necessary arrangements to fulfill her wish. He is told by the mayor of the village that it might be difficult to find enough porters to carry the father home, as there are few young able men left in the village. The mayor and the son reach an agreement on the price to be paid to the porters. But when the procession sets out, more than 100 people show up to help carry home the casket of the man who was their teacher through various generations in the village. The mayor returns the money to the son, as no one will accept payment for doing what they consider to be an honor rather than a task. On the morning of the day the son leaves to return to his job in the city, he fulfills his father's dream and teaches a class in the old schoolhouse that was central to his parents having fallen in love, using the textbook his father had written himself. Cast * Zhang Ziyi as the young Zhao Di, the protagonist in the middle segment of the film. * Zhao Yulian as the old Zhao Di, in the beginning and ending segments. * Zheng Hao as Luo Changyu, a young teacher sent from the city, Zhao Di's husband and the narrator's father. * Sun Honglei as Luo Yusheng, Zhao Di and Luo Changyu's grown son and the film's narrator, who returns to his home village to bury his father. * Li Bin as Grandmother, Zhao Di's elderly mother and the narrator's grandmother. Reception The Road Home received positive reviews. It won two awards at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival: the Jury Grand Prix (second best film) and Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film achieved an approval rating of 89% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

The company calls such a system \\"clean capitalism\\". Founded in 2002, Corporate Knights has a media and research division, which includes the award-winning sustainable business magazine Corporate Knights, and a research division which produces corporate rankings, research reports and financial product ratings based on corporate sustainability performance. Its best-known rankings include the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada and the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations. In June 2013, Corporate Knights was named \\"Magazine of the Year\\" by Canada's National Magazine Awards Foundation.

Links to external studies Prioritizing Global Reporting Initiative Indicators The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) created the G3 sustainability reporting guidelines as well as 14 sector- specific supplements. GRI identified these barriers to sustainable investing that must be overcome: *1. Lack of prioritization: When investors calculate ROI there are hundreds of indicators not deemed financially significant and if there's limited disclosure anyhow, investors naturally shy from the challenge. *2. Data doubts: Consensus on ESG factors is hard to come by and even when it is approached there can be uncertainty about sources, limitations and characteristics of available data. *3. Lack of guidance on how to integrate ESG metrics into standard valuation models: There isn't yet a default model of using ESG data once it is collected and ratified by the investor.EMC- GRI Index G3.1 is GRI's most recent iteration of its Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.Global Reporting- G3.1 Guidelines In 2010, the Prince of Wales' Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) and the Global Reporting Initiative announced the formation of the International Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC).

In addition, it is intended that by 2025 the original route eastwards will be restored as far as Bletchley allowing services to run to Bedford.Transport Secretary officially launches East West Railway Company at Bletchley Park East West Rail, 22 November 2017 This East West Rail project includes a long term plan to re-establish the route through to . History=Opening and original operation The line was opened in 1850 as part of the Buckinghamshire Railway, which in 1879 became part of the London and North Western Railway. In the grouping of Britain's railways in 1923 the L&NWR; became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and in the nationalisation of Britain's railways in 1948 the LMS became part of British Railways. Both the LMS and BR ran passenger services between Oxford and Cambridge via the Buckinghamshire Railway, Marston Vale line and Bedford and Cambridge Railway. This led to the Oxford - Cambridge route being informally called the Varsity line. 20th-century closure and reopening In 1967 British Railways withdrew Oxford - Cambridge services and closed the section of line between Oxford and Bletchley. In 1987 Network SouthEast restored passenger services on the Oxford - Bicester Village Station section on the initiative of Oxfordshire County Council. In 1988, Network SouthEast rebuilt and reopened Islip station, again with Oxfordshire County Council support. Since 2005, an enhanced service including Sunday services has run during the weeks before Christmas, mainly for the Bicester Village Shopping Centre adjacent to Bicester Village Station (formerly Bicester Town station). An enhanced service was operated on the weekend of 12 and 13 May 2007 to celebrate the 20th anniversary since the section of line reopened. In May 2009, a partnership between First Great Western and Oxfordshire County Council rebranded and relaunched the line as The Bicester Link. On 22 May 2011, Chiltern Railways took over all passenger operations on the line. The line closed for upgrades in February 2014, instead running a replacement bus service about 15 times a day. Evergreen 3 In August 2008 Chiltern Railways announced Project Evergreen 3 to create a new passenger service between Oxford and London Marylebone via High Wycombe by 2012. As part of this project Chiltern Railways would double most of the line, build a new passenger station at Water Eaton to serve Kidlington and north Oxford and build the short 'missing-link' from Bicester Town (now ), station to the Chiltern Main Line. This was to give Oxford an alternative to Great Western Railway's rail link to London Paddington and provide Oxford with a direct rail-link to High Wycombe for the first time since British Railways closed the Princes Risborough - Oxford section of the Wycombe Railway in 1964.New rail link is capital idea Oxford Mail Work on Evergreen 3 commenced with the closing of the line in February 2014. The works included complete reconstruction of the line to modern standards, with new track, signalling and bridges, and the infrastructure improvements ready for 'East West Rail' services (see below). The line was double tracked from Oxford North Junction to Bicester South Junction, upgraded for operation and prepared for electrification. Between Oxford station and Oxford North Junction the line uses the former 'Jericho' line, bi-directionally. A new 1 km chord has also been built at Bicester (from Bicester Gavray Junction, linking with the Chiltern main line at Bicester South Junction) and 37 level crossings have been eliminated. Chiltern Railways commenced driver training on the upgraded line in September 2015, and the line between the new Oxford Parkway and Bicester Village stations reopened on 26 October 2015,Chiltern Railway's restores direct trains from High Wycombe to Oxford Chiltern Railways (Press Release) with two trains per hour running between London Marylebone and Oxford Parkway. It was originally planned these would be extended to Oxford in March 2016, but services to Oxford started on 11 December 2016. Planning permission for the work at Oxford Station allowing the new platforms to be constructed was given on 1 December 2015. Current services Chiltern Railways reopened the line between the new Oxford Parkway station and Bicester on 26 October 2015. The timetable for December 2015 to May 2016 has two trains per hour between Oxford Parkway and London Marylebone, all of which stop at Bicester Village but only a few at Islip.Winter and Spring train times (pdf)Chilterns Railways, December 2015 The fastest trains are scheduled to take just under an hour for the whole journey. Services along the full lengths of the line from Oxford started on 11 December 2016. (The service received its ceremonial opening on the following day.) Chiltern Railways originally proposed that the journey from Oxford to London Marylebone would take 66 minutes. Future Class 165 DMU leaves Wolvercote Tunnel, heading towards Oxford. In addition to allowing new services between Oxford and London via the Chiltern route, the Evergreen 3 project formed the first phase of the \\"East West Rail\\" project that is to see a new service linking Oxford with Milton Keynes, Bedford and possibly also Cambridge.MK rail link plan on track The Oxford Times The western section of this route, between Oxford and Bedford, was approved by the Government in November 2011.East West Rail could be running by 2017 Accessed 14 December 2011 In his budget of November 2017, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, allocated further funding to open the western section by 2024 via a new company, the East West Railway Company, which was established in December 2017.Transport Secretary officially launches East West Railway Company at Bletchley Park East West Rail, 22 November 2017 ReferencesGallery File:Islip station Mk 1 (10).pngAn FGW Class 165 Networker Turbo leaving Islip Station in 2010.

Originating as a drawing school in 1746, many of the most important Irish artists, designers and art educators have studied or taught in the college. NCAD has always been located in central Dublin, and in 1980 it relocated to the historic Liberties area. The College has around 950 full-time students and a further 600 pursuing part- time courses, and NCAD's students come from more than forty countries. NCAD is a Recognised College of University College Dublin. It is also a member of the European League of Institutes of the Arts. History=Overview The National College of Art and Design can trace its origins in an unbroken line back to the drawing school set up by Robert West in George's Lane, in 1746, and then sponsored by the Dublin Society. The institution has been influenced in turn by the French Enlightenment, the Victorian schools of design, including industrial design, the Arts and Crafts movement, the search for Irish national identity and innovations in British art education in the 1960s. The school has also played a role in Irish social and cultural developments - it had a significant influence on the eighteenth century Irish school of painting and sculpture and it also affected the standard of applied ornament in architecture and crafts. Most Irish artists of importance have spent some time in the college, and in the twentieth century the teaching staff has included Sir William Orpen, Oliver Sheppard, Oswald Reeves, Harry Clarke, Se√°n Keating, Maurice MacGonigal, Laurence Campbell and Bernardus Romein. The opening up of Irish culture in the 1960s had a profound effect on the college, resulting in years of student disturbances and closures by the government. Central to this was the debate about Modernism versus traditional discipline and the control exercised by the Department of Education and its predecessors. There was also the pressure for industrial design reform in face of the new economic future of an independent Ireland, and again within the Common Market. The consequence of all this revolution was a statute of 1971 which re- established the college, granting it freedom to run its own affairs academically. The college was further restructured in 1975 and a wide range of degree courses developed. Following its relocation to Thomas Street in the early 1980s, the college expanded its offer of undergraduate courses and introduced a range of postgraduate courses and research based options up to PhD level. TimelineThe early years= * 1746: The Dublin Society (subsequently the Royal Dublin Society) decided to subsidise Robert West's Drawing School in George's Lane (later Georges Street) by means of student premiums. * 1750: the Dublin Society set aside rooms for a drawing school at their premises in Shaw's Court off Dame Street - the stables there were converted into drawing schools. West was the Master of the Figure School and James Marrin was the Master of the Landscape and Ornamental School. Later Thomas Ivory was Master of the Architectural School. Throughout the 18th century, the Dublin Parliament gave an annual grant to the Dublin Society, which included support for the school. In fact this was the only state supported school in Great Britain and Ireland. The Society awarded prizes and medals to the best students annually, as well as to the Irish artistic community at large. * 1767: the Society moved to a new building in Grafton Street, to which the Drawing Schools were moved later from Shaw's Court. * 1796: The Society and its Schools were established in Hawkins Street. =After the Act of Union= * 1800: From this year the State subsidy began to come from the United Kingdom parliament at Westminster. This led to a great deal of ongoing friction with the Treasury and other branches of government in London, as the Westminster establishment was much less sympathetic to the Society and its work and sought to centralise direct control from London. * 1811: A fourth school ‚Äî in addition to Figure Drawing, Landscape & Ornamental Drawing, and Architectural Drawing ‚Äî was added: the School of Modelling, to which the eminent Irish sculptor Edward Smyth was appointed as Head. All Schools, with the exception of the School of Modelling, offered only drawing ‚Äî no painting. The method of teaching was by means of drawing the nude model, the antique, copying prints and drawings. The training in drawing ornamental patterns was a key element, becoming the chief element after 1854. * 1815: The Society moved to Leinster House on Kildare Street and shortly afterwards converted stables for use as a drawing school. The stables were on a site later used by the National Library. * 1820: The Dublin Society became the Royal Dublin Society. * 1827: Permanent drawing schools were built beside Leinster House together with the gallery overhead which was used to exhibit the Society's teaching collection of sculpture and works of art generally. The schools were below, in the basement. =London oversight= * 1849: The Board of Trade in London took control of the School as a school of design (for industry) and gave it a direct vote of funding, which was managed by the Royal Dublin Society. * 1854: Control of the School now passed to the newly established Department of Science and Art, based in South Kensington, London. The School was made to conform to the new London syllabus emphasising design education. Fine art education in the later 19th century in Ireland was the province of the Royal Hibernian Academy. =State institution= * 1877: The School was bought out from the Royal Dublin Society by the British Government and becomes the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, a school wholly centrally- supported through the Department of Science and Art, dealing locally with the Director of Science and Art in Dublin, who was also responsible for the Library and Museum and certain other institutions. During the late 19th century design for lace was promoted in the School as well as throughout Ireland. =Dublin oversight= * 1900: Control passed to the newly- established Irish Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, established by Horace Plunkett and based on Merrion Street, albeit with the funding vote still coming from the Treasury in London. Major reforms were introduced before the Great War, notably the development of craft classes, particularly in stained glass (students included Harry Clarke, Michael Healy and Wilhelmina Geddes), enamels and metalwork, as well as life classes taught by William Orpen. * 1914: From this date onward the school experienced difficulties in terms of resources, which subsequent political instability only increased. * 1924: The Department of Education of the independent Irish state took over the control of the Metropolitan School of Art. =National College of Art= * 1936: The Metropolitan School of Art became the National College of Art, with professorships of Design, Painting, and Sculpture. Weaving and Ceramics departments were subsequently added. * 1969: After a series of adverse reports asking for reform at the College, a crisis situation developed leading to periodic closures of the School by the Government. =National College of Art and Design= * 1971: The National College of Art and Design Act was passed by the Oireachtas - it was to be governed by a board (An Bord) appointed by the Minister for Education. * 1972: May 1 was the establishment day of the National College of Art and Design (Col√°iste N√°isi√∫nta Ela√≠ne is Deartha). * 1974: Jonah Jones was appointed Director. * 1975: The Faculty structure was adopted: Faculty of Fine Art (with departments of Painting, Printmaking, Sculpture); Faculty of Design (with departments of Craft, Fashion and Textiles, Industrial Design, Visual Communications); Faculty of History of Art and Design and Complementary Studies; Faculty of Education and Extra Mural Studies; Department of Pre-Diploma Studies (First year common course). * 1976: NCAD received designation under the Higher Education Authority. =Thomas Street= * 1980: Noel Sheridan was appointed Director. Purchase of Powers Distillery premises at Thomas Street. Department of Visual Communication moved into the new buildings, with other departments moving to the campus over subsequent years. Degrees awarded for the first time. * 1984: Degree courses in Visual Communication and Industrial Design validated by the National Council for Education Awards with the designation Bachelor of Design (B Des). * 1985: Degree courses in Fine Art, and in History of Art with Fine Art validated by the NCEA with the designation of BA. * 1988: First MA Degree awarded. First Honorary ANCAD awarded. * 1989: Noel Sheridan took a sabbatical to work in Australia, and for stability, a full Director was appointed, Professor John Turpin. * 1994: Noel Sheridan returned as Director. * 1995: December: Commencement of celebrations to mark NCAD's 250th anniversary, with an ecumenical service in Christ Church Cathedral attended by President Mary Robinson. * 1996: NCAD 250 celebrations continued with the publication of Professor John Turpin‚Äôs History of the College and exhibitions of graduate work at a variety of city venues including the RHA Gallagher Gallery. The College became a Recognised College of the National University of Ireland. * 1998: The College vacated the Leinster Lane premises, which it had occupied since 1827, and acquired the old Thomas Street Fire Station, renamed Harry Clarke House and now with lecturing and staff facilities. The new School of Design for Industry was completed and ready (dedicated Design For Industry Building commissioned). The College awarded its first PhD. =NUI College= * 1999: First intake of students under the NUI validation of courses. * 2000: Formal signing ceremony of the College‚Äôs association with the National University of Ireland in January 2000 attended by An Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern, T.D., the Chancellor of the National University of Ireland, Dr Garrett FitzGerald, members of the NUI Senate, the Department of Education and Science, Higher Education Authority and National Council for Educational Awards. * 2001: New courses approved by the NUI: NUI Certificate in Drawing and Visual Investigation; NUI Higher Diploma in Community Arts Education; NUI Diploma in Art Teaching; MA in History of Art and Applied Arts; MA in Virtual Realities. * 2006: Three taught Masters introduced: MA Design History and Material Culture; MA Art in the Digital World; MA Art in the Contemporary World. * 2009: An Bord endorsed the Academic Council‚Äôs decision to move to a 3 year undergraduate degree structure with a progression of continuation to a two year Masters and beyond, a further three year Doctoral/PhD process. * 2009: Opening of NCAD Gallery (with staff room and studio space overhead). * 2010: NCAD entered into dialogue with both TCD and UCD regarding validation of the College‚Äôs awards, and on critical connections that could be developed between each of the institutions. In June 2010 An Bord took the strategic decision to pursue discussions only with UCD with a view to forming a strategic alliance with that university. =UCD College= * 2011: NCAD changed from being a Recognised College of NUI to being a Recognised College of UCD, and NCAD degrees are since then validated by UCD. * 2018: January: Sarah Glennie, former director of IMMA, assumed the Directorship of NCAD Campus For most of its history NCAD was located in Kildare Street, in a series of buildings adjoining the D√°il (Parliament) and the National Library of Ireland. With increasing student numbers and a requirement for additional space by the Dail, the College relocated to the Liberties in the early 1980s, to a site at 100 Thomas Street which was formerly the home of Power's Whiskey Distillery. The six acre campus is located next door to the landmark Church of St Augustine and St John, by Gothic revivalist Edward Welby Pugin (begun 1862) which features stained glass by NCAD graduates, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke (and his studio). The campus comprises a mixture of 19th, 20th and 21st century buildings. The largest of the original Powers Distillery buildings is the five-storey Granary, crowned by a cupola with weather vane bearing the date 1817. Other original buildings utilised by the college include the Counting House and Offices (now housing College Administration), designed by C. W. Caroe (c.1876), the Clock Building, and the Distiller's Residence. Distinguishing features associated with the manufacture of whiskey include three of the original giant pot stills, once enclosed but now located on the periphery of Red Square (part of the original kiln building is now integrated into the Library annex), along with two of the original five engine houses, including the most notable, Engine House No. 5 with its 250 horse power beam engine, and the smaller of the original two chimney stacks. The majority of full-time students have dedicated studio space in either the Granary or in the Design For Industry Building (built 1998). The student caf√©, which was originally Power's staff canteen, is located in the vaulted basement of the Counting House and Offices. In the 1998 the College acquired the old Thomas Street Fire Station, Dublin's first motorised fire station, which was designed by Charles J. McCarthy (1911). Renamed Harry Clarke House, it now houses a lecture theatre, seminar rooms and staff offices. Between it and the Counting House is the modernist NCAD Gallery (with staff room and studio space overhead) which was designed by Murray O'Laoire and opened in 2009. Since 2017 the College campus has featured in Dubline (Dublin Discovery Trail), the self- guided tour which introduces visitors to both the contemporary college and the history of the site and the buildings. Notable Facilities on Campus * The Edward Murphy Library, located in The Granary, is named after the College's long-serving Head Librarian and founder of NIVAL; it has an extensive collection of material relating to 19th, 20th and 21st century art, design and visual culture, and holds almost 100,000 books. * NIVAL (National Irish Visual Arts Library) is located in the Clock Building on the campus and is a public research resource dedicated to the documentation of twentieth and twenty-first century Irish visual art and design. It collects, stores and makes accessible for research an unparalleled collection of documentation about Irish art and design in all media. * The NCAD Gallery is a modernist exhibition space which has an ongoing programme of exhibitions by national and international artists as well as shorter displays of work by current students. * Distillers Press is NCAD's typography and Letterpress printing workshop, located in the Department of Communications Design. The focus of the Press is on education and experimentation in typography and relief-based image making. The press holds a significant collection of printing equipment and wooden and metal type from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. * Origin8 is a centre for commercialisation and innovation, where campus spin-outs work to establish their business and design researchers collaborate with companies across a range of industries.

K≈çans *Ummon inquired of his monks, \\"This world is such a wide world! Why then do you answer to a temple bell and don ceremonial robes?\\" *A monk asked Ummon, \\"What is the Dharma Kaya (the ultimate formless timeless reality)?\\". :Ummon replied: \\"A garden of medicinal flowers.\\" :The monk then said, \\"Is that all I need to understand?\\" :Ummon replied: \\"If that isn't enough, then you'll need to see the mythical Golden-Haired Lion.\\" *A monk once asked Ummon, \\"What is the Dharma Kaya?\\" :Ummon answered: \\"The Six Ungraspables.\\" (The Graspables are the five senses and the mind.) *When Ummon was asked \\"What is the pure Dharmakaya?\\", he replied: \\"The flowering hedge\\" (surrounding the privy). *Ummon Zenji said: \\"Men of immeasurable greatness are tossed about in the ebb and flow of words.\\" *Of the Zen saying: \\"Buddha preached for forty-nine years, but his tongue never moved,\\" the master Gensha said: ::\\"Pious teachers say that Buddhism helps us in every possible way, but think: how can it help the blind, the deaf, or the dumb? The blind cannot see the teacher's staff that is raised before them. The deaf cannot hear the teacher's words, no matter how wise. The dumb cannot ask their questions or speak their understanding. So since we cannot help these people, how can we say Buddhism helps in every possible way? What good is it?\\" ::Many years later a monk asked the master Ummon to explain these words of Gensha. After making the questioner prostrate himself and then rise, Ummon swiped at him with his staff. The monk jumped back. ::\\"Ah-ha!\\" said Ummon, \\"I see you are not blind!\\" Then he told the monk to come forward, which he did. ::\\"Ah-ha!\\" said Ummon, \\"I see you are not deaf!\\" Then he asked the monk if he understood what all this to-do was about. The monk said he did not. \\"Ah-ha!\\" said Ummon, \\"I see you are not dumb!\\" *A Zen student told Ummon- \\"Brilliancy of Buddha illuminates the whole universe.\\" ::Before he finished the phrase, Ummon asked: \\"You are reciting another's poem, are you not?\\" ::\\"Yes\\", answered the student. ::\\"You are sidetracked,\\" said Ummon. ::Afterwards another teacher, Shishin, asked his pupils: \\"At which point did that student go off the track?\\" *Tozan (Ummon's future successor as head of the Ummon school) went to Ummon. Ummon asked him where he came from. Tozan said, \\"From Sato Village.\\" ::Ummon asked: \\"In what temple did you remain for the summer?\\" ::Tozan replied, \\"The temple of Hoji, south of the lake.\\" ::\\"When did you leave there?\\" asked Ummon, wondering how long Tozan would continue with such factual answers. ::\\"The twenty-fifth of August\\", answered Tozan. ::Ummon then said: \\"I should give you three blows, but today I forgive you.\\" ::The next day Tozan bowed to Ummon and asked, \\"Yesterday you forgave me three blows. I do not know why you thought me wrong.\\" Ummon, rebuking Tozan's spiritless responses, said: \\"You are good for nothing! You simply wander from one monastery to another.\\" Before Ummon's words were ended, Tozan was enlightened. *Once Hs√ºeh-f√™ng came before the assembly and said, \\"In a southern mountain, there is a turtle-nosed serpent. You monks must have a good look at this creature.\\" Ch'ang-ch'ing, Y√ºn-m√™n, and Hs√ºan-sha were in the assembly. Ch'ang-ch'ing stepped forward and said: \\"In this hall someone will lose his body and life today.\\" Y√ºn-m√™n threw his staff down in front of Hs√ºeh-f√™ng and made a gesture as of fear at discovering the serpent. Hs√ºan-sha said, \\"Brother Ch'ang-ch'ing's answer has some substance to it. However, I should not say it thus, but ask why we refer to the southern mountain.\\" *Ummon asked the head monk, \\"What sutra are you lecturing on?\\" ::\\"The Nirvana Sutra.\\" ::\\"The Nirvana Sutra has the Four Virtues, hasn't it?\\" ::\\"It has.\\" ::Ummon asked, picking up a cup, \\"How many virtues has this?\\" ::\\"None at all, \\" said the monk. ::\\"But ancient people said it had, didn't they?\\" said Ummon. \\"What do you think of what they said?\\" Ummon struck the cup and asked, \\"You understand?\\" ::\\"No,\\" said the monk. ::\\"Then,\\" said Ummon, \\"You'd better go on with your lectures on the sutra.\\" *Suigan, at the end of the annual summer meditation retreat, said to his monks, \\"The whole summer have I lectured you. Look! Has Suigan any eybrows?\\" Hofuku said: \\"A robber knows in his heart he is a thief.\\" Chokei said, \\"Far from dropping off from too much talking, they have grown longer!\\" But then Ummon forcefully shouted \\"Kan!\\" *Monk: \\"What is the one road of Ummon?\\" ::Ummon: \\"Personal Experience!\\" ::Monk: \\"What is the Way?\\" ::Ummon: \\"Go!\\" ::Monk: \\"What is the road, where is the Way?\\" ::Ummon: \\"Begin walking it!\\" *A monk asked Ummon, \\"What will happen when the leaves fall and the trees become bare?\\" Ummon said, \\"Golden Wind!\\" (or, \\"The trunk is visible in the autumn wind.\\") *Ummon once lived within a temple called the \\"Chapel of Holy Fruits\\". One morning, a government official visited him, and asked him, \\"Are your fruits well-ripened now?\\" \\"None of them has ever been called green\\", replied Ummon. *A travelling monk asked Ummon, \\"What is the teaching given by Gautama Buddha during his lifetime?\\" Ummon replied: \\"The teaching confronts each.\\" *A monk asked Ummon. \\"What would the Shakyamuni Buddha have said if there were no one to hear and no occasion to teach?\\" Ummon answered: \\"The opposite of statement.\\" *One day Ummon stood up and said to his disciples: \\"If you do not see a man for three days, do not think he is the same man. How about you?\\" No one spoke, so he said: \\"One thousand!\\" *A monk asked Ummon, \\"What is the kind of talk that transcends Buddhas and Patriarchs?\\" Ummon replied: \\"Rice cake!\\" *A monk asked Ummon, \\"What is your family tradition?\\" Ummon replied thus: \\"Oh, it looks like students who wish to come to learn are already outside the gate.\\" *A monk asked Ummon, \\"What is Ummon's melody?\\" Ummon replied: \\"The twenty-fifth of December!\\" *A monk asked Ummon, \\"What is the samadhi of each individual thing?\\" Ummon replied: \\"Rice in bowl, water in pail!\\" *A monk asked Ummon, \\"No thoughts have risen. Are there any faults or not?\\" Ummon said: \\"Mount Sumeru!\\" *Said Ummon to his disciples, \\"I do not ask you to say anything about before the fifteenth day of the month, but say something about after the fifteenth day of the month.\\" Because no monk could reply, Ummon answered himself and said, \\"Every day is a good day!\\" *Said Ummon to his disciples, \\"However wonderful a thing is, it may be that it is better not to have it at all.\\" *A monk asked Kenpo, \\"The one road of Nirvana leads into the ten quarters. But where does it begin?\\" Kenpo raised his staff and traced a horizontal line in the air. \\"Here.\\" Disappointed, the monk went to Ummon and asked him the same question. Ummon held up his fan, and said: \\"This fan leaps up to the 33rd heaven and hits the presiding deity on the nose, then it dives down into the Eastern Sea where it hits the holy carp. The carp becomes a dragon which then brings a flood of rain.\\" *One day, while lecturing his monks, Ummon asked them, \\"Do you want to meet the old Patriarchs?\\" Before any of the monks could answer, he pointed his stick above their heads and said, \\"The Patriarchs are jumping on your head!\\" Then he asked, \\"Do you wish to look them in the eye?\\" He pointed to the ground and said: \\"They are all under our feet!\\" After a moment, he spoke to himself, saying: \\"I made a great feast in the joss house, but the hungry gods are never satisfied.\\" *A monk once asked Ummon, \\"What is this place where knowledge is useless?\\" Ummon answered him: \\"Knowledge and emotion cannot fathom it!\\" *Y√ºn-men asked: \\"If a person who is difficult to change should come to you, would you receive him?\\" :The master answered: \\"Ts'ao-shan has no such leisure.\\" :Monk: \\"Where is the place from which all buddhas come?\\" :Yun-men: \\"Next question, please!\\" In popular culture The TV series Fargo makes liberal use of koans.

He also served as a senior officer of the Confederate States Army in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. Chesnut, a lawyer prominent in South Carolina state politics, served as a Democratic senator in 1858-60, where he proved moderate on the slavery question. But on Lincoln's election in 1860, Chesnut resigned from the U.S. Senate and took part in the South Carolina secession convention, later helping to draft the Confederate States Constitution. As aide to General P.G.T. Beauregard, he ordered the firing on Fort Sumter and served at First Manassas. Later he was aide to Jefferson Davis and promoted to Brigadier- General. Chesnut returned to law practice after the war. His wife was Mary Boykin Chesnut, whose published diaries reflect the Chesnuts' busy social life and prominent friends such as John Bell Hood, Louis T. Wigfall, Wade Hampton III, and Jefferson Davis. Early life and education James Chesnut Jr., was born the youngest of fourteen children and the only (surviving) son of James Chesnut Sr. (1775-1866) and his wife, Mary Cox (1777-1864) on Mulberry Plantation near Camden, South Carolina. Chesnut Sr. was one of the wealthiest planters in the South, who owned 448 slaves and many large plantations totaling nearly five square miles before the outbreak of the Civil War. Chesnut Jr. graduated from the law department of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1835, and initially rose to prominence in South Carolina state politics. Political career Admitted to the bar in 1837, Chesnut Jr. commenced practice that year in Camden. He was later elected as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives (1840-52) and the South Carolina Senate (1852-58, serving as its president 1856-58). He was a delegate to the southern convention at Nashville, Tennessee, in 1850. In 1858 Chesnut was elected by the South Carolina Legislature to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat to replace Josiah J. Evans. He served there for two years alongside Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina. Although a defender of slavery and states' rights, Chesnut opposed the re-opening of the African slave trade and was not as staunch a secessionist as most of the South Carolinian politicians. Moderate in his political views, he believed in extending protections for slavery's westward expansion while remaining within the Union. But the political atmosphere tightened towards the Presidential Election of 1860, since the Republican Party and its presidential candidate, Abraham Lincoln, opposed slavery. After the results of the election were known, Chesnut decided that he could no longer stay in his office in the Senate.Scarborough, Masters of the Big House, pp. 277 and 289, Cauthen, South Carolina Goes to War, pp. 49-50, Sinha, The Counterrevolution of the Slavery, pp. 134, 138, 176-7. Shortly after Lincoln's election, he was the first Southern senator to withdraw from the Senate, on November 10, 1860. (He was expelled in absentia from the Senate the next year.) Chesnut participated in the South Carolina secession convention in December 1860 and was subsequently elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He was a member of the committee which drafted the Confederate States Constitution. American Civil War c. 1862 In the spring of 1861, he served as an aide-de-camp to General P.G.T. Beauregard and was sent by the general to demand the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston. After the commander of the fort, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army declined to surrender, Chesnut gave orders to the nearby Fort Johnson to open fire on Fort Sumter. In consequence the first shots of the Civil War were fired, on April 12, 1861.Williams, Beauregard, pp. 57-58. In the summer of 1861 Chesnut also took part in the First Battle of Manassas as an aide-de-camp to Beauregard. In 1862 Chesnut served as a member of the South Carolina's Executive Council and the Chief of the Department of the Military of South Carolina. Later in the war he served the Confederate Army as a colonel and an aide to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In 1864 he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of South Carolina reserve forces until the end of the war. He was third in command of the confederate forces at the Battle of Tulifinny. He was in overall command before the arrival of Maj. Gen. Samuel Jones and later Brig. Gen. Lucius Gartrell. After the war, he returned to the practice of law in Camden and formed the Conservative Party. Personal life Although James Chesnut Jr. was the only son, his father had given him little of his extensive property. Because his father lived to the age of 90 and gave his son but a small allowance, the son James had to live mainly on his law practice. The Chesnut fortune declined in the course of the war and thus, after his father died in 1866, Chesnut inherited little more than the extensive debts that encumbered the Mulberry and Sandy Hill plantations.Muhlenfeld, Mary Boykin Chesnut, passim. Chesnut married seventeen-year-old Mary Boykin Miller (1823-86), on April 23, 1840. She later became well known for her book on life during the Civil War, published as a diary but revised extensively from 1881 to 1886. The daughter of U.S. Senator Stephen Decatur Miller (1788-1838) and Mary Boykin (1804-85), she was well-educated and intelligent and took part in her husband's career. The Chesnuts' marriage was at times stormy due to difference in temperament (she was hot-tempered and passionate and came occasionally to regard her husband as cool and reserved). Their companionship was mostly warm and affectionate but they had no children.Chesnut, Mary Chesnut's Civil War, passim. The couple resided at Chesnut Cottage in Columbia during the Civil War period. As Mary Chesnut described in depth in her diary, the Chesnuts had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the society of the South and the Confederacy. Among their friends were, for example, Confederate general John Bell Hood, ex-Governor John L. Manning, Confederate general and politician John S. Preston and his wife Caroline, Confederate general and politician Wade Hampton III, Confederate politician Clement C. Clay and his wife Virginia, and Confederate general and politician Louis T. Wigfall and his wife Charlotte. The Chesnuts were intimate family friends of President Jefferson Davis and his wife Varina Howell. James Chesnut was also a first cousin of fellow Confederate general Zachariah C. Deas. Death James Chesnut was \\"regarded as an amiable, modest gentleman of decent parts [gifts]\\",Hammond, Secret And Sacred, p. 214. who performed his duties with ability and dignity both in political and military life. He died at home in Camden in 1885; interment was in Chesnut Family Cemetery, Kershaw County, South Carolina.

The policy was focused on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. The Australian Defence Force was tailored to defending Australia rather than developing capabilities to operate outside Australian territory. Development The Defence of Australia (DOA) policy was adopted after the previous policy of \\"forward defence\\" was discredited in the public eye by Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War. The policy was developed during the 1970s and early 1980s before it was formalised in the 1986 Dibb Report and the 1987 and 1994 Defence White Papers. Implications The focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia's northern maritime approaches (the \\"air-sea gap\\") against enemy attack. The ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases, by increasing the size and capabilities of the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy, at the expense of the Army and the forces used to project power overseas (such as Australia's aircraft carrier, HMAS Melbourne, which was retired without replacement). Specific force structure changes introduced under the DOA policy included: * Increasing the number of units based in northern Australia * Raising three Regional Force Surveillance Units * Developing RAAF Base Tindal as an operational fighter base * Developing three 'bare bases' for the RAAF in northern Queensland and Western Australia * Development of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar network * Development of the Collins class submarines Nevertheless, the adoption of the DOA policy did not involve Australia adopting a policy of neutrality or completely disbanding its ability to deploy forces overseas. During the DOA era, Australia maintained its alliances with the United States and New Zealand and sought to develop stronger defence relationships with South East Asian countries. In addition, the ADF maintained a sizeable force of transport aircraft and amphibious ships and an infantry brigade capable of rapidly deploying overseas (the 3rd Brigade). Furthermore, Australian forces continued to be deployed overseas for exercises and peace keeping operations, and a small Australian military base was permanently maintained at Butterworth in Malaysia. Criticisms Most criticisms of the DOA policy focus on the policy's inflexibility. In particular, it is argued that Australia's foreign relations and defence interests require a force capable of rapidly deploying outside Australia. It is also argued that the DOA force structure was not capable of adequately responding to threats other than a direct attack on Australian soil. Furthermore, it is also argued that the DOA policy is unsuitable for coping with the less stable geopolitical conditions since the end of the Cold War, which has seen the Australian Army deployed more often than anticipated under DOA. To a large extent, the Liberal Party government elected in 1996 embraced the criticisms and re-oriented Australian defence policy by placing greater emphasis on the ADF's ability to deploy overseas. This did not, however, represent a return to \\"forward defence\\" as it involved Australian expeditionary forces deploying from bases in Australia, and not the permanent stationing of Australian military units overseas. Furthermore, defending Australia from external attack remained the Australian Defence Force's primary responsibility. East Timor and aftermath The Australian- led intervention in East Timor in 1999 highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the policy. While the enhanced defence infrastructure in northern Australia and high-tech naval and air units played a critical role in the operation, the limited availability of deployable logistic units and infantry constrained the operation, especially in its early days. While the Australian government has expanded the ADF's logistic capability in light of experience, the ADF's force structure remains largely unchanged from that developed during the DOA era. A key reason is that given the long distances which need to be covered to protect northern Australia, the units developed for the Defence of Australia are inherently capable of deploying outside Australia. This has created an emphasis upon a light and mobile land contingent.

The History of the \\"I AM\\" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation. Saint Germain Press 2003 It is an offshoot of theosophy and a major precursor of several New Age religions including the Church Universal and Triumphant. The movement had up to a million followers in 1938 and is still active today on a smaller scale. According to the official website of the parent organization, the Saint Germain Foundation, its worldwide headquarters is located in Schaumburg, Illinois, and there are approximately 300 local groups worldwide under several variations of the names \\"I AM\\" Sanctuary, \\"I AM\\" Temple, and other similar titles. As of 2007, the organization states that its purpose is \\"spiritual, educational and practical,\\" and that no admission fee is charged for their activities. The term \\"I AM\\" is a reference to the ancient Sanskrit mantra \\"So Ham\\", meaning \\"I Am that I Am\\". Overview The movement believes in the existence of a group called the Ascended Masters, a hierarchy of supernatural beings that includes the original Theosophical Masters such as Jesus Christ, El Morya Khan, Maitreya, and in addition several dozen more beyond the original 20 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom of the original Theosophists as described by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. These \\"Ascended Masters\\" are believed to be humans who have lived in a succession of reincarnations in physical bodies or cosmic beings (beings originated from the great central sun of light in the beginning of all times). Over time, those who have passed through various ‚Äúembodiments‚Äù became highly advanced souls, are able to move beyond the cycles of \\"re- embodiments\\" and karma, and attained their \\"Ascension\\", becoming immortal. The Ascended Masters are believed to communicate to humanity through certain trained messengers per Blavatsky, including Guy and Edna Ballard. Because Jesus is believed to be one of the Ascended Masters, making the \\"Christ Light\\" available to seekers who wish to move out of darkness, many of the members of the \\"I AM\\" Activity consider it to be a Christian religion. According to the Los Angeles Magazine, Ballard said he was the re-embodiment of George Washington, an Egyptian priest, and a noted French musician. The \\"I AM\\" Activity was the continuation of the teachings received by H. P. Blavatsky and William Quan Judge. Ballard was always guided and inspired by the writings of William Quan Judge (1851-1896), who used the pseudonym David Lloyd due to the persecution of his enemies in the Theosophical Society. Then Ballard came in contact with the Mahatma called \\"Ascended Master\\" Saint Germain. Ballard died in 1939. In 1942 his wife and son were convicted of fraud,United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944) a conviction which was overturned in a landmark Supreme Court decision (United States v. Ballard), ruling that the question of whether the Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to a jury. This event has been known as the determinant for the establishment of the policies regarding freedom of religion or beliefs rights in the United States of America.  History = Founding  The \\"I AM\\" Activity was founded by Guy Ballard (pseudonym Godfr√© Ray King) in the early 1930s. Ballard was well-read in theosophy and its offshoots, and while hiking on Mount Shasta looking for a rumored branch of the Great White Brotherhood known as \\"The Brotherhood of Mount Shasta\\", he claimed to have met and been instructed by a man who introduced himself as \\"Saint Germain.\\" Saint Germain is regular component of theosophical religions as an Ascended Master, based on the historical Comte de Saint-Germain, an 18th-century adventurer. The Ballards said they began talking to the Ascended Masters regularly. They founded a publishing house, Saint Germain Press, to publish their books and began training people to spread their messages across the United States. These training sessions and \\"Conclaves\\" were held throughout the United States and were open to the general public and free of charge.The Voice of the \\"I AM\\" Number 1, March 1936. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press. page 27 A front- page story in a 1938 edition of the Chicago Herald and Examiner noted that the Ballards \\"do not take up collections or ask for funds\\".Chicago Herald and Examiner October 8, 1938 Some of the original members of I AM were recruited from the ranks of William Dudley Pelley‚Äôs organization the Silver Shirts. Meetings became limited to members only after hecklers began disrupting their open meetings. Over their lifetimes, the Ballard's recorded nearly 4,000 Live dictations, which they said were from the Ascended Masters. Guy Ballard, his wife Edna, and later his son Donald became the sole \\"Accredited Messengers\\" of the Ascended Masters.  Popularity  The Ballards' popularity spread, including up to a million followers in 1938. They accepted donations (called \\"love gifts\\") from their followers across the country, though no such donation or dues were required. The first of many \\"Conclaves\\" held in scores of cities in their national tours was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 10‚Äì19, 1934. According to a Los Angeles Magazine article, in August 1935, the Ballards hosted a gathering at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles that drew a crowd of 6,000. Guy Ballard spoke under the pseudonym he used in authoring his books, Godfre Ray King, and his wife used the pseudonym Lotus. The meeting included teachings they described as being received directly from the Ascended Masters. They led the audience in prayers and affirmations that they called decrees, including adorations to God and invocations for abundance of every good thing, including love, money, peace, and happiness.  Guy Ballard's death  At the height of his popularity, Guy Ballard died from arteriosclerosis at 5:00 A.M. on December 29, 1939, in Los Angeles, in the home of his son Donald. On December 31 his body was cremated. On New Year's Day during the annual Christmas Class, Edna Ballard stated that Guy had completed his Ascension at midnight December 31, 1939, from the \\"Royal Teton Retreat\\". Students of the \\"I Am\\" Activity believe in death as a change, not an ending. The \\"I AM\\" activity believe Ascension can mean Entering heaven alive, that is, to \\"raise one's body\\"‚Äîphysically translating to a higher form of existence, as in the Ascension of Jesus. This is what Guy Ballard had claimed his followers would be able to do if they followed his instructions. Recorded in a dictation prior to Guy W Ballard's death a new dispensation to make the Ascension after the passing of death and cremation was given, and is recorded at the Saint Germain Foundation.\\"War on High\\" -- Interview with Elizabeth Clare Prophet Gnosis magazine No. 21 Fall 1991 Pages 32-37 Students using this more traditional definition would have to conclude that Mrs. Ballard did not tell the full teaching, since Mr. Ballard had died a quite ordinary death and his body had been cremated. There had also been questions raised about devout members who had died without entering heaven alive. At this time, Edna Ballard defined \\"Ascension\\" as dying an ordinary death, but going to a higher level of heaven than a normal person because one has balanced \\"51% of one's karma\\".Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press--\\"Ascension--the Goal of Life\\" Page 51 This modified and more practical definition of \\"ascension\\" is used by all Ascended Master Teachings religions today, although they still believe that a select few, the higher level Ascended Masters such as Jesus and St. Germain, entered heaven alive.  Copyright infringement civil action  In 1941, the Ballards were sued for copyright infringement by the family and estate of Frederick Spencer Oliver (1866-1899), \\"amenuensis\\" of the novel A Dweller on Two Planets, first published in 1905. The suit was dismissed for failure to state cause of action. District Judge Dawkins quoted the original foreword to Oliver's book in its entirety, wherein Oliver emphasized that he was not the author but had channeled the book from the spirit of a previously deceased person with the intent of preserving and conveying the story and teachings of that person's world; and the book had been copyrighted with Oliver as a proprietor, not as the author. Judge Dawkins pointed out that the Ballards had stated they were using similar methods to write their books and that this in itself wasn't enough to uphold the action in court.Oliver v. Saint Germain Foundation, 41 F. Supp. 296 (S.D. Cal. 1941).  Fraud trial of Edna and Donald Ballard  In 1942, Edna Ballard and her son Donald were charged with eighteen counts of mail fraud on the basis of claims made in books sent through the mail. The presiding judge instructed the jury not to consider the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs, but only whether the Ballards sincerely believed the claims or did not, and the jury found them guilty. The Ninth Circuit overturned the conviction on the grounds that the judge improperly excluded the credibility of their religious beliefs from consideration, and the government appealed to the Supreme Court. In United States v. Ballard, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 landmark decision held that the question of whether Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to the jury, and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the fraud conviction. Interpreting this decision, the Ninth Circuit later found that the Court did not go so far as to hold that \\"the validity or veracity of a religious doctrine cannot be inquired into by a Federal Court.\\"Cohen v. United States, 297 F.2d 760 (1962) On a second appeal, the Supreme Court in 1946 vacated the fraud conviction, on the grounds that women were improperly excluded from the jury panel.Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187 (1946)  Relocation to Santa Fe and Edna Ballard's death  In March 1942, Edna Ballard moved the western branch of the Saint Germain Press and her residence to Santa Fe, where she recorded live before an audience thousands more dictations she said were from the Ascended Masters. Despite the ultimate dismissal of the court cases, it was not until 1954 that the organization's right to use the mail was restored. The Internal Revenue Service revoked their tax-exempt status in 1941, stating it did not recognize the movement as \\"a religion\\". A court ruling in 1957 overturned the ruling of the IRS and re- established the group's tax-exempt status.  Recent history and present day  As of 2007, Saint Germain Foundation maintains a reading room in Mount Shasta, California, and its headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois. Several annual conclaves are held at their 12-story \\"I AM Temple\\" at 176 West Washington Street in downtown Chicago. Among the hundreds attending, there are usually dozens of \\"I AM\\" students from other nations. Classes and conclaves are regularly held in approximately 300 locations in America, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. The Saint Germain Press, a subsidiary of the Saint Germain Foundation, publishes the historical books and related artwork and audio recordings of the Ballards' teachings, and a monthly magazine available by subscription, titled \\"The Voice of the 'I AM'\\". It has been estimated that the Saint Germain Press has printed and put into circulation over one million books. The Saint Germain Foundation presents the \\"I AM\\" COME! Pageant every August at Mount Shasta, and has done so each year since 1950. Their website states that the performance is open to the public at no cost, and describes the Pageant as a portrayal of \\"the life of Beloved Jesus, focusing on His Miracles of Truth and Healing, and the example of the Ascension which He left to the world.\\"  Teachings  According to the group's teachings, Ascended Masters are believed to be individuals who have left the reincarnation cycle of re-embodiment. The \\"I AM\\" Activity calls itself Christian, because Jesus is considered to be one of the more important Ascended Masters. It also refers to itself as patriotic because Ascended Master St. Germain is believed to have inspired and guided the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Followers claim that St. Germain belonged to the same Masonic Lodge as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. However, Guy Ballard tended to downplay any relation of his ideas to Freemasonry because of his great discordance with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a famous Freemason. Thus the notion that Saint-Germain belonged to a Masonic Lodge was more part of general occult lore than part of Ballard's emphasis.Folkloric accounts collected in Raymond Bernard's Great Secret Count St Germain (Mokelumne Hill Press, 1993) > The movement teaches that the omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent creator > God ('I AM' ‚Äì Exodus 3:14) is in all of us as a spark from the Divine Flame, > and that we can experience this presence, love, power and light ‚Äì and its > power of the Violet Consuming Flame of Divine Love ‚Äì through quiet > contemplation and by repeating 'affirmations' and 'decrees'. By affirming > something one desires, one may cause it to happen. The group teaches that the \\"Mighty I AM Presence\\" is God existing in and as each person's Higher Self, and that a light known as the \\"Violet Flame\\" is generated by the \\"I AM Presence\\" and may surround each person who calls forth the action of the Holy Spirit for expression of mercy or forgiveness. The group believes that by tapping into these internalized powers in accordance with the teachings of the Ascended Masters, one can use one's relationship to the \\"Presence\\" to amplify the expressions of virtue such as justice, peace, harmony, and love; to displace or abate the expression of evil (relative absence of good) in the world; and to minimize personal difficulties in one's life. The spiritual goal of the teachings is that, through a process of self- purification, the believer may attain the perfected condition of the saints, or become an Ascended Master when leaving their body, contrasted to common concepts of 'ordinary death'. The process of attaining these results includes one or another of interior practices to facilitate resonance and alignment with the \\"I AM Presence\\": self-assessment in light of saintly exemplars such as Jesus, care in the use of language, devotion (to the Divine), gratitude, meditation, invocations and affirmations; and external practices such as \\"decrees\\" (repeated prayers given aloud with conviction), all of which are said to amplify the energetic presence of the divine in one's experience, resulting in the desired positive changes. Members believe there is actual science behind decrees and affirmations and claim these practices are acknowledged by medicine as effective.Your Body Believes Every Word You Say - Barbara Hoberman Levine, Hung By The Tongue - Francis P Martin; Healing Words -Larry Dossey, M.D., 5 Common Words That Create Failure -Geoffrey James The group also emphasizes personal freedom, embracing patriotic symbols, and often displays American flags in its Temples or other offices. These \\"positive thinking\\" beliefs overlap with several other New Age movements such as Religious Science and the Human Potential Movement.

Plot Irene Ware and Bela Lugosi After Jean Thatcher (Ware) has been injured in a car accident, her father, Judge Thatcher (Hinds) and beau Jerry (Matthews) implore retired surgeon Dr. Richard Vollin (Lugosi) to perform a delicate operation to restore her to health. Vollin agrees and is successful; he befriends the spirited and grateful Jean, in the process revealing his passion for all things related to Edgar Allan Poe, including his homemade collection of torture devices inspired by Poe's works (such as a pit, pendulum with crescent razor, shrinking room, etc.), and identifying the raven as his talisman. After Vollin reveals his growing love for Jean to her father, the Judge quickly discourages him from the affair. Angered, Vollin hatches a plan when Edmond Bateman (Karloff), a murderer on the run, comes to his home asking for a new face so he may live in anonymity. Vollin admits to not being a plastic surgeon, but says he can help Bateman, and asks him to help in exacting revenge on the Thatchers, which he refuses. Bateman explains that he feels his antisocial behavior is a result of having been called ugly all his life, and he hopes a new face may gave him a chance to end it. Vollin performs the surgery, but instead turns Bateman into a disfigured monster, promising only to operate again on Bateman when Vollin's revenge is exacted. Bateman finally reluctantly agrees. Vollin hosts a dinner party, among which Jean, Jerry, and the Judge are guests. One by one, the guests are caught in the Poe- inspired traps. Ultimately, Bateman is shot by Vollin as he rescues Jean and Jerry, but throws Vollin into the shrinking room where he perishes, and the guests escape. CastProduction The Raven was the final film in the 1930s Universal Pictures Poe trilogy, following their previous Poe adaptations of Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Black Cat. Among the earliest mentions of the film from Universal was in June 1934 when the studio announced that Bela Lugosi had signed on for a three-picture deal, which included The Raven as part of its productions. For his role in the film, Lugosi was paid US$5,000 and Karloff was paid $10,000. Between August 1934 and March 1935, at least seven writers worked on script for The Raven. This included novelist Guy Endore who submitted a 19-page treatment based on the poem that contained elements of Poe's \\"The Gold-Bug\\". A week later, Universal announced that it had signed Chester Morris for a role in the film. Morris does not appear in the final film and Endore's treatment was not used. In October, Michael Simmons and Clarence Marks collaborated on a treatment and wrote a screenplay based upon it. John Lynch and Dore Schary also reportedly contributed to a script, but whether or not their work was used in the film is unknown. Former Warner Bros. dialogue writer David Boem was then tapped to write a script and turned in three screenplays to Universal for The Raven. Director Lew Landers was hired to direct the film with shooting scheduled to begin on March 20, 1935 with a 16-day schedule. Four days prior to shooting, a conference between Landers, the Production Code Administration (PCA) and Universal studio executives happened that was made to confirm that no scenes of the operation on Batemen would be shown in the film. The PCA reviewed various shots of Bateman to determine their suitability and after studying the final shooting script from March 19, with a written statement that \\"We [...] deem it necessary to remind you that, because of the sark realism of numerous elements in your story, you are running the risk of excessive horror.\\" Filming completed on schedule on April 5 going $5,000 over-budget, leading to the final cost of the film to be $115,209.91. Release The Raven was distributed theatrically by Universal Pictures in July 1935. The Raven was banned from several locations on its initial release, including China, The Netherlands and Ontario and British Columbia in Canada. In the United Kingdom, The London Times issued a report on horror films and The Raven in particular on August 4, 1935. noting that: Nineteen days following this report, the Associated Press reported that The Raven would be the last horror film passed by the British Board of Film Censors. The authors noted that this reception did not alter Universal's plans to have Karloff and Lugosi in The Invisible Ray, a film they described as \\"decidedly tamer\\". Following a renewed interest of Horror films after the reissue of Frankenstein and Dracula in 1938, Universal planned to create a remake of The Raven with both Karloff and Lugosi. Home video The film was released on DVD as part of the Bela Lugosi Collection in 2005 along with Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Black Cat The Invisible Ray, and Black Friday. On 20 July 2020, Eureka Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray as part of their Masters of Cinema collection in their Three Edgar Allan Poe Adaptations Starring Bela Lugosi set which also included Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Black Cat. Reception From contemporary reviews, Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times declared that \\"[I]f The Raven is the best that Universal can do with one of the greatest horror story writers of all time, then it had better toss away the other two books in its library and stick to the pulpies for plot material.\\" Thornton Delehanty of The New York Evening Post had a similar reaction, stating that the film \\"has no more bearing on the original source than a stuffed bird has to an elephant.\\" Decades after its release, the authors of the book Universal Horrors stated that \\"few of the vintage Universal shock classics (with the exception of Dracula have sustained as many brickbats as this ill-conceived film.\\", noting that Karloff was miscast and an undistinguished quality of the writing and direction.

The route starts at MS 28 near Georgetown, and it travels north through western Simpson County. The road enters the community of Harrisville and enters Rankin County soon after. It intersects U.S. Route 49 (US 49) in Florence, and it ends at MS 468 near Whitfield. The route was designated in 1953, and it was extended southwards to MS 20 (currently MS 28) in 1956. By 1960, all of the route was paved with asphalt. Route description MS 469 is located in Simpson and Rankin counties. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and all of it is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. The route starts at MS 28 at a three-way junction east of Georgetown, and travels north through a forested area. The road turns east briefly at Sells Walker Road, and it continues northward at Bear Cat Road. The route parallels Big Creek until it reaches Harrisville, where it turns west at the western terminus of MS 540, also known as Harrisville Road. At Mulligan Road, MS 469 begins to travel northwestward and crosses Limestone Creek after intersecting Bridge Road. The road travels north at Twin Lakes Road, then northeastward at Country Estates Road. The route enters Rankin County, with its last intersection in Simpson County again at Twin Lakes Road. Inside Rankin County, the route turns north at South County Line Road, and crosses Hominy Creek near Mountain Creek Road. Proceeding through a mix of farmland and forests, the road crosses Mountain Creek south of McGee Lane and enters the town of Florence at Old US 49. MS 469, known as South Church Street inside the town, intersects multiple driveways and an entrance to a park. The route turns east at West Main Street near the center of Florence and intersects US 49 after crossing the Illinois Central Railroad. Past US 49, the road is known as East Main Street, and it crosses Indian Creek near Briarhill Road. The route continues through suburban parts of the town, with Florence High School located at Williams Road. MS 469 then turns east past Eastwood Drive, curving around an unincorporated area, before turning north at the eastern end of Williams Road. The corporate limit of the town follows the edges of the road until the intersection of MS 469 and Monterey Road in the community of Monterey. The road continues northeastward past that point, crossing Richland Creek after another intersection with Monterey Road. The route reemerges out of a forested area, near the community of Whitfield. The road ends at a three-way junction at MS 468, southeast of the Mississippi State Hospital and the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. History A road from US 49 to Whitfield was constructed around 1953, with half of it already paved with asphalt. The MS 469 designation began its use starting that year. By 1956, a new road was constructed from US 49 to MS 20, and the section from Harrisville to the Simpson‚ÄìRankin county line was paved in 1955. The road opened as part of MS 469, in a ribbon ceremony in Harrisville on November 29, 1956. The route at MS 469's terminus, MS 20, was renumbered to MS 28 in January 1960 to avoid numbering conflicts with Interstate 20. All of MS 469 was paved in asphalt by September 1960, after the remaining were paved in a $47,137.01 () project started in April of that year.

History  Blantyre station in 1961 The Clydesdale Junction Railway (CJR) was authorised in 1845, but before being opened, was absorbed by the Caledonian Railway (CR) in 1846.

It was replaced by a modern building on the western side of the line. Originally served by steam trains and later diesel multiple units, the line originally connected Blantyre to Glasgow Central High Level. Following the West Coast Main Line electrification in 1974 by British Rail, the line was worked by electric multiple units with services via Cambuslang and occasional services via Kirkhill. Upon development of the Argyle Line it was connected through to the north western fringes of Glasgow. The station is from the junction at Newton.

The US government has alleged that Interpal is funding or supporting terrorism, and American citizens and permanent residents are prohibited from doing business with them because of a listing as a Specially Designated Nationals in 2003.Designated on 08-21-03, Interpal US Department of the Treasury. The UK Charity Commission has conducted three inquiries into Interpal and each inquiry has cleared it of wrongdoing and misuse of funds. In 2009, Interpal was ordered by the Charity Commission to end its links with Union of Good, which had been designated by the U.S. Treasury as ‚Äúan organisation created by Hamas leadership to transfer funds to the terrorist organisation.‚Äù By 2012, the Commission reported that Interpal had complied with the order. The High Court in London in July 2010 found it libellous to state that Interpal supported Hamas. Mission and values Interpal was founded in the wake of the Oslo Accords. It states that its ‚Äúpassion for justice and the preservation of human dignity commits [it] to helping Palestinians in need‚Äù. Interpal works closely with their partners in Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan, with the aim of ‚Äúmoving the poor and needy in its areas of operation away from the culture of dependency and encourage a culture of self-sufficiency, and to promote peace and stability within the communities to which the beneficiaries belong‚Äù. On their website, Interpal acknowledge that the volatile situation in the occupied territories means it is most effective for the organisation to transfer funds to local authorised partners and allow goods and supplies to be purchased within the area. In the past, however, this has led to accusations of Interpal funds reaching illegal and terrorist organisations. (See below). Work Interpal works in the occupied Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank as well as the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. Previously it conducted the majority of its work through partner organisations based locally to \\"provide aid and revitalise the local economy at the same time\\". It now operates mainly through its local office in Gaza which deals with funding proposals and disburses funds directly to projects. Interpal has four main areas of focus: 1) Emergency Humanitarian Aid: Interpal provide humanitarian assistance by delivering food, water, shelter, clothing and medical aid year round. They also run other schemes such as sponsorship of orphans and seasonal support during Ramadan and Qurbani periods of the Islamic year. 2) Medical Assistance: Support is provided to establish new health clinics and to improve existing facilities that are overstretched. Interpal also provides medical equipment and supplies to those in need. 3) Educational Support: Interpal dedicates significant attention and funds to keeping children and young adults in education as part of their commitment to educating and empowering individuals in Palestine. This involves financial assistance to schools and universities as well as support for the neediest of pupils. 4) Community Development: Interpal state that self-sufficiency is key to alleviating poverty and fostering community development; they support orphanages, welfare centres and the protection of sites of religious and cultural significance to aid the creation of a sustainable Palestinian community. Fundraising The charity organises several events throughout the year, including charity bazaars, university talks, auctions, and fundraising dinners. Other annual campaigns include Ramadan and Qurbani appeals. Interpal has a number of successful fundraising channels in addition to its mail and online campaigns. Tens of thousands of people in the UK make a regular financial contribution towards its work and many thousands more sponsor orphans and needy children on a regular giving scheme. Funds are received from mosque and street collections and through live TV appeals. Interpal also receives funds for providing and organising volunteer stewards at events such as IslamExpo and Global Peace and Unity. UK Charity Commission inquiries Interpal has on three occasions, following allegations, been the subject of investigations by the Charity Commission for England and Wales. In all three investigations evidence was not found to prove alleged links between Interpal and organisations involved in terrorism. 1996 inquiry In 1996 allegations were made against Interpal and its Trustees in the Sunday Telegraph. A Charity Commission inquiry found no evidence that donations could not be accounted for or were made for political reasons. Subsequently, the Telegraph issued the following apology and retraction on 29 November 1997: > \\"On 26 May 1996, in an article entitled \\"London fatwa backs suicide > bombers\\", we suggested that the Palestinian Relief and Development Fund > (INTERPAL) was run by Hamas activists who encourage and support terrorist > activities in Israel. We also reported claims which were being investigated > by the Charity Commission that INTERPAL was used to raise money to fund the > training of suicide bombers in Gaza and the West Bank. We now accept that > the Trustees of INTERPAL are not Hamas activists. We also accept that the > Charity Commission's investigations found there to be no evidence of any > pro-terrorist bias in the charity or of any channelling of its funds towards > the training of suicide bombers. The Commission concluded that the charity > is a \\"well run and committed organisation which carries out important work > in a part of the world where there is great hardship and suffering\\" and that > INTERPAL takes every possible step to ensure that its donations go only to > charitable purposes, helping the poor and needy. We withdraw the allegations > that appeared in our article and apologise to the Trustees of INTERPAL for > the embarrassment caused.\\" 2003 inquiry On August 22, 2003 the United States Department of the Treasury published a list of six individuals and five charities it alleged to have links to Hamas and terrorism. The list included Interpal. It described all as \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorists.\\" The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control put them all on a list of individuals and organisations with whom United States citizens and permanent residents are prohibited from doing business.\\"U.S. Designates Five Charities Funding Hamas and Six Senior Hamas Leaders as Terrorist Entities\\", United States Department of the Treasury, August 22, 2003. A few weeks later, after a full investigation, the British Charity Commission cleared Interpal of any illegal activities, finding the U.S. Treasury did not provide evidence to support their allegations, and unfroze its assets.Matthew Levitt, Dennis Ross, Hamas: Politics, Charity, And Terrorism in the Service of Jihad, Yale University Press, 2007, p. 158, , 9780300122589 After the Board of Deputies of British Jews repeated this allegation, it was sued by Interpal. The parties settled out of court,Dominic Casciani, Islamic charity cleared of Hamas link, BBC, 24 September 2003. with the Board of Deputies making a public apology and posting the statement on its website for 28 days. The statement on their Web-site concluded: > ..We referred to ‚Äúterrorist organisations such as Hamas and Interpal‚Äù. We > would like to make it clear that we should not have described Interpal in > this way and we regret the upset and distress our item caused.Dominic > Casciani, Top Jewish group 'terror' apology, BBC, 29 December 2005. 2006 to 2009 inquiry In July 2006 the BBC broadcast a Panorama programme, \\"Faith, Hate and Charity\\", alleging that Interpal donated funds to voluntary organisations in the Palestinian territories that supported the ideology of Hamas. The head of the Charity Commission said on the Panorama programme that the presenting journalist had raised some \\"pertinent\\" issues concerning the organisation's links to Hamas that should be investigated. On 4 January 2007 the Commission \\"reiterated its 1996 conclusion that Interpal is 'a well run and committed organisation which carries out important work in a part of the world where there is great hardship and suffering'.\\" After an extended investigation, in February 2009 the Charity Commission report dismissed allegations by Panorama that Interpal was funding organisations involved in terrorism. Again the U.S. Treasury did not supply any evidence to the Charity Commission inquiry, though the Israeli government did provide an outline of its concerns. However the inquiry concluded that Interpal ‚Äúhad not put in place adequate due diligence and monitoring procedures to be satisfied that these organisations were not promoting terrorist ideologies or activities. Where procedures were in place, they were not sufficient nor fully implemented‚Äù. The inquiry concluded that they \\"could not verify that the material it examined suggesting certain partner organisations funded by the charity may be promoting terrorist ideology or activities.\\" Interpal was ordered by the Charity Commission to end its links to The Union of Good, which had been designated by the U.S. Treasury as ‚Äúan organisation created by Hamas leadership to transfer funds to the terrorist organisation.‚ÄùInterpal \\"had not adequately managed the charity‚Äôs relationship with the organisation the Union for Good. The Inquiry concluded that the charity‚Äôs continued membership of the Union for Good was not appropriate for a number of reasons set out in the report, including the involvement of designated entities in projects co- ordinated through the Union for Good, that designated entities had been amongst the Union for Good‚Äôs membership, and that one of the charity‚Äôs trustees was closely linked to the organisation. (Paragraphs 69‚Äì114) As a result of the inquiry, the Commission has used its statutory powers to direct Interpal‚Äôs trustees to review their due diligence and monitoring procedures relating to their partner organisations, end the charity‚Äôs relationship with the Union for Good and ensure that no trustee holds office or has a role within the Union for Good. The Commission will be reviewing with the trustees the implementation of these requirements.\\" In May 2010 the Charity Commission found Interpal to be in full compliance with directions. Supplement to the 2006-2009 inquiry A supplemental report was issued in 2012 by the Charity Commission to describe the actions that Interpal had taken to comply with the recommendations of the 2009 inquiry. Interpal was reported to have complied with the requirements of the 2009 inquiry. Interpal was no longer a member of the Union for Good. The trustee linked to the Union for Good had resigned as General Secretary of that organisation. Although Interpal did have to request an extension of the deadline given by the Charity Commission, it had by June 2012 published a Partnership and Funding Operations Manual that set out procedures that would effectively address the failings reported in the 2009 inquiry. The Commission said that it was the responsibility of the trustees to continue to monitor the issues raised by the inquiry.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120816224444/http://www.charity- commission.gov.uk/Library/interpal_supplementary.pdf Legal actions brought by Interpal On 2 July 2006, The Jerusalem Post issued an apology to Interpal regarding a defamatory article it published. In 2005 Interpal won a libel case against the Board of Deputies of British Jews which two years earlier had denounced Interpal as a terrorist organisation on its website. The Board of Deputies issued a retraction and apology as part of a confidential out-of- court settlement. In its statement the Board of Deputies said \\"We would like to make it clear that we should not have described Interpal in this way and we regret the upset and distress our item caused\\". In 2006 the Jerusalem Post was forced to apologise to Interpal and its bank NatWest for an article in which the paper claimed the charity was connected to a terrorist organisation. In July 2010 Express Newspapers apologised to Interpal and agreed to pay ¬£60,000 plus its lawyer Carter-Ruck‚Äôs legal costs in settlement. Interpal had sued the Daily Express over a website article from December 2009 which claimed Interpal was linked to the Palestinian organisation Hamas. The Express accepted that the allegations were false. In August 2018 the Daily Mail published an article accusing Interpal of funding a \\"hate festival\\" in Palestine. In a separate article in the same month the Mail Online described Interpal as a \\"specially designated global terrorist organisation\\". Interpal received damages of ¬£120,000 and its legal costs from the Daily Mail and Mail Online as a result of the articles. The paper also issued a correction to the articles in April 2019 and apologised saying it accepted that \\"neither Interpal, nor its trustees, have ever been involved in or provided support for terrorist activity of any kind\\". In response to the settlement and apology Ibrahim Hewitt, the chairman of Interpal‚Äôs trustees, said \\"The timing and amount of the settlement are particularly noteworthy within the context of the ongoing wider agenda to politicise humanitarian aid to Palestinians. We hope that this significant success will encourage commentators and others to take seriously their responsibility for reporting unbiased, accurate information to the general public and service providers\\". In August 2019, Interpal received an apology and damages of ¬£50,000 from The Jewish Chronicle which had implied in a March 2019 article that the charity had links to terrorist activity. On 23 August, the paper published the apology in full together with an article by Ibrahim Hewitt, chair of trustees of Interpal. In its apology the paper said it accepted that \\"neither Interpal, nor its trustees, have ever been involved with or provided support for terrorist activity of any kind\\". Designation as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, Australia and Canada In May 1997, Israel declared Interpal to be an unlawful organisation. In August 2003 the United States designated Interpal a Specially Designated Global Terrorist for allegedly supporting Hamas‚Äô political and militant wing. A US Treasury spokesperson said at the time that: \\"Treasury designated Interpal for its support to the terrorist organisation, Hamas, which exploits the charitable sector to raise funds and cultivate support for its violent activities. Interpal was a principal charity used to hide the flow of money to Hamas\\". The US decision led to the second Charity Commission inquiry into Interpal in 2003. This inquiry cleared Interpal of wrongdoing and the commission said US authorities failed to provide evidence to back up its claims. On 21 November 2003 Interpal was added to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Consolidated List, which lists \\"persons and entities subject to targeted financial sanctions or travel bans under Australian sanctions laws\\". As a result, Australians who deal with Interpal assets or provide an asset to Interpal are liable for up to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment and a fine. Canada also designated Interpal around the same time. On 6 January 2006 the families of victims of suicide bombings in Israel filed a court case in the US against NatWest, Interpal‚Äôs bank at the time. The suit said NatWest had violated US anti-terrorism laws by allowing Interpal to raise funds on its website knowing the US government designated Interpal a terrorist organisation. The case has passed through a number of stages and was still active in 2019. The decision of the US to designate Interpal a terrorist organisation has had an adverse financial effect on the charity. On 20 March 2007 Interpal‚Äôs bank accounts with NatWest were closed by the bank, which cited pressure from the US legal system as the reason. In 2008 the Islamic Bank of Britain (IBB) was instructed by its clearing bank, Lloyds TSB, to cease all dealings with Interpal and as a result closed Interpal‚Äôs accounts. IBB expressed full support for Interpal.Kettering Town chairman to return award as bank shuns shirt sponsor's accounts, The Telegraph, 16 December 2008. HSBC and the Co-operative Bank have also refused Interpal accounts. The lack of normal banking services means that Interpal has no direct debit facility and donations can‚Äôt be made by credit card. Interpal can only handle cash donations at events and fundraisers through third parties. Miscellaneous * On 15 January 2006 The Sunday Telegraph reported that Zvi Heifetz, then Israel's ambassador to London, would hold urgent talks with Ivan Lewis, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and a Vice-Chair of Labour Friends of Israel, in order to demand action be taken against Interpal after George Galloway entered the reality television show Celebrity Big Brother UK to earn money for his charity of choice, Interpal. Interpal reacted to the claims by issuing a statement saying \\"Regrettably, there are many who want to stop the little charitable support we give from actually getting to needy Palestinians. We believe we are targets of the Israeli and US governments purely because we are a Muslim-run charity\\".Melissa Kite and Patrick Hennessy,\\"Government urged to ban Galloway's Big Brother charity\\",The Telegraph, 15 January 2006 * In 2009 the Nine Eleven Finding Answers Foundation (NEFA) said that a link between Hamas and Interpal is indicated by a number of court cases in which individuals are alleged to have used money obtained from Interpal to fund terrorist operations.Merley, Steve.

The first case involved Mohammed Ali Hasan Al-Moyad, chair of Al-Aqsa in Yemen who was convicted in 2005 for conspiring to funnel money to Hamas and al-Qaida. According to a U.S. federal indictment, he provided receipts from Interpal and three other organisations as proof of his support of jihad at a meeting in 2002.Statement of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales on the Al-Moayad and Zayed Convictions, DOJ Press Release, March 10, 2005. The second case was tried in Israel in 2003.

Following World War I, Poland's shoreline was relatively short and included no major seaports. In the 1920s and 1930s, such ports were built in Gdynia and Hel, and the Polish Navy underwent a modernisation program under the leadership of Counter- Admiral J√≥zef Unrug (Commanding Officer of the Fleet) and Vice-Admiral Jerzy ≈öwirski (Chief of Naval Staff). Ships were acquired from France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and the navy was to be able to secure the Polish supply lines in case of a war against the Soviet Union. By September 1939 the Polish Navy consisted of 5 submarines, 4 destroyers, and various support vessels and mine-warfare ships. This force was no match for the large German Navy, and so a strategy of harassment and indirect engagement was implemented. Lacking numerical superiority, Polish naval commanders decided to execute the Peking Plan, an operation to withdraw most of the naval vessels to British ports, from where the ships were to secure convoys with aid for Poland, either bound for Gdynia or for Constanca in Romania. Peace-time organization The Polish Navy was organized into a Warsaw-based Naval Command, subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Polish forces, and several naval and riverine bases and flotillas. The navy was commanded by Counter Admiral J√≥zef Unrug and his Chief of Naval Staff Jerzy ≈öwirski. Apart from its own bases, the navy also commanded the Westerplatte Transit Wharf, an extraterritorial base and depot in the Free City of Danzig, commanded by Henryk Sucharski and Franciszek DƒÖbrowski. The naval bases included: * Gdynia- Oksywie kmdr por. Mieczys≈Çaw Adamowicz * Hel kmdr W≈Çodzimierz Steyer * Puck Naval air base (2 squadrons and 1 support air group under kmdr por. pil. Edward Szystowski) * Gdynia Naval Officers' School The navy itself was divided onto four flotillas: * Destroyer flotilla under Lieutenant Commander Roman Stankiewicz * Submarine flotilla under Counter Admiral Adam Mohuczy * Pi≈Ñsk river flotilla under Commander Witold ZajƒÖczkowski * Vistula river detachment under Lieutenant Commander Roman Kanafoyski Finally, under the influence of French maritime traditions the Naval Officers' School in Gdynia (under Captain Tadeusz Podjazd-Morgenstern) was considered a separate naval base. It used a variety of school ships, including most of the Polish surface vessels.  War- time organization  Prior to the outbreak of World War II, on July 10, 1939 the defence of the Polish Pomerania was reorganized into two separate commands under the leadership of Counter Admiral Unrug. The Land Coastal Command (LƒÖdowa Obrona Wybrze≈ºa, also translated as Land Coastal Defence) and Naval Coastal Command (Morska Obrona Wybrze≈ºa, also translated as Naval Coastal Defence) formed the Coastal Defence Group (Grupa Obrony Wybrze≈ºa). They were supported by the Naval Air Squadron (Morski Dywizjon Lotniczy).  Land Coastal Command  The Land Coastal Command (LƒÖdowa Obrona Wybrze≈ºa, LOW), subordinate to the Toru≈Ñ-based military area command led by General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bortnowski, was led by Colonel J√≥zef Sass-Hoszowski and, since July 23, by Colonel Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbek. It was to organize the defence of the Polish seashore, the borders with Nazi Germany and Free City of Danzig, as well as to prepare the defence of the Polish naval bases and the Westerplatte outpost in Danzig. As it was clear that the Polish defenders of the so-called Polish Corridor would be cut off from the Polish mainland, the defence was organized into several fortified lines that were to shield the naval base of Hel Peninsula and the city of Gdynia from all sides, and moved from General Bortnowski command to that of Counter Admiral J√≥zef Unrug. The units included: * Wejherowo Independent Detachment (Odzia≈Ç Wydzielony Wejherowo; west of Wejherowo) under Lieutenant Colonel Kazimierz Pruszkowski ** 1st Marine Rifles Regiment ** Puck National Defence Battalion * Red≈Çowo Independent Detachment (Odzia≈Ç Wydzielony Red≈Çowo; south of Gdynia) under Lieutenant Colonel Ignacy Szpunar ** 2nd Marine Rifles Regiment ** 1st Reserve Infantry Battalion * Kartuzy Independent Detachment (Odzia≈Ç Wydzielony Kartuzy) under Captain Marian Mordawski ** Gdynia II National Defence battalion ** Kartuzy National Defence battalion * Gdynia I National Defence battalion (near Koleczkowo) Altogether, the forces subordinate to Colonel DƒÖbek numbered about 15,000 men. Separate from the Land Coastal Defence were: * the Hel Fortified Area (Rejon Umocniony Hel, ca. 3,000 men) under Ctr. Adm. W≈Çodzimierz Steyer ** supported by 4th battalion of the Border Defence Corps; * Westerplatte garrison (ca. 200 men) The remainder of the Polish forces, including the improvised units, the mobilized Police, Polish Border Guard, Border Defence Corps and the volunteers, were to defend the outskirts of Gdynia and the Oksywie Heights, while the 4th battalion of the Border Defence Corps was to defend Hel. The anti-air defence was provided by the 1st and 2nd battalion of AA artillery, with 14 75 mm guns wz.22/24 and 14 40 mm wz. 38 guns.  Naval Coastal Command  The Naval Coastal Command (Morska Obrona Wybrze≈ºa, MOW) included all of the Polish naval vessels, as well as the coastal artillery batteries of Hel and Oksywie. Out of the destroyer flotilla, all but one were withdrawn to Great Britain during the Operation Peking. These included ORP Burza under Lt. Cmdr. Stanis≈Çaw Nahorski, ORP B≈Çyskawica under Lt. Cmdr. W≈Çodzimierz Kodrƒôbski and ORP Grom under Lt. Cmdr. Aleksander Hulewicz. The only large surface vessels to be left in Poland before the outbreak of hostilities were the heavy minelayer ORP Gryf under Stefan Kwiatkowski (later replaced by Lieutenant Commander Wiktor ≈Åomidze) and its escort, the destroyer ORP Wicher under Stefan de Walden. The submarine flotilla was left in Poland with the task of disrupting the enemy movement in the area of the Bay of Gda≈Ñsk, as well as to lay mines on the routes from Germany to East Prussian ports in the Operation Worek. Commanded by Lieutenant Commander Adam Mohuczy, the flotilla included: * ORP Wilk under Captain Bogus≈Çaw Krawczyk * ORP ≈ªbik under Lieutenant Commander Micha≈Ç ≈ªebrowski * ORP Ry≈õ under Lieutenant Commander Aleksander Grochowski * ORP Sƒôp under Lieutenant Commander W≈Çadys≈Çaw Salomon * ORP Orze≈Ç under Lieutenant Commander Henryk K≈Çoczkowski Apart from the abovementioned ships, a number of other vessels were left in the Polish naval bases, including several smaller torpedo boats, mine trawlers, minelayers and auxiliary vessels. The Minelayer/Minesweeper Flotilla (Flotylla Minowc√≥w) was composed mostly of the so-called birdies (ptaszki, a nickname coined after the fact that all of the Jask√≥≈Çka class ships were named after a different species of non-raptor birds). * ORP Czajka * ORP Mewa * ORP Jask√≥≈Çka * ORP Rybitwa * ORP Czapla * ORP ≈ªuraw Two obsolete gunboats, the ORP Genera≈Ç Haller and ORP Komendant Pi≈Çsudski were grouped in the so-called group of gunboats. Other ships left in the bases of Gdynia and Hel included frogmen support ship ORP Nurek, school artillery ship ORP Mazur and mobilized patrol boat of the Border Guard, ORP Batory.  Naval Air Squadron  The Naval Air Squadron (Morski Dywizjon Lotniczy) was composed of two squadrons of seaplanes, both based in Puck and commanded by Lieutenant Commander Edward Szystowski. The squadron consisted of roughly 17 obsolete planes (mostly Lublin R-VIII and Lublin R-XIII Hydro of various versions), three liaison planes (one RWD-14 Czapla and two RWD-17), and a single modern CANT Z.506 Airone, purchased in Italy. Both squadron were to provide reconnaissance for the ships of the Polish Navy, while the fighter cover was to be provided by the organic squadrons of the Army Pomorze fighting in southern Pomerania. However, the Naval Air Squadron was mostly destroyed on the ground on September 1, with its commander being the first Allied naval officer to be killed in action in World War II. Riverine flotillas During the Polish-Bolshevik War the Pinsk Marshes in modern Belarus proved to be almost impassable to troops of both sides. Lack of roads and railways posed a serious danger to infantry and cavalry that could easily be cut off both by the enemy and the weather. Because of that, a number of river monitors were either constructed or acquired from private owners and armed. They were used on the Pripiat River, as well as its extensive river basin. After the war, some of the ships were returned to their owners, while the rest remained in active service and were pressed into the so-called Pinsk Flotilla. In peacetime, the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy, as it was officially called, operated on the Pina River, as well as on Pripyat and Strumie≈Ñ. It served as a mobile reserve of the Border Defence Corps and was to support the front in case of a war with the Soviet Union. Prior to the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War, a number of ships and detachments of the Riverine Flotilla were moved to the Vistula River as a Separated Detachment of the Vistula River (Oddzia≈Ç Wydzielony Rzeki Wis≈Çy), better known as the Vistula Flotilla. During the fight against the Soviets and the Germans, most of the ships were sunk by their crews to avoid capture.

History The large clock outside H Samuel's premises in Norwich In 1862, Harriet Samuel (n√©e Wolf) took over her father-in-law Moses Samuel's clock- making and silversmith business in Liverpool. Harriet moved the business to Manchester's Market Street and ran the mail-order side. Her son developed the retail business, and opened the first H.

To accommodate the growing business, the company moved to larger headquarters in Birmingham in 1912. H. Samuel, Oxford Street, London, 2016 After the Second World War, Harriet's grandsons, Gilbert Edgar and Robert Edgar, took over as chairman and vice chairman. In 1948, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange. Gilbert was appointed a CBE for political and public services, was elected a Sheriff of the City of London, and was elected Master of the Clockmakers' Company. Meanwhile, the number of H.

History The line was built as a single track broad gauge branch of the Wycombe Railway in 1863. The branch became part of the Great Western Railway when the latter took over the Wycombe Railway in 1867. The GWR converted the line to standard gauge in 1870. The branch was incorporated into the newly formed Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway in 1906. Network SouthEast made the branch part of its Chiltern subdivision in the 1980s. Traffic Passenger services are now operated by Chiltern Railways. The line is regularly used by freight services operated by DB Cargo UK and Freightliner. The trains, referred to as \\"binliners\\", carry waste from London to a waste facility near the site of the former Great Central Railway station at Calvert. For this purpose, during Chiltern Railways' Evergreen 2 project the line was resignalled with two new signals at Little Kimble, one for each direction of travel. These allow two trains to travel in the same direction, thus allowing a passenger service to follow the freight train or vice versa. Services The current timetable, produced for December 2019, offers one passenger service per hour in each direction, with services outside the weekday morning and evening peaks operating directly between Aylesbury and London Marylebone. In peak periods a shuttle service operates between Aylesbury and Princes Risborough, with a change onto connecting services needed at Princes Risborough for onward travel towards London.

The Seyferth‚ÄìGilbert homologation This reaction is called a homologation because the product has exactly one additional carbon more than the starting material. Reaction mechanism Deprotonation of the Seyferth‚ÄìGilbert reagent A gives an anion B, which reacts with the ketone to form the oxaphosphetane D.

The depression began to head north towards western Cuba that day, but as it was a very large and poorly organized system under the influence of heavy shear, the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center emphasized that the route the storm would take was uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the official forecasts were highly accurate in predicting the storm's track. As the shear dropped, the depression strengthened further and it became Tropical Storm Arlene on June 9. It produced precipitation over a very wide area; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain over 150 statute miles (240 km) east of the center. Arlene crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10 with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Tropical Storm Arlene had an unusual structure throughout its life, with a large circulation containing numerous small centers rotating about a larger gyre, as opposed to an inner convective core. Tropical Storm Arlene near peak intensity on June 10 Arlene then entered the Gulf of Mexico later that afternoon and strengthened further to its peak strength of 70 mph (110 km/h). The official forecast at this time called for further intensification to minimal hurricane strength. This did not occur however and Arlene instead weakened as result of dry air entering the circulation. The storm made landfall just west of Pensacola, Florida in the afternoon of June 11 as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). As most of the convection of the storm were located north and east of the center, most of the effects of the storm were on land long before it made landfall. Arlene was the most intense landfalling June storm since Hurricane Allison hit the same location as a strong tropical storm during the 1995 season. Arlene weakened into a tropical depression later that day, but managed to persist as a tropical system as it moved north over the United States. The storm finally became extratropical on June 13 just northeast of Flint, Michigan and was absorbed by a larger system the next day. Preparations Tropical storm warnings were issued for western Cuba, the Caymans, and the Dry Tortugas before the landfall on Cuba on June 10. While Arlene was over Cuba a tropical storm watch was issued for the Gulf Coast from Morgan City, Louisiana to Indian Pass, Florida. A tropical storm warning was issued for a stretch of coast slightly further east than the area covered by the preceding watch, and a hurricane watch was issued for the central section of this region. This turned into a hurricane warning from Pearl River, Louisiana to Indian Pass due to fears of a strengthening to hurricane strength. The warnings were reduced and were then canceled eight hours after the second landfall. Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a state of emergency two days before the storm's final landfall. Recovery teams were also deployed for the area. An evacuation order was issued for all areas south of the Gulf Coast Highway, including Pensacola Beach, Perdido Key, and Inerarity Point. Walton County officials issued a voluntary evacuation for low line areas and mobile homes. Walton County also opened a shelter in Freeport, and four shelters and one special needs shelter were opened in Escambia County. Two days prior to landfall, 36 oil platforms and 16 rigs were evacuated. The cumulative production loss caused from the evacuation of the storm totalled 0.109% of the yearly production, approximately 575 million barrels. The stopped rigs also accounted for 3.87% of the daily production on June 13. Impact=Cuba Between June 9 and 10, Tropical Storm Arlene produced heavy rains over western areas of Cuba, leading to school closures in several cities. The area impacted by the rainfall was previously suffering from a severe drought and moisture brought in by Arlene helped to alleviate the dry conditions. Upwards of of rain was expected to fall due to the storm, possibly triggering flooding and mudslides. United States The only death attributed to Arlene was that of a woman caught in a rip current in Miami Beach, Florida, far from the center of circulation. =Florida= Rainfall totals from Arlene In the Florida Keys, Arlene produced wind gusts of up to 60 mph (95 km/h), causing wind damage to four homes in Lower Matecumbe Key. The storm caused a storm surge of 1.25 feet (0.38 m) above normal. Waves on top of the surge caused flooding on roads in Key West. Damage in the Florida Keys totaled to $90,000 (2005 USD). In the Florida Panhandle, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.51 inches (216 mm) in Plantation Bay, Florida in Flagler County. Upon making landfall, Arlene caused a storm surge of up to 5 feet (1.5 m) in Walton County. Moderate beach erosion also occurred. The storm surge and strong waves caused moderate to severe damage to roads along the panhandle. Strong winds caused power outages to 500 people in Walton, Washington and Bay counties. The storm spawned a weak tornado in Navarre, Florida, causing minor damage on its 0.1-mile (0.2-km) path. Damage on the panhandle totaled to $3.5 million (2005 USD), $2.5 million of which was in Fort Pickens alone. =Alabama= Upon making landfall, the storm produced storm tides of up to 3.9 feet (1.2 m) in height. Minor beach erosion occurred as well. Arlene dropped moderate to heavy rainfall throughout Alabama, with higher totals of up to eight inches (200 mm) to the west of Interstate 65. Four to six inches (152 mm) of rain fell in a three-hour period in the Mobile area. Several roads were temporarily impassable from the flooding, and one road was completely washed away. Wind speeds were around 20 to 30 mph (30 to 50 km/h), while wind gusts of over 60 mph (95 km/h) existed. The winds downed several trees and power lines, leaving thousands without power for several hours. With the storm following a path similar to Hurricane Ivan just nine months earlier, many trees damaged from Ivan were downed completely. In addition, several homes experienced light wind damage. The outer bands of the storm also caused numerous funnel clouds, though no tornadoes were reported. Overall, damage was light, amounting to $1.7 million (2005 USD). =Elsewhere= Heavy rainfall in Towns County, Georgia forced multiple residents to evacuate from rising flood water. Numerous creeks and rivers in the northern portion of the state overflowed. Tropical Storm Arlene caused light rainfall across southeastern Mississippi, typically between 1 and 2 inches (25 to 50 mm). Effects were generally minimal. In Indiana, the remnants of Arlene dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 4.44 inches (112.8 mm) in Evansville. In Indianapolis, 3.04 inches (75 mm) fell at the International Airport. Rainfall from the storm was 85% of the typical June rainfall level. Arlene also spawned two tornadoes. An F1 tornado developed to the southwest of Hayden on June 12. The tornado damaged several buildings and trees on its 5.3-mile (8.5-km) path, with total damage amounting to $100,000 (2005 USD). Outer rainbands also developed an F0 tornado just south of Indianapolis, downing a few tree limbs. The remnants of Arlene combined with a non-tropical system caused heavy rainfall across New York, with some locations reporting 6 to 7 inches (150 to 175 mm) of precipitation in a 2-hour period. The rainfall collected into streams and rivers, with some officials calling it a 1 in 500 year flood. The flash flooding caused at least one mudslide, and damaged several roads. The flooding forced at least 20 to evacuate from their homes, and numerous houses were damaged. Strong winds also downed trees and power lines, causing scattered power outages. Damage totaled to $6.5 million (2005 USD).

Released in 1979 on the DJM Records label, this was his last solo album. It was eventually released on CD in February 2006, albeit only in Japan. Recording and composition In comparison with Kirwan's other albums, this album contains less of his songwriting input. However, Kirwan wrote or co-wrote five of the nine songs on the album, while the other tracks were contributed by musicians involved in the recording (with the exception of Randy Edelman's \\"You\\"). Backing vocalist Tony Rivers provided one song; guitarist Kirby Gregory another, and Dana Gillespie co-wrote one with manager / producer Clifford Davis (under his usual pseudonym of Clifford Adams) as well as singing a duet on one of Kirwan's own songs. \\"Only You\\" was an old Fleetwood Mac song given an update, and was released as a single. Fleetwood Mac's version had not yet been released at that point, though it can now be found on the Volume 1 of the triple Live in Boston set and the Live at the BBC 2-CD set released in 1995. \\"Caroline\\" was the single's B-side, written by Kirwan about his ex-wife (although her name was not Caroline),Richard Hogan, DJM press release for Hello There Big Boy!, 1979. and a sad insight into his state of mind at the time. It is not clear how much of the guitar on the album was played by Kirwan, with Gregory and Bob Weston playing on several tracks, although a press release for the album states that Kirwan took the acoustic guitar solo on \\"Summer Days and Summer Nights\\". Producer Davis added the work of 87 outside musicians to the recording, after Kirwan had laid down the basic tracks. On hearing the finished album, Kirwan told Davis that he thought it was \\"the best thing\\" he had done. Davis said of the album some years later that it was \\"so bad...he had to finish it for contractual reasons. I even picked the songs.\\"\\"Bob Brunning - Fleetwood Mac: Behind The Masks\\", Hodder & Stoughton, 1990. Reception Allmusic critic Joe Viglione described the album as \\"light pop on a mission\\", and \\"perfectly produced\\" by Davis. Comparing \\"End Up Crying\\" to the \\"soft rock\\" Fleetwood Mac, he also highlights \\"California\\" and \\"Spaceman\\" as \\"more accessible than some of the popular versions of Fleetwood Mac\\". He also singled out the \\"intricate guitar lines\\" and \\"sterling vocals\\" of \\"Summer Days and Summer Nights\\".

Despite being heavily marketed, the film was generally considered a box office disappointment. Plot Chun Jae-in, an orphan-turned-police detective, is assigned a job to go undercover in a high school to befriend Seung-hee, the daughter of notorious gangster Cha Young-jae, and protect her from any of her father's enemies who may want to use her as bait to get Cha Young-jae to do what they want, as well as get information about her father's work from her. At first, Jae-in is very reluctant to accept the job; however, her uncle, also a detective, pushes her at the last minute to take it. Jae-in is considered a loser when she first steps into her class, and the gang girls confront her afterward and challenge her to a fight at the backyard of the school. Jae-in, being a policewoman, easily beats them up. This earns her some sort of respect, although what Jae-in really wants is Seung-hee's friendship. She eventually gets this with the help of Kang No-young, a handsome classmate and next-door neighbor who she starts to like; however, Jae-in thinks her crush is wrong because of their age difference. Meanwhile, a new teacher arrives at their school. Jae-in later is informed that he is also an undercover agent, working on her side. She becomes slightly suspicious of him and vaguely recognizes his face. One day after school, Jae-in and other policemen spot Cha Young-jae outside an airport; they rush to catch him, but his rivals are also on the chase. They meet up in the parking lot, where Cha Young-jae is trapped. Suddenly a mysterious motorcycle rider speeds into the middle of the group and his motorcycle produces white smoke, therefore allowing Cha Young-jae to get away. Jae-in and other police go after the motorcycle driver, since Cha Young- jae has already gotten away. The undercover teacher also happens to be at the event and shoots at the motorcycle driver, but the driver gets away. Jae-in rushes after him, but the undercover teacher puts a gun to her head. She assumes it is not serious and runs after the driver, but all she finds is a watch strangely identical to that of No-young's. When she gets home, she knocks at No-young's door and confronts him about his watch. No-young shrugs it off and is playful; however, once he gets inside his apartment, he takes off his shirt, revealing a bullet wound to the camera. Jae-in does not know of this, but she suspects that No-young is also undercover as a spy. Jae-in increasingly becomes more suspicious of No-young, although she is still head- over-heels about him. One day she challenges him to a Judo match during a physical education class at school. During the match, they vocally argue, although none of their classmates or the teacher seems to notice; by the end of the match, they both know of each other's real position as undercover agents. Jae-in thereafter confesses to Seung-hee that she is not really a schoolgirl, which in turn gets Seung-hee very upset. Jae-in then receives news: her beloved uncle has been stabbed by an unknown person. She sobs, overcome with grief at the loss of her only family. The camera then shows her with Seung-hee in a car with a fellow policeman. The policeman betrays Jae-in and Seung-hee and leads them to the site where Cha Young-jae has been captured and is meeting with a rival gang leader. No-young arrives, and Jae-in teams up with him to fight off everyone. Jae-in goes to capture the rival gang leader; however, as she is handcuffing him, a gun is put to her head. She turns to see the undercover teacher, who was supposed to be on her side. He reveals to her that he was the one who stabbed her uncle, and she becomes overcome with rage. Meanwhile, No-young is wounded and running out of energy; as an undercover spy, he cannot reveal himself, for he would get caught. He slips away quietly as Jae-in punches the undercover teacher again and again. A police officer finally handcuffs the undercover teacher and leads him away. Cha Young-jae is sent off to an emergency room in an ambulance with Seung-hee, and Jae-in receives news that her uncle will get better. The movie then cuts to a scene where Jae-in is undercover once again. It has been some time since the Cha Young-jae case, although the movie does not specifically say how long. This time, Jae-in is undercover as a singing nun. She bolts after a criminal down alleys and streets; finally, when she catches up with the criminal, she realizes he has already been knocked out by someone. She looks around and discovers No-young. She starts to punch him, but he blocks it. They reconcile and kiss.

It is the only high school in the Catalina Foothills School District, located in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains. Founded in 1992, the school now serves approximately 1,650 students in grades nine through twelve. The school mascot is the peregrine falcon, and the school colors are blue and silver. Based on the percentage of students passing or exceeding Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards standardized test, Catalina Foothills is one of the top high schools in the state. Annually, Catalina Foothills averages over 10 National Merit Finalists. School history Prior to the establishment of Catalina Foothills, some district students attended high school in Tucson Unified School District and the rest primarily in the Amphitheater district. The establishment of Catalina Foothills was postponed several decades due to the ability of district students to attend high school in neighboring school districts. As the population grew in the area, a large core of Catalina Foothills students attended Amphitheater High School in North Tucson, as the closer Canyon del Oro High School in Oro Valley was virtually closed to out- of-district students. As the Amphitheater district began to experience overcrowding, the need for a high school in the Catalina Foothills School District became apparent. Construction began in 1991 on a site centrally located in the district. The Catalina Foothills School Board had acquired the site in the late 1970s. The school opened to the ninth grade in 1992 when classes met at a district middle school. In 1993 campus was opened to ninth and tenth graders, and the first graduating class of Foothills High walked in late spring 1996. Rankings In 2006, Catalina Foothills had the state's second-highest percentage of students exceeding math, the third-highest percentage of students exceeding reading standards, and the ninth-highest percentage of student exceeding writing standards. Catalina Foothills has been ranked in the top 1.7% of high schools in the US. In 2014, the US News & World Report rankings of the top high schools ranked CFHS at number 754 out of 21,000 in the country (in the top 4 percent of all public high schools nationally), No. 10 in Arizona, and No. 3 in Tucson. In 2013, CFHS also ranked 245th amongst all high schools in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, although lost its rank in 2014. US News awarded the school a silver medal in its rankings survey. Newsweek ranked CFHS 310 out of the top 500 public high schools in the US in its 2016 ranking. Newsweeks list placed CFHS 2nd in Tucson and 6th out of the 11 Arizona high schools. Activities *The Chess Team has won the High School National Championship in four of the last ten years (2005, 2007, 2008, and 2014), as well as six other national championships.

Performing arts The Catalina Foothills Marching Band consists of around 240 students annually and has an international reputation. In the 2009-2010 school year, the band participated in the Fiesta Bowl parade and competition, placing fourth out of seven competing bands in the country. In both 2006 and 2019, the Falcon band represented Arizona at the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Soon after performing on live television in 2006, the Chinese-American Cultural Bridge Center, on behalf of the Olympic International Festival Committee, invited the band to perform in a youth festival in China a month before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing during the summer of 2008. In the summer of 2012, the band traveled to the east coast of Australia for seven days, visiting local marching bands and experiencing local culture.

It arises from the basilar artery on each side at the level of the junction between the medulla oblongata and the pons in the brainstem. It has a variable course, passing backward to be distributed to the anterior part of the undersurface of the cerebellum, anastomosing with both the posterior inferior cerebellar (PICA) branch of the vertebral artery and the superior cerebellar artery. It also gives off the internal auditory or labyrinthine artery in most cases; however, the labyrinthine artery can less commonly emerge as a branch of the basilar artery. The amount of tissue supplied by the AICA is variable, depending upon whether the PICA is more or less dominant, but usually includes the anteroinferior surface of the cerebellum, the flocculus, middle cerebellar peduncle and inferolateral portion of the pons. Clinical significance Occlusion of AICA is considered rare, but generally results in a lateral pontine syndrome, also known as AICA syndrome. The symptoms include sudden onset of vertigo and vomiting, nystagmus, dysarthria, falling to the side of the lesion (due to damage to vestibular nuclei), and a variety of ipsilateral features including hemiataxia, loss of all modalities of sensation of the face (due to damage to the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus), facial paralysis (due to damage to the facial nucleus), and hearing loss and tinnitus (due to damage to the cochlear nuclei). Vertigo may sometimes present as an isolated symptom several weeks or months before acute ischemia and cerebral infarction occurs, probably with the meaning of transient ischemia of the inner ear or the vestibular nerve. There is also loss of pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral limbs and trunk, which can lead to diagnostic confusion with lateral medullary syndrome, which also gives rise to \\"crossed\\" neurological signs but does not normally cause cochlear symptoms, severe facial palsy or multimodal facial sensory loss.

Established in 1909 as a 73 acre (29.6 hectare) park, it features the Peguis Pavilion, Rainbow Stage, the Witch's Hut, an Olympic-sized outdoor swimming pool, duck pond, and soccer field as well as picnic tables and barbecue pits. The Park was originally designed by George Champion who was the park's Superintendent. There are picnic sites and shelters available for rent. In winter the park features a skating pond and two tobogganing slides. Kildonan Park features of park area, of mowable turf and of pathways, including a perimeter path measuring .  History  Kildonan Park was established in 1909. In 2013‚Äì14 landscape architectural firm Scatliff + Miller + Murray were commissioned to come up with a new vision for Kildonan Park. SMM's report, the Kildonan Park Master Plan, was published in January 2015. The report identified several issues, that, when implemented would improve the functioning and enjoyment of the park. Originally design plans from the park's inception in 1909 called for a boat launch area/marina. However this has never been implemented as further study regarding riverbank erosion must take place first. The report recommends that Lord Selkirk Creek be restored to its pre- dammed state as much as is possible. Input during the public feedback stage for the Master Plan indicated a poor wayfinding system, especially for pedestrians. Rainbow Stage has an opportunity to have extended use beyond the seven weeks where live performance theatre events take place. It was suggested in the report that a farmer's market, car show, extending the operating weeks of Rainbow Stage with additional live theatre events, as well as displays of \\"seasonal art\\".  Features =Rainbow Stage Rainbow Stage Rainbow Stage is Canada's longest-surviving outdoor theatre. The covered, open-air theatre seats 2,600 people.  Outdoor pool and splash pad  Kildonan Pool is a outdoor Olympic-size pool, completed in May 1966, opened on July 20, 1966. After a C$3 million upgrade, a splash pad, water slide, and a beach- style shallow end were added in August 2010. During the preparation for the 1967 Pan Am Games, one of scenarios for a facility for the swimming and diving events was to build two outdoor pools ‚Äî one within Assiniboine Park, the other at Kildonan Park. Instead, at the urging of Metro Coun. Jack Willis, an indoor pool, Pan Am, was built instead. Peguis Pavilion A few years after Kildonan Park opened, the first pavilion was opened in 1915 and cost C$13,000 to construct. It was demolished in 1964 to make way for the second pavilion. Designed by architectural firm Blankstein Coop Gillmor and Hanna (now Number Ten), the Peguis Pavilion (originally called the Kildonan Park Pavilion) building was built in the 1960s and officially opened in 1966 with a budget of $125,000. It is near Lord Selkirk Creek, which was dammed. The architectural firm chosen for the Pavilion project was Blankstein Coop Gilmor Hanna. In 2012, the pavilion underwent $2 million in renovations, including new heating and air conditioning, public washrooms on the main floor and basement, a new family washroom, a new elevator, refurbished kitchen and restaurant ‚Äî Prairie's Edge Restaurant, and a new roof. In spring 2013, landscaping around the pavilion was completed, including pond renovations. Witch's Hut Witch's Hut The Witch's Hut is a small building designed to illustrate the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Hansel and Gretel. Dedicated and opened in October 1970, the Witch's Hut was a Centennial Project of the German Community of Manitoba and a gift to the children of the Province. Also known as das Hexenhaus, the hut was designed by Manitoba architect Hans Peter Langes. The hut contains relief terracotta panels depicting the fairy tale in sequential scenes, along with full scale images of Hansel, Gretel and the witch. Public Art Bokeh, an artwork created by Takashi Iwasaki and Nadi Design was installed around the duck pond in 2018. Bokeh lights the skating area in the dark of winter.. Bokeh is a Japanese word for blurriness.

It is a parody of many popular thriller and horror films, notably The Silence of the Lambs and Psycho. Along with Greggio, the film features an ensemble cast of Dom DeLuise, Billy Zane, Joanna Pacu≈Ça, Charlene Tilton, and Martin Balsam. The comedy, like many of its contemporaries (including The Naked Gun), is largely driven by word play, sight gags, running jokes, and multiple references to popular culture of the time, such as Michael Jackson's Thriller, and tongue-in-cheek references to the then-current state of American politics (such as a fight scene between Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton). Mel Brooks, who made a number of well regarded parodies (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs), appeared in a cameo. Plot The film follows rookie detective Jo Dee Fostar (Billy Zane) on his first case. It involves a serial killer, wanted for over 120 murders. To find the killer, he must enlist the help of convicted murderer, Dr. Animal Cannibal Pizza (Deluise). However, during the investigation, his girlfriend, Jane Wine (Charlene Tilton), is asked by her boss to take a large sum of money to the bank. Instead of doing this, she leaves town with the money. While hiding, she decides to rest at the Cemetery Motel, which is later revealed to be a cemetery named Motel after its owner, Antonio Motel. Jo must then enlist the help of Det. Balsam (Balsam) and Dr. Pizza to not only find the murderer, but also his missing girlfriend. All of this takes the cast on many adventures at the Cemetery Motel. In the final confrontation, most characters are revealed to be somebody else in disguise.

Meyer Biography Avraham Dov Ber Lebenson was born in Vilna, Lithuania. He became interested in Hebrew grammar and punctuation when studying the weekly portions of the Law for his bar-mitzvah. He was married, according to the custom of those times, right after his bar mitzvah and he spent the next eight years with his wife's parents in Michali≈°ki. This gave him the surname \\"Michailishker,\\" which accounts for the last letter of his pen-name \\"Adam\\" (formed from the initials of Abraham Dob Michailishker). The family name \\"Lebensohn,\\" which he adopted, is a literal translation of \\"ben ·∏§ayyim.\\" He lived for four years in Oshmiany, where he attempted to establish himself as a merchant. He was an accomplished rabbinic scholar, but devoted most of his leisure time to the study of Hebrew poetical and grammatical works. On returning to his native city, where he remained for the rest of his life, he was a broker and teacher. He had two sons, the Hebrew poet Micah Joseph Lebensohn (aka Michal), and Aryeh L√∂b Lebensohn, a prominent businessman in Vilna.  Literary career  His first poetical work to be published was the Shir ·∏§avivim (Vilnius, 1822), in honor of the marriage of Count Tyszkiewicz, one of the most powerful noblemen of Lithuania. It was followed by Evel Kaved (ib. 1825), an elegy on the death of Saul Katzenellenbogen, which established his reputation as a Hebrew poet. In 1828, he published his book Teudah beyisra‚Äôel (A Testimony in Israel), a work that became the springboard for the formation of the Haskalah movement in Russia.[Littman%20Library%20of%20Jewish%20Civilization%20Shmuel%20Feiner%20-%20Haskalah%20and%20History_%20The%20Emergence%20of%20a%20Modern%20Jewish%20Historical%20Consciousness%20(2004,%20Littman%20Library%20Of%20Jewish%20Civilization).pdf Haskalah and History, Shmuel Feiner] The publication of the first volume of his poetry, entitled Shiray Sefat ·∏≤odesh (Leipzig, 1842; 2d ed. Vilnius, 1863), marks the beginning of a new epoch in Hebrew literature in Lithuania. It was received with enthusiasm. Thousands of followers of the Haskalah movement learned his poems by heart and his fame spread to all centers of Hebrew learning. When Sir Moses Montefiore visited Vilnius in 1846, Lebensohn prepared an article on the condition of the Jews in Russia and the means by which it was to be improved. This interesting document, embodying the views held by the Maskilim of that period, summarized the evils from which the Jews suffered and stated that they were to blame for their troubles. Lack of education and of skill in handicrafts, too early marriages, the ignorance of the rabbis and teachers, and extravagance were described as the four avot nezi·∏≥in or chief faults; and relief was proposed, as was customary in those times, through governmental intervention. I. M. Dick, Ha-Ora·∏•, and Lebensohn, Yeter Shiray Adam pp. 67  Rabbinic commentary  In 1848, Lebensohn was became one of the principal teachers in the newly established rabbinical school of Vilna, a position which he filled for nearly twenty years, until he was forced by age and impaired eyesight to relinquish it. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Joshua Steinberg. Also in 1848, he began, conjointly with the bibliographer Benjacob, the publication of a new edition of the Bible, with a German translation, himself adding valuable glosses to the bi'ur (Mi·∏≥ra'e ·∏≤odesh, Vilna, 1848‚Äì53). Some of his commentaries on the Bible were later printed separately as a supplement to that edition (Bi'urim ·∏§adashim, ib. 1858). A second volume of Shiray Sefat ·∏≤odesh appeared in Vilna in 1856 (2d ed., ib. 1869); and in 1869 was published Yeter Shiray Adam the third volume of the same work, containing also poems written by his son Micah Joseph Lebensohn. The most important of his later works are the allegorical drama Emet ve-Emunah (ib. 1867; 2d ed., ib. 1870), on the harmony of science and religion; and Yitron le-Adam (ib. 1874), a commentary on Ben-Ze'ev's Hebrew grammar, Talmud Leshon 'Ivri with which it has been often reprinted. A new edition of the three volumes of Shiray Sefat ·∏≤odesh appeared in Vilna in 1895. Lebensohn was recognized in his later years as a pioneer of haskalah in northwestern Russia. The Maskilim of Vilna considered themselves as his pupils, while the fanatics saw in him the embodiment of all the objectionable features of the progressivist movement.

Monday, 29 April 2019 Westinghouse Licensing has its headquarters in New York City inside the headquarters of its parent, ViacomCBS.  History  All traces of the Westinghouse name go back to the original company's roots starting in 1886 when George Westinghouse founded the company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the original Westinghouse acquired CBS Inc. in 1995 from Laurence Tisch, it was about ready to transform itself from an industrial company into a media giant. Starting in 1996, it did just that, selling off many of its non-media assets that came with them. In 1997, Westinghouse acquired Infinity Broadcasting Corporation and was reorganized as the first CBS Corporation, taking on the name of the broadcasting network. This, however, ended the reign of the name that had been associated with America for 111 years. In 1998, CBS Corporation established a brand licensing subsidiary Westinghouse Licensing (Westinghouse Electric Corporation); the original Westinghouse name had recognition in the consumer marketplace and so had a value apart from any actual manufacturing company under that name. In 1999, CBS Corporation sold all of its nuclear businesses to BNFL. Soon after, BNFL gained license rights on the Westinghouse trademarks and they used those to reorganize their acquired assets as Westinghouse Electric Company LLC. That company was later sold to the Toshiba Group in 2007. Sunday, June 21, 2020 In 2000, CBS Corporation was absorbed into Viacom, thus shutting down all what was left of the \\"original Westinghouse\\" for good. The Westinghouse licensing division was included in the merger, and Viacom obtained control of the Westinghouse trademarks. However, in 2005, Viacom changed its name to CBS Corporation, and spun off a new company under the Viacom name. The companies would remerge 14 years later, making Westinghouse part of what became ViacomCBS.  Licensing of the brand  Since 1998, Westinghouse Licensing has licensed the famous brand for use on a multitude of products, some of which were in similar categories to those sold by the historic version of the company. Though these products advertise the Westinghouse name, they are not manufactured by the historic Westinghouse company.  Active licensees  These are the active Westinghouse licensees manufacturing products under the Westinghouse and White-Westinghouse names: * Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, providing nuclear energy worldwide. * TECO-Westinghouse Motor Company (previously Westinghouse Heavy Industry Motor Division, HIMD), maintains original Westinghouse large electric motor designs and manufactures new motors & generators from ¬º hp to 100,000 hp. * Westinghouse Battery selling general purpose batteries, Industrial sealed lead acid batteries, and LED flashlights. * Westinghouse Lighting Corporation, formerly Angelo Brothers Lighting, selling light bulbs, ceiling fans, and lighting fixtures * The NCC, selling Westinghouse-branded electrical accessories. * Electrolux Group, selling Westinghouse branded refrigerators, washing machines and dishwashers in Australia. * Westinghouse Electronics, selling Westinghouse-branded LCD televisions and computer monitors.

He began to translate and write poetry in Hebrew when he was very young. He suffered from Tuberculosis for most of his life. In 1849 he went to Berlin, and later Salzbrunn, seeking relief. In 1850, he returned to Vilna, where he lived until his death.

They are part of the Amerindian population that make up part of South America and are an indigenous group.Their society consists of different lowland forest peoples who have maintained much of their cultural identity with the exception of Christianity which was introduced to them in the late 1950s. History The Amerindian population of Guyana is approximately 31,000. The tribes consisting of nine major ethnic groups, including the Akawaios, Arawaks, Arekunas, Caribs, Makushis, Patamonas, Wapishanas, Warraus and the Wai-Wais are mainly found in the hinterland or the interior region. The Wai-Wais are the smallest tribe in Guyana with a population of only about 170. There is only one Wai-Wai community in Guyana. It is located in the most southern region of the country known as Konashen. The explorer, Sir Robert Schomburgk, may have been the first non-Indian to have contact with the Wai-Wai in December 1837. He found one village on a tributary of the Essiquebo river, along with two others on the Mapuera River in Brazil. Schomburgk describes the Wai-Wai as: :\\"Of medium height, their skin lighter than that of Tarumas, in their general appearance and language they resemble the Makuskis a good deal. The Woyawais are great hunters and celebrated for their dogs. In appearance they are generally dirty.\\" During the early 20th century, some of the Wai-Wai in Brazil moved further north. It is speculated that this is because of the influenza epidemic that nearly exterminated the Taruma tribe. From 1933 to 1938, the Wai-Wai people moved deeper in Guyana's interior to avoid the outsiders working with the Boundary Commission. Geography Regions in Guyana. The Wai-wai in Guyana live in the far south of the country, near the headwaters of the Essequibo River. There are approximately 200 Wai-wai in Guyana and 2000 in Brazil. In Brazil, they mostly reside in Terra Ind√≠gena Wai-wai, Terra Ind√≠gena Trombetas-Mapuera, and Terra Ind√≠gena Nhamund√°-Mapuera. These are located mainly in the northern states of Roraima and Par√°. Settlements include: Mapuera in Par√° and Jatapu-zine, Catual, Cobra, Pequeno Para√≠so in Roraima. Culture The Wai-Wai Headdress. Though the Wai Wai are great hunters, they are also farmers. However, the light, thin soil they have to work with and an annual rainfall of 4 meters can make it very challenging to produce enough food. Their traditional, destructive method of farming was the 'slash and burn' method. The Wai Wai are known for their weaving. They twist cotton into yarn for weaving, but they (along with Arawak and Carib people) are known for their hammock weaving. All the hammocks are weaved on square hammock frames. Their other artistic skills include pottery, woven combs, bone flutes, and other crafts. The Wai Wai are naturally musical people and have an affinity for musical instruments such as guitars, flutes, and hand drums. Often the Wai Wai people will craft their flutes and drums out of natural materials found in the surrounding Amazon rainforest. Wai-Wai Women Women play a crucial role in the Wai-Wai culture. In terms of Wai-Wai constructs, the men's success in terms of wealth and power are dependent on female labor and reproduction. The size and stability of a village are dependent on cultural values and how relationships are tied. For the Wai-Wai, the relationship between a father and daughter lends a sense of control to the father over his daughter and son-in-law. A village size is the indication of the level of political strength and riches, and thus heavily reliant on the women in the community. =Marriage= Mansiya is marriage. For women, marriage cannot take place until after women have reached their first menses at around age thirteen. Most women are married by the age of seventeen. Religion The yaskomo of the Waiwai, also called a medicine man or shaman in literature, is believed to be able to perform a soul flight. The soul flight can serve several functions: * healing * flying to the sky to consult cosmological beings (the moon or the brother of the moon) to get a name for a new-born baby * flying to the cave of peccaries' mountains to ask the father of peccaries for abundance of game * flying deep down in a river, to achieve the help of other beings. Thus, a yaskomo is believed to be able to reach sky, earth, water, in short, every element.Fock 1963: 16 Western influence has severely changed their traditional culture and religion. Many have converted to Christianity. In 1949, many of the Wai-Wai people chose to migrate to Brazil following the heavy persecution, violent imprisonment and forceful extradition of Christian missionaries by the, then, authoritarian government of Forbes Burnham. Many of the missionaries were well liked among much of the tribe. When the missions had to leave Guyana because their residence permits were not renewed, 700 Wai-Wai people followed them to Brazil. Some 150 Wai-Wai people left in Guyana fell under the influence of Christian Brethren Bible Outreach. Language There are several thousand speakers of the Wai Wai language, though the Carib-speaking Wai Wai Indians have close affinities to another Amazonian group known as the Arara. The Wai Wai have a history of intermarriage with other indigenous groups who speak similar languages. Name The Umana Yana in Georgetown, Guyana, takes its name from the Wai-Wai for \\"meeting place\\". Konashen Community Owned Conservation Area The Wai- Wai people in the Konashen District of Guyana created the nation's first Community Owned Conservation Area (COCA). This area is legally protected under regulations passed by the Guyana parliament. 625,000-hectare is a protected area that was developed with the technical and financial support of Conservation International. The Wai-Wai people were given the formal title to this land in 2004, and has worked with Guyana's Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs to develop COCA. The goal is that the area will bring economic benefit to the Wai Wai, and protect a large part of the rainforest. Because the Wai Wai have kept a deep cultural and spiritual relationship with the Earth, protecting natural resources and biodiversity in this region is a main objective. The COCA community is open to visitors all over the world, and protecting the plants and animals are valuable to the Wai-Wai's everyday life. The Wai-Wai people have said that the rainforest produces the air they breathe, keeps soil in place as not to clog waterways, provides foods (nuts, fruit, fresh fish), is a source for natural medicines, and many more. The Konashen Indigenous District in Southern Guyana is the headwaters of the Essequibo River. This river remains Guyana's main source for water, and drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers.

It was marketed in 1967 by the Selmer Company, which developed units for flute, saxophone, and clarinet. The system included an integrated pickup microphone and a control box which allowed the player to use effects such as tremolo, basic EQ (\\"bright\\" and \\"dark\\"), simultaneous sub-octaves and echo in conjunction with a purpose built amplifier. The ceramic microphone was developed to withstand high sound pressure and moisture levels, and built into the head joint of the flute, the neck-joint of the saxophone, and the barrel joint of the clarinet. The pickup was wired to a preamplifier and control box which was either mounted to the bottom key guard, clipped to the player's belt, or hung on a cord around the players neck. Similar products included the Hammond Condor, the Conn Multi- vider and the Maestro series of analogue effects boxes marketed by Chicago Musical Instruments. Notable Varitone players were Eddie Harris,Feather, Leonard & Gitler, Ira The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz Oxford University Press US, 2007 Lou Donaldson, Moe Koffman, and Sonny Stitt. Michael Brecker also used a Varitone extensively during his time in the Brecker Bros. Band. The Varitone could also be used with brass instruments by soldering a pick-up onto the lead pipe.

The Winnipeg Public Parks Board was formed in 1893, and purchased the initial land for the park in 1904. Although in use before then, the park officially opened in 1909, and is located north of the Assiniboine Forest, along the Assiniboine River. It is named for the Assiniboine people. The park covers , of which are designed in the English landscape style. The park includes the Assiniboine Forest, Assiniboine Park Zoo, Assiniboine Park Conservatory, the historic Assiniboine Park Pavilion, formal and informal gardens, a sculpture garden, a miniature railway, an outdoor theatre for performing arts, and numerous other attractions. Assiniboine Forest Prominent attractions=Conservatory and gardens One of the earliest park features and a major indoor attraction, The Conservatory is a botanical garden housing more than 8,000 flowers, plants and trees that are non-native to Manitoba, but which grow profusely under the ideal conditions created in the Palm House and Display Garden. The original Palm House was erected in 1914, and in 1968 a fully modern structure was built over and around the Palm House, enclosing it. It was announced in early 2018 that the Assiniboine Park Conservatory would close permanently in April 2018 due to ongoing renovation costs and it reaching the end of its \\"useful life\\". The building has since been demolished, and usage of the existing space has not been determined. In 2018 a group of citizens spoke out about the future Diversity Gardens, that visitors will have to pay an admission fee like at the Zoo, and that this will cause lower income citizens to be unable to afford to visit the new displays. Known throughout North America for its luxuriant display of thousands of annual and perennial flowers, the English Garden (established between 1926 and 1927) contains nearly three acres of flowers, shrubs and trees arranged in the traditional English style. From the outset, the English Garden was designed to serve as a popular park attraction where local residents and tourists could obtain information about specialized floriculture in Manitoba. New plant varieties have been introduced annually. A large rose garden (with more than 400 bushes (there are only a few remnants of roses in this area.) of Floribunda, Grandiflora and Rugosa varieties), broken into four sections, surrounds a central, fish-filled lily pond. (No roses exist in this area, the central pond has a large fountain in it, no fish or lilies exist.) The English Garden is open free of charge to the public every day of the year. The Formal Garden, located at the southeast park entrance, was designed in 1907 by Frederick Todd as part of the original park. It features flower beds in sharply defined geometric shapes that stand out from the grassy areas. Each of the beds, as well as the overall design, is symmetrical. The Leo Mol Sculpture Garden displays more than three hundred works by Dr. Leo Mol, including bronze and ceramic sculptures, paintings and drawings. Opened in 1992, the sculpture garden has been expanded twice since. Pavilion and theatre Assiniboine Park Pavilion in winter The park's signature feature, the Assiniboine Park Pavilion became a focus of early Winnipeg's social life. Originally designed by John D. Atchison and built in 1908, it included a dance hall, a banquet hall, lunch and catering. The tower contained the pump and water tower for the park's water system. It was destroyed by fire in May 1929. The current larger pavilion was designed by architects Northwood and Chivers, and was opened in May 1930. It is today one of Winnipeg's most familiar landmarks. The Lyric Theatre on Canada Day 2009 The Lyric Theatre is a large outdoor stage located next to the Pavilion. Opened in 1999, it carries on the tradition of bandshell entertainment near the Pavilion that started in the 1920s.  Zoo  The Assiniboine Park Zoo is at the western end of the park just north of the main parking area, and is home to over 300 animal species. It initially opened in July 1908.  Foot Bridge  The first foot bridge was built in 1908 when the Park had initially opened. However, in later years it was determined that a wider and safer bridge would be needed. A second bridge, connecting the suburb of St. James (at Overdale St.) with Assiniboine Park is an active transportation/pedestrian bridge, and officially opened in May 1932 by Winnipeg Mayor Ralph Webb. Duck Pond Train Station in Assiniboine Park Toward the north of the park, and just to one side of the pedestrian footbridge from Portage Avenue is the serpentine Duck Pond. Originally a fenced area, in the 2010s the Duck Pond was upgraded with new plants and benches. Although called a duck pond, it is more common to find Canada geese swimming there.  Children's Nature and Adventure Playground  Opened in May 2011 as part of the Park's redevelopment, a Children's Nature and Adventure Playground was built as a children's play area. It is located adjacent to the Pavilion and cost $6 million. The play area features a kid- size doorway, although adult throughway is also provided. The relocated Winnie the Pooh statue is inside the Nature Playground area.  Other  Adjacent to Roblin Boulevard, the last steam locomotive to run scheduled service in Canada, CNR 6043, Class U-1-d, 4-8-2, is on permanent display courtesy of the Winnipeg Railway Museum. A narrow gauge railway named Assiniboine Park Railroad operates in one section of the park, which features a working steam locomotive made by Crown Metal Products. Additionally, a private rideable miniature railway named the Assiniboine Valley Railway, with a track gauge of , is located outside the park near the zoo. The park also includes picnic areas. Sports The park offers playgrounds, a bicycle path, baseball and cricket fields with three cricket pitches (upper and lower grounds) and a clubhouse on site. The park is the Manitoba Cricket League's premier facility for hosting club cricket. (Turf wickets are going to be installed on the cricket field and used for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2012). The Terry Fox Fitness Trail, dedicated to the Canadian humanitarian's memory, is designed for disabled and non-disabled individuals alike. Assiniboine Park is wheelchair-accessible. Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project The Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project strives to help the riparian forest bounce back from heavy use and enhance the recreational trail experience. The ongoing riverbank restoration project, begun in 2006, continues each summer. The project concerns the strip of forest along the Assiniboine River within Assiniboine Park, a well-known and much-loved recreational area just east of the footbridge on the south side of Portage Avenue. Over many years, the forest has suffered a loss of vegetation due to flooding, invasive plant species that replace native species, and trampling from recreational activities such as hiking and biking. Generations of heavy usage has resulted in the creation of an extensive trail network, soil compaction and large areas of bare ground. Restoration is underway in the forest through careful planning, cooperation from trail-users and efforts such as tree planting, invasive species removal and creating a main trail. The project's aim is that by reducing the impact of recreation in the forest, this natural area will still be around for generations to enjoy 100 years from now.

It is located in the upper valley of the Taieri River, at the foot of the Rock and Pillar Range. \\"Paerau\\" is a MƒÅori-language name meaning \\"one hundred ridges\\". Despite being geographically close to Middlemarch and Roxburgh, the terrain and roads mean that Ranfurly and Patearoa are the more closely related communities of interest. Paerau is also colloquially referred to as Styx.  History  As well as the Taieri River the district is also home to the Styx Creek, a small tributary of the Taieri River. The creek was given the name Styx by John Turnbull Thomson (1821‚Äì1884) chief surveyor of Otago after what is in mythology, the name of one of the five rivers which all converge at the centre of the Greek underworld on a great marsh, which sometimes is also called the Styx. Upstream of the confluence of the Taieri River with the Styx Creek, the Taieri is forded by the Old Dunstan Road (Dunstan Trail) which provided the most direct route in the 19th century from Dunedin to the Central Otago goldfields. The trail crosses the Rock and Pillar Range from Clark's Junction (near Middlemarch) and descends into the Upper Taieri, whence it crosses the Taieri River. From the Paerau district the Old Dunstan Road continued on via the Serpentine goldfields to the Poolburn Reservoir and eventually to Alexandra. Originally the second overnighting stop from Dunedin (after Clark's Junction), Styx's importance meant two hotels operated on either side of the river in case there was a flood. Besides one of the hotels was a stable and a jailhouse. When gold was discovered in Central Otago the provincial government was quick to take over the responsibility of moving the precious metal safely to Dunedin. When they used the Old Dunstan Road an overnight stop was usually made at Styx. As a result a stone stable was built in the 1860s to cater for the horses of the gold escort and other travellers, while they stayed at the Styx Hotel which was located next door. The nearby stone jailhouse was also built in the 1860 and while it may have housed some prisoners in transit or an occasional local troublemaker it was mostly used by the gold escort to store the gold overnight. The strongbox that contained the gold was secured to the inside wall by chains. The opening of other routes which while longer were open all year and the Otago Central Railway and Alexandria caused the Old Dunstan road to fall into disuse and thus patronage of the crossing at Styx. In keeping with this theme, the hotel had a coin embedded in the bar, alluding to the coin required for the ferryman across the river to the underworld. Geography Paerau is located in a large scroll plain called the Styx Basin crossed by the Taieri River, Logan Burn, Serpentine Creek and Styx Creek. The meanderings of the water ways are extremely complex, leaving many small oxbow lakes. These wetlands stretch from near Paerau to Canadian Hut. The area includes the 136 ha Serpentine Wildlife Management Reserve. The site of the Styx crossing of the Taieri River is several kilometres from the modern 'hub' of Paerau, where the school was once located. Located in the southern end of the Rock and Pillar Range, about 12 km south of Paerau, is the Loganburn Dam which impounds the Great Moss Swamp (also known as the Loganburn Reservoir to provide irrigation for 9,300 ha to water for the Paerau hydro power station.  Economy  The economy is based on agriculture. The district is also home to the Paerau hydro power station.  Education  The Paerau school was established in 1915 and closed in 2012 due to a falling roll.

It is basically a common law system, with an increasing statutory overlay that has shifted its focus toward codified judicial review and to tribunals with extensive jurisdiction. Australia possesses well-developed ombudsman systems and Freedom of Information legislation, both influenced by comparable overseas developments. Its notice and comment requirements for the making of delegated legislation have parallels to the United States. Australia's borrowings from overseas are still largely shaped by its evolution within a system of parliamentary democracy that loosely follows a Westminster system of responsibility and accountability. At the same time, its application has been limited by a shift toward deregulation and privatisation.  History  The constitutional framework and development of administrative law in Australia was highly influenced by legal developments in the United Kingdom and United States. At the end of the 19th century, the British constitutional theorist A. V. Dicey argued that there should be no separate system of administrative law such as the droit administratif which existed in France. As a result, Australian administrative law before World War II developed in an unplanned way. The present administrative law is largely a result of growing concern about control of bureaucratic decisions in the 1960s. In response a set of committees were established in the early 1970s, whose recommendations constituted the basis for what became known as the \\"New Administrative Law\\". The most important of these, the Kerr Report, recommended the establishment of a general administrative tribunal which could review administrative decisions on the merits, codification and procedural reform of the system of judicial review, and the creation of an office of Ombudsman. These proposals were put into practice with the passing of a package of federal statutes: the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Ombudsman Act 1976, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, and the Freedom of Information Act 1982. Some of those have since been replicated in states and territories.  Judicial review  The grounds for challenging administrative action were developed at common law and have been codified in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The kinds of error which would give rise to judicial review appeared to have been identified with reference to a list of categories such as relying on irrelevant considerations, improper purpose, Wednesbury unreasonableness, error of law, breaching the hearing or bias rulesDr Bonham's Case (1610) 8 Co Rep 113b at 118 per Coke CJ of natural justice. (2005) 33(1) Federal Law Review 141. One of the most important features of common law systems, considered to be an aspect of \\"equality before the law\\", is that judicial review is conducted by the ordinary courts and there are no special administrative or constitutional courts. A. V. Dicey observed in 1885: \\"In England the idea of legal equality, or of the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary courts, has been pushed to its utmost limit.\\" Superior courts of general jurisdiction are traditionally regarded as having inherent jurisdiction to review administrative actions. Section 75 of the Constitution of Australia provides that the High Court shall have original jurisdiction in matters including \\"(iii) in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party\\" and \\"(v) in which a writ of Mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth.\\" Original jurisdiction of High Court. Since this jurisdiction is conferred by the Constitution, it can be removed only by amending the Constitution, which requires a national referendum. Mode of altering the Constitution. Nor, by the same token, can it be restricted; for example, jurisdiction over decisions made under a particular statutory provision cannot be ousted by a privative clause. Section 76 of the Constitution allows the Commonwealth parliament to legislate for additions to the High Court's original jurisdiction; such additions can be removed or altered by repealing or amending that legislation. Additional original jurisdiction. The Federal Court has also been vested with original jurisdiction \\"with respect to any matter in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer or officers of the Commonwealth\\".(1). This mirrors s75(v) of the Constitution, however it is important to keep in mind that the Federal Court is a creature of statute and therefore its jurisdiction is relatively easily changed by repealing or amending the Judiciary Act 1903.  \\"Matters\\"  The High Court's original jurisdiction is over \\"matters\\" as provided in Constitution sections 75, and 76. The Court has held, with a view to separation of powers, that the category \\"matter\\" is confined to issues that are appropriate for judicial determination, although the justices have taken a range of views upon what is appropriate.. In general, however, the issue will constitute a \\"matter\\" if it requires an immediate determination of the legal rights and interests of an individual.. (1986) 16(2) Federal Law Review 212. In addition, hypothetical issues are not regarded as justiciable, since not involving a \\"matter\\".. Further, whether a claim is justiciable may depend on whether the decision would rely upon \\"legal grounds\\" rather than \\"political considerations\\"..  Justiciability  Under the doctrine of a strict separation of powers, courts can review only the \\"legality\\" (the legal validity) of executive decisions and actions, and not their \\"merits\\"... This was emphasised by the High Court in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990), where Brennan J stated: :17. ... The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository‚Äôs power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone.. However, the distinction between legality and merits can be difficult to make.. (1983) 13(3) Federal Law Review 269. Unlike in the United States, and in the United Kingdom,, where the House of Lords accepted that specific exclusions exist. there is no doctrine forbidding the courts from reviewing \\"political questions\\".Re Ditfort; Ex Parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) [1988 FCA 490] (1988) 19 FCR 347. While no specific exclusion exists it is likely that the courts would be reluctant to intervene in certain matters. Historically, the courts have generally not inquired into certain classes of administrative actions, such as decisions exercising the vice-regal \\"prerogative powers\\".. or that involve foreign policy, a declaration of war, national security or the award of official honours. However, there is no general rule preventing this, and the courts sought to focus more on the individual circumstances of application and the nature of the power being used rather than categorical dismissal based on government powers.; (1989) 9(3) University of Tasmania Law Review 316.. The High Court has refused to rule on an Attorney-General's decision not to intervene in a case,. and to intervene in the politically sensitive area of national security beyond the scope of judicial review... Furthermore, the justiciability of prerogative decisions cannot arise under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) as the Act is limited to decisions made \\"under an enactment\\" of the Commonwealth. In addition, hypothetical issues are not justiciable. Polycentric disputes involving complex policy issues relating to the economic, political and social consequences, which are often marked by numerous, complex and intertwined issues, repercussions, and of the interests and people affected, (2001) 23(1) Sydney Law Review 19 at p. 26. could result in a finding the matter was non-justiciabile or a reluctance of the court to intervene. (1979) 92 Harvard Law Review 353 at pp. 394-5.  Standing  The common law traditionally requires a plaintiff to show standing before being given the right to take action...... A 'special interest' in the subject matter of the action will confer standing on an individual. In order to prove a 'special interest', the plaintiff must demonstrate that they were affected to a substantially greater degree than or in a significantly different manner to the public. Only a select few cases exist where a person has gained standing with no 'special' interest in the matter. The plaintiff needs special interest peculiar to himself. \\"Special damage\\" is not limited to actual pecuniary loss and the words \\"peculiar to himself\\" do not mean that the plaintiff, and no one else, must have suffered the damage. Claims based solely on public interest, an emotional or intellectual concern, or a mere desire to enforce a public duty will not confer standing.... While the High Court has favoured a more liberal approach to standing,see ; and for commentary on a more flexible approach to standing. and the Australian Law Reform Commission has called for broader rules of standing,. there has been a reluctance to embrace 'open' standing as favoured by Canadian courts.For the Canadian approach, see . If proceedings are instituted under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), the claimant can be \\"a person who is aggrieved\\" by a reviewable decision. This is defined as a person whose interests are \\"adversely affected by the decision\\", and can show that the grievance which will be suffered is beyond that which he or she has as an ordinary member of the public.See also .  Future  The Administrative Review Council conducted a comprehensive survey of federal judicial review of administrative action and delivered its report in September 2012.] Administrative Appeals Tribunal The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) conducts independent merits review of administrative decisions made under Commonwealth laws. The AAT can review decisions made by Commonwealth ministers, departments and agencies. In some circumstances, decisions made by state governments, non-government bodies or under Norfolk Island law can also be reviewed. Within the scope of merits review, the Tribunal's duty is to make the correct or preferable decision in each case on the material before it.. The AAT was established by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) as a hybrid between court and administrative agency. Among the tribunal's objectives is to provide a mechanism for review that upholds the ideas of being \\"fair, just, economical, informal and quick.\\" The most significant underlying changes introduced with the AAT are the availability of review on the merits, and a right to obtain reasons for decisions. On 1 July 2015, the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT), Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) and Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) merged with the AAT. The AAT has a standing requirement that must be satisfied before an application for review can be accepted. An application for review can be made by, or on behalf of, \\"any person or persons...whose interests are affected by the decision. A leading authority on the meaning of the phrase \\"interests are affected\\" is McHattan and Collector of Customs (NSW)..see also . An application for review can also be made by \\"an organisation or association of persons...if the decision relates to a matter included in the objects or purposes of the organisation or association\\". However, mere correlation to an organisation's objects or purposes will not grant standing as the relationship between the object of review and of the organisation must be 'real or genuine'.. The AAT was designed to be accessible. It is free to file an application for review of a decision listed in section 22 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Regulation 2015 which, among other things, includes some decisions made by Centrelink, decisions made with regards to military or veteran compensation, and some Freedom of Information decisions. For most other decisions, a standard application fee applies of A$884, however a reduced fee of $100 is available to those eligible for concession or who are experiencing financial hardship. State administrative law tribunals Some of the states and territories of Australia also have tribunals similar to the AAT. They vary in terms of the degree of formality, focus on mediation, procedure and jurisdiction. Victoria Victoria established the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in 1998. New South Wales The Administrative and Equal Opportunity Division of the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established in 2014.. It replaced the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of New South Wales, previously established in 1998, alongside 21 other tribunals.. Western Australia The State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia was established in 2004.. Queensland The Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established in 2009.. South Australia The South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established in 2015. In other states and territories In South Australia and Tasmania, some of the functions of the tribunals are performed by the courts.  Ombudsman  Both at Commonwealth level and in every State, there is an office of Ombudsman, with wide power to investigate action that relates to matters of administration.. An Ombudsman has an investigative role: firstly, to investigate complaints from members of the public (e.g. OB Act s 5(1)(a)); secondly, to undertake investigations upon the office's own initiative, termed \\"own motion\\" investigations (e.g. OB Act s 5(1)(b)). The investigations are initially conducted privately (s 8) and informally, through preliminary inquiries (s 7A). However, an Ombudsman has the same powers as a royal commission: to require attendance and examination of witnesses, to enter premises, to administer oaths and to require documents to be produced (ss 9, 13 and 14). If the Ombudsman believes that an agency has not taken appropriate action, it can report to the Prime Minister and thereafter to the parliament (ss 16 and 17). In recent times the Ombudsman offices have been subject to tight budgetary constraints. Privatisation of formerly governmental functions has also removed many activities from the jurisdiction of an Ombudsman.  Freedom of information  Australia was the first country with a Westminster system government to introduce freedom of information legislation, following the model established in the United States in 1966. The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) provides access to government information.. Similar legislation is now in force in the Australian Capital Territory,. and the individual States of Australia. Freedom of information is designed to allow individuals access to personal and governmental information, and to allow individuals the opportunity to challenge and where appropriate have their personal information amended. It is also intended to provide open government. Every person has a legally enforceable right to obtain access to a document of an agency or Minister, other than an exempt document, in accordance with the Act. Whether an item can be classified as a document for FOI purposes is assessed with regard to their relation to \\"the affairs of an agency or department.\\". This means that many political, administrative and personal documents are beyond the reach of an application. Applications are made to the agency or Minister concerned. There is a fee involved in making that application to the Commonwealth Government, although similar State legislation has often made access to personal information free. This object of this fee structure is \\"a means of deterring frivolous and excessively broad FOI requests\\". This application must then be acknowledged within 14 days and a decision made within 30 days. In the 1999 Needs to Know report, the Ombudsman reported that the average charge per request rose from $123 in 1994-1995 to $239 in 1997-1998. There is evidence that some agencies have intentionally inflated charges in order to discourage applicants from pursuing claims. A basic principle involved in the FOI regime is that standing is not an issue: that all members of the public should be entitled to access of government information irrespective of the purpose for which the information is sought. However, one obvious exception has been in the disclosure of personal information. Personal information is almost always exempted from disclosure, in order to protect individuals' private information.. Another very important object underlying the Act is the general intention of Parliament that government information should be disclosed and to encourage this disclosure. Accordingly, the Act uses language which indicates the discretion to deny access to information is just that: a discretion, and thereby encourages agencies to disclose documents or matter even where it may be exempt. There has also been an acknowledgement that general public interest arguments also should influence an agency decision to disclose.  Exemptions  There is a long list of general exemptions to freedom of information. Certain agencies, such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, are given a blanket exemption. Exemptions also apply to documents held by contractors and those relating to commercial activities.. Even within the scope of permitted material, there must be regard to the statutory boundary that Parliament has imposed.. Most exemptions are subject to a public interest test, with the onus on the agency to show that it would be contrary to the public interest to release a document coming under one of these heads. Before 2009, Ministers could issue conclusive certification that a document or documents are exempt because disclosure would not be in the public interest. However, conclusive certificates were abolished in 2009..  Review  Parties unhappy with the decision of the agency or Minister may go to the next stage of external review, where the original decision to disclose or not disclose will be reconsidered. Under the Commonwealth Act, this external review function is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Some States have this external review function vested in an Information Commissioner. Appeals from the AAT are to the Federal Court, and are ordinarily limited to a question of law. Alternatively, the case may go under the ADJR act where it is a source of defining the scope of action to be included or excluded in judicial review and the jurisdiction of any court vested with the function of reviewing that executive action. The legislation is interpreted against a backdrop of other public policy law considerations concerning the legitimate scope of judicial review. The ADJR Act confers jurisdiction on the 'Federal Court and Federal Circuit Court to undertake review of 'a decision to which this Act applies', and 'conduct for the purpose of making a decision to which this Act applies'.  Ultra vires = Simple ultra vires  A member of the executive wishing to exercise a decision-making or regulation-making power must have some law or legal authority that empowers or excuses their actions.. This 'authority to decide' is known as jurisdiction. The High Court has applied the principle that no general power enables a government, the Governor-General or any other delegated legislation-maker to make regulations \\"which go outside the field of operation which the Act marks out for itself\\". .. This ultra vires, known as jurisdictional error is where the decision maker either: exceeds the jurisdiction, by 'flouting a statutory limitation, breaching natural justice, asking the wrong question or being wrongly constituted'... i.e. the decision is invalid; or fails to exercise its jurisdiction to make a particular decision.  Abuse of power  Administrative decisions, including those exercising a discretionary power, must be designed to achieve a purpose or object authorised by the empowering legislation.....  Procedural fairness  The doctrine of procedural fairness, or natural justice, stems from common law and was associated with the jurisprudential tradition of natural law. The courts have emphasised its flexible character, with Justice Brennan referring to the \\"chameleon-like\\" character of its rules.. (1984) 15 Federal Law Review 39. Procedural fairness encompasses the prior hearing rule and the bias rule.. The right to procedural fairness is assumed to exist in administrative decision-making environments, except where it is clearly excluded by statute.. per Gleeson CJ at [25]. Since the 1960s, the courts have tended to extend the right to procedural fairness to matters where not only legal rights are at stake but also the \\"legitimate expectations\\".. of protection of various interests, notably commercial interests, employment, individual liberty and reputation..... In particular, procedural fairness applies when an administrative decision-maker has made an allegation that is credible, relevant and damaging and when a decision is made that will affect a right, interest or legitimate expectation of a person. However, there is controversy around the scope of \\"legitimate expectations\\" and the High Court has said that the focus should be on whether an individual's interests were affected.. However, there is no obligation to accord natural justice beyond the statute.. An example of procedural fairness is that a defendant has a right to respond to a case being made against them..  Judicial remedies  At common law, the traditional remedies are the prerogative writs, referred to as \\"constitutional writs\\" in the exercise of federal judicial power, ‚Äì principally certiorari, prohibition, at pp. 541-2.}} and mandamus,John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Australian Telecommunications Commission [1977] NSWLR 400 LawCite records.. and the former equitable remedies, declarations and injunctions. Certiorari is granted either on two grounds: error of law on face of the record or jurisdictional error..

In 1984, the Brazilian National Foundation estimated that there were only 2,995 Wapishana in twenty Brazilian villages. There are no estimates of the number of Wapishana who live outside villages. According to a 1981 survey in Guyana, there were approximately 5,000 Wapishana in Southern Rupununi, southern area of Guyana bordering Brazil.Foster, Nancy Fried.

Web. 23 Apr. 2010 In 1997 the Wapishana population was estimated to be between 10,000 and 11,000 people.http://pib.socioambiental.org/pt According to Funasa's data for 2008, the Wapishana population totals around 7,000 individuals. For Guyana, the most recent estimate is about 6,000 people. In Brazil, Wapishana villages contain an average population of 150 inhabitants, while on the other hand the number of inhabitants is higher for villages in Guyana, which average around 500 inhabitants. Location Currently the Wapishana are located in the State of Roraima, Brazil, northern and eastern Boa Vista, as well as in the southern Rupununi savannas of Guyana. In their villages, one can find ranches, settlements, small towns, and commercial developments of Brazilians. In Guyana, the Wapishana villages are located between the Tacutu, Rupununi, and Kwitaro rivers, bordering the Macushi territory in the Kanaku Mountains to the north, and extending as far as the Wai-Wai territory to the south. In Brazilian territory, in the north eastern portion of Roraima, the Wapishana villages are mostly located in the Serra da Lua (Moon Ridge) region between the Branco River and one of its affluent, the Tacutu. On the lower Uraricoera River, another affluent of the Branco, most of the villages contain a mixed population of Wapishana and Macushi. Language Wapishana is classified as a member of the Arawak language family. Wapishana is the only remaining Arawakan language in the circum-Roraima area. The term Arawak is more generally used to refer to the Arawakan or Lokono languages spoken in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and in some of the Antilles Islands. Most Brazilian Wapishana often speak Portuguese, instead of Wapishana and many Guyanese Wapishana speak English in addition to Wapishana. Portuguese is the dominant language among the Wapishana who live in urban areas that are bilingual in Portuguese and Wapishana, especially among the younger generations. According to Migliazza, more than 80% of Wapishana can speak the national language with which they are in contact, Portuguese in Brazil or English in Guyana. Since someone can cross the border between the two countries so easily, it is common to find people who speak Portuguese and English, as well as the maternal language. Marriage and family Polygyny once practiced by leaders has nearly disappeared, possibly from the pressure missionaries put on them. Most marriages are now consecrated by a Catholic priest. Divorce is not uncommon and is initiated by either spouse. A village leader may get involved and try to convince a couple to stay together. The nuclear family along with a grandparent is the common arrangement in a household. Often a man who is leader will surround his large house with smaller homes for his sons' and daughters' families. As an essential part of their way of life, young children act as a companion to adults. They stay with their mothers and help with house and garden work. History The Wapishana's first indirect contact with Europeans was in 1498, Columbus's third voyage, which reached the coast of South America. Information and objects were quickly exchanged through developed indigenous networks of trade. The Portuguese initially attacked the indigenous population, who then occupied the Branco River, in Brazil, on slave-raiding expeditions. Village settlements were later settled there at the end of the century. The Wapishana were brought to work at the Portuguese fort on the Rio Branco by the late 1700s. Socialization Men came into direct contact not only with Wapishana from other villages but also with Indians of other groups, and later, with non-Indians from the act of bartering. By tradition, men have control over the labor of their wives and daughters, unmarried sons, and younger sons-in-law in their households. Married daughters usually build their house close to their maternal house. They raise their children alongside their own mother, sharing food and labor. Settlements During the twentieth century, villages usually surround a church. The government has provided schools, meeting houses, and even shops to village centers. Villagers meet, usually at the church or in school to discuss local issues and make plans. After these meetings, men frequently play soccer in open areas nearby \\"Villagers cut their gardens in the forests on the low hills that rise up from the savannas, sometimes walking for several hours with heavy loads of cassava roots, which they process near to their homes\\", shows how efficient they are as a group of people. A small number of families live on their farms, but this is not looked upon well by others in the community. In some places the Wapishana have customarily preferred to live in the open country. Economy Cassava is an important crop for the Wapishana society. \\"Wapisiana women grate the cassava, express its juice, sieve it, and then toast it on iron griddles into flour\\", basically thick flat breads.Foster, Nancy Fried.[\\"Wapisiana.\\" Encyclopedia of World Cultures.] Vol. 7: South America.

Web. 23 Apr. 2010 They also farm sweet potatoes and other roots, squashes, tomatoes, greens, onions, dozens of different kinds of hot peppers, and numerous other crops. Wapishana men are in charge of hunting deer, agouti, wild turkeys, and birds. Everyone in the family goes fishing. For over 200 years now, the Wapishana have been raising cattle, swine, chickens, ducks, and many other animals which are part of their regular diet. The exchange of produce, animals, and homemade food provides smalls amounts of cash for purchases of store-bought food and household goods. Wapishana men craft wooden stools and baskets, sieves, and squeezers for use in the preparation of cassava and other foods. They also make arrows, fencing wire into points, but these arrows and bows they buy or get hold of from other Indians have been almost entirely replaced by shotguns. Women make clay cooking pots and spin cotton and weave the thread into baby slings and hammocks. Introduced crafts include needlework, dressmaking, and rustic furniture making. :Peddlers sometimes try to trade with the Wapishana, but these transactions are described as exploitative, and they are avoided by all but those who are too isolated to understand. Proprietorship The Brazilian government organized Wapishana villages, but has not yet separated Wapishana lands; every village is enclosed. Although The Wapishana people are limited to smaller spaces, they do not believe in the private ownership of land, they demonstrate flexibility in the assignment of house and garden space. Before settling in an area, newcomers must make sure they have permission from villagers. Religious beliefs Traditionally, certain Wapishana men became specialists in healing; they beat leaves and \\"blew\\" cures. They could also use the same techniques to make people sick or to kill them. Now, no Wapishana admits to these rituals and only a small number actually follow them, but a number of men and women do perform a sort of curing that is influenced by Catholicism, northeastern Brazilian folk medicine, and other non-Indian practices. In most villages, a Wapishana man is the catechist who leads the Sunday service in the absence of a priest. Death Deaths were recognized to evil spirits or to kanaima, who were healers that had evil intentions and solely used their powers for that reason. Nowadays, Wapishana use words like hepatitis, malaria, and pneumonia to identify causes of death, but they often still believe that the true cause is kanaima or another malevolent spirit. A person's prized possessions are buried with them in the Wapishana culture for use in the afterlife. Wapishana relations with other Guyanese The Wapishana have been known for their distrust of outsiders. This is reflected in their relationships with other tribes. \\"Their relationship with their closest neighbors, the Macushi, has traditionally been one of suspicion and mistrust\\".Henfrey, Thomas. [\\"Investigation of the Potential for the Utilisation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in the Development of Community-Based Resource Management and Conservation Strategies in Guyanese Amerindian Communities, With Particular Reference to Human-Animal Interactions.\\"] Web. 27 April 2010 In 1929, a marriage was reported between a Wapishana man and a Macushi woman and today there are a few mixed marriages in the Kanaku Mountains area of Guyana. A number of coastal Arawaks are settled in Wapishana communities, they are mostly schoolteachers from Moruca area in northwest Guyana, their relationships with indigenous inhabitants can involve some tension, despite the fact that mixed marriages are more accepted now. There has been a drastic change in the relationship of the Rupununi area with the coast recently with the completion of road between Georgetown and Lethem, which leads to Roraima's state capital, Boa Vista. Wapishana in Brazil Since the earliest days of European contact with the Wapishana, the political situation in Brazil has been different from the one in Guyana. According to Henfry, the Brazilian state of Roraima includes 23 Wapishana villages, which actually all include large non-Wapishana and mixed-race populations. The ancestors of these people were the first of Roraima's indigenous population to encounter European explorers, who gained access to the area from time to time throughout the 18th century. A slight government interference before the mid-20th century left effective political control in the hands of cattle ranchers.Henfrey, Thomas. [\\"Investigation of the Potential for the Utilisation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in the Development of Community-Based Resource Management and Conservation Strategies in Guyanese Amerindian Communities, With Particular Reference to Human-Animal Interactions.\\"] Web. 27 April 2010 By the 1970s it was reported that 60% of Brazil's Wapishana and Atorai were integrated, speaking Portuguese as their first language, and the rest were mostly bilingual and in permanent contact with the state. Brazilian and Guyanese Wapishana differences The main difference between the Brazilian and Guyanese Wapishana is their rights to land. In Guyana, Amerindian villages are state elected administrative units but there is nothing relating to the reservation system and villages are in remote areas. Although the situation of Guyanese Wapishana is better than most part of the Brazilian population of Wapishana, it is still far from perfect. Entirely, Amerindians are the least privileged group of Guyanese society. Among their problems are health and education, unfortunately the Rupununi region is one of those Amerindian populations that are particularly suffering from these problems, according to a study demonstrated by the ARU.

The brand was founded by professional skateboarder and entrepreneur Jamie Thomas, and distributed by his Black Box Distribution company. In late June, 2014, Thomas announced that the brand would be distributed by the Dwindle Distribution company, based in El Segundo, California, US. Subsequently, in 2016, Thomas and Dwindle announced that Zero Skateboards would be operated independently by Thomas. History The Zero brand was originally a clothing company, formed in 1996, and subsequently evolved into a skateboard company, with Thomas leaving Toy Machine to become Zero's first professional team rider. In early 2003, Thomas opened a plant in Tijuana, Mexico, named \\"Edieth and Osuna\\", to manufacture the skateboard decks of the Black Box brands. Zero team rider Chris Cole was a shareholder of the company from 2011 to 2014. The company has released seven videos, with the premiere of the latest release, Cold War, occurring on November 8, 2013. The premiere was held at the La Paloma theater in Encinitas, California, US and Thomas invited every Zero rider, former and current, onto the stage prior to the showing of the 40-minute video. Transition to Dwindle In a June 2014 interview with the Jenkem online publication, Thomas explained that the Dwindle Distribution company‚Äîresponsible for the Enjoi, Blind Skateboards, Almost Skateboards, Darkstar and Clich√© Skateboards brands‚Äîwill take over \\"the sales, finance, production and distribution aspects\\" of the Zero brand. Thomas further explained that the Zero employees will remain independent and will focus on \\"the team, marketing and creative aspects\\" of the brand. Zero celebrated its 20-year anniversary with a photo art show in June 2016. Awards From 2004 to 2006, Zero won three consecutive Thrasher Magazine King of the Road competitions, beating other teams such as Girl Skateboards, Toy Machine, Darkstar, Element, Flip, Habitat, Real, Almost, and Baker Skateboards. Zero declined defending their title for the 2007 King of the Road to start the \\"Black and White\\" tour with the Mystery skateboard team. Cole won Thrasher S.O.T.Y. award (Skateboarder of the Year) on two occasions, a feat that has only been achieved by two skateboarders in the history of the award (the other skateboarder is Danny Way).

The exact definition is debatable. Liberal theists often believe that, \\"all religions lead to the truth.\\" Liberal theists are often influenced by the beliefs in their culture. For example, a liberal theist in the United States is likely to have beliefs strongly influenced by Christianity. It can also be said that all religions began as a form of liberal theism. Liberal theists are more likely to be proponents of moral relativism than moral absolutism. They often claim that there are no black and white concepts, but instead only subjective beliefs. Liberal theism should not be confused with Liberation Theology. Liberalism can also exist in established religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. A key aspect of Liberal Theism is the idea that classical theism can be modified. This means a Liberal Christian may not, for example, conform entirely to the description of God in the Bible. He/she would say that we can redefine God. They generally argue that people 2,000 years ago did not necessarily have the correct idea. Liberal Theism can be seen as a response to the problem of evil argument against the existence of God. The problem of evil suggests that an \\"all good\\" and \\"all powerful\\" God could not possibly endorse or allow evil actions to occur, for example, the Holocaust. A liberal theist may suggest that perhaps God is not all powerful, that perhaps God is just the \\"most powerful\\". That is, that God cannot control some things. This allows for us to say that humans can use their own innate reason to act in an evil way. Liberal Theism also provides an answer to the question, \\"If God is all powerful, then can he create a rock that not even he can pick up?\\". A classical theist may spend a lifetime pondering this question without figuring out an adequate answer, but a liberal theist would say that either God is not all powerful, after all, or that it is a moot point since God would not bother in such petty issues as creating and moving rocks.

The current chairman is Eric Ruch. History= Before ICCF  Some sources say that correspondence chess was already played in the 12th century. Most chess historians doubt whether this is true. In the 19th century chess clubs and magazines started to organize more regular tournaments, national as well as international tournaments. Finally in 1928 the first international league (Internationaler Fernschachbund) was founded. Alexander Alekhine, Paul Keres and Max Euwe were well-known enthusiastic correspondence chess players during some periods of their chess careers. ICSB On 15 August 1928, the ICSB (Internationaler Correspondensschachbund/International Correspondence Chess Federation) was created under the leadership of Erich Otto Freienhagen (Berlin), which had existed in a loose form since November 1927. Other members of the management were J.Keemink (Netherlands), K.Laue, H. von Massow, H.Schild (Germany) and C.Olsen (Norway). This was the first successful attempt to create an international correspondence chess federation. Unfortunately, it survived for only a short period, but its successor proved to be a viable and successful. IFSB On 2 December 1928, a new federation was formed in Berlin. To distinguish it from its predecessor, it was named the IFSB (Internationaler Fernschachbund). The founders were: R.D√ºhrssen (President), J.Keemink (Vice-President), H. von Massow (Secretary), K.Laue (Teasurer) and L.Probst (Managing Editor). Freienhagen (and others from ICSB) continue in parallel with the IFSB. Freienhagen died in 1933. After this, correspondence chess players started joining IFSB. At that time, there was only individual membership and only later did it become possible for countries to be members. IFSB Champions: Eduard Dyckhoff and Eugen Busch (Germany), 1929; E.Dyckhoff, 1930; A.H.Priwonitz (Germany), 1931; Hans M√ºller (Austria), 1932; Marcel Duchamp (France), 1933; Hilding Persson (Sweden), 1934; Paul Keres (Estonia), 1935; Milan Vidmar (Yugoslavia), 1936; Miklos Szigeti (Hungary), 1937 and Edmund Adam (Germany), 1938. IFSB European Olympiad: the Hungarian Team (Balogh, Nagy, Szigeti, Barcza, Boros and Szucz) won the Final (1937-1939). When de Second World War began the IFSB Board decided to discontinue its activity. The top officials during the history of the IFSB here: 1928-1934: R.D√ºhrssen (President) - J.Keemink (Vice-President) 1934-1935: K.Schjorring (President) - I. Abonyi (Vice-President) 1935-1939: I.Abonyi (President) - H.W. von Massow (General Secretary)  Current membership  ICCF, the present successor of the IFSB, is a federation of national member organizations. At this moment there are worldwide 56 ICCF national member federations with altogether more than 100,000 individual member correspondence chess players. Most of them are playing several games simultaneously. Some of them are even playing more than 100 games at the same time. Most strong players think that 15 email games at the same time is the upper limit.

Built by the Phoenix Bridge Company in 1890, it is the oldest remaining bridge connecting Harrisburg's downtown and Riverfront Park with City Island. Since flooding in 1996 collapsed sections of the western span, it no longer connects to the West Shore. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History The bridge was built to break the toll monopoly enjoyed by the neighboring Camelback Bridge (now the Market Street Bridge). The Walnut Street Bridge was closed to motor vehicles and converted to a pedestrian and bikeway link to City Island after the 1972 Hurricane Agnes flood. The eastern span of the bridge is outlined in lights which, along with the City Island facilities, create a dynamic visual effect at night. The span is one of the longest pedestrian bridges in the world and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is also recognized as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. 1996 collapse Western span of the Walnut Street Bridge in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania after it collapsed during the 1996 flood. In January 1996, as a result of rising flood waters from the North American blizzard of 1996, the Walnut Street bridge lost two of its seven western spans when high floodwaters and a large ice floe lifted the spans off their foundations and swept them down the river. A third span was damaged and later collapsed into the river. This dramatic scene was recorded by an amateur videographer, and shown on national news clips. Shortly after the loss of the three western spans, the People's Bridge Coalition was formed to support the restoration of the bridge. Public surveys in the early 2000s showed overwhelming support for the restoration of the western spans. Pedestrians on the Walnut Street Bridge. Shortly after the 1996 collapse, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation contracted Modjeski and Masters, Inc., to perform an inspection and analysis to prevent the possibility of future collapse of the remaining structure.

The show starred Michael Madsen and Kathleen York.  Premise  Mr. Chapel was a mysterious stranger keen on serving justice to those who had been ignored by the law. To achieve those ends, Mr. Chapel made use of promised favors from former clients. People in trouble were usually contacted by Chapel with an envelope on their front doorstep containing newspaper clippings related to previous clients, along with the phone number 555-0132. When Mr. Chapel took a case, his demand was simple: either pay a fee of one million dollars, or promise to do a favor at some time in the future‚Äîwhatever, whenever, wherever and for however long he needed you‚Äîthen your debt would be paid in full. In the series pilot, it was clear that Mr. Chapel had been doing this for some time, as he called in a number of favors to help his current client. A running joke throughout the series was whenever one of those former clients paid their debt to Mr. Chapel's satisfaction, he would say, \\"We're even. I'm out of your life. Forever.\\" The client would invariably respond, \\"Thank God!\\" Some favors are ongoing, such as the one owed from Boone Paladin, owner of The Paladin Motel chain, who grants Chapel permanent guest status in all of his motels. K.C. Griffin (York), a woman who worked in the district attorney's office, was the one former client who stayed after doing her one favor, and continued to assist Chapel with his cases. Chapel made few promises. Those that he did make, he would fulfill (or die trying). Though he had no compunctions about using lethal force if necessary, Chapel refused entirely to use guns. Current clients were sent away, if at all possible, to keep them out of the line of fire (and provide them plausible deniability). There are hints throughout the series that Chapel began his crusade after suffering a traumatic personal tragedy.

Its mouth is located in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and much of the rest is in the Pere Marquette State Forest. The Platte River is about in length from its origin at the outlet of Lake Dubonnet.U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed November 21, 2011 The watershed area is about . The land coverage is 82% forested, open lands or wetlands; 12% agriculture, and 7% urban. Approximately three-quarters of the watershed is publicly owned lands. Water in the river is clear due to extensive wetlands. Mixed conifer and hardwood wetlands give way to tamarack and arborvitae swamp near Big Platte Lake and Little Platte Lake. The Platte River originates from Long Lake in Grand Traverse County flowing southwest into Lake Dubonnet, and then flowing west and eventually turning north, flowing into Mud Lake and then into Lake Ann. From the east, additional drainage into Lake Ann comes from Ransom Creek, which drains Ransom Lake, and in turn Bellows Lake and Lyons Lake. From Lake Ann, the Platte River runs west and south. It collects the outflow of Upper and Lower Woodcock Lakes then flows through Bronson Lake. The river continues southwest. The Platte River State Fish Hatchery is on the river at Platte Creek, Michigan and Brundage Creek joins the river just to the east. The main branch receives Collison Creek just east of Honor, Michigan. At the Platte River Campground in the state forest, the river turns north west flowing toward Platte Lake. The north branch of the Platte River receives the outflow of Little Platte Lake shortly before joining the main branch just before the combined flow enters Big Platte Lake. The lower part of the Platte River begins as the outflow of Platte Lake, south of Empire, Michigan. It runs generally northwest, widening into Loon Lake about a third of the way through its course from Platte Lake. Its mouth is at Platte Bay of Lake Michigan at Platte River Point. Mud Lake is a tributary upstream of Loon Lake. There are three boat launches, a canoe launch and three picnic areas on the river in the national lakeshore. The river above Platte Lake tends to be much swifter and colder than the lower stretch, which is warmed considerably by it passage through the relatively shallow, stretch of Platte Lake.

The A could instead have been played open like the D and the entire line could have been in 1st position. In music, fingering, or on stringed instruments stopping, is the choice of which fingers and hand positions to use when playing certain musical instruments. Fingering typically changes throughout a piece; the challenge of choosing good fingering for a piece is to make the hand movements as comfortable as possible without changing hand position too often. A fingering can be the result of the working process of the composer, who puts it into the manuscript, an editor, who adds it into the printed score, or the performer, who puts his or her own fingering in the score or in performance. A substitute fingering is an alternative to the indicated fingering, not to be confused with finger substitution. Depending on the instrument, not all the fingers may be used. For example, saxophonists do not use the right thumb and string instruments (usually) only use the fingers. Instruments=Brass instruments Fingering applies to the rotary and piston valves employed on many brass instruments. The trombone, a fully chromatic brass instrument without valves, employs equivalent numbered notation for slide positions rather than fingering. Keyboard instruments In notation for keyboard instruments, numbers are used to relate to the fingers themselves, not the hand position on the keyboard. In modern scores, the fingers are numbered from 1 to 5 on each hand: the thumb is 1, the index finger is 2, the middle finger is 3, the ring finger is 4 and the little finger is 5. Earlier usage varied by region. In Britain in the 19th century, the thumb was shown by a cross (+) and the fingers were numbered from 1 to 4. This was known as \\"English fingering\\" while the other way (from 1 to 5) was known as \\"Continental fingering.\\" However, from the beginning of the 20th century the British adopted the Continental (1 to 5) fingering, which remains in use everywhere. =Piano= After Cristofori invented the pianoforte from the harpsichord in 1700, and after it became popular in the decades after 1740, eventually replacing the harpsichord, the piano technique developed tremendously (it was parallel with the piano builders¬¥ progress and piano pedagogy, and as part of it piano fingering changed). There are only few publications about piano fingering. It is mentioned by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (son of Johann Sebastian Bach) in his book Versuch √ºber die wahre Art, das Clavier zu spielen (Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments, ) where he dedicated several paragraphs to this topic (see the German original: \\"Von der Fingersetzung\\"). The British pianist Tobias Matthay wrote a small book Principles of Fingering (). In 1971 Julien Musafia published his book \\"The Art of Fingering in Piano Playing\\" (M.C.A., New York, N.Y., 90 pages). The book includes musical examples mostly from the Beethoven's Violin and Piano Sonatas and from the Preludes and Fugues of Shostakovich. In 2012 Rami Bar-Niv published his book \\"The Art of Piano Fingering -- Traditional, Advanced, and Innovative\\" (AndreA 1060, Tel Aviv, Israel, 212 pages). The book teaches the craft of piano fingering using music examples, photos and diagrams, exercises, and injury-free techniques. String instruments Cello first position fingerings Fingered music for guitar: the numbers 1 to 4 indicate the stopping fingers, 0 an open note, circled numbers strings, and dashed numbers slipping On string instruments fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, beginning with the index finger, the thumb not being counted because it does not normally play on a string, and 0 indicating an open string. In those cases on string instruments where the thumb is used (such as high notes on a cello in thumb position), it is represented by a symbol the shape of an O with a vertical stem below(somewhat similar to «™ or œô, for instance). Guitar music indicates thumb, occasionally used to finger bass notes on the low E string, with a 'T'. Position may be indicated through ordinal numbers (e.g., 3rd) or Roman numerals. A string may also be indicated through Roman numerals, often I-IV, or by its open-string note. A change in positions is referred to as a shift. Guitar music indicates position with Roman numerals and string designations with circled numbers. The classical guitar also has a fingering notation system for the plucking hand, known as pima (or less commonly pimac), abbreviations of Spanish; where p=pulgar (thumb), i=√≠ndice (index finger), m=medio (middle finger), a=anular (ring finger) and, very rarely, c=chico (little finger). It is usually only notated in scores where a passage is particularly difficult, or requires specific fingering for the plucking hand. Otherwise, plucking-hand fingering is generally left to the discretion of the guitarist. Woodwind instruments Fingering of woodwind instruments is not always simple or intuitive, depending on how the acoustic impedance of the bore is affected by the distribution and size of apertures along its length, leading to the formation of standing waves at the desired pitch. Several alternate fingerings may exist for any given pitch. Simple flutes (including recorders) as well as bagpipe chanters have open holes which are closed by the pads of the player's fingertips. Some such instruments use simple keywork to extend the player's reach for one or two notes. The keywork on instruments such as modern flutes, clarinets, or oboes is elaborate and variable. Modern flutes typically use the Boehm system of keywork, while clarinets typically use a similarly named system invented by Hyacinthe Klos√©. Another system of clarinet keywork, the √ñhler system, is used mostly in Germany and Austria. Saxophone fingerings for normal range =Cross-fingering= Cross-fingering is any fingering, \\"requiring a closed hole or holes below an open one.\\"Randel, Don Michael (2003). The Harvard Dictionary of Music, p.228. Harvard. . \\"Opening successive tone holes in woodwind instruments shortens the standing wave in the bore. However, the standing wave propagates past the first open hole, so its frequency can be affected by closing other tone holes further downstream. This is called cross fingering, and in some instruments is used to produce the 'sharps and flats' missing from their natural scales.\\"Smith, John and Wolfe, Joe. International Congress on Acoustics, Rome, Session 8.09, pp.14-15 quoted in Larsen, Grey (2011). The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle, p.42 n.VI Mel Bay. . In the Baroque period cross-fingering improved, allowing music in an increasing variety of keys, but in the Classical and Romantic periods flute design changes such as larger tone holes made cross-fingering less practical while keywork increasingly provided an easy alternative to playing chromatic notes without cross-fingerings.Larsen (2011), p.51. The Boehm system was developed in part to replace cross- fingerings. The first key added to the flute, the short F key, crossed the flute's body, replacing a fingering with an open hole above a closed one, and is presumably the origin of the name for such \\"cross\\" fingerings. Fork fingering is any fingering where a central hole is uncovered while the holes to each side are kept covered. One advantage of the Giorgi flute was that it removed the necessity of fork fingering for playing chromatic notes.Randel (2003), p.352. False fingering and alternate fingering The term \\"false fingering\\" is used in instruments such as woodwinds, brass, and stringed instruments where different fingerings can produce the same note, but where the timbre or tone quality is distinctly different from each other. For example, on a guitar, the same note played on a wound string will sound significantly different than one played on a solid wire string, so playing the same note on different strings in short succession can accentuate the different tone colors without actually changing the note. When the note is played in such a way as to draw the distinction from the expected tone quality (which will vary depending on the exact musical passage it appears in) it is often called a \\"false fingering\\". The technique is common in jazz contexts, especially on wind instruments such as the saxophone. If the tone quality is not distinctly different between the two notes, the term \\"alternate fingering\\" is often used instead. History Johann Sebastian Bach introduced an innovation in fingering for the organ and the clavier. (A similar, although according to Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach less radical, innovation was introduced by Fran√ßois Couperin, at roughly the same time in 1716, in his book L'art de toucher le clavecin.) Prior to Bach, playing rarely involved the thumb. Bach's new fingering retained many features of the conventional fingering up until that point, including the passing of one finger under or over another (playing many of Bach's works requires such fingering, especially passing the third finger over the fourth or the fourth finger over the fifth.), but introduced the far greater use of the thumb. Modern fingering also uses the thumb to a similar extent, and involves the passing of the thumb under the other fingers, but does not, as Bach's did, generally involve the passing of any other fingers over or under one another. In the 1980s Lindley and Boxall showed that the above relies solely on C.P.E. Bach's testimony: all the extant fingerings from J.S.Bach and his circle use the ancient methods, with very limited use of the thumb. More recently it has been shown that all his harpsichord works and most of the organ works as well are playable with the old technique.Mark Lindley and Maria Boxall.

The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams, guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro. Williams and Farro are founding members of the group, while York, a high school friend of the original lineup, joined in 2007. Williams is the only member listed on the band's recording contract with Warner Music Group's Fueled by Ramen sublabel and the only member to appear on all five of Paramore's studio albums. The group released its debut album All We Know Is Falling in 2005, with the album reaching number four on the UK Rock Chart in 2009 and number thirty on Billboards Heatseekers Chart in 2006. The band's second album, Riot!, was released in 2007. Due to the success of the singles \\"Misery Business\\", \\"Crushcrushcrush\\", and \\"That's What You Get\\", Riot! was a mainstream success and was certified Platinum in the United States. They then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, Brand New Eyes, is the band's second-highest charting album to date, landing at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first week sales. It produced the top-forty single \\"The Only Exception\\" and went platinum in Ireland and the UK, as well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the departure of Josh and Zac Farro in 2010, the band released their self-titled fourth album in 2013. It gave the band their first number one on the US Billboard 200 and was also the number one album in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. It included the singles \\"Still Into You\\" and \\"Ain't It Fun\\", with the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Hayley Williams and Taylor York as songwriters, making it Paramore's first Grammy win. The band's lineup changed once again after this album cycle with bassist Jeremy Davis leaving the band near the end of 2015 and former drummer Zac Farro rejoining the band in 2017. Their fifth studio album, After Laughter, was released later that year. History=2002‚Äì2004: Formation and early years In 2002, at age 13, vocalist Hayley Williams moved from her hometown Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee, where she met brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro at a weekly supplemental program for home-schooled students. Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning. Prior to forming Paramore, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis, along with friend Kimee Read, took part in a funk cover band called The Factory, while Josh and Zac Farro had practiced together after school. The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been \\"edgy about the whole female thing\\" of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were good friends, she started writing for them. Williams said of the members when she first met them, \\"They were the first people I met who were as passionate about music as I was.\\" Williams was originally signed to Atlantic Records as a solo artist in 2003. She had been introduced to Atlantic A&R; Tom Storms by Kent Marcus and Jim Zumwalt, lawyers of managers Dave Steunebrink and Richard Williams, and then eventually signed to Atlantic by Jason Flom. Steunebrink and Richard Williams had originally discovered and signed her to a production deal that was later bought out by Atlantic. The original plan of the label was to turn her into a pop singer, but Williams resisted, saying that she wanted to play alternative rock music with a band. In an interview with HitQuarters the band's A&R; at Atlantic, Steve Robertson, said, \\"She wanted to make sure that we didn't look at her as some straight to Top 40 pop princess. She wanted to make sure that she and her band got the chance to show what they can do as a rock band writing their own songs.\\" Label president Julie Greenwald and the label staff decided to go with her wishes. The original management team for the band was Dave Steunebrink, Creed manager Jeff Hanson, and Hanson's assistant Mark Mercado. The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Davis (bass guitar) and Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted \\"I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This is not going to work because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. I knew we were on to something.\\" According to Williams, the name \\"Paramore\\" came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players. Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone \\"paramour\\" (\\"secret lover\\"), they decided to adopt the name, using the Paramore spelling. Paramore was originally supposed to release their music on Atlantic Records, but the label's marketing department decided it would be better for the image of the band to not have them attached to a major label. Instead, they released their music through the niche label Fueled by Ramen. Lyor Cohen, the head of Warner Music Group, had already identified Fueled by Ramen as a label they should partner with. It was decided the rock label would make an ideal match for Paramore. According to Robertson, when the band was presented to Fueled by Ramen's CEO John Janick, \\"he got the vision of the band immediately.\\" Janick went to a Taste of Chaos performance in Orlando, Florida to see the band perform live. In April 2005, after a smaller private performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to Atlantic Records and Fueled By Ramen. The band's first song written together was \\"Conspiracy\\", which was later used on their debut album. At this time, they were touring the southeast, usually being driven by Williams' parents. She commented that \\"Back then, I guess we were all thinking, after school, we'll go to the house and practice. It was what we loved to do for fun, and still do! I don't think any of us really knew this would turn out to be what it's become.\\" 2005‚Äì2006: All We Know Is Falling Paramore performing in Portland, Oregon, January 2006 Paramore traveled back to Orlando, Florida, but shortly after arriving, Jeremy Davis left the band, citing personal reasons. The remaining four members of Paramore continued with the album, writing \\"All We Know\\" about his departure, and later deciding to base All We Know Is Falling around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Hayley Williams explains, \\"The couch on the cover of All We Know is Falling with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space.\\" Before touring, the band added John Hembree (bass) to their lineup to replace Davis. During that summer, Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl stage of the 2005 Warped Tour. After being asked by the band, Jeremy Davis returned to Paramore after five months apart, replacing Hembree. All We Know Is Falling was released on July 24, 2005, and reached No. 30 on the Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. Paramore released \\"Pressure\\" as its first single, with a video directed by Shane Drake, but the song failed to chart. The video featured the band performing in a warehouse, eventually getting sprayed with water sprinklers as the storyline of a conflicted couple occurs. In July, \\"Emergency\\" was released as the second single, the video again reuniting the band with director Shane Drake and featuring Hunter Lamb (rhythm guitar), who replaced Jason Bynum in December 2005. The video for \\"Emergency\\" showcased Paramore in another performance, this time fixing the members' bloody costumes. The third single, \\"All We Know\\", was released with limited airtime, with the video consisting of a collection of live performances and backstage footage. After the band's later success, All We Know Is Falling and \\"Pressure\\" were certified Gold by the RIAA. In January 2006, the band took part in the Winter Go West tour where they played alongside Seattle bands Amber Pacific and The Lashes. In February, Hayley Williams was featured on \\"Keep Dreaming Upside Down\\" by October Fall. In spring of 2006, Paramore was an opening act on tours for both Bayside and The Rocket Summer. The band then covered Foo Fighters' \\"My Hero\\" for the Sound of Superman soundtrack which was released on June 26, 2006. During the summer of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour, primarily on the Volcom and Hurley Stages, and their first night on the Main Stage was at a date in their hometown of Nashville. During the band's time at Warped Tour, they released The Summer Tic EP, which was sold exclusively during the tour. Paramore's first US headlining tour began on August 2, 2006 to a sold-out audience with support from This Providence, Cute Is What We Aim For, and Hit the Lights with the final show in Nashville. That year they were voted \\"Best New Band\\", and Hayley Williams was voted as No. 2 \\"Sexiest Female\\", by readers of the British magazine Kerrang!. In 2007, Lamb left the group to get married, and Paramore continued onward as a quartet. Paramore was then named by British magazine NME as one of ten bands to watch out for in their \\"New Noise 2007\\" feature. Paramore was featured in Kerrang! magazine once more, however, Hayley Williams believed the article was an untrue portrayal of the band, particularly because it focused on her as the main component. Afterwards, Williams addressed the issue in the band's LiveJournal, with a post saying, \\"we could‚Äôve done without a cover piece. sorry, if it offends anyone at Kerrang! but I don‚Äôt think there was one bit of truth in that article.\\" In April, Hayley Williams' vocals were featured in \\"Then Came To Kill\\" by The Chariot. They headlined a tour in April through May 2007 with This Providence, The Almost, and Love Arcade. The Almost and Love Arcade were replaced by Quietdrive for the second half of the tour. 2007‚Äì2008: Riot! Zac Farro (drums), Hayley Williams (lead vocalist), and Jeremy Davis (bass guitar), performing on the 2007 Vans Warped Tour at the Tweeter Center at the Waterfront in Camden, New Jersey. Before work began on the band's next album, Davis was expelled from the band due to \\"his lack of work ethic and participation in things that Zac, Hayley and I didn‚Äôt agree with,\\" according to Josh Farro. After an agreement involving the remaining three members, Davis was reinstated as bassist, and Taylor York became the band's new guitarist. York had been in a band with the Farro brothers before the two met Williams. After being courted by producers Neal Avron and Howard Benson, Paramore opted to record the album with producer David Bendeth in New Jersey, who had previously worked with Your Vegas and Breaking Benjamin. The album, titled Riot!, was released on June 12, 2007, entering the Billboard 200 at number 20 and the UK charts at number 24. The album sold 44,000 units its first week in the United States. The name Riot! had been chosen because it meant \\"a sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion\\", and it was a word that \\"summed it all up\\". The first single from the album, \\"Misery Business\\", was released on June 21, 2007. According to Williams, \\"Misery Business\\" is \\"more honest than anything I've ever written, and the guys matched that emotion musically.\\" In the summer of 2007, Paramore participated in their third Warped Tour, and they posted journals of their experiences on yourhereblog for MTV. On October 11, 2007, the music video for \\"Crushcrushcrush\\" debuted on the United States television as the next single from Riot!. The video for \\"Crushcrushcrush\\" featured the band playing a performance in a barren desert, being spied upon, and later destroying their equipment. The single was released in the United States on November 19 and made available in the United Kingdom on November 12, 2007. Hayley Williams recorded guest vocals for the tracks \\"The Church Channel\\" and \\"Plea\\" for the Say Anything concept album In Defense of the Genre released on October 23, 2007. The group performed live, acoustic style in Boston on November 29, 2007 for FNX radio. On December 31, 2007, Paramore performed on the MTV New Year's Eve program which ran from 11:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Paramore was featured on the cover of February 2008 issue of Alternative Press magazine and voted \\"Best Band Of 2007\\" by the readers. The band was nominated for \\"Best New Artist\\" at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards presented on February 10, 2008 but lost to Amy Winehouse. Early 2008 saw Paramore touring the United Kingdom, supporting their album Riot!, along with New Found Glory, Kids in Glass Houses and Conditions. In early February 2008, the band began a tour in Europe, however on February 21, 2008, the band announced that they had canceled six shows due to personal issues. Williams wrote on the band's web site that \\"the break will give that band 'a chance to get away and work out our personal issues'\\". MTV.com reported that fans of Paramore were speculating about the future of the band and reported rumors of trouble had begun earlier in the month when Josh Farro expressed his anger against the media's focus on Hayley Williams. The band, however, returned to their hometown to record the music video for the fourth single \\"That's What You Get\\", which was then released on March 24, 2008. The band toured with Jimmy Eat World in the United States in April and May 2008. The band headlined the Give It A Name festival in the United Kingdom on May 10 and 11, 2008. Also the band performed on the In New Music We Trust Stage at Radio 1's One Big Weekend in Mote Park, Kent on May 10, 2008. Paramore played their first Ireland show at the RDS in Dublin on June 2, 2008, followed by the 2008 Vans Warped Tour from July 1‚Äì6. Orlando, Florida on April 23, 2007 From July 25 to September 1, Paramore embarked on a tour named \\"The Final Riot!\\". On this tour, the band performed part of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\". On September 2, 2008, Paramore released a collaboration hoodie along with Hurley Clothing based on the album Riot!. All proceeds went to the Love146 foundation. The band released a live album named The Final Riot! on November 25, 2008. The album includes a bonus DVD with a full concert recorded in Chicago, as well as a behind the scenes documentary. As of April 9, 2009, The Final Riot! is certified gold in the United States. 2009‚Äì2011: Brand New Eyes, departure of the Farros, and Singles Club In January 2009, Josh Farro spoke about the band's next studio album. Talking to Kerrang!, Farro said: \\"We're gonna try to [record] it in Nashville. I think writing the album there will inspire us, and then if we record there too it'll be a lot easier since we can sleep in our beds at night rather than in hotels like the other 300 days out of the year! We're not sure who's going to produce the record yet. We did \\"Decode\\" with [producer] Rob Cavallo, which was a good experience, but we're looking around and don't want to make any decisions until we have a lot of songs and we know what we're looking for. We really enjoy our live sound and we want a producer who can really capture that.\\" Paramore wrote and completed their third album Brand New Eyes in early 2009. The first single from the album was \\"Ignorance\\" and was released July 7, 2009. Paramore was the special guest with Bedouin Soundclash, The Sounds and Janelle Mon√°e at the No Doubt Summer Tour 2009, starting in May 2009 in outdoor amphitheaters and arenas across the US and Canada.Bedouin Soundclash, and Paramore Opening for No Doubt's Reunion Tour. Noise Press. Retrieved on February 25, 2009 The official music video for \\"Ignorance\\" aired on all MTV platforms, networks, and websites on August 13, 2009. Paramore, along with Paper Route and The Swellers, toured in support of Brand New Eyes in the fall of 2009. Some tour dates were postponed due to Hayley Williams becoming infected with laryngitis. \\"Brick By Boring Brick\\", \\"The Only Exception\\", \\"Careful\\" and \\"Playing God\\" were the album's following singles. To promote the album, the band recorded a performance for MTV Unplugged. Josh Farro in Vancouver in the Summer Tour 2009 Paramore then played a sold out 15-date European tour with You Me At Six, Paper Route and Now Now Every Children. Their stadium tour culminated at London's Wembley Arena, to an audience of 12,500. The band performed in 2010 in the Australian Soundwave Festival along with bands such as Faith No More, Placebo, You Me at Six, All Time Low, Jimmy Eat World and Taking Back Sunday. Shortly before the tour, lead guitarist Josh Farro announced via the band's LiveJournal that he was engaged and stayed behind to plan his wedding. Justin York, brother of Taylor York, filled in for him on the tour. The band, with Farro returned, embarked on a spring tour of the U.S. in late April. Paramore supported Green Day on selected dates of their Stadium tour, in Dublin and Paris. The band headlined the 2010 Honda Civic Tour, which began on July 23 in Raleigh, NC and closed on September 19 in Anaheim, CA. After a short United Kingdom tour in November 2010, the band announced, on December 2, 2010, the official dates for a South American tour to take place during February and March 2011. The band were set to take a break after their South American Tour in 2011 to write for their fourth studio album. On December 18, 2010, a message from Hayley, Jeremy, and Taylor was released through Paramore.net stating that Josh and Zac were leaving the band. The band also confirmed the scheduled South American tour would still happen. Josh Farro wrote a statement on the departure on his Blogger, claiming that the band was \\"a manufactured product of a major-label.\\" He accused Hayley Williams of being manipulated by her management, treating the rest of the group as her solo project, and claimed she was the only member of the band who was signed to Atlantic Records, while her bandmates were simply \\"riding on the coattails of her dream\\". On December 30, 2010, MTV News interviewed Williams, York and Davis in Franklin, Tennessee regarding their reactions to Farro's response. The band members confirmed many of Farro's statements, notably that Williams was indeed the only member of the band actually signed to Atlantic. They added that they felt the statement was irrelevant, and claimed they had addressed many of the Farro's critiques already throughout the course of their career. Paramore in the Brand New Eyes World Tour at the Warfield in San Francisco On January 10, 2011, in an interview with MTV, Hayley Williams said that despite the band losing two of its founding members, they would release new music in 2011, although they had not confirmed if it would be a full album for release or just a small number of songs. The singer also admitted that Paramore's style was likely to change with the new lineup, but clarified that the band would still retain their core signature sound. The band entered the studio upon returning from their South American tour to record a batch of songs that were released over the summer, prior to their fourth full-length album. One of the songs included \\"In the Mourning\\", which Williams debuted on her Tumblr page. Paramore later confirmed they were entering a studio in Los Angeles with producer Rob Cavallo to record what would be the Singles Club. On June 3, 2011, Paramore released the single \\"Monster\\", featured on the Transformers: Dark of the Moon soundtrack, on YouTube. This is the first song that the band released without the Farro brothers. On June 9, 2011, Hayley Williams announced that the band had started to write their fourth album, which they hoped to start recording at the end of the year, with an early 2012 release. On October 11, 2011, Paramore announced that they would release a new song for each of the remaining months of 2011. The band set up the Singles Club on their website which gave fans the chance to purchase the singles when they were released, as they were released exclusively through the Singles Club and were therefore not sold elsewhere. A song called \\"Renegade\\", premiered the day of the announcement, with \\"Hello Cold World\\" following on November 7 and \\"In the Mourning\\" on December 5. In 2011, former member, Josh Farro, formed Novel American. Zac Farro later joined the band. 2012‚Äì2015: Paramore and Davis' second exit On April 18, 2012, Williams announced that the producer for their fourth album was Justin Meldal-Johnsen. Former Lostprophets and current Angels & Airwaves and Nine Inch Nails drummer Ilan Rubin was confirmed to be the session drummer for the recording of the album. Paramore was officially released on April 5, 2013 and a #1 at US albums chart Billboard 200. The first single from the album, titled \\"Now\\", was released online on January 22, 2013, and the album's second single, \\"Still Into You\\", was released on March 14, 2013 achieving commercial success. The third single, \\"Daydreaming\\", was released on December 2, 2013. The album's fourth single, \\"Ain't It Fun\\", was released on February 4, 2014, eventually becoming the band's highest charting song in the United States and a winner for Best Rock Song at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. On November 24, 2014, Paramore: Self-Titled Deluxe was released, which includes a remake of \\"Hate to See Your Heart Break,\\" a song originally on Paramore, featuring Joy Williams; this is the band's first collaboration on a song. The band embarked on the \\"Writing the Future\\" tour with Copeland, they said in a blog post that \\"It feels right to bring the Self-Titled era to a close. We've had a very personal and hugely triumphant journey with this one. What wouldn't feel right is saying goodbye to this time in the band's career and not celebrating it with our fans in some special way.\\" On December 14, 2015, bassist Jeremy Davis left the band. In March 2016, Davis was involved in a legal battle with Paramore, claiming to be eligible to enjoy the benefits of a business partnership with Hayley Williams as a co- owner of the band. This was quickly dismissed and he was again involved in a legal battle with Hayley Williams and Taylor York over a breach of contract entitling him to ownership and authorship of songs on their self-titled record, including \\"Ain't It Fun\\", and again, claiming to be eligible to enjoy the benefits of the earnings the two received from these songs and album. Davis reached a settlement with the band in April 2017. During this period, lead singer Williams later revealed that she suffered from depression and mental health issues following the departure of Davis as well as a divorce with her ex-husband Chad Gilbert. In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, shes described it as \\"torment\\" and mentioned that she \\"didn't laugh for a long time\\". As a result, Williams privately left the band for a short period in 2015, briefly leaving York as the only remaining member of the group.  2016‚Äì2019: Zac Farro's return and After Laughter  On January 19, 2016, Williams announced over Twitter that the band was in the process of writing their fifth album. On June 8, 2016, the band posted a short video of themselves in the studio to their social media. This was preceded by a number of images which all included both former drummer Zac Farro and producer Justin Meldal-Johnsen, leading fans and various media outlets to speculate the return of Farro. On June 17, Farro was featured yet again in a picture uploaded to social media, this time behind a drum set, confirming that he would be recording drums for the album, though he later clarified that he was only recording drums for the album and that he had not rejoined the band as a full member. Despite this, on February 2, 2017, the band announced that Farro would return as the official drummer of the band. On April 19, 2017, Paramore released \\"Hard Times\\" as the lead single from their album After Laughter, which they announced would be released on May 12, 2017. On May 3, a second single was released, titled \\"Told You So\\". A music video for the song \\"Fake Happy\\" was released on November 17, 2017. On February 5, 2018, a music video for \\"Rose-Colored Boy\\" was released, which is also the album's fourth single. The music video for \\"Caught in the Middle\\", the album's fifth single, was released on June 26, 2018. On September 7, 2018, Hayley Williams announced during a concert that the band will play the song \\"Misery Business\\" \\"for the last time for a really long time\\", mainly due to a line from the second verse that was perceived to be sexist. 2020‚Äìpresent: Upcoming sixth album On May 11, 2020, Williams announced that a sixth album would see the group returning to their pop punk roots, commenting \\"We've found ourselves listening to a lot of older music that we grew up being inspired by.\\" Musical style and influences Paramore in Vancouver 2009 Paramore's music style has generally been regarded as alternative rock, , pop rock, power pop, , emo, pop, and new wave. Joshua Martin had written after an interview with Hayley Williams, \\"The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently. It's sped up, and slowed down. It's emo without being whiny, or bratty. Almost a very literal anti-Avril Lavigne.\\" Alternative Press magazine had commented that the band was \\"young-sounding\\", while consistently being \\"honest.\\" Paramore's first album All We Know is Falling had an arguably more \\"formulaic pop-punk\\" sound that was \\"delivered particularly well\\" and the combination of the two had created a \\"refined rock infused pop/punk album.\\" The band's second release, Riot! was said to explore a 'diverse range of styles,\\" however, not straying far from \\"their signature sound.\\" The band's later albums, such as Paramore and After Laughter, included more of a new wave and synth-pop sound. Williams and Taylor York performing with Paramore, 2013 Alternative Press and various other reviewers have noted that the band's stage performances have helped boost them to larger fame. Alternative Press states that Williams \\"has more charisma than singers twice her age, and her band aren't far behind in their chops, either.\\" Singer-songwriter John Mayer had praised Williams' voice in a blog in October 2007, calling her \\"The great orange hope\\"; \\"orange\\" in reference to her hair color. Due to the female-fronted aspect of the band, Paramore has gained comparisons to Kelly Clarkson and the aforementioned Avril Lavigne, to which one reviewer said was \\"sorely unfounded.\\" Reviewer Jonathan Bradley noted that \\"Paramore attacks its music with infectious enthusiasm.\\" However, he also explained that \\"there isn't a whole lot of difference between Riot! and the songs from Kelly Clarkson or Avril Lavigne.\\" A reviewer at NME had likened Paramore's sound to that of \\"No Doubt (stripped of all the ska bollocks)\\" and \\"Kelly Clarkson's wildest dreams.\\" Hayley Williams has gone on to comment about the female aspect of the band saying that Paramore is not \\"this girl-fronted band\\" and it makes \\"music for people to enjoy music, not so people can talk about my sexuality.\\" Paramore has expressed appreciation for Fall Out Boy, Hanson, Panic! at the Disco, Blink-182, Death Cab for Cutie, Jimmy Eat World, MewithoutYou, and Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Thrice and New Found Glory; Hayley Williams has cited her personal influences as Elvis Presley, the Shirelles, the Angels, the Ramones, Jawbreaker, Radiohead, Green Day, Blondie, NSYNC, Destiny's Child, Aaliyah, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure and Etta James. Williams named many singers as heroines: \\"I love Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux. I grew up listening to The Distillers [...] Girl groups are really important to me, but the Shangri-Las especially\\". Williams also explained that bands such as U2, \\"who are massive, and do whatever they want, write whatever they want and they stand for something,\\" Jimmy Eat World, \\"who I don‚Äôt think ever disappoint their fans,\\" and No Doubt, who \\"have done amazing things,\\" act as a pattern for the path in which Paramore would like to take their career. In 2012, Williams contributed vocals to MewithoutYou's fifth studio album, Ten Stories. The band members are Christians and in an interview with the BBC, Josh Farro stated \\"Our faith is very important to us. It's obviously going to come out in our music because if someone believes something, then their worldview is going to come out in anything they do. But we're not out here to preach to kids, we're out here because we love music.\\" Live appearances Paramore performing at a concert during the Monumentour In 2007, the band played an acoustic set for the grand opening of a Warped Tour exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the dress Hayley Williams wore in the video for \\"Emergency\\" was also put on display in the exhibit. In June 2007, they were declared by Rolling Stone as \\"Ones to Watch\\". Paramore made their live television debut on Fuse Networks daily show, The Sauce. The second single from Riot!, \\"Hallelujah\\", was released on July 30, 2007, and is only available online and on UK television. The video, much like \\"All We Know\\", features backstage footage and live performances. In August 2007, Paramore had been featured in television spots on MTV, performing acoustic versions of their songs or acting in short accompaniments to MTV program commercials. As \\"MTV Artists of the Week\\", the band filmed the faux camping themed spots in Queens, New York, all written and directed by Evan Silver and Gina Fortunato. MTV.com also has a collection of short videos with the band to promote Riot! as well. For weeks in August 2007, the \\"Misery Business\\" video was the number one streamed video at MTV.com. On October 8, Paramore played \\"Misery Business\\" live on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, a booking made possible due to the friendship struck between the band and Max Weinberg during the 2007 Warped Tour. In August, Paramore participated in New Found Glory's music video for their cover of Sixpence None the Richer's song \\"Kiss Me\\". From September 29 to November 1, 2009, the band held a tour in North America to support Brand New Eyes. The tour for their self-titled fourth album, known as The Self-Titled Tour, took place in North America from October 15 to November 27, 2013. From June 19 through August 17, 2014, the band also supported the album with the Monumentour. Appearances in films and video games In 2005, Paramore made its first video game appearance with the song \\"Pressure\\" being featured in the console versions of the video game The Sims 2. In March 2008, Paramore made its first rhythm game appearance with \\"Crushcrushcrush\\" as a downloadable track in the Rock Band games and later being a playable song in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. Later that year, Rock Band 2 was released with the song \\"That's What You Get\\" included as a playable track. The video game Guitar Hero World Tour featured the song \\"Misery Business\\" along with Hayley Williams participating in motion capture sessions for the game. She is featured as an unlockable character in the game as well. \\"Misery Business\\" was also featured as a playable track on Rock Band 3, while \\"Pressure\\", \\"The Only Exception\\", \\"Brick by Boring Brick\\", and \\"Ignorance\\" are available as DLC for the game. In 2015 the song \\"Still Into You\\" was featured as an on-disc song for Rock Band 4. Paramore's song \\"Decode\\" was the lead single for the novel-based Twilight film. Another song called \\"I Caught Myself\\" is also featured on the film's soundtrack. \\"Decode\\" was released on October 1, 2008 on the Paramore Fan Club site as well as Stephenie Meyer's website. The band began shooting the video October 13 and it premiered on November 3. Hot Topic hosted listening parties for the soundtrack on October 24, 2008, and the album was released on November 4, 2008. Borders released an exclusive version of the soundtrack that features an acoustic version of \\"Decode.\\" \\"Misery Business\\" is also featured in Saints Row 2, and the soundtrack for EA Sports NHL 08. The music video for \\"Decode\\", along with the Twilight film trailer, was shown in the North American Home Theater of PlayStation Home from December 11, 2008, to December 18, 2008. The video premiered in full through MTV and its subsidiaries on November 3, 2008 one day ahead of the release of the soundtrack on which the song is featured. Paramore's song \\"Now\\" is featured as a song for the game Rocksmith 2014.

Lamar Avenue in Denison, Grayson County, in the U.S. state of Texas. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was born in the house on October 14, 1890, the first United States President to be born in Texas. Background Eisenhower's military success as Supreme Allied Commander Europe during World War II prompted local Denison school principal Jennie Jackson to correspond with General Eisenhower. She inquired if he was from the Eisenhower family she remembered in Denison. His family had moved to Kansas when he was two years old, and until he received Jackson's letter, he was unaware he had been born in Denison. Eisenhower's mother Ida Elizabeth Stover was still alive at the time, and he put his mother in touch with Jackson. Upon hearing from Eisenhower's mother that this was indeed his birthplace, Jackson set about to raise funds to purchase the two-story frame house. After the purchase, the house was then donated to the city of Denison, Texas. The museum was established in 1955. After Eisenhower was elected President, the Eisenhower Foundation was formed in 1953 for restoration. The Foundation created a park by removing several other houses in the nearby vicinity, and doing landscaping improvements. In 1958, the restored home and surrounding park was donated to the State Parks Board. On January 1, 2008, the Eisenhower Birthplace was transferred from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to the Texas Historical Commission. The home was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark.

It is headquartered in Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province. The flagship of the SSF is the AOR/AK Nanchang (953). Initially, the fleet's strength consisted mostly of former Kuomintang ships and personnel, which either defected or were captured by the People's Liberation Army. One of three fleets of the People's Liberation Army Navy, the SSF's duties were to protect the city of Guangzhou and the Pearl River regions, and support the PLA in capturing islands that were still in the hands of the Kuomintang forces. The fleet's development has been slow, because most of China's shipbuilding industry is located on the northern or eastern coasts. In the 1970s the fleet underwent a major buildup, due to conflict in the Paracel Islands and other reefs in the South China Sea. In 1974, the SSF took the Paracel Islands from South Vietnam, which resulted in the sinking of one South Vietnamese frigate while damaging another. The latest incident was in 1988, when a Chinese naval task force engaged Vietnamese naval forces, sinking one Vietnamese warship and damaging another. Most of the fleet's surface ships are located at Zhanjiang naval base, while all of the fleet's submarines are at Yulin Naval Base, on Hainan Island. The SSF has many other bases included Guangzhou, Haikou, Shantou, Mawei, and Beihai, while naval air force bases are at Lingshui, Haikou, Sanya, Zhanjiang, and Guiping. The fleet's area of operations is divided into six zones.

Early years Born in Summer Hill, New South Wales, the son of a baker, Long was a landscape artist in oils. He was raised in Mittagong on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and showed an early aptitude for drawing. He painted his first painting at the age of 16. He started his working life as a watch-maker in nearby Bowral later moving to Nowra for work. Early career As a young man Long was a cyclist and rode his push bike long distances including the trip from Nowra back to Mittagong to see his sweetheart Mary whom he later married. In 1934, he and Mary settled in Nowra where they raised their family. They had twins Ray and Barry in 1936 and a daughter Carmel in 1938. By 1939, Long had become more seriously interested in Landscape Painting and spent more and more of his spare time painting. After returning from his civil service during the Second World War as a precision instrument maker, he sold his watch-making business to his partner and began full-time painting in 1955. Exhibitions During his career, Long held many successful solo exhibitions throughout Australia and traveled extensively both within Australia and overseas. His first overseas trip was sponsored by the American millionaire John Galvin and the experience made a lasting impression on the artist. He knew and painted with many other Australian artists including Albert Namatjira. His works may be found in many private collections and is represented in many public galleries around the world. Older years Long moved to Melbourne in 1980. On 26 January 1993, Long was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia 'for service to the arts as a painter of Australian landscapes.' At the age of 100, Long continued to paint every day and staged his centenary exhibition on 14 May 2011 at Kim Nelson Fine Art & Editions in Yass, New South Wales, not far from the nation's capital, Canberra. He attributed his continued health to an active life and a medicinal scotch in the afternoon. Death Long died after a short illness on 3 November 2013 at the age of 102.

Ferrer (born October 30, 1968) is a US-based Spanish psychologist and participatory thinker, best known for his work bridging participatory theory with transpersonal psychology, religious studies, integral education, and sexuality and intimate relationships. Ferrer is a professor of psychology at California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS), San Francisco, where he served as chair of the department of East-West Psychology. Biography Born in Barcelona, Spain, Ferrer obtained a degree of clinical psychology in 1991 from University of Barcelona, studying his last year as an Erasmus scholar at Cardiff University (Wales, United Kingdom), where he was awarded the George Westby Prize for best essays written by an undergraduate student. Upon his return to Barcelona, the University and Research Commission of the Catalonian Council granted Ferrer a Research Training Fellowship (FPI) to carry out doctoral research on the ‚ÄúElectrophysiological and Hemispheric After-Effects of Mindfulness Meditation.‚Äù During this time, he taught his first classes (on psychobiology) at the School of Psychology of University of Barcelona. After completing the empirical part of his doctoral research in 1993, Ferrer traveled to the US to pursue another Ph.D. degree at California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) under the auspices of the prestigious ‚Äòla Caixa‚Äù Foundation Fellowship Program. In 1998, he began teaching at both CIIS and Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, and in 2000 he became core faculty at CIIS. Ferrer is considered one of the main architects of second-wave transpersonalism and his participatory approach to spirituality, religious pluralism, and integral education is widely discussed in academic journals and conferences. His participatory pedagogy is the focus of Yoshiharu Nakagawa and Yoshiko Matsuda‚Äôs Transformative Inquiry: An Integral Approach, an anthology of writings based on Ferrer‚Äôs teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan.Yoshiharu Nakagawa and Yoshiko Matsuda (Eds.), Transformative Inquiry: An Integral Approach. Kyoto, Japan: Institute of Human Sciences, Ritsumeikan University, 2010. In 2000, Ferrer received the Fetzer Institute‚Äôs Presidential Award for his seminal work on consciousness studies. From 2000 to 2010, he was a leading scholar at the Esalen Center for Theory and Research, Esalen Institute, California. In 2009, he was selected to become an advisor to the organization Religions for Peace at the United Nations on a research project aimed at solving global inter-religious conflict. In 2010, the American Academy of Religion Annual Meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, featured a panel on his co-edited anthology, The Participatory Turn. In 2015, Ferrer was interviewed by Pulitzer prize winner journalist Robert Wright in The Wright Show. He also featured in the 2016 documentary, ‚ÄúPostcolonial Knowledge.‚Äù In 2018, he was interviewed by Jeffrey Mishlove for New Thinking Allowed. Major Works and Ideas Ferrer‚Äôs writings are informed by a creative synthesis of Richard Tarnas‚Äôs participatory epistemology; Francisco Varela, Eleanor Rosch, and Evan Thompson‚Äôs enactive paradigm of cognition; Ramon Albareda and Marina Romero‚Äôs holistic approach;Jorge N. Ferrer, ‚ÄúIntegral Transformative Practice: A Participatory Perspective.‚Äù The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 35(1), 21-42, 2003. and Raimon Panikkar‚Äôs pluralistic account of religion. His philosophical approach is informed by the European traditions of romanticism and pragmatism (in particular, by the works of Johann Gottfried Herder and William James), Wilfrid Sellars‚Äôs critique of a pregiven world entirely independent from human cognition, Nagarjuna‚Äôs Buddhist thinking, and a plethora of contemplative and Indigenous traditions. Ferrer's work was also influenced by his friendships with other participatory thinkers such as J√ºrgen Kremer and John Heron. Ferrer signs his writings with his maternal surname (his paternal one is ‚ÄúNoguera‚Äù) to break with the patriarchal tradition. He sees central for our times ‚Äúthe emergence of a more feminine and organic spirituality, as well as the recovery of the authentically feminine.‚ÄùJordi Piguem, ‚ÄúPerfil: Jorge Ferrer. Explorador de Mentes.‚Äù Culturas La Vanguardia 120, p. 12, 2004. His first book, Revisioning Transpersonal Theory, was published in 2001 shortly after a preview by Tarnas arguing that the book represented a ‚Äúnew birth in freedom‚Äù for transpersonal psychologyRichard Tarnas, ‚ÄúA New Birth in Freedom: A (P)review of Jorge Ferrer‚Äôs Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.‚Äù The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 33(1), 64-71, 2001. Finding himself frustrated by the limiting assumptions and religious sectarianism he perceived in transpersonal psychology, Ferrer introduced a participatory alternative to the neo‚Äëperennialism dominating the field thus far. Ferrer‚Äôs participatory approach holds that human spirituality emerges from people‚Äôs co-creative participation in an undetermined mystery or generative power of life, the cosmos, or reality. He argued that spiritual participatory events can engage the entire range of human epistemic faculties (e.g., rational, imaginal, somatic, vital, aesthetic) with the creative unfolding of the mystery in the enactment‚Äîor ‚Äúbringing forth‚Äù‚Äîof a plurality of ontologically rich religious worlds. Through this proposal, Ferrer seeks to avoid both the secular post/modernist reduction of religion to cultural artifact and the religionist privileging of a single tradition as superior or paradigmatic. In 2008, Ferrer co-edited with Jacob H. Sherman The Participatory Turn, an anthology where they brought participatory thinking to bear on critical issues of contemporary religious studies. With the expression ‚Äúparticipatory turn,‚Äù Ferrer and Sherman claimed to articulate an emerging academic ethos capable of coherently weaving together some of the most challenging and robust trends in contemporary religious studies. Such trends included: the postcolonial revaluation of emic epistemologies, the postmodern emphasis on embodied and gendered subjectivity, the feminist recovery of the sensuous and the erotic in religious inquiry and experience, the pragmatist emphasis on transformation and antirepresentationalism, the renewed interest in the study of lived spirituality, the resacralization of language, the question of metaphysical truth in religion, and the irreducibility of religious pluralism. Ferrer and Sherman were joined in these efforts by influential scholars of religious studies such as William B. Barnard, William C. Chittick, Lee Irwin, Beverly Lanzetta, or Donald Rothberg. In 2017, Ferrer published Participation and the Mystery, applying his participatory approach to a variety of disciplines and critical issues, from integral practice to the question of supernatural claims, from entheogenic visions to the graduate teaching of mysticism, and from religious pluralism to integral education. Some examples: He claimed that the phenomenon of shared ‚Äúopen-eye‚Äù entheogenic visions not only raises a serious challenge to scientific naturalism (and materialism) but also suggests the existence of subtle dimensions of reality coexisting with the physical domain. To foster an embodied spirituality without dissociations (e.g., one leading to spiritual teachers‚Äô sexual abuses), he proposed an integral Bodhisattva vow in which the conscious mind renounces its own full liberation until the body and the primary world can be free as well. As for religious pluralism, he argued that the various approaches to religious diversity‚Äîexclusivism, inclusivism, and ecumenical pluralism‚Äîcan be situated along a continuum ranging from more gross to more subtle forms of spiritual narcissism, which ultimately elevates one‚Äôs favored tradition or spiritual choice as superior. He also introduced embodied spiritual inquiry‚Äîa participatory pedagogy and methodology Ferrer developed at CIIS integrating Albareda and Romero‚Äôs holistic meditation and central aspects of Heron‚Äôs cooperative inquiry paradigm. Ferrer‚Äôs most recent work appears to be focused on the area of sexuality and intimate relationships, where he applied the same pluralistic-pragmatic approach taken toward spiritual paths. While critiquing the ‚Äúmononormative‚Äù character of mainstream Western culture (where sexual monogamy is socially enforced and considered natural or optimal), he denounced the ideological nature of what he called the ‚Äúmono-poly wars,‚Äù in which monogamists and polyamorists condescendingly look down at one another as somehow flawed, misguided, or ‚Äúinferior.‚Äù Alternatively, he argued that people have diverse relational dispositions, that social conditions and developmental needs can call individuals to engage in different relationship styles at various junctures of their lives, that there are more and less mature forms of both monogamy and polyamory, that people can follow a specific relationship style for the ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù reasons, and that all relationship styles can become equally limiting ideologies.Ferrer, ‚ÄúMononormativity, Polypride, and the ‚ÄúMono-Poly Wars.‚Äù Sexuality and Culture, 22, 817-836, 2018. Furthermore, in the same way that the transgender movement deconstructed the gender binary, Ferrer proposed that a parallel step should be taken with the relational style binary. Ferrer coined the term nougamy as a way to refer to a diverse array of relational options beyond the mono/poly binary. He also outlined a critical pluralist stance that eschews universal hierarchies among monogamy, nonmonogamy, and nougamy, as well as provides tools for critical discernment to assess relational styles.Ferrer, ‚ÄúBeyond the Non/Monogamy system: Fluidity, Hybridity, and Transcendence in Intimate Relationships.‚Äù Psychology and Sexuality, 9(1), 3-20, 2018. Reception and criticism The publication of Revisioning Transpersonal Theory in 2001 proved to be catalytic for the development of the so-called second-wave transpersonalism, which stresses the embodied, embedded, diverse, and transformative aspects of human spirituality.Glenn Hartelius et al. ‚ÄúSecond Wave Transpersonal Psychology: Embodied, Embedded, Diverse, Transformative.‚Äù Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, forthcoming. In the foreword, Tarnas framed Ferrer‚Äôs participatory approach as the second conceptual stage of the paradigm shift initiated by Abraham Maslow‚Äôs and Stanislav Grof‚Äôs launching of the discipline of transpersonal psychology.Tarnas, ‚ÄúForeword,‚Äù Revisioning Transpersonal Theory, 2001. Both Gregg Lahood and Edward Dale considered participatory pluralism as shaping the prevalent growing force in transpersonal scholarship in the twenty‚Äëfirst century, after Ken Wilber‚Äôs hierarchical neo‚Äëperennialism and the East‚ÄëWest synthesis of the 1960s and 1970s that spawned the birth of transpersonal psychology.Gregg Lahood, ‚ÄúThe Participatory Turn and the Transpersonal Movement: A Brief Introduction.‚Äù ReVision: A Journal of Consciousness and Transformation, 29(3), 2‚Äì6, 2007; Edward J. Dale, Completing Piaget‚Äôs Project: Transpersonal Philosophy and the Future of Psychology. St. Paul, MN: Paragon House, 2014. Ferrer‚Äôs ideas have often been discussed and debated (sometimes heatedly) within the pages of various peer-reviewed academic journals, including Journal of Consciousness Studies, International Journal of Transpersonal Studies, and Journal of Transpersonal Psychology. The harshest criticisms came from Wilber and his students, which is perhaps understandable as the publication of Revisioning arguably influenced Wilber‚Äôs departure from the field.Ken Wilber, ‚ÄúThe Demise of Transpersonal Psychology.‚Äù From:‚Äù On Critics, Integral Institute, my Recent Writing, and Other Matters of Little Consequence: A Shambhala Interview with Ken Wilber,‚Äù 2002.

Ferrer.‚Äù Journal of Transpersonal Research, 5(2), 97-111, 2013. In October of 2001, a month before the publication of Revisioning, Wilber suggested that Ferrer‚Äîtogether with figures such as Richard Rorty, Jean Baudrillard, Edward Said, and the late Wittgenstein‚Äîwas responsible for the cultural confusion leading to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Piguem, ‚ÄúPerfil: Jorge Ferrer. Explorador de Mentes.‚Äù Daryl Paulson claimed that anything of value in the book had been already said by Wilber, and the rest was, citing a personal communication from Wilber, ‚Äúa condensation of three decades of postmodern wrong turns ‚Ä¶ Ferrer‚Äôs book basically marks the end of the transpersonal movement.‚ÄùDaryl S. Paulson, ‚ÄúDaryl Paulson on Jorge Ferrer‚Äôs Revisioning Transpersonal Theory,‚Äù para. 43, 2002. Retrieved from http://www.integralworld.net/abramson1.html. One year later, however, Paulson retracted these views, stating: ‚ÄúWhen I first read this book I hated it, but I have read and studied it for 2 years and find it one of the best books ever written on transpersonal psychology.‚ÄùPaulson, ‚ÄúAmazon.com Review of Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality, by Jorge N.

In addition, Wilber wrote an essay charging Revisioning with falling into a performative contradiction (i.e., critiquing hierarchical rankings while upholding the superiority of its own approach) and promoting what he called a flatland where no qualitative distinctions can be made.Wilber, ‚ÄúParticipatory Samsara: The Green-Meme Approach to the Mystery of the Divine,‚Äù 2002. Retrieved from http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/boomeritis/sidebar_f/index.cfm/ Ferrer responded stating that these critiques do not apply to his work. He argued that although his proposal does not privilege any tradition or type of spirituality on doctrinal, objectivist, or ontological grounds (i.e., saying that theism, monism, or nondualism corresponds to the nature of ultimate reality or is intrinsically superior), it does offer criteria for making qualitative distinctions on pragmatist and transformational grounds.Ferrer, ‚ÄúParticipatory Spirituality and Transpersonal Theory: A Ten-Year Retrospective,‚Äù The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 43(1), 2011. In the context of religious studies, Ferrer‚Äôs ‚Äúparticipatory turn‚Äù has so far had a moderately significant impact, receiving many positive reviews in both peer- reviewed academic journals and culturally impacting magazines.Such as: Sophia, Journal of Contemporary Religion, Spiritus: A Journal of Christian Spirituality, Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review, Journal for the Study of Spirituality, Tikkun, Network Review: Journal of the Scientific and Medical Network, Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, Resurgence, and Journal of Integral Theory and Practice. A review by Ellen Goldberg in Sophia described the book thus: ‚Äúoffers a sophisticated and complex look at an emerging orientation that will continue to be part of the internal dialogue within religious studies. As such, Ferrer and Sherman provide a timely contribution that is thoughtful and worthy of debate within the academy for many years to come.‚ÄùA review by Ellen Goldberg in Sophia described the book thus: ‚Äúoffers a sophisticated and complex look at an emerging orientation that will continue to be part of the internal dialogue within religious studies.

N. Ferrer and J. H. > Sherman.‚Äù Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review, 2(1), 125, 2011. In the UK, a review by Chris Clarke in Network Review: Journal of the Scientific and Medical Network said: ‚ÄúThe Participatory Turn ‚Ä¶ present[s] a powerfully convincing picture of what may be the most significant philosophical turn since Kant.‚ÄùChris Clarke, ‚ÄúThe Reinvention of Religion.

Sherman.‚Äù Network Review: Journal of the Scientific and Medical Network, 100, 55, 2009. In addition, the Buddhist scholar Douglas Duckworth published a paper in Sophia presenting participatory pluralism as a less sectarian alternative to Tibetan Buddhist inclusivism. He wrote: > His [Ferrer‚Äôs] most significant contribution may be in illustrating what a > ‚Äúnonsectarian‚Äù stance might look like in a contemporary, religiously diverse > world. While doing so, he shows us what is lost, and what is gained, if we > adopt such a truly ‚Äúnonsectarian‚Äù or pluralist stance: what we stand to lose > is our particular version of a determinate ultimate truth and a fixed > referent of what the end religious goal looks like; what we stand to gain is > the real possibility of a transformative dialogue with different traditions, > and a new, open relation to the world, ourselves, and each other.Douglas > Duckworth, ‚ÄúHow Nonsectarian is ‚ÄúNonsectarian‚Äù?: Jorge Ferrer‚Äôs Religious > Pluralist Alternative to Tibetan Buddhist Inclusivism.‚Äù Sophia, 53(3), 343, > 2014. The cultural philosopher Jay Ogilvy suggested that Ferrer‚Äôs ‚Äúnew polytheism‚Äù represented not only a ‚Äúspirituality that does justice to the multi‚Äëcultural condition of a globalized world,‚Äù but also the best response to the criticisms of religion crafted by the so‚Äëcalled new atheists such as Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, or Sam Harris.Jay Ogilvy, ‚ÄúThe New Polytheism: Updating the Dialogue between East and West.‚Äù East/West Affairs, 1(2), 43, 2013. More practically, it has been argued not only that Ferrer‚Äôs participatory theory can explain the phenomenon of multiple religious identity, but also that ‚Äúframing spiritual identity as a participatory event‚Ä¶can generate possibilities for a Buddhist‚ÄëChristian dialogue less constrained by‚Ä¶doctrinal, ontological, and anthropological tensions.‚ÄùDuane R.

The museum is home to the Kirkpatrick Planetarium and a number of specialized galleries. History The museum began as the Kirkpatrick Planetarium in 1958, which moved to a permanent dome at the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds in 1962. Later that year, the Oklahoma Science and Arts Foundation was founded on the fairgrounds. In 1978 the foundation changed its name to Omniplex Science Museum, then moved with the Kirkpatrick Planetarium to the newly built Kirkpatrick Center museum campus. Later additions include the Oklahoma Air and Space Museum in 1980, the Kirkpatrick Gardens and Greenhouse in 1985, and the OmniDome Theater, Oklahoma's first large-format, dome-screen theater, which opened in 2000. In 2007 Omniplex changed its name to Science Museum Oklahoma. Since the rebranding the museum has undergone extensive remodeling, adding numerous new exhibits and galleries, including a kid-friendly space exhibit and art galleries. CurioCity CurioCity, pronounced \\"curiosity,\\" is a 20,000-square-foot village featuring eight whimsical neighborhoods where familiar meets the fanciful as children get a taste of the wonderful world of science. Each neighborhood has its own personality that allows you the opportunity to explore a scientific concept utilizing interactive devices and unusual settings to encourage learning through play. A children's museum inside a museum, larger than most children's museums in the nation. Destination Space Kirkpatrick Air and Space Museum This section of the museum preserves and honors the contributions of Oklahomans to aerospace. Notable artifacts include the Apollo Command Module simulator, an Apollo Lunar Module replica built by Canadian inventor William Lishman, and artifacts related to Oklahoman aviator Wiley Post. Some of the artifacts are currently on loan to the Oklahoma History Center, which opened in November 2005. Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame The museum houses the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame, which has a new first floor exhibit with an interactive kiosk featuring pictures and biographies of the inductees. One of the inductees is Eula Pearl Carter Scott. The main exhibit hall with historical exhibits including full-scale models of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules as well as the actual Apollo Command Module Simulator used to train Apollo astronauts, is currently closed for construction. The room can still be seen from a balcony in an obscure AWAC exhibit.

In 1883, while at the yeshiva, he enrolled at the Vilnius School of Drawing, where he was a student until June 1885. In 1887, he met the Jewish sculptor Mark Antokolsky, who was visiting his parents. He showed Antokolski a small figurine of a Jew in a prayer shawl he had carved from black stone. Antokolsky secured a stipend for Schatz and encouraged him to apply for the St. Petersburg Academy of Art, but the plan to study there did not work out. Meanwhile, he began to teach drawing privately in Vilnius. In 1888, he moved to Warsaw and taught art in Jewish schools. His first sculpture ‚ÄúHendel,‚Äù created in Warsaw, is an ode to the Jewish peddler.Prof. Boris Schatz In the summer of 1889, Schatz married Eugenia (Genia) Zhirmunsky.Boris Schatz: The Father of Israeli Art, Yigal Zalmona, The Israel Museum, 2006, p.7 In 1889, Schatz moved to Paris with wife to study painting at the Acad√©mie Cormon and sculpture under Antokolski. In 1890, they lived in a small French town, Banyuls-sur-Mer, for six months. In 1894 Schatz gained recognition for his sculpture \\"Mattathias the Maccabee\\" (present location unknown). At the end of 1895, Schatz moved to Sofia, Bulgaria, at the invitation of Prince Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, where his daughter Angelika was born in 1897. Genia left him for a student of Schatz's, Andrey Nikolov, later a well-known Bulgarian sculptor, and took Angelika with her.Boris Schatz: The Father of Israeli Art, Yigal Zalmona, The Israel Museum, 2006, p.7 Boris Schatz, 1912 In March 1904, Schatz sailed to the United States to oversee the construction of the Bulgarian Pavilion at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. He remained in the country for ten months, until the end of December 1904. Back in Sofia, he declared himself in love with 16-year-old Theodora (Dora) Gabe, later a renowned Bulgarian poet and children's author. In 1905, heartbroken when she did not return his affection, Schatz left for Berlin, where he stayed with the Zionist illustrator Ephraim Moses Lilien. Lilien introduced him to Franz Oppenheimer, a supporter of cooperative land settlement in Israel, and Otto Warburg, later president of the World Zionist Organization. Both were enthusiastic about his idea of establishing an art school in Jerusalem. The founding of Bezalel was officially proclaimed on October 8, 1905.Boris Schatz: The Father of Israeli Art, Yigal Zalmona, The Israel Museum, 2006, p.20-21 In 1911, Schatz married Olga Pevzner, a writer and art history teacher.Boris Schatz: The Father of Israeli Art, Yigal Zalmona, The Israel Museum, 2006, p.7 Their children Zahara Schatz (1916‚Äì1999) and Bezalel Schatz (1912‚Äì1978), nicknamed Lilik, were also artists.Prof. Schatz's wayward children, Haaretz Angelika became a painter, too, gaining recognition in the 1930s in France and Bulgaria. For many years, it was believed the relationship ended when Genia and Boris Schatz divorced. Letters discovered in the Central Zionist Archives reveal that they remained in touch.Central Zionist Archives: Angelica Schatz Head of Schatz's daughter Angelika The 1955 Israel Prize for Art was awarded to Zahara in recognition of the whole Schatz family. While living on the shore of the Sea of Galilee during the First World War, Shatz wrote a futurist novel entitled The Rebuilt Jerusalem (Yerushalayim Ha-Benuya) in which Bezalel ben Uri, the Biblical architect of the Mishkan appears at the Bezalel School and takes Schatz on a tour of Israel in the year 2018.The Temple of Jerusalem: From Moses to the Messiah Schatz died while on a fundraising tour in Denver, Colorado in 1932. Art career Copper relief of Jewish scribe, Boris Schatz (1912) In 1895, Schatz accepted an invitation from Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria to become the official court sculptor and to establish that country's Royal Academy of Art. In 1900, he received a gold medal for his statue, Bust of an Old Woman. Mattathias the Maccabee, Boris Schatz (1894) Three years later, in 1903, he met Theodor Herzl and became an ardent Zionist. At the Fifth Zionist Congress of 1905, he proposed creating a Jewish art school. In 1906 he founded an art center in Jerusalem, later named \\"Bezalel\\" after Bezalel Ben Uri, the biblical artisan who designed the Tabernacle and its ritual objects. In the following years, Schatz organized exhibitions of his students' work in Europe and the United States; they were the first international exhibitions of Jewish artists from Palestine. Schatz, a fiery visionary, wrote in his will: \\"To my teachers and assistants at Bezalel I give my final thanks for their hard work in the name of the Bezalel ideal. Moreover, I beg forgiveness from you for the great precision that I sometimes demanded of you and that perhaps caused some resentment ... The trouble was that Bezalel was founded before its time, and the Zionists were not yet capable of understanding it.\\" Schatz's will was publicized for the first time in 2005.Prof. Schatz's wayward children, Haaretz Bezalel art school Bezalel opened on Ethiopia Street in Jerusalem in 1906. The school's stated goals were \\"to train the people of Jerusalem in crafts, develop original Jewish art and support Jewish artists, and to find visual expression for the much yearned-for national and spiritual independence that seeks to create a synthesis between European artistic traditions and the Jewish design traditions of the East and West, and to integrate it with the local culture of the Land of Israel.‚Äù In 1908, the school moved to a permanent home on what became Shmuel Hanagid Street, which allowed more departments to be opened and the scope of activities expanded.Bezalel landmarks Of the three buildings Schatz purchased from a wealthy Palestinian Arab. one was his personal residence and the other two housed the art school and a national art museum. The school was established based on the Russian concept of an arts and crafts school and workshop. Bezalel's motto was \\"Art is the bud, craft is the fruit.\\"Zionism and Art The school offered instruction in painting and sculpture alongside crafts such as carpet making, metalworking and woodcarving.From Bezalel to the Artists‚Äô House In the wake of financial difficulties, the school closed in 1929. Schatz died while fundraising on behalf of the school in the United States. His body was brought back to Jerusalem and buried on the Mount of Olives.

It is now on the campus of Southern Maine Community College. Construction Secretary of War Henry Dearborn authorized construction of Fort Preble in 1808 with his son, Massachusetts Militia officer and future general Henry A. S. Dearborn, supervising the construction. The fort was named in honor of Commodore Edward Preble, who led a squadron of American warships during the Barbary Wars. Preble died in Portland in 1807 and is buried there. The initial construction at Fort Preble was part of the Second System of US fortifications. It was a star fort made of stone, brick, and sod, with 14 heavy guns including two 50-pounder (7.25-inch, 184 mm) Columbiads.Wade, p. 139 The fort is described in the Secretary of War's report for December 1811 as \\"an enclosed star fort of masonry, with a circular battery with flanks; mounting 14 heavy guns (with) barracks for one company\\".Wade, p. 241 Along with Fort Scammell on nearby House Island, Fort Preble was built to deter attack by a hostile power in the event the United States was considered a belligerent in the ongoing conflict between Great Britain and Napoleonic France. In October 1808, Dearborn ordered a company of the Regiment of Light Artillery under Captain Joseph Chandler to occupy the fort and instructed them to do whatever was necessary to enforce the Embargo Act against embargo-breaking ships.Wade, p. 131 The embargo was an attempt to punish Britain and France for actions against US shipping by prohibiting exports to them; it cut off much of New England's income and was highly unpopular. The embargo was finally lifted in March 1809 when President James Madison took office, but the situation eventually led to the War of 1812. War of 1812 Various units manned Fort Preble during the War of 1812. Among them were elements of the Regiment of Light Artillery, the 21st, 33rd, and 34th Regiments of Infantry, as well as US Volunteers, and in times of crisis local militia. When Winfield Scott and other American soldiers returned from British imprisonment in Quebec, they were landed at Fort Preble. Many of them were emaciated and ill, and some died at the post's hospital. From 1848‚Äì1849 and from 1851‚Äì1853, Fort Preble was commanded by Captain Robert Anderson who would become famous for his heroic defense of Fort Sumter at the start of the Civil War. Fort Preble received new batteries circa 1845, a 12-gun North Battery and a 10-gun South Battery.FortWiki article on Fort Preble Civil War During the American Civil War, Fort Preble became the headquarters and recruiting depot of the 17th US Infantry Regiment and was also mobilization site for volunteer regiments recruited in Maine. Soldiers from the fort saw action when Confederate Army raiders entered Portland Harbor on June 26, 1863, aboard a captured ship named Archer. The Confederates captured the United States Revenue Cutter Caleb Cushing the next day, and attempted an escape in an action known as the Battle of Portland Harbor. They were pursued by two steamers carrying soldiers and artillery pieces from Fort Preble, as well as about 100 civilian volunteers. Light wind made escape impossible and the Confederates abandoned the Caleb Cushing in boats after setting the ship on fire. The fire detonated the ship's magazines and the Cushing was destroyed by the explosion. Twenty-three Confederate prisoners were captured and taken to Fort Preble. They remained at Fort Preble until they were transferred to prisoner of war camps. During this action, Fort Preble was commanded by Major George Lippitt Andrews. (Not to be confused with Brevet Major General George Leonard Andrews.) Andrews was a native of Rhode Island who was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 1st Missouri Infantry at the start of the war. He was mustered out of volunteer service in September 1861 and was commissioned in the Regular Army as the major of the 17th Infantry. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1864. In January 1871 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as commander of the 25th Infantry, one of the Regular Army's four African-American regiments at the time. He commanded the 25th Infantry for 21 years until he retired from the Army in 1892.Heitman, Francis B., Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army, 1789-1903, Vol. 1, p. 166. On 15 July 1863, Billy Laird, a private in the 17th Maine Regiment, was executed by firing squad at Fort Preble after being charged with desertion. President Abraham Lincoln pardoned Laird but the telegraph message never got through due to the fact the telegraph wires in New York City which relayed the message from Washington, D.C. to Maine were cut during the July 1863 draft riots. Laird was the only Maine soldier in the Civil War to be executed for desertion. Construction on a major expansion of Fort Preble was undertaken during the Civil War. The old star fort remained to cover the land approach, and new granite casemates typical of the Third System were to be built on the three water sides of the fort. Only a single tier of guns was projected. This project was abandoned incomplete, with some of the casemates remaining to the present.Weaver, pp. 98‚Äì100 Post Civil War In the 1870s Fort Preble was modernized under the supervision of Army engineer Thomas Lincoln Casey, who is best known for overseeing the completion of the Washington Monument. These improvements included added emplacements for large caliber guns (typically 8-inch converted rifles) behind earthen parapets, as masonry walls were found to be ineffective against rifled artillery shells. Twentieth century Two M1890MI 12-inch mortars at Fort DeSoto, FL, similar to those at Fort Preble. One of the six-inch disappearing gun emplacements of Battery Rivardi In 1896‚Äì1906 several modern Endicott era coast defense batteries were installed at the fort as part of the Coast Defenses of Portland, which also included Fort Williams, Fort McKinley, and Fort Levett. The star fort was demolished to make room for these batteries. Batteries Kearny and Chase totaled sixteen 12-inch mortars (305 mm) and were completed in 1901. These were named for Brigadier General Stephen W. Kearny of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and Lt. Colonel Constantine Chase of the Civil War. Originally all sixteen mortars were Battery Kearny, but Battery Chase was named in 1906, with each battery comprising eight mortars. They were followed in 1906 by Battery Rivardi with two \\"disappearing\\" 6-inch (152 mm) guns and Battery Mason with one 3-inch (76 mm) gun. Battery Rivardi was named for John J. U. Rivardi of the 1st US Artillerists and Engineers, who served 1795‚Äì1802 and worked on the First System forts.Ward, p. 30 Battery Mason was named for Philip D. Mason, an artillery officer killed in the Civil War.Berhow, p.202 Two mortars from Battery Kearny-Chase were moved to West Point in 1911, probably to instruct cadets in their use. The fort remained active through World War I, but was partially disarmed as part of a program to send heavy artillery and railway artillery to the Western Front. Battery Rivardi's two 6-inch guns were shipped to France for use as field guns in 1917 and were not returned to the fort. Six mortars from Batteries Kearny and Chase were removed in 1918‚Äì19 for use as railway mortars; this was part of a general halving of mortars to alleviate overcrowding of their emplacements during reloading. This left Fort Preble with eight mortars and one 3-inch gun. Two gun platforms in front of Battery Rivardi were for 3-inch antiaircraft guns installed at many coast defense installations in the World War I era. In 1924, the Coast Artillery adopted a regimental organization, and the Regular Army's 8th Coast Artillery Regiment was formed at Fort Preble. A reserve regiment to supplement the regular forces in wartime was also formed, the 240th Coast Artillery of the Maine National Guard. Both of these regiments garrisoned the Harbor Defenses of Portland during early World War II, in which Fort Preble was a naval net depot for net laying ships and a control station for the Casco Bay degaussing range. All remaining mortars were scrapped in 1942; Fort Preble was superseded by new defenses centered on Battery Steele on Peaks Island. Only one 3-inch gun remained, which was removed in 1946. After World War II it was determined that coast defense forts were obsolete and Fort Preble, along with most forts of its kind, was inactivated in 1950. Educational institution In 1952 the fort was sold to the State of Maine and became the campus of the Southern Maine Vocational Technical Institute (SMVTI) which was renamed In 1989 as Southern Maine Technical College (SMTC) and later to Southern Maine Community College (SMCC). Some of Fort Preble's original early 20th Century brick buildings (including officers' quarters, barracks and a fire station) remain and are in a good state of preservation. Spring Point Ledge Light was built near the site in 1897. A granite breakwater that extends from the fort and surrounds the lighthouse was later added in 1951.

A versatile scholar, he made great contributions to mathematics, geography, phonology and philosophy. His philosophical and philological critiques of Neo-Confucianism continue to be influential. Dai's philosophical contributions included those to the Han Learning school of Evidential Learning (Evidentialism) which criticized the Song Learning school of Neo-Confucianism. In particular, two criticisms that Dai made was: First, Neo-Confucianism focused too much on introspective self- examination whereas truth was to be found in investigation of the external world. Second, he criticized the Neo-Confucian drive to eliminate human desire as an obstacle to rational investigation. Dai argued that human desire was a good and integral part of the human experience, and that eliminating human desire from philosophy had the bad effect of making it difficult to understand and control one's emotions as well as making it impossible to establish empathy with others.

The storm formed near Cape Verde on August 4 and crossed the Atlantic, turning northward around Bermuda before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while situated southeast of Newfoundland. Irene proved to be a difficult storm to forecast due to oscillations in strength. After almost dissipating on August 10, Irene peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16. Irene persisted for 14 days as a tropical system, the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season. It was the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the record-breaking season. Although there were initial fears of a landfall in the United States due to uncertainty in predicting the storm's track, Hurricane Irene never approached land and caused no recorded damage; however, swells up to and strong rip currents resulted in one fatality in Long Beach, New York. Meteorological history Hurricane Irene began as a Cape Verde storm. A vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on August 1, initially weakening due to cooler sea surface temperatures. It moved westward and passed near Cape Verde, where convection started to increase. The system subsequently developed into a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 4, 690 miles (1100 km) southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Early on August 5, the depression abruptly turned to the northwest into an area of higher wind shear, causing some computer models to predict that the depression would dissipate, while others predicted steady strengthening. The sudden threat to the storm's existence prompted National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecaster Lixion Avila to comment, \\"How little we know about the genesis of tropical cyclones.\\" Despite the unfavorable conditions in its vicinity and its poor organization, Tropical Depression Nine continued to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Irene on August 7. Because Irene was in an environment laden with dry air and high shear, it soon weakened to a tropical depression, on August 8. On the morning of August 10, as it was passing north of the Lesser Antilles, Irene nearly dissipated into a remnant low, but forecasters predicted with \\"very low confidence\\" that the storm would survive. Contrary to these expectations, warmer waters and less wind shear allowed Irene to become gradually more organized while south of Bermuda, and it became a tropical storm once again early on August 11. Tropical Storm Irene off the United States East Coast on August 14 Due to uncertainties about how the region's subtropical ridge would interact with Irene, the models continued to give unclear signals of the storm's future. Some of the models predicted that Irene would make landfall in North Carolina, while others continued to anticipate that Irene would dissipate. The uncertainty ended when a weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed Irene to turn sharply northward, which caused the storm to pass midway between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda on August 15. Soon after, upper-level shear weakened greatly, and Irene rapidly intensified, first to a hurricane, then to its peak strength as a 105 mph (170 km/h) Category 2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 16, while located 350 miles (560 km) northeast of Bermuda; at the same time it also attained minimum pressure of 970 mbar. Though NHC meteorologists thought it was likely that Irene would become a hurricane, they were not expecting an intensification of such a magnitude. Irene entered a region of increased wind shear and began to weaken, and as a result it was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 18, when it was 520 miles (830 km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. All convection within 230 mi (370 km) of the cyclone dissipated on August 18\\\\. Irene was subsequently absorbed by an extratropical cyclone later that day. Irene lasted for 14 days as a tropical system, the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season. Impact and records As Hurricane Irene stayed well away from land, no coastal warnings or watches were issued for it. Despite Irene's long life there were no reports of tropical storm force winds affecting ships. There was no damage as a result of Irene. However, the hurricane generated strong waves and increased the risk of rip currents along the East Coast of the United States.

It boasts scenery similar to the nearby Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, with the added conveniences of road access, modern facilities, and motorboating. The most popular visitor activities are boating, fishing, swimming, and hiking. The park entirely surrounds Bear Head Lake and three other fishing lakes. It was established in 1961 in Saint Louis County near Ely, Minnesota. The park also contains the woodlands surrounding the lakes, which gives an entire total of about 5,540 acres. The park also shares a large border with Bear Island State Forest. In September 2010, Bear Head Lake State Park was voted \\"America's Favorite Park\\" in a major online poll. The little- known park, not even among Minnesota's most popular, won in a surprise landslide, capturing 28% of the more than 5.7 million votes. The strong showing was credited to the online fan community of mother and cub black bears, featured on a popular webcam, whose territory included the park. Geography Bear Head Lake State Park is located in Saint Louis County, southwest of Ely; and east of Tower. The park is located 6 miles south of the junction of State Highway 169 (MN 169) and County Road 128 in Eagles Nest Township. The park entrance is located on County Road 128. Elevation ranges from . The Laurentian Divide crosses the southern end of the park. The park completely surrounds Bear Head and four smaller lakes and includes partial shoreline of three others. Bear Head Lake has of shoreline, an average depth of , and a maximum depth of . The northwest corner of the park includes of shore on Eagles Nest Lake No. 3, almost half of the lake's shoreline. Blueberry Lake and Square Lake near the southeast corner are and respectively. Near the park road, Cub Lake covers with a maximum depth of while Norberg Lake reaches deep. Grassy Lake straddles the eastern boundary, with of shoreline within the park; a quarter of its total. Numerous other ponds and bogs dot Bear Head Lake State Park. Although its statutory boundary covers , this figure omits lake surfaces, which would bring the total to . Bear Head Lake State Park is largely bordered by Bear Island State Forest. Parts of Superior National Forest are within , and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness lies away. Natural history=Geology Bear Head Lake State Park's topography ranges from rolling to very steep, with rocky ridges and hills interspersed with lakes and bogs. Bedrock crops out in many places through the thin glacial soil. Two Archean formations comprise the bedrock. The eastern half of the park is underlain by Giants Range Granite; elsewhere by the Ely greenstone belt. The iron-rich greenstone is metamorphosed pillow lava erupted from underwater volcanoes. A succession of ice ages scoured the region down to the 2,700-million-year-old bedrock. The last glacial period from 12,000 to 10,000 years ago deposited stony till only about thick, as well as the Walston and Vermillion moraines. These two terminal moraines were formed at different periods of the glacier's retreat, leaving thick ridges of sandy debris across the landscape. Flora Floating logs on Cub Lake support bog plants Bear Head Lake State Park is mostly forested, with several different plant communities based on soil and location. Human activity has altered the forest composition significantly since European settlement. The park's pre-contact vegetation would have been dominated by eastern white pine and red pine, with jack pine barrens and openings. The tall pines in the picnic area are remnants of this old growth forest. However extensive logging around 1900 and subsequent wildfires, followed by years of strict wildfire suppression, have produced a much-altered secondary forest throughout much of the park. Three coniferous swamp communities intermix in areas of peaty soil in the park. Black spruce bogs have a dense canopy of black spruce, a shrub layer of black spruce and speckled alder, an understory of bog Labrador tea or leatherleaf depending on shadiness, and a ground cover of sphagnum. Tamarack bogs have an open canopy of tamarack with plenty of black spruce, a shrub layer of speckled alder and dwarf birch, and a very dense understory of leatherleaf with bog- laurel and bog-rosemary over sphagnum. White cedar swamps are characterized by northern white cedar with black spruce and balsam fir, dense speckled alder shrubs, and less understory and sphagnum than the other communities. Less- wooded shrub swamps are composed of speckled alder, red osier dogwood, and willow, with an understory of meadowsweet, leatherleaf, and heath. The ground cover is a mix of grasses, mosses, and soil litter. The park bears three distinct upland forest types. Pine forest grows on level areas, ridgetops, and lakeshores. Its canopy is a mix of red and white pine with balsam fir, quaking aspen, and paper birch with occasional jack pine. The shrub layer varies inversely with the density of the canopy, and comprises beaked hazel, juneberry, blueberry, and bush honeysuckle. Aspen‚Äìbirch forest occurs as an early-succession cover type on the moraines, the last areas of the park to be logged. Its canopy is dominated by trembling aspen and paper birch, with balsam fir and red and white pine. Beaked hazel dominates the dense shrub layer, while ground cover is characterized by bracken fern and forbs such as largeleaf aster and sarsaparilla. Lastly the shallow upland till soils support aspen‚Äìbirch‚Äìfir forest. Trembling aspen, paper birch, and balsam fir are of course dominant, with some black and white spruce, red and white pine, and white cedar. Beaked hazel and mountain maple comprise the modest shrub layer, while the ground cover is more litter and grasses than forbs. Fauna Surrounded by lightly populated forestland, Bear Head Lake State Park supports a fuller range of species than many parks ringed by human development. Large mammals such as moose, black bears, and timber wolves are present. More commonly seen, though, are white-tailed deer, red foxes, snowshoe hares, red squirrels, and eastern chipmunks. Other species include beavers, river otters, masked shrews, least chipmunks, southern red-backed voles, and meadow voles. The park provides summer breeding habitat for numerous birds, but only a few species remain over winter. Classic Boundary Waters birds like the common loon, bald eagle, osprey, common raven, and Canada jay are all present. Other notable residents include the red-breasted nuthatch, pine grosbeak, red crossbill, and boreal chickadee. Each forest type attracts its own subset of summer birds. The aspen‚Äìbirch community supports ovenbirds, red-eyed vireos, veeries, ruffed grouse, black-capped chickadees, least flycatchers, and black- throated green warblers. The same species appear in the aspen‚Äìbirch‚Äìfir forest with the addition of white-throated sparrows, magnolia warblers, yellow-rumped warblers, and winter wrens. The most common overwinterers are black-capped chickadees, gray jays, pine grosbeaks, and hairy and downy woodpeckers. Specific to the pine forests are Blackburnian warblers, hermit thrushes, eastern wood pewees, golden-crowned kinglets, brown creepers, and red-breasted nuthatches. The most common birds of prey are broad-winged hawks and American kestrels, followed by red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, and barred owls. Water birds include the loon, great blue heron, common merganser, spotted sandpiper, and herring gull. Cultural history=Prehistory and settlement The past of the Bear Head Lake area is only poorly known. Native American archaeological sites have been found outside the park dating back to 4000 BCE. European fur traders entered the region in the late 18th century, building economic ties with the local Native Americans. The 1854 Treaty of La Pointe enabled Euro-American settlement and industry in the Arrowhead Region. A gold mine was established in the north-central part of the future park in 1885, but found nothing. Logging began around Bear Head Lake in 1895, and a sawmill operated on the south shore. The mill was built by the Allen and Whittenburg Company in 1907, sold to the Tower Lumber Company after two seasons, and dismantled in 1911. A logging railroad served the sawmill while another skirted the north end of the lake. Portions of both railbeds are still discernible in the park. Also visible are charred stumps from numerous slash fires between 1911 and 1913. After being logged over, the area saw little activity beyond a few private lake cabins. Park creation Created largely on property already owned by the state, Bear Head Lake State Park was established quickly and smoothly. In 1959 two officials from the Division of Forestry were inspecting a new road to Bear Head Lake and were impressed with its potential as a state park. They shared their recommendation with the Division of Parks and Trails and started building local support. Iron Range congressmen introduced a bill in February 1961, the Minnesota Legislature passed it unanimously, and Governor Elmer L. Andersen signed it into law in April. of the park were already Minnesota public land. Private owners of the remaining acreage willingly sold to the state, and development began immediately. The campground, picnic area, and roads were in place by October 1961. Conrad L. Wirth, director of the National Park Service, gave the keynote address at Bear Head Lake State Park's dedication on June 26, 1962. Some property at the south end of Bear Head Lake was added in 1963. The Parks & Trails Council of Minnesota secured an additional in the early 2000s. \\"America's Favorite Park\\" In September 2010 Bear Head Lake State Park was the unlikely winner of the inaugural \\"America Is Your Park\\" internet poll. More than 5.7 million votes were tallied in the contest sponsored by the Coca- Cola Company's Live Positively charitable campaign and the National Park Foundation. Users were invited to vote as many times as they liked for any U.S. national, state, or municipal park to receive $100,000 and the title \\"America's Favorite Park.\\" Over 1.6 million votes were cast for Bear Head Lake, easily besting runner-up Great Smoky Mountains National Park by more than half a million. This was an impressive showing for a park with an annual attendance of about 100,000, not even ranking in Minnesota's top ten state parks for overnight visits. The win was credited in part to support from online fans of Lily and Hope, mother and cub black bears featured in a popular webcam by biologist Lynn Rogers of the North American Bear Center in Ely. Some of his research bears dwell in the park. Tipped off by Rogers, many of the bears' 200,000 Facebook and webcam fans promoted the contest as a viral phenomenon. Internet activism by Lily followers had won other online grants and contests benefiting the Ely community. An oversize check was presented to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in a ceremony at their headquarters in St. Paul. DNR officials said the money would go toward a trail center at Bear Head Lake State Park. This long-desired amenity will provide an all-season gathering place for visitors. Lily fans made another strong showing for the second \\"America's Favorite Park\\" poll, boosting nearby Soudan Underground Mine State Park to a second-place win and $50,000 prize in 2011. Recreation Rental watercraft near the Bear Head Lake boat ramp Bear Head Lake State Park mixes the North Woods scenery of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) with modern access and amenities. As such it has been described as an \\"entry-level taste\\" of the BWCAW. It is especially known for its fishing and canoeing opportunities. Bear Head and Eagles Nest Lake No. 3 have boat ramps. Bear Head is also developed with a sandy swimming beach, canoe launch, and handicapped-accessible fishing pier. Both large lakes support northern pike, walleye, black basses, black crappie, and panfish, while Norberg and Cub Lakes are stocked with brook trout. The park's various overnight options are all convenient to a lakeshore. The drive-in campground has 73 sites‚Äî45 of which have electrical hookups‚Äîand five camper cabins, plus showers, flush toilets, and a dump station. A rental guesthouse offers a full kitchen and heating/air conditioning for up to 10. A secluded group camp accommodates up to 50 tenters. Scattered elsewhere in the park are six backcountry campsites catering to backpackers or boaters. The park's modest trail system totals . Much of Bear Head Lake State Park is inaccessible by trail. In winter are groomed for cross-country skiing, while the rest of the park is open to snowshoeing. The Taconite State Trail and a spur to the picnic area provide a snowmobile route through the park.

He is committed to the process of co-operative inquiry, in whatever field it is applied, as a basic form of relational and participative spiritual practice. Heron was the founder and director of the Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey from 1970 to 1977, the first university-based centre for humanistic and transpersonal psychology and education in Europe. He was Assistant Director of the British Postgraduate Medical Federation at the University of London from 1977 to 1985, in charge of an innovative programme of personal and professional development for hospital doctors and GPs, including a co-operative inquiry into whole-person medicine, out of which the British Holistic Medical Association was formed. He was the director of the International Centre for Co-operative Inquiry at Volterra, Tuscany, Italy, from 1990 to 2000, where radical forms of spiritual inquiry were developed. He is co-director of the South Pacific Centre for Human Inquiry at Auckland, New Zealand from 2000 to the present, focussing on long- term co-operative inquiries into charismatic and relational spiritual practices. Heron is a group facilitator and trainer in the fields of co- counselling (in 1974 he was one of the founders of Co-Counselling International after a split from the Re-evaluation Counseling of Harvey Jackins), co-operative inquiry and new paradigm research, educational and staff development, group facilitation and interactive skills, management development, personal and transpersonal development, professional development in medicine, psychotherapy and the helping professions. He is also a researcher and author. Heron was a group facilitator on UK TV programmes on the following topics: medical stress (ITV, 1981), racism (BBC2, 1985), AIDS (Channel 4, 1987), Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses (BBC2, 1990), divorce (BBC2, 1991), parents and teenagers (BBC1, 1994).

History The Umana Yana is situated on Main Street next to the Le Meridien Pegasus Hotel, it is now a permanent and much admired part of Georgetown's scenery, and is in constant use as an exhibition and conference centre. The structure is high and is made from thatched allibanna and manicole palm leaves, and wallaba posts lashed together with mukru, turu and nibbi vines. No nails were used. It was erected by a team of about sixty Wai-Wai Amerindians, one of the nine indigenous tribes of Guyana. Fashioned like the Wai-Wai benabs or shelters which are found deep in Guyana's interior, it occupies an area of 460 square metres, making it the largest structure of its kind in Guyana.

History The National Institute for Higher Education (NIHE) was founded in Limerick in 1972. The 113 students who started in NIHEL, that year, founded the Students' Union, which was later to become the University of Limerick Students' Union. In its early years, all officers served in a voluntary capacity. The first officers elected included John Redington (President), John Kerr (Vice-president), Fionnuala Lyddy (Secretary) and Eric Duhan (Treasurer). Pat Carroll was elected in 1975 as the first full-time President. The National College of Physical Eductation (NCPE), subsequently Thomond College of Education, had a separate students' union also founded in 1972 until its amalgamation with the University of Limerick. Its first President was Brendan Lillis. From its inception in 1972, the union had been involved with the Union of Students in Ireland (USI). ULSU withdrew in 1991 from USI after it decided that the national union was no longer doing what it should be doing for ordinary students on the ground. ULSU has never reaffiliated to USI, although an inquorate referendum held in 2001 on the issue indicated some support among students for such a move. The votes cast in this referendum were counted and showed that just under 55 percent of students who voted were in favour of rejoining. 66 percent in favour would have been needed to pass the referendum. The referendum did not have enough votes (only 700, changed from 20 percent to 15 percent in 2006 to be deemed valid).  Re-brand  In July 2018 the union underwent a re-brand to \\"UL Student Life\\". This re-brand was spearheaded by the 2017/2018 executive with a view to increase student participation with the organisation. However this re-brand has faced criticism from both past and present students and has raised questions about the democratic process within the union. Under the union's constitution name changes must be approved by a college-wide referendum or an AGM where quorum is 100 students. 25 members were in attendance when the name change was proposed with only 3 voting against the proposed re-brand. The re-brand has also attracted controversy due to the high costs involved. A former Vice-President of the Postgraduate Students‚Äô Union Declan Mills cited costs of between ‚Ç¨20,000 and ‚Ç¨25,000 for development of the brand by an outside company alone. Additional costs associated with the re-brand are not yet known. An Focal and other publications The Students' Union produces a newspaper, An Focal. The production of An Focal was formerly the responsibility of the Vice- President/Communications Officer. Following the abolition of this office in 2012, a full-time student was appointed Editor. The Editor is assisted by an editorial team of student volunteers as well as student contributors. The paper's print schedule was up until December 2017 fortnightly before the union decided to change it to monthly without consulting the editor of An Focal. A spokesperson for the union cited that the paper had \\"deteriorated considerably in terms of layout, spelling, grammar, use of colour and overall design\\". Organisation and services The Union also provides other services to students - graphics, Nitelink bus service, education advice, welfare advice, second-hand bookshop, and phone repairs. The Students' Union in UL has two main differences from some other Students' Unions: # There is a separate Postgraduate Students Union - to represent all Postgraduate Students on postgraduate issues only. The Postgraduate students elect a full-time sabbatical President and a part-time Vice-President/Treasurer for the PSU. # It runs its own clubs and societies through the UL Wolves brand and administrative superstructure, with its own Executive and two elected reps to the Union Executive - these are administered through the union by and for the students. As of 2018, ULSU supports 37 active clubs and 45 societies.https://ulsu.ie/clubssocs ReferencesExternal links * Official Web Site: University of Limerick Students' Union * Clubs and Societies in the University of Limerick Category:Students' unions in Ireland Category:University of Limerick ","title":"University of Limerick Students' Union"},{"id":"3565161","text":"Dodgeball was a location-based social networking software provider for mobile devices.

It is the only Jewish school on Chicago's South Side and attracts a wide range of students from across the Chicago metropolitan area. History The school came into existence in 1972 through the merger of an Orthodox-affiliated school, Akiba South Side Jewish Day School (founded in 1949), and a school affiliated with the Conservative movement, Solomon Schechter South Side School (founded in 1965). Since the merger, Akiba- Schechter has been run under the auspices of both the Associated Talmud Torahs (Orthodox), the Board of Jewish Education (Community), and now the Jewish United Fund of Chicago. Since 2017, Akiba-Schechter has been under the leadership of Dr. Eliezer Jones, as its seventh Head of School. Pre-school The Pre-school was founded in 1982, and has since become a highly renowned pre-school and continues to grow. Barbara Simon, the pre-school's first director, continues to teach, although the pre-school has been under the leadership of Carla Goldberg, a Kohl McCormick Early Childhood Teaching Award winner in 2000. Akiba-Schechter's Pre-School and Kindergarten is a NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children) accredited program. The Preschool is most well known for its play-based and Reggio Emilia-inspired curriculum. It, unlike the Grade School, is open to all faiths, and the diversity of its population reflects this. Recent changes The west-facing exterior of Akiba-Schechter's grade-school building. In 1998, the School purchased from Congregation Rodfei Zedek two buildings in which it had operated since 1972 - Hoffman House (home to the elementary school) and a 1965 building, used for the pre-school. In 2005, Hoffman House was replaced by a new elementary school building designed by architect John Ronan. Ronan has received numerous prestigious awards for the new building, including an award from the Chicago Architecture Foundation. During the summer of 2007, a major renovation of the original 1965 building was undertaken, including upgrades of the heating, cooling, plumbing, and electrical systems, and installation of modern exterior windows. The second phase of the renovation is planned and will include interior finishes, a renovated administrative office suite that features a new Teacher Resource Library and the renovation and expansion of the Pre-School playground.

It was awarded the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature in 2010. The film is a call to action to halt mass dolphin kills and captures, change Japanese fishing practices, and to inform and educate the public about captivity and the risks, and increasing hazard, of mercury poisoning from dolphin meat. The film is told from an ocean conservationist's point of view.OPSociety.org , Oceanic Preservation Society ‚Äì Facts The film highlights the fact that the number of dolphins killed in the Taiji dolphin drive hunt is several times greater than the number of whales killed in the Antarctic, and asserts that 23,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in Japan every year by the country's whaling industry. The migrating dolphins are herded into a cove where they are netted off. The young and pretty are then captured to be sold to the oceanariums and dolphinariums around the world; the rest are brutally slaughtered. The film argues that dolphin hunting as practiced in Japan is unnecessary and cruel. Since the film's release, The Cove has drawn controversy over neutrality, secret filming, and its portrayal of the Japanese people. The film was directed by former National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos.Catsoulis, Jeannette. The Cove (2008) From Flipper's Trainer to Dolphin Defender The New York Times. July 31, 2009. Portions were filmed secretly in 2007 using underwater microphones and high-definition cameras disguised as rocks.\\"Dolphin slaughter film a hit at Sundance\\" The Japan Times. (January 27, 2009). Retrieved on January 27, 2009.Jurgensen, John. A Dolphin Horror Film The Wall Street Journal. July 31, 2009. The documentary won the U.S. Audience Award at the 25th annual Sundance Film Festival in January 2009. It was selected out of the 879 submissions in the category.The Cove Sundance Festival 2009 Synopsis The film follows former dolphin trainer and activist Ric O'Barry's quest to document the dolphin hunting operations in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of \\"Flipper\\" in the hit television series of the same name. The show, very popular, fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. After one of the dolphins, in O'Barry's opinion, committed a form of suicide in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, O'Barry came to see the dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as a curse, not a blessing. Days later, he was arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin. Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world. After meeting with O'Barry, Psihoyos and his crew travel to Taiji, Japan, a town that appears to be devoted to dolphins and whales. In a nearby, isolated cove, however, surrounded by wire fences and \\"Keep Out\\" signs, an activity takes place that the townspeople attempt to hide from the public. In the cove, a group of Taiji fishermen engage in dolphin drive hunting. The film states that the dolphin hunt is, in large part, motivated by the tremendous revenue generated for the town by selling some of the captured dolphins, female bottlenose dolphins, to aquariums and marine parks and killing the majority of the rest. The dolphins that are not sold into captivity are then slaughtered in the cove and the meat is sold in supermarkets. According to the evidence presented in the film, the local Japanese government officials are involved in the hiding of the hunting, and the Japanese public is not fully aware of the hunt and the marketing of dolphin meat. The film states that the dolphin meat contains dangerously high levels of mercury and interviews two local politicians, Taiji city councilors who have, for that reason, advocated the removal of dolphin meat from local school lunches. Attempts to view or film the dolphin killing in the cove are physically blocked by local police and the Japanese local government who treat the visitors with open intimidation, derision, and anger. Foreigners who come to Taiji, including The Cove's film crew, are shadowed and questioned by local police. In response, together with the Oceanic Preservation Society, Psihoyos, O'Barry, and the crew utilize special tactics and technology to covertly film what is taking place in the cove. The film also reports on Japan's alleged \\"buying\\" of votes of poor nations in the International Whaling Commission. The film indicates that while Dominica has withdrawn from the IWC, Japan has recruited the following nations to its whaling agenda: Cambodia, Ecuador, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Kiribati, Laos, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. At the end of the film, O'Barry shows footage of the Taiji dolphin slaughter to a Japanese official, after the official repeatedly denies the incident; he is unmoved by the footage and asks O'Barry where he obtained it. The film then cuts to a scene showing an annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission. O'Barry marches into a meeting of the Commission strapping a TV showing the footage on his chest (while the Japanese delegates are talking about how they have improved whaling tactics). O'Barry walks around the crowded meeting room displaying the images until he is escorted from the room.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars (out of four), calling the film \\"a certain Oscar nominee\\".The Cove RogerEbert.com Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times called the film \\"an exceptionally well-made documentary that unfolds like a spy thriller\\", going on to describe it as \\"one of the most audacious and perilous operations in the history of the conservation movement\\".

Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 95% of critics had given the film positive reviews, based upon 133 total reviews, and an average rating of 8.00/10, summarizing the consensus as \\"Though decidedly one-sided, The Cove is an impeccably crafted, suspenseful expos√© of the covert slaughter of dolphins in Japan.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 84, based on 26 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

David Cox of The Guardian Film Blog called it a \\"piece of evangelism\\", and asked rhetorically: \\"Westerners... kill and eat cows. Easterners eat dolphins. What's the difference?\\". According to Michelle Orange of Movie Line \\"How much of this (The Cove) should we believe? As a piece of propaganda, The Cove is brilliant; as a story of ingenuity and triumph over what seems like senseless brutality, it is exceptionally well-told; but as a conscientious overview of a complex and deeply fraught, layered issue, it invokes the same phrase as even the most well-intentioned, impassioned activist docs: Buyer beware.\\" Reactions in Taiji, Japan The whale and dolphin hunting season in Japan usually begins on September 1 each year; in 2009, the hunting began on September 9. Although activists tend to believe that it was because of the publicity generated by the film, it has been reported that the delay was due to the weather and rough seas. According to campaigners, out of the 100 dolphins captured on September 9, some were taken to be sold to marine museums and the rest were released, while 50 pilot whales were killed and sold for meat on the same day. While campaigners claim that it has become apparent that The Cove is having an impact on the way in which Japanese fisherman normally conduct the dolphin hunt,Conservationists say 70 dolphins in Japan released. Associated Press. September 15, 2009. on March 23, 2010, the Japanese government stated \\"The dolphin hunting is a part of traditional fishery of this country and it has been lawfully carried out.\\" Upon the film winning the Oscar, the town mayor of Taiji and the chief of Taiji Fishery Union said \\"The hunt is performed legally and properly with the permission of Wakayama Prefecture [local government].\\" Taiji assemblyman Hisato Ryono, one of the two local legislators who broke ranks and publicly called for removal of dolphin meat from school lunches, said he was lied to by the documentary's producers about what the film would contain.Alabaster, Jay, (Associated Press), \\"Cove Oscar Won't End Taiji Dolphin Kill\\", Japan Times, March 20, 2010, p. 2. Since the release of the film, a much larger number of activists, mainly non-Japanese, have visited Taiji to protest or film the dolphin hunts. The Taiji fishermen responded by constructing an elaborate structure of tarps to better conceal the drive- hunting activities in and around the cove. Reactions in Seaworld SeaWorld spokesperson Fred Jacobs has responded by saying that, \\"We think we're being unfairly criticized for something we're opposed to.\\" He adds that, \\"SeaWorld opposes the dolphin hunts documented in The Cove. We do not purchase any animals from these hunts. More than 80 percent of the marine mammals in our care were born in our parks. We haven't collected a dolphin from the wild in decades.\\" However, Jacobs does not condemn those who purchase from the Taiji dolphin hunt. O'Barry has thus been criticized for emphasizing that dolphinariums are a large contributing factor to the economic success of the dolphin slaughter in Taiji and for encouraging boycotts of dolphin shows to protest the dolphin slaughter. The scene in The Cove that displays a map consisting of arrows emanating from Taiji and pointing to countries with dolphinariums has been said to be misleading since the majority of those countries do not currently have dolphins of Japanese origin. However, there is no proof to prove, or disprove these claims. In the United States it is currently illegal to import dolphins obtained from a drive, including the drive hunt at Taiji, as it is considered an inhumane method. Since 1993 there have been no permits issued to facilities in the United States to import dolphins acquired through drive hunt methods. Marilee Menard, the executive director of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, has also stated that she believes that the filmmakers are \\"misrepresenting that the majority of zoos and aquariums with dolphins around the world are taking these animals.\\" Reactions in Western Australia In August 2009, after the screening of the film in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane film festivals, the councillors of the Shire of Broome, Western Australia, voted unanimously to suspend its sister city relationship with the Japanese whaling port town of Taiji, as long as the latter continues its dolphin slaughter. The decision was reversed in October 2009. Release in Japan The film was initially screened only at two small venues in Japan: at the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Tokyo in September 2009, and at the Tokyo International Film Festival in October 2009 where it received mixed reviews. A Japanese film distributor, Medallion Media/Unplugged, subsequently acquired the rights to screen the film in Japan. The company hoped to begin a run of the movie in Japanese cinemas in June 2010. Medallion prepared the documentary for presentation in Japan by pixelating the faces of Taiji residents and fishermen depicted in the film. (In Japanese: „Ç¢„Ç´„Éá„Éü„ÉºË≥ûÔºö„Äå„Ç∂„Éª„Ç≥„Éº„É¥„ÄçÂèóË≥û„Å´ÂíåÊ≠åÂ±±ÂèçÁô∫ .) Nationalist protesters vowed to block the release of the film in Japan and dozens equipped with loudspeakers have demonstrated outside of the distributor's office in central Tokyo. As of June 2010, the controversy over the film and the film's subject had received little press attention in Japanese-language media in Japan. Boyd Harnell of the Japan Times stated on May 23, 2010, that Japanese news editors had told him that the topic was \\"too sensitive\\" for them to cover. In April 2010, Colonel Frank Eppich, the United States Air Force commander of Yokota Air Base, located near Tokyo, banned screenings of the film at the base theater. A base spokesman said that The Cove was banned because using a base venue to display the film could be seen as an endorsement of the film. The spokesman added, \\"We have a lot of issues with Japan ... and anything done on an American base would be seen as an approval of that event.\\" In response, Louie Psihoyos said that he would give away 100 DVD copies of the film free to Yokota base personnel. A screening scheduled for June 26, 2010 at Theater N in Shibuya was canceled after staff were harassed by protesters. Unplugged stated that it was in negotiations with other theaters to screen the film. Another theater in Tokyo and one in Osaka subsequently declined to screen the film. In response, a group of 61 media figures, including journalist Akihiro ≈åtani and filmmaker Yoichi Sai, released a statement expressing concern over the threat to freedom of speech by the intimidation of right-wing groups. The Directors Guild of Japan also asked theaters not to stop showing the film, arguing that \\"such moves would limit opportunities to express thoughts and beliefs, which are the core of democracy.\\" On June 9, 2010, Tsukuru Publishing Co. sponsored a screening of the film and panel discussion at Nakano Zero theater in Nakano, Tokyo. The panelists included five who had signed the statement above. Afterwards, panel member Kunio Suzuki, former head of Issuikai, an Uyoku dantai (rightist) group, condemned the right-winger's threats against theaters and urged that the film be shown. \\"Not letting people watch the movie is anti- Japanese\\", said Suzuki. In response to the cancellation of screenings of the film in Japan, Japanese video sharing site Nico Nico Douga screened the film free on June 18, 2010. The same week, Ric O'Barry was invited to speak at several universities in Japan about the film. O'Barry stated that he was planning on bringing several Hollywood stars to Taiji in September 2010 in an attempt to halt that year's hunt. On July 3, 2010, six theaters in Sendai, Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, and Hachinohe began screening the film. Right- wing nationalists protested outside four of the theaters, but close police supervision prevented any disruption to the viewing schedules and ensured free access for viewers to the theaters. The two in Tokyo and Yokohama were successful in obtaining prior court injunctions prohibiting protests outside their venues. A local Taiji activist group, called People Concerned for the Ocean, announced that they would distribute DVDs of the film, dubbed in Japanese, to all 3,500 residents of Taiji. The DVDs were to be distributed to the residents on March 5‚Äì6, 2011. Controversy=Portrayal There has been some controversy over the depiction of some of the Japanese people in the film. Hirotaka Akamatsu, Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, said \\"it is regrettable that this movie is made as a message that brutal Japanese are killing cute dolphins\\". However, director Louie Psihoyos spoke of his sympathy for the Japanese people, many of whom are unaware of the situation at the cove, saying \\"To me, it's a love letter. I'm giving you the information your government won't give you.\\" Filming technique issues Close-up Gendai, an investigative journalism program on NHK, reported questions raised regarding the objectivity of the filming. One scene in the film was presented as having been manufactured for the camera. The segment then entered into a discussion with a commentator on whether the movie should properly be called a documentary. Chiefly the points were raised by the Taiji fishermen themselves. The local fishermen complained that the film one-sidedly depicted their angry reactions at being chased by cameras, and did not adequately explain the backdrop that they had been harassed by activists such as the Sea Shepherd and individuals attracted by the bounty offered by this organization for capturing damaging footages. The NHK (on a different program) concluded that the activists did so in order to capture angry and wild expressions by the local fishermen in the film and in photos. Louie Psihoyos, the documentary's director was interviewed by Close-up Gendai, but no response was broadcast regarding the allegedly scripted and acted scene. Elsewhere, Psihoyos has stated categorically that none of the scenes in the film were staged.; reprinted in Pioneer Press, August 28, 2010 Alleged inaccuracies Tetsuya End≈ç, an associate professor of the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido has complained that the film has approached him under false pretenses. In one scene, he is actually holding a sample of dolphin liver (containing an anomalously high 2000 ppm level of mercury), but the film represented it as dolphin meat bought in Taiji. In reality, the town's fishermen's union banned sales of the liver in 2003 at the professor's prompting. Endo sought to have his scenes removed, but initial screenings went ahead without, and he sued the Japanese rights-holder, Medallion Media, and the distributor, Unplugged, for ¬•11 million for damages to his reputation. The litigation opened in Tokyo District Court on December 1, 2010.Kyodo News, \\"Professor in 'Cove' sues film firms over arbitrary editing\\", Japan Times, December 2, 2010. Towards the end of the film, the assistant chief of the whaling division at Japan's Fisheries Agency Hideki Moronuki is erroneously captioned as having subsequently been \\"fired\\". The error was reported by the investigative news program Close-up Gendai, and Psihoyos when confronted conceded he might have misunderstood.Sea Change Radio (Interview with Psihoyos) Opposing documentary In 2015, filmmaker released a documentary titled Behind The Cove which presented the side of the Taiji fishermen.

Molecular characteristics  uPAR consists of three different domains of the three-finger protein domain family, which also includes domains found in lymphocyte antigen 6 and in snake venom toxins of the three-finger toxin family, such as alpha-neurotoxins. All three three-finger domains are necessary for high affinity binding of the primary ligand, urokinase. It has been possible to express uPAR recombinantly in CHO-cells and S2 cells from Drosophila melanogaster. 4 out of 5 of the possible glycosylation sites are used in vivo giving the protein a molecular weight of 50-60 kDA. Recently the structure of uPAR was solved by X-ray crystallography in complex with a peptide antagonist and with its native ligand, urokinase. Besides the primary ligand urokinase, uPAR interacts with several other proteins, among others: vitronectin, the uPAR associated protein (uPARAP) and the integrin family of membrane proteins.  Physiological significance  uPAR is a part of the plasminogen activation system, which in the healthy body is involved in tissue reorganization events such as mammary gland involution and wound healing. In order to be able to reorganize tissue, the old tissue must be able to be degraded. An important mechanism in this degradation is the proteolysis cascade initiated by the plasminogen activation system. uPAR binds urokinase and thus restricts plasminogen activation to the immediate vicinity of the cell membrane. Thus uPAR seems to be an important player in the regulation of this process. When uPA is bound to the receptor, there is cleavage between the GPI-anchor and the uPAR, releasing suPAR.  Clinical significance  Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been found to be a biomarker of inflammation. Elevated suPAR is seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver failure, heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Smokers have significantly higher suPAR compared to non-smokers. Urokinase receptors have been found to be highly expressed on senescent cells, leading researchers to use chimeric antigen receptor T cells to eliminate senescent cells in mice. The components of the plasminogen activation system have been found to be highly expressed in many malignant tumors, indicating that tumors are able to hijack the system, and use it in metastasis. Thus inhibitors of the various components of the plasminogen activation system have been sought as possible anticancer drugs. uPAR has been involved in various other non-proteolytical processes related to cancer, such as cell migration, cell cycle regulation, and cell adhesion.  Interactions  Urokinase receptor has been shown to interact with LRP1.

The model was proposed by James G. Oldroyd. The concept is named after James Clerk Maxwell. The model can be written as: : \\\\mathbf{T} + \\\\lambda \\\\stackrel{ abla}{\\\\mathbf{T}} = 2\\\\eta_0 \\\\mathbf {D} where: * \\\\mathbf{T} is the stress tensor; * \\\\lambda is the relaxation time; * \\\\stackrel{ abla}{\\\\mathbf{T}} is the upper-convected time derivative of stress tensor: : \\\\stackrel{ abla}{\\\\mathbf{T}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\mathbf{T} + \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf{T} - ( abla \\\\mathbf{v})^T \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{T} - \\\\mathbf{T} \\\\cdot ( abla \\\\mathbf{v}) *\\\\mathbf{v} is the fluid velocity *\\\\eta_0 is material viscosity at steady simple shear; *\\\\mathbf {D} is the deformation rate tensor. Case of the steady shear For this case only two components of the shear stress became non-zero: :T_{12}=\\\\eta_0 \\\\dot \\\\gamma \\\\, and :T_{11}=2 \\\\eta_0 \\\\lambda {\\\\dot \\\\gamma}^2 \\\\, where \\\\dot \\\\gamma is the shear rate. Thus, the upper-convected Maxwell model predicts for the simple shear that shear stress to be proportional to the shear rate and the first difference of normal stresses (T_{11}-T_{22}) is proportional to the square of the shear rate, the second difference of normal stresses (T_{22}-T_{33}) is always zero. In other words, UCM predicts appearance of the first difference of normal stresses but does not predict non-Newtonian behavior of the shear viscosity nor the second difference of the normal stresses. Usually quadratic behavior of the first difference of normal stresses and no second difference of the normal stresses is a realistic behavior of polymer melts at moderated shear rates, but constant viscosity is unrealistic and limits usability of the model. Case of start-up of steady shear For this case only two components of the shear stress became non-zero: :T_{12}=\\\\eta_0 \\\\dot \\\\gamma \\\\left(1-\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac t \\\\lambda\\\\right)\\\\right) and :T_{11}=2 \\\\eta_0 \\\\lambda {\\\\dot \\\\gamma}^2 \\\\left(1 -\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac t \\\\lambda\\\\right)\\\\left(1+\\\\frac t \\\\lambda \\\\right)\\\\right) The equations above describe stresses gradually risen from zero the steady-state values. The equation is only applicable, when the velocity profile in the shear flow is fully developed. Then the shear rate is constant over the channel height. If the start-up form a zero velocity distribution has to be calculated, the full set of PDEs has to be solved. Case of the steady state uniaxial extension or uniaxial compression For this case UCM predicts the normal stresses \\\\sigma=T_{11}-T_{22}=T_{11}-T_{33} calculated by the following equation: : \\\\sigma=\\\\frac {2 \\\\eta_0 \\\\dot \\\\epsilon} {1-2\\\\lambda \\\\dot \\\\epsilon} + \\\\frac {\\\\eta_0 \\\\dot \\\\epsilon} {1+ \\\\lambda \\\\dot \\\\epsilon} where \\\\dot \\\\epsilon is the elongation rate. The equation predicts the elongation viscosity approaching 3 \\\\eta_0 (the same as for the Newtonian fluids) for the case of low elongation rate ( \\\\dot \\\\epsilon \\\\ll \\\\frac 1 \\\\lambda) with fast deformation thickening with the steady state viscosity approaching infinity at some elongational rate (\\\\dot \\\\epsilon_\\\\infty = \\\\frac 1 {2 \\\\lambda}) and at some compression rate (\\\\dot \\\\epsilon_{-\\\\infty} = -\\\\frac 1 {\\\\lambda}). This behavior seems to be realistic. Case of small deformation For the case of small deformation the nonlinearities introduced by the upper- convected derivative disappear and the model became an ordinary model of Maxwell material.

This is Gu's first film as director after a lengthy career as a cinematographer for some of China's top directors. The film premiered simultaneously in both China and in competition at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival, going on to receive Berlin's Jury Grand Prix Silver Bear. Its original runtime was over four hours, but was reduced to 144 minutes for its theatrical release. Synopsis The story is set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in a small town in Mainland China. A middle-aged couple has three children. The eldest son is obese and mentally challenged, a social outcast, and is constantly teased by others. The second child, the daughter, is energetic and independent and isn't afraid of doing anything to pursue her dreams or to survive. The youngest child is an introverted, quiet boy who is ashamed of his older brother and tries to break away from his family's misery. The story is broken into three sections, with each focusing on one of the siblings. The story begins with the daughter, Weihong. The mother arranges for her to start work at a nursery but a few days later she drops a child and loses her job. After watching army officers parachuting from a plane, she wonders to the field where they land. She develops a crush on one of the male officers and decides to enlist at her school. In order to get his attention, she steals her mother's money to buy him gifts but ultimately does not give it to him after seeing him with her other classmates. She does not enroll into the military and becomes depressed after seeing other enlisted men and women. In order to recreate her dreams, she knits a makeshift parachute and attaches it to her bike, which she rides down the street before being stopped by her mother. Her action draws the interest of Guozi, a boisterous factory worker. After some time, Wei Hong is working at a factory washing pharmaceutical bottles and sees Guozi with her parachute attached to his bike. They arrange for a meeting in the woods and Guozi suggestively asks for something in return for the parachute but backs out before anything happens. Weihong continues to wonder around searching for purpose and meets an old man playing the accordion, whom she develops a father-daughter relationship with. However, the old man's children suspect her of taking advantage of him and physically assault her while she is at the factory. Through her parent's connections, she is introduced to a district leader's driver and they marry, on the condition that she is given a new job. Before she leaves with her husband, she gives her older brother a watch and bids farewell to her family. The story then shifts back to the family eating at a table and this time follows the events of the older brother, Weiguo. He is often bullied because of his disability and has to change jobs. However, his parents dote on him, to the chagrin of the younger brother who has to look after him. At a bathhouse, someone sets off a firecracker in Weiguo's cigarette and he has a seizure. Weihong asks for Guozi to get revenge by beating up the bully. One day, when Weiguo shows up at school to bring Weiqiang an umbrella, he is accused of being a peeping tom after he stands outside the girls' bathroom. He is beaten by a group of boys and Weiqiang is also publicly ridiculed. Out of contempt, Weiqiang denounces Weiguo in front of everyone and stabs his leg with an umbrella. Weiqiang is continually ostracized by his classmates because of what happened except for one girl who helps him once out of pity. When the girl later turns her back on Weiqiang, he decides to get rid of Weiguo by putting rat poison in his drink at night. However, Weihong finds out and stops him. The next morning, the mother reveals that she knows about what happened last night by making a duck drink the rat poison in front of the family and making them watch it convulse and die. Weiqiang realizes his mistake, and tries to make it up to Weiguo by buying him a meal and baby duck. After previous attempts to make a match for Weiguo, the parents arrange for him to meet a girl with a physical disability. They set up a small food stall, which becomes successful. Finally, the story returns to the family eating at the table and Weiqiang becomes the focus. He is infatuated with the girl who helped him earlier on. After his father discovers his drawings of naked women in his textbook, he is almost kicked out. Weiqiang leaves on his own accord and goes missing for days. Guozi spots Weiqiang one day and, together with Weihong, they follow him to an elderly care home and find him working there. Weiqiang then gets on a train the next day and leaves the town. When Weihong is asked where his brother has gone, she imagines he has accomplished her dream of becoming an army officer. A few years later, the parents are shown eating at the table. Weihong moves back in after she has separated from her husband. Weiguo and his wife are still continuing their business, which has attracted many customers. Weiqiang also returns one day with a wife and son. He has lost a finger but he does not explain this to his family. He does not work and instead relies on his wife as a stage singer to support him. Weihong spots the army officer she used to idolise in the streets but finds that he has become a regular person wearing simple clothing. In the ending scene, Weihong is shown to have remarried and all three siblings visit a peacock enclosure with their families, making remarks about why the peacock won't open its feathers. Only when they have left does the peacock opens its feathers.

Early career Born in Sydney, Whitty had only played junior cricket before he was noticed by Test batsman Victor Trumper, who recommended him for coaching and gave him the opportunity to bowl to the New South Wales state team. In 1907, at the age of 21, Whitty made his first-class debut for New South Wales against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground, taking 3 wickets. This was the only first-class match Whitty played for his home state, as he was recruited to Adelaide by Clem Hill to play for South Australia in 1908. Whitty played 5 first-class games in the 1908‚Äì09 Australian season, including one match for a \\"Rest of Australia\\" team against the Australian XI, where he took 3 wickets. Over the entire season, Whitty took 11 wickets with an average of 49.00, which was enough to earn him selection into the Australian team to tour England in 1909. Test career Whitty played in the first Test of the series, recording figures of 0/43 and 0/18 as England posted a dominant 10 wicket victory. Whitty was replaced for the second Test, which Australia won, along with the third, in retaining the Ashes. Despite his struggle to hold on to his Test position, Whitty took 77 wickets on the tour, at the impressive average of 20.42. On his return home to Australia, he continued to play for South Australia in 1909‚Äì10, helping them to win the Sheffield Shield for the second time in their history. In the final match of the season against New South Wales, Whitty took 5/43 as his former team was dismissed for just 92 in their first innings. Whitty's six-foot tall frame allowed him to swing the new ball considerably, and he also bowled reasonably quick left-arm orthodox deliveries with the older ball. He was seen as the ideal partner for fast bowler Tibby Cotter, and the pair opened the bowling at home against South Africa in 1910‚Äì11. This series has been described as Whitty's \\"greatest Test success\\", as he played all 5 Tests to take 37 wickets at the outstanding average of 17.08. Whitty took 8 wickets in the first Test, followed by 3 in the first innings of the second Test in Melbourne. In the second innings, with South Africa requiring 170 runs for victory, Whitty produced one of the \\"most sensational\\" bowling spells by an Australian in the period, taking 6/17 in 16 overs as South Africa were bowled out for 80. Whitty's good form continued throughout the series, including a further 8 wickets in the third Test, and 5/79 for South Australia against the tourists. In the fourth Test, Whitty produced his best Test performance with the bat, making 39 not out in an 82-run partnership with Vernon Ransford, which remained a record for the 10th wicket in Tests between the two nations until it was broken by Mike Hussey and Glenn McGrath in 2005‚Äì06. Whitty was again selected in the Australian team for the first two Tests against England during their 1911‚Äì12 tour of Australia, but managed just 3 wickets at 61.67, and was left out of the team for the remainder of the five-Test series. Despite this performance, and partly due to a \\"boardroom brawl\\" which saw Australia leave behind many of its best players, Whitty was selected to tour England for the 1912 Triangular Test series, which also featured South Africa. The squad has often been described as \\"one of the worst teams Australia ever sent overseas\\", 10 of the 15 players having never travelled to England before. Whitty took 25 wickets in the 6 Test matches, including 7 wickets against England at The Oval, and 5/55 against South Africa at Old Trafford. He finished the tour with 109 wickets at 18.08, second only in averages to Charles Macartney. South Australia took their 3rd Sheffield Shield in 1912‚Äì13, with Whitty taking figures of 5/65 in Melbourne and 5/92 (and a run out) in Sydney. He was selected in the Australian team scheduled to tour South Africa in 1914‚Äì15, but the tour was cancelled due to World War I, effectively ending Whitty's Test career. During his Test career, Whitty also toured New Zealand, the United States, Canada and Bermuda. In the United States, at the end of the 1912 England tour, Australia incredibly lost to a Philadelphian team, with Whitty being one of only two players to score over 20 in Australia's first innings, before being bowled on the fourth delivery of the final over, with Australia needing 3 runs for victory. After World War I Whitty continued to play domestically after the War ended, and was still good enough to regularly take 5-wicket hauls in first-class cricket up to the age of 38. Whitty played his final first-class game as New South Wales wrapped up the 1925‚Äì26 Sheffield Shield. A feature of Whitty's first-class career was his remarkable success bowling to his hero Trumper, with Whitty dismissing him seven times in ten innings ‚Äì Trumper remaining not out in the other three. At lower levels, Whitty played for East Torrens in Adelaide from 1908 to 1915, consistently taking over 50 wickets a season, and leading district bowling averages for four consecutive years from 1911. He played for Glenelg from 1920 to 1927, and continued playing in the Mount Gambier region until 1937. He was also an enthusiastic golfer, and at one stage played off scratch. From 1938 Whitty lived on his property at Tantanoola, where he died aged 87, the longest surviving of Australia's pre-WWI Test cricketers.

His original centre of power was the V√©xin. Dagobert III appointed him in opposition to Theudoald, grandson and heir of Pepin, and his grandmother Plectrude, but he was ignored by both Plectrude and Charles. In 716, Ragenfrid and Dagobert's successor, Chilperic II, fought deep into the heartland of Arnulfing power: the Maas and Ardennes. They allied with Dagobert's old enemy, Duke Radbod of Frisia, and defeated their rival Charles near Cologne, in which he had been besieging Plectrude and Theudoald. Ragenfrid went and Chilperic forced Plectrude to surrender most of the Austrasian treasury, her grandson's claim to the mayoralty, and acknowledge Chilperic as king. At this juncture, Charles set up his own Merovingian king, Clotaire IV; Dagobert's true successor, Chilperic II, being a staunch ally of Ragenfrid and the Neustrian nation. Ragenfrid and his king allied with Odo the Great, duke of Aquitaine independent since 715, but was defeated at Amel (north of St. Vith) in 716, and in March, 717, at Vincy, near Cambrai, and then in 718 at Soissons. Ragenfrid was now decisively out of power and he fled to Angers; however, he did not give up yet. When Paris and the Loire Valley were taken and Odo gave up Chilperic, who Charles finally accepted (under his thumb) in 719, Ragenfrid then gave himself up (720) and was deprived of his office, left only with lands in Anjou. In 724, the Neustrians rebelled under Ragenfrid, but they were easily defeated. However, Ragenfrid gave up his sons as hostages in turn for keeping his county. He lived on until 731.

Special exhibits  Rock & Roll Exhibit - In 2009, the Oklahoma History Center hosted \\"Another Hot Oklahoma Night: A Rock & Roll Exhibit\\", a title that comes from the lyrics of a song by Oklahoma-born musician Michael Been.Triplett, Gene. \\"Oklahoma-born rocker Michael Been dies in Belgium\\", The Oklahoman, August 20, 2010. Accessed August 20, 2010. This exhibit explored the rock and roll artists, radio stations, personalities, venues, and fans that have called Oklahoma home. Beyond the facts of each story, the exhibit showed how growing up in Oklahoma affected the music. These were displayed in an innovative style to encourage visitor participation and to ensure that the visitor would take away a new perspective on the history of rock and roll in Oklahoma. The exhibit was located in the E. L. & Thelma Gaylord Gallery on the extreme north end of the first floor. Additional exhibit components were located in the Inasmuch Foundation, Noble Foundation, and Kerr-McGee Galleries. This exhibit closed in 2011. Tierra De Mi Familia - On November 22, 2008, the Oklahoma History Center opened a museum exhibit sharing the Latino experience in Oklahoma. The interactive exhibit used interviews, artifacts, documents, photographs, film, and music to explore both the impact of Latinos on the state of Oklahoma and the impact of the state of Oklahoma on the lives of Latinos. The exhibit integrated two story lines; the historical immigration of Latinos to Oklahoma, from territorial days to present, and the cultural folkways that Oklahoma's Latino people have brought with them from Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. Oklahoma is home to cultures from all over the world, a unique blend of people that call Oklahoma their home. This exhibit provided a place to tell these immigration stories, a place to share and begin to understand and learn about the diversity of the state of Oklahoma. This exhibit closed in 2012. Oklahoma's Apollo 11 Moon Rock and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock- Rose Niang- Casey, a graduate student at the University of Phoenix, and a participant in the \\"Moon Rock Project\\", was assigned the task of hunting down the Oklahoma Apollo 11 moon rock and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock, two moon rocks the Nixon Administration gave to the people of Oklahoma. In both cases she discerned these moon rocks were properly on display at the Oklahoma History Center in Oklahoma City. She advised this is an exception to the rule, as most of these unique gifts that were given to the states and nations of the world have been poorly handled over the years.\\"Moon Rock Hunt Ends in State: A Michigan Student's Assignment Leads Her to the Oklahoma History Center, Which Possesses Two\\". Tulsa World, Deon Hampton, December 21, 2009.  Special events  Oklahoma State Level History Day Competition - Each year, the Oklahoma History Center hosts the second of a three-stage (district, state, and national) competition called National History Day. Middle- and high school students can enter documentaries, historical papers, websites, exhibit boards, or performances on a topic that the students choose that relate to each year's theme. Students' projects are judged and advance to the national competition if they place first or second in their category.

These were introduced with the Census 2000 and continued with the 2010 Census and 5 year American Community Survey data sets. This new entity was developed to overcome the difficulties in precisely defining the land area covered by each ZIP code. Defining the extent of an area is necessary in order to tabulate census data for that area. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of the United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP code service areas, but are not the same as ZIP codes. Individual USPS ZIP codes can cross state, place, county, census tract, census block group and census block boundaries, so the Census Bureau asserts that \\"there is no correlation between ZIP codes and Census Bureau geography\\".ZIP Code Information, U.S. Census Bureau Moreover, the USPS frequently realigns, merges, or splits ZIP codes to meet changing needs. These changes are usually not reflected in the annual TIGER releases. Each ZCTA is constructed by aggregating the Census 2010 blocks whose addresses use a given ZIP code. In assembling census statistical units to create ZCTAs, the Census Bureau took the ZIP code used by the majority of addresses in each census unit at the time the data was compiled. As a result, some addresses end up with a ZCTA code that is different from their ZIP code. ZCTAs are not developed for ZIP codes that comprise only a small number of addresses.United States Census Bureau ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) Several ZCTAs represent ZIPs that no longer exist due to realignment by the USPS. There are approximately 42,000 ZIP Codes and 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that only populated areas are included in the Census data, and thus ZIP Codes that only serve PO Boxes have no corresponding ZCTA.

It is based on a 1964 novel by Arthur H. Lewis. Set in late 19th century Northeastern Pennsylvania, this social drama tells the story of an undercover detective sent to a coal mining community to expose a secret society of Irish-American miners battling exploitation at the hand of the owners. Partly inspired by a true story, the film portrays the rebellious leader of the Molly Maguires and his will to achieve social justice. Background The Molly Maguires were a secret organization of Irish coal miners established in nineteenth century Pennsylvania to fight oppressive mineowners. Led by Jack Kehoe, they plant gunpowder to destroy plant shafts and equipment. Pinkerton Detective James McParland was employed to infiltrate the Mollies. Plot The film begins in a coalmine in Pennsylvania in the 1876. Coal is still dug by hand and taken out on rails in wagons pulled by ponies. Pit props are improvised with timber. Conditions are always dirty, often cramped and generally unhealthy. Miners are shown with naked flames on their hats as their only light source (this is not historically accurate as flames had been enclosed since the 1820s since invention of the Davy lamp at its variables). Men are showing planting charges. This appears to be work- related but all men leave the mine and the resultant explosion destroys the mine. Pinkerton sends James McParlan (Richard Harris) to investigate. He arrives by train in the late evening and goes to a local bar and orders a beer. He joins Dougherty and Frazier at a card table and says he is looking for work in the mine. They are suspicious and see his hands have never dug coal. They accuse him of cheating and a fight starts. Police Captain Davies (Frank Finlay) breaks up the fight and arrests McParlan. However this is just a ploy as the police know McParlan's role. Davies explains to McParlan the problem of the Molly Maguires - and that they are named after a gang in Ireland. They need an inside man to infiltrate the pit. McParlan rents a room from Mary Raines and gives his name as McKenna. He goes to the pit to ask for a job and is told to come back a 5 o clock in the morning on the following day. Back at the house he befriends Mary's father. He begins work the next day - it is back-breaking work and he is exhausted. At the end of the week he joins the long queue for pay. He is paid $9.24 however a long list is made of \\"deductions\\" including cost of explosives and cost of shovels. $9 is deducted so his pay for the week is 24 cents. Nevertheless he affords a pint of lager in the local bar (perhaps Yuengling Lagerhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuengling, as the brewery was nearby and many in PA still order this drink by simply requesting a \\"Lager\\"). Here Kehoe (Connery) observes him for the first time. In church the priest condemns \\"last night's actions\\" by the Molly Maguires - but we have not seen this action. James attends church with Mary. Kenoe confronts James in the pit the next day and asks why he is there. A fake accident is organised where Kehoe rescues James from a huge avalanche of coal. James then gives a false confession saying he is there to avoid the law as he is a forger, and he is in hiding. He also says he killed a man in Buffalo, New York over a woman. Kehoe discusses \\"McKenna\\" with his wife and then with other miners. They do suspect that he is a spy. After a violent football match with a rival pit, Dougherty gets in a fight with one of the rivals and is beaten up by the police. James is asked to take a revenge action and breaks a policeman's jaw (we do not see this). The captain chastises James but he said he had to make it look real (quoting the captain regarding his earlier attack in the bar). Kehoe and the four other ringleaders appear at the Raines house and usher old Mtr Raines away. They ask James to kneel an they make the sign of the cross. He thinks he is going to die but instead they make him a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernian. Mary chides him for joining but the next day they take a train trip to the city and go shopping. While Mary is looking at hats he has a rendezvous with the captain and gets payment for giving the names of the ringleaders. A train of coal wagons is derailed by an explosion on the track co-ordinated by the Mollys. At a meeting of the Hibernians James is asked to put a superintendent at the Shenandoah pit out of action. Kehoe and James go to Shenandoah but are ambushed by the police. The police arrest eight men back at the pit but all men have alibis. James is taken to the captain to interview, who beats him up before he returns for realism. By now James and Mary are in love. They go for a picnic and discuss morality. Frazier and his wife are murdered in their bed by police (the \\"peelers\\") in a revenge attack. At the funeral the priest shows little sympathy. Dougherty is arrested for killing the superintendent of the Shenandoah (John W. Jones), but this is a ploy to bring the real killers forward. As old Mr Raines gets the last rites the priest calls Kehoe to discuss the whole affair. At Mr Raines' wake the Mollys meet in a back room. The wake party break into the company store and steal a suit for Mr Raines to be buried in. But Kehoe then gets carried away and starts stealing more things. He is distracted when James starts destroying bottles of alcohol with a shovel. They decide to set the store on fire. Kehoe and McAndrew are caught red-handed as they break into the explosives store at the pit and find it is full of police. Only at the trial do they discover James' true identity. Mary watches in shock. Kehoe, McAndrew and Dougherty are sentenced to death. Mary explains she could cope with him as a murderer but not as a traitor. Awaiting execution, Kehoe is visited in the death cell by James. They have a quiet and civilised conversation. Kehoe sees that James seeks absolution. He suddenly loses his temper and attacks James. He is rescued by the warders. He tells his one-time ally that no punishment short of hell can redeem his treachery. Detective McParland retorts that in that case, \\"See you in hell.\\" Analysis Kehoe and McParland are working class immigrants from Ireland with essentially the same aspiration - advancement in the new society to which they have come. Production The opening sequence of The Molly Maguires runs 14 minutes and 51 seconds, through three Henry Mancini scores, before the first word of dialogue is spoken. The majority of the location filming occurred in Northeastern Pennsylvania in 1969. The town of Eckley, was so unchanged from its 1870s appearance that the only major alterations needed for filming were to remove television antennas and install underground electric wiring. A wooden coal breaker which was built as a prop and is featured extensively in the film, partially stands to this day. The movie resulted in the town‚Äôs being saved from demolition. It was afterward converted into a mining museum under the control of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. Portions of the film were also shot in Jim Thorpe. The courtroom there where the trial scene was filmed is in the Carbon County Courthouse, used for trials until 1996. Railroad scenes were filmed on the now-defunct Carrol Park & Western Railroad in Bloomsburg. The Molly Maguires soundtrack composed by Henry Mancini replaced that originally composed by Charles Strouse. Mancini's score employed Irish modal harmony, played by period instruments including the Irish Harp, Tin Whistle (pennywhistle) and Squeezebox. Both soundtracks were released by Kritzerland in 2012 on a limited edition CD, now sold-out. A big budget film for its time, with stars Connery (who had recently left the James Bond franchise) and Harris (Camelot) at career peaks, it was considered a major box-office failure. Social issue director Ritt would score later with Norma Rae (1979). This was the next-to-the-last film for legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe, who had previously worked with Ritt on Hud and Hombre.

It is located at 3000 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, in the United Northwest Area neighborhood of the city. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. It is with five floors of exhibit halls and receives more than one million visitors annually. Its collection of over 120,000 artifacts and exhibit items is divided into three domains: the American Collection, the Cultural World Collection, and the Natural World Collection. Among the exhibits are a simulated Cretaceous dinosaur habitat, a carousel, a steam locomotive, and the glass sculpture Fireworks of Glass Tower and Ceiling. The museum's focus is family learning; most exhibits are designed to be interactive, allowing children and families to actively participate. Founded in 1925 by Mary Stewart Carey with the help of Indianapolis civic leaders and organizations, it is the fourth-oldest such institution in the world. The current site became home for the museum in 1946; the current building was constructed in 1976 and has had four major expansions since then. The museum hosts thousands of activities annually, including plays at the Lilly Theater, classes and workshops for school children, traveling exhibits, and fund-raising events. With a 2008 budget of $28.7 million, it has 400 employees and 1,500 volunteers. Its financial stability is ensured by a large endowment that was first established in the 1960s and is governed by a board of trustees. History The Children's Museum of Indianapolis was founded in 1925 by Mary Stewart Carey, a wealthy civic patron who owned the Stewart-Carey Glass Company. She was inspired to create the museum after a 1924 visit to the Brooklyn Children's Museum.Bodenhamer, p. 410 Carey began a campaign to start a children's museum in Indianapolis and enlisted the aid of other local civic leaders and the Progressive Teacher's Association. With their support, the museum opened in the carriage house of The Propylaeum, a local civic club.Danilov, p. 229 A board of trustees was established to manage the museum and Carey was elected its first president.Bodenhamer, p. 412 The early exhibits were created and donated by school children. Carey sought a larger facility and after two moves, she finally located the museum in her own mansion on Meridian Street in 1926. The same year the first curator, Arthur Carr was hired. Carr arranged Carey's specimens into exhibits and managed the museum. The first permanent exhibits were marine, Japanese, pioneer, archeology, and nature. By the 1940s, a larger staff was hired and Carr became director after Carey's 1938 death. The museum began offering guided tours to school children, organized traveling exhibits that were moved around to area schools, and began hosting events for fund raising.Bodenhamer, p. 411 Early members were given a Seahorse pin to identify them as Youth members. Museum lobby and atrium A mastodon skull exhibit. The museum encourages children to touch many of their exhibits, such as this one. In 1942, Carr retired from the museum and Grace Golden became the new director. Golden sought to further expand the museum and successfully solicited grants from the Indianapolis Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, and members of the Lilly family. She also secured several important corporate sponsorships. The new revenue allowed the museum to purchase its own building, a former mansion on North Meridian Street. Golden also began a diversification of the museum's exhibits, rather than relying on local donations. She successfully created partnerships with other museums who loaned exhibits of Native American artifacts in 1947, a gallery of dinosaur skeletons in 1949, the mummy Wenuhotep was given on permanent loan from the University of Chicago in 1959, a nineteenth-century log cabin was donated in 1961, and the Hall of Man was added in 1962. Several new permanent exhibits were created during her tenure, focusing on pioneer life, natural science, and ethnography. Golden also established a Junior Docent program, created two weekly television shows for local broadcast, and began a program of interpretive activities. In 1964, Golden resigned and was succeeded as director by Mildred Compton. Compton remained director until 1982. She created the first long-term financial plans for the museum by establishing an endowment and began advertising campaigns for donations and to increase attendance. The museum was enhanced to help it earn accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums by standardizing and cataloging its exhibits and archives and implementing conservation techniques. New permanent exhibits were obtained during Compton's tenure including the Physical Science Gallery in 1967, the Reuben Wells Steam Engine in 1968, and the Model Train Gallery in 1970. A fund raising drive held in 1973 raised $8.7 million and allowed for the construction of the current museum building. The old museum was demolished and the new one built on its site. Finished in 1976, the new museum had modern conservation and storage facilities, classrooms, the 350 seat Ruth Allison Lilly Theater, and a much larger five-floor exhibit area. New exhibits and attractions were added for the grand opening, including a carousel, a simulated cavern, and a mastodon skeleton. Peter Sterling became director in 1982 and continued to pursue a growth policy for the museum. A restaurant and outdoor garden gallery was added in 1983, and in 1984, the Caplan folk art collection of 50,000 items was donated by Frank and Theresa Caplan, nearly doubling the number of items owned by the museum. The museum also undertook a $14 million, multi-phase expansion that included construction of a welcome center and atrium entrance (completed in 1983), a planetarium, and an additional exhibit hall, completed in 1988. Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III designed the four-story atrium addition. A grant from Lilly Endowment funded the construction of the Eli Lilly Center for Exploration in 1990. See also: By 1992, the museum was hosting 4,000 programs and activities annually and had an annual attendance of 835,000 patrons. It employed 165 full-time employees, 227 part-time employees, and 850 volunteers. Revenue in 1992 was $12.4 million. In 1996, a 310-seat large-format theater called the CineDome was constructed adjacent to the museum. In 2004, the museum added a 950-space parking garage and the CineDome was converted to Dinosphere, which is built within and around the former CineDome. The Welcome Center was expanded again in 2009 increasing the total size of the museum to . The museum's current CEO Jeffrey H. Patchen was hired in 1999, after serving as a Senior Program Officer at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Operations In 2008, the institution had revenue of $26.37 million and expenses of $26.369 million, with over half its income being supplied by the museum's endowment.2008 Annual Report, p. 5 The facility had more than one million visitors in 2008.2008 Annual Report, p. 2 Field trips from 775 schools brought more than 83,000 students to the museum during 2008.2008 Annual Report, p. 16 In 2010, the museum had 400 part and full-time employees. Additionally, 1,500 individuals contribute over 65,000 hours of volunteer work annually. The museum has five floors of exhibit halls in the main building. There are several smaller structures around the main building including a planetarium, Dinosphere, a theater, and an outdoors garden gallery. In total, the museum has of floor space. The museum has a collection of over 120,000 artifacts, divided into three groups: Natural World, Cultural World, and American Collections. To maintain a regular change in its exhibits, significant emphasis is placed on research and development. Field experts are consulted regularly to assess the exhibits and offer proposals for new ones. The museum employs many experts who are leaders in their field of study.Sandler, p. 37 Because of its leadership and innovations, the museum is a world leader in its field.Sandler, p. 186 Child and Parents magazine have both ranked the museum as the best children's museum in the United States.

The main stairwell of the museum is a giant spiral ramp that allows visitors to access all five levels of the museum by strollers, wheelchairs, and walkers. In 2006, glass artist Dale Chihuly installed a four- story glass sculpture inside the central atrium of the giant spiral ramp. The sculpture is called Fireworks of Glass Tower and Ceiling and is accompanied by an exhibit of Chihuly's glass blowing methods. Lower Level The National Geographic: Treasures of the Earth exhibit, which includes three areas, is located on the Lower Level of the museum and was first opened on June 11, 2011. One area contains ancient Egyptian artifacts presented in a replica of the tomb of Seti I. Another area has a simulated archeological dig where artifacts about Ying Zheng, the first Emperor of China, were discovered. The third area features artifacts retrieved from a pirate shipwreck. The lower level also hosts a planetarium, the Lilly Theater,https://www.childrensmuseum.org/exhibits/lilly-theater/ and an steam engine designed by Reuben Wells in 1868 to conquer Indiana's Madison Hill. The engine is attached to a Pennsylvania Railroad tool car in the museum's \\"All Aboard!\\" Gallery. Main Floor On the main floor/ground level, the Museum has the Welcome Center with adult and juvenile Brachiosaur sculptures climbing into the front. These sculptures are physiologically accurate to current paleontological knowledge and were created by Gary Staab and painted by Brian Cooley who created the sauropod sculptures which are crashing out of the Dinosphere. Outside the museum on this level is the Seven Wonders of the World garden, a green rain garden, parking garage, and the oversize parking lot to accommodate large parties of visitors such as schools on field trips. A focal point of the ground level of the museum is North America's largest water clock, created by French physicist and artist Bernard Gitton. The main floor contains the museum's toy store and food court. The volunteer center, concierge desk, and birthday party rooms are also on this level. Second Floor The museum also contains a branch of the Indianapolis Public Library called the InfoZone. During the latest expansion in 2009, this space was moved to the second floor outside of the skywalk which links the parking garage to the main building. The second level hosts many of the museum's temporary exhibits. The only semi-permanent exhibit on the level is the \\"Take Me There\\" gallery. The \\"Take Me There\\" exhibit has its content changed periodically with a different culture represented in the space every two to three years. In 2009, the exhibit featured the culture of modern-day Egypt and is called \\"Take Me There: Egypt.\\" Starting from May 2014, the exhibit was changed to \\"Take Me There: China.\\" In June 2019, the exhibit was once again revamped to become \\"Take Me There: Greece.\\" Also on this floor are miniature insets depicting various rooms and their decorations. The three changeable spaces are known as Special Exhibit Galleries and they have short run exhibits that rotate. Opened in July 2012, \\"Stories from our Community\\" is a display that includes artifacts that illustrate stories from community members which are featured in the exhibit space. Visitors can sit at touch-screen displays and choose the stories that they would like to listen to or read. A related website is available that shares the stories on display, in addition to others. Third Floor The third level features \\"The Power of Children: Making a Difference\\", a permanent exhibit featuring the stories of Anne Frank, Ruby Bridges, and Ryan White and the impact these children made on the world. The purpose of the Power of Children is to create a supportive environment where people can examine and discuss issues related to prejudice and discrimination and seek solutions to these problems. Historically accurate, immersive environments are recreated to reflect the place where each of the children spent their lives. First-person interpreters, live theater, and artifacts are designed to facilitate the public understanding of the lives of Frank, Bridges and White. The gallery has sounds, dramatic lighting, quotations, interactives and moving images to draw visitors into the exhibit. The second exhibit on the third floor is Playscape, a learning and play area designed for children 5 years and younger. Originally opened in 1981, the museum carried out an extensive renovation of Playscape in 2013. The renovated gallery includes and improves upon many of the elements from the previous exhibit, such as a large sandbox area, a water play experience, and an area designated for small children 2 and younger. Fourth Floor One of the museum's most popular attractions is the Broad Ripple Park Carousel in the Carousel Wishes and Dreams gallery on the fourth floor. The carousel, whose animal figures were created by Dentzel, was originally installed in the White City Amusement Park in what is now Broad Ripple Park in 1917 and was restored and reinstalled in this museum in 1973. It is the largest of the museum's artifacts. The carousel is a National Historic Landmark. The music is provided by a rare Wurlitzer style #146-B Military Band Organ. The fourth level houses Science Works (formerly known as Science Spectrum), an exhibit devoted to exploring natural science and physical science through building activities. Children may build toy boats to float along the waterway, play in a construction zone, erect an arch, climb a rock wall, crawl through tunnels, observe a live pond, and participate in other activities. Within Science Works is the Biotech Lab, which hosts daily events focusing on the future of DNA and chemistry and SciencePort which focuses on plant biology. Dinosphere Panoramic view from Dinosphere Alamosaurus exhibit which is located outside of the Dinosphere Dinosphere is connected to the main museum on the Lower Level (through All Aboard), Level One (near the food court and main entrance gates), and Level Two (through The Mann Properties Gallery of Dinosaur Imagery). Dinosphere was formerly the CineDome Theater. Dinosphere features a sound and light experience that simulates a day in the late Cretaceous period 65 million years ago. The center of the exhibit space includes three themed fossil scenes. Visitors can perform fossil excavations in the Dig Site, touch a real Tyrannosaurus rex femur fossil in the Paleo Prep Lab, talk to real paleontologists, enjoy family-friendly games and touch-screen learning activities, and view numerous real dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous period on display. Dinosphere is one of the largest displays of juvenile and family dinosaur fossils in the U.S. The exhibit features several species of dinosaurs including Hypacrosaurus, Prenoceratops, Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, Gorgosaurus, Maiasaura, Bambiraptor, Oviraptor, and Dracorex hogwartsia. Several ancient non-dinosaur creatures are also featured, including Didelphodon, Sarcosuchus (super croc), and Pteranodon. Outdoor Sports Experience Opened in 2018, the exhibit offers many different sports activities for visiting family. Indoor areas include a gallery of sports art and an exhibit on the culture of sports. Outdoor areas include basketball, football, tennis, hockey, baseball, soccer, golf, two pedal race tracks, a tree-house, and a run/walk track that circles the outdoor exhibit.https://www.childrensmuseum.org/exhibits?category=sle See also *List of children's museums in the United States References Notes Bibliography  * External links *Museum website *Online collection Category:Museums established in 1925 Category:Museums in Indianapolis Category:Children's museums in Indiana Category:Institutions accredited by the American Alliance of Museums Category:Organisations using QRpedia Category:Dinosaur museums in the United States Category:Paleontology in Indiana Category:Natural history museums in Indiana Category:Science museums in Indiana Category:Transportation museums in Indiana Category:1925 establishments in Indiana ","title":"The Children's Museum of Indianapolis"},{"id":"3565381","text":"The MoMA Eve was a handheld gaming console presented by Via in 2004.

He gave up his tailor shop, and with his two sons formed James Richardson and Sons in 1857. The first Richardson elevator was built at Kingston in 1882, and another at Neepawa, Manitoba in 1890. James Richardson was the first to arrange the first shipment of wheat from western Canada through the lake system to Liverpool, England in 1883.

Built originally as the Lancaster-York Intercounty Bridge, construction began in 1929, and the bridge opened September 30, 1930. On November 11, 1980, it was officially dedicated as Veterans Memorial Bridge, though it is still referenced locally as the Columbia‚ÄìWrightsville Bridge. In nominating the present Columbia‚ÄìWrightsville Bridge as an engineering landmark, the Pennsylvania section of the American Society of Civil Engineers noted that it is \\"a splendid example of the graceful multiple-span, reinforced-concrete arched form popular in early 20th Century highway bridges in the United States.\\" The bridge is designated State Route 462 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is also a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Instead of being replaced by a name such as the Old Lincoln Highway, its name is a kept part of the historic Lincoln Highway in local naming, the nation's first transcontinental highway, connecting a series of local highways and stretching from New York City to San Francisco. The opening in 1940 of the cross-state Pennsylvania Turnpike, a part of Interstate 76, subsequently provided faster passage. History=Construction Designed by James B. Long and built by Glen Wiley and Glenway Maxon (Wiley-Maxon Construction Company), it cost $2,484,000 (equivalent to $ million in )), plus an early completion bonus of $56,400 (). Constructed of reinforced concrete, the bridge ( including spans over land) has 27 river piers, 22 approach piers, a two-lane roadway, and a sidewalk. of concrete and 8 million pounds of steel reinforcing rods were used, and coffer dams were built to aid in construction. Each span consists of three separate concrete ribs connected at five points by horizontal concrete struts, with the longest span measuring . Tolls of 25 cents per vehicle were charged when the bridge first opened () and ended on January 31, 1943, when the bond issue was retired. Some time after World War II, the original bridge lights were replaced with newer lighting. Two of the original bronze light fixtures can still be seen on the front lawn of the Frank Sahd Salvage Center along Route 462 in Columbia. Current In the 1970s, the state considered closing the bridge permanently due to the recently constructed Wright's Ferry Bridge nearby, but local residents objected. In the mid-1970s, it was given a major overhaul instead, and was closed only temporarily. A few years later, the bridge was once again closed briefly so that a weather-resistant coating could be applied to the roadway. Today, the bridge is maintained by PennDOT and is still considered the world's longest concrete multiple-arch bridge. Its annual average daily traffic (AADT) was 10,350 as of 2004. It is the fifth bridge to span the river at this general location. As of the first quarter of 2020, PennDOT said plans were underway to restore the bridge, while also: improving roadway intersections at both ends, connecting pedestrian and bicycle paths to river-side parks, and possibly addressing annual mayfly swarms by adding lights beneath the bridge. The project has an estimated $54 million cost and construction was projected to begin in the winter of 2022‚Äì2023. The other present-day Columbia-Wrightsville bridge is the Wright's Ferry Bridge, the sixth bridge to cross the river between the two towns. Also known as the Route 30 bridge, it stands about north of the Veterans Memorial Bridge. (Wright's Ferry was one of the original names of Columbia.) G.A. & F.C. Wagman, Inc. began its construction in March 1969, and the bridge opened on November 21, 1972. It was commissioned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the 1960s to relocate Route 30 and bypass the river towns of Wrightsville and Columbia. Costing $12 million, it is constructed of reinforced concrete and steel and has 46 equal sections on 45 piers. US 30 crosses it as an expressway (4-lane divided highway), and there is no walkway. Tolls were never collected on this bridge. About a year after its opening, the bridge was shut down briefly so that an experimental weather-resistant coating could be applied to its roadway. Previous bridges=First bridge Columbia- Wrightsville Bridge in 2014 (foreground) Construction of the first Columbia‚ÄìWrightsville Bridge was begun in 1812 and completed December 5, 1814, by J. Wolcott, H. Slaymaker, S. Slaymaker at a total cost of $231,771, which was underwritten by the newly formed Columbia Bank and Bridge Company. The bridge was long and wide and had 54 piers and twin carriageways. Constructed of wood and stone, the covered bridge also included a wooden roof, a whitewashed interior and openings in its wooden sides to admit light and allow a view of the river and surrounding areas. It stood immediately south of the present-day Wright's Ferry Bridge along Route 30. Tolls were $1.50 () for a wagon and six horses, and six cents for pedestrians (). It was considered the longest covered bridge in the world at the time. The bridge accommodated east‚Äìwest traffic across the Susquehanna River for 14 years before being destroyed by ice, high water and severe weather on February 5, 1832. Second bridge Construction of the second Columbia‚ÄìWrightsville Bridge, another covered bridge, started mid-1832 and was completed in 1834 (opening on July 8, 1834) by James Moore and John Evans at a cost of $157,300. It was long and wide and also enjoyed the distinction of being the world's longest covered bridge. The wood and stone structure had 27 piers, a carriageway, walkway, and two towpaths to guide canal traffic across the river. Tolls were $1.00 for a wagon and 6 horses (), and 6 cents per pedestrian (). Much of the mostly oak timber used in its construction was salvaged from the previous bridge. Its roof was covered with shingles, its sides with weatherboard, and its interior was whitewashed. The structure was modified in 1840 by the Canal Company at a cost of $40,000 concurrent with the construction of the Wrightsville Dam. Towpaths of different levels and with sidewalls were added to prevent horses from falling into river, as happened several times when the river flooded. The roof of the lower path formed the floor of upper path. In this way, canal boats were towed across the river from the Pennsylvania Canal on the Columbia side to the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal at Wrightsville. Sometime after 1846, a double-track railway was added, linking the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad to the Northern Central Railway. Due to fear of fire caused by locomotives, rail cars were pulled across the bridge by teams of mules or horses. =The second bridge's role during the Civil War= To prevent the advance of Confederate troops across the river from the Wrightsville (York County) side during the Civil War, the bridge was burned by Union militia under Maj. Granville O. Haller and Col. Jacob G. Frick on June 28, 1863. Civilian volunteers from Columbia had mined the bridge at the fourth span from the Wrightsville side, originally hoping to drop the whole span into the river, but when the charges were detonated, only small portions of the support arch splintered, leaving the span passable. As Confederates advanced onto the bridge, Union forces set fire to it near the Wrightsville side. Earlier they had saturated the structure with crude oil from a Columbia refinery. The entire structure soon caught fire and completely burned in six hours. Confederate generals Jubal A. Early and John B. Gordon had originally planned to save the bridge despite orders from General Robert E. Lee to burn it, and Union forces under the command of Colonel Jacob G. Frick had burned the bridge, originally hoping to defend and save it. Afterwards, the Columbia Bank and Bridge Company appealed to the federal government for reimbursement for damages incurred from the bridge burning, but none were ever paid. Conservative estimates put the cost of damages with interest today at well over $170 million. In 1864, the bank sold all interest in the bridge and bridge piers to the Pennsylvania Railroad for $57,000. Third bridge Construction of the third Columbia-Wrightsville bridge was started in 1868 by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The covered bridge (5,390 feet long) was completed later that year at a cost of $400,000. Built of stone, wood, and steel, it included 27 piers, a carriageway, railway, and walkway. It was destroyed September 30, 1896 by the 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane. Fourth bridge The Columbia‚ÄìWrightsville Bridge looking east from Wrightsville Construction of the fourth Columbia-Wrightsville bridge, known as the Pennsylvania Railroad \\"Iron Bridge,\\" started April 16, 1897, and was completed May 11, and was considered the fastest bridge-building job in the world at the time. A steel truss bridge made of prefabricated sections, it was designed to be resistant to fire, ice, water and wind, elements that had destroyed previous wooden structures. Like the previous bridges, tolls were collected to recover a portion of the half-million dollar investment. Built on the same 27 piers as the previous two bridges, it opened June 7, 1897. The iron and prefabricated steel structure had a railway to carry rail traffic for the York Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and twin carriageways that were shared with pedestrians. Tolls were 20 cents () for vehicles (plus four cents per passenger; ) and three cents for pedestrians (). The bridge remained uncompleted because a planned upper deck was never built. With the completion of the Lincoln Highway in 1925, vehicular traffic routinely jammed in the late 1920s when vehicles had to wait for trains to pass before crossing the bridge, since the bridge was shared with rail traffic. A fifth bridge (Veterans' Memorial Bridge) was planned and erected to accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The \\"Iron Bridge\\" carried passenger trains until 1954 and freight traffic until March 13, 1958, and was dismantled for scrap starting in 1963 and ending in November 1964. Its stone piers, dating to pre-Civil War times, still stand today, running parallel to the north side of the Veterans' Memorial Bridge.

It survives, very differently named: the driver of a train waiting at a signal on a running line must remind the signaller of its presence. Inside a signal box on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. Note the wooden collar on the third lever denoting a train standing on the running line. Rule 55 was introduced following a spate of accidents caused by signalmen forgetting that trains were standing on a running line, sometimes within sight of their signal boxes. It required that, if a train was brought to a stand at a signal, within three minutes in clear weather or immediately in rain, snow, or fog, the driver of the train must despatch his fireman, guard, or any shunter riding on the train, to the signal box to ensure that the signalman was aware of the presence of the train, and that all safeguards to protect it, such as slides or collars on the signal levers, were in place, the crewman then signing the train register to confirm this. In practice, this meant a cautious trudge, in whatever weather, for the crewman (although there was usually a mug of tea to be had in the signal box). Occasionally the rule was obeyed to the following extent: the crewman merely exchanged a greeting with the signalman, signed the register and returned to the train. In many cases, such as at major junctions or marshalling yards where crewmen crossing the rails were in grave danger from moving trains, the rule could not be applied properly (see exemption white diamond pictured). Further, the need for the fireman to return to the train would delay it if the signal was cleared in the meantime.  Accidents  Failure to apply the rule properly was a factor in several railway accidents in the period from 1890 onwards. At Thirsk and Hawes Junction, the crews of the standing trains failed to carry out the rule. At Quintinshill, the fireman of the standing train signed the register but did not ensure that the signalman had put the necessary safeguards in place. A semaphore signal fitted with a diamond sign indicating there is no need to contact the signaller It is impossible to know precisely how many accidents were prevented by the proper observation of the rule, and it could not always prevent a crash. At Winwick, a train was brought to a stand some distance from the signal box. The fireman left promptly to carry out the rule, but he had not reached the signal box before his train was struck. To prevent such occurrences, 'call plungers' (which operate an indicator in the signal box when pressed) or telephones were installed at some signal posts, or track circuits installed. However, even this solution was not completely foolproof e.g. at Castlecary in 1937, the signalman observed that a train had passed a signal at danger, possibly due to a false signal indication, and assumed it had continued on past his signal box. The signalman failed to check his track circuit indicators, which would have shown that the train stopped, and the fireman arrived in the signal box moments too late to stop the signalman accepting a following express train. Full interlocking with track circuits and signal indications might have prevented this accident.  Exemption  A white diamond sign on a signal post means that the driver is not required to contact the signaller because a telephone is not provided, but the presence of the train or shunting movement is indicated to the signaller by detection. Modernised rule Pressing the SG button on a driver's cab radio will send a \\"Train standing at signal\\" message. The principle of Rule 55 continues ‚Äì though from 2003 (and as of 2019) the rule is identified rather differently. Rule Book (GE/RT8000) Module S4 Section 1 (Contacting the signaller - standard arrangements), revised 2015, states (1.1 When to contact the signaller): > Driver - When your train is detained on a running line at a signal at > danger, or without a movement authority (MA), you must contact the signaller > as soon as possible. However, you may wait for up to two minutes before > contacting the signaller if you can see an obvious reason for the signal > being at danger, or not having an MA[,] such as: ‚Ä¢ the section ahead being > occupied by a train ‚Ä¢ a conflicting movement being made. If the signaller > has told you to wait for the signal to clear, or for an MA, you must contact > the signaller again every five minutes unless the signaller has given you > other instructions. Modern technology such as signal post telephones, in-cab radio, and mobile phones means that it is rarely necessary for train crew to visit the signal box. In fact, the driver does not even need to speak to the signaller as pressing the \\"SG\\" button on CSR and GSM-R radios will send a \\"Train standing at signal\\" text message.

Consisting of the main islands Trinidad and Tobago, and numerous much smaller islands, it is situated south of Grenada and off the coast of northeastern Venezuela. It shares maritime boundaries with Barbados to the northeast, Grenada to the northwest, Guyana to the southeast, and Venezuela to the south and west. The island of Trinidad was inhabited for centuries by native Amerindian peoples before becoming a colony in the Spanish Empire, following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498. Spanish governor Don Jos√© Mar√≠a Chac√≥n surrendered the island to a British fleet under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797. During the same period, the island of Tobago changed hands among Spanish, British, French, Dutch and Courlander colonisers more times than any other island in the Caribbean. Trinidad and Tobago were ceded to Britain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens as separate states and unified in 1889. Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence in 1962, becoming a republic in 1976. Trinidad and Tobago has the third highest GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP) in the Americas after the United States and Canada. It is recognised by the World Bank as a high-income economy. Unlike most Caribbean nations and territories, which rely heavily on tourism, the Trinidadian economy is primarily industrial with an emphasis on petroleum and petrochemicals; much of the nation's wealth is derived from its large reserves of oil and natural gas.List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita Trinidad and Tobago is well known for its African and Indian cultures, reflected in its large and famous Carnival, Diwali, and Hosay celebrations, as well being the birthplace of steelpan, the limbo, and music styles such as calypso, soca, rapso, parang, chutney, and chutney soca. Toponymy Historian E. L. Joseph claimed that Trinidad's Amerindian name was Cairi or \\"Land of the Humming Bird\\", derived from the Arawak name for hummingbird, ier√®tt√™ or yerett√™. However, other authors dispute this etymology with some claiming that cairi does not mean hummingbird (tukusi or tucuchi being suggested as the correct word) and some claiming that kairi, or iere, simply means island. Christopher Columbus renamed it \\"La Isla de la Trinidad\\" (\\"The Island of the Trinity\\"), fulfilling a vow made before setting out on his third voyage of exploration.Hart, Marie. (1965). The New Trinidad and Tobago, p. 13. London and Glasgow: Collins. Reprint 1972. Tobago's cigar-like shape, or the use of tobacco by the native people, may have given it its Spanish name (cabaco, tavaco, tobacco) and possibly some of its other Amerindian names, such as Alouba√©ra (black conch) and Urupaina (big snail),Boomert, Arie. Trinidad, Tobago and the Lower Orinoco Interaction Sphere: An archaeological/ethnohistorical study. Universiteit Leiden, 2000, although the English pronunciation is . History=Indigenous peoples Both Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by Amerindians who came through South America. Trinidad was first settled by pre-agricultural Archaic people at least 7,000 years ago, making it the earliest settled part of the Caribbean. Banwari Trace in south-west Trinidad is the oldest attested archaeological site in the Caribbean, dating to about 5000 BC. Several waves of migration occurred over the following centuries, which can be identified by differences in their archaeological remains. At the time of European contact, Trinidad was occupied by various Arawakan-speaking groups including the Nepoya and Suppoya, and Cariban-speaking groups such as the Yao, while Tobago was occupied by the Island Caribs and Galibi. Trinidad was known to the native peoples as 'Ieri' ('Land of the Humming Bird'). European colonization Christopher Columbus was the first European to see Trinidad, on his third voyage to the Americas in 1498. He also reported seeing Tobago on the distant horizon, naming it Bellaforma, but did not land on the island. Sir Walter Raleigh raiding Spanish settlement in Trinidad in 1595 In the 1530s Antonio de Sede√±o, a Spanish soldier intent on conquering the island of Trinidad, landed on its southwest coast with a small army of men, intending to subdue the Amerindian peoples of the island. Sede√±o and his men fought the native peoples on many occasions, and subsequently built a fort. The next few decades were generally spent in warfare with the native peoples, until in 1592, the 'Cacique' (native chief) Wannawanare (also known as Guanaguanare) granted the area around modern Saint Joseph to Domingo de Vera e Ibarg√ºen, and withdrew to another part of the island. The settlement of San Jos√© de Oru√±a was later established by Antonio de Berr√≠o on this land in 1592. Shortly thereafter the English sailor Sir Walter Raleigh arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 in search of the long- rumoured \\"El Dorado\\" ('City of Gold') supposedly located in South America. He attacked San Jos√©, captured and interrogated Antonio de Berr√≠o, and obtained much information from him and from the Cacique Topiawari; Raleigh then went on his way, and Spanish authority was restored. Meanwhile, there were numerous attempts by European powers to settle Tobago during the 1620-40s, with the Dutch, English and Courlanders (people from the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, now part of Latvia) all attempting to colonise the island with little success. From 1654 the Dutch and Courlanders managed to gain a more secure foothold, later joined by several hundred French settlers. A plantation economy developed based on the production of sugar, indigo and rum, worked by large numbers of African slaves who soon came to vastly outnumber the European colonists. Large numbers of forts were constructed as Tobago became a source of contention between France, Netherlands and Britain, with the island changing hands some 31 times prior to 1814, a situation exacerbated by widespread piracy. The British managed to hold Tobago from 1762‚Äì1781, whereupon it was captured by the French, who ruled until 1793 when Britain re- captured the island. The 17th century on Trinidad passed largely without major incident, but sustained attempts by the Spaniards to control and rule over the Amerindians were often fiercely resisted. In 1687 the Catholic Catalan Capuchin friars were given responsibility for the conversions of the indigenous people of Trinidad and the Guianas. They founded several missions in Trinidad, supported and richly funded by the state, which also granted encomienda right to them over the native peoples, in which the native peoples were forced to provide labour for the Spanish. One such mission was Santa Rosa de Arima, established in 1789, when Amerindians from the former encomiendas of Tacarigua and Arauca (Arouca) were relocated further west. Escalating tensions between the Spaniards and Amerindians culminated in violence 1689, when Amerindians in the San Rafael encomienda rebelled and killed several priests, attacked a church, and killed the Spanish governor Jos√© de Le√≥n y Echales. Among those killed in the governor's party was Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Cuara, Tacarigua and Arauca. The Spanish retaliated severely, slaughtering hundreds of native peoples in an event that became known as the Arena massacre. As a result of this, continuing Spanish slave-raiding, and the devastating impact of introduced disease to which they had no immunity, the native population was virtually wiped out by the end of the following century. During this period Trinidad was an island province belonging to the Viceroyalty of New Spain, together with Central America, present-day Mexico and the southwestern United States.Besson, Gerard (27 August 2000). \\"Land of Beginnings ‚Äì A historical digest\\", Newsday Newspaper. In 1757 the capital was moved from San Jos√© de Oru√±a to Puerto de Espa√±a (modern Port of Spain) following several pirate attacks. However the Spanish never made any concerted effort to colonise the islands; Trinidad in this period was still mostly forest, populated by a few Spaniards with a handful of slaves and a few thousand Amerindians. Indeed, the population in 1777 was only 1,400, and Spanish colonisation in Trinidad remained tenuous. =Influx of French settlers= Since Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a C√©dula de Poblaci√≥n from the Spanish king Charles III on 4 November 1783. A C√©dula de Poblaci√≥n had previously been granted in 1776 by the king, but had not shown results, and therefore the new C√©dula was more generous. It granted free land and tax exemption for 10 years to Roman Catholic foreign settlers who were willing to swear allegiance to the King of Spain. The Spanish also gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including exemption from taxes for ten years and land grants in accordance with the terms set out in the C√©dula. The land grant was 30 fanegas (13 hectares/32 acres) for each free man, woman and child and half of that for each slave that they brought with them. The Spanish sent a new governor, Jos√© Mar√≠a Chac√≥n, to implement the terms of the new c√©dula. It was fortuitous that the C√©dula was issued only a few years before the French Revolution. During that period of upheaval, French planters with their slaves, free coloureds and mulattos from the neighbouring islands of Martinique, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to Trinidad, where they established an agriculture-based economy (sugar and cocoa). These new immigrants established local communities in Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage and Laventille. As a result, Trinidad's population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, and by 1797 the population of Port of Spain had increased from under 3,000 to 10,422 in just five years, with a varied population of mixed race individuals, Spaniards, Africans, French republican soldiers, retired pirates and French nobility. The total population of Trinidad was 17,718, of which 2,151 were of European ancestry, 4,476 were \\"free blacks and people of colour\\", 10,009 were enslaved people and 1,082 Amerindians. The sparse settlement and slow rate of population-increase during Spanish rule (and even later during British rule) made Trinidad one of the less populated colonies of the West Indies, with the least developed plantation infrastructure. British rule  British in 1797. The British had begun to take a keen interest in Trinidad, and in 1797 a British force led by General Sir Ralph Abercromby launched an invasion of Trinidad. His squadron sailed through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of Chaguaramas. Seriously outnumbered, Governor Chac√≥n decided to capitulate to British without fighting. Trinidad thus became a British crown colony, with a largely French- speaking population and Spanish laws. British rule was later formalised under the Treaty of Amiens (1802). The colony's first British governor was Thomas Picton, however his heavy-handed approach to enforcing British authority, including the use of torture and arbitrary arrest, led to his being recalled. British rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. English, Scots, Irish, German and Italian families arrived, as well as some free blacks known as 'Merikins' who had fought for Britain in the War of 1812 and were granted land in southern Trinidad. Under British rule, new states were created and the importation of slaves increased, however by this time support for abolitionism had vastly increased and in England the slave trade was under attack.Brereton, Bridget (1981). A History of Modern Trinidad 1783‚Äì1962. London: Heinemann Educational Books Slavery was abolished in 1833, after which former slaves served an \\"apprenticeship\\" period. In 1837 Daaga, a West African slave trader who had been captured by Portuguese slavers and later rescued by the British navy, was conscripted into the local regiment. Daaga and a group of his compatriots mutinied at the barracks in St Joseph and set out eastward in an attempt to return to their homeland. The mutineers were ambushed by a militia unit just outside the town of Arima. The revolt was crushed at the cost of some 40 dead, and Daaga and his party were later executed at St Joseph. The apprenticeship system ended on 1 August 1838 with full emancipation. An overview of the populations statistics in 1838, however, clearly reveals the contrast between Trinidad and its neighbouring islands: upon emancipation of the slaves in 1838, Trinidad had only 17,439 slaves, with 80% of slave owners having enslaved fewer than 10 people each. In contrast, at twice the size of Trinidad, Jamaica had roughly 360,000 slaves. =Arrival of Indian Indentured Labourers= indentured Indian labourers in Trinidad and Tobago. After the African slaves were emancipated many refused to continue working on the plantations, often moving out to urban areas such as Laventille and Belmont to the east of Port of Spain. As a result a severe agricultural labour shortage emerged. The British filled this gap by instituting a system of indentureship. Various nationalities were contracted under this system, including Indians, Chinese, and Portuguese. Of these, the East Indians were imported in the largest numbers, starting from 1 May 1845, when 225 Indians were brought in the first shipment to Trinidad on the Fatel Razack, a Muslim-owned vessel. Indentureship of the Indians lasted from 1845 to 1917, during which time more than 147,000 Indians came to Trinidad to work on sugarcane plantations.Deen, Shamshu (1994). Solving East Indian Roots in Trinidad. Freeport Junction. H.E.M. Enterprise. Indentureship contracts were sometimes exploitative, to such an extent that historians such as Hugh Tinker were to call it \\"a new system of slavery\\". Despite these descriptions, it was not truly a new form of slavery, as workers were paid, contracts were finite, and the idea of an individual being another's property had been eliminated when slavery was abolished. In addition, employers of indentured labour had no legal right to flog or whip their workers; the main legal sanction for the enforcement of the indenture laws was prosecution in the courts, followed by fines or (more likely) jail sentences. People were contracted for a period of five years, with a daily wage as low as 25 cents in the early 20th century, and they were guaranteed return passage to India at the end of their contract period. However, coercive means were often used to retain labourers, and the indentureship contracts were soon extended to 10 years from 1854 after the planters complained that they were losing their labour too early. In lieu of the return passage, the British authorities soon began offering portions of land to encourage settlement, and by 1902, more than half of the sugar cane in Trinidad was being produced by independent cane farmers; the majority of which were Indians. Despite the trying conditions experienced under the indenture system, about 90% of the Indian immigrants chose, at the end of their contracted periods of indenture, to make Trinidad their permanent home. East Indians entering the colony were also subject to certain crown laws which segregated them from the rest of Trinidad's population, such as the requirement that they carry a pass with them if they left the plantations, and that if freed, they carry their \\"Free Papers\\" or certificate indicating completion of the indenture period.Mohammed, Patricia (2002). Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad 1917‚Äì1947. Palgrave Macmillan. Colonial flag of Trinidad and Tobago, 1889‚Äì1958 Few Indians settled on Tobago however, and the descendants of African slaves continued to form the majority of the island's population. An ongoing economic slump in the middle-to-late 19th century caused widespread poverty. Discontent erupted into rioting on the Roxborough plantation in 1876, in an event known as the Belmanna Uprising after a policeman who was killed. The British eventually managed to restore control, however as a result of the disturbances Tobago's Legislative Assembly voted to dissolve itself and the island became a Crown colony in 1877. With the sugar industry in a state of near-collapse and the island no longer profitable, the British attached Tobago to their Trinidad colony in 1899. =Early 20th century= In 1903, a protest against the introduction of new water rates in Port of Spain erupted into rioting; 18 people were shot dead, and the Red House (the government headquarters) was damaged by fire. A local elected assembly with some limited powers was introduced in 1913. Economically Trinidad and Tobago remained a predominantly agricultural colony; alongside sugarcane, the cacao (cocoa) crop also contributed greatly to economic earnings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In November 1919, the dockworkers went on strike over bad management practises, low wages compared to a higher cost of living. Strikebreakers were brought in to keep a minimum of goods moving through the ports. On December 1, 1919, the striking dockworkers rushed the harbour and chased off the strikebreakers. They then proceeded to march on the government buildings in Port of Spain. Other unions and workers, many with the same grievances, joined the dock worker's strike making it a General Strike. Violence broke out and was only put down with help from the sailors of British Naval ship . The unity brought upon by the strike was the first time of cooperation between the various ethnic groups of the time. Historian Brinsley Samaroo says that the 1919 strikes \\"seem to indicate that there was a growing class consciousness after the war and this transcended racial feelings at times.\\" However, in the 1920s, the collapse of the sugarcane industry, concomitant with the failure of the cocoa industry, resulted in widespread depression among the rural and agricultural workers in Trinidad, and encouraged the rise of a labour movement. Conditions on the islands worsened in the 1930s with the onset of the Great Depression, with an outbreak of labour riots occurring in 1937 which resulted in several deaths. The labour movement aimed to unite the urban working class and agricultural labour class; the key figures being Arthur Cipriani, who led the Trinidad Workingmen's Association (TWA), and Tubal Uriah \\"Buzz\\" Butler of the British Empire Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party. As the movement developed calls for greater autonomy from British colonial rule became widespread; this effort was severely undermined by the British Home Office and by the British-educated Trinidadian elite, many of whom were descended from the plantocracy class. A soldier at Waller Air Force Base, leased by Britain to America in the 1940s Petroleum had been discovered in 1857, but became economically significant only in the 1930s and afterwards as a result of the collapse of sugarcane and cocoa, and increasing industrialisation.The New Trinidad & Tobago ‚Äì from the original by Jos. A. De Suze (1846‚Äì1941), Collins, 1965. Reprint 1972. Trinidad and Tobago's Oil: An Illustrated Survey of the Oil Industry in Trinidad and Tobago. The Petroleum Association of Trinidad and Tobago. 1952. By the 1950s petroleum had become a staple in Trinidad's export market, and was responsible for a growing middle class among all sections of the Trinidad population. The collapse of Trinidad's major agricultural commodities, followed by the Depression, and the rise of the oil economy, led to major changes in the country's social structure. The presence of American military bases in Chaguaramas and Cumuto in Trinidad during World War II had a profound effect on society. The Americans vastly improved the infrastructure on Trinidad and provided many locals with well-paying jobs; however the social effects of having so many young soldiers stationed on the island, as well as their often unconcealed racial prejudice, caused resentment. The Americans left in 1961. In the post-war period the British began a process of decolonisation across the British Empire. In 1945 universal suffrage was introduced to Trinidad and Tobago. Political parties emerged on the island, however these were largely divided along racial lines: Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians primarily supported the People's National Movement (PNM), formed in 1956 by Eric Williams, with Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians mostly supporting the People's Democratic Party (PDP), formed in 1953 by Bhadase Sagan Maraj, which later merged into the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) in 1957. Britain's Caribbean colonies formed the West Indies Federation in 1958 as a vehicle for independence, however the Federation dissolved after Jamaica withdrew following a membership referendum in 1961. The government of Trinidad and Tobago subsequently chose to seek independence from the United Kingdom on its own. Contemporary era Trinidad and Tobago gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 31 August 1962. Elizabeth II remained head of state as Queen of Trinidad and Tobago, represented locally by Governor-General Solomon Hochoy. Eric Williams of the PNM, a noted historian and intellectual widely regarded as The Father of The Nation, became the first Prime Minister, serving in that capacity uninterrupted until 1981. The dominant figure in the opposition in the early independence years was Rudranath Capildeo of the DLP. The 1960s saw the rise of a Black Power movement, inspired in part by the civil rights movement in the United States. Protests and strikes became common, with events coming to head in April 1970 when police shot dead a protester named Basil Davis. Fearing a breakdown of law and order, Prime Minister Williams declared a state of emergency and arrested many of the Black Power leaders. Some army leaders who were sympathetic to the Black Power movement, notably Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, attempted to mutiny; however, this was quashed by the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard. Williams and the PNM retained power, largely due to divisions in the opposition. In 1963 Tobago was struck by Hurricane Flora, which killed 30 people and resulted in enormous destruction across the island. Partly as a result of this, tourism came to replace agriculture as the island's main income earner in the subsequent decades. Between the years 1972 and 1983, the country profited greatly from the rising price of oil and the discovery of vast new oil deposits in its territorial waters, resulting in an economic boom that increased living standards greatly. In 1976 the country became a republic within the Commonwealth, though it retained the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as its final appellate court. The position of governor-general was replaced with that of President; Ellis Clarke was the first to hold this largely ceremonial role.Paul Donovan, \\"Obituary: Sir Ellis Clarke\\", Independent Catholic News, 1 February 2011. Tobago was granted limited self- rule with the creation of the Tobago House of Assembly in 1980. Williams died in 1981, being replaced by George Chambers who led the country until 1986. By this time a fall in the price of oil had resulted in a recession, causing rising inflation and unemployment. The main opposition parties united under the banner of National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) and won the 1986 Trinidad and Tobago general election, with NAR leader A. N. R. Robinson becoming the new Prime Minister.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p630 Robinson was unable to hold together the fragile NAR coalition, and social unrest was caused by his economic reforms, such as devaluing the currency and implementing an International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment Program. In 1990 114 members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen, led by Yasin Abu Bakr (formerly known as Lennox Phillip) stormed the Red House (the seat of Parliament), and Trinidad and Tobago Television, the only television station in the country at the time, holding Robinson and country's government hostage for six days before surrendering. The coup leaders were promised amnesty, but upon their surrender they were then arrested, but later released after protracted legal wrangling. The PNM under Patrick Manning returned to power following the 1991 Trinidad and Tobago general election. Hoping to capitalise on an improvement in the economy, Manning called an early election in 1995, however, this resulted in a hung parliament. Two NAR representatives backed the opposition United National Congress (UNC), which had split off from the NAR in 1989, and they thus took power under Basdeo Panday, who became the country's first Indo-Trinidadian Prime Minister. After a period of political confusion caused by a series of inconclusive election results, Patrick Manning returned to power in 2001, retaining that position until 2010. Since 2003 the country entered a second oil boom, and petroleum, petrochemicals and natural gas continue to be the backbone of the economy. Tourism and the public service are the mainstay of the economy of Tobago, though authorities have attempted to diversify the island's economy. A corruption scandal resulted in Manning's defeat by the newly formed People's Partnership coalition in 2010, with Kamla Persad-Bissessar becoming the country's first female Prime Minister.

Geography A map of Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad and Tobago's topography Trinidad and Tobago is situated between 10¬∞ 2' and 11¬∞ 12' N latitude and 60¬∞ 30' and 61¬∞ 56' W longitude, with the Caribbean Sea to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south, and the Gulf of Paria to the west. It is located in the far south-east of the Caribbean region, with the island of Trinidad being just off the coast of Venezuela in mainland South America across the Columbus Channel. Covering an area of , the country consists of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago, separated by a 20m (30 km) strait, plus a number of much smaller islands, including Chacachacare, Monos, Huevos, Gaspar Grande (or Gasparee), Little Tobago, and Saint Giles Island. Trinidad is in area (comprising 93.0% of the country's total area) with an average length of and an average width of . Tobago has an area of about , or 5.8% of the country's area, is long and at its greatest width. Trinidad and Tobago lie on the continental shelf of South America, and are thus geologically considered to lie entirely in South America. The terrain of the islands is a mixture of mountains and plains. On Trinidad the Northern Range runs parallel with the north coast, and contains the country's highest peak (El Cerro del Aripo), which is above sea level and second highest (El Tucuche, ). The rest of the island is generally flatter, excluding the Central Range and Montserrat Hills in the centre of the island and the Southern Range and Trinity Hills in the south. The east coast is noted for its beaches, most notably Manzanilla Beach. The island contains several large swamp areas, such as the Caroni Swamp and the Nariva Swamp. Major bodies of water on Trinidad include the Hollis Reservoir, Navet Reservoir, Caroni Reservoir. Trinidad is made up of a variety of soil types, the majority being fine sands and heavy clays. The alluvial valleys of the Northern Range and the soils of the East‚ÄìWest Corridor are the most fertile. Trinidad is also notable for containing Pitch Lake, the largest natural reservoir of asphalt in the world. Tobago contains a flat plain in its south-west, with the eastern half of the island being more mountainous, culminating in Pigeon Peak, the island's highest point at . Tobago also contains several coral reefs off its coast. The majority of the population reside on the island of Trinidad, and this is thus the location of largest towns and cities. There are four major municipalities in Trinidad: the capital Port of Spain, San Fernando, Arima and Chaguanas. The main town on Tobago is Scarborough. Geology The Northern Range consists mainly of Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous metamorphic rocks. The Northern Lowlands (the East‚ÄìWest Corridor and Caroni Plain) consist of younger shallow marine clastic sediments. South of this, the Central Range fold and thrust belt consists of Cretaceous and Eocene sedimentary rocks, with Miocene formations along the southern and eastern flanks. The Naparima Plain and the Nariva Swamp form the southern shoulder of this uplift. The Southern Lowlands consist of Miocene and Pliocene sands, clays, and gravels. These overlie oil and natural gas deposits, especially north of the Los Bajos Fault. The Southern Range forms the third anticlinal uplift. The rocks consist of sandstones, shales, siltstones and clays formed in the Miocene and uplifted in the Pleistocene. Oil sands and mud volcanoes are especially common in this area. Climate Pitch Lake, in south-west Trinidad Trinidad and Tobago has a maritime tropical climate. There are two seasons annually: the dry season for the first five months of the year, and the rainy season in the remaining seven of the year. Winds are predominantly from the northeast and are dominated by the northeast trade winds. Unlike many Caribbean islands Trinidad and Tobago lies outside the main hurricane alleys; nevertheless, the island of Tobago was struck by Hurricane Flora on September 30, 1963. In the Northern Range of Trinidad, the climate is often cooler than that of the sweltering heat of the plains below, due to constant cloud and mist cover, and heavy rains in the mountains. Record temperatures for Trinidad and Tobago are for the high in Port of Spain, and a low of . Biodiversity Mayaro Beach, in the southeastern area of Trinidad Because Trinidad and Tobago lies on the continental shelf of South America, and in ancient times were physically connected to the South American mainland, its biological diversity is unlike that of most other Caribbean islands, and has much more in common with that of Venezuela. The main ecosystems are: coastal and marine (coral reefs, mangrove swamps, open ocean and seagrass beds); forest; freshwater (rivers and streams); karst; man-made ecosystems (agricultural land, freshwater dams, secondary forest); and savanna. On 1 August 1996, Trinidad and Tobago ratified the 1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, and it has produced a biodiversity action plan and four reports describing the country's contribution to biodiversity conservation. These reports formally acknowledged the importance of biodiversity to the well-being of the country's people through provision of ecosystem services. Leatherback Turtles Information about vertebrates is good, with 472 bird species (2 endemics), about 100 mammals, about 90 reptiles (a few endemics), about 30 amphibians (including several endemics), 50 freshwater fish and at least 950 marine fish. Notable mammal species include the ocelot, West Indian manatee, collared peccary (known as the quenk locally), red-rumped agouti, lappe, red brocket deer, Neotropical river otter, weeper capuchin and red howler monkey; there are also some 70 species of bat, including the vampire bat and fringe-lipped bat.. The larger reptiles present include 5 species of marine turtles known to nest on the islands' beaches, the green anaconda, the Boa constrictor and the spectacled caiman. There are at least 47 species of snakes, including only four dangerous venomous species (only in Trinidad and not in Tobago), lizards such as the green iguana, the cryptic golden tegu and a few species of fresh water turtles and land tortoises. are present. Of the amphibians, the golden tree frog is found only in the highest peaks of Trinidad's Northern Range and nearby in those of Venezuela's Paria Peninsula. Marine life is abundant, with several species of sea urchin, coral, lobster, anemone, starfish, manta ray, dolphin, porpoise and whale shark present in the islands' waters. The introduced lionfish is viewed as a pest, as it eats many native species of fish and has no natural predators; efforts are currently underway to cull the numbers of this species. Trinidad and Tobago is noted particularly for its large number of bird species, and is a popular destination for bird watchers. Notable species include the scarlet ibis, cocrico, egret, shiny cowbird, bananaquit, oilbird and various species of honeycreeper, trogon, toucan, parrot, tanager, woodpecker, antbird, kites, hawks, boobies, pelicans and vultures; there are also 17 species of hummingbird, including the tufted coquette which is the world's third smallest. Information about invertebrates is dispersed and very incomplete. About 650 butterflies, at least 672 beetles (from Tobago alone) and 40 corals have been recorded. Other notable invertebrates include the cockroach, leaf-cutter ant and numerous species of mosquitoes, termites, spiders and tarantulas. Although the list is far from complete, 1,647 species of fungi, including lichens, have been recorded.Dennis, R.W.G. \\"Fungus Flora of Venezuela and Adjacent Countries\\". Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1970. The true total number of fungi is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. (2008) Dictionary of the Fungi. Edn 10. CABI A first effort to estimate the number of endemic fungi tentatively listed 407 species. Information about micro-organisms is dispersed and very incomplete. Nearly 200 species of marine algae have been recorded. The true total number of micro-organism species must be much higher. Thanks to a recently published checklist, plant diversity in Trinidad and Tobago is well documented with about 3,300 species (59 endemic) recorded. Despite significant felling, forests still cover about 40% of the country, and there are about 350 different species of tree. A notable tree is the manchineel which is extremely poisonous to humans, and even just touching its sap can cause severe blistering of the skin; the tree is often covered with warning signs. Threats to the country's biodiversity include over-hunting and poaching (see Hunting#Trinidad and Tobago), habitat loss and fragmentation (particularly due to forest fires and land clearance for quarrying, agriculture, squatting, housing and industrial development and road construction), water pollution, and introduction of invasive species and pathogens. Politics The Red House, Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament Building President's House, official residence and office of the President Whitehall, official office of the Prime Minister Trinidad and Tobago is a republic with a two-party system and a bicameral parliamentary system based on the Westminster System. The head of state of Trinidad and Tobago is the President, currently Paula-Mae Weekes. This largely ceremonial role replaced that of the Governor-General (representing the Monarch of Trinidad and Tobago) upon Trinidad and Tobago's becoming a republic in 1976. The head of government is the Prime Minister, currently Keith Rowley. The President is elected by an Electoral college consisting of the full membership of both houses of Parliament. The Prime Minister is elected following a general election which takes place every five years. The President is required to appoint the leader of the party who in his or her opinion has the most support of the members of the House of Representatives to this post; this has generally been the leader of the party which won the most seats in the previous election (except in the case of the 2001 General Elections). Since 1980 Tobago has also had its own elections, separate from the general elections. In these elections, members are elected and serve in the unicameral Tobago House of Assembly. Parliament consists of the Senate (31 seats) and the House of Representatives (41 seats, plus the Speaker). The members of the Senate are appointed by the president; 16 Government Senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, six Opposition Senators are appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, currently Kamla Persad-Bissessar, and nine Independent Senators are appointed by the President to represent other sectors of civil society. The 41 members of the House of Representatives are elected by the people for a maximum term of five years in a \\"first past the post\\" system.  Administrative divisions  Regional corporations and municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad is split into 14 regional corporations and municipalities, consisting of nine regions and five municipalities, which have a limited level of autonomy. The various councils are made up of a mixture of elected and appointed members. Elections are held every three years. The country was formerly divided into counties.  Political culture  The two main parties are the People's National Movement (PNM) and the United National Congress (UNC); another recent party was the Congress of the People (COP). Support for these parties appears to fall along ethnic lines, with the PNM consistently obtaining a majority of Afro-Trinidadian vote, and the UNC gaining a majority of Indo-Trinidadian support.  Military  Coast Guard vessel in action The Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force (TTDF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of the twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It consists of the Regiment, the Coast Guard, the Air Guard and the Defence Force Reserves. Established in 1962 after Trinidad and Tobago's independence from the United Kingdom, the TTDF is one of the largest military forces in the Anglophone Caribbean. Its mission statement is to \\"defend the sovereign good of The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, contribute to the development of the national community and support the State in the fulfillment of its national and international objectives\\". The Defence Force has been engaged in domestic incidents, such as the 1990 Coup Attempt, and international missions, such as the United Nations Mission in Haiti between 1993 and 1996. In 2019, Trinidad and Tobago signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  Foreign relations  Trinidad and Tobago maintains close relations with its Caribbean neighbours and major North American and European trading partners. As the most industrialised and second- largest country in the Anglophone Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago has taken a leading role in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and strongly supports CARICOM economic integration efforts. It also is active in the Summit of the Americas process and supports the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, lobbying other nations for seating the Secretariat in Port of Spain. As a member of CARICOM, Trinidad and Tobago strongly backed efforts by the United States to bring political stability to Haiti, contributing personnel to the Multinational Force in 1994. After its 1962 independence, Trinidad and Tobago joined the United Nations and Commonwealth of Nations. In 1967 it became the first Commonwealth country to join the Organization of American States (OAS). In 1995 Trinidad played host to the inaugural meeting of the Association of Caribbean States and has become the seat of this 35-member grouping, which seeks to further economic progress and integration among its states. In international forums, Trinidad and Tobago has defined itself as having an independent voting record, but often supports US and EU positions. Law enforcement and crime Trinidad and Tobago has in recent decades suffered from a relatively high crime rate; there are currently roughly 500 murders per year. The country is a noted transshipment centre for the trafficking of illegal drugs from South America to the rest of the Caribbean and beyond to North America. Some estimates put the size of the 'hidden economy' as high as 20‚Äì30% of measured GDP. =Terrorism= Though there have been no terrorism-related incidents in the country since the 1990 Islamic coup attempt, Trinidad and Tobago remains a potential target; for example, in February 2018 a plan to attack the Carnival was foiled by police. It is estimated that roughly 100 citizens of the country have traveled to the Middle East to fight for Islamic State. In 2017 the government adopted a counter- terrorism and extremism strategy. = Trinidad and Tobago Prison Service = The country's prison administration is the Trinidad and Tobago Prison Service (TTPS), it is under the control of the Commissioner of Prisons Gerard Wilson, located in Port-of-Spain. The prison population rate is 292 people per 100,000. The total prison population, including pre-trial detainees and remand prisoners, is 3,999 prisoners. The population rate of pre-trial detainees and remand prisoners is 174 per 100,000 of the national population (59.7% of the prison population). In 2018, the female prison population rate is 8.5 per 100,000 of the national population (2.9% of the prison population). Prisoners that are minors makes up 1.9% of the prison population and foreigners prisoners make 0.8% of the prison population. The occupancy level of Trinidad and Tobago's prison system is at 81.8% capacity. Trinidad and Tobago has nine prison establishments; Golden Grove Prison, Maximum Security Prison, Port of Spain Prison, Eastern Correctional Rehabilitation Centre, Remand Prison, Tobago Convict Prison, Carrera Convict Island Prison, Women's Prison and Youth Training and Rehabilitation Centre. Trinidad and Tobago also use labor yards as prisons, or means of punishment. Demographics The population of the country currently stands at 1,363,985 (July 2019 est.). Ethnic groups The ethnic composition of Trinidad and Tobago reflects a history of conquest and immigration.\\"Trouble in paradise\\". BBC News. (1 May 2002). While the earliest inhabitants were of Amerindian heritage, the two dominant groups in the country are now those of South Asian and of African heritage. Indo- Trinidadian and Tobagonians make up the country's largest ethnic group (approximately 35.4%); they are primarily the descendants of indentured workers from South Asia (mostly from India), brought to replace freed African slaves who refused to continue working on the sugar plantations. Through cultural preservation many residents of Indian descent continue to maintain traditions from their ancestral homeland. Indo-Trinidadians reside primarily on Trinidad; as of the 2011 census only 2.5% of Tobago's population was of Indian descent. Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians make up the country's second largest ethnic group, with approximately 34.2% of the population identifying as being of African descent. The majority of people of an African background are the descendants of slaves forcibly transported to the islands from as early as the 16th century. This group constitute the majority on Tobago, at 85.2%. The bulk of the rest of the population are those who identify as being of mixed heritage. There are also small but significant minorities of people of Amerindian, European, Chinese, and Arab descent. Arima on Trinidad is a noted centre of Amerindian culture. LanguagesEnglish and English creoles= English is the country's official language (the local variety of standard English is Trinidadian and Tobagonian English or more properly, Trinidad and Tobago Standard English, abbreviated as \\"TTSE\\"), but the main spoken language is either of two English-based creole languages (Trinidadian Creole or Tobagonian Creole), which reflects the Amerindian, European, African, and Asian heritage of the nation. Both creoles contain elements from a variety of African languages; Trinidadian English Creole, however, is also influenced by French and French Creole (Patois).Jo-Anne Sharon Ferreira. THE SOCIOLINGUISTIC SITUATION OF TRINIDAD & TOBAGO. University of the West Indies. unb.br =Hindustani= The variant of Caribbean Hindustani that is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago is known as Trinidadian Hindustani, Trinidadian Bhojpuri, Plantation Hindustani, or Gaon ke Bolee (Village Speech). A majority of the early Indian immigrants spoke Bhojpuri and Awadhi, which later formed into Trinidadian Hindustani. In 1935, Indian movies began showing to audiences in Trinidad. Most of the Indian movies were in the Standard Hindustani (Hindi- Urdu) dialect and this modified Trinidadian Hindustani slightly by adding Standard Hindi and Urdu phrases and vocabulary to Trinidadian Hindustani. Indian movies also revitalized Hindustani among Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians. Around the mid to late 1970s the lingua franca of Indo- Trinidadian and Tobagonians switched from Trinidadian Hindustani to a sort of Hindinized version of English. Today Hindustani survives on through Indo- Trinidadian and Tobagonian musical forms such as, Bhajan, Indian classical music, Indian folk music, Filmi, Pichakaree, Chutney, Chutney soca, and Chutney parang. As of 2003, there are about 15,633 Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians who speak Trinidadian Hindustani and as of 2011, there are 10,000 who speak Standard Hindi. Many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians today speak a type of Hinglish that consist of Trinidadian and Tobagonian English that is heavily laced with Trinidadian Hindustani vocabulary and phrases and many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians can recite phrases or prayers in Hindustani today. There are many places in Trinidad and Tobago that have names of Hindustani origin. Some phrases and vocabulary have even made its way into the mainstream English and English Creole dialect of the country. World Hindi Day is celebrated each year with events organized by the National Council of Indian Culture, Hindi Nidhi Foundation, Indian High Commission, Mahatma Gandhi Institute, and the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha. Attempts to preserve Trinidadian Hindustani are being made by Caribbean Hindustani Inc. led by Dr. Visham Bhimull. =Spanish=Tamil= The Tamil language is spoken by some of the older Tamil (Madrasi) Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian population. It is mostly spoken by the few remaining children of indentured Indian laborers from the present-day state of Tamil Nadu in India. Other speakers of the language are recent immigrants from Tamil Nadu. =Chinese= The Chinese language first came to Trinidad and Tobago in 1806, when the British had brought Chinese labourers in order to determine if they were fit to use as labourers after the abolition of slavery. About 2,645 Chinese immigrants arrived in Trinidad as indentured labour between 1853 and 1866. A majority of the people who immigrated in the 19th century were from southern China and spoke the Hakka and Yue dialects of Chinese. In the 20th century after the years of indentureship up to the present-day more Chinese people have immigrated to Trinidad and Tobago for business and they speak the dialects of the indenturees along with other Chinese dialects, such as Mandarin and Min. J. Dyer Ball, writing in 1906, says: \\"In Trinidad there were, about twenty years ago, 4,000 or 5,000 Chinese, but they have decreased to probably about 2,000 or 3,000, [2,200 in 1900]. They used to work in sugar plantations, but are now principally shopkeepers, as well as general merchants, miners and railway builders, etc.\\"Things Chinese or Notes Connected with China. J. Dyer Ball. Fourth Edition Revised and enlarged. Charles Scribner's sons, New York, 1906, p. 144. =Indigenous languages= The indigenous languages were Yao on Trinidad and Karina on Tobago, both Cariban, and Shebaya on Trinidad, which was Arawakan. Religion The 26-meter Hanuman murti in Carapichaima, a noted centre of Hindu and Indo-Trinidadian culture; it is the largest statue of Hanuman outside of India According to the 2011 census, Roman Catholics were the largest single religious group in Trinidad and Tobago with 21.60% of the total population. The Pentecostal/Evangelical/Full Gospel denominations were the third largest group with 12.02% of the population. The remaining population is made of various Christian denominations (Spiritual Shouter Baptists (5.67%), Anglicans (5.67%), Seventh-day Adventists (4.09%), Presbyterians or Congregationalists (2.49%), Jehovah's Witnesses (1.47%), other Baptists (1.21%), Methodists (0.65%) and the Moravian Church (0.27%)). Respondents who did not state a religious affiliation represented 11.1% of the population, with 2.18% declaring themselves Irreligious. Hindus were the second largest group with 18.15%. Hinduism is practiced throughout the country and Diwali is a public holiday, and other Hindu holidays are also widely celebrated. Muslims represent 4.97% of the population. Eid al-Fitr is a public holiday and Eid al-Adha, Mawlid, Hosay, and other Muslim holidays are also celebrated. There has also been a Jewish community on the islands for many centuries, however their numbers have never been large, with a 2007 estimating putting the Jewish population at 55 individuals. African-derived or Afrocentric religions are also practised, notably Trinidad Orisha (Yoruba) believers (0.9%) and Rastafarians (0.27%). Various aspects of traditional obeah beliefs are still commonly practised on the islands. Two African syncretic faiths, the Shouter or Spiritual Baptists and the Orisha faith (formerly called Shangos, a less than complimentary term) are among the fastest growing religious groups. Similarly, there is a noticeable increase in numbers of Evangelical Protestant and Fundamentalist churches usually lumped as \\"Pentecostal\\" by most Trinidadians, although this designation is often inaccurate. Sikhism, Jainism, Bah√° º√≠, and Buddhism are practised by a minority of Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians. Several eastern religions such as Buddhism and Chinese folk religions such as Taoism and Confucianism are followed by a minority of Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian. Urban centresEducation Children generally start pre-school at two and a half years but this is not mandatory. They are however, expected to have basic reading and writing skills when they commence primary school. Students proceed to a primary school at the age of five years. Seven years are spent in primary school. The seven classes of primary school consists of First Year and Second Year, followed by Standard One through Standard Five. During the final year of primary school, students prepare for and sit the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) which determines the secondary school the child will attend.University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Students attend secondary school for a minimum of five years, leading to the CSEC (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate) examinations, which is the equivalent of the British GCSE O levels. Children with satisfactory grades may opt to continue high school for a further two-year period, leading to the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE), the equivalent of GCE A levels. Both CSEC and CAPE examinations are held by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC). Public Primary and Secondary education is free for all, although private and religious schooling is available for a fee. Tertiary education for tuition costs are provided for via GATE (The Government Assistance for Tuition Expenses), up to the level of the bachelor's degree, at the University of the West Indies (UWI), the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT), the University of the Southern Caribbean (USC), the College of Science, Technology and Applied Arts of Trinidad and Tobago (COSTAATT) and certain other local accredited institutions. Government also currently subsidises some Masters programmes. Both the Government and the private sector also provide financial assistance in the form of academic scholarships to gifted or needy students for study at local, regional or international universities. Women While women account for only 49% of the population, they constitute nearly 55% of the workforce in the country.\\"The Global Gender Gap Report 2013\\" (PDF). World Economic Forum. pp. 12‚Äì13. Economy A proportional representation of Trinidad and Tobago's exports The oil refinery at Pointe-√†-Pierre Trinidad and Tobago is the most developed nation and one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean and is listed in the top 40 (2010 information) of the 70 high-income countries in the world. Its gross national income per capita of US$20,070Planning, Family. (30 September 2015) Trinidad and Tobago  Data. World Bank. Retrieved 5 November 2015. (2014 gross national income at Atlas Method) is one of the highest in the Caribbean. In November 2011, the OECD removed Trinidad and Tobago from its list of developing countries. Trinidad's economy is strongly influenced by the petroleum industry. Tourism and manufacturing are also important to the local economy. Tourism is a growing sector, particular on Tobago, although proportionately it is much less important than in many other Caribbean islands. Agricultural products include citrus and cocoa. It also supplies manufactured goods, notably food, beverages, and cement, to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources. Oil and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of employment. Recent growth has been fuelled by investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminium, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning. The country is also a regional financial centre, and the economy has a growing trade surplus. The expansion of Atlantic LNG over the past six years created the largest single-sustained phase of economic growth in Trinidad and Tobago. The nation is an exporter of LNG and supplied a total of 13.4 billion m3 in 2017. The largest markets for Trinidad and Tobago's LNG exports are Chile and the United States. Trinidad and Tobago has transitioned from an oil- based economy to a natural gas based economy. In 2017, natural gas production totalled 18.5 billion m3, a decrease of 0.4% from 2016 with 18.6 billion m3 of production. Oil production has decreased over the past decade from 7.1 million metric tonnes per year in 2007 to 4.4 million metric tonnes per year in 2017. In December 2005, the Atlantic LNG's fourth production module or \\"train\\" for liquefied natural gas (LNG) began production. Train four has increased Atlantic LNG's overall output capacity by almost 50% and is the largest LNG train in the world at 5.2 million tons/year of LNG. Tourism Pigeon Point beach, Tobago Trinidad and Tobago is far less dependent on tourism than many other Caribbean countries and territories, with the bulk of tourist activity occurring on Tobago. The government has made efforts to boost this sector in recent years. Agriculture Historically agricultural production (for example, sugar and coffee) dominated the economy, however this sector has been in steep decline since the 20th century and now forms just 0.4% of the country's GDP, employing 3.1% of the workforce. Various fruits and vegetables are grown, such as cucumbers, eggplant, cassava, pumpkin, dasheen (taro) and coconut; fishing is still also commonly practised. Economic diversification Trinidad and Tobago, in an effort to undergo economic transformation through diversification, formed InvesTT in 2012 to serve as the country's sole investment promotion agency. This agency is aligned to the Ministry of Trade and Industry and is to be the key agent in growing the country's non-oil and gas sectors significantly and sustainably. Communications infrastructure Trinidad and Tobago has a well developed communications sector. The telecommunications and broadcasting sectors generated an estimated TT$5.63 billion (US$0.88 billion) in 2014, which as a percentage of GDP equates to 3.1 percent. This represented a 1.9 percent increase in total revenues generated by this industry compared to last year. Of total telecommunications and broadcasting revenues, mobile voice services accounted for the majority of revenues with TT$2.20 billion (39.2 percent). This was followed by internet services which contributed TT$1.18 billion or 21.1 percent. The next highest revenue earners for the industry were fixed voice services and paid television services whose contributions totalled TT$0.76 billion and TT$0.70 billion respectively (13.4 percent and 12.4 percent). International voice services was next in line, generating TT$0.27 billion (4.7 percent) in revenues. Free-to Air radio and television services contributed TT$0.18 billion and TT$0.13 billion respectively (3.2 percent and 2.4 percent). Finally, other contributors included \\"other revenues\\" and \\"leased line services\\" with earnings of TT$0.16 billion and TT$0.05 billion respectively, with 2.8 percent and 0.9 percent. Annual Market Report 2014. Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago There are several providers for each segment of the telecommunications market. Fixed Lines Telephone service is provided by Digicel, TSTT (operating as bmobile) and Cable & Wireless Communications operating as FLOW; cellular service is provided by TSTT (operating as bmobile) and Digicel whilst internet service is provided by TSTT, FLOW, Digicel, Green Dot and Lisa Communications.  Creative industries  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has recognised the creative industries as a pathway to economic growth and development. It is one of the newest, most dynamic sectors where creativity, knowledge and intangibles serve as the basic productive resource. In 2015, the Trinidad and Tobago Creative Industries Company Limited (CreativeTT) was established as a state agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry with a mandate to stimulate and facilitate the business development and export activities of the Creative Industries in Trinidad and Tobago to generate national wealth, and, as such, the company is responsible for the strategic and business development of the three (3) niche areas and sub sectors currently under its purview ‚Äì Music, Film and Fashion. MusicTT, FilmTT and FashionTT are the subsidiaries established to fulfil this mandate. Transport An intersection of Churchill‚ÄìRoosevelt Highway and Uriah Butler Highway, 2009 The transport system in Trinidad and Tobago consists of a dense network of highways and roads across both major islands, ferries connecting Port of Spain with Scarborough and San Fernando, and international airports on both islands. The Uriah Butler Highway, Churchill Roosevelt Highway and the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway links the island of Trinidad together, whereas the Claude Noel Highway is the only major highway in Tobago. Public transportation options on land are public buses, private taxis and minibuses. By sea, the options are inter- island ferries and inter-city water taxis. The island of Trinidad is served by Piarco International Airport located in Piarco, which opened on 8 January 1931. Elevated at above sea level it comprises an area of and has a runway of . The airport consists of two terminals, the North Terminal and the South Terminal. The older South Terminal underwent renovations in 2009 for use as a VIP entrance point during the 5th Summit of the Americas. The North Terminal was completed in 2001, and consists of 14-second-level aircraft gates with jetways for international flights, two ground-level domestic gates and 82 ticket counter positions. The state-owned Caribbean Airlines is the largest in the region. In 2008 the passenger throughput at Piarco International Airport was approximately 2.6 million. It is the seventh busiest airport in the Caribbean and the third busiest in the English-speaking Caribbean, after Sangster International Airport and Lynden Pindling International Airport. Caribbean Airlines, the national airline, operates its main hub at the Piarco International Airport and services the Caribbean, the United States, Canada and South America. The airline is wholly owned by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. After an additional cash injection of US$50 million, the Trinidad and Tobago government acquired the Jamaican airline Air Jamaica on 1 May 2010, with a 6‚Äì12-month transition period to follow.Daraine Luton, Caribbean Airlines to re-hire 1,000 workers. The Jamaica Gleaner, (29 April 2010). Retrieved 30 May 2012. The Island of Tobago is served by the A.N.R. Robinson International Airport in Crown Point. This airport has regular services to North America and Europe. There are regular flights between the two islands, with fares being heavily subsidised by the Government. Trinidad was formerly home to a railway network, however this was closed down in 1968. There have been talks to build a new railway on the islands, though nothing yet has come of this. Science and technology= Regional policy framework  Strategic Plan for 2015‚Äì2019 = The Strategic Plan for the Caribbean Community 2015‚Äì2019 was adopted by Trinidad and Tobago and the other members of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) in 2014. The first of its kind, this document reflects a desire among countries to embrace a more profound regionalism, in order to reposition the Caribbean in an increasingly volatile global economy. The plan proposes mobilising funding from the public and private sectors to foster research and development (R&D;) in the business sector. The plan outlines strategies for nurturing creativity, entrepreneurship, digital literacy and for making optimum use of available resources. It focuses on developing creative, manufacturing and service industries, with a special focus on tourism initially, natural resources and value-added products, agriculture and fisheries, to reduce dependence on food imports and foster sustainable fisheries, and energy efficiency. = Energy policy = Trinidad and Tobago is the region's leading exporter of oil and gas but imports of fossil fuels provided over 90% of the energy consumed by its CARICOM neighbours in 2008. This vulnerability led CARICOM to develop an Energy Policy which was approved in 2013. This policy is accompanied by the CARICOM Sustainable Energy Roadmap and Strategy (C-SERMS). Under the policy, renewable energy sources are to contribute 20% of the total electricity generation mix in member states by 2017, 28% by 2022 and 47% by 2027.  emissions In 2014 Trinidad and Tobago was the third country in the world which emitted the most per capita after Qatar and Curacao according to the World Bank. On average, each inhabitant produced 34.2 metric tons of in the atmosphere. In comparison, the world average was 5.0 tons per capita the same year. = Climate change strategy = The Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC) has produced an implementation plan for 2011‚Äì2021 and carried out work to assess and build capacity in climate change mitigation and resilient development strategies. This work has been supported by the region's specialists, who have produced models for climate change and mitigation processes in Caribbean states. They also play a major advisor role to the divisions in ministries responsible for climate change. The growing frequency and intensity of hurricanes is of concern to all Caribbean nations. In 2012, Trinidad and Tobago had a 9% chance each year of being struck by a hurricane, according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund.  National policy framework  The two main bodies responsible for science, technology and innovation in Trinidad and Tobago are the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education and the National Commission for Science and Technology. In 2002, Trinidad and Tobago adopted Vision 2020. Like Jamaica's Vision 2030 (2009) and the Strategic Plan of Barbados for 2005‚Äì2025, Trinidad and Tobago's Vision 2020 accords central importance to harnessing science, technology and innovation (STI) to raise living standards and strengthen resilience to environmental shocks like hurricanes.  Research expenditure  Trinidad and Tobago is one of the more affluent members of CARICOM, thanks to its natural resources. Despite this, it spent just 0.05% of GDP on R&D; in 2012, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Even when the country was enjoying economic growth of 8% per annum in 2004, it devoted just 0.11% of GDP to R&D.; Calculated in thousands of current Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) dollars, research expenditure actually dropped between 2009 and 2012 from 21 309 to 19 232. This corresponds to research expenditure of $PPP 65 per capita in 2009 and $PPP 45 in 2012. Industrial R&D; has declined since 2000, perhaps owing to the drop in research activity in the sugar sector. Whereas industrial R&D; accounted for 24% of domestic research expenditure in 2004 and 29.5% in 2005, it had become almost non-existent by 2010.  Researchers  The number of researchers in Trinidad and Tobago grew from 787 to 914 between 2009 and 2012. This corresponds in a rise from 595 to 683 in the number of researchers (head counts) per million inhabitants.  Scientific output  Scientific output grew between 2007 and 2011, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) before contracting over the period 2012‚Äì2014. Trinidad and Tobago produced 109 publications per million population in 2014, behind Grenada (1,430), St Kitts and Nevis (730), Barbados (182) and Dominica (138) but ahead of the Bahamas (86), Belize (47) and Jamaica (42). Between 2008 and 2014, scientists collaborated most with their peers from the United States (251 papers), United Kingdom (183), Canada (95), India (63) and Jamaica (43), according to the copublication record of Thomson Reuters. In turn, Jamaican scientists considered their counterparts from Trinidad and Tobago to be their fourth-closest collaborators (with 43 joint papers) after those from the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Between 2008 and 2013, Trinidad and Tobago registered 17 patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This corresponds to 13% of the 134 patents registered by CARICOM members over this period. The top contributors were the Bahamas (34 patents) and Jamaica (22). Trinidad and Tobago led CARICOM members for the value of high-tech exports in 2008 (US$36.2 million) but these exports plummeted to US$3.5 million the following year, according to the Comtrade database of the United Nations Statistics Division.  Research institutions  The Caribbean Industrial Research Institute in Trinidad and Tobago facilitates climate change research and provides industrial support for R&D; related to food security. It also carries out equipment testing and calibration for major industries. The Caribbean Epidemiology Centre in Port of Spain, University of Trinidad and Tobago, Tobago Institute of Health, and University of the West Indies (St Augustine campus) also conduct R&D.; Probability of a hurricane striking Caribbean countries in a given year, 2012.svgProbability of a hurricane striking Caribbean countries in a given year, 2012 (%)., Figure 6.3, Source: IMF (2013) Caribbean Small States: Challenges of High Debt and Low Growth.

Background  Bright formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1993 initially as a recording project, with Mark Dwinell (guitar, vocals) and Joe LaBrecque (drums) creating songs with minimal vocals, extensive Krautrock-influenced improvisation and repeating measures. Initial raw sessions were documented at the Albatross Guest House on a 4-track recording machine and were later overdubbed. A cassette tape culled from these recordings initially released on Eek records made its way into the hands of Ben Goldberg at Ba Da Bing! records. To fill out the group and facilitate live performance Bright brought more musicians into the fold ‚Äì Jay Dubois (bass) and Paul LaBrecque (guitar, trumpet) In 1996, they released their eponymous self-titled debut on Ba Da Bing! records with veteran studio engineer Jacques Cohen (Mercury Rev, Silver Apples, Jerkwater) recording. In 1997, The Albatross Guest House 4 track sessions was released and Bright reverted to a duo by the following year. During that time, the group recorded the mostly instrumental Blue Christian for Darla Records Bliss Out series. Parting ways with Jay and Paul, Bright recorded Full Negative (or) Breaks in 1999. In 2000, the band now included Michael Torres (electric guitar, nylon string guitar, violin) and Mike Cory (bass guitar) and covered Captain Beefheart's Korn Ring Finger for a tribute album to frontman Don Van Vliet and his Magic Band. At the close of 2001, Bright went on hiatus; Mark Dwinell recorded his solo debut NONLOC in 2002 (including various back-up by Torres) . In 2003, Bright began performing again sporadically, at times a six piece with all former members performing, and also picking up Nate Longcope before heading back to the studio in 2004 to record Bells Break Their Towers, released by Strange Attractors Audio House in 2005. After Bright dissolved, Mark Dwinell relocated from Boston to New York City and went on to found the synth trio Forma. They released their debut album on Spectrum Spools in 2011 and remain active as of 2016.

Alex Cox had tried to make a Mars Attacks film in the 1980s before Burton and Gems began development in 1993. When Gems turned in his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in an attempt to lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The filmmakers hired Industrial Light & Magic to create the Martians using computer animation after their previous plan to use stop motion animation, supervised by Barry Purves, fell through because of budget limitations. Mars Attacks! was released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on December 13, 1996 and received mixed reviews from critics. The film is now considered a cult film. The film grossed approximately $101 million in box office totals, which was seen as a disappointment. Mars Attacks! was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and earned multiple nominations at the Saturn Awards. Plot A spaceship is seen departing from Earth and returning to Mars, where it gathers hundreds of other Martian ships and heads back to Earth. U.S. President James Dale (Nicholson), along with his aides, addresses the United States concerning the historic event. Several days later, the President's science aides set up a first contact meeting with the Martians in Pahrump, Nevada, as Dale watches the development on television with his wife Marsha (Close) and his daughter Taffy (Portman). Using a translation machine, the Ambassador of Mars announces that they \\"come in peace\\". When a hippy releases a dove as a symbol of peace, the Ambassador shoots it before he and the other Martians massacre most of the people at the event, including General Casey (Winfield), news reporter Jason Stone (Fox), and young private Billy-Glenn Norris (Black), before capturing chat-show host and Stone's co-worker and girlfriend Nathalie Lake (Parker) and her pet chihuahua, Poppy. Thinking that the Martians assumed that the dove was a symbol of war, Dale tells Professor Donald Kessler (Brosnan) to renegotiate with the Martians, whose ambassador later requests to address the U.S. Congress. At this meeting, the Martians massacre most of Congress. Kessler begs the Martian ambassador to stop, but is knocked unconscious and taken aboard their ship, where he is later shown with his body dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated. General Decker tries to convince Dale to retaliate with nuclear warfare, but he refuses. After a failed attempt to assassinate Dale in which a disguised Martian is killed, the Martians invade Earth in droves, starting with Washington, D.C. and quickly spreading around the globe. As they attack the White House, the U.S. Secret Service evacuates Dale, but Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier and Taffy is separated from them during the chaos. After the President of France is assassinated by the Martians that night, the U.S. government attempts a nuclear attack on the Martian mothership, but that proves futile and the Martians continue destroying Earth and start defacing and vandalizing world landmarks. Eventually, the Martian leader and two other Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and reduce Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plead for peace and his life. The Martian leader appears to be moved by the speech and seemingly agrees to a truce with Dale, but then uses a gadget disguised as a hand to kill him. As the Martians ravage Las Vegas, Byron Williams (Brown), a former world champion boxer turned casino employee, leads a small group of survivors consisting of Barbara Land, Tom Jones, Byron's co-worker waitress Cindy, and a rude gambling lawyer (DeVito) to an airfield in the hope of flying a small jet to safety. They barely make it there, losing the lawyer in the process (who was killed by a Martian), but discover a large group of Martians (along with the ambassador) stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed by the other Martians, but Tom, Barbara and Cindy manage to escape. While going to rescue his grandmother, Florence, Billy- Glenn's brother Richie (Haas) discovers that the Martians' heads explode when they hear Slim Whitman's \\"Indian Love Call\\". Richie and Florence then drive around town, using the song to kill Martians, and broadcast the song on a local radio station. Thereafter, armed forces broadcast the song around the globe, killing the Martian leader and most, if not all, of the other Martians. Nathalie and Kessler's disembodied heads kiss while the Martian spaceship they are on crashes into the ocean, killing both of them. In the aftermath, Barbara, Cindy, and Jones emerge from a cave with some wild animals to see dozens of crashed Martian ships in Lake Tahoe. Taffy awards Richie and Florence the Medal of Honor. Byron, who survived the Martian brawl, arrives in Washington, D.C. to reunite with his former wife Louise and their two sons Cedric and Neville as the devastation is being cleaned up. CastProduction=Development In 1985, Alex Cox pitched the idea of a film based on the Mars Attacks trading card series as a joint-production to Orion and Tristar Pictures. He wrote three drafts over the next four years, but was replaced by Martin Amis before Orion and Tristar placed Mars Attacks in turnaround. Jonathan Gems, who had previously written multiple unproduced screenplays for director Tim Burton, came up with his own idea for a Mars Attacks film in 1993. The writer pitched both concepts of Mars Attacks and Dinosaurs Attack! to Burton, who both decided that Dinosaurs Attack! would be too similar to Jurassic Park (1993). Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity to pay homage to the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr., especially Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), It Came from Outer Space (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). Burton set Mars Attacks! up with Warner Bros. and the studio purchased the film rights to the trading card series on his behalf. The original theatrical release date was planned for the summer of 1996. Gems completed his original script in 1994, which was budgeted by Warner Bros. at $260 million. The studio wanted to make the film for no more than $60 million. After turning in numerous drafts in an attempt to lower the budget, Gems was replaced by Ed Wood writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Gems eventually returned to the project, writing a total of 12 drafts of the script. Although he is credited with both the screen story and screenplay of Mars Attacks!, Gems dedicates his novelization of the movie to Burton, who \\"co-wrote the screenplay and didn't ask for a credit\\". Warner Bros. was dubious of the Martian dialogue and wanted Burton to add closed captioning subtitles, but he resisted. Working with Burton, Gems pared the film's 60 leading characters down to 23 and the worldwide destruction planned for the film was isolated to three major cities. Scenes featuring Martians attacking China, the Philippines, Japan, Europe, Africa, India and Russia were deleted from the screenplay. \\"Bear in mind this was way before Independence Day (1996) was written,\\" Gems commented. \\"We had things like Manhattan being destroyed building by building, the White House went and so did the Empire State Building. Warner Bros. figured all this would be too expensive, so we cut most of that out to reduce the cost.\\" Further discussing the differences between Mars Attacks! and Independence Day, Gems stated, \\"Independence Day is more like a movie called Fail-Safe and Mars Attacks is like Dr. Strangelove\\", in that both films had a similar story, but with different tones. Howard Stern claimed that the film's climax, where an attack by Martians was thwarted by playing Slim Whitman songs to them, was originally created by him when he worked at WNBC in 1982, in a sketch named \\"Slim Whitman vs. The Midget Aliens From Mars.\\" As Burton listened to the sketch while being interviewed by Stern, he dismissed it as mere coincidence. Casting The decision to hire an A-list ensemble cast for Mars Attacks! parallels the strategy Irwin Allen used for his disaster films, notably The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974). Jack Nicholson, approached for the role of the President, jokingly remarked that he wanted to play all the roles. Burton agreed to cast Nicholson as both Art Land and President Dale, specifically remembering his positive working relationship with the actor on Batman. Susan Sarandon was originally set to play Barbara Land before Annette Bening was cast. Bening modeled the character after Ann-Margret's performance in Viva Las Vegas (1964). Hugh Grant was the first choice for Professor Donald Kessler, a role which eventually went to Pierce Brosnan. Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton and Stockard Channing were considered for First Lady Marsha Dale, but Glenn Close won the role. In addition to Nicholson, other actors who reunited with Burton on Mars Attacks! include Sylvia Sidney from Beetlejuice (1988), O-Lan Jones from Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Danny DeVito from Batman Returns (1992), continuing Burton's trend of recasting actors several times from his previous works. Filming The originally scheduled start date was mid-August 1995, but filming was delayed until February 26, 1996. Director Tim Burton hired Peter Suschitzky as the cinematographer, because he was a fan of his work in David Cronenberg's films. Production designer Thomas Wynn (A Beautiful Mind, Malcolm X) intended to have the war room pay tribute to Dr. Strangelove (1964). During production, Burton insisted that the art direction, cinematography and costume design of Mars Attacks! incorporate the look of the 1960s trading cards. On designing the Martian (played by Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie Smith) who seduces and kills Jerry Ross (Martin Short), costume designer Colleen Atwood took combined inspiration from the playing cards, Marilyn Monroe, the work of Alberto Vargas and Jane Fonda in Barbarella (1968). Filming for Mars Attacks! ended on June 1, 1996. The film score was composed by Burton's regular composer Danny Elfman, to whom Burton was reconciled after a quarrel that occurred during The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), for which they did not co-operate in producing Ed Wood (1994). Elfman enlisted the help of Oingo Boingo lead guitarist Steve Bartek to help arrange the compositions for the orchestra. Visual effects The Martians were created using computer-generated imagery from ILM. Tim Burton initially intended to use stop motion animation to feature the Martians, viewing it as a homage to the work of Ray Harryhausen, primarily Jason and the Argonauts. Similar to his own Beetlejuice, Burton \\"wanted to make [the special effects] look cheap and purposely fake-looking as possible.\\" He first approached Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, to supervise the stop motion work, but Selick was busy directing James and the Giant Peach, also produced by Burton. Despite the fact that Warner Bros. was skeptical of the escalating budget and had not yet greenlit the film for production, Burton hired Barry Purves to shepherd the stop motion work. Purves created an international team of about 70 animators, who worked on Mars Attacks! for eight months and began compiling test footage in Burbank, California. The department workers studied Gloria Swanson's choreography and movement as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard for inspiration on the Martians' movement. When the budget was projected at $100 million (Warner Bros. wanted it for no more than $75 million), producer Larry J. Franco commissioned a test reel from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the visual effects company he worked with on Jumanji. Burton was persuaded to change his mind to employ computer animation, which brought the final production budget to $80 million. Although Purves was uncredited for his work, stop motion supervisors Ian Mackinnon and Peter Saunders, who would later collaborate with Burton on Corpse Bride, received character design credit. Warner Digital Studios was responsible for the scenes of global destruction, airborne flying saucer sequences, the Martian landing in Nevada and the robot that chases Richie Norris in his pickup truck. Warner Digital also used practical effects, such as building scale models of Big Ben and other landmarks. The destruction of Art Land's hotel was footage of the real life nighttime demolition of the Landmark Hotel and Casino, a building Burton wished to immortalize. Title sequence The movie's opening sequence, which depicts the saucers leaving Mars and flying to Earth, \\"measured some 5,000 frames long and was created almost entirely by computer graphics. While the first shot showing a lone reconnaissance ship leaving earth was handled by ILM, the tour de force sequence‚Äôs remaining 12 shots were all done by Warner Digital...On Mars, irises open over the craters dotting the craggy surface, emitting hundreds of thousands of saucers that assume battle formations and head for Earth.\\"Magid, Ron. ‚ÄúAttack Formation‚Äù in Cinescape, Volume 3, Number 4.

The soundtrack was released on March 4, 1997 by Atlantic Records. Track listing=Reception=Release and box office Warner Bros. spent $20 million on the movie's marketing campaign; together with $80 million spent during production, the final combined budget came to $100 million. A novelization, written by screenwriter Jonathan Gems, was published by Puffin Books in January 1997. The film was released in the United States on December 13, 1996, earning $9.38 million in its opening weekend. Mars Attacks! eventually made $37.77 million in U.S. totals and $63.6 million elsewhere, coming to a worldwide total of $101.37 million. The film was considered a box office bomb in the U.S., but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. \\"It was just a coincidence. Nobody told me about it. I was surprised how close it was,\\" director Tim Burton continued, \\"but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone ‚Äì it was different in everything. It almost seemed like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day.\\" During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film. Critical reaction Mars Attacks! drew mixed responses from critics. Based on 82 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 54% of the reviewers enjoyed the film, with an average score of 5.97/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"Tim Burton's alien invasion spoof faithfully recreates the wooden characters and schlocky story of cheesy '50s sci-fi and Ed Wood movies -- perhaps a little too faithfully for audiences.\\" By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 52/100 from 19 reviews. Roger Ebert observed the homages to the 1950s science fiction B movies. \\"Ed Wood himself could have told us what's wrong with this movie: the makers felt superior to the material. To be funny, even schlock has to believe in itself. Look for Infra- Man (1975) or Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973) and you will find movies that lack stars and big budgets and fancy special effects but are funny and fun in a way that Burton's megaproduction never really understands.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the conventions that Independence Day takes seriously. This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! is not as much fun as it should be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul is not in the humor\\". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said \\"Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended.\\" Richard Schickel, writing in Time magazine, gave a positive review. \\"You have to admire everyone's chutzpah: the breadth of Burton's (and writer Jonathan Gems') movie references, which range from Kurosawa to Kubrick; and above all their refusal to offer us a single likable character. Perhaps they don't create quite enough deeply funny earthlings to go around, but a thoroughly mean-spirited big-budget movie is always a treasurable rarity.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum from the Chicago Reader praised the surreal humor and black comedy, which he found to be in the vein of Dr. Strangelove and Gremlins (1984). He said it was far from clear whether the movie was a satire, although critics were describing it as one. Todd McCarthy of Variety called Mars Attacks! \\"a cult sci-fi comedy miscast as an elaborate, all-star studio extravaganza.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"B\\" on a scale of A+ to F. Awards Mars Attacks! was on the shortlist for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects nomination, but the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose Independence Day, Dragonheart and Twister instead. The film was nominated for seven categories at the Saturn Awards. Danny Elfman won Best Music, while director Tim Burton, writer Jonathan Gems, actor Lukas Haas, costume designer Colleen Atwood and the visual effects department at Industrial Light & Magic received nominations. Mars Attacks! was nominated for both the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film (which went to Independence Day) and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

History Howard Miller Clock Company was founded in 1926, as the Herman Miller Clock Company division of office furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, specializing in chiming wall and mantle clocks. It was spun off in 1937 and renamed, under the leadership of Herman Miller's son Howard C. Miller (1905‚Äì1995). Today, there is no connection between the two companies although their headquarters are across the street from one another. Starting in 1947, the Howard Miller Clock Company produced scores of modern wall clocks and table clocks designed by George Nelson Associates. (At that time, Nelson was Director of Design at Herman Miller Furniture Company.) They also produced Nelson's \\"Bubble Lighting\\" through the late 1970s, selling the business in the early 1980s. (Using the original manufacturing equipment developed by Nelson Associates with Howard Miller, the California furniture company Modernica reintroduced the Bubble Lamps in the 1990s and has been the exclusive manufacturer and worldwide distributor of the lamps since that time). Howard Miller Clock Company also produced other Nelson Associates products; spice cabinets, pull-down wall mounted vanities and desks, a vertical hanging vinyl strip system called \\"Ribbon Wall\\" (which was available in many different variations from 12 inches to 84\\" wide and 12\\" to 144\\" high), a complete line of fireplace tools, and other hanging lighting (Metalites, Net Lights, Bubbles, and Lanterns) A number of Nelson's clocks became icons of the era; the Ball, Spike, Block, Spindle, and others were good sellers and have been reissued by Vitra, as well as most of the Zoo Timers clocks, and a select group of table models. In the 1960s, a line of ceramic wall clocks called \\"Meridian\\" was produced using ceramic wall plates designed in Italy and using the Nelson clock hands. This line, as well as the other Nelson clocks and other pieces, was distributed by Richards Morganthau, Inc. (also known as Raymor). One of the last series of modern clocks were the \\"Swing Timers\\", a group of at least 18 inexpensive all plastic clocks produced in the late 1960s and designed by Arthur Umanoff Associates. Umanoff also designed Plexiglas floor and wall clocks, a series of wood clocks called \\"Natural Classics\\", and \\"Day Timers\\" (plastic wall clocks with day and dates). Nathan George Horwitt designed the \\"Museum Clock\\" in the 1970' (both wall and table model). The final George Nelson Associates series of clocks were the 1984 post-modern \\"Tempo '21 Series\\". The modern Nelson and Umanoff clocks were discontinued and these days, the company has little to no interest in that period of modern design. Originally the company only made mantel clocks. Grandfather clocks did not become a part of the product line until the 1960s. The company began making curio cabinets in 1989. The company acquired the Ridgeway,https://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOWARD+MILLER+ACQUIRES+RIDGEWAY.-a0124787253 Hekman and Woodmark companies. The company began marketing and selling wine and spirits furniture in 2004. The company launched a line of Home Storage Solutions partnering with celebrity Ty Pennington in 2008. The company launched a line of furniture partnering with Pennington in 2009.

The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 240,000 copies in its first week. The album was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in September 2020.  Singles  The lead single from the album, called \\"Fireman\\" was released on October 25, 2005. The song was produced by DVLP and Filthy. While they were recording the song at the time, both DVLP and Filthy first burst into a music scene as the production duo, called Doe Boys. The album's second single, \\"Hustler Musik\\" was released on January 10, 2006. The song was produced by T-Mix and the unknown producer named Batman. The album's third single, \\"Shooter\\" was released on April 9, 2006. The song features guest vocals from an American R&B; singer-songwriter Robin Thicke, who also produced this track. The song also was later included on Thicke's then-upcoming album, titled The Evolution of Robin Thicke (2006).  Critical reception  Upon its release, Tha Carter II received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, with several praising the lyricism and artistic growth demonstrated by Wayne on the album. AllMusic's David Jeffries praised the album's balance of \\"hookless, freestyle-ish tracks\\" and \\"slicker club singles\\", commenting that \\"the well-rounded, risk-taking, but true-to-its-roots album suggests he can weather the highs and lows like a champion.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Ryan Dombal wrote that Tha Carter II \\"transcends [Wayne's] inflated ego\\" and complimented the album's \\"sturdy funk-blues tracks... that offer genuine value\\". David Drake of Stylus Magazine called the album \\"one of the year's best releases\\" and lauded his \\"entire persona, an aura, a rap creation that seems developed and fascinating\\". Despite writing that \\"Wayne's verses need a good polish\\", Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork wrote that the album contains \\"jaw- droppers aplenty\\" and complimented Wayne's growth as a lyricist, stating: IGN writer Jim During gave the album an eight out of ten and commented that Wayne \\"[punishes] the mic with hard-hitting verbal tenacity\\", and wrote that the album shows him \\"at his most focused, and is a strong next step for a relatively young career.\\"IGN review Matt Cibula of PopMatters wrote ambivalently towards that album's production, writing that \\"the producers here are mostly no-namers who do their jobs well but not spectacularly\\", but praised Wayne's \\"amazing\\" words and remarked that \\"Straws really IS the best rapper alive, at least when he tries\\". In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked it the 370th best album of all time.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music- lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/lil-wayne-tha-carter-ii-1062863/ It was one of only 84 albums from the 21st century to be added to the list. Commercial performance Tha Carter II debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 240,000 copies in its first week. This became Wayne's fourth US top-ten debut.

She is married to the film music composer Christian Henson and they live in Edinburgh. Career In addition to solo ventures, Allison's career has concentrated on collaborative efforts, and has seen her work beside Scott Walker, Massive Attack, Paul Weller, Hal David, Arab Strap, Mick Harvey, Pascal Gabriel, Kevin Shields, Pete Doherty, Xenomania and Gary Mounfield. She started her career with Scottish proto- indie-dance outfit One Dove, before she released her debut album, Afterglow, in 1999 to generally positive reviews. A song-oriented pop outing, it was followed by the electro and house music inspired We Are Science in 2002. In 2007, she released Exaltation of Larks. Allison's touring group includes members of The Fall, Tindersticks, The Bad Seeds, Massive Attack, and Tokyo Windbag. Stylistically, her music has been described as \\"trip-hop\\" , and owes a great deal to British electronic music of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Allison released Room Seven and a Half in September 2009. It featured a guest appearance by Pete Doherty on the songs \\"I Wanna Break Your Heart\\" and \\"Portrait of the Sun\\", which he co-wrote. Paul Weller also appeared on \\"Love's Got Me Crazy\\". She contributed vocals to the track \\"Without Discord\\" on the soundtrack to the Channel 4 series Henry 8th: The Mind of a Tyrant, written by Philip Sheppard. Allison was the vocal soloist on the film Triangle, directed by Chris Smith. It opened Frightfest at The London Film Festival in 2009. Allison was also the vocal soloist in the film Black Death, starring Sean Bean, released in May 2010. Allison is the vocal soloist in the film The Devil's Double starring Dominic Cooper, which was due for release in 2011. Part of Allison's recording of \\"Message Personnel\\", a single taken from the Afterglow album, was used in the fourth episode of the sixth series of the sitcom Ideal.

The state park's most notable feature is the ruins of Ha Ha Tonka, an early 20th-century stone mansion that was modeled after European castles of the 16th century. The park also features caves, sinkholes, and bluffs overlooking the lake. It is a prominent example of karst topography, which is geological formation shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock. A portion of the park was designated as the Ha Ha Tonka Karst Natural Area in 1981. History Looking up at the Ha Ha Tonka ruins Construction of the Ha Ha Tonka castle was started in 1905 by Robert McClure Snyder, Sr., a Kansas City businessman who purchased the large property after first visiting there in 1903. Alluding to the natural springs on the property, \\"ha ha tonka\\" was said to mean \\"big laugh\\" or \\"smiling waters.\\" Following Snyder's death in an auto accident in 1906, the castle was completed by his sons Robert, Jr., LeRoy, and Kenneth Snyder in the early 1920s before the Stock Market Crash. The building was used as a summer and weekend home by the Snyder family, who lived in Kansas City. In the late 1930s, it was used as a hotel; however, it was destroyed by fire in 1942. The state purchased the castle and grounds in 1978, adapting them for use as a state park and opening them to the public. The water tower was repaired in 2004, with a new roof installed. Although the castle walls were stabilized in the 1980s, a new survey in 2016 determined that portions of the ruins including its arches were seeing mortar and stone failure with the potential beginning of collapse. Some areas have been closed off from the public. The ruins can be seen from an observation point across from the park office. Activities and amenities The park has 15 miles of hiking trails leading to caves, sinkholes, natural bridges, and the castle. The park also features boating, fishing, and swimming.

He was mainly famous as a composer of motets, and is representative of the generation of composers active in the early to middle 16th century who anticipated the style of Palestrina. Life Jean l'H√©ritier was a native of the diocese of Th√©rouanne, in the Pas-de-Calais, but little is known about his early years. According to a note by an Italian contemporary, L'H√©ritier was a pupil of Josquin des Prez, a relationship which most likely occurred while Josquin was at the French royal court in the years after 1500 (exact years for Josquin's stay there have not been established). In 1506 he went to Ferrara, his first trip to Italy. This was shortly after the death of the renowned Obrecht, who died in Ferrara's plague of 1505. Antoine Brumel, another older and more established French composer, went to Ferrara in late 1505 to take Obrecht's place as choirmaster to Alfonso I d'Este, and it is possible that the young L'H√©ritier was known to Brumel and was recommended to the Este family by him. All the remaining records of L'H√©ritier's life come from Italy, so he may have stayed there. After a stay in Ferrara, Duke Alfonso gave him leave to go back to France, but it is not known if he went; the next record of his life is from Rome, where he was in the employ of Pope Leo X in 1514. In 1521 and 1522 he was maestro di cappella at San Luigi dei Francesi, the French church in Rome. Since much of his music appears in Roman manuscripts of this time, he was probably very active as a composer during these years. In 1522 he left Rome and probably went to Mantua, where he was recorded as a singer in the chapel of the Gonzaga family in May 1525. In July 1525 L'H√©ritier went to Verona, where he worked in some capacity for the Bishop of Verona. During this time he was acquired the patronage of the Cardinal of Auch, Fran√ßois de Clermont, who awarded him at least five benefices, and seems to have retained a connection to him until Clermont's death in 1541. The remainder of L'H√©ritier's life is obscure. He maintained ties with Ferrara, as evidenced by his publications there, and he may have been in Venice or Venetian territories later, since Pietro Gaetano, a singer at Saint Mark's, claimed to have studied with him, and additionally a book of L'H√©ritier's motets was published in Venice in 1555. A note written by the papal legate in Avignon indicated that L'H√©ritier was still alive in 1552. Works and influence L'H√©ritier mainly wrote motets, of which there are records of 48, not all of which survive. Some of them have been attributed to other composers, including Adrian Willaert, Jean Mouton, and Philippe Verdelot. Stylistically they are transitional between the styles of Josquin and Palestrina. The later works contain more evenly spaced imitation, and more equality of voices, and more smoothness of counterpoint than the earlier works. Often L'H√©ritier varied polyphonic with homophonic passages, a technique for achieving variety which was common among many Franco-Flemish composers of the time. Most of the motets are based on standard liturgical material: psalms, devotional hymns, responsories, and so forth. Most are in a single section, with the remainder being in two parts. Occasionally L'H√©ritier wrote for many independent parts: for example, Locutus est Dominus is for nine voices (four to six was the norm). Another motet, Nigra sum (One of three settings of this text), was familiar to Palestrina, who used it as source material for his Missa nigra sum of 1590. Only two secular songs by L'H√©ritier have survived, including one based on an extremely erotic secular poem (Cum rides mihi basium negasti). A four-part setting of the Mass Ordinary also survives. L'H√©ritier was one of the leading figures in disseminating the Franco-Flemish style in Italy in the early 16th century, along with Willaert. Since L'H√©ritier was mainly a composer of sacred music, and worked in Rome, leaving numerous compositions in the Vatican archive, he may have been one of the most influential northern musicians on the development of the later Palestrina style. In addition, since his work appears in numerous manuscripts of the 16th century‚Äîat least 66, as well as 45 printed collections‚Äîand in areas as far apart as Spain, Austria, Bohemia, and Poland, in addition to France and Italy‚Äîhis influence seems to have been considerable. Other L'H√©ritiers There were two other French musicians of the 16th century named L'H√©ritier: Antoine (fl. 1508‚Äì1532) and Isaac (fl. around 1540). The former was also from the Pas-de-Calais and may be related to Jean; he was a singer at the Sainte-Chapelle from 1508, and was in the service of Charles V between 1520 and 1532. No details are known about Isaac's life, nor is it known whether or not the L'H√©ritiers were part of the same family, but Isaac is known to be the composer of at least three chansons which were published by music printer Jacques Moderne in Lyon in 1541.

It is dedicated to the life and works of American songwriter Stephen Foster. It is a contributing property to the Schenley Farms National Historic District, is designated as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historical Landmark, and is a landmark whose significance is designated by a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Historical Marker. It is located along Forbes Avenue in the Oakland neighborhood on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as Pitt. The main structure houses the two theaters that serve as performance spaces for the university's Department of Theatre Arts: the 478-seat Charity Randall Theatre and 151-seat Henry Heymann Theatre. The left wing of the building houses the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum and the Center for American Music which contains the University of Pittsburgh's Stephen Foster Collection and archive that includes manuscripts, copies of over 200 of his musical compositions, examples of recordings, songsters, broadside, programs, books, various memorabilia, and several musical instruments, including one of Foster's pianos. The memorial is also home to the university's Ethelbert Nevin Collection and the Society for American Music. Building Fred Kelly Lobby. Charity Randall Theatre. Foster shrine entrance hallway and Charles Connick stained glass. Interior of the Stephen Foster Shrine The Stephen Foster Memorial, dedicated in 1937, is a steel-framed structure faced with the same Indiana Limestone used for the university's Cathedral of Learning. It is one of two buildings, the other being Heinz Memorial Chapel, designed by its architect, Charles Klauder, to accompany his centerpiece Cathedral of Learning on the gothic revival portion of the university's campus. The W.F. Trimble & Son's Company was contracted to help erect the building on March 2, 1935. It was constructed using of Indiana limestone, 400 tons (360,000 kg) of steel, and of concrete. In 2003, a $3.2 million renovation of the Stephen Foster Memorial, focusing on its theater facilities, was completed by Colker and Tom Wiley of Pittsburgh's WTW Architects. The stone courtyard that is adjacent to the rear of the memorial, and sits between it and the south entrance to the Cathedral of Learning, is dedicated to memorial benefactor Josiah Kirby Lilly and is named in his honor. On the grounds of the memorial, near the Foster Shrine pavilion, sits a sundial on a stone base, currently missing its gnomon, that was dedicated May 1914 to the Pittsburgh Blues of the War of 1812 by the Dolly Madison Chapter, U.S. Daughters of 1812. The sun dial was rededicated there on May 9, 1941. The memorial building houses two theaters and, connected via a hallway, a memorial shrine dedicated to displaying items from the university's Foster Hall Collection. The Stephen Foster Memorial serves as the home for the Society for American Music and the University of Pittsburgh's Center for American's Music which encompasses a research library, archive and museum dedicated to expanding and documenting knowledge of American music and its role in American life. Fred Kelly Lobby The Fred Kelly Lobby, which serves as the lobby/foyer of the Charity Randall Theatre, is entered through the memorial's main Forbes Avenue-facing double red doors and contains two rectangular chandeliers by master metalworker Samuel Yellin of Philadelphia. The lobby also contains Charles Connick stained glass windows depicting Shakespeare (misspelled \\"Shakespere\\") and Beethoven that are dedicated to memorial benefactor Josiah Kirby Lilly. The 2003 renovation of the memorial added new pieces of furniture to the lobby/foyer which including an octagonal upholstered banquette, a ticket and concession stand, as well as a new wrought iron ring wheel chandelier. These three additions were designed by Pittsburgh architect Michael Chirigos whose work was inspired by the memorial's Gothic arches. The banquette's seats enclose arched cabinets showcasing playbills for future productions along with college and career memorabilia associated with Gene Kelly's youngest brother, Fred. Both Kellys were Pitt graduates, and it was Fred who taught Gene and many others to dance. The display's cost was underwritten by Fred Kelly's family as an honor to his achievements as an influential choreographer who later became a pioneering television producer and director. The lobby also commemorates outstanding Pitt Theater alumni who are recipients of Department of Theatre Art's annual Fred Kelly Award. Charity Randall Theatre The main 478-seat traditional proscenium theater, formerly known as the Foster Memorial Theatre, was renamed as the Charity Randall Theatre following a $2 million renovation in 2003. The theater was reconditioned to bring it up to code, update its equipment, and replicate the original conditions of the auditorium's features. These renovations were undertaken with donations from the Charity Randall Foundation which was established in 1977 to remember the sister of Pitt graduate and businessman Robert Randall and to support her interest in the arts after her death in a car accident. The plush, deep red seats, identical to those first installed New York's Radio City Music Hall, were reupholstered and their wrought iron frames and oak arms refinished to their original 1930s condition. The number of seats were reduced from 572 to 478, including the addition of 24 new freestanding balcony seats. Other auditorium improvements include new carpeting and new lighting that highlights the vaulted stone ceiling, as well as a restoration of the original Samuel Yellin designed chandelier. In addition, state-of-the-art sound, lighting, and production equipment was added, as well as a new rigging system, actors' restroom, and various stage improvements. Henry Heymann Theatre The downstairs of the memorial houses the 153-seat Henry Heymann Theatre, featuring a thrust stage with seating on three sides. The theater honors the university's longtime scenic designer, and theater donor, Henry Heymann, who taught scenic design from 1968 until he retired in 1993. The Heymann Theatre was created in 2000 in a space that formerly served as the memorial's social room, which hosted USO dances during World War II. A little-known tunnel also extends from the Heymann Theatre to under the loading dock level of the Cathedral of Learning, connecting the two buildings. During the 2003 renovations to the memorial, the downstairs dressing room area was reconfigured to accommodate three \\"star\\" dressing rooms and men's and women's showers. Another basement room serves as headquarters for the still-active Tuesday Musical Club, which initiated the original idea and drive for the construction of the Stephen Foster Memorial. Foster Shrine The left wing, composed of the pavilion of the Foster Shrine, is entered from the left of the building's foyer, which serves as the lobby of the Charity Randall Theatre, and through an entrance corridor that features Foster artifacts, a Foster bust, and five small casement windows featuring Connick stained glass windows devoted to symbols of Stephen Foster and his songs. Moving along the corridor to the shrine, on the right is the entrance to the Foster Reading Room and library, which is home to much of the Foster collection, including its more fragile contents, that can be examined by appointment. Continuing on, the corridor opens into a 12-sided gothic chamber with lancet windows containing Connick stained glass medallions which illustrate various Foster songs. On display in the Shrine in and around Gothic-arched alcoves are Foster's piano, sheet music, broadsides, recordings, and other personal items and memorabilia. The 2003 renovation left the memorial shrine untouched, except for the addition of an unobtrusive fire suppression systems. History Stephen Foster (1826-1864), the center's namesake The Memorial's double red doors The memorial itself was conceived In 1927 when the Tuesday Musical Club, founded in 1889 by affluent female musicians, and University of Pittsburgh Chancellor John Bowman agreed to collaborate on a performance hall dedicated to Stephen Foster that would house the club's recitals. Bowman donated land adjacent to where the foundation for the Cathedral of Learning was being laid for the memorial. However, little progress on the memorial was made until 1932 when Bowman learned of Josiah Kirby Lilly's Foster Hall Collection. After Lilly pledged more than 10,000 Foster items, fund-raising began in earnest, with almost half the $550,000 cost coming from Lilly and his son, Eli. Construction began January 13, 1935, the 71st anniversary of Foster's death. A dedication ceremony took place on June 2, 1937, Pitt's 150th anniversary. The Foster Hall Collection itself was established in 1930 by Josiah Kirby Lilly, noted for being the president of the prominent Indianapolis pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company. The collection originally began as a retirement hobby based upon his lifelong love of Stephen Foster' s music, but it eventually grew into one of the major collections of American music and history. Lilly and his staff, with the help of some of Foster's relatives, as well as through contributions prompted by the publication of the Foster Hall Bulletin, accumulated over 10,000 Foster items. This initial collection was housed in Indianapolis in a small limestone building he called \\"Foster Hall.\\" Before his effort began, there had been no exact knowledge concerning the total number of Foster's works, nor any accurate literature published about the composer. Foster Hall's staff identified 201 original works, and Foster Hall became a resource center for John Tasker Howard's biography Stephen Foster: America's Troubadour (1934). Concerned about the future of his collection, Lilly donated the Foster Hall's holdings to the University of Pittsburgh's new Stephen Foster Memorial and the collection was moved to its new home in 1937. Since then, some additional 20,000 items reflecting Foster, composers influenced by him, and music in American life have been added. The university's Center for American Music also houses the Ethelbert Nevin Collection, which was previously housed in the Theodore M. Finny Music Library until 1999. The Nevin Collection was acquired by the University of Pittsburgh between 1933 and 1956. The materials in the collection were either purchased or donated by Mrs. Ethelbert Nevin, other family members, and friends. The collection consists of original manuscripts, letters, mementos, furnishings, printed matter, and special gifts. Aside from maintaining the collections and museum, The Center for American Music's projects include Voices Across Time, a curriculum support package that allows teachers to integrate historic American Music into their classrooms. The Center also has undertaken Resources of American History II that will provide global online access to music scores, papers, sound recordings, and other American music-related materials in its archives.

It was the 26th tropical or subtropical storm to form in the 2005 season. Tropical Storm Delta, like most late-season storms, developed out of an extratropical low. The storm gradually gained tropical characteristics and was briefly a subtropical storm on November 22\\\\. Delta moved erratically for a few days before moving towards the Canary Islands. It became extratropical just before it passed to the north of the archipelago.  Meteorological history  On November 19, a broad area of eastward-moving low pressure formed in the central Atlantic Ocean about 1400 miles (2200 km) southwest of the Azores. It moved steadily eastward through November 20, but on November 21, under the influence of a cold front to its north, the low turned northeastward and started to develop central convection. On November 22, the non-tropical low pressure system began to gain some tropical characteristics, and its northward motion slowed to a stop. Late that afternoon, the low transitioned into a subtropical storm while stalled about 800 mi (1,300 km) west-southwest of the Azores. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center considered that the storm had already gained enough tropical characteristics to be classified as a tropical storm, but in post-storm analysis, this was reconsidered. The storm's convection organized around a central core, and the system became a tropical storm on November 23 and received the name Delta. An eye-like feature appeared near the storm's circulatory center several times that day. The larger-scale deep-layered cyclonic circulation within which it was embedded steered it on a slow southward and then south-southwesterly track. Strong wind shear prevented immediate development and the system added an eastward component to its drift. Moving out of the high-shear environment on November 24, Delta gained organization. Outflow and convective banding increased and an eye feature became well defined. This eye signaled the storm's peak strength of 70 mph (110 km/h), just below hurricane status. However, the official forecast at the time predicted Delta to strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane. Delta's motion stalled as it reached the southern base of a large cyclonic trough over the northern Atlantic within which it was embedded. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day until, that evening when it began a slow southward drift at 6 mph (9 km/h). Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day Convection broke down in the storm's western semicircle early on November 25; the decreased organization caused slight weakening. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day The southward motion slowed and the weakening trend continued into the evening. Cooling cold tops were counteracted by wind shear which exposed most of the low-level center. The storm's southward motion stopped and it began moving east at 6 mph (9 km/h). Some of the computer models suggested the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west, which a few days later became Hurricane Epsilon. This did not occur, and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast. Tropical Storm Delta approaching the Canary Islands on November 27 As Delta accelerated to the northeast towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November 27\\\\. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted that there was a possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November 28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105 mi (165 km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November 29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.  Preparations and impact  Storm damage from Delta on Tenerife Tropical Storm Delta's arrival in the Canary Islands was described as a \\"historic\\" event. Tropical cyclones there are extremely rare and the islands had no tropical warning systems in place. The government issued a general emergency advisory and advised citizens to stay indoors. Tenerife North Airport was closed, stranding hundreds of passengers for the duration of the storm. The Education Board of the Canary Islands Government suspended Tuesday classes for all non-university schools for 320,000 students. The shipping company Fred Olsen suspended services linking the islands of Tenerife and La Palma and La Gomera. On the island of El Hierro the exposed road to Sabinosa Health Center was closed as a precaution. Delta caused considerable damage in the Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of ‚Ç¨312 million ($364 million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95 mph (152 km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90 mph (147 km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer part of the building when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind. In La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Mar√≠tima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island. Over 225,000 residents lost electricity and 12,000 lost telephone service. Some vandalism and looting was reported during the loss of power, and the police made several arrests during the night. For over 24 hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro, Tenerife and La Palma: the first two due to landslides and the third by the collapse of an old house and a massive tree. One of the most famous geological features of the island of Gran Canaria, El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium, was destroyed by Delta's wind and wave action along Gran Canaria's shore. Upon hearing of the destruction of the natural monument one man, later found to be clinically insane, unsuccessfully tried to kill himself and then stabbed three members of his own family. When the remnants of Delta arrived in Morocco they were described as a \\"normal atmospheric disturbance\\". No damage was reported there and in fact the system was welcomed by farmers who needed the rain to complete the sowing of cereal crops.  Aftermath  With the Canary Islands' power grid substantially disrupted, the Unelco-Endesa power company was forced to use temporary generators to boost power at sub-stations far from the main grid. In La Corujera in Santa √örsula, these generators were poorly received and over 1,000 local residents claimed to be affected by the noise and pollution. Children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely. Roughly ‚Ç¨25 million (US$37.25 million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds. Of this total, ‚Ç¨22.5 million (US$33.5 million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; ‚Ç¨1.5 million (US$2.2 million) was used for agricultural relief; and ‚Ç¨1 million (US$1.5 million) was used in home repairs. Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. A tax break was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta. Fishermen of the Canary Islands had to return to and remain in port for several days while weathering the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10‚Äì15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.  Naming and distinctions  Tropical Storm Delta was the second Atlantic storm to be designated Delta. The first was 1972's Subtropical Storm Delta. The next one to be so named was Hurricane Delta in 2020. Delta's record-setting formation date as the season's 26th tropical or subtropical storm would stand until 2020, when broken by Tropical Storm Epsilon, which formed on October 19.

A popular tourist destination and member of the National Caving Association, it is the largest of all the cave systems in Ohio and contains many crystal formations. Approximately 90% of its stalactite and stalagmite formations are still active. The cavern system was originally an aquifer, holding an underground river of melted glacier water. This river eventually receded to lower levels of the ground and is now unseen. Formation The Ohio Caverns are located in the Bellefontaine Outlier, which is an outcropping of Devonian-age bedrock surrounded by Silurian-age carbonates. Most recently it has been proposed that in post-Devonian times there was a set of active parallel faults that down- dropped a block of Logan County, forming a graben, also called a rift valley. Continued erosion of several glaciers would have been concentrated on areas around the graben, leaving this area without its protective layer of Bedford shale and more susceptible to erosion. The sunken graben area then became a topographical high, now the highest point in Ohio at the elevation of 1549 feet above sea level.Sprowls, K.M. Ground water pollution potential of Logan County, Ohio, Ground Water Pollution Potential Report 36. Columbus: Ohio Department of Natural Resources, 1995, 23-29. History=Discovery The tunnel system known today as the Ohio Caverns was discovered August 17, 1897 by Robert Noffsinger, a farmhand who worked on the land. A sinkhole had been forming on land owned by Abraham William Reams over a period of about 10 years. In August 1897, this sink hole measured 50 feet across by 10 feet deep. One particular night, the sinkhole was filled completely with water during a hard rain. By morning, the water was completely gone. Reams reported to the local newspaper that he lost \\"several hundred barrels of water.\\" Reams had recently hired Robert Noffsinger, a young man from Virginia, to work on his farm. By Reams' orders, Noffsinger and Jordan Reams (unknown relation to William Reams) began to dig in the sinkhole. Noffsinger dug a few feet of soil until he hit the top of the ground's limestone layer. After finding a crack in the limestone, Noffsinger broke through this rock as well. Immediately feeling the caverns' air, Noffsinger was even more curious. He lowered himself into the caverns and became the first living creature inside of the Ohio Caverns system. After crawling 8 feet into the caverns, Noffsinger called back out to Jordan Reams to fetch him an oil lantern. After Noffsinger received the lantern, he explored 802 feet on his first trip into the caverns. Mt. Tabor Cave Tours Noffsinger informed the landowner, a farmer named William Reams, of his discovery. Reams himself explored the cave and then decided to open the cave to the public. The cave was opened to Reams' friends and family on August 27, 1897 and then to the public on September 9, 1897. Advertised under the name Mt. Tabor Cave Tours, the business brought in hundreds of Ohioans during its 25-year run. These early tourists explored just over of the system but virtually destroyed it by removing crystal formations in that area and writing their names on the walls and ceilings. Excavation Reams sold the land in 1922 to two brothers from Dayton, Ohio, Allen and Ira Smith, who hired an unknown number of workers to help them excavate the rest of the caverns. The team spent three and a half years digging with an array of spades and shovels to remove mud left in the tunnels by the underground river that eroded the tunnels. As they went, the Smith team strung 60-watt light bulbs from the walls and ceilings to help them see. These lights were powered by a Fordson tractor on the surface, as the area did not get electricity until the mid-1930s. Four new exits were dug, one of which contained a horse-drawn wooden freight elevator. The group mapped approximately of tunnel and decided on the best route for a one-way tour. They closed one of the exits permanently with a crude rock wall and planted a tree over it. The elevator also was filled in with rocks, and a concrete wall in the cave now seals it shut. Keeping the style of entrance that Reams had used, iron doors were built at the two ends of the new tour route. A small entrance building was built over one end of the route, and 38 steps descend from the ground floor of the building through the basement and into the cave, below the surface. At the other end, a single flight of 60 concrete stairs was built. Reams' iron door and the current exit door have developed holes large enough for bats to enter the cave, and today some little brown bats and eastern pipistrelles take shelter in the cave, primarily in the winter. The Ohio Caverns The excavation team laid gravel in the pathways they had dug. The Smith family opened their business as the Ohio Caverns in 1925 with a guided tour route that did not include the section that Reams' early visitors had explored and ravaged. Entrance building c.1930s The rest of the twentieth century brought several changes for the caverns and park. On the surface, two picnic shelters, a dining hall (which has since been converted to a storage building), a playground, a restroom building, and a steel barn were built. Later, a small exit building was built to increase security at the exit stairwell, and the entrance building was renovated to now include a gift shop and a new basement containing offices and storage. In the cave, concrete was hand-laid on the floors in the 1970s. A professional cave lighter, whose team hid the new lights in concrete sconces in more creative and less obstructive places than the previous bare bulbs, was hired in the 1980s. The Historical Tour To celebrate the 100-year anniversary of Noffsinger's discovery of the cave, the Ohio Caverns opened its Historical Tour in 1997. Reams' section of the cave was adorned with the bare bulbs and gravel floors of the early Ohio Caverns tours. The Historical Section was added as a 45-minute extension to the regular tour, and the Historical Tour has been offered as an option ever since. Attractions=The Crystal Sea and Natural Bridge Crystal Sea and Sunken City The Crystal Sea is an artificial water-retention pool that holds excess water out of the walkway. Only about deep, its name is derived from the reflection of the ceiling visible in the water. The Crystal Sea is very close to the site of the freight elevator used from 1922 to 1925 and is also close to a mud shelf above the pathway called the Natural Bridge, which holds between 10 and 20 crystal columns and is the original floor of the tunnel. The Smiths' team left the columns intact during excavation and simply dug under them, forming the Natural Bridge. Fantasy Land and The Old Town Pump The Old Town Pump Fantasy Land holds more soda straws and helictites than any other area of the Ohio Caverns. It is called Fantasy Land for the many named formations in the room, one of which being The Old Town Pump, which resembles a hand pump. The Crystal King and Deepest Point The Crystal King The Crystal King is the largest free-hanging stalactite in Ohio. At last measurement, the Crystal King was long. It is estimated to weigh over and be over 200,000 years old. It is also noteworthy that the Crystal King and Fantasy Land are farther from the surface than any other point of the cave. The designated Deepest Point is underground. The Big Room and The Good Luck Crystal The Big Room, at more than , is the largest room in the cave and holds hundreds of formations, including the tallest column in the cave, which is almost tall, and the newest column, which came together in the 1980s. The next column that will be formed in the caverns is also in The Big Room, and it is estimated to be formed within the next century. During the early days of the Smiths' tours, touching formations was not prohibited, and there are many formations in the Big Room that are very close to the pathways and have therefore become permanently stained from the dirt and oil in human hands. One such formation, a tall stalagmite once called The Good Luck Crystal, was touched for \\"good luck\\" by almost every person who came through the Ohio Caverns for about a year until the staff noticed the developing brown stain. In 1926, a no-touching rule was established in the caverns. At the same time, the staff renamed The Good Luck Crystal, The Dirty Crystal. The Palace of the Gods and Dual Formations The Palace of the Gods The Palace of the Gods is the most photographed room in the caverns because of its variety of colors and formations. There are examples of every type of formation in the cave: iron oxide formations; manganese dioxide formations; calcite formations: stalactites, stalagmites, columns, flowstone, soda straws, and helictites; and Dual Formations. Dual Formations are extremely rare. The Ohio Caverns is the only known cave in North America and one of very few in the world known to have Dual Formations. A Dual Formation is characterized as being a formation growing on another formation. In the Palace of the Gods, there are calcite stalactites growing on the ends of iron oxide formations. The Jewel Room The Jewel Room once helped earn Ohio Caverns the nickname \\"America's Most Colorful Caverns\\". Its color is split down the middle of the room so that one side of the room is primarily decorated in iron oxide while the other side is darker from manganese dioxide deposits. The Jewel Room was the last area finished by the Smith team and is therefore the end of the tour. There is an enormous pile in the Jewel Room of rocks from the construction of the exit stairway. At the end of each guided tour, a recording of the song Beautiful Ohio has been played since 1928. The Historic Section A tour of the Historic Section, also known as The Old Cave and Reams' Cave, has been offered since 1997 as an extension of the regular tour. Unlike the concrete floors and hidden-sconce lights in the rest of the cave, there are bare light bulbs and gravel floors similar to the early years of Ohio Caverns tours. Attractions in the Historic Section include The Palace of Natural Art, a colorful natural rotunda; The Giant's Coffin, a rock nicknamed so by Reams' early tourists; and The Pulpit, which crudely resembles a church setting and even has an upright- standing rock that resembles a pulpit. Also in the Historic Section are several small crawling areas, including Lovers' Lane and The Backscratcher, which were explored by Reams and his visitors but not excavated by the Smiths' team. The Historic Section has very few speleothems because most of them were taken as souvenirs between 1897 and 1922, so its main commercial appeals are its color and graffiti.

The state park is jointly administered with adjoining Taum Sauk Mountain State Park, and together the two parks cover more than sixteen thousand acres in the St. Francois Mountains region of the Missouri Ozarks. The term \\"shut-in\\" refers to a place where the river's breadth is limited by hard rock that is resistant to erosion. In these shut-ins, the river cascades over and around smooth-worn igneous rock, creating a natural water park that is used by park visitors when water levels are not dangerously high. Geology The bedrock of the area is an erosion resistant rhyolite porphyry and dark colored diabase dikes of Proterozoic age. Waters of the East Fork Black River became confined, or \\"shut-in,\\" to a narrow channel following fractures and joints within the hard igneous rock. Water- borne sand and gravel cut deeply even into this erosion-resistant rock, carving potholes, chutes and canyon-like gorges.Beveridge, T. R., Geologic Wonders and Curiosities of Missouri, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, 2nd ed. 1990, pp 40‚Äì43 History The park was the mid-19th century homestead of the Johnston family, Scotch-Irish immigrants who had moved west from the Appalachian region. When the Johnston family sold the land three generations later, most of it was purchased by Joseph Desloge (1889‚Äì1971), a St. Louis civic leader and conservationist. Desloge assembled most of the park, including the shut-ins and two miles of river frontage, over a period of 17 years, then donated it to the state in 1955. The Desloge lead mining family continued over the years to donate funds for park improvements. 2005 reservoir failure and flood On December 14, 2005, the park was devastated by a catastrophic flood caused by the failure of the Taum Sauk pumped storage plant reservoir atop a neighboring mountain. Damage included eradication of the park's campground, which was unoccupied at the time. The only people at the park were the park's superintendent and his family, who survived, sustaining some injuries. The park was closed because of the extent of the damage it received. The park partly reopened in the summer of 2006 for limited day use, but due to dangerous conditions, swimming in the river and exploring the rock formations was prohibited. In 2009, the river and shut-ins were reopened for water recreation. A new campground opened in 2010. Park restoration and improvements were funded with $52 million of a $180 million settlement to the state from AmerenUE, the owner and operator of the failed reservoir. 2009 derecho Some areas of forest in the park and the surrounding region were severely damaged by the May 2009 derecho windstorm. Straight-line wind speeds in this part of Reynolds County reached with microbursts estimated up to . Activities and amenities Park activities include camping, hiking, swimming, and rock climbing. Park trails include a paved quarter-mile walkway to an observation deck overlooking the shut-ins, the Goggins Mountain Equestrian Trail loop, and a section of the Ozark trail. An extension to the park provides an auto tour that passes by the ongoing recovery effort, as well as the recovered endangered fens area, terminating at a shaded overlook of the flood path accessible from the park entrance. From this one can walk a path through the boulder field created by the flood. The boulder field contains many examples of the minerals and rocks that make up the St. Francois Mountains of the Ozarks.

Donald McGavran, a seminal figure in this movement asserted that \\"It is God's will that women and men become disciples of Jesus Christ and responsible members of Christ's church\\". History The church growth movement began with the publication of Donald McGavran's book The Bridges of God. McGavran was a third-generation Christian missionary to India, where his observations of How Churches Grow (the title of another of his books) went beyond typical theological discussion to discern sociological factors that affected receptivity to the Christian Gospel among non-Christian peoples. In 1965, he organized the School of World Mission at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, which was the institutional homebase for Church Growth studies until after his death. It has been the training ground for tens of thousands of pastors and missionaries of one hundred mainly evangelical denominations. McGavran used statistical research to show that the typical missiological strategy of the time, mission stations, was largely ineffective in reaching people for Christ, as well as ineffective in discipleship. The original goal of the Church Growth Movement was to answer the question, \\"How do we reach peoples (as opposed to a few random individuals) with the gospel in the U.S.?\\". The goal was to understand how to share Christianity in a culturally appropriate way, given the changing climate in the United States. Just as Donald McGavaran stated that we must understand the culture of the people we are trying to reach; we cannot simply enter a completely different culture on the other side of the world, we must seek to understand that culture, and present the gospel in a culturally relevant way. Paul's missionary journeys, it was argued, used the same cultural relevance, which eventually led to the council at Jerusalem (Acts 15) which determined whether Gentile converts must adopt Jewish culture in order to become Christian. Stetzer states that the Church Growth Movement went astray when it became overly simplified into a series of formulas for church growth, and ultimately led to the very thing McGavran sought to avoid, namely a new kind of mission station. Stetzer states too many of the churches following the emerging formulas became a socially engineered mission station, which drew people out of their own cultures, into Christian warehouses and away from their neighborhoods and communities where they lived. Methods Two key attributes of Church Growth are a passion for the \\"Great Commission\\" and a willingness to apply research to attracting members, including quantitative methods. Scholars and leaders from many denominations continue to meet annually to discuss the implications of these insights as the American Society for Church Growth. The \\"seeker sensitive\\" label is associated with some megachurches in the United States where Christian messages are often imparted by means of elaborate creative elements emphasizing secular popular culture, such as popular music styles. Such churches often also develop a wide range of activities to draw in families at different stages in their lives. Four key approaches include: * The \\"Attractive Church Model\\", which was set forth by Rick Warren's book, \\"The Purpose-Driven Church\\". In this model, programs (such as daycare, sports programs, classes, and contemporary music and worship) are created which attract people from the community to the church. * The \\"Missional Church Model\\", which was set forth by Michael Slaughter of Ginghamsburg UMC. In this model, missional activities are developed to which people are drawn to participate. As they participate, they gradually become involved in the life of the church. * The \\"Preach God to Friends and Neighbors Model\\", set forth by Brian L. Boley's book, \\"How to Share the Gospel: A Proven Approach for Ordinary People\\". In this model, members of the congregation begin to preach God to friends and neighbors. As they preach God, they are eventually seen as \\"God-experts\\", and people begin to inquire of them about spiritual issues. * The \\"Soul Winning Model\\" (see the Book of Acts) has always been trumpeted by Bible-believing Christians, but heavily more recently with the announcement of a National Church Growth Conference being held at Clays Mill Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. Host Pastor Jeff Fugate is a keynote speaker in Independent Baptist circles and is well known for his old fashioned stand and his zeal for the bus ministry. Criticism and praise Critics from other Christian groups suggest the movement is \\"only about numbers\\" and \\"success\\" oriented. Willow Creek Community Church recently conducted a major survey that revealed that heavy involvement into programs and activities did not necessarily translate into discipleship unless the church had a clear path for believers' development. In response, Chuck Colson stated, \\"I am cheering Willow Creek on. Think what could happen if, instead of tickling ears, all the churches gave the people real meat.\\" Colson does not outright praise or condemn the church growth movement, instead, he states, \\"During the Reformation, the reformers had a phrase for this spirit. It was called semper reformandi, or always reforming. The more we continue to understand that we have not arrived, and the more willing we are to adopt the humble approach that we and our churches are in need of continual reformation, the more our churches and lives will come to reflect the God we preach.\\" References Literature  * * .

These rifles are produced by PTR Industries, Inc. of Aynor, South Carolina for the law enforcement and civilian markets in the United States. The abbreviation PTR stands for \\"Precision Target Rifle.\\" History The weapon is based on the Heckler & Koch G3 and HK91 design, which itself is a variant of the Spanish-made CETME rifle. The United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban enacted in 1994, by President Bill Clinton, prohibited certain cosmetic features of the HK91, which meant that the HK91 and its variants could no longer be manufactured and sold to the US civilian market in their original configuration. Furthermore, German-made HK91s were specifically prohibited from importation under an import ban enacted by President George H. W. Bush in 1989. Subsequently, Heckler & Koch ceased manufacture of the semi-automatic G3-variant, the HK91. The PTR-91 was developed to fill perceived void in supply as an American variant of the original G3 battle rifle. JLD Enterprises (JLD) purchased prints and tooling from F√°brica de Bra√ßo de Prata, an H&K-licensed;, military factory based in Portugal. JLD then began manufacturing ban-compliant PTR-91 rifles in 2002. These ban-compliant models did not have a threaded barrel, bayonet lugs, adjustable stocks, or \\"high-capacity\\" magazines. Very early models were produced directly from the Portuguese prints and were nearly identical to the HK91 with the exception of modifications for compliance with the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. Once the ban expired in 2004, JLD began offering a wider range of PTR-91 models, many of which featured more of the original military features of the storied G3. JLD also began investing in research and development and debuted new improvements and modifications to the original HK91 design. Initially, JLD-produced rifles relied heavily on imported military surplus components to complete their G3-variant. Most parts between HK-91 and PTR-91 guns were and continue to be interchangeable. In 2005, the major assets of JLD Enterprises were purchased by the newly formed PTR-91 Inc. Mr. Jose Diaz, JLD's founder and owner, stayed on with the new company as a major partner. Mr. Diaz left the company in late 2010. Subsequently, the remaining partners and new management changed the strategic direction of the company. PTR moved from a business model of surplus part importation and assembly to that of a true self-reliant manufacturer, featuring in-house production. The company added significant machining and fabrication capabilities in 2011 and 2012 to accomplish this change. Currently, PTR is capable of producing every machined part on its rifles at its plant, and sources other items, such as the plastic accessories and furniture, locally in the United States on tooling that it owns. As a result, current PTR rifles are made and assembled in the United States. In 2014, PTR relocated to Aynor, South Carolina, and was formally incorporated as PTR Industries, Inc. in South Carolina. Variants The best-known and oldest version of the PTR-91 rifle is the PTR-91F. This rifle, similar to the original HK91, features an 18-inch heavy target barrel and fixed plastic stock. PTR also produces higher-end versions of the rifle, such as the PTR- MSG91, a mid-range rifle featuring an 18-inch fluted heavy target barrel, along with enhancements for precision target shooting such as a bipod, rail system, and adjustable stock. PTR also produced in limited quantities a \\"PTR Super Sniper\\" version, which featured a 20-inch fully fluted, free-floating barrel. In addition, PTR also produces several models of carbine that feature a 16-inch heavy target barrel. These are available with standard hardware as found on the PTR-91F, and include configurations of different stocks, rails, and barrels. A popular model is the PTR-91 KPF, which has an A3-type fully collapsible paratrooper stock. In 2010, the company released a new line of products chambered in 7.62√ó39mm known as the PTR-32 series. The PTR-32s are made exclusively with 16-inch barrels, and are available in the same configurations as the PTR-91 carbines.http://www.ptr91.com Calendar year 2011 saw the launch of another new product, the \\"PTR-GI\\", which is a throwback to the classic Cold War military styling of the original H&K; G3. Also around 2011, PTR-91s began to be available with a welded scope rail, and are identifiable by an \\"R\\" in the model name. In 2015, PTR-91 rifles began to include paddle-magazine release for faster reloading. Reception PTR weapons have been featured in numerous gun magazines, such as Gun Tests, Guns and Weapons for Law Enforcement, American Rifleman, On Target, Shotgun News, and Gun World, all of which praised them for having good accuracy and reliability, characteristic of the weapon it was designed after.

In the autumn of 2009, he played against Australia, in a 6-1 loss, and in a surprisingly successful run at the ICC Champions Trophy, which was held in South Africa, where England beat the hosts and Sri Lanka before being thrashed by 9 wickets against Australia in the semi-finals (in which Wright scored 49, putting on a century partnership with Tim Bresnan). In that match he along with Tim Bresnan set the highest 7th wicket partnership in ICC Champions Trophy history (107) By this point, Wright had established himself in the lower order where his role was to hit quick runs late in the game. Following the Champions Trophy, in October 2009 Wright was called up to England's Test squad for the first time for the winter tour of South Africa. His inclusion was to fill the all-rounder's spot vacated by Andrew Flintoff's retirement after the 2009 Ashes. Geoff Miller, England's chairman of selectors, said \\"The retirement of Andrew Flintoff has created a vacancy for an all-rounder in the squad and while we do not see Luke Wright as a like for like replacement for Andrew, we are excited by the way in which his all-round game continues to develop and believe he can make an impact at Test level\\". Wright was expected to play in the first Test, however England chose to go with 6 batsmen and chose Ian Bell in a match that ended as a draw. Wright was very much a regular of the England one day side, however, and was a member of the England Twenty20 squads for both the 2009 and 2010 tournaments where he was a member of the winning England team.

It is located approximately 100 kilometres south east of the town of Mount Magnet. Setting The Windimurra Igneous Complex is part of the c. 2813 Ma Meeline Suite of mafic- ultramafic layered intrusions of the central Murchison Domain, Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia. It is a conical body, approximately 7 km thick, primarily composed of layered gabbroic rocks, which intrude into c. 2820 Ma Norie Group rocks of the Murchison Supergroup. The intrusion is approximately 85 x 37 km (2500 km2) in extent. Lithology Windimurra contains in excess of 13,000m of intact igneous stratigraphy formed of cumulate layering by a process of fractional crystallization. Individual rock types can be grouped into a troctolite phase or series, a gabbro phase or series and a gabbronorite phase or series. Anorthosite cumulates are preserved in the roof sections, most of which are sheared and faulted off. A marginal granophyre complex exists in the roof and wall rocks, formed by advective heat transfer causing melting of the country rocks. Economic geology The Windimurra Intrusion has been of great interest to mineral exploration companies for decades, as it is one of the thickest and largest ultramafic intrusions in the world, though it has been fragmented and mostly removed by shearing unlike the Bushveld Igneous Complex of South Africa. Exploration has focused on finding basal nickel sulfide and chromitite deposits, although that has proved fruitless as the lower zone is not exposed. However, exploration for vanadium deposits related to oxide cumulate layers higher up in the intrusion has proved successful, with the opening of a major vanadium operation in the 1990s. Vanadium The Shepherd's Discordant Zone is host to a laterally extensive vanadiferous magnetite and ilmenite adcumulate and mesocumulate deposit, forming a resource in excess of 120 Mt grading 5% V2O5. The vanadium mineralisation is approximately 500 m thick and contains a basal 2m thick magnetite zone (containing >70% magnetite) and podiform, lenticular magnetite horizons above it, which is of principal economic interest. In addition a few oxide-rich layers in the upper zone of the intrusion are ilmenite rich, although these appear not to be economic.

He is one of the few survivors of the island of Genosha which was destroyed by the wild Sentinel attacks commissioned by Cassandra Nova. Fictional character biography Very little is known about Freakshow, except that he is one of the few survivors of the island of Genosha after the Sentinel attacks on the capital of Hammer Bay. Somehow he finds himself to be the travelling companion of Wicked and becomes an unofficial pupil of Professor X. He soon proved his usefulness in dispatching a skirmish between the Professor and the local bully Unus the Untouchable. Knowing that he couldn't do anything to harm Unus, Xavier had Freakshow swallow the man whole. Because of Unus' natural force field he was unharmed albeit shaken when Freakshow vomited him up later. He helps his friend Wicked survive an attack by Magistrates, military forces who were once the murderous law-enforcement arm of the Genoshan government. During their efforts to rebuild Genosha, Freakshow takes on a worm-like form and digests the debris of many shattered buildings to turn it into arable land. After the events of the House of M Freakshow is revealed to be one of the many mutants to lose his abilities has a result of the Scarlet Witch's decimation. He has been seen with a number of Genoshan mutants including Unus the Untouchable and Wicked. In Son of M #5, (June 2006) the traveling mutant Quicksilver convinces them to try the mutagenic compound called the Terrigen Mists, which had been stolen from the Inhumans. Freakshow regains his powers, but like the other mutants who have used the mist, it came with a price. For some time, he is unable to change out of his large, monstrous form. While trapped like this, he and the other Genosha mutants are drawn into battle with the Inhumans, who are tracking down Quicksilver. Some time after, the effects of the mist wear off. Powers and abilities Freakshow is a megamorph with the ability to transform his body into a variety of monstrous forms with unique abilities (such as a dragon form capable of flight and fire breathing). While in these forms he has enhanced strength, speed, stamina, and resistance to injury along with the special characteristics of each form. He was also shown to take on humanoid forms, specifically an armored form akin to Colossus and a mythological Nordic Troll. In all of these forms Freakshow was still capable of human speech. Another Freakshow In X-Force vol. 1 #101, a young mutant known as Kevin, nicknamed Freakshow, nearly fell to his death when he attempts to impress others his age by proving that he could fly.

It is now headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Spalding currently focuses on basketball, mainly producing balls but also commercializing hoops, rims, nets and ball pump needles. Softballs are commercialized through its subsidiary Dudley Sports. In the past, Spalding manufactured balls for other sports, such as American football, baseball, soccer, volleyball, and golf.  History Albert Spalding, founder of the company, in 1910 The company was founded in 1876 when Albert Spalding was a pitcher and manager of a baseball team in Chicago, the Chicago White Stockings. The company standardized early baseballs and developed the modern baseball bat with the bulge at its apex. In 1892, Spalding acquired Wright & Ditson and A. J. Reach, both rival sporting goods companies. In 1893, A.G. Spalding & Brothers purchased the Lamb Knitting Machine Company located in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts and renamed it the Lamb Manufacturing Company. It used this purchase to consolidate its skate manufactory from Newark and its gymnasium goods manufactory from Philadelphia to the Chicopee plant. Lamb, primarily engaged in manufacturing knitting machines, rifles, and egg-beaters, had been fulfilling a contract since 1890 to produce the Credenda bicycle wheel for Spalding. Spalding chose Chicopee because it was the home of the Overman Wheel Company, Spalding acted as their distributor in the Western USA, and Overman contracted with Lamb to make wheels for its lower-end products.Springfield Republican, October 10, 1893, p. 6 Wrap cover of Spalding's Athletic Library Baseball: Base Ball, published in 1911.

Sports covered include American football, athletics (track and field, cross country running), badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, canoeing, croquet, fencing, golf, gymnastics, handball, ice hockey, ice skating, lacrosse, polo, roller hockey, soccer, swimming, tennis, wrestling. Some of the rules published included NCAA Rules and Guides, and the Official Rules of the AAU. Production of bicycles continued at the Chicopee plant through the latter part of the 19th century, but in 1899 A.G. Ben Spalding sold its bicycle division to a massive trust called the American Bicycle Company which controlled 65% of the bicycle business in the US.Springfield Republican, September 3, 2008, written by Stephen Jendrysik During World War II, the company joined five other firms to form the New England Small Arms Corporation for manufacture of M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles. From the early 1930s through the mid-1940s, Spalding produced the official game pucks for the National Hockey League. Spalding produced the well-known \\"Spaldeen\\" high-bounce rubber ball, said to be a re- use of defective tennis ball cores, that was sold to city children from 1949. In baseball, Spalding manufactured the official ball of the major leagues through the 1976 season, using the Reach brand on American League balls and the Spalding trademark on National League balls. Since 1977 the official ball has been made by Rawlings. Spalding became a division of the Russell Corporation in 2003. However, that deal did not encompass Spalding's golf operations, which included the Top-Flite, Ben Hogan and Strata brands, which were eventually bought by Callaway later the same year.

History Anna Margaretta Heinz Henry J. Heinz The chapel was a gift of German-American Henry John Heinz, founder of the H.J. Heinz Company, who wanted to honor his mother, Anna Margaretta Heinz, with a building at the university. Upon his death in 1919, Heinz's three surviving children (Howard, Irene, and Clifford) added to his bequest in order to memorialize their grandmother and honor their father. Their choice of a chapel for a memorial was guided by the concepts of education and religion which Anna Margaretta Heinz imbued in her children. Howard Heinz, Chancellor John Gabbert Bowman, and Joh Weber, business manager and university secretary, were the driving energy behind the chapel's concept and execution. Working with them were other members of the Heinz family, and two well-known clergymen, Dr. Hugh Thomson Kerr, pastor of Shadyside Presbyterian Church, and Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin, president of Union Theological Seminary. Ground was broken in 1933 and the cornerstone laid in 1934. At the chapel's dedication on November 20, 1938, Howard Heinz spoke of the meaning of the memorial chapel: > It is located in a community where my father was born and lived his life. It > is on the campus of a university. As part of that university, it is > dedicated to culture, and understanding response to beauty, and religious > worship. Chancellor Bowman commented at the cornerstone laying: > The chapel is designed as a fitting center of worship which in various ways > will rise at the University. The character, intensity, the level of that > worship may change from generation to generation. The spiritual tide in men > rises and falls. Through these changes though, the Chapel will stand, calm > and undisturbed. Since its dedication, the Heinz family and their philanthropies, as well as private donations from other various individuals, have provided ongoing financial support. In 1996, an addition to the chapel's north side containing an elevator provided a permanent structure that allows complete accessibility for those with disabilities. This $1.25 million addition, designed by Landmark Design Associates, was funded with grants from the Heinz Endowments and university capital funds.  Historical timeline  South side of Heinz Chapel in the Fall Interior of Heinz Chapel * January 1914 ‚Äì The Pittsburgh Gazette Times announces the gift of $100,000 from Henry John Heinz to erect a building in memory of his mother, Anna Margaritta Heinz. A letter addressed to the University of Pittsburgh board of trustees from H. J. Heinz states that the building be \\"exclusively used for the religious and social activities of the student body of the university\\". * November 4, 1929 ‚Äì A Deed of Gift is drawn up between Howard Heinz, Clifford Heinz, and Irene E.

Uses The tympanum and main doors Heinz Memorial Chapel is used for various religious services, but as intended from its beginning, it is interdenominational. The chapel is open daily throughout the year except for University holidays, and approximately 1,500 events involving more than 100,000 people take place there annually including religious services, weddings, concerts, classes, memorial services, and guided tours. Between 170 and 190 weddings, which are restricted to affiliates of the University of Pittsburgh and the Heinz employees, are held each year in the chapel. It also serves as the home of the Heinz Chapel Choir Throughout the school year, the 20-voice Pittsburgh Compline Choir, directed by Dr. Mark A. Boyle, sings Compline at 8:00 on Sunday evenings. The Order of Service used by the choir is an expanded version of the Order for Compline in the Lutheran Book of Worship. Compline at Heinz Chapel is a ministry of the Lutheran University Center and First Lutheran Church in Downtown Pittsburgh. Design=Architecture The neo-Gothic chapel was designed by Charles Klauder who also designed the Cathedral of Learning and the Stephen Foster Memorial on Pitt's campus. He was assisted by University architect A. A. Klimcheck. Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor of the University, and Mr. John Weber, Secretary of the University, whom Dr. Bowman sent to Europe to study church architecture for background on the chapel, worked closely with Mr. Klauder in the attempt to achieve on this campus a physical representation of the meaning of a University Chapel. The chapel's form is that of a modified cruciform plan, stone vaults, high ceilings, repeated arches, and extensive use of glass that were typical of American academic and religious architecture of this period. It is long, wide at the transept, and high at the nave with its steeple reaching above the ground. The chapel's walls, inside and out, are of Indiana Limestone. Sadly, Klauder died only a few weeks before the chapel's dedication. In 1996, a $1.3 million elevator housing was added to north side of Heinz Chapel in order to bring in into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The small addition was designed to architecturally mesh with the remainder of the chapel. Stonework The narthex entrance Both inside and out, the walls of the chapel are of grey Indiana limestone. The interior ceiling is lined with a structural acoustical tile which, although it is a ceramic product, approximates stone. The floor of the chapel is crab orchard stone with Vermont green slate in the side aisles. The floor of the Chancel is marble while the altar itself is of Numidian marble, imported from Egypt. The chapel's wall carvings, by master stoneworker Joseph Gattoni of New York, follow the Gothic tradition of pictorial instruction and express the chapel's theme of spiritual values in education. Charles Connick's studio, who is best known for designing the stained glass windows, also designed a large portion of the chapel's stonework, including the Gothic-style shields adorning the stone walls and the tympanum above the main door that portrays the figure of Jesus with symbols of the Alpha and the Omega. =Exterior fa√ßade carving= The tympanum, or recessed arch over the main portal, reflects both the medieval craft of pictorial instruction and the interest of Henry Heinz in the spiritual teachings of his church through his own Sunday school experiences, thus setting the theme for the entire Chapel. The main figure is that of the boy Jesus, relating His youthful revelation to the doctors in the Temple (Luke 2:46-57) . He holds a book inscribed with the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, Alpha and Omega, between which all human thought is contained. To the left of the figure of Jesus is the small figure of Moses with the Tables of Law. Beneath Moses, entwined within the branches of a Tree of Life design, are medallions with portraits of the Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, the Patriarchs Abraham and Jacob, the Priests Aaron and Melchezedech, and King David . On the right of the figure of Jesus is the small figure of St. Luke, beneath which are again medallions within a Tree of Life. These represent St. Luke's and Jesus' spiritual progeny: in charity, St. Francis of Assisi; in imagination, Leonardo da Vinci; in understanding, Newton; in healing, Pasteur; in eloquence, Wordsworth; in leadership, Lincoln; in thought, Emerson. Outside, the insignia of Europe's twelve oldest universities are carved on shields on the gables. Below that on the balustrade parapets are college and universities founded in the United States before 1820. The spandrels beneath show seals of those founded after 1820 and the seals of women's colleges are on the buttresses. =Seals and shieldsEntrance portal Interior of Heinz Chapel as viewed from the balcony The seal of the University of Pittsburgh, the 1930s candle version, is just above the main entrance and is flanked by the seal of the City of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Inside, the stone carvings include the Torah and the Bible, the New Testament beatitudes, and shields of the twelve Apostles. The carvings often take up and extend the theme of the window nearest them.. Parapets In the gables and balustrade circling the transept at its highest point and signifying the chapel's dedication to education, are shields bearing the insignia of the twelve oldest European universities in order of their founding. Along the lower balustrade parapet are carved the seals of American colleges and universities founded before 1820, in order of their founding. The seals of those founded after 1820 are on the spandrels beneath the parapet, and the seals of women's colleges are carved on the buttresses. Narthex To the right and left of the entrance, in the Narthex, two shields represent the Old and New Testaments with the Pentateuch and the Bible. Chancel At the base of the Faith, Hope and Charity windows are the shields of the twelve apostles, each represented by his symbol. Under the Justice and Wisdom windows are fourteen shields representing the fourteen beatitudes, or gifts of the soul, as they appear in the carving of the Cathedral of Chartres. North door The clerestory of Heinz Chapel Over the small door to the left of the chancel as one faces it, is carved the Sacred Monogram above a Tree of Life. Flanking the door are the unicorn, symbol of goodness, and the phoenix, symbol of immortality. Ambulatory doors On either side of the doors leading into the ambulatory are shields representing the four Major Prophets: Isaiah (tongs and burning altar coal), Jeremiah (star-tipped wand), Ezekiel (tetramorph), and Daniel (ram with horns.) Memorial window shields Echoing the theme of the window are symbols of music, the harp and the lyre, early instruments used in songs of praise. Transept Heinz Chapel reredos In the spandrels of the great arches of the transept crossing, eight large shields represent the eight beatitudes given in the Sermon on the Mount. Aisle window shields North aisle shields ‚Äì symbols of the Doctors of the Western, or Latin Church. South aisle shields ‚Äì symbols of the Doctors of the Eastern, or Greek Church. Clerestory shields At the base of the clerestory windows, between the small arches of the triforium gallery are fourteen shields which represent the seven liberal arts and the seven medieval crafts and trades. Narthex shields At the base of the Narthex windows are twelve shields which echo the theme of each window. Wood and iron work All the visible wood in the chapel is oak, including its entrance doors, each of which weighs 800 pounds. The reredos, choir stalls, chancel rails, pulpit, lectern, and narthex screen are of English pollard oak. The pews and narthex ceiling are of Appalachian Mountain oak. Wood carvings were done by Irving and Casson, A.H. Davenport Company of Boston. The four figures carved in the reredos represent the saints Peter, John, Paul the Apostle, and James the Major. All the wrought iron work, including the lanterns, door fittings, stair railings, altar cross, and candlesticks, were created by Samuel Yellin of Philadelphia. (Yellin was also responsible for major working in the adjacent Cathedral of Learning including the Commons Room Gates and most of the metal work in the Nationality Classrooms .) The windows South transept windows of Heinz Memorial Chapel Designer The chapel's 23 windows were designed by Charles Connick and created at his Boston studio. The windows total approximately and contain nearly 250,000 pieces of glass. There are 391 identifiable people in the windows, a large supporting cast of anonymous individuals, and an extensive variety of flora and fauna. Connick was an artist once on the staff of the Pittsburgh Press, and author of Adventures in Light and Color, a work which he has modestly subtitled An Introduction to the Stained Glass Craft. Mr. Connick also has windows in the Cathedrals of St. Patrick and St. John the Divine in New York City, the Princeton University Chapel, the American Church in Paris, and in the Calvary Episcopal and East Liberty Presbyterian churches in Pittsburgh. Heinz Memorial Chapel has the distinction of having all its windows by Mr. Connick, a practice unusual in most churches which prefer to represent in their sanctuaries as many kinds of stained glass artistry as possible. However, because in Heinz Chapel all the windows can be seen at once, and because Mr. Connick began to work so closely with those planning the chapel, and was so widely respected as a worker in stained glass, he was soon commissioned to design and make all of the windows in Heinz Chapel. Design elements Just as in the language of stone carvings, symbols were used in place of words, there was established a language of color in which the colors themselves had meanings and values. In his Divine Comedy, Dante set forth the traditions of this symbolism, and Mr. Connick used this language in Heinz Chapel to express emotions beyond the reach of words. * Red - the warm active color; suggesting passionate devotion, divine love, self-sacrifice, heroism and valor. * Blue ‚Äì the cool contemplative color echoing the light of heaven; symbolic of divine wisdom, profound meditation, enduring loyalty, eternity. * White ‚Äì spiritual achievement, treasure in heaven. And in combination: *Gold ‚Äì yellow merging into brown, changing to gold, symbolic of the treasures of earth; bounty. *Green ‚Äì unites the wisdom of blue with the wealth of gold; hope and victory, happiness and gaiety; spring, youth. *Violet ‚Äì unites the wisdom of blue with the love of red; justice, humility, royalty. While the dominant theme of the chapel is charity, as declared by the Charity window, centered high above the chancel, blue is the most prominent color used in the windows, due to the requirements of stained glass artistry. \\"Blue is light itself,\\" Mr. Connick has said, and he regarded it as the most valuable and lovely color in stained glass. Chancel windows Nativity scene The five chancel windows represent the virtues of justice, faith, charity, hope, and wisdom. These feature acts of Jesus and characters from the Old and New Testament. These windows are complemented on each side by smaller windows over the choir stalls that celebrate music and recognize its importance in worship. The theme of each window is further developed through the use of symbols related to the Tree of Life. The symbol of love, the rose, appears in the Charity Window; the fig tree symbolizes Faith; the pomegranate, Hope; the grapevine, Justice; and the Twelve Golden Fruits of the Tree of Life, Wisdom. Transept windows The tall transept windows are among the tallest stained glass windows in the world and represent temperance, truth, tolerance, and courage. An equal number of men and women are depicted in these windows, unusual in that the equal emphasis on the contributions of both sexes was not typical of the period of their creation. There are a tremendous variety of individuals depicted in these windows drawn from religion and all aspects of secular history, music, science, philosophy, poetry and literature. Secular figures range from Beethoven and Bach to Clara Barton; from Da Vinci to Daniel Boone; from Charlemagne to Chaucer to Confucius; from Emily Dickinson to Keats to Sir Isaac Newton; form Napoleon to Ben Franklin and George Washington; from Rousseau to Shakespeare to Florence Nightingale; from Pocahontas to Pasteur and Edgar Allan Poe; from Tennyson to Thoreau, and a myriad in between including Johnny Appleseed. Clerestory windows The four clerestory windows, high above the aisles, present great teachers and interpreters of Christian thought. The three gallery windows at the west end of the chapel represent three great Christian literary works: * St. Francis of Assisi's Canticle of the Sun Also called the Praise and Thanksgiving window, the left narthex window preserves in stained glass the Canticle of the Sun by St. Francis of Assisi. The canticle is pictured in the series of medallions and forms, articulated by stars, birds, fishes and hovering flames. The great surmounting figures are Brother Sun and Sister Moon, below which are personifications of the four elements ‚Äì Air, Water, Fire, Earth. The small medallion designs are related to the life of St. Francis. The center tracery piece contains the figure of God as the Divine Creator. *John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress The central Narthex window presents John Bunyan's allegoric Pilgrim's Progress, symbolically tracing the pilgrim's journey from angular shapes at the window's base to the bursting fruit of the Tree of Life at its top. The dominant figures of Christian and Hopeful surmount the lancets. The center tracery piece presents the New Jerusalem, with Enoch, Moses and Elijah welcoming the Pilgrim at journey's end. *The Quest for the Holy Grail from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Also called the Holy Grail Window, the right narthex window traces the story of the search for the Holy Grail as told in Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale's sister are the dominant figures surmounting the lancets. The growing forms most often take the shape of lilies, symbols of Purity. In the corners are designs of heraldic lions (symbols of Courage), Unicorns (symbols of Virginity), and Serpents and Dragons (sinfulness and the Power of Evil), suggesting the ideals of Chivalry and the temptations besetting the searchers. The center tracery piece presents the Vision of the Grail at the end of the search. The organ Pulpit detail Original instrument The chapel organ was originally a four manual Aeolian Skinner pipe organ with 3,770 pipes. The organ pipes range in size from the size of a pencil up to wooden boxes two feet square. The console itself was in a sunken recess at the right of the Chancel and the pipes were concealed behind the Chancel triforium gallery and the gold and blue ecclesiastical cloth above the gallery. Updated instrument In the 1960s, the cloth was gradually removed, it was deteriorating, had a detrimental effect on the organ sound and presented a fire hazard. By this time, the organ was in serious need of attention and in 1969 work was begun on the installation of a new instrument by the M. P. M√∂ller Company. This included the addition of a small Gallery Console which could be used to play only those pipes in the rear Gallery, useful for duets or if the main instrument required emergency service. The new Moller instrument was dedicated on 21-Mar-1971 by University Organist, Dr. Robert S. Lord and Dr. Russell G. Wichmann, organist at Chatham College. This instrument had approximately 3,954 pipes and 82 stops and 70 ranks (unique sounds). The Heinz Endowments funded this purchase. The organ was greatly enhanced by the addition of three electronic 32' ranks by the Allen Organ Company in January 1989 under the supervision of Dr. Lord made possible by a grant from the Heinz endowments. This permitted the organ to produce deep, resonant bass tones. It was one of the first uses of electronic sounds to enhance an existing pipe organ. Current instrument In the early 1990s, the M√∂ller became increasingly unreliable and it was deemed necessary to perform major work on the instrument. This coincided with the work done in 1994 to make the chapel accessible for those with physical disabilities. The Reuter Organ Company was engaged to do this work. The renovated Reuter instrument was dedicated in concert on 24-Sep-1995. Re-created in 1994-95 by the Reuter Organ Company, it represents a trend in American organ building to re-use existing materials in an environmentally friendly and musically sound manner. The Chancel console has three manuals (keyboards) and pedalboard that control all 4,272 pipes (73 ranks) and three electronic 32' pedal stops. For concerts, this console may be moved to the front of the chancel in full view of the audience. A second console (two manuals and pedal) located in the rear gallery controls pipes located in the alcoves adjacent to the gallery. The main console also has access to the rear gallery pipes. While most of the main organ pipes are located around the front chancel a commanding \\"tuba\\" (trumpet) stop is located above in a ceiling chamber. A complete history of the organ is available in the Docent Guide for the Organ at Heinz Chapel the first edition of which was prepared in 2003 by Jon J. Danzak. A copy of the book as well as two CDs were placed on deposit at the Music Library of the University of Pittsburgh by Dr. Robert S. Lord (Professor Emeritus) who served as University organist for over 40 years. These are the specifications for Reuter Opus 2176.

The original, which was written by a canon of St Peter's, dates from the 1140s. The text survives in numerous manuscripts. \\"Unhampered by any very accurate knowledge of the historical continuity of the city, the unknown author has described the monuments of Rome, displaying a considerable amount of inventive faculty,\\" the Catholic Encyclopedia reports. The legend-filled Mirabilia remained the standard guide to the city until the fifteenth century. At the time it was written, the inhabited part of Rome, the abitato, was a small city located in the bend of the Tiber River surrounded by the ruins of the great ancient city, where within the standing walls and gates of the ancient city were fields where cattle sheep and goats grazed among the temples and baths, giving to the Roman Forum its name Campo Vaccino (the \\"cow pasture\\"). From the pontificate of Boniface VIII (1294-1303) to that of John XXII (1316-34) the text was revised and enlarged. Its authority was unquestioned until the 15th century, when two authors set out to supersede it with new descriptions from a fresh Renaissance point of view. One was Leon Battista Alberti's Descriptio urbis Romae, written ca.1433. Another was Flavio Biondo's Roma instaurata, written in 1444 and circulated in manuscript; it was printed in 1481. Modern critical attention was first drawn to the different versions of Mirabilia Urbis Romae by the 19th-century archaeologist of Christian Rome, Giovanni Battista de Rossi, in Roma Sotterranea (vol I, 1864, pp 158ff). The edition of Louis Duchesne in the Liber Censuum de l'Eglise Romaine (I, Paris, 1905, 262-73), gave the text of the original of Cencius Camerarius with the variants of four other manuscripts. In 1889, Francis Morgan Nichols published the first English translation, which was reprinted in 1986 by Italica Press.http://www.italicapress.com/index065.html Contents The contents of the Mirabilia fall into the following sections, the title headings being taken from the \\"Liber Censuum\\": *De muro urbis (concerning the wall of the city); *De portis urbis (the gates of the city); *De miliaribus (the milestones); *Nomina portarum (the names of the gates); *Quot porte sunt Transtiberim (how many gates are beyond the Tiber); *De arcubus (the arches); *De montibus (the hills); *De termis (the baths); *De palatiis (the palaces); *De theatris (the theatres); *De locis qui inveniuntur in sanctorum passionibus (the places mentioned in the \\"passions\\" of the saints); *De pontibus (the bridges); *De cimiteriis (the cemeteries); *De iussione Octaviani imperatoris et responsione Sibille (the Emperor Octavian's question and the Sibyl's response); *Quare facti sunt caballi marmorei (why the marble horses were made); *De nominibus iudicum et eorum instructionibus (the names of the judges and their instructions); *De columna Antonii et Trajani (the column of Antony and Trajan); *Quare factus sit equus qui dicitur Constantinus (why the horse was made, which is called of Constantine); *Quare factum sit Pantheon et postmodum oratio B. (why the Pantheon was built and later oration B.); *Quare Octavianus vocatus sit Augustus et quare dicatur ecclesia Sancti Petri ad vincula (Why Octavianus was called Augustus, and why the church of St. Peter ad Vincula was so called); *De vaticano et Agulio (of the Vatican and the Needle);The memoria Caesaris, id est Agulia (memorial of Caesar, that is, the Needle) referred to by our pilgrim author is the Vatican obelisk. A misreading of dedicatory inscription led to the belief that it stood above Julius Caesar's sarcophagus. Cf. Francis Morgan Nichols' translation of the Mirabilia with notes (1889). In the Middle Ages the church of Sanctus Stephanus de Agulia stood nearby. It was demolished in 1776. *Quot sunt templa trans Tiberim (how many temples are beyond the Tiber); *Predicatio sanctorum (the preaching of the saints).

Raised in 1942 as a long-range fighter unit, the squadron saw action in the Second World War, serving in the South West Pacific Area against the Japanese and operating mainly in the ground attack and anti-shipping roles from bases in New Guinea and the Netherlands East Indies. After the war, the squadron was disbanded, however, it was re-raised a short time later as a unit of the part-time Citizen Air Force, operating in the target towing and air defence role in New South Wales. In 1960s the squadron ceased flying aircraft and operated surface-to-air missiles, providing for the defence of Sydney and Darwin before disbanding in 1968. The squadron was re-raised again in 2010 and since then it has served as an airbase support squadron located at RAAF Base East Sale. History=Second World War No. 30 Squadron was established at RAAF Base Richmond on 9 March 1942 as a long-range fighter squadron operating the Bristol Beaufighter.. After a brief period of training the squadron deployed to Townsville where it escorted anti-shipping patrols. In early September a small detachment from the squadron was sent to Milne Bay from where they attacked Japanese shipping, becoming the first RAAF Beaufighter squadron to see action. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the squadron was deployed to Port Moresby in New Guinea from where it operated as a low-level ground attack unit supporting the Allied efforts in Papua, a role in which the Beaufighter proved highly successful. No. 30 Squadron's primary mission during the war was attacking Japanese shipping and coastal bases, with the focus initially being upon targets around Buna and Sanananda, before being expanded to support operations along the Kokoda Track, Goodenough Island and Lae. In early 1943 the squadron took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, an air-sea battle which resulted in heavy losses for the Japanese. During the battle, the squadron's aircraft conducted low-level attacks on Japanese shipping. They later attacked a Japanese airbase around Lae, destroying a significant number of Japanese aircraft.. In July 1943, the squadron was moved to Goodenough Island, tasked with attacking Japanese airfields and searching for supply barges that were being moved along the coast between Madang and Nassau Bay. It also undertook convoy escort duties for Allied ships transiting the area. No. 30 Squadron remained on the island until November, when the squadron was moved to Kiriwina. In March 1944, the squadron became part of No. 77 Wing, along with Nos. 22 and 31 Squadrons.. It was then relocated to Tadji, from where it continued to interdict Japanese barge-borne supplies in the Aitape‚ÄìWewak region; these proved very successful and in October the squadron's arsenal was expanded to include air-to-ground rockets. As part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force, No. 30 Squadron moved to Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies in November 1944 carrying out operations in the Celebes Sea and the islands of Ambon, Ceram and Halmahera. During this time, the squadron suffered a serious set back when it lost two aircraft destroyed and eight damaged in a Japanese night air raid; however, the losses were made up through either replacements or repairs and operations continued. During 1945, No. 30 Squadron supported Australian operations in Borneo and in May it deployed to Tarakan, flying operations from that island in support of the Australian landing at Balikpapan. The squadron returned to Australia in December 1945 on board and was disbanded at Deniliquin, New South Wales, on 15 August 1946. During the war, 68 of the squadron's personnel were killed in action or died on active service. The following decorations were bestowed upon members of the squadron: one Order of the British Empire, two Distinguished Service Orders, 26 Distinguished Flying Crosses and one bar, one Distinguished Flying Medal and three Mentions in the Despatches. Post-war An ex-30 Squadron Bristol Bloodhound missile on display at the RAAF Museum No. 30 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Richmond as No. 30 (Target Towing) Squadron on 3 March 1948 through the redesignation of the Target Towing and Special Duties Squadron, which had been formed from a single flight at Richmond in September 1947. In this role the squadron supported Army, Air Force and Navy training exercises and research conducted by the CSIRO, operating a variety of aircraft including Beaufighters, Beauforts, Dakotas, Wirraways, Ansons and Mustangs. It was moved around a few times during this period, firstly to Schofields, New South Wales, RAAF Base Fairbairn and then back to Richmond. The squadron was again disbanded on 21 March 1956. On 11 January 1961, No. 30 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Williamtown as a Surface-to-Air Guided Weapons Squadron equipped with Bloodhound missiles. In this role the squadron provided air defence to the Sydney region and, from June 1965, to Darwin during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. The squadron was disbanded again on 30 November 1968. To date, No. 30 Squadron is the only RAAF unit to have operated surface-to-air missiles, as ground-based air defence is currently provided by an Army unit, the 16th Air Land Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. No. 30 Squadron was re-raised on 1 July 2010 as the unit responsible for providing airbase support services to RAAF Base East Sale.

He served with distinction during World War II, where he commanded the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment in Sicily, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany from 1942 to 1945. He was one of the youngest regimental commanders of the war. Early life Charleston (in what was then the Province of Carolina), where he was to die, had been settled from Bermuda under William Sayle in 1670, and many Bermudian families long remained prominent there. Notable among these was the Atlantic archipelago's Tucker family, which included Thomas Tudor Tucker and several notable Henry Tuckers. Reuben Henry Tucker III's paternal line, however, actually traces back to Robert Tucker, born in 1604 in Gravesend, Kent, England, who died in Milton, Massachusetts in 1682. Reuben Henry Tucker III was born in 1911 to Reuben Henry Tucker, Jr. and his wife, Clare ( Booth). He was active in sports and Boy Scouts in his youth, proving his bravery and resourcefulness at 13 by pulling his drowning younger brother and a friend from a freezing mill pond. For this, he received a local award for heroism from the Scouts. While the boys in his high school social fraternity would nickname him \\"Duke\\" for his good looks and fastidious dress, and his family would call him \\"Tommy\\", he would be known by many as simply \\"Rube\\". West Point Tucker's path to the United States Military Academy at West Point was not quite direct. The Tucker family had produced soldiers for all of America's wars since the Revolution, and worked in Ansonia's brass mill between wars. Tucker himself spent a year in the mill before entering a West Point prep school, Millard's. Despite passing the entrance exam, he did not secure an appointment in 1929 and spent a year out in Wyoming before joining the Class of 1934. Due to a failing grade in mathematics, Tucker washed out of West Point. Fortunately, his determination to remain at the academy helped him in passing two days of exams for re-admission, which allowed him to be \\"turned back\\" and join the Class of 1935. Tucker married on the day following graduation. He and his wife would raise five boys over the ensuing decades. World War II Tucker volunteered for the paratroopers, part of the United States Army's newly created airborne forces, at Fort Benning, Georgia. Upon graduation Tucker, now a captain, was assigned to the 504th Parachute Infantry Battalion. Following activation of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), on 1 May 1942, Tucker, now a major, was assigned as the executive officer. The 504th was later assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, under Major General Matthew Ridgway. On 6 December 1942, Ridgway selected Tucker to command the 504th. The other two regiments of the 325th and 326th Glider Infantry, along with supporting units. The 326th was later replaced by the 505th PIR. At 31 years of age, Tucker was one of the youngest regimental commanders during the war, despite his delay in entering and graduating from West Point. On 11 July 1943, Tucker, who was by now a full colonel, led his troops in the Allied invasion of Sicily. There the American ground and sea forces, mistaking the 504th's aircraft for enemy planes, fired on the formations, resulting in the catastrophic loss of 23 aircraft, numerous casualties, and the scattering of troops all over the island. Tucker also led the 504th PIR during the Italian Campaign at Salerno and Anzio, at Nijmegen during Operation Market Garden, and during the Battle of the Bulge. Due to the number of casualties sustained during the fighting in Italy, Tucker and the rest of the 504th did not participate in the Allied invasion of Normandy, instead remaining in England. Colonel Tucker was an outstanding combat leader during the war, and had a marked and lasting influence on many members of the 504th PIR through his traits of character, leadership ability, sense of humor, and understanding. He was affectionately referred to as \\"The Little Colonel\\" by the troops, and his presence among them often inspired their will to fight under adverse conditions. While fighting on the Anzio beachhead, they became known as the \\"Devils in Baggy Pants.\\" The nickname remains with the regiment today. Colonel James M. Gavin, who originally commanded the 505th PIR and later commanded the 82nd Airborne Division, stated in his book, \\"On to Berlin\\": \\"The 504th was commanded by a tough, superb combat leader, Colonel Reuben H. Tucker was probably the best regimental commander of the war.\\" Gavin admitted that Tucker Post-war assignments Following the war, Colonel Tucker held varied positions and assignments, including as Commander 1st Cadet Regiment, West Point; staff and faculty, Air War College; student, Army War College; Commandant of Cadets, The Citadel; Assistant Division Commander, 101st Airborne Division and Chief Infantry Officers Branch, Department of the Army. Subsequent assignments were Commanding General of Fort Dix; Chief Military Assistance Advisory Group in Laos, and Assistant Chief of Staff G-3, United States Army, Pacific. Retirement Tucker retired from the army in 1963, settling in Charleston, South Carolina, to assume a position he previously held on active duty, Commandant of Cadets at the Citadel where he remained until retiring a second time in February 1968. On 6 January 1970, Tucker was found collapsed on the Citadel campus, the victim of an apparent heart attack. Funeral services were held in Beaufort, South Carolina, on 9 January 1970. Tucker's final resting place in Beaufort National Cemetery is located in close proximity to the graveside of his oldest son, who was killed in action in Vietnam. Awards and decorations Tucker was highly decorated for his service in World War II. He was awarded two Distinguished Service Crosses, the United States' second highest medal for bravery, one of which was personally presented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during a visit to Castelvetrano, Sicily, in December 1943, for extraordinary heroism under hostile fire in Italy in September. * Distinguished Service Cross, twice * Silver Star * Legion of Merit, twice * Bronze Star Medal * Commendation Medal * Purple Heart * Combat Infantryman Badge * Knight 4th Class of the Military Order of William (Netherlands, 22 February 1946) References * * Category:1911 births Category:1970 deaths Category:People from Ansonia, Connecticut Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:United States Army generals Category:United States Military Academy alumni Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Knights Fourth Class of the Military Order of William Category:The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina staff ","title":"Reuben Henry Tucker III"},{"id":"3565805","text":"E.F. Band was a Swedish band that sometimes were mixed up with the New wave of British heavy metal movement, even though they were Swedish. The band was formed in 1978 by bassist/vocalist P√§r Ericsson and guitarist Bengt Fischer, two former members of the progressive rock band Epizootic, who were initially joined by Tommy Lager on drums. The \\"E.F.\\" portion of the band's name was derived from the first letter of Ericsson and Fischer's last names. After recording their first (split) single, the band hired British drummer Dave Dufort, who had played with Mike Oldfield and Screaming Lord Sutch to solidify the line-up. Dufort would record the \\"Self Made Suicide\\" and \\"Devil's Eye' singles and the Metal For Muthas, Vol. 1 contribution \\"Fighting For Rock And Roll\\" with the band but left before the first full-length album, Last Laugh Is On You, produced by Derek Lawrence of Deep Purple fame. Dufort was replaced by Dag Eliason, thereby making the band an all-Swedish trio once again. E.F. Band supported the album by touring as openers for Rainbow on their European tour. Coming off the road, the band decided to expand to a 4-piece adding Dutchman John Ridge as lead vocalist in 1982 who would feature on the second album, Deep Cut. Again the band hit the road, this time as support for Saxon on their European tour in addition to headlining their own shows. Tony Borg (Alien), was added as extra guitarist but he didn't stay for long as \\"it wasn't his band\\". Although things seemed to be going well, Ridge announced his departure from the band and was replaced by London-based Roger Marsden (ex-Deep Machine, Angel Witch) in 1983. The band also decided to add a second guitarist and eventually brought in future King Diamond guitarist Andy LaRocque, then known as Anders Allhage, to strengthen their sound. With Marsden and Allhage on board, the band recorded what would be their third and final studio album, One Night Stand, released in 1985. After playing a few scattered shows to promote the record, E.F. Band broke up in 1986. 2003 saw the release of the two-disc retrospective Their Finest Hours, which contained all three of the band's studio albums, the \\"Self Made Suicide\\" and \\"Devil's Eye\\" singles, and several unreleased studio and live bonus tracks. The album's final track, \\"Remembering You\\", is a tribute to E.F. Band co-founder Bengt Fischer, who succumbed to cancer on April 5, 2001, written and performed by John Boutkam, aka John Ridge. A live album, Live At The Mudd Club In Gothenburg 1983, recorded by the Deep Cut line-up with John Ridge on vocals, was issued in 2005. Ridge died on March 4, 2003 after a lengthy battle with brain cancer. After his time with the E.F. Band, Ridge had been working in radio, as a presenter at OK Radio in Hamburg, Germany, calling himself John de Graaf, and at Radio Caroline where he hosted the \\"New Americana\\" program under his real name, John Boutkam.

Ostensibly a treatise on the Seven Liberal Arts, it merely uses them as a framework in which to describe and demystify practical tricks, ‚Äòtricks of the trade‚Äô and applied science. Sections Prologue (Iste liber quem per manibus habemus vocatur Secretum Philosophorum.) Book I is nominally on ‚ÄòGrammar‚Äô which ‚Äòteaches us to write correctly‚Äô (Grammatica docet recte scribere et recte loqui). Explaining that no-one can write correctly without the proper instruments, the subsequent text consists of technical recipes for the materials required ‚Äòfor correct writing‚Äô, plus some recipes for concealing meanings by the use of invisible ink and ciphers. Book I is thus in fact an artists' recipe book. Book I thus includes recipes for pigments, tempering, adhesives, varnish, writing tablets, artificial pumice and invisible ink, and for writing on metal by etching; many of these technical recipes are unique, rare, variant or unusually early witnesses to practices, or clarify obscure recipes in other treatises; the instructions appear to be for amateur use. Book I then ends with homilies on ‚Äòcorrect speaking‚Äô (discretion and the dangers of lying), taken from the pseudo-Aristotle Secretum secretorum, with a note on ‚Äòweasel words‚Äô for concealing meaning. Book II, ‚ÄòRhetoric‚Äô ‚Äòteaches ornate speech‚Äô (Rethorica docet ornate loqui). It collects riddles. Book III, ‚ÄòDialectic‚Äô ‚Äòteaches to discern between true and false‚Äô (Dialetica docet discernere verum a falso et ab apparenti vero). It collects various tricks for deceiving the five senses, with mirrors and conjuring tricks. Book IV, ‚ÄòArithmetic‚Äô ‚Äòteaches numbers per se‚Äô (Arismetrica docet de numero per se). It rejoices in the multiplication of chains of immense numbers. Part V, ‚ÄòMusic‚Äô ‚Äòteaches the numbers of sound‚Äô (Musica docet de numero sonoro). It describes the monochord, and a recipe for gut strings. Book VI, ‚ÄòGeometry‚Äô ‚Äòteaches magnitudes, i.e. to measure‚Äô (Geometria docet de magnitudinibus id est de mensuris quantitatum). It gives practical tricks for measuring, especially buildings. Book VII, ‚ÄòAstronomy‚Äô ‚Äòteaches movements of the heavens and their effects on men‚Äô (Astronomia docet de magnitudine mobili hoc est de motibus firmamenti et planetarum et eorum effectibus). It is principally astrology, but includes a very early illustrated treatise on hydraulics. Manuscripts, editions and translations Nearly 30 manuscripts of the Secretum philosophorum survive,Most of which are listed in Clarke 2009 op. cit. making it something of a medieval 'bestseller', and Lynn Thorndike considered the Secretum philosophorum to have formed part of the general intellectual furniture of most even partially well-read individuals, and urged its publication.Thorndike, Lynn \\"Prospectus for a Corpus of Medieval Scientific Literature in Latin\\" Isis Vol. 14 No. 2 (Oct. 1930) pp.368-384: p. 379 item 120 Nevertheless, as yet no complete edition or translation has been published.

It has been used in mottoes like Roma invicta (Latin for \\"Unconquered Rome\\"), and it is the motto of the county of Kent, England.www.civicheraldry.co.uk Kent heraldry site Theories of origin \\"Invicta\\" has been a motto for centuries. Roma invicta is a Latin phrase, meaning \\"Unconquered Rome\\", inscribed on a statue in Rome. It was an inspirational motto used until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. This symbolic statement was later printed onto gold coins, to help boost the morale of the failing Empire. For Kent, it dates back to the invasion of England by William the Conqueror. As the official motto, it appears on the coat of arms of Kent County Council. Legend has it that, while marching from the 1066 battle site at Hastings, William marched on to London on his way to the (then) capital Winchester. While passing through Kent, the local people picked up branches and marched at William's men. Scared, William and his army took flight and took a different route to London. As the people of Kent felt that they had chased William away, they adopted \\"Invicta\\" as a county motto. Kent Invicta monument A different version of the legend above is depicted on a monument at Swanscombe, where legend states this meeting took place on the Old Roman Road to London (Watling Street). The monument, sculpted by Hilary Stratton and unveiled in 1958, was moved in the early 1960s due to the construction of the A2 dual carriageway. It is now located in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul's Church in Swanscombe, where the picture (right) was taken. The monument states that: > Near this spot by ancient tradition the men of Kent and Kentish men carrying > boughs on their shoulders and swords in their hands met the invader William > Duke of Normandy. They offered peace if he would grant their ancient rights > and liberties otherwise war and that most deadly. Their request was granted > and from that day the motto of Kent has been INVICTA meaning Unconquered. Its origin has also been said to have been because Dover was not besieged or defeated on William's march through Kent, but instead agreed to a conditional surrender to him, on its own terms, and was therefore not conquered by him. Holding of land in Kent by gavelkind, rather than the feudal-Norman laws of primogeniture, lasted until the early 20th century suggesting that the people of the county did indeed acquire some concessions from the Conqueror. Local influences As the motto of the county, \\"Invicta\\" is now a frequently used term within Kent. Other uses \\"Cidade Invicta\\" (\\"Unvanquished City\\") is the nickname of the city of Porto, Portugal. It was earned during the Napoleonic invasions in the 19th century. \\"Stellaris Invicta\\" is the name of a YouTube series made by the channel \\"The Templin Institute\\".

Located north-northeast of the city in the Capodichino district of Naples, the airport is officially named Aeroporto di Napoli-Capodichino Ugo Niutta, after decorated WWI pilot Ugo Niutta. History The district of Capodichino ‚Äì in the area known as \\"Campo di Marte\\" ‚Äì hosted the first flight exhibitions in Naples in 1910. During the First World War, \\"Campo di Marte\\" became a military airport in order to defend the town against Austro-Hungarian and German air attacks. During World War II, it was used as a combat airfield by the United States Army Air Forces and the Royal Air Force extensively during the Italian Campaign. The airfield was first used by RAF No. 324 Wing with its five squadrons of Supermarine Spitfires in 1943. It was then used by the US Twelfth Air Force which stationed the following units at the airport: 79th Fighter Group (January‚ÄìMay 1944, P-40 Warhawk/P-47 Thunderbolt); 47th Bombardment Group (March‚ÄìApril 1944, A-20 Havoc); 33d Fighter Group (April‚ÄìMay 1944, P-40 Warhawk). When the combat units moved out, Air Transport Command used the airport as a major transshipment hub for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel for the remainder of the war.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Commercial traffic started in 1950. In 1980 GE.S.A.C. (\\"Gestione Servizi Aeroporto Capodichino\\") was established to administer the airport; in 1982 it became \\"Gestione Servizi Aeroporti Campani\\" and participated in by the City Council, the province of Naples and Alitalia. In 1995 GE.S.A.C. drew up ‚Äì with BAA assistance ‚Äì a new master plan, which marked the beginning of a twenty- year development plan. After two years (1997) GE.S.A.C. was the first airport management company in Italy to be privatised: BAA acquires 70% of the share package from the City Council and Province of Naples. In 1998 the \\"Galleria Napoli\\" opened, a shopping arcade open 365 days a year inside Terminal 1. In 2002 H.R.H. Prince Charles inaugurated the new departure lounge. Facilities Check-in hall Control tower and hangars The airport has one terminal building: Terminal 1 is used for all the flights. The airport has a single runway (orientation: 06/24 ‚Äì ‚Äì resistance: PCN90/F/B/W/T ‚Äì assistance: PAPI, ILS) in bituminous conglomerate and concrete, with one taxiway. There is one apron with 29 stands, 9 of which self-maneuvering and the remaining Push Back. The airport is class 4D ICAO and has the classification of military airport opened to commercial air traffic 24 hours/day. The airport management company is fully responsible for managing the airport and coordinating and control activities of all the private operators present in the airport. Capodichino hosts some aeronautical industrial activities, like Atitech, Alenia Aeronautica, Aeronavali, Tecnam Costruzioni Aeronautiche.

Following a report 30 minutes after departure when the crew reported en route at 6500 feet and switching to the Rome ATC, nothing further was heard from the flight, which never contacted Rome, nor arrived in Greece. Dense fog over the Ionian Sea and mountainous southern Italy on 17 February greatly impeded search efforts for the missing aircraft. \\"U.S. authorities did not exclude the possibility the plane might have been forced down in Communist Albania.\\"Associated Press, \\"Fog Hurts Search For Missing Plane\\", The State, Columbia, South Carolina, Tuesday 18 February 1958, Number 24,290, page 5-A On 19 February 1958, the burned and scattered wreckage was found high on the rugged slope of Mount Vesuvius at the 3,800-foot level, about 200 feet below the top of the cone of the volcano. A search plane first spotted the wreckage following \\"four days of fruitless ground, sea and air search impeded by fog, rain and snow.\\" Patrols of U.S. servicemen, Italian soldiers and carabinieri reached the crash site four hours after it was found, battling though heavy snow, but reported no survivors amongst the 16 on board. They stated that all had been identified. According to a 1958 Associated Press report, \\"a surgeon said death apparently was instantaneous.\\" There were 15 Air Force officers and men from Ramstein- Landstuhl Air Base, and one seaman of the USS Tripoli on board. The report stated that \\"officials declined to venture a theory on the cause of the crash except that the weather was bad and the pilot, Capt. Martin S. Schwartz of Ashland, Kentucky, had not previously flown from Capodichino field.\\"Associated Press, \\"On Mount Vesuvius: Plane Is Found; 16 Dead\\", The State, Columbia, South Carolina, Thursday 20 February 1958, Number 24,292, page 3-A.

Another Merz Apothecary operates in the Palmer House Hilton. History Peter Merz, a pharmacist of Swiss descent, opened the store in 1875, using the name \\"Apothecary\\" as his customers were predominantly European. The store was quite typical of drug corner stores at the time, and focused on herbal medicines that his European customers were already accustomed to. The store had a secondary function as a gathering place; it contained comfortable seating such as leather chairs, and allowed patrons to sit and chat while waiting for their medicinal orders to be prepared. Furthermore, pharmacists at the Apothecary were multilingual and facilitated ease of communication between the employees and the diverse base of customers. Current pharmacists at the store continue to be able to speak several languages. The store continued to perform well through the 1960s. In 1972, and after three-generations of Merz owners, then-owner Ralph Merz sought to retire but there was no one in the family to succeed him as owner. The store was to be closed, but one month before the planned closing, 26-year-old Pakistani pharmacist Abdul Qaiyum offered to purchase the building and continue to run the business under the same name. Qaiyum moved the store to its present location in the Lincoln Square neighborhood in 1982, and custom-built the store in style of a 20th-century apothecary. This style is reflected in the interior of the store through the antique pharmacy jars, leaded glass windows, parquet floors, tin ceilings, and solid oak cabinets. Present day Qaiyum later passed on ownership of the store to his son, Anthony. The store also began to run a website for online orders called SmallFlower.com in 1998. Anthony Qaiyum noted that he chose the domain name because of obscurity of the store's name; he had asked many of his friends if they could spell the word apothecary or knew how to define it. Qaiyum said that \\"both of them were depressing results.\\" In 2009, the store upgraded its e-commerce and inventory management systems. One motivation for this change were sudden spikes in product demand; in these situations, the store could not meet the full demand. For instance, on her talk show, Oprah Winfrey had once selected a Claus Porto soap product as one of her favorites. The website received orders amounting to tens of thousands of dollars, but only a fraction of those orders were able to be filled. Qaiyum opened another storefront inside of a Macy's in downtown Chicago in 2003, which was later moved to the Palmer House Hilton. Products Since its inception, Merz Apothecary has focused heavily on herbal, homeopathic medicines, particularly European products. The store is also known for its wide array of bath products. Some of its most popular products in 2011 included Nivea cream, Underberg bitters, soap made from brazil nuts, and Oscillococcinum. Events In 2011 and 2012, Merz Apothecary hosted The Great Shave, an event featuring demonstrations of traditional men's shaving in addition to seminars on related topics such as the use of the straight razor and the use of lather. The event has been considered the largest event dedicated to wet shaving in the United States. The event sold out in both years.

The public cable network C-SPAN documented the event on video. Event timeline The event started at 11:00 am near the Washington Monument, led by the American Atheists' banner promoting the separation of church and state. About halfway down the Mall the people were confronted by counter-protesters. However, they continued to proceed to the other end of the Mall in front of the Capitol. At 11:30 am, the rally started and featured over 20 speakers and musical entertainment. The rally lasted for about four hours. Slogans The event was marked by many slogans and banners on shirts, badges, etc., including \\"What Our Schools Need is a Moment of Science!\\", \\"Atheism is Myth-Understood!\\", \\"Secular Humanists for a Secular America\\" and \\"Citizen‚ÄìAtheist‚ÄìPatriot\\". The official T-shirt for the march showed a picture of the Capitol and the American flag with the statement \\"Free, Proud and on the Move‚ÄìGODLESS AMERICANS\\". Speeches Many speakers delivered speeches at the March. A few noted speakers were Frank Zindler, editor of the American Atheist magazine, Margaret Downey of the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia and Ed Buckner, executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism. The speeches delivered were basically on theism, atheism and related themes. Buckner reportedly attacked the way theists perceive atheists as lacking morality. Aims and objectives Over two thousand atheists, freethinkers, agnostics and humanists gathered in a mile-long parade down The Mall to rally for several causes, including civil rights, church-state separation and a greater voice in the national political process. Ellen Johnson, a former president of American Atheists and director of the Godless Americans March On Washington Task Force, announced at the event the formation of the Godless Americans Political Action Committee (GAMPAC), later renamed Enlighten the Vote. Event speakers Speakers at the event included: * Michael Newdow, activist * Ed Buckner, Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism * Taslima Nasrin, Bangladesh feminist and dissident writer * Eddie Tabash, California attorney * Douglas Campbell, Green Party candidate for Governor of Michigan * August Brunsman, Secular Student Alliance founder * Michael Rivers, Director of American Atheists in Utah * Kathleen Johnson, Founder of the Military Association of Atheists & Freethinkers (MAAF), which provided security at the event * Norm Allen, from the African Americans for Humanism * Larry Darby, from the Alabama Atheists * Bobbie Kirkhart from the Atheist Alliance International * Margaret Downey from the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia * Jim Strayer, from the Atheists of Florida * John Scalise, from the Great Lakes Humanists * Harry Greenberger from the New Orleans Secular Humanists * \\"Reverend\\" Chris Harper of the fictitious Landover Baptist Church (also known as Americhrist Ltd.) Reaction and results Atheist groups by and large considered the march a success, \\\\- \\\\- though some within the atheist community did criticize the event for a number of reasons, including the exclusion of theists from being able to endorse the event, how atheism was defined for the purposes of the march, and the apparent attempt by organizers to use the march as a way of \\"creating an identity for non-believers\\". An organization calling itself the Religious Freedom Coalition ran newspaper advertisements the day before the event characterizing the views of atheists and Satanists to be identical. Following the event, the same organization called the event a success, but described it as \\"ill timed\\" and an indication of a dangerous brand of new atheism. Following the march, leaders of three atheist organizations ‚Äî Atheist Alliance International, the Institute for Humanist Studies and the Internet Infidels ‚Äî met and set in motion the founding of the Secular Coalition for America. Hemant Mehta of the blog the Friendly Atheist and the author of I Sold My Soul on eBay referred to the event in the context of the Reason Rally which was held on Saturday March 24, 2012. Paul Geisert set up the Brights movement.

It was founded by Rodger MacGowan in 1975, and began publication the following year. In 1988, World Wide Wargames (also known as 3W) acquired Diverse Talents Inc. (DTI), publisher of Fire & Movement, Battleplan and Space Gamer, leading to a complete merger of the two companies. 3W then continued on to publish four gaming magazines simultaneously. John Vanore was the only \\"outsider\\" appointed to editorial duties, taking the reins of F&M; at the time. F&M; is now published by Decision Games. In January 2010, the last \\"print\\" edition of the magazine was published. Editing and layout had been outsourced to Jon Compton to preserve the independence of the magazine content, but subscriptions and newsstand sales continued to decline. As of February 2010, Fire & Movement had been redesignated as an online magazine, and is undergoing retooling. Editorial duties have since been assigned to Eric Harvey. F&M; was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design's Hall of Fame in 1999. Beginnings Rodger B. MacGowan started wargaming when he was in high school in the late 1960s. After a hiatus due to the Vietnam War (in his words, \\"girls also had a major impact\\"), he returned to the hobby in the 1970s with his old playing partners, who had now moved to different cities. They started to correspond with each other about gaming, and MacGowan started to detail the games in a format he referred to as \\"Battle Report\\". He included maps and analyses of his games, and his reports proved to be so popular with his friends that he expanded his concept to create his first magazine, entitled Arquebus. Many of the concepts that F&M; would later make famous were included, such as game reviews, game reports, hobby news, and feedback analysis from readers. As he became more involved in the writing of Arquebus, a friend suggested \\"going professional\\". Using his background as a professional graphic designer in both advertising and magazine production, he approached Baron Publishing Company, who expressed interest in printing the magazine, as long as MacGowan did the work. MacGowan next contacted Mark Saha, who wrote for The General and Moves magazines. Since he was playtesting the next big release from Avalon Hill ‚Äî Tobruk ‚Äî he was able to provide an \\"inside scoop\\" for the first issue of F&M.; Another concept was born with the first edition, when a copy of the review for Tobruk was sent to the actual developer of the game for fact checking and it was decided to publish his reply word for word. The technique of having developers respond in print to reviews, in the same issue, would be repeated many times over the years. The title \\"Fire & Movement\\" comes from a standard military expression, and MacGowan noticed it as a chapter heading in a military manual and decided it would be more appropriate and recognizable than Arquebus.\\"F&M;'s First Decade\\", by Rodger B. MacGowan and Friedrich G. Helfferich as told to Stephen M. Newberg. Fire & Movement 10th Anniversary Issue, Number 49 (July/Aug 1986) Reception Fire & Movement won the Charles S.

It was included in his Opus 23 set of ten preludes, despite having been written two years earlier than the other nine. Rachmaninoff himself premiered the piece in Moscow on February 10, 1903, along with Preludes No. 1 and 2 from Op. 23.  Structure  The Prelude's taut structure is in ternary form, consisting of an opening \\"A\\" section with punctuated sixteenth-note chords (marked: Alla marcia, march), a more lyrical and melancholy \\"B\\" section with sweeping arpeggios in the left hand (marked: Poco meno mosso), a transition into the original tempo, and a recapitulation of the initial march. The Alla marcia section is in itself in ternary ABA form. Within the first three measures of the Prelude, Rachmaninoff introduces the unifying factors of the piece (notwithstanding the Poco meno mosso section). First, the chordal march of measure one; second, the fragment on the second half of the beat in measure two; third, the fragment on the second half of beat two in measure three. Measures 1‚Äì9 expand on the march theme. Following a cadence in the dominant, the section repeats in measures 10‚Äì16 with slight alterations and concludes in a G minor perfect cadence. The \\"B\\" subsection of the Alla marcia section (measures 17‚Äì24) mirrors the rhythm of the first measure, presenting a sequence of related chords beginning with E. In contrast to the Alla marcia, the \\"B\\" section introduces a lyrical chordal melody over an extended arpeggiated figure. Beginning in measure 35, a two-measure phrase is repeated and then serially extended in measures 39‚Äì41. A counter melody appears at measure 42 in the middle voice, intensifying the passage. Following the middle section, the Prelude transitions to a recapitulation of the march section by gradual increases in tempo and dynamics. The section uses chromatically upward moving chords following embellished diminished seventh figures. Finally, the piece ends in a highly original way: a short arpeggiated run to a high G, marked pianissimo. } ew Staff = \\"LeftHand\\" { \\\\clef bass \\\\autoBeamOff \\\\key g\\\\minor a,,8 r r r d16 ( [ e fis8] ) } >> } author=Measure 84 }}  Recordings  Emil Gilels played this prelude at a front in World War II, in support for the Soviet military forces fighting in the war.

Filmed over four months in 1995, Connolly takes the viewer on a scenic and informative tour of Australia, a country he first visited in the 1970s, intercut with scenes from his stand-up comedy act at various venues around the country. The tour takes in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Alice Springs and Fraser Island. On the way, Connolly also experiences and demonstrates several Australian customs, traditions, and attractions, including swimming with the dolphins in Perth, eating a pie floater in Adelaide, and visiting several museums and galleries, most of which feature some form of Aboriginal art. The DVD box-set of the series, released in 2004, contains two discs, each featuring four episodes of the tour. The opening titles feature an Aboriginal man playing a didgeridoo in the foreground, while in the background Connolly drives his Harley-Davidson trike (on which he travels throughout the series, with a New South Wales registration label attached to its rear, which to some may look like a learner's plate) towards and past the camera. The first disc focuses mainly on the southeastern coast of Australia, with Connolly visiting such places as Melbourne, Sydney and Newcastle, while the second disc focuses on Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and rural Australia. Episode list Episode 1: Connolly introduces himself and his tour with a preview of where he and his team will be heading and what they will be seeing. He kicks off his tour in October in Sydney by visiting the Harbour Bridge and giving a history of its construction and opening. While on the bridge he points out the Opera House where he performed during his stay in the city. He then takes a tour of the harbour on The Bounty, the ship used in the 1984 film of the same name featuring Mel Gibson. The boat sails past Goat Island, at which point Connolly tells the story of Charlie Anderson, a prisoner who was banished to the island. The boat eventually drops Connolly off at Doyles Restaurant in Watsons Bay, where he chats with its owner, Peter Doyle. Next, he visits the Financial District of Sydney, where he goes underground (via a \\"personhole cover\\") to visit the water-tunnels where the convicts were sent to work. The episode concludes with Connolly taking a seaplane trip to visit famous Australian artist, Ken Done. Episode 2 starts with Connolly visiting La Perouse, Botany Bay, where Captain Cook first landed on Australian soil in 1770. He tells the story of how close Australia came to being a French colony, if not for Arthur Phillip's landing ahead of French explorer, Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, and performs a French version of \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" (\\"Dancing Matilde\\") for effect. Connolly then travels south-west to visit Australia's capital, Canberra. There he tells the history of the architecture and layout of the city, for which they had a competition that was won by a man named Walter Burley Griffin. Connolly tours the various embassies for each country in the city. He visits the original Australian Government House, built in 1927, and tells the story of the Aboriginal protests outside the house in the same year for recognition as a race. A tent-city was set up by the Aboriginal people, which was eventually driven away. A permanent tent- city was then set up by the Aboriginal people as their own embassy, and it still exists today. Other embassies he visits are the Chinese embassy, French embassy, the Indonesian embassy (where he gets \\"interrogated\\" by an officer, who was clearly a fan of the Scot, for filming on an embassy street), and a jocular \\"Pygmy embassy\\", which was actually an electrical box. Connolly then heads back to Sydney to be interviewed on the Today program. While in Sydney, he takes a walk along the harbour, watching and listening to various street performers, including a man named Johannes O'rinda who whistles classical music. The episode ends with Connolly climbing to the top of the Opera House, from where he tells the story of J√∏rn Utzon, who designed the building's exterior. Episode 3: Connolly travels to Newcastle first, stopping en route at Nobby's Point in order to view the city on the horizon and talk about the coal mining industry in the area. From there he goes trout or salmon fishing on Stockton Beach, home of the famous shipwreck. He then rides his trike back to Sydney, making a detour to visit a graveyard in Maitland. There he visits the resting place of Les Darcy, a young Australian boxer who chose to visit America to fight new opponents rather than be conscripted for World War I. He died from influenza, at which point his body was brought back to Australia. This is the first of a few cemetery visits during the tour, due to Connolly's enjoyment of the stories they tell about people's lives. When he arrives back in Sydney, he takes the viewing audience on a walk from his hotel to his gig at the Opera House. Along the way he reads from various brass plaques along the eastern side of Circular Quay, with famous Australian quotes and poems engraved on them. Some of the writings he recites include \\"My Country\\" by Dorothea Mackellar, \\"Unreliable Memoirs\\" by Clive James, a poem about pie by Barry Humphries, and a quote by Germaine Greer about being homeless until Aborigines are seen as the rightful owners of Australia. Due to the nature of his walking to his show, Connolly meets and interacts with many of the members of his soon-to-be audience. He then heads to the Brett Whiteley Studio, which features many of the late artist's sculptures and paintings, many of which feature small birds and lifelike 3D sculptures. Connolly chats with Whiteley's ex-wife, Wendy Whiteley, about how her then husband bet him $100 to do two consecutive gigs without repeating a joke, which he successfully accomplished. The episode finishes with Connolly viewing more art from the studio. Episode 4: The Big Yin rides south to Melbourne, Victoria. His first stop is the West Gate Bridge, where he tells the story about the bridge collapse in October 1970, causing the loss of life of 35 men. He then travels into the city and stops at Melbourne Gaol, where outlaw Ned Kelly was hung. Inside the jail, Connolly notes the practice of phrenology which was rife in the era of Kelly. He also points out the various torture devices that were used, including a flogging machine, kidney belt, Cat o' nine tails and anti-masturbation gloves. The final thing he points out is the Ned Kelly shrine in the prison, which documents the fall of the man and holds his personal journal. After returning to downtown Melbourne, Connolly makes his way on foot to his gig from his hotel. On his way he notes the electronic birdsong that is piped through speakers in the city as ambiance . He next heads to Mornington Peninsula, where he tells the story of ex-Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who mysteriously disappeared while swimming off the peninsula. Connolly then returns to the city and boards a tram to travel through the city. He eventually hops off the tram and walks through the city, pointing out some beautification sculptures and appreciates some street-performers along the way. Another interesting artpiece he demonstrates is a metaphorical time- machine that represents the past, present and future. The episode finishes with Connolly heading to William Ricketts' Sanctuary, where he comments on some of Ricketts' artwork, most of which featured lifelike Aboriginal sculptures which represent the soul and culture of the people. Episode 5: Connolly makes his way to Adelaide in South Australia. He visits a Jimmy Pike gallery where he views an Aboriginal dance and Aboriginal artwork. He tells the story of Pike, a famous Aboriginal artist who learned to paint in prison as a means of therapy. His next visit is to Adelaide Zoo, where he visits his favourite animal, the Hairy-nosed wombat. He then sets off to his gig from his hotel, taking the viewers on a tour along the way. He points out the local casino, SKYCITY Adelaide, and the artistic layout for the ventilation of the South Australian Government House, before arriving at his gig next door. Later, he travels into the city to buy a pie floater. Perth is his next stop. He describes the Western Australian capital as \\"the most isolated capital in the world\\". He describes the aboriginal belief that the Swan River was carved out by the rainbow serpent. He then visits Kings Park where there are gum trees planted along the side of the road in dedication of every Australian man and woman who lost his or her life in war. He then travels out to Rottnest Island, originally named Wadjemup. He takes a bike ride along the coast of the island until he stops by some tea trees. While describing them, some quokkas come out and pay him a visit. He then heads out into the ocean to go swimming with the dolphins. While in Perth, Connolly celebrates his 53rd birthday. His sister, Flo, and his eldest daughter, Cara, have been flown out to visit him as a surprise. The episode ends with Connolly visiting The Pinnacles, a petrified forest in Nambung National Park, north of Perth, where he does one of his world-famous nudey-dances. Episode 6: Connolly starts by heading to Brisbane, Queensland. He drives around the city on his trike, giving a commentary on the city's political history and notable landmarks. He points out the local town hall where he was attacked by a Scottish-Australian prison officer during a gig on his first tour of Australia. He then takes a walk through a man-made rainforest in the city to his gig, pointing out the Nepal Peace Pagoda along the way. Next, he heads to the Caboolture Gliding Club on the outskirts of Brisbane to go flying in a glider. His pilot does several loops and twirls in the sky before bringing him back down, only to find out the battery ran out on the camera he took up. So he heads back up again to get the footage. Connolly then heads out to take a look at second-hand houses standing on pallets, available for sale alongside the highway. Once bought, they're placed on a truck or boat and sent to wherever the buyer wishes. He heads to a neighbourhood where several of these houses have been set up. Connolly flies to Fraser Island, the largest sand island in the world which lies off the coast of Queensland. He tells about the trees of the rainforest that were cut down and used around the world as piles, due to their incredible height and lack of branches. The rainforest eventually became a United Nations World Heritage Site and no further logging was permitted. Connolly's next destination is Lake McKenzie, where he goes for a quick swim and spots a turtle. He then takes a drive out to the eastern beach of the island. While driving, he talks about some dingos he saw while staying on the island, and how they're the purest-bred dingoes in Australia. He arrives at the beach and the episode ends with him playing his banjo while the sun sets over the ocean. Episode 7: Connolly travels to Coober Pedy in the hot, dusty heart of Australia. He talks about the town's Opal mining background and later visits one of the mines himself. He describes how Aboriginal Australians don't like to get involved with mining because of their closely held beliefs that their version of the Devil lives underground and lures people to their deaths with shiney, desirable stones. Billy then visits a house that was built by digging out a man-made cave and furnishing it beautifully. It was made by a woman named \\"Faye\\" and includes an underground heated swimming pool. Next he visits the famous Dingo fence, which at 5600 kilometres, is the longest fence in the world. Coober Pedy golf course is the next stop and it is notable due to the course being made completely of sand. Golfers using the course carry around a square foot of astro turf and put their ball on it to take each shot. Connolly then rides to Alice Springs for a short visit and passes along the usually dry Todd River. He talks about the annual boat race they hold along the river which sees people make boats with no bottom and teams run along the river carrying their boats. He jokes about the fact that these races have been cancelled on occasion due to water being in the river after rainfall. Billy then goes into the outback and makes bread called Damper and tea over a fire. He then plays a song on the Autoharp to celebrate his outback culinary success. The episode finishes with Billy taking in the sights at Ayers Rock. Episode 8: Begins with Connolly in Darwin, Northern Territory and takes his trike to the Adelaide River. Here he takes a boat trip to find Saltwater crocodiles and shows how the crocodiles leap up out of the water to reach bait at the end of a pole held by the river guide. Billy then takes a plane ride to the Bathurst and Melville Islands just north of Darwin. He meets the local indigenous people and talks about their culture and beliefs. The locals take Billy hunting for Mud Crabs in a Mangrove and later to eat worms that are found in the bark of trees. He then follows a guide called Sydney into a wooded area to try some Bush Tucker. Billy then visits the Tiwi design centre to see wood carvings and paintings and goes into the workshop to see the locals painting intricate, colourful patterns on shells and weaving dining table furniture. Next Billy returns to the mainland to a place called Shady Camp to do some Barramundi fishing but his trip is cut short by a thunder storm. When the storm passes he returns to the boat and catches a \\"frying pan sized\\" Barramundi and later cruises along the tranquil river during a beautiful sunset. Finally Billy returns to Sydney to talk about the tour now that it has come to an end and what they hoped to achieve during the filming. The series ends with a montage of video clips over a recording of Billy singing an extended version of the title music. Book A book () accompanying the series was also issued. Ghost-written by Connolly's manager's PA Claire Walsh and featuring photographs from Nobby Clark, along with screenshots from the televised series, it is dedicated to \\"the two Australians who have had the most profound impact on my life: my wife Pamela and the artist Brett Whiteley.\\" The book isn't, as Connolly writes in the introduction, a travel guide ‚Äî \\"I wanted to show you my Australia\\".

He claimed to be an illegitimate son of Chlothar IAlfons Dopsch, The Economic and Social Foundations of European Civilization, (Routledge, 2006), 199. and, with the financial support of the Emperor Maurice,J.B. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene, Vol. II, (Adamant Media Corp., 2000), 162. took some major cities in southern Gaul, such as Poitiers and Toulouse, which belonged to Guntram, king of Burgundy, a legitimate son of Chlothar I. Guntram marched against him, calling him nothing more than a miller's son and named him 'Ballomer'. Gundovald fled to Comminges and Guntram's army set down to besiege the citadel (now known as Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges). The siege was successful, Gundovald's support drained away quickly and he was handed over by the besieged to be executed. The sole source for Gundovald is Gregory of Tours, who wrote about the events in his 'Histories', books 6 and 7. Gundovald was never king of Aquitaine as is sometimes thought; there was no such separate kingdom at the time. While his main backers were magnates of Austrasia, the Byzantine support consisted of treasure to buy followers and it is probable that Gundovald spent time in Constantinople before setting off to conquer parts of Gaul. The usage of 'ballomer', a Frankish (possibly offensive) word of which the meaning is not known, is one of the first instances of the mentioning of a Germanic word in a literary source.  Early Life  Gundovald was born in Gaul. According to Gregory of Tours, he was educated with great care and wore his hair long in the style of the Frankish kings, At some point, his mother presented him to Childebert I claiming that his father, Chlothar I, hated him. Childebert I had no sons of his own, so he took Gundovald as his own. In response, Chlothar I demanded that Gundovald be presented to him. Chlothar I claimed that Gundovald was not his son. After Chlothar I's death, Charibert I received Gundovald. However, he was again summoned by Sigebert I who denied his legitimacy once more and cut his hair off. Gundovald was sent to Cologne. Despite his rejection by two Merovingian kings, there is good reason to believe that Gundovald was a genuine offspring of Chlothar I. For a start, he was treated as a royal by two family members. Furthermore, his upbringing was that of a member of royalty. Gregory of Tours himself may have believed he was a child of Chlothar I due to the fact that during his narrative he mentions that Radegund of Poitiers and Ingitrude of Tours can attest to Gundovald's legitimacy. Gregory thought of the former as a saint and thought highly of the latter while composing book seven of the histories, so he likely would have believed their word about Gundovald. After escaping Cologne, Gundovald went to Italy, where he was received by the Eastern Roman general Narses.The general might have wanted to establish him as governor of the Frankish provinces in Italy; Liguria, Venetia and the Cottian Alps. Installed there, Gundovald could have possibly rallied the local inhabitants to fight off the Lombard invasions. Narses' plans for Gundovald did not come to fruition as he fell from grace and was replaced by Longinus. Nevertheless during his time in Italy, Gundovald married and had children, before moving to Constantinople, where he stayed until his return to Gaul.  The Gundovald Affair  The reason for Gundovald's return to Gaul is not clear. Gundovald himself claims in the Histories that he was invited back by the Austrasian magnate Guntram Boso, who travelled to Constantinople. However, Guntram Boso himself denied this when confronted by Guntram of Burgundy and suggested Duke Mummolus had invited him back. Regardless, upon his return to Gaul, he was received in Marseilles by Bishop Theodore and subsequently he set off to join Duke Mummolus at Avignon. However, Gundovald was soon forced to flee to an island in the Mediterranean after Guntram Boso arrested Bishop Theodore for introducing a foreigner to Gaul. The Bishop Epiphanius was also implicated in the alleged plot to invite Gundovald back, as he arrived in Marseilles at the same time as him. Gundovald later returned to Gaul again and stayed with Mummolus in Avignon. Accompanied by the Duke and also another called Desiderius, Gundovald soon set off to the district of Limoges, where he was raised up as king on a shield at the tomb of Saint Martin. Gregory writes, as he was carried round the tomb for third time, he stumbled and struggled to stay upright. Following on from these events, Gundovald made a progress through the neighbouring cities. He then planned to move to Poitiers, but was reluctant to do so because he heard an army was being raised against him. Gundovald also asked for an oath of allegiance to Childebert II, his supposed nephew, in all the territories that had previously belonged to Sigibert I. This reinforces the idea that an Austrasian faction was behind Gundovald's return and revolt. Gundovald also demanded an oath of allegiance to himself in all the territories that had belonged to Chilperic I and Guntram of Burgundy. He then moved on to Angoul√™me, where he received the oath there and gave bribes to its chief citizens. Then Gundovald moved to P√©rigueux, where he persecuted the Bishop for not having received him with due honour. Next, he marched on Toulouse and sent messengers to its Bishop Magnulf, but the inhabitants of the city prepared to resist the supposed pretender. However, when they saw the size of Gundovald's army, they opened the gates and let his forces in. After the discussions with the Bishop went wrong, Magnulf was prodded with spears, punched, kicked, tied up with rope and banished from his own city Gundovald then moved on from Toulouse and was pursued by an army made up of the inhabitants of Tours and Poitevins. He decided to go Bordeaux, where he tried to take a finger bone of Saint Sergius to aid his cause. The bone was broken in the process. The revolt subsequently established a new Bishop of Dax and nullified some of Chilperic's decrees. Gundovald soon sent two messengers to Guntram demanding the portion of Chlothar I's realm that was rightfully his. Guntram stretched the messengers, until they admiited that Gundovald had been asked to accept kingship by Childebert II's leaders. As a result of this, Guntram warned Childebert II not to trust his advisers, before accepting him as his heir.  The Siege of Comminges  With Guntram's army approaching, Gundovald soon crossed the Garonne and made for Comminges or Convenae in the foothills of the Pyrenees. The town itself was defended by a 674 metre perimeter wall, so Gundovald decided to make his stand here. When he arrived in Comminges, Gundovald claimed that he had been invited by all those who dwell in Childebert II's realm and ordered the inhabitants to bring food and supplies inside the wall. Furthermore, he told them to hold out for reinforcements. Gundovald also told the men of Convenae to sally forth and fight, but when the citizens of the town were out, Gundovald ordered the gates to be shut on them and the seizure of their possessions. When the siege had begun, Guntram's men tried to undermine the moral of the defenders. Men climbed to the top of the Matacan, the only highpoint within hailing distance to insult Gundovald. They made reference to his nickname ballomer, his painting skills and the cutting of his hair by Chlothar I and Sigibert I. Gundovald went on the ramparts and answered back to the attackers. Meanwhile, the siege engines brought by Guntram's army were proving ineffective, so Leudgisel, who was in charge of the siege, ordered the construction of new ones. The constructed siege machines mainly consisted of battering rams, with the aim of knocking down holes in the walls. As Guntram's men approached the walls they were bombarded by stones, as well as flaming barrels of pitch and fat. However, not all the defenders believed Comminges could hold. Duke Bladast, who supported Gundovald, tried to escape the city by setting fire to the church-house as a distraction. Guntram's forces were also constructing an agger, a great ramp or mound- opposite the east wall. With this in mind, the besiegers soon sent messengers to Duke Mummolus and asked him to acknowledge Guntram as his true overlord. Together with Bishop Sagittarius and other supporters of Gundovald, Mummolus went to the cathedral, where they all took an oath to hand over Gundovald to his enemies. When the group confronted Gundovald, they suggested that he should try and make peace with Guntram. According to Gregory, Gundovald knew he was being betrayed. Regardless, he left Comminges anyway. Now outside of the town, Ullo, a man of Guntram, pushed Gundovald over and thrust a lance at him. Gundovald survived, but Boso, one of Guntram's men, threw a stone at him. The stone hit Gundovald in the head and killed him. The next day the gates of the town were opened and Guntram's men slaughtered all the common people, while all the buildings, including churches, were put to the flame and destroyed. Nevertheless, Gundovald was dead and his revolt was over. ReferencesFurther reading *Bachrach, Bernard S.

The fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane of the annual Atlantic hurricane season, Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and initially moved very slowly to the northeast. Early forecasts suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to its south as a Category 1 hurricane on September 8. After moving away from the island, the storm entered a region with cooler sea surface temperatures and unfavorable wind shear, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical on September 10. The extratropical remnant was later absorbed by a larger weather system. The hurricane caused no structural damage while tropical, although it generated rip currents in combination with other storms that killed one person off the New Jersey coast. Nate dropped light rainfall and produced gusty winds on the island of Bermuda. The remnants of hurricanes Nate and Maria contributed to heavy rainfall in parts of Scotland and later Western Norway, triggering a mudslide that killed one person. Canadian Navy ships en route to the US Gulf Coast, carrying relief supplies to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were delayed while trying to avoid Nate and Hurricane Ophelia. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 30 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean, maintaining a vigorous area of convection along the wave axis. By September 1 most of the deep convection had been stripped away by southwesterly wind shear. Despite this, the wave remained well-defined as it continued west-northwest. The wave split into two pieces; the northern portion passed between the Leeward Islands and Hurricane Maria on September 3, while the southern portion moved into the Caribbean Sea. On September 4, the northern portion of the wave began to interact with an upper-level low pressure system and an elongated trough that was located between Bermuda and the Leeward Islands‚Äîthe same trough which contributed to the development of Hurricane Ophelia. As a result of the low wind shear, convection redeveloped and organized along the wave axis. Convective banding formed around a broad surface low. It is estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on September 5\\\\. At the time it was located approximately to the south-southwest of Bermuda. Upon being designated, Tropical Depression Fifteen developed deep convection close to, and to the east of, the center of circulation. At the same time, banding features became better organized. Later on September 5, the overall cloud pattern improved while thunderstorm activity condensed and deepened within the increasingly well-defined circulation. Just six hours after being designated as a tropical depression, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; it was given the name Nate by the National Hurricane Center. Over the following two days, Nate drifted slowly northeastward towards Bermuda. Within the early hours of September 6, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak steering pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over The Bahamas. Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent outflow surrounding the storm. Late on September 6 a developing banding eye feature became evident. Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTC on September 7, as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or merged with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it did. The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually opened into a broad trough as a shortwave trough approached from the northwest. The larger trough slowly became elongated in a northeast‚Äìsouthwest manner late on September 7\\\\. At the same time, the shortwave trough moved southward along the west side of the other trough. The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad trough caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h) late on September 8 as it passed 120 miles (205 km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds remained well offshore. While at peak intensity, the storm maintained a well-organized and \\"impressive\\" convective pattern. Soon after the storm peaked in strength, increasing wind shear and dry air caused Nate to weaken back into a tropical storm later on September 9. Satellite imagery showed that the cloud pattern began to rapidly deteriorate. The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1800 UTC on September 9 and continued to weaken as wind shear increased in association with an approaching trough and a related cold front. By late on September 9, all of the already limited convective activity was confined to the eastern semicircle, leaving the low-level center exposed. The storm was reduced to a swirl of low-level clouds just hours later. Nate became extratropical the next day before becoming absorbed by a larger system by 0000 UTC on September 13, to the north-northeast of the Azores.  Impact, records, and naming  alt=Satellite image of a tropical storm. An eye feature is invisible at this point. A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda early on September 7, and later that day a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch superseded it. However, the storm did not reach the island, so the warnings were canceled as the storm moved away September 8. Four cruise ships left the island ahead of schedule, and flights were canceled in anticipation of Nate. The outer bands of Nate brushed Bermuda with sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and widespread showers. Gusts were higher, peaking at roughly 50 mph (80 km/h). Less than 1 inch (25 mm) of rain was recorded at Bermuda International Airport. Damage in Bermuda was minimal. Two ships reported tropical storm-force winds in association with the storm: the Maersk New Orleans, to the north of the storm's center, and a ship with the call sign WCZ858 to the east-southeast. Rip currents from Nate and the more distant Maria killed one and injured another in New Jersey; several others were caught in rip currents, though they were able to escape. In the Carolinas, Nate also contributed to heightened seas, though this time in combination with Hurricane Ophelia and persistent unrelated northeasterly winds. A buoy just offshore Cape Fear recorded waves up to . Tropical energy from the remnants of Nate and Maria merged to form a broad storm system that would track toward parts of Europe. The mid-latitude cyclone produced a day of heavy rains across the Scottish Highlands that included a 24-hour precipitation total of on the Isle of Skye. As it continued north, the storm also dropped torrential rainfall over Western Norway. The region suffered extensive flooding and mudslides, including one that killed one person and injured nine more. Although the remnants of Nate and Maria avoided England, they broke a streak of above- average temperatures in the region, filtering down much cooler Arctic air. In places, this led to the first frost of the winter season. Temperatures down to were recorded following the influx of colder air, with readings below freezing as far south as Hertfordshire. Four Canadian Navy ships headed to the Gulf Coast of the United States, carrying relief supplies to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and Ophelia. The convoy included a destroyer, two frigates, and an icebreaker, and developed a plan to travel between the two hurricanes to minimize damage to their cargo. Anticipating rough seas and gusty winds even with the altered course, crews secured onboard supplies which included generators, chainsaws, diapers, and cots. The genesis of Tropical Storm Nate continued the unprecedented levels of tropical activity during the 2005 hurricane season; when it developed on September 5, it was the earliest in any season that the fourteenth named tropical cyclone formed, surpassing the previous record held by an unnamed storm during the 1936 season. This record was later broken in 2020 when Tropical Storm Nana formed on September 1, four days earlier.

The bridge handles approximately 279,490 vehicle crossings per year and forms a border crossing on the International Boundary. It connects with Route 205 in New Brunswick and Route 161 and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Maine, also forming the northern terminus of US 1\\\\. Since it is an international bridge, the Canadian portion of the structure is the responsibility of the Province of New Brunswick, while the American portion is operated by the State of Maine. The bridge was built in 1929‚Äì30 as a replacement for an existing cable ferry and a cable suspension footbridge. The bridge has three steel through-truss spans of each for a total length of . In 1995, the first pier from the New Brunswick abutment had major repairs done. In 1997, the steel members under the deck in the first 1.5 spans from the New Brunswick end were sandblasted, and then painted with a primer of inorganic zinc. In the same year, the downstream exterior stringers in these 1.5 spans were replaced. In 1998, the downstream concrete curb in the first 1.5 spans from the New Brunswick end was replaced. In 2000, the New Brunswick end concrete abutment underwent a major restoration.  Replacement  In January 2011, the Maine Department of Transportation imposed a 2.7 ton weight restriction on the bridge after advanced deterioration of the bridge on Maine's side was discovered during a routine inspection. On January 28, 2011, officials from New Brunswick and Maine announced plans to build a new bridge and demolish the existing structure. Construction began on the new bridge in 2012 and the estimated completion date is June 30, 2014. It is expected to cost $13.9 million. The new bridge opened on July 31, 2014. Demolition of the old bridge was underway by September 29, 2014. Border crossing The Fort Kent - Clair Border Crossing is at the Clair‚ÄìFort Kent Bridge on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. This crossing first opened in 1905 with the construction of a footbridge that traversed the Saint John River. A replacement for the steel bridge that was built in 1930 opened July 31, 2014.

It was founded in 1840 and served as New Zealand's first national capital until 1841, when the seat of government was moved to Auckland. The car ferry across the Bay of Islands, which provides the main access to Russell, runs between Okiato and Opua. The name Okiato comes from MƒÅori. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage translates ≈åkiato to \\"place of [a] receptacle for holding sacred objects\\" . History Plan of Russell (Okiato) Pomare, the local MƒÅori chief in the 1830s, sold land at Okiato to a British merchant and ship owner, Captain James Reddy Clendon, who settled there in 1832 and set up a trading station with partner Samuel Stephenson. Clendon became the first United States Consul for New Zealand in 1838 or 1839. When the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840, Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson instructed the Surveyor-General, Felton Mathew, to report on possible locations for a capital in the Bay of Islands. Clendon's property met the requirements for a good anchorage and immediate availability of land suitable for subdivision and on-sale to settlers. KororƒÅreka (present-day Russell) was discounted as it had insufficient available land, and locations such as Paihia and Kerikeri were bypassed for various reasons. Clendon wanted 23,000 pounds for the 1.24 km¬≤ of land, the house, two small cottages, a large store and other buildings. Hobson eventually secured it for 15,000 pounds. He changed its name from Okiato to Russell, in honour of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord John Russell. Hobson and his family moved there in May 1840 and officials, troops, workmen and immigrants took up residence in permanent or temporary buildings and tents. Mathew drew up ambitious plans for a town, but only one of the intended roads was ever built ‚Äì leading directly from the town hall to the town jail. A year later in 1841 New Zealand was established as a separate colony from New South Wales and Hobson moved the capital to Auckland and most of the Russell residents moved there too. A few officials lived on in the Government House at Russell but when it and the offices burned down in May 1842, they moved to KororƒÅreka leaving Russell virtually deserted. KororƒÅreka was part of the Port of Russell and gradually became known as Russell also. In January 1844 Governor Robert FitzRoy officially designated KororƒÅreka as part of the township of Russell. Now the name Russell applies only to the erstwhile KororƒÅreka while Okiato has resumed its original name. Demographics The statistical area of Russell Peninsula, which at 26 square kilometres is larger than this locality, covers the peninsula but not the town of Russell itself. It had a population of 606 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 81 people (15.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 114 people (23.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 267 households. There were 315 males and 291 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.08 males per female. Of the total population, 60 people (9.9%) were aged up to 15 years, 51 (8.4%) were 15 to 29, 285 (47.0%) were 30 to 64, and 210 (34.7%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 90.6% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 12.9% MƒÅori, 0.0% Pacific peoples, 3.5% Asian, and 2.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 33.7, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 58.4% had no religion, 28.2% were Christian, and 4.5% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 126 (23.1%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 93 (17.0%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $25,600. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 201 (36.8%) people were employed full-time, 81 (14.8%) were part-time, and 15 (2.7%) were unemployed.

But Mason's creator, Erle Stanley Gardner ‚Äî whose own legal career bore similarities to Ehrlich's ‚Äî did not make any such statement. For much of his career, Ehrlich was lead attorney for the San Francisco Police Officer's Association.

Publication history History of the DC Universe was an attempt to summarize the new history of the DC Universe to establish what was canonical after Crisis on Infinite Earths reformed the multiverse into a single universe. In the original planning of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the History would have formed the final two issues, following the destruction of the Multiverse at the beginning of time, but this was changed. History of the DC Universe had been one of the working titles for Crisis on Infinite Earths.Crisis on Infinite Earths Compendium, pg. 4, Crisis on Infinite Earths: The Absolute Edition. The loose plotline of the series involves the character Harbinger chronicling the past, present, and future of the post-Crisis DC Universe. The history is mostly told through one- and two- page splash pages, accompanied by brief prose. At the end of the series, Harbinger places the history in a capsule and launches it into space. In the subsequent series Millennium, this history is intercepted by the Manhunters and used against Earth's superheroes. Portfolio The Next Men characters made a prototypical appearance as \\"Freaks\\" in a lithography plate that was published within the History of the DC Universe Portfolio in 1986. Writer/artist John Byrne had originally pitched the series to DC Comics but it never surfaced there. With some changes, Byrne changed the concept to fit in with his work on the graphic novel 2112, to become the John Byrne's Next Men series. Two characters from the \\"Freaks\\" artwork somewhat retained their physical looks and became the lead characters of the Next Men series: heroine Jasmine and villain Aldus Hilltop.

Robinson and James Cagney. It is the only time Robinson and Cagney made a film together, despite being the two leading actors, mainly portraying gangsters, at Warner Bros. studios throughout the 1930s. Smart Money was shot after Robinson's signature film Little Caesar had been released and during the filming of Cagney's breakthrough masterpiece The Public Enemy, which is how Cagney came to play a supporting role. The writing duo of Lucien Hubbard and Joseph Jackson were nominated at the 4th Academy Awards in the now defunct Best Story category. Plot Nick Venizelos (Robinson), a prosperous small-town barber, provides his customers with gambling in his back room. He is so lucky that one suggests he go to the big city to take on famous gambler named Hickory Short. Not lacking in self-confidence, Nick puts up half of the $10,000 stake himself, while the others raise the rest. He leaves the shop under the supervision of his assistant, Jack (Cagney), and takes the train into the city. He learns from Marie, the pretty blonde working at the hotel cigar stand, where Hickory is holding his illegal, high-stakes poker game. Nick sits down at the game, but loses all his money. Later, however, he sees a newspaper article reporting that the real Hickory Short has just been released from prison far away in Florida. The man he thought was Hickory is actually conman Sleepy Sam (Ralf Harolde), and Marie is his girlfriend and accomplice. When Nick foolishly tries to get his money back, Sleepy Sam and the other fake poker players beat him up. After he gets out of the hospital, he vows to get revenge. Nick goes back to barbering and raises another stake. Six months later, he tracks down Sleepy Sam and his gang in another city. He proposes a one-on-one game, each man putting up $50,000 and playing until one man has all the money. Sam accepts. Nick insists on sending out for fresh decks of cards, just to be safe. When Nick wins and tries to leave, the con artists reach for their guns, but Jack and another man burst in with their guns already drawn. Nick then gloats, pointing out that he simply cheated better than Sam by using shaved cards. Nick becomes very successful. He finally gets to play the real Hickory Short; a Walter Winchell column reports the rumor that Nick beat Hickory to the tune of $300,000. Nick becomes the king of illegal gambling in the city, with Jack as his right-hand man. However, he still has a weakness for women, particularly blondes. As they are driving by, they are stopped and asked to take a young woman (Evalyn Knapp) who has been fished half drowned out of the river to the hospital. Irene revives during the ride, but Nick insists she stay at his mansion until she is fully recovered, over the very suspicious Jack's protests. Eventually, she is so touched by Nick's kindness, she confesses she is fleeing from a charge of blackmail, but he is unconcerned. Nick is so brazen that public outrage puts pressure on District Attorney Black (an uncredited Morgan Wallace), who is up for re-election soon. He has Irene picked up. Black threatens to prosecute her unless she cooperates in incriminating Nick, but she refuses at first. Finally, he gets her to agree to put a racing form in Nick's coat, which will be enough to put Nick in jail for a month. Jack finds out, but when he tries to warn his friend, Nick becomes furious and knocks him to the floor. The police raid the illegal casino, and Black arrests Nick. Then they discover that Jack is dead. Aghast, Irene begs Nick for forgiveness, which he generously gives. He is sentenced to ten years. As he is boarding the train to go to prison, he offers to bet that he will be out in five. CastProduction The film was directed by Alfred E. Green and released by Warner Brothers.

The story is about Mabel, a five-year-old girl who helps the King of all the lizards and is rewarded with the ability to converse with animals. She also meets giants and brownies. Editions The first edition was published under the pseudonym of \\"Rafford Pyke\\" with illustrations by Melanie Elisabeth Norton. This version was published on two continents in 1897 (with an 1896 copyright). The copyright (in the US volume only) is to Dodd Mead, and the publishers are \\"University Press, John Wilson and Son, Cambridge, MA.\\" in the US and \\"James Bowden, 10 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London\\" in the UK. Both are authored under the pseudonym \\"Rafford Pyke\\", and both contain the Melanie Elisabeth Norton illustrations (editions with the Harry Rountree illustrations are not first editions). Volume IV, No. 1 of The Bookman A Literary Journal (September, 1896), of which Peck was an editor, contains an article, beginning on page 300, by \\"Harry Thurston Peck\\" titled \\"The New Child and Its Picture Books.\\" In this article, Peck (aka \\"Rafford Pyke\\") laments that illustrations in children's books are becoming so realistic that little room exists to engage the child's imagination to complete the image. He cites a number of good and bad examples and spends most of the rest of the article presenting and discussing the illustrations of Melanie Elisabeth Norton for The Adventures of Mabel by \\"Rafford Pyke\\". He even includes a photograph of Miss Norton. Thereafter, Miss Norton's illustrations appear frequently in issues of The Bookman edited by Peck. The Bookman A Literary Journal contains a significant number of articles by \\"Rafford Pyke\\" (aka Peck), in addition to the many contributions Peck provided under his own name. Mr. Peck used Melanie Elisabeth (Norton) Leonard's illustrations in Hilda and the Wishes, copyrighted and published in 1907. Mabel also appears in Hilda and the Wishes (1907). The Adventures of Mabel and Hilda and the Wishes were the only children's books written by Harry Thurston Peck. The same original version of The Adventures of Mabel, containing the Norton illustrations, was published as late as 1912, but under the author's real name: Harry Thurston Peck. Two versions of The Adventures of Mabel were released by Dodd Mead in 1916, two years after his death, each containing new illustrations by Harry Rountree: the first was small and contained only black and white, but still very detailed illustrations, while the second was a larger book and contained very detailed color illustrations in addition to the black and whites included in the first. A 1963 version, illustrated by Meg Wohlberg, contained an altogether new set of detailed illustrations. The most recent printing of The Adventures of Mabel, from Greenhouse Publishing, contains the Rountree illustrations. In popular culture The Adventures of Mabel was mentioned in the television show Better Call Saul as a book that Chuck and Jimmy bonded over in their youth.

Who's Who in American Education, 1928, p. 63. He is the first person whose body was cryopreserved after legal death, and who remains preserved at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.  Cryonic preservation  In June 1965, Ev Cooper‚Äôs Life Extension Society (LES) offered the opportunity to preserve one person free of charge, stating that \\"the Life Extension Society now has primitive facilities for emergency short term freezing and storing our friend the large homeotherm (man). LES offers to freeze free of charge the first person desirous and in need of cryogenic suspension.\\" Bedford did not take this opportunity, however, but later used his own funds. Bedford suffered from kidney cancer that had later metastasized into his lungs, a condition that was untreatable at the time. Bedford left $100,000 to cryonics research in his will, but more than this amount was utilized by Bedford's wife and son in court, having to defend his will and his cryopreservation due to arguments created by other relatives. Bedford's body was frozen a few hours after his death due to natural causes related to his cancer. His body was preserved by Robert Prehoda (author of the 1969 book Suspended Animation), Dr. Dante Brunol (physician and biophysicist) and Robert Nelson (President of the Cryonics Society of California). Nelson then wrote a book about the subject titled We Froze the First Man. Compared to those employed by modern cryonics organizations, the use of cryoprotectants in Bedford's case was primitive. He was injected with a solution 15% dimethyl sulfoxide and 85% ringers solution, a compound once thought to be useful for long-term cryogenics, so it is unlikely that his brain was protected. Vitrification was not yet possible, further limiting the possibility of Bedford's eventual recovery. In his first suspended animation stages, his body was stored at Edward Hope's Cryo-Care facility in Phoenix, Arizona, for two years, then in 1969 moved to the Galiso facility in California. Bedford's body was moved from Galiso in 1973 to Trans Time near Berkeley, California, until 1977, before being stored by his son for many years. Bedford's body was maintained in liquid nitrogen by his family in southern California until 1982, when it was then moved to Alcor Life Extension Foundation, and has remained in Alcor's care to the present day. In May 1991, his body's condition was evaluated when he was moved to a new storage dewar. The examiners concluded that \\"it seems likely that his external temperature has remained at relatively low subzero temperatures throughout the storage interval.\\" The date of Bedford's cryopreservation, January 12, is now known as \\"James Bedford Day\\", and is celebrated every year.  Personal life  Bedford married twice. His first wife, Anna Chandler Rice, died in 1917, the same year she and Bedford were married. Bedford married his second wife, Ruby McLagan, in 1920. Bedford and McLagan had five children: Doris, Donald, Frances, Barbara and Norman. James Bedford enjoyed photography and extensive traveling.

He is a former Republican congressman. Lagomarsino began his service in the United States House of Representatives in 1974 and was re-elected every two years until 1992, when he was defeated for renomination by Michael Huffington. Prior to serving in the House, Lagomarsino served in the California State Senate from 1961 until 1974, and prior to that, he served as the mayor of Ojai, California. Early life A native of Ventura County, Lagomarsino served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. He is an alumnus of the University of California, Santa Barbara (1950) and of the Santa Clara University School of Law (1953). California State Senate In the California Senate, Lagomarsino's most significant legislative achievements included the Garrigus-Lagomarsino Act (1963), which authorized vocational education centers in each county of the State; the California Child Anti- Pornography Act (1969); the Marine Resources Protection Act (1970); the California Wild and Scenic Rivers legislation; the Jury Reform Act (1972); the Consumer Protection Act (1972), which authorized cities to create anti-fraud units; and the Welfare Reform Act (1973). By the time he was elected to the United States Congress, the senior ranking senator from Southern California and a member of the five person Senate Rules Committee, after having served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Wildlife. United States Congress In 1974, Congressman Charles Teague, of what was then California's 13th congressional district, where Lagomarsino resided, died suddenly. Lagomarsino was elected to replace Teague as the 13th district congressman in a special election in 1974. During his service as a United States Congressman, Lagomarsino was an active member of two major House Committees: the Foreign Affairs Committee, as the third-ranking Republican and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, as the second-ranking Republican. He was a Congressional Observer to the Geneva Arms Controls Talks and Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, which oversaw U.S. relations with Canada, Central America, and South America. He was also Chairman of the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, Co-Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Afghanistan, and a member of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Committee. In addition, Lagomarsino served as Chairman of the POW/MIA Task Force and was House author of a measure creating the Prisoner of War Medal. Lagomarsino made several trips abroad as a congressman. He toured South America, the Far East, the Pacific Region, the Soviet Union, and Europe numerous times, but held a particular interest in Southeast Asia; meeting with the Laos government in 1989 and, later, the Vietnamese government in 1990, to obtain information on American POW/MIA's in Southeast Asia. He toured the Panama Canal as part of President Carter‚Äôs diplomacy and was an observer to the Panama's national elections and Kuwait invasion under President Bush. Lagomarsino also attended annual interparliamentary conferences held in Mexico and on the European continent. During his service in Washington, Lagomarsino specialized in environmental concerns, foreign affairs (particularly Latin America), and illegal drug trafficking. He authored legislation which created the Channel Islands National Park, the Dick Smith Wilderness Area, the Los Padres National Forest, and co-authored the Drug War Bond Act and the Violent Crime and Drug Control Act. He was a leader in efforts to open overseas markets to U.S. products and to ban transfer of strategic goods or technology. Lagomarsino maintained a voting record of 99% and took pride in voting against all proposed congressional pay raises. Re-election defeat Prior to the 1992 congressional elections, a congressional reapportionment plan placed Lagomarsino's residence within the congressional district of fellow Republican Elton Gallegly. Rather than run against Gallegly, Lagomarsino chose to move to the 22nd District and run again for reelection there. He was challenged in the Republican primary by millionaire Michael Huffington, who went on to defeat Lagomarsino by nearly seven percentage points. California State University Channel Islands Lagomarsino was a long-time advocate of the establishment of a state college in his native Ventura County. His goal came to fruition in 2002, with the establishment of the California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI). A collection of papers, memorabilia and furniture Lagomarsino had previously donated to the Ventura satellite campus of the California State University, Northridge was transitioned to CSUCI. In 2002, the university's library formally established the Robert J. and Norma M. Lagomarsino Department of Archives and Special Collections. Post-politics As of 2010, Lagomarsino continued to be active, serving on numerous community boards in and around Santa Barbara County and Ventura County, and on the Board of the California Center for Public Policy. He and his wife Norma lived in Ventura, California, and they had three children and six grandchildren. The visitor's center at Channel Islands National Park is named after Lagomarsino.

It was founded by Alonzo Fowler Kempton, who started the company using money invested by local farmers. After two weeks, Charles Kerr, Alonzo's partner, completed the company's first policy, insuring a thresher for $600 at a premium of $24 for three years. The Wawanesa Insurance Executive Office building, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. A small room was rented above a local drugstore. The staff consisted of Alonzo Kempton, the secretary-manager, and Charles Kerr, the bookkeeper. Seven of the twenty original investors were named directors. Wawanesa issued its first policies without a premium payment because farmers didn't have cash until after harvest. Several years later, the company diversified its coverage to include building coverage. In 1901, Wawanesa moved to the Souris River valley, and the number of employees increased to five. By 1910, the company had become the largest fire insurance company in the country. During the Great Depression, the company expanded, fuelled by large cash reserves and new offices in Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, and Moncton - however, the company was forced to cut director's salaries by 20%, and on corporate visits, the company directors shared beds. The United States branch was established under the laws of California on May 23, 1974. In 2016, Wawanesa Insurance signed a multi year sponsorship deal with the Canadian Hockey League, Ontario Hockey League, and Quebec Major Junior Hockey League to become their Official Auto/Home Insurance Company.

He is a former Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from California, serving from 1969 to 1983. He is the son of former U.S. Senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. Early life Goldwater was born on July 15, 1938. He graduated from Staunton Military Academy in Staunton, Virginia in 1957. Goldwater attended the University of Colorado and graduated from Arizona State University in 1962. He then worked as a stockbroker, public relations executive and in import-export business before being elected to Congress. Political career Goldwater during his tenure in congress In April 1969, Goldwater ran his first race for Congress representing northern Los Angeles County. He won that race for the 91st Congress and was reelected for six consecutive terms. During his time in Washington Goldwater served on several committees such as the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, the Joint Committee on Energy, and the Committee on Science and Technology. During his tenure Goldwater drafted legislation that addressed issues that are still topics of debate today. The Privacy Act of 1974, which prevents the distribution of private information from government and businesses, is one of the best known laws of which he drafted. In 1980, Goldwater campaigned for family friend and Governor of California Ronald Reagan, who won the presidential election against Jimmy Carter. Goldwater would later publicly debate Reagan's son Ron Reagan, who did not support Goldwater's friend and then-California Republican gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger went on to win the 2003 recall election to replace Gray Davis as Governor of California. Goldwater speaking during the launch of in 1981 With his district merged with that of Bobbi Fiedler due to redistricting, Goldwater ran for the Republican nomination to the United States Senate in 1982.

Martin was born in Australia where he began his broadcasting career. He came to England on holiday in 1953 for the Coronation and received a call from the BBC the day before he was due to sail for Australia. He never used his return ticket home, and only twice went back to Australia in 1983 and 1993, on holiday. He performed his role on Grandstand from the programme's very first edition in 1958 until his death in 1995. Martin was well known for his intonation when reading the scores. It was clear from the way in which he presented the home or away team name, followed by number of goals, whether the result was a home win, an away win, a no-score draw or a score draw; this was important for the football pools results. He was succeeded by Tim Gudgin who also used the distinct BBC intonation. In addition to his role on Grandstand, Martin was a voice-over artist heard on Movietone newsreels.

Biography Utt was born in Tustin in Orange County. He attended public schools and Santa Ana Junior College. He worked in citrus processing, served in the California State Assembly from 1932 to 1936, and was an inheritance tax appraiser in the state controller's office during 1936 to 1952. In 1946, at the age of forty-seven, Utt graduated from the University of Southern California Law School, was admitted to the bar the next year, and practiced law in Santa Ana. In 1952, Utt was first elected to the 83rd Congress. He polled 106,972 votes (63%) against the Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin, who drew 62,779 votes (37%). Utt had no serious challengers in what became an increasingly \\"safe\\" seat for him. For instance, in the heavily Democratic year of 1958, he polled 152,855 votes (58%) to Democrat T. R. Boyett's 109,794 votes (42%). In 1962, when Richard M. Nixon lost the governorship to incumbent Democrat Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown, Sr., Utt won reelection with 133,737 (68.5%) to Democrat Burton Shamsky's 61,393 (31.5%). In the wake of Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat in 1964, Utt still polled 65 percent in his district. In 1966, when Ronald W. Reagan blocked a third term for \\"Pat\\" Brown, Utt received 73.1 percent in his district (his strongest showing ever). In 1968, when Nixon was elected president, Utt drew a similar vote of 72.5%. That turned out to have been his last election, for he died in office before completing the 1969-1971 term. Utt was an outspoken conservative; one of his unachieved goals was to remove the United States from the United Nations. Utt voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and voted present the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1963, he claimed that \\"a large contingent of barefooted Africans\\" might be training in Georgia as part of a United Nations military exercise to take over the United States. In 1963, he also claimed that African Americans might be training in Cuba to invade the United States.\\"1963\\", OC Almanac In 1964, he had been a strong supporter of fellow Republican Barry Goldwater for the presidency. Goldwater had also voted against the 1964 civil rights law on constitutional and libertarian grounds but later repudiated his position. In 1966, journalist Drew Pearson reported that Utt was one of a group of Congressman who had received the \\"Statesman of the Republic\\" award from Liberty Lobby for his \\"right-wing activities\\". He died at Bethesda Naval Hospital of a heart attack, which developed while he was attending church just 10 days shy of his 71st birthday. Utt is interred at Santa Ana Cemetery in Santa Ana. Utt was succeeded in the 35th Congressional District by fellow conservative Republican John G. Schmitz. Schmitz won the seat for a full term in the 1970 general election, aided in part by the presence of Governor Reagan, who was winning a second term. Schmitz polled 192,765 votes (67 percent) to Democrat Thomas B. Lenhart's 87,019 (30.7 percent). The turnout in the district continued to grow along with the Orange County population.

Biography A native of Dallas, Texas, Leonard graduated from Dallas Technical High formerly Dallas High School, then Texas A&M; University in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in agriculture. Commissioned in 1942 via the ROTC program at Texas A&M;, Leonard was serving as a platoon leader in Company C, 893rd Tank Destroyer Battalion, which was attached in October 1944 to support the 112th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division during that unit's assault on the Siegfried Line through the H√ºrtgen Forest area along the German-Belgian border. Between 4‚Äì6 November 1944, Leonard's company was heavily engaged in the fighting in and around the village of Kommerscheidt west of Schmidt. Throughout the three days, he repeatedly exposed himself to hostile fire. When all officers of the infantry unit his platoon was supporting became incapacitated, Leonard assumed command. Already seriously wounded in the arm on the first day, he refused medical evacuation to remain with his troops. On 6 November, a mortar round severed the remainder of his arm, and forced him to report to the aid station. Leonard was left behind with the other seriously wounded in the hopes that the Germans, who were about to overrun the American positions, would provide medical care, but he ordered the medic to place him in a concealed foxhole with a weapon, explaining that he did not want to be taken prisoner. His remains were found after the War in a field grave dug by the Germans. On 1 September 1945, Leonard posthumously received the Medal of Honor.

He was declared President of Haiti on 4 April 1843. He was forced from office by revolutionaries on 3 May 1844. Charles Rivi√®re-H√©rard was born in Port-Salut on 16 February 1789. Little about his early life is generally known, except that he fought with the revolutionaries against the French, and that he was an officer commanding a battalion of black troops, probably later in his military career. H√©rard was chief among the conspirators who ousted President Jean-Pierre Boyer during the 1843 Revolution. On 30 December of that same year, a Provisional Parliament of Haiti enacted a new Constitution, apparently without H√©rard's approval. Soon afterward, General H√©rard, who had the loyalty of the army, seized control of the government and declared himself President of Haiti. Soon after H√©rard's rise to power, the eastern half of Haiti, which at that time was Santo Domingo, staged a revolt. On 27 February 1844, rebels occupied the capital city of Santo Domingo and the following day declared the independence of the Dominican Republic from Haiti. H√©rard responded almost immediately. In March 1844, the Dominican Republic was invaded through its eastern and northern frontiers by two Haitian armies of more than 10,000 men; that of the west commanded by H√©rard arrived at Azua, where was posted the advance guard of the Dominicans under General Pedro Santana, consisting of about 3,000 men with 3 cannons. The fire was opened, and the battle begun, on the 19th of March, when the Dominicans gained the victory, repelling their enemy with the loss of only 2 killed and 3 wounded, while more than 1,000 Haitians remained dead on the field. After this decisive victory, the Dominicans withdrew their headquarters to the River Ocoa, and the valleys of Ban√≠, where their cavalry and lancers could operate; and in this way they restrained the march of the aggressors, who could not advance beyond Azua; and having then attempted to open a way through the passes of the Maniel, they were in every re-encounter driven back with loss. The other Haitian army in the north, commanded by General Pierrot, appeared on the 30th of March near the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, where the Haitians were also repulsed. Musket and cannon fire accounted for 600 Haitian dead; the Dominicans suffered only 1 wounded. This army abandoned the field of battle on the following day, and during its retreat was incessantly harassed and pursued experiencing in this way additional losses. The Haitian army at Azua, having failed in all its attempts to penetrate through the mountain passes, and suffering constant losses, likewise retreated to Port-au-Prince; committing before its departure the infamous and inhuman act of burning the houses at Azua. In retaliation, Dominican gunboats bombarded Haitian coastal cities. Facing increasing opposition in the government and a rapidly deteriorating political situation within the country, on 30 March 1844 H√©rard dissolved the new Constitution and the Parliament. During H√©rard's invasion of the Dominican Republic, an armed revolt began in the Haitian countryside. By the end of March 1844, a rebel army composed of peasants and farmers began to muster near the city of Les Cayes on the southwest peninsula. The rebels, known as piquets, were armed with long pikes (from which they derived their name). Gathering under the command of a General Jean-Jacques Acaau, they formed what became known as \\"L‚ÄôArm√©e Souffrante\\" or the Army of the Sufferers. In April of that year, they met and defeated a government army, although soon after this, their advance on the Haitian capital was checked at the town of Aquin. This however, did not provide a respite for H√©rard. While General Acaau was marching against Port-au-Prince in the south, an armed revolt had begun in the North, fueled by H√©rard's opponents in the government. Faced with this crisis, H√©rard relinquished the Presidency on 3 May 1844. He went into exile on 2 June 1844, resettling in Jamaica, where he died on 31 August 1850.

He founded Mason Machine Works of Taunton, Massachusetts. His company was a significant supplier of locomotives and rifles for the Union Army during the American Civil War. The company also later produced printing presses.  Youth and education  Mason was born in 1808 in Mystic, Connecticut, the son of a blacksmith. As a boy, Mason spent time in his father's shops. He left home at the age of thirteen and worked as an operator in the spinning room of a small cotton factory in Canterbury, Connecticut.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography He was a born mechanical genius and could repair the most complicated machine in the mill. At the age of sixteen he went to East Haddam, where a mill for the manufacture of thread was being established, to start the machines. At seventeen he worked at the machine shop connected with the mill, where he stayed for three years. It was here he set up the first power loom in the country for the manufacture of diaper linen. He also constructed an ingenious loom for the weaving of damask table cloths.  Cotton and weaving machinery  A Mason self-acting mule, ca.1898 In 1833, Mason joined Asell Lamphaer at Killingly, Connecticut, to make the ring-frame for spinning. He remodeled and perfected the \\"ring\\" along with an improved frame.History of Bristol County, Massachusetts, J. W. Lewis & Co., 1883, p 865 In 1835, Mason moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, to join Crocker and Richmond, manufacturers of cotton machinery. He worked almost entirely on ring frames. The firm failed in 1837 during the financial crisis. The business was taken over by Messrs Leach and Keith. Mason was employed as foreman. On October 8, 1840, his greatest invention, a \\"self-acting mule\\" was patented. Competition required improvements and on October 3, 1846, he received a patent for \\"Mason's Self- acting Mule.\\" History of Bristol County, Massachusetts, J. W. Lewis & Co., 1883, p 866 Though the company would also later venture into the production of locomotives, rifles and printing presses, the production of textile machinery would be its most important sector until the later 19th century.  Mason locomotives  Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn #6 (1886) Leach and Keith suffered a failure in the winter of 1842 owing Mason a large amount of money. James K. Mills & Co. of Boston, a leading commission firm, came to his rescue and helped him to buy out the former partners. In 1845, new buildings were erected and the plant became the largest one devoted to the manufacture of machinery in the country. It made cotton machinery, woolen machinery, machinists' tools, blowers, cupola furnaces, gearing, shafting, railroad car wheels made with spokes, and after 1852, locomotives. Mason wanted to improve the symmetry of the American locomotive. A first engine was turned out in 1853. In 1857 his firm failed but he managed to reopen the plant soon afterwards. The textile business recovered rapidly but the locomotive business was less prosperous. By 1860, he had produced a total of only 100 engines. The figure was doubled by 1865 due to the wartime demand and the pace continued for the next several years. Also during the American Civil War, 600 Springfield rifles were turned out weekly. Mason's locomotives were genuinely handsome without ornaments. His influence was exerted over all locomotive builders at the time and later. In 1856 he built two locomotives for the Cairo and Alexandria Railroad of Egypt in which a commentator said that the engines' excellence was due to the accuracy of execution attained by an admirable set of tools and a skillful set of workmen. Opinion by master mechanics was that they were the easiest engines to keep in repair. In 1871, the Mason Bogie was introduced. The business was organized as the Mason Machine Works in 1873 with a capital of $800,000.  Death and legacy  The grave of William Mason, Taunton, Massachusetts Mason died May 21, 1883 of pneumonia. He is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Taunton, Massachusetts. The 700th engine was being completed. Only 54 more engines were completed by 1889 and delivered in 1890. The company continued to build cotton machinery. William Mason was a painter and a good violinist. He established a bank in Taunton for his employees and made gifts to charity. He is remembered as a pioneer in the building of locomotives which ranked foremost in the country.

Slogan reads 'To Nationalize is to De-colonize' The Popular Socialist Party (, PPS) is a communist party in Mexico. It was founded in 1948 as the Popular Party (Partido Popular) by Vicente Lombardo Toledano. Lombardo Toledano, the initial leader of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), decided to launch a new party in response to the increasingly moderate and corrupt policies of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The Popular Party was supported by the mine, oil and rail workers' unions, but its potential strength in elections was reduced by the strength of the PRI. The party adopted Marxism-Leninism as its ideological line in 1960.Rodr√≠guez Araujo, Octavio. La reforma pol√≠tica y los partidos en M√©xico. M√©xico: Siglo Veintiuno Editores, 1989. p. 43 It was renamed the Popular Socialist Party in 1960, and over time its leadership became less critical of the PRI. In subsequent years it was often criticized as being a \\"loyal opposition,\\" or part of the status quo. This led to a split by the PPS's left wing in the 1970s that formed the Party of the Mexican People (PPM), which merged with the Mexican Communist Party to form the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico (PSUM). In 1997, a second party with nearly the same name (Popular Socialist Party of Mexico, or PPSM) split off from the older PPS. This splinter group claims to be the true descendant of Lombardo Toledano's party. The PPS's traditional political space (i.e. to the left of the PRI) has largely been captured by the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) since 1989. The PPS lost its registry as a national political party in 1997, though it is currently registered as a national political association under the name Popular Socialista.

Q. Judge used the similar notion of \\"astral intoxication\\". Aurobindo=Original use The Intermediate Zone is first described in a letter to a disciple in the early 1930s. It was then published in 1933 in The Riddle of this World, a small booklet that includes several essays. The letter later appeared in Letters on Yoga.Sri Aurobindo, Letters on Yoga, Part 3, Section 3 \\"Experiences of the Inner and the Cosmic Consciousness\\", Subsection 5, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram More recently, a number of copies have been posted on the Internet.Grey Lodge Occult Review :: Issue #9 :: The Intermediate Zone :: A shorter but similar reference to a misleading intermediate consciousness, but without the distinguishing qualifier \\"zone\\", is also found in some of the later strata of The Synthesis of Yoga which dates to the early 1940s.Sri Aurobindo, The Synthesis of Yoga, fifth edition, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, p.283 - \\"Another error that has to be guarded against is...to take some higher intermediate consciousness or even any kind of supernormal consciousness for the supermind. To reach supermind it is not enough to go above the ordinary movements of the human mind; it is not enough to receive a greater light, a greater power, a greater joy or to develop capacities of knowledge, sight, effective will that surpass the normal range of the human being. All light is not the light of the spirit, still less is all light the light of the supermind; the mind, the vital, the physical itself have lights of their own, as yet hidden, which can be very inspiring, exalting, informative, powerfully executive...\\" - for the date see \\"note on the text\\", pp.915-6  Characteristics  Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis. William Q. Judge - Astral intoxication In his posthumously published book, Vernal Blooms, Theosophist William Quan Judge (1851-1896) describes the dangers of \\"astral intoxication\\". He asserts that the astral plane, which is the same as that of our psychic senses, has endless powers of delusion. It has to be well understood before the student can stay there long without danger. He states that phenomena, such as astral lights, moments of peace and revelation, do not indicate spiritual advancement. To regard every picture seen in the astral light as a spiritual experience is like becoming drunk. Such indulgence only results in becoming satiated with a store of illusory appearances. True progress is dependent upon purity of motive, and conquest of known or ascertainable defects. The dangers of astral intoxication or delusion are greatest for the person who revolves selfishly around himself. This may happen when one lacks the support and company of other sincere seekers. One Paul Brunton Paul Brunton included Sri Aurobindo's term of the \\"Intermediate Zone\\" as a name for a psychological and immature mystical level of delusion and subtle ego.The Notebooks of Paul Brunton (Published in 1989; 16 volumes) - Volume 11: THE SENSITIVES - ch.12. THE INTERMEDIATE ZONE - online text at Brunton uses several terms, such as astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion. Once there, egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, the emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, the imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. If a person then falls victim to spiritual error regarding this state, the result is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and wild imagination. Brunton considered this a major factor in explaining the human wreckage found on the spiritual path.The Intermediate Zone - Notebooks of Paul Brunton See also * Barzakh, the intermediate zone in Islam. * Spiritual bypass ReferencesSources * Sri Aurobindo The Riddle of This World online * ----- Letters on Yoga, Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, Pondicherry (pp 1039‚Äì1046 of the third edition 1971). * Sri Aurobindo The Synthesis of Yoga, fifth edition, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 1999, (paperback) (hardcover) online * Paul Brunton, Notebooks of Paul Brunton, 1989 online * W.

It closed in 1995. Fitraco, a Belgian company, bought the amusement park at a foreclosure auction in 1995. Ed Hart of Themeparks LLC was approached by Fitraco, and decided to take on the project. The Gauntlet, a suspended looping coaster, opened at the park in 2004 Magic Springs and Crystal Falls reopened on May 27, 2000, after Hot Springs voters approved a bond issue providing financing for the park. Attendance totaled more than 362,500 in 2000 and beat expectations. In 2001, attendance fell about 25 percent to roughly 272,000, and then to about 254,000 in 2002. The park continued to expand its ride offerings instead of hunkering down. Attendance grew again to more than 291,000 in 2003, the year the Timberwood Amphitheater debuted. It topped 400,000 in 2004 when The Gauntlet was added and the concert series was expanded. In March, owners of Magic Springs agreed to sell the attraction to CNL Income Properties. They leased back the park to the former owners, who continued to manage it. On June 10, 2008, it was announced that PARC Management had taken over the park's management. The leasing agreement between owner CNL and PARC Management was terminated in November 2010 and a new operating agreement with Amusement Management Partners, LLC was announced in January 2011. In late 2016, CNL sold a bundle of its theme park properties, including Magic Springs, to EPR Properties, a REIT based in Kansas City. It was announced at that time that management responsibilities for Magic Springs would be assumed by Premier Parks, LLC. At that time the name was changed to Magic Springs Theme and Water Park.

Early life Smart was born in Ridgeland, South Carolina, the son of a railroad conductor, and was educated in the public schools of South Carolina and Georgia, and at Marion Military Institute in Marion, Alabama. Military career Smart graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1931 and entered flight training with the Army Air Corps. He became a flying instructor. When the United States entered World War II, Smart (Colonel at that time) was chief of staff for flight training at Air Force headquarters in Washington, D.C.. World War II Smart joined the Air Corps Advisory Council in July 1942, serving on the staff of General \\"Hap\\" Arnold, Chief of Staff of the Army Air Force. In this position, he was involved with the planning of the invasion of Europe and participated in the meeting between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Casablanca, Morocco in 1943. He received the Legion of Merit for his services. Smart was assigned to 9th Bomber Command in the Middle East in 1943. He was the architect of Operation Tidal Wave, in which 178 B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from five bombardment groups of the 9th Army Air Force flew a 2,400-mile round trip from bases near Benghazi in Libya to perform a low-level bombing raid on the oil refineries at Ploie≈üti, Romania, on 1 August 1943. Nearly 40% of the oil plant was destroyed, but 55 of the American planes were lost and another 50 severely damaged. He received the Distinguished Service Medal; five other airmen received the Medal of Honor, the most for any single military action. Despite its success, the plant was repaired and back to its original operating capacity within a month. Smart attended the Army- Navy Staff College, graduating in February 1944. He then joined the 15th Air Force in the Mediterranean Theater, commanding the 97th Bomb Group in Italy. Despite his knowledge of top secret issues, such as plans for the Normandy invasion, he was allowed to fly missions over enemy territory. On his 29th mission, May 10, 1944, Smart was flying a B-17 Flying Fortress on a mission to bomb aircraft factories near Wiener Neustadt, Austria. The aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and exploded. He was thrown from the wreck in mid-air but managed to open his parachute despite the wounds he had received from the explosion. He landed and was immediately captured by the Germans and held as a prisoner of war until freed by the forces of General George S. Patton's Army in April 1945. His captors knew he was important and did their best to extract secrets from him but Smart was able to evade all their questions. Upon his repatriation to the US, Smart returned to duty as a top aide to General Arnold, continuing as the U.S. Air Force was formed in 1947. He graduated from the National War College in June 1950, and commanded 32nd Air Division at Stewart Air Force Base in New York, and was later vice commander of Eastern Air Defense Force. Postwar career During the Korean War, Smart served as deputy for operations in the Far East Air Force where he showed his skill as a strategist. He also flew several sorties, and was injured. He returned to Washington, D.C., in June 1955, as assistant vice chief of staff at U.S. Air Force Headquarters, and became commander of the Twelfth Air Force, Tactical Air Command, in September 1959. He became vice commander of Tactical Air Command in January 1960, based at Langley Air Force Base. He served as Commander U.S. Forces in Japan from August 1961; and then as Commander of the Pacific Air Forces in Honolulu from August 1963. He became Deputy Commander of the U.S. European Command in July 1964, and retired in July 1966. Later life Following his retirement, Smart served as an administrator with NASA for several years. He eventually returned to live in Ridgeland. Smart died in his sleep from congestive heart failure at the age of 97 on Sunday, November 12, 2006 and was buried the following week on Thursday November 16, 2006. He was divorced in 1946. He had four children; three daughters and a son. He was predeceased by two daughters. Awards and decorations Smart received numerous decorations including: Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross, Legion of Merit and four awards of the Air Medal. He was also awarded the decoration of Ulchi by the Republic of Korea, and was an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. *60px Distinguished Service Cross *60px Air Force Distinguished Service Medal *60px Legion of Merit *60px Distinguished Flying Cross *60px Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters References *Forged In Fire, DeWitt Copp, Doubleday, 1982 (episodes in the book trace Gen.

In 1949 occupied Germany's railways were returned to German control after four years of Allied control following World War II. Those in the Soviet occupation zone (which became the German Democratic Republic or GDR on 7 October 1949) continued to run as the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the name given to the German national railways in 1937. In West Germany, the Reichsbahn was succeeded by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB). Both the Reichsbahn and the Bundesbahn continued as separate entities until 1994, when they merged to form the Deutsche Bahn. Organisation The DR was the largest employer in the GDR and as a state-owned firm was directly subordinated to the GDR Ministry of Transport (Ministerium f√ºr Verkehr der DDR). From November 1954 - November 1989, the GDR Minister of Transport also occupied the position of the Director General of the DR (Generaldirektor der Deutschen Reichsbahn). The headquarters of the DR were located in East Berlin at No. 33 Vo√üstra√üe, close to the Berlin Wall and across from the site of the former Reich Chancellery. The company was administratively subdivided into eight regional directorates (Reichsbahndirektionen) with headquarters in Berlin, Cottbus, Dresden, Erfurt, Greifswald, Halle, Magdeburg, and Schwerin. Mitropa furnished catering services to the DR, both on board trains and in stations. Passenger service The DR was centrally directed according to socialist principles within the context of a centrally-planned command economy. By 1989, 17.2% of the passenger transport volume in the GDR was handled by the DR ‚Äì three times the market share of the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) in West Germany. Fares were fairly cheap, but trains tended to be overcrowded and slow, owing in part to the poor condition of most railway lines in the GDR. The DR did offer a limited number of express trains such as the \\"Neptun\\" (Berlin ‚Äì Copenhagen), \\"Vindobona\\" (Berlin ‚Äì Vienna), \\"Karlex\\" (Berlin ‚Äì Carlsbad), and \\"Balt-Orient-Express\\" (Berlin ‚Äì Bucharest). Electrification In March 1971 the DR's Interzone express departs Hamburg for Berlin with class 01.5 steam power, a 4-6-2 \\"Pacific\\". Steam engines were the workhorses after the war and remained important for a long time into the period of German partition. The DR's last steam engine (on normal-gauge tracks) was taken out of service on 28 May 1988. Much of the electrified rail network that existed in (present-day) eastern Germany in 1945 had been removed and sent to the Soviet Union as war reparations in the early years of Soviet occupation. By the early 1970s, only a small portion of the tracks in the GDR had been electrified in comparison with those in Western Europe; the GDR leadership chose to reduce the pace of electrification and instead relied on mostly Russian-made diesel locomotives due to the easy availability of fuel from the Soviet Union at subsidised prices. When the GDR's energy costs began to rise dramatically in the early 1980s (in part because the Soviet Union ceased to subsidize the price of fuel sold to the GDR), the DR embarked on a large rail electrification campaign as the GDR's electrical power grid could be supplied with electricity generated from the burning of domestically- produced lignite. The electrified rail network grew from 11.5% in 1979 to 27.3% by 1990. The DR in Berlin during the Cold War Due to the Four-Power Occupation Agreements for Berlin, in which the long-term division of Germany and Berlin (the partition of Germany into two German states; and Berlin partitioned into two principal zones of occupation, West Berlin and East Berlin) was not foreseen, the DR operated the long-haul railway service (Fernverkehr) and barge canals in both East and West Berlin throughout the years of the Cold War (and also after the reunification of Germany) until the merger of the DR and DB in January 1994. This led to unique situations due to the occupied status of West Berlin and the presence of the DR there. For example, there were Bahnpolizei (railway police) employed by the DR in their West Berlin railway stations who were controlled by the GDR Interior Ministry, although the three Western Allies (the United States, Great Britain, and France) never officially recognized the authority of the GDR government in the Soviet (Eastern) sector of Berlin, let alone in West Berlin. For this reason, the West Berlin Polizei had separate patrols who were empowered to maintain law and order in the West Berlin railway stations. The West German Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) maintained a ticket office in West Berlin for many years on Hardenbergstra√üe near the main Zoological Garden railway station that was run by the Eastern Reichsbahn. One reason for this was due to the generally poor customer service offered at the DR's ticket counters . Another reason may have been psychological ‚Äì to promote a visible West German government presence in West Berlin. Another oddity was the presence of a ticket counter at the East Berlin station Berlin Ostbahnhof (known as Berlin Hauptbahnhof from 1987 to 1998) operated by the Soviet (later Russian) military to facilitate transport of their personnel to and from Russia. A special military train regularly operated between Berlin and Moscow until 1994 when the Russian military finally withdrew from Germany. Each of the Western Allies also maintained their stations and ticket offices in their respective zones: *United States: Lichterfelde West; *United Kingdom: Charlottenburg; and *France: Tegel. The Western Allies operated military trains over DR lines converging on the route between Berlin-Wannsee and Marienborn. DR conductors and engine crews managed these trains while military transport officers and soldiers dealt with their passengers and the Soviet military checkpoint officials at Marienborn. The presence of the DR in West Berlin was costly to the GDR ‚Äì the annual operating deficit for the DR in West Berlin in the early 1980s was estimated to be around 120-140 million Deutsche Marks. The status of Berlin is also believed to be the reason the East Germans retained the name Deutsche Reichsbahn as it was mentioned as such in transit treaties. After the foundation of East Germany on 7 October 1949 the East German government continued to run all the railways in its territory under the official name Deutsche Reichsbahn, by so doing it maintained responsibility for almost all railway transport in all four sectors of Berlin. Had the DR been renamed, for example, Staatseisenbahn der DDR (State Railways of the GDR) along the lines of other East German institutions, the Western Allies would probably have refused to recognise it as the same or a successor organization and removed its right to operate in West Berlin. The legal necessity of keeping the term 'Deutsche Reichsbahn' explains the unique use of the word 'Reich' (with its Imperial and Nazi connotations) in the name of an official organisation of the communist GDR. This quasi-official presence in West Berlin was apparently of an utmost importance to the GDR regime, otherwise it is hard to explain why the anti- imperialist and cash-strapped GDR government was willing to both continue using the word 'Reich' and incur large hard currency deficits to operate and maintain the West Berlin railway system. The S-Bahn in West Berlin during the Cold War In 1969 a third-rail S-Bahn train eases past West Berlin firemen fighting a trackside fire in untrimmed brush. The DR also operated the S-Bahn local train service in West Berlin during much of the Cold War period. Following the erection of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, many West Berliners boycotted the S-Bahn in West Berlin. After a strike by West Berlin- based DR employees in September 1980, the S-Bahn service in West Berlin was greatly reduced. Almost half of the West Berlin S-Bahn railway network was closed following this action, including the closure of the western portion of the Berlin circular ring railway (Ringbahn). Patchwork conditions on the West Berlin S-Bahn were illustrated in 1969 by this station on the Lichterfelde-S√ºd Line. On 9 January 1984, a treaty between the GDR and the West Berlin Senate entered into force and turned over the responsibility for the operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin to the West Berlin transport authority BVG. The BVG gradually restored much of the S-Bahn service that had been previously reduced. Following the reunification in October 1990, the arrangements were kept until the creation of Deutsche Bahn AG on 1 January 1994 when the new company took over all S-Bahn operations in the Greater Berlin region. It took several years to fully restore all of S-Bahn services throughout the Greater Berlin region. Service on the West Berlin portion of the Ringbahn was not restored until after reunification (in phases, from 1993 to 2002). Capital projects continue to address the backlog of construction needs that developed during the DR-GDR era. The DR after the reunification of Germany Article 26 of the Unification Treaty (Einigungsvertrag) between the two German states signed on 31 August 1990 established the DR as special property (Sonderverm√∂gen) of the Federal Republic of Germany, and stipulated the DR to be merged with DB at the earliest opportunity. Upon reunification, the DR and DB continued to operate as separate entities in their respective service areas, albeit under a coordination agreement concerning operations. On 1 June 1992, the DB and DR formed a joint board of directors which governed both entities. The merger between the DR and DB was delayed by several years over the structure of the merged railway due to concerns by German politicians on the ever-increasing annual operating deficits incurred by the DB and DR. The Federal Ministry of Transport (Bundesverkehrsministerium) proposed a comprehensive reform of the German railway system (Bahnreform) which was approved by the Bundestag in 1993 and went into effect on 1 January 1994, that included the planned merger between the DR and DB on 1 January 1994 to form the Deutsche Bahn Aktiengesellschaft or AG (Corporation), which is a state- owned limited stock company.

Annaud auditioned 50 bear actors from all over the world before selecting Bart for the role. In order to perform the role, Bart, trained by Seus, successfully learned several new routines and behaviors, including going against his natural abhorrence of a strange bear to accept the unrelated cub co-starring with him.

His zoological explorations in Tibet served as a cover for his role in the German secret service. He was also a scientific member in the Ahnenerbe and held the rank of an SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer. Early life Sch√§fer was born in Cologne, and even as a young boy, he spent time in the outdoors shooting with an air gun and rearing birds, insects and reptiles. After high school (Abitur 1928 from Mannheim), he worked at Vogelwarten in Denmark and Heligoland. He then joined the University of G√∂ttingen and studied zoology, botany and geology. He was a fan of the Swedish geographer Sven Hedin. He met Hugo Weigold on a study trip to Helgoland, which led him to join Weigold and American Brooke Dolan II from the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences to China in 1930‚Äì31. He published Berge, Buddhas und B√§ren (Mountains, Buddhas and Bears) in 1933, based on the trip and gained wide recognition. In 1934, Dolan invited Sch√§fer for a second trip into Tibet in 1934, which affected his studies in the University of G√∂ttingen under Professor Alfred K√ºhn. He then transferred to the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. He determined the yeti to be a Tibetan bear (Ursus arctos pruinosus). Sch√§fer married in 1937, but his wife died in a hunting accident in November, which affected him for months. He completed his Ph.D. in 1938, based on his studies of the birds of Tibet. Sch√§fer joined the Schutzstaffel in 1933 but, after World War II, he claimed to have been an unwilling recruit who joined only to advance his career. Expedition Ernst Sch√§fer in Allied internment In 1936, he was appointed Untersturmf√ºhrer in the personal staff, and in 1942 he was promoted to SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer. He led the third expedition to Tibet in 1938-39 under the patronage of Heinrich Himmler, the SS, and various sponsors. As many as 3,300 bird specimens were collected in these expeditions. A film was produced on the expedition titled Geheimnis Tibet (Secret Tibet). Himmler was personally interested in the project due to various pet pseudo-scientific theories that he subscribed to including ideas such as human origins, and Hanns H√∂rbiger's Welteislehre (\\"World Ice Theory\\"). In July 1934, during his second expedition in Asia, he met the then exiled Panchen Lama, Thubten Ch√∂kyi Nyima, at a mountain temple near Hangzhou, China. He describes the Lama as a kindly, sympathetic man who enquired about how far Germany was and whether he had been waylaid by any robbers on the way. The SS Ahnenerbe Expedition to Tibet during the 1930s was also successful for the German naturalists \\"Meanwhile, Ernst Sch√§fer and Bruno Beger, Edmund Geer and Krause carefully packed up the voluminous natural history collection- animal and bird skins; butterflies, bees, ants, wasps and other insect specimens; fragile dried plants for the herbarium; packets of seeds containing one thousand, six hundred varieties of barley, seven hundred varieties of wheat, and seven hundred varieties of oats; not to mention hundreds of seeds from other potentially useful plants.\\" These seeds collected during the Tibetan expeditions were important, as Heinrich Himmler planned to develop hardy new varieties of crops in order to boost the agricultural yields of colonies across the Eastern territories of the Ukraine and Crimea. Himmler ordered the Ahnenerbe to found a teaching and research institute in plant genetics, assigning the task to Dr. Ernst Sch√§fer, who he found to be an ideal young German zoologist who could also lead the Tibet Expedition. Sch√§fer set to work with characteristic vigor. He obtained a staff of seven research scientists, including a British prisoner of war, and set up an experimental research station in Lannach, near the city of Graz in Austria. There the new institute went to work, experimenting with samples of grains that Sch√§fer had acquired from the granaries of the Tibetan nobility. A statue in a German private collection which has come to be called the \\"Iron Man\\" is speculated to have been obtained by Ernst Schafer during the Tibet expedition in 1938McGrath, Matt. 2012. \\"Ancient statue discovered by Nazis is made from meteorite.\\" BBC News (27 September). as part of the Tibet mission that was supported by Himmler. There is no proof that this was indeed obtained during the expedition but it has been a subject of considerable speculation. Analysis showed that it was made from iron of meteoric origin, specifically of an ataxite class, an extremely rare type, of meteorite and possibly carved from a piece of the Chinga meteorite. The statue is believed to portray the god Vaisravana. Speculation that it belongs to the pre-Buddhist Bon culture that existed in Asia about 1,000 years ago has been brought into question due to certain incoherent features of clothing and style.http://info- buddhism.com/Bayer_2012-Trousers.pdf In 1945, Sch√§fer was awarded the War Merit Cross, 2nd class with Swords. He was made an honorary member of the German ornithologists federation (DO-G) on 7 December 1939, his wedding day, a gift from Erwin Stresemann. Postwar career After the 1939 expedition he returned to Germany and he married Ursula in December. In 1945 Sch√§fer was interned by Allied Military Government but was exonerated for war crimes in June 1949 and released. In 1950 he moved with his wife and daughter to Venezuela and conducted studies there while also teaching in Maracay and Caracas. From 1949 to 1954 he was a professor in Venezuela, when he returned to Europe to become an adviser to the Belgian King Leopold III. With film- maker Heinz Sielmann, he produced Herrscher des Urwalds (Rulers of the Wild) (1958) in the Congo forests. Sch√§fer served as the curator of the Department of Natural History at the Lower Saxony State Museum from 1960 until 1970.

Cryonics is the preservation through cold storage, usually with liquid nitrogen, of humans (and sometimes non-human animals) after legal death. This procedure is done in the hopes of eventual \\"reanimation.\\" Any such reanimation depends upon future technological advances that are hoped for, but by no means assured or promised. The American Cryonics Society is the oldest cryonics organization still in existence. Since 1972 ACS has offered a program where members who enroll, are placed into cryonic suspension upon their deaths and then maintained in liquid nitrogen. This program provides for continuous funding so that the relatives of the subject are not required to pay for the initial freezing, yearly maintenance in liquid nitrogen, or eventual reanimation (should the latter prove possible). Members often provide such funding through the purchase of a life insurance policy. History The American Cryonics Society was first incorporated in 1969 in San Francisco as the Bay Area Cryonics Society (BACS); its name was changed to the American Cryonics Society in 1985. The founding of the company followed over two years of organizational meetings by cryonics activists. Signers of the founding charter included two well-known Bay Area physicians, Dr. M. Coleman Harris, and Dr. Grace Talbot. The 1969 incorporation date makes it the oldest cryonics society still in existence. The Immortalist Society (IS), with which the American Cryonics Society works closely, is a successor to the Cryonics Society of Michigan whose founding predates that of the American Cryonics Society. Since its beginning, the American Cryonics Society has made valuable contributions to research and methodology of freezing and cold storage of organs and organism. The first suspensions of humans under the ACS program were in 1974 through Trans Time, a company founded in 1972 by activist members of the American Cryonics Society (then BACS). This was followed by a succession of additional suspensions and ongoing research into methods of preservation and procedures for maintaining tissue, organs, and organisms at liquid nitrogen temperature. Starting in 1974 ACS-sponsored research into establishing suspension procedures included development of \\"blood substitutes\\" and flushes to replace the blood in cryonic patients with a solution which had cryoprotective properties. Dr. Paul Segall was the chief researcher, and following a technological report that the international press viewed as significant, Dr. Segall, Dr. Richard Marsh, and Avi Ben-Abraham, MD, appeared on Good Morning America, The Phil Donahue Show, The Sally Jessy Raphael Show, and made many other popular media appearances. In 1987 Dr. Avi Ben-Abraham was elected as Chairman, President and Governor of the American Cryonics Society and led the society for over a decade. A prominent physician and scientist, Dr. Ben-Abraham brought a high degree of respectability and public attention to ACS. During Dr. Ben-Abraham's tenure, cryonics research received a major boost, and the scientific progress made by ACS's scientists, was featured in the New York Times, The Saturday Evening Post and on the cover of Leaders magazine among others. Dr. Ben-Abraham was featured on several prestigious television programs in the US and overseas, including CBS's 48 Hours and 60 Minutes, The Joan Rivers Show, CNBC Live and on a special BBC television documentary. American Cryonics Society researchers would later develop commercial organ preservation solutions, based in part on ACS-sponsored research. In May 1988, ACS researchers , Paul Segal, Hal Sternberg, Harry Weitz and Avi Ben-Abraham, authored a scientific paper, \\"Interventive Gerentology, Cloning, and Cryonics: Relevance to Life Extension,\\" that was published in Biomedical Advances in Aging and edited by Allan L. Goldstein. The team presented this paper at a symposium held at George Washington University. The inclusion of this paper in a publication of serious academic inquiry properly identifies cryonics as scientific discipline. Concurrent with biological research, the American Cryonics Society established financial and managerial policy to better safeguard the funds of members in suspension. This included funding through life insurance and conservative estimates of suspension and maintenance costs to ensure adequate funding. In 1981, the American Cryonics Society employed attorney Jim Bianchi to develop model trust and model will documents for people who wished suspension. Mr. Bianchi also researched the legal basis for cryonics, and developed a set of related documents. In 1978, the Cryonics Society of America researchers collaborated with Jerry Leaf of Cryovita Laboratories in experiments that would apply the methodology to cryonic suspensions that were then in use as surgical procedures to treat patients with heart disease. Thus a team led by a thoracic surgeon and a perfusionist would use cardio-pulmonary resuscitation equipment and blood-pumps to quickly cool a patient, and replace his blood with a blood substitute containing cryoprotectants. For several years thereafter, Cryovita Laboratories led by Jerry Leaf and Mike Darwin, were responsible for the initial cryonic suspension of patients of the American Cryonics Society, which were then perfused, transported, and kept in cryogenic storage by Trans Time. This method of making use of contract companies as a means of risk management was unique to the American Cryonics Society and has been followed to the present day. In 1992, the American Cryonics Society signed contracts with the newly formed CryoSpan Corporation and transferred a number of patients to that Southern California facility, as well as making use of CryoSpan services for a number of new patients. At about this same time it contracted with BioPreservation Inc., operated by Mike Darwin, to perform the standby and initial suspension of the Cryonics Society of America members. The American Cryonics Society also purchased suspension and ‚Äúfirst response‚Äù equipment from Darwin and other suppliers to enable the American Cryonics Society to freeze its own members, to supplement its employment of contract companies. In 2002 when CryoSpan opted to close down its long-term cryogenic storage operations, 10 ACS patients and a number of pets were transferred to the Cryonics Institute (CI) facility in Michigan. The American Cryonics Society had contracted with CI for the long-term cryogenic storage of a number of other members prior to the 2002 patient transfer. The ACS inspects CI yearly to ensure ACS quality standards are met. The extra funds charged to ACS members beyond CI minimums could be used for moving the patients in the future if necessary, or other uses. In 2004, the American Cryonics Society signed a contract with Suspended Animation, a Florida based company, and in the same year Suspended Animation performed a stand-by and suspension on an ACS member living in Florida at the time of his death. The patient was then transported to the CI Facility in Michigan for long-term cryogenic storage. When circumstances warrant, neural vitrification technology may also be applied to ACS subjects by CI personnel prior to long-term cryogenic storage. Policies The American Cryonics Society is managed by a seven-person Board of Governors. Governors must themselves be full members, and are expected to have made suspension arrangements. Funds are managed by professional funds managers. As a further safeguard, a sponsor is designated for each person in suspension, to review financial records and cold-storage procedures. The Cryonics Society of America works cooperatively with the Cryonics Institute and supports the research program of that organization. Most ACS (frozen) members are in suspension at the CI facility. The agreement with CI calls for the American Cryonics Society to have inspection authority, and to have the right to remove ACS subjects from that facility should the American Cryonics Society warrant that such removal is warranted and beneficial. Such subject would then be transferred to another facility. All ACS subjects are fully funded to CI‚Äôs specification, and in addition, funds to benefit the subjects are maintained by the American Cryonics Society. This funding plan provides a double safety net against the possible financial insolvency of either CI or ACS. The American Cryonics Society encourages members and the public in general to subscribe to the Immortalist Magazine. This bi-monthly magazine is devoted to discussion of cryonics activities, especially those of the Cryonics Institute where most patients of the American Cryonics Society are in long term cryogenic storage. Scope The American Cryonics Society welcomes members from any country, however the level of service that a member can expect in most countries outside the US and Canada is limited, and in many cases the member himself, sometimes working with other cryonics advocates, must work to make local arrangements. Even then, given so much uncertainty, the American Cryonics Society can make no guarantees. Perspective The cryonics movement, which started with the publication of Robert Ettinger‚Äôs book The Prospect of Immortality in 1964, is still treated as a curiosity by most people, though cryonics continues to gain in acceptance by both the general public, and the scientific community. Given the small number of people in suspension, and the incidents of patients lost to carelessness or accident in the past, the risk management approach to cryonics followed by the American Cryonics Society is warranted. That said, the extant cryonics organizations appear to have stability not always present in the past, and there have been no recent incidents of lost patients. There are (perhaps) 1,800 people with pre-need cryonics arrangements in place; however many of these people are young and not apt to need services for many years. As of the end of 2010, there are about 220 bodies now frozen. These numbers include members and frozen bodies from all organizations, in all countries. Almost half of them are at the Alcor facility, and half at the CI facility (which includes the patients of the American Cryonics Society). A couple of subjects are at Trans Time and KrioRus, and we will include in our count the dry ice storage of Mr. Bredo Morstoel, in Nederland, Colorado, though many cryonicists argue that because of the warmer storage temperature of Mr. Morstoel, he should not be counted as a \\"patient.\\" Since the patients at the CI facility are almost all whole body patients (as opposed to head only), the volume of biological material at the CI facility is far greater than at the other facilities. From 1974 to present, only one American Cryonics Society body has had to be transferred out of long-term cold storage. In that case the transfer was following a request made by the patient‚Äôs family, apparently for financial reasons. The patient was then preserved by chemical means. However, there have been several patients \\"converted\\" from whole-body to \\"neuro\\" because of funding concerns. The American Cryonics Society members either pre-approve or opt out of such arrangements as part of their contract. There have been no incidents in ACS history of embezzlement or loss of any patient funds.

Henri-Gustave Casadesus (30 September 1879, Paris ‚Äì 31 May 1947, Paris) was a violist, viola d'amore player, composer, and music publisher. Early life Casadesus received his early musical instruction with Albert Lavignac and studied viola with Th√©ophile Laforge at the Conservatoire de Paris, taking first prize in 1899. From 1910 to 1917, he was the violist of the Capet Quartet.Henri Casadesus Career Along with Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Casadesus founded the \\"Soci√©t√© des instruments anciens\\" in 1901. The society, which operated between 1901 and 1939, was a quintet of performers who used obsolete instruments such as the viola da gamba, or Casadesus's own instrument, the viola d'amore. The quintet was also notable in its day for premiering rediscovered works by long- dead composers. It was later discovered that Casadesus and his brothers, notably Marius Casadesus, wrote these works. The Ad√©la√Øde Concerto, allegedly by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, is sometimes mistakenly attributed to Henri but is actually by Marius. However, Henri is believed to have been the author of a \\"Concerto in D Major for viola\\" ascribed to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, described by Rachel W. Wade in her survey The Keyboard Concertos of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. This concerto appeared in 1911 in a Russian edition, allegedly \\"transcribed...for small orchestra by Maximilian Steinberg,\\" and was subsequently performed by conductors such as Darius Milhaud and Serge Koussevitsky, then recorded by both Felix Prohaska and Eugene Ormandy, all under the false attribution. \\"Thus,\\" Wade wrote in 1981, \\"at the present time, the most frequently recorded concerto of C.P.E.

These are often referred to as \\"The Handel/Casadesus Concerto\\" and \\"The J.C. Bach/Casadesus Concerto\\". Scholarly criticism has confirmed that both these concerti were written by Henri Casadesus in the style of their purported composers.

Its first discovery was at Lenart, Slovenia, which led to its alias of Lenart. It was isolated in Hong Kong several times at the beginning of 1994, but did not become common until it spread to North America in the Spring of 1995. AntiCMOS is a fairly standard boot virus, and is primarily notable for being one of the few DOS viruses to remain in the wild as of 2020. AntiCMOS is so named because it has the intended effect of erasing all CMOS information. This does not occur because of a bug in the virus code. This is true of all AntiCMOS variants that have appeared in the wild. The payload date of December 1993 and the obsolete nature of these variants makes it very unlikely that AntiCMOS's payload will ever be a threat. AntiCMOS.B AntiCMOS.B is a boot virus. It was isolated in mid-1995. Like AntiCMOS.A, AntiCMOS.B became common worldwide. However, this variant never reached the success level of the original, and is now considered obsolete. Infected floppy disks contain the following text: : I am Li Xibin Additionally, AntiCMOS.B attempts to play a tune, but this fails due to coding errors . AntiCMOS.B is otherwise a typical boot virus, much like its predecessor. AntiCMOS.C AntiCMOS.C is a boot virus and very minor variant of the AntiCMOS family.

The cerebellopontine angle is also the site of a set of neurological disorders known as the cerebellopontine angle syndrome. Structure The cerebellopontine angle is formed by the cerebellopontine fissure. This fissure is made when the cerebellum folds over to the pons, creating a sharply defined angle between them. The angle formed in turn creates a subarachnoid cistern, the cerebellopontine angle cistern. The pia mater follows the outline of the fissure and the arachnoid mater continues across the divide so that the subarachnoid space is dilated at this area, forming the cerebellopontine angle cistern. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) is the principal vessel of the cerebellopontine angle. It also contains two cranial nerves ‚Äì the vestibulocochlear nerve and the facial nerve; the cerebellar flocculus and the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle.

The trees of the cemetery might originally have been a woodland or a tighter forest where a portion of the trees have been removed, and some of the trees might be planted as well. Among famous woodland cemeteries that became models for other cemeteries of similar design are the Munich Waldfriedhof of 1907 in Germany, often mentioned as the first woodland cemetery, and Skogskyrkog√•rden outside of Stockholm in Sweden which is declared a world heritage site.

It is a historic cemetery of both the Colonial period (18th-century) and the Victorian period (19th-century). Although located in Middlesex County, the majority of the burials are from Somerset County, which directly borders the cemetery. History Prior to 1868, the cemetery was an informal burial ground on the farm of John Van Cleef. It was near where Six Mile Run, a small stream, crossed historic King's Highway (now Route 27) in the historic community of Six Mile Run. The cemetery was associated with the Church at Six Mile Run, which was located there from 1710 to 1766 when it moved to its present location approximately one mile south. The Elm Ridge Cemetery Company was formed in 1868 by an act of the State of New Jersey authorizing the company to purchase an adjoining tract, to improve and operate the cemetery, sell burial plots, and be exempt from taxation as long as the land was used as a cemetery. The act named the initial seven members of corporation that would manage the cemetery, specified that all future members must be owners of burial plots within the cemetery, and that a new board would be elected annually by vote proportional to the number of plots owned. The act also specified that family gravesites in the old cemetery could continue to be used for burial by the respective families. A conservation assessment was performed in 2005. A conservation project was completed in 2006 to address deterioration of the grave markers. Markers were reset, repaired, and cleaned by Cultural Heritage Research Services, a historic preservation services company. Frelinghuysen Monument Monument of Frelinghuysen Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen ( ‚Äì ) was Dutch-Reformed minister and theologian who immigrated in 1720 to the Raritan River valley of New Jersey to lead the congregations at Raritan, New Brunswick, Six-Mile Run, Three-Mile Run, North Branch and Harlingen. Upon his death, he was buried at the Six Mile Run cemetery without a tombstone. When in 1884 his descendants decided to place a stone on his grave, they could not determine where his body was interred. They erected a cenotaph with the following inscription: > Rev. Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen. Born at Lingen, East Freesland in > 1691. In 1719, he was sent to take charge of the Reformed Churches here by > the Classis of Amsterdam. He was a learned man and a successful preacher. > The field of his labor still bears fruit. In contending for a Spiritual > Religion his motto was, \\"Laudem non quaero, culpam non timeo.\\" He died in > 1747, and his descendants, humbly sharing in his faith, have erected to his > memory this monument.

The organization advocated immediate withdrawal of all Coalition forces in Iraq, and reparations paid to the Iraqi people. It also provides support services for returning veterans to include health care and mental health.War is not a Game: The New Antiwar Soldiers and the Movement They Built; Nan Levinson; Rutgers University Press; 2014 Membership The membership is composed of American military veterans, active-duty service personnel from all branches of the military, and U.S. National Guard members and reservists who have served since September 11, 2001. Prospective members are required to provide proof of military service.Verification of Service  Iraq Veterans Against the War The group was founded in July 2004, with much controversy due to its exclusion of Desert Storm veterans, who most obviously had served in Iraq and were opposed to war. Desert storm Veteran Dennis Kyne spoke at the opening session during the VFP convention against this separation. To date, veterans who served in Iraq before the re-invasion in 2003 have still not been invited to membership. The group formed at the annual Veterans for Peace convention in Boston with guidance from VVAW Vietnam Veterans Against the War seven veterans: former Executive Director Kelly Dougherty (U.S. Army), Tim Goodrich (U.S. Air Force), Mike Hoffman (U.S. Marine Corps), Alex Ryabov (U.S. Marine Corps), Jimmy Massey (U.S. Marine Corps), Isaiah Pallos (U.S. Marine Corps), and Diana Morrison (U.S. Army). By 2008 the majority of the founding members had separated from the organization. By 2010 IVAW had 61 chapters around the United States; one in Toronto, Canada, made up of war resisters; and a chapter in Germany, five of which are on active duty military bases. The six active duty chapters are on Fort Drum, New York; Fort Meade, Maryland; Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Hood, Texas; Lawton-Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and Camp Lejeune and MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina.Chapters and Regions  Iraq Veterans Against the War Members of the organization reside in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., Canada, Europe, and on numerous bases overseas, including bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Truth in Recruiting IVAW has actively participated in a nationwide Truth in Recruiting campaign aimed at countering alleged misconceptions of military service propagated by recruiters. Currently many IVAW members are involved in \\"equal access\\" policies at high schools across the country. Stop-loss policy IVAW has protested the military's stop-loss policy, which is an extension of soldiers' Active Duty service period by the Department of Defense. All service members sign up for a minimum of eight years of total service, a portion of which (generally around four years) is served in the Inactive Ready Reserve. The Defense Department may recall members from inactive service as noted in their enlistment contracts.

Henry Slade (1835-1905) was a famous fraudulent medium who lived and practiced in both Europe and North America. Biography One of Slade's fraudulent slate writing methods. Slade was most well known as a slate-writing medium. During his s√©ances he would place a small slate with a piece of chalk under a table and would claim spirits would use it to write messages. According to Joe Nickell, Slade was repeatedly caught faking the spirit messages in his s√©ances and he produced his phenomena by a variety of magic tricks.Joe Nickell. (2007). Adventures in Paranormal Investigation. The University Press of Kentucky. p. 40. Science writer Karen Stollznow has noted that: In 1872, Slade was caught in fraud in New York by John W. Truesdell, who had two sittings with him. During the s√©ance Truesdell observed Slade using his foot to move objects under the table, and writing on a slate.Carl Murchison. (1927). The Case For And Against Psychical Belief. Clark University. p. 242 In a s√©ance Stanley LeFevre Krebs employed a secret mirror and caught Slade swapping slates and hiding them in the back of his chair.Gordon Stein. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 705. In a s√©ance in 1876 in London Ray Lankester and Bryan Donkin caught Slade in fraud. Lankester snatched the slate before the \\"spirit\\" message was supposed to be written, and found the writing already there. He was prosecuted for fraud on October 1, 1876 in London and was sentenced to three months in prison.Joseph McCabe. (1920). Spiritualism: A Popular History from 1847. Dodd, Mead and Company. pp. 160-161 However, Slade made an appeal, which was sustained, on the ground that the words \\"by palmistry or otherwise\\" had been omitted in the indictment. Before he could be arrested on the new summons, he fled to America.Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. p. 254. Slade also performed a trick where he would play an accordion with one hand under the table. The magician Chung Ling Soo exposed how Slade had performed the trick.Chung Ling Soo. (1898). Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena. Munn & Company. pp. 105-106. \\"Dr. Henry Slade was, of course, identified and recognized as the principal slate- writing medium, but at various times he presented other phenomena, one of which was the playing of an accordion while held in one hand under the table. The accordion was taken by him from the table with his right hand, at the end containing the strap, the keys or notes at the other end being away from him. He thus held the accordion beneath the table, and his left hand was laid on top of the table, where it was always in plain view. Nevertheless, the accordion was heard to give forth melodious tunes, and at the conclusion was brought up on top of the table as held originally; the whole dodge consisting in turning the accordion end for end as it went under the table. The strap end being now downward, and held between the legs, the medium's hand grasped the keyboard end, and worked the bellows and keys, holding the accordion firmly with the legs and working the hand, not with an arm movement, but mostly by a simple wrist movement. Of course, at the conclusion, the hand grasped the accordion at the strap end, and brought it up in this condition. Sometimes an accordion is tied with strings and sealed so the bellows cannot be worked. This is for the dark s√©ance. Even in this condition the accordion is played by inserting a tube in the air-hole or valve and by the medium's using his lungs as bellows.\\" Johann Karl Friedrich Z√∂llner, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leipzig conducted several controlled experiments, using Slade, to evaluate his claims of paranormal ability in 1877. Slade failed some of the tests carried out under controlled conditions but still succeeded in fooling Z√∂llner in several other attempts. Hereward Carrington in his book The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism (1907) revealed the fraudulent methods (with diagrams of the rope tricks) that Slade used in the Z√∂llner experiments.Hereward Carrington. (1907). The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism. Herbert B. Turner & Co. pp. 19-47 In 1882 in Belleville s√©ance sitters caught Slade making \\"spirit\\" raps against the rung of his chair, using his foot to move a slate, writing \\"spirit\\" messages and substituting slates. He was also exposed as a fraud in 1885 by the Seybert Commission as it was discovered that the slates had prepared messages on them.Carl Murchison. (1927). The Case For And Against Psychical Belief. Clark University. pp. 242-243 The magician David Abbott in his book Behind the Scenes with the Mediums (1908) revealed that Slade would also use his toes for writing messages on slates.David Abbot. (1908). Behind the Scenes with the Mediums. The Open Court Publishing Company. p. 191 Confession The magician Harry Houdini met the ex-medium Remigius Weiss in Philadelphia who had testified to the Seybert Commission that Slade's methods were fraudulent. According to Houdini he had given him the \\"best expose ever written of Slade's slate writings.\\" Weiss also obtained a signed confession from Slade that all his spiritualist manifestations were deceptions performed through tricks and this confession was reproduced by Houdini in his book A Magician Among the Spirits (first published, 1924).Harry Houdini.

Ruth Galanter inherited a neighborhood sponsored assessment for improving the Venice Canals, but the final design selection and ultimate canal improvements in 1991 can be credited to Galanter's leadership as a Los Angeles City Councilwoman. The original assessment project was sponsored by the Venice Canals Association (VCA) in 1976 during Pat Russell's term as council member. Venice Canals Association board members Barbara Michalak, Les Otterstrom, Paula Tate, Marla Engel, Ruth Ann Steffens, Fred Hoffman, Anita Henkins, Joseph Smith, W. Reid Monroe, Bonnie Felix, and Murray Leral worked to establish the assessment district for the Venice Canal Improvement Project. The first attempted design for the 1977 Venice Canals Assessment district was prepared by City of Los Angeles public works under the direction of City Engineer Luis Ganajas. The design was known as the vertical wall plan, similar to the existing Marina Del Rey walls, and were vertical solid cement with a decorative end cap. At the time there were at least three historic attempts to restore or rehabilitate the Venice Canals, all eventually leading to failure or opposition. The last attempt was a deep water plan that was stopped in the 1960s. Mayor Tom Bradley publicly stated \\"The Venice Canals will not be improved in my lifetime.\\" After Ruth Galanter was elected, she stated that she was not happy with the environmental aspects, the costs, the historical design and the safety of the vertical wall plan, so one of her early actions was to stop the city engineers from pursuing the vertical wall plan. Galanter asked the state agency California Coastal Conservancy to review the options for a canal improvement project. The Coastal Conservancy made several plans suggestions, including one using Armorflex. Armorflex was a cement material connected by cables and had holes allowing for plant growth and a gentle slope. A test site was installed on Eastern bank of Sherman Canal near the Dell Ave. Bridge. The Armorflex test site turned out to be a failure, with the plants not growing out of the block, and it looked awful aesthetically. The majority of the neighbor who would be assessed by the new design were now opposed to the Armorflex plan, and in a poll stated that they would rather have no plan than one that included Armorflex. A poll by the City of Los Angeles found that over 79 percent of the homeowners opposed the assessment project using the Armorflex material. After being elected, Ruth Galanter held several meetings with the Venice Canals Association under the leadership of Mark Galanty about the Canal improvement project. Galanter had said she would be open to other plans, but for the time she would continue the Armorflex design. Based on public meetings and city polling it was clear that the Armorflex plan would not be approved by the property owners and the project would fail again. Mark Galanty assembled a committee of the VCA to locate a compromise design and material. Loffelstein, or Loffel Block, was identified by a VCA committee member Andy Shores as possibly meeting those goals. It allowed plants to grow inside the material, could be placed on a slope to allow birds and wildlife to climb out of the canals, was safe for small children as it allowed them to hold on to the sides, and or climb out of the Canals, was lower cost project over the Armorflex design, and was aesthetically pleasing to the property owners. Mark Galanty recruited canal resident architects to create a design board with the Loffel Block material, and Galanty publicly presented the Loffel design Plan at a public meeting with Councilwoman Galanter in attendance. Galanter stated she would be open to the Venice Canals Association design material. Mark Galanty got the Loffel Block distributor in Orange County to install a test site across from the Armorflex test site at the distributors cost. The test was successful with plants growing in the blocks, wildlife and ducks able to climb up the material, and the majority of the property owners supporting this design. Galanter agreed to have city engineers design an official city plan using the Loffel Block. Luis Ganajas revised the plans to include the material Loffel Block at 55 degree slope. VCA members Robert Trask and Mark Galanty took the city design, an actual Loffel Block, and the community support poll showing overwhelming support to different Venice groups, city government agencies, state agencies, environmental groups, historical groups, and each property owner on the canals getting support for what was termed \\"The Compromise Plan\\". Eventually, letters of support for the Loffel plan were presented to the city from the Sierra Club, Heal the Bay, the local state senator and state assemblyman, both U.S. senators, and the local county supervisor. Based on the support of the Loffel Block design over the Armorflex design, Councilwoman Galanter had Public Works drop the Armorflex plan and focusd on the Loffel Block plan. Councilwoman Galanter and staff member Jim Bichart, as well as city engineer Luis Ganajas and environmental engineer Russ Ruffing worked on the city, state and national approvals. At the Coastal Commission hearing the Venice Canals Association supported the plan, and there was finally no opposition to the restoring of the Venice Canals. The estimated costs for the improvements was 6.3 million dollars, and included dredging the canals and removing the soil to a class 1 toxic site, removing crumbling sidewalks, replacing with new sidewalks, 5 feet deep in center, 1 1/2 feed on the sides, Loffel black at 55 degrees through the canals. Rebuilding the foot bridges that go over the canals. The City Engineers designed Atriplex, aka Salt Bush,as a natural hedge along the canal banks as a safety barrier to the canals. The property owners in the canals paid approximately $6,600 over a 10 year-period for a 30 by 90 foot lot frontage, and $7,800 for a 40 by 90 foot lot frontage. Work began in March 1992, and was completed in 1993. The assessment could be paid in full, or paid over time with interest at approximately 5%.Jeffrey Stanton Book Venice California 'Coney Island of the Pacific' 2005 =San Fernando Valley= In July 2002, the City Council voted to move Galanter's entire 6th District into the East San Fernando Valley, including Arleta, Sun Valley and parts of Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Panorama City and Pacoima, because of the increase of population in the Valley. At first opposed to the move, Galanter later embraced it and \\"unveiled an ambitious plan to curb flooding in Sun Valley, remove hundreds of pieces of discarded furniture throughout the district, repair streets and energize the political culture of a district known for voter apathy.\\"James Nash, \\"Leaving Office Ruth Galanter Offers Some Advice,\\" Los Angeles Daily News, June 30, 2003 Galanter worked with the community to get a $50,000 sculpture installed at Van Nuys Airport‚Äî\\"a piece of public art demanded by some people who were outraged over a series of bronze statues that they said were a poor fit for the airport.\\" The Los Angeles Daily News reported that: > Galanter said the project represents the first time a Los Angeles community > was able to select the kind of art it wanted under the city's program that > funnels 1 percent of developers' fees to public art.

The title refers to a line in Psalm 90. It was first published in 1958 by Macmillan of Canada. Plot summary George and Catherine Stewart share not only the burden of Catherine's heart disease, which could cause her death at any time, but the memory of Jerome Martell, her first husband and George's closest friend. Martell, a brilliant doctor passionately concerned with social justice, is presumed to have died in a Nazi prison camp. His sudden return to Montreal precipitates the central crisis of the novel. Hugh MacLennan takes the reader into the lives of his three characters and back into the world of Montreal in the thirties, when politics could send an idealist across the world to Spain, France, Auschwitz, Russia, and China before his return home. Title The title is a reference to a line in Isaac Watts' Our God, Our Help in Ages Past: A thousand ages in Thy sight Are like an evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun. This echoes the theme of mortality that is central to the plot of the novel. The hymn and the psalm as a whole contrast the brevity and struggle of human life with the eternity of God (and, in Christian interpretation, of life everlasting after death). Reception The novel was a Canadian bestseller for almost four months in 1959. MacLennan received $70,000 in film rights. Robertson Davies declared \\"The Canadian novel takes a great stride forward.\\" It is considered to be MacLennan's best novel, and an important Canadian novel. The novel earned MacLennan the Canadian Governor General's Award for literature. A passage from the book was adapted for use in the song \\"Courage (for Hugh MacLennan)\\" by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. A number of elements from the novel are believed to reflect MacLennan's life. Catherine Stewart is believed to have been inspired by MacLennan's first wife, Dorothy Duncan, who was dying of the same ailment Catherine suffers from while MacLennan was writing the novel. Another major character, Jerome Martell, is generally thought to have been inspired by Norman Bethune, a claim the author denied. MacLennan's biographer, Elspeth Cameron, points to F. R. Scott and Samuel MacLennan, the author's father, as models for Martell. However, Mr. MacLennan, in a 1965 newspaper article referring to his neurologist, Dr. Reuben Rabinovitch of Montreal wrote: ‚ÄúWhen my novel, ‚ÄòThe Watch That Ends The Night,‚Äô appeared, it was widely believed that its doctor- protagonist, Dr. Jerome Martell, was modeled on the famous Dr. Norman Bethune. He wasn‚Äôt, for I never knew Bethune. But Martell‚Äôs way of dealing with his patients was Dr. Rab‚Äôs way. This is not to suggest that Martell was modeled off him; he wasn‚Äôt. But if I had not known Dr. Rab, I could never have understood Dr. Martell.\\" Dr. Martell's life history was also notably quite similar to that of Dr. Rabinovitch. Douglas Gibson, Hugh MacLennan's friend and publisher, wrote: \\"Hugh later suggested that a real-life model for Jerome Martell was actually Frank Scott, the poet, McGill Law School scholar, and leader of Montreal left-wing politics who became one of the founders of the CCF party.\\" References * Brian Busby, Character Parts: Who's Really Who in Canlit, Toronto: Knopf, 2003. p. 163-164, 171, 245. . * Hugh MacLennan, noted Canadian author, pays tribute to the late Dr. Rabinovitch, in Canadian Jewish Review, October 22, 1965.

He was a member of the Los Angeles City Council, representing the 1st district.Citywatch, July 21, 2011 Reyes was re-elected in 2005 to serve a second Council term, capturing 78 percent of the votes. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He has a background in urban planning. Career In response to safety concerns, Reyes, vice-chair of the Public Safety Committee, has secured funds for added Los Angeles Police Department units and technology, graffiti and neighborhood clean-ups, gang prevention programs and safe route school maps. In September 2008, Reyes opened the new Rampart Division police station, one of the nation's busiest police stations, and the City's \\"greenest\\" police station because of its LEED Gold-rated designation. In October 2002, and shortly after William Bratton became the city's top cop, Reyes brought the Los Angeles Police Department Police Chief to MacArthur Park to witness firsthand the drug deals, gang activity and shootings there. That tour resulted in a nationally recognized LAPD effort - consisting of surveillance cameras and boosted patrols‚Äîthat transformed one of the City's most blighted parks into a popular spot for family picnics, festivals and concerts. Crime at MacArthur Park has dropped 20 percent since Reyes launched the crime-fighting project, a joint effort with the community, local businesses and LAPD. Earlier in his tenure, Reyes also launched a nationally renowned lead abatement program to protect children from the dangers of lead- based paint found in pre-1979 housing. He spearheaded the $160 million Northeast Interceptor Sewer tunnel to prevent sewage overflow and protect the health of families and children. As Chair of the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management committee, Reyes has expanded the City's affordable housing stock. He has pushed for Adaptive Reuse, or the conversion of abandoned buildings into housing, and Residential and Accessory Services, which permits residential development in commercial zones. And he has spearheaded efforts to strengthen the city's rent control ordinance. As chair of the Metro Gold Line Authority he also helped ensure that the $750 million Gold Line project be completed on time and on budget. Reyes has opened four new libraries in Cypress Park, Chinatown, Highland Park and Pico-Union and has added more than of new park space to his district. As chair of the Los Angeles River Ad Hoc Committee, he has brought a renewed focus to the once-ignored Los Angeles River and secured more than $3 million to create a neighborhood-driven plan that will include enhancing water quality, environmental protection, increasing open space and improving flood control. Reyes attended University of California, Los Angeles where he earned a bachelor's degree in English and a master's degree from UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning. He lives in the northeast Los Angeles community of Mt. Washington with his wife Martha and their four children. In 2016, Reyes endorsed a non- profit called CityWarts in an appearance on Comedy Central's television show Nathan For You.

The company was started in August 2004 using the molds and machinery from bankrupt Bryco Arms and made six models of firearm. Under its Bryco name, the company was described by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms as one of the inexpensive firearm manufacturers known as the \\"Ring of Fire\\" companies. All firearms manufactured by Jimenez Arms are constructed of injection-molded Zamak, a zinc alloy. Jimenez Arms filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2020. History=Jennings Firearms A Jennings J-22 pistol in .22LR caliber. Jennings Firearms was founded in 1978 by Bruce Jennings, the son of Raven Arms founder George Jennings. After declaring bankruptcy, the company was renamed Bryco Arms, but the Jennings name was retained for many years even while Bryco Arms used its own brand name for firearms. Bryco Arms Bryco Arms was the successor company to Jennings Firearms, a U.S. firearm manufacturing company, based at various times in Carson City, Nevada, Irvine, California, and Costa Mesa, California. The company's most famous product, along with the Jennings J-22, was the Bryco Arms Model 38 semi-automatic pistol, available in both 32 ACP and 380 ACP calibers (also known as the P-38). As with Jennings, the company was owned by Bruce Jennings. Bryco Arms was one of several manufacturers of so-called Saturday night special firearms based in the Los Angeles, California vicinity, descended from George Jennings' Raven Arms. It produced firearms variously branded as Jennings Firearms at its Irvine, California facility, as well as under the brand name of Bryco Arms at its former Carson City, Nevada facility, and at its Costa Mesa, California facility. Bryco Arms declared bankruptcy in 2003 as a result of losing a lawsuit filed in Oakland, California and which resulted in a jury award of a record $24 million judgment against Bryco Arms. The lawsuit stemmed from an injury to a then 7-year-old boy named Brandon Maxfield received from a 20-year-old family friend who was attempting to unload the 380 ACP version of the Bryco Arms Model 38.https://web.archive.org/web/20181022151929/http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la- me-brandon-maxfield-20161118-story.html The pistol discharged while the 20-year-old was attempting to clear the chamber, the gun inadvertently pointed at Maxfield. The discharge paralyzed Brandon Maxfield from the neck down. The plaintiffs convinced the court that due to a design defect, the gun had a cartridge feed problem, made evident when the safety was on and the user pulled back the slide to check the chamber or load a cartridge into the chamber. Rather than re-design the gun to correct the jamming problem, the instruction manual for the weapon was changed to require that the safety be placed in the fire position when checking the chamber or chambering a cartridge, which hid the problem from the user. Jimenez Arms Bryco's former factory foreman, Paul Jimenez, bought the bankrupt Bryco Arms for $510,000 in August 2004, and renamed the company Jimenez Arms. Operations resumed in Costa Mesa, California. Jimenez Arms later ceased California operations and on August 30, 2006, a license was granted for Jimenez Arms to commence operation in Henderson, Nevada, and production resumed there. Lawsuit Kansas City, Missouri, sued the company in 2020 for alleged trafficking. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2020.

After Lauren Agnelli answered an ad for a \\"CBGB type band\\" in The Village Voice, she and Shaun Brighton met one night at CBGB and discovered a connection in a mutual appreciation for other new wave bands playing at the time, including Talking Heads, The Cramps, and The Velvet Underground. Agnelli had been working as a rock critic for The Village Voice and Creem magazine under the pen name Trixie A. Balm. Soon joined by Miriam Linna, drumming for the Cramps at the time and later, Jonathan Gildersleeve, Nervus Rex started to develop an uptempo pop sound focusing on driving surf guitar twang and danceable rhythms. Their initial bass player, Lew Eklund, left the band shortly after Gildersleeve joined. Artist and Ohio transplant, Dianne Athey, took over on the bass after Eklund left, and soon added to the group musically and in terms of image. In 1978 the band released a single on the Cleverly Named Record Company, a 45 RPM \\"Don't Look\\" b/w \\"Love Affair.\\" Two years later, Blondie producer Mike Chapman and his partner, Nicky Chinn (Chinnichap), signed the band to the Dreamland label. Nervus Rex only released a single album on Dreamland, the 1980s self-titled Nervus Rex. That release, having been on hold for a year while the dynamic new wave music scene flourished with talented contemporaries like the B-52's booming in popularity, the Nervus Rex debut release met with little success and the band continued playing in clubs for several more years before breaking up in the early 1980s. Nervus Rex played on double bills with The Pretenders, Squeeze, The Bloodless Pharaohs (Brian Setzer's first band), and Richard Hell and the Voidoids. After the band's demise, Agnelli joined the Washington Squares, a new generation beat folkgroup who released two LP's and earned a Grammy nomination. She went on to play with the Dave Rave Conspiracy in the U.S. and Canada as well as the duo Agnelli & Rave, and was co-writer and featured vocalist on \\"Kiss of Fire,\\" an album released in the U.S. and Japan, by Brave Combo. More recently she has enjoyed a solo career with a CD release in 2004 on the BongoBeat label, \\"Love Always Follows Me.\\" In 2011, she co-produces Small Town Concert Series with her husband in CT and they have a 5-piece Americana Group, Amalgamated Muck, who play frequent shows and are working on their first release. Agnelli also continues to write songs and record with Dave Rave as co-writer and co- producer. Shaun Brighton (now Shawn Brighton) went on to form The Puppets, a band whose hit dance single \\"The Way of Life\\" on Canadian company Quality Records reached the No. 3 position on the Billboard Dance Chart, went to No. 1 on the regional New York charts, and fared even better in Canada. There are, in fact, at least six known different mixes of the song on vinyl and CD from various countries. The band toured briefly to major audiences but soon disbanded due to both internal disagreements and legal problems between the producers, Quality Records, and Shawn Brighton as to ownership issues. Dianne Athey's band after \\"the Rex\\" was The Riddles, led by Karen LeSage (formerly of The Gloo Girls). The Riddles worked from 1999 to 2004, playing gigs and recording. She currently works as a fine art painter and graphic artist for Town & Country. In 2010, Brighton moved to Miami Beach, where he works as an art dealer, creates art and continues to write songs. A possible musical reunion with Agnelli, Brighton, and bassist Athey is under discussion.

It is an alternative to other contemporary Western burial methods and funerary customs.  Overview A natural burial grave site. The existing landscape is modified as little as possible. Only flat stone markers are allowed. The body may be prepared without chemical preservatives or disinfectants such as embalming fluid, which might destroy the microbial decomposers that break the body down. It may be buried in a biodegradable coffin, casket, or shroud. The grave does not use a burial vault or outer burial container that would prevent the body's contact with soil. The grave should be shallow enough to allow microbial activity similar to that found in composting. Natural burials can take place both on private land (subject to regulations) and in any cemetery that will accommodate the vault-free technique. While all natural burials seek to prevent environmental damage done by conventional techniques, some go a step further by using burial fees to acquire land to restore native habitat and save endangered species. Such land management techniques are called \\"conservation burials.\\" In addition to restoration ecology, and habitat conservation projects, others have proposed alternative natural uses of the land such as sustainable agriculture and permaculture, to maintain the burial area in perpetuity. Landscaping methods may accelerate or slow down the decomposition rate of bodies, depending on the soil system. The first official conservation burial was established in the United States, however Natural Burial Grounds have been used previously in UK and the practice matches the methods used in many ancient and indigenous cultures.  Environmental issues with conventional burial  Each year, 22,500 cemeteries across the United States bury approximately:(Compiled from statistics by Casket and Funeral Association of America, Cremation Association of North America, Doric Inc., The Rainforest Action Network, and Mary Woodsen, Pre-Posthumous Society) *30 million board feet (70,000 m3) of hardwood caskets *90,272 tons of steel caskets *14,000 tons of steel vaults *2,700 tons of copper and bronze caskets *1,636,000 tons of reinforced concrete vaults *827,060 US gallons (3,130 m3) of embalming fluid, which usually includes formaldehyde.Embalming fluid chemically changes in the act of preserving the body and is not largely present as a fluid. This figure refers to embalming fluid before it is introduced to the body. When formaldehyde is used for embalming, it breaks down, and the chemicals released into the ground after burial and ensuing decomposition are inert. The problems with the use of formaldehyde and its constituent components in natural burial are the exposure of mortuary workers to it and the killing of the decomposer microbes necessary for breakdown of the body in the soil. Coffins (tapered-shoulder shape) and caskets (rectangular) are made from a variety of materials, most of them not biodegradable. 80‚Äì85% of the caskets sold for burial in North America in 2006 were of stamped steel. Solid wood and particle board (chipboard) coffins with hardwood veneers account for 10‚Äì15% of sales, and fiberglass and alternative materials such as woven fiber make up the rest. In Australia 85‚Äì90% of coffins are solid wood and particle board. Most traditional caskets in the UK are made from chipboard covered in a thin veneer. Handles are usually plastic designed to look like brass. Chipboard requires glue to stick the wood particles together. Some glues that are used, such as those that contain formaldehyde, are feared to cause pollution when they are burned during cremation or when degrading in the ground. However, not all engineered wood products are produced using formaldehyde glues. Caskets and coffins are often manufactured using exotic and even endangered species of wood, and are designed to prevent decomposition. While there are generally no restrictions on the type of coffin used, most sites encourage the use of environmentally friendly coffins made from materials like cane, bamboo, wicker or fiberboard.Bamboo Coffins \\"Coffin- maker resurrects tradition\\", from BBC Business News, published 2001-12-28 A weight bearing shroud is another option.  Memorialization  Natural burial grounds employ a variety of methods of memorialization. Families that bury their loved ones in nature preserves can record the GPS coordinates of the location where they are buried, without using physical markers. Some natural burial sites use flat wooden plaques, or a name written on a natural rock. Many families plant trees, or other native plants near the grave to provide a living memorial. Alternative methods of burial Alternatives to ground burials include burial in a coral reef, sky burial and burial at sea. Coral reefs Cremated remains are sometimes placed inside concrete coral reef balls, and ceremoniously placed in the sea as part of a reef ecosystem. These balls are used to repair damage to coral reefs, and to provide new habitat for fish and other sea life. Sky burial In some parts of Tibet and Mongolia, a person's remains are fed to vultures in a burial known as Sky burial. This is seen as being good to the environment as well as good karma in Buddhism. Burial at sea Burial at sea is seen as a natural burial if done in a way that benefits the environment, and without formaldehyde. Some organizations specialize in natural burial at sea (in a shroud), allowing the body to decompose or be consumed by animals.  Locations  Natural burial has been practiced for thousands of years, but has been interrupted in modern times by new methods such as vaults, liners, embalming, and mausoleums that mitigate the decomposition process. In the late 19th century Sir Francis Seymour Hayden proposed \\"earth to earth burial\\" in a pamphlet of the same name, as an alternative to both cremation and the slow putrefaction of encased corpses.  United Kingdom  The Association of Natural Burial Grounds (ANBG) was established by The Natural Death Centre charity in 1994. It aims to help people to establish sites, to provide guidance to natural burial ground operators, to represent its members, and to provide a Code of Conduct for members. The NDC also publishes The Natural Death Handbook. The first woodland burial ground in the UK was created in 1993 at Carlisle Cemetery and is called The Woodland Burial. Nearly 300 dedicated natural burial grounds have been created in the UK.  Canada  Each province and territory within Canada has its own resources and regulations for handling death and the disposal of the body. In British Columbia, green burials are treated the same way as traditional burials, as embalming is not legally required for interment. All burials are required to follow the regulations set forth by their respective provincial government. With growing interest in promoting eco-friendly practices, natural burials have been making rounds in various Canadian news outlets. Some debate still lies in what makes certain funeral practices eco- friendly and how cemeteries make these claims as no government-imposed standard or definition currently exist. Eco-friendly funeral practices in Canada can include: * Burial at sea * Tree planting * Green/natural burials Canada offers a wide range of environmentally friendly services and alternatives to conventional funerary customs and corpse disposal practices in Canada. The Green Burial Council is an environmental certification organization for green burials practiced in North America (Canada and the US). Environmental certificates are offered to cemeteries, funeral homes, and product manufacturers involved in the funeral industry. These certificates would allow consumers to distinguish between the three different levels of green burial grounds and their appropriate standards. The Green Burial Council also offers information on the types of coffins, urns, and embalming tools that would fall under the eco-friendly category and be available for North American consumers. The Green Burial Society of Canada was founded in 2013 with the goal to ensure standards of certification are set for green burial practices. The society emphasizes five principles of green burial: no embalming, direct earth burial, ecological restoration and conservation, communal memorialization, and the optimization of land use. The Natural Burial Association (NBA) is an independent, non-profit organization established in 2005 to promote natural burial in Canada and to encourage the establishment of natural burial sites. The organization lists the four current natural cemetery sites on their website located in: Victoria, British Columbia, Cobourg, Ontario, Brampton, Ontario, and Pickering, Ontario. Royal Oak Burial Park and Little Saanich Mountain in Victoria, British Columbia. = Royal Oak Burial Park = Located in Victoria, British Columbia, the Royal Oak Burial Park opened the Woodlands grave site for green burial space in the cemetery since October 2008, dedicating its space to burials that allow for the natural decomposition of human remains which in turn provides nutrients for the surrounding ecosystem. The area has native-growing Coastal Douglas Fir along with a variety of ecologically similar tree species, which the cemetery claims to keep as close to the natural ecosystem as possible. In order to be interred in Royal Oak Burial Park, embalming of the body is prohibited. The body must be kept in its natural state, which is then placed in some form of biodegradable container or shroud. Traditional grave markers are not used, but rather families are given options to engrave natural boulders or plants. = Union Cemetery = Found in Cobourg, Ontario, the Cobourg Union Cemetery is located on 20 acres of land, currently containing 3,800 burial lots. The cemetery is made up of both traditional burials with headstones and regular interment practices, as well as a green space dedicated to eco-friendly burials. Consumers are given information about biodegradable caskets and procedures for a green burial. Families are not allowed to place permanent markers on the grave sites other than native species of plants such as flowers and bushes. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visiting the Meadowvale Cemetery in Brampton, Ontario in 2013. = Meadowvale Cemetery = The Meadowvale Cemetery originally opened in 1981 in Brampton, Ontario, with the green burial section of the cemetery opening in 2012. The cemetery allows for both burial and cremation as long as embalming is done without formaldehyde or other harsh chemicals. They also ensure that remains are placed into a non- toxic, biodegradable container. Graves are not allowed to be marked with traditional headstones, but they offer a granite stone at the site's entrance for name engraving. = Duffin Meadows Cemetery = Duffin Meadows Cemetery is located in Pickering, Ontario, and is attached to the original traditional cemetery. The cemetery offers natural burials for individuals who have been embalmed to eco-friendly standards, then interred using biodegradable shrouds and caskets. Grave sites will be left to grow over naturally, meaning grass will not be mowed and the placement of artificial flowers and other markers will not be allowed.  Australia  There are a number of different natural burial parks across Australia, each of them slightly different in what they offer. One of the more advanced parks is Lake Macquarie Memorial Park, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, which contains a Natural Memorial reserve dedicated to natural burials.  New Zealand  New Zealand's Natural Burial organisation was started in 1999 by Mark Blackham. It is a not-for-profit organization that advocates for natural cemeteries, promotes the concept to the public, and certifies cemeteries, funeral directors and caskets for use in participating cemeteries.Natural Burials, New Zealand The first natural cemetery in New Zealand was established in 2008 in the capital, Wellington,Wellington City Council, 'Wellington's new Natural Cemetery officially opened by Mayor Kerry Prendergast'. 30 May 2008. http://www.wellington.govt.nz/news/display-item.php?id=3217 as a partnership between the Wellington City Council and Natural Burials. It is the nation's biggest natural cemetery, covering approx 2 hectares, and home to 120 burials (April 2015). More natural cemeteries have since been set up by between Natural Burials and the council authorities in New Plymouth in 2011,≈åtaki in 2012. and Marlborough in 2014. Other councils have set up small natural burial zones: Marsden Valley in 2011, Motueka in 2012, and Hamilton in 2014.http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-services/cemetery- services/burialservices/Documents/Forest%20Grove%20Natural%20Burial%20Area%20website%20brochure.pdf Although these have all based on the approach used by Natural Burials, they have not been certified by the organisation.  United States  The Green Burial Council (GBC) is an independent, tax-exempt, nonprofit organization that aims to encourage sustainability in the interment industry and to use burial as a means of ecological restoration and landscape conservation. Founded in 2005, the GBC has been stewarded by individuals representing the environmental/conservation community, consumer organizations, academia, the deathcare industry, and such organizations and institutions as The Nature Conservancy, The Trust for Public Land, AARP, and the University of Colorado. The organization established the nation's first certifiable standards for cemeteries, funeral providers, burial product manufacturers, and cremation facilities. As of 2013, there are a total of 37 burial grounds certified by the Green Burial Council in 23 states and British Columbia. A cemetery becomes certified by demonstrating compliance with stringent established standards for a given category. Ramsey Creek Preserve mentioned below is certified by the GBC. Conventional funeral providers in thirty-nine states now offer the burial package approved by the Green Burial Council. California: Most of the Fernwood Burial Ground, adjacent to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in Mill Valley, California, is set aside for natural burial, with no tombstones or caskets. Purissima Cemetery located in Half Moon Bay, California is a natural burial cemetery located south of Half Moon Bay California. Florida: Prairie Creek Conservation Cemetery in Gainesville, Florida was the state's first conservation burial ground. The 93-acre preserve is protected in partnership with local nonprofit conservation organization, Alachua Conservation Trust. The space is actively managed and being restored to diverse prairie and hardwood forest. New Jersey: Steelmantown Cemetery is the only cemetery in the State of New Jersey certified and approved by the Green Burial Council as a Level 3 Natural Burial Ground. Ohio: Foxfield Preserve, adjacent to The Wilderness Center's headquarters near Wilmot, Ohio, was the first nature preserve cemetery in the US to be operated by a nonprofit conservation organization. Naturalists from The Wilderness Center have restored this formerly agricultural land to native prairie grasses and wildflowers. A section has also been reforested in native hardwood trees. Kokosing Nature Preserve is a conservation burial ground located in the picturesque countryside of Gambier, Ohio. A project of the Philander Chase Conservancy, Kenyon College's land trust, the preserve offers a natural burial option on twenty-three acres of restored prairies and woodlands. Maine: Cedar Brook Burial Ground in Limington, Maine, the first green cemetery in Maine is located on a 150-acre tree farm thirty miles due west of Portland. Within its borders sits the rock wall-enclosed Joshua Small Cemetery, a tiny, historic graveyard whose dozen burials date back to the early 1800s. Oregon: River View Cemetery, located in Portland, Oregon, is registered with the Green Burial Council as a \\"hybrid\\" natural burial cemetery. Rather than restricting natural burials to just one specific section, River View permits natural burial in nearly every area of the cemetery, allowing those who wish to be interred in existing family plots without an outer burial container, without embalming, or even without a casket if they choose to do so. Pennsylvania: Penn Forest Natural Burial Park is the first Natural Burial Grounds in Pennsylvania certified by the Green Burial Council. Burial sites comprise 2.5 acres of the property. South Carolina: Billy Campbell, a rural doctor and a pioneer of the green burial movement in the US, opened the first modern \\"green cemetery\\" in North America at the Ramsey Creek Preserve in South Carolina in 1998. This cemetery was opened to allow for burials where bodies are not embalmed or cremated, because of concern about the negative impacts that the chemicals and processes of these funeral preparation methods may have on the environment‚Äîwhich is why it is considered \\"green.\\" Texas: Countryside Memorial Park located near Marion, Texas southeast of San Antonio is a natural, green burial park. All burials occur at a depth of approximately 3 to 3¬Ω feet and have a 2-3 foot mound of earth above them. This depth ensures that the nutrient layer is raised to a higher soil stratum where microbes and oxygen can expedite the decomposition process. Each burial is covered by approximately 60 inches of soil and is undetectable to human or animal noses (with the exception of bears, which are not an issue in Texas). Countryside was incorporated as a cemetery in 1991 but several pioneers were buried on the property previously, the latest being interred in 1869.http://files.usgwarchives.net/tx/wilson/photos/tombstones/beall/historic7176gph.txt At 1 1/2 acres, thus far 300 plots have been surveyed. It is primarily a meadow, though there are some mature oak trees on the property, with plans for additional tree planting on designated plots. Cattle graze the park in season. Eloise Woods Community Natural Burial Park, established in 2010 located in a wooded preserve near Cedar Creek, Texas southeast of Austin, Texas, includes walking trails to allow the community to enjoy the beauty of the preserve. Burials are only permitted in areas that will not degrade the land. Some areas of the preserve are ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù whereas other areas are suitable for cremated remains. These decisions are based on what is best for the ecological restoration of the preserve. The total land for the preserve is less than 10 acres. Tennessee: Larkspur Conservation is Tennessee's first nature preserve for natural burial. Located just outside Nashville, this conservation burial ground protects 112 acres of rare mixed-mesophytic forest and prairie in partnership with The Nature Conservancy. Wisconsin: Circle Cemetery, located at Circle Sanctuary Nature Preserve in southwestern Wisconsin, has offered burial of cremated remains and non-embalmed bodies since 1995. It is operated by Circle Sanctuary, a Wiccan church.  Religious practices  Jewish law forbids embalming for traditional burials, which it considers to be desecration of the body. The body is ritually washed by select members of the Jewish community, wrapped in either a linen or muslin sheet, and placed in an all-wood casket. The casket must not have any metal in it, and it often has holes in the bottom to ensure that it and the cadaver rapidly decompose and return to the earth. Burial vaults are not used unless required by the cemetery. In Israel, Jews are buried without a casket, in just the shroud. Islamic law instructs that the deceased be washed and buried with only a wrapping of white cloth to preserve dignity. The cloth is sometimes perfumed, but as in natural burial, no chemical preservatives or embalming fluid are used, nor is there a burial vault, coffin or casket. There is no legal requirements for using a coffin in the UK and a body can be buried in a cloth if desired.  In the media  Toward the end of its final season in 2005, the HBO series Six Feet Under prominently featured natural burial. 2014 documentary A Will for the Woods explores natural burial, primarily through the lens of one terminally ill North Carolina man's decision to have one.

Career Elected in 1991 in a special election to complete the unfinished term of previous Councilmember Gloria Molina who had moved on to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Hernandez became only the fourth Latino elected to the Los Angeles City Council since the election of Edward Roybal in 1948. While in office Hernandez, much to the chagrin of his then council colleagues, often reminded his constituents and the Latino community at-large that his district was the result of a landmark court case mandating that a Latino district be created because of the gerrymandering that had occurred in previous decades. While drawing much of his early electoral support from voters of the Northeast Los Angeles communities that made up much of his district, Hernandez represented some of the poorest areas of the city including MacArthur Park, Westlake and Pico Union. Regardless, Hernandez understood that each of the neighborhoods he represented were largely young immigrant communities that had been all but forgotten by civic leaders. With limited social infrastructure and almost no access to city resources Hernandez, a trained organizer, began to unite community leaders and together during his decade-long tenure between 1991 and 2001, either spearheaded or laid the groundwork for much of the transformations that have since occurred in what was once his district. Zones of Need Shortly after his election, Hernandez quickly began to build the argument, as if one needed to be made, that his district was people rich and resource poor. In order to do this, Hernandez turned to the most recent census data and created a series of maps he deemed ‚Äúthe Zones of Need‚Äù that he released in the Fall of 1992.‚ÄúHernandez‚Ä¶ called for greater attention by city government to ‚Äòzones of need‚Äô--neighborhoods that suffer disproportionately from poverty, substandard housing, unemployment and lack of education. Hernandez released demographic studies to more precisely delineate the substandard socioeconomic zones, including much of his own 1st District near downtown. ‚Äú[Los Angeles Times-CALIFORNIA  LOCAL: LOS ANGELES : More Aid Is Urged for 'Zones of Need' October 15, 1992] This data acted as a launching point for much of the legislation Hernandez was to champion during his early years as a council member and gave weight to the argument that his district was being short-changed causing one writer to note about Hernandez:‚ÄúWhat unsettled many of the council members about Hernandez was that he seriously tried to argue that the wealthier neighborhoods took the resources that should be used in the inner city.‚Äù [Anything But Mexican, Chicanos In Contemporary Los Angeles by Rodolfo Acuna] Pasadena Gold Line Indeed, early in his tenure Hernandez was immediately challenged by the impending arrival of what was then referred to as the Pasadena Blue Line (now called the Pasadena Gold Line). Officials at the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) had originally intended the line to traverse the Northeast Los Angeles communities of Highland Park, Cypress Park and Lincoln Heights at speeds upwards of 60 miles per hour. Moreover, plans for the line included the construction of an 18-foot ‚Äòsound wall‚Äô, an above grade separation at North Figueroa Street and Marmion Way and limited stations along the line. An angry Hernandez who often noted that the five freeway off-ramps in his district were designed for commuters trying to pass through his communities rather than for the people who actually lived in them, publicly denounced the Blue Line Plans as more of the same. More importantly however, as the council representative for the area, Hernandez clearly understood his land-use discretion and that if the light rail was to traverse his district, then the residents of the impacted neighborhoods were going to have a voice in its development. Finally, after years of back-and-forth negotiation between the now Gold-Line authority (of which Hernandez was also a part), and Northeast Los Angeles residents, construction plans were adopted that eliminated the 18-foot sound wall that Hernandez and residents argued only served to separate neighborhoods and act as a potential graffiti wall for area taggers; slowed the train down to a maximum speed of just over 30 miles an hour; included a brand new stations in Chinatown, Avenue 26, French Avenue and at the foot of the Southwest Museum in Mount Washington near what was to become a child-care center at the historic Zeigler House Mansion which Hernandez also created, and forced the train to go underground as opposed to above-grade at the corner of Figueroa Street and Marmion Way. Taylor Yard Shortly after taking office, Hernandez threatened to file suit against the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) who, during the 5-month hiatus of any representation between the time Gloria Molina moved to the County Board of Supervisors and Hernandez was elected to replace her, constructed a maintenance facility at a nearby rail yard without producing an Environmental Impact Report (EIR). As part of the settlement, LACTC agreed to fund a series of community workshops for local residents. In one of the most ambitious undertakings in his young administration which would ultimately lead to a wholesale change of the Northeast Los Angeles community of Cypress Park where he grew up, Hernandez put a call out to his community to attend critical planning meetings, an announcement which was picked up and published thus in the Los Angeles Times on November 12, 1992:\\"Councilman Mike Hernandez has organized a three-day public workshop, beginning Friday, for area residents to discuss development of the 250-acre Taylor Yard. Representatives from the American Institute of Architects will interview participants about what types of projects would best serve the public's needs. The architects will include the comments in a report to Hernandez, which will guide him in discussions with prospective developers‚Ä¶‚Äù [Los Angeles Times NEWS -Northeast L.A. : Workshops on Taylor Yard, November 12, 1992] The workshops were funded by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) who were forced to do so under threat of a lawsuit by the City of Los Angeles which Hernandez initiated. Beyond the changes that the report would finally bring to the community, also key was the manner in which each of the meetings was conducted. Long considered a disinterested community by other political leaders who had little connection to the largely Latino and mono-lingual Spanish speaking community, Hernandez and his staff ensured meetings were extremely well attended and that they be conducted in both English and Spanish. Large cafeteria length tables were laid out and maps of the entire 250 acres of land were depicted. Residents were advised about zoning restrictions but were encouraged to envision what the dilapidated railroad yard could one day look like. They were then given post- its and encouraged to write down what they would like to see take hold and place it where they would like to see it. While this may have been commonplace in other communities, in 1992 such had never been the case in this particular area of the city. These meetings also laid the groundwork for future community input meetings whereby Hernandez would often need to bully departments to bring their resources out to the community turning nearly each of Hernandez‚Äô evening community meetings into was is today commonly referred as community resource fairs. The ensuing report known locally as the Taylor Yard Study, set-forth in motion a series of historic changes that today have resulted in the creation of acres of park space, community housing, local high schools and a thriving supermarket. Proposition K In 1996, Hernandez wrote one of the last open space ballot initiatives to pass in the City of Los Angeles known as Proposition K. Hernandez, noting the initiative‚Äôs lettered named ‚ÄúK‚Äù stood for ‚ÄúKids‚Äù, traversed the City for months leading up to the election raising money for the campaign while lobbying communities, both rich and poor, throughout Los Angeles for their support. Hernandez‚Äô efforts paid off as the initiative was approved by Los Angeles voters by the narrowest of margins. Once passed, Prop K created a citywide assessment district for a term of 30 years generating $25 million each year. Funds raised through Proposition K are specifically for the acquisitions of land for open space purposes, and the improvement, construction, and maintenance of parks, recreation, childcare and community facilities. Hernandez‚Äô initiative, by the year 2026, will have raised a total of $750 million for these purposes as funds continue to be generated to this day. Immigration While immigration did not fall under the purview of the Los Angeles City Council, this did not deter Hernandez from confronting the issue head-on and being heralded, to this day, as one of the most ardent defenders of the immigrant community. Indeed, during his early tenure, particularly in the communities of MacArthur Park, Westlake and Pico Union Hernandez was highly regarded as the only Latino elected official to aggressively defend the rights of the immigrant community. Hernandez earned this reputation, in large part, for his work during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. It was during this time that Hernandez, working closely with a network of community organizations in the area, took to both the streets and local Spanish Television outlets in the early hours following the Rodney King verdicts urging peace in his district and asking residents to stay home. Residents responded to Hernandez and other community leaders which limited damage to the area until, due to a lack of resources, the Los Angeles Police Department abandoned these neighborhoods and, the city, in their stead brought in INS officials who, began conducting a series of immigration sweeps. These sweeps enraged Hernandez who within hours began to complain to his colleagues and then Mayor Tom Bradley culminating in a Hernandez sponsored City Council Resolution removing INS officials from the area altogether. Hernandez further enhanced his standing in the immigrant community two years later during the heated California Proposition 187 ballot iniative‚Äîand effort that would have prevented undocumented immigrants from receiving health care and a public education among other services. Hernandez, who in his years before taking office helped ensure that immigrants who had been detained for being undocumented would be eligible to be bonded (bail bond) out of jail, once again rose to the defense of his community. So adept had he become in debating against what he considered a hateful and racist initiative, that even the authors of the initiative and its strongest supporters outright refused to debate Hernandez publicly. Arrest and Rehabilitation In August 1997, shortly after suffering the devastating loss of his mother Beatrice ‚ÄúBea‚Äù Hernandez who had raised him by herself and with whom Hernandez spoke daily, Hernandez was apprehended by law enforcement officials (including the Los Angeles Police Department whom Hernandez would later thank for saving his life) for drug possession. Immediately thereafter, Hernandez entered a drug rehabilitation center where he began his recuperation. While calls for his resignation came from various corners of Los Angeles, including several of his own council colleagues, (one of whom years later on Hernandez last day in office would publicly apologize for having given in to the hysteria of the time) efforts to recall Hernandez from office fell flat. In fact, given the low threshold necessary to initiate a recall election, many observers outside Hernandez‚Äô district seemed dumbfounded that the issue never even made it to the ballot. But such was not the case for everyone. In an October 27, 1997 open letter to the Los Angeles Times, senior statesman and Latino political icon Edward Roybal who many considered to be the moral voice of elected Latino officials throughout Los Angeles, while acknowledging his own disappointment at hearing of Hernandez‚Äô arrest, urged people to forgive Hernandez and may have even implied Hernandez had earned their forgiveness when he wrote:‚ÄúDuring his absence, I saw what many others throughout the city saw: his constituents defending him. I think that it would be safe to say, however, that they were not so much defending him because he is a well-liked man or a \\"nice guy,\\" but rather they were defending him because of the work that he has done‚Ä¶‚Äù [Los Angeles Times/ Op-Ed; Give Hernandez a Second Chance--City Council: His district and the Latino community need him.October 27, 1997EDWARD R. ROYBAL ] Indeed, during Hernandez 10-year tenure as a Los Angeles City Councilmember Hernandez is credited with developing the social infrastructure which is still in place today and remains key to securing resources from the City, advocating for the construction of multiple libraries throughout his one-time district, advocating for the rights of children and their families and creating a three decade funding mechanism for recreation and parks throughout all Los Angeles. *Chair: Community and Economic Development Committee *Vice-Chair: Governmental Efficiency Committee *Member: Intergovernmental Relations Committee He has since worked as a staffer for former City Councilmember Nate Holden and City Councilmember Bernard Parks.

His conviction was subject to several appeals to higher courts,R v Stuart [1959 SASR 144, Supreme Court (SA). the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and a Royal Commission, all of which upheld the verdict. Newspapers campaigned successfully against the death penalty being imposed. After serving his sentence, Stuart became an Arrernte elder and from 1998 till 2001 was the chairman of the Central Land Council. In 2002, a film was made about the Stuart case. Early life Jay Creek in 1947 Stuart was born at Jay Creek in the MacDonnell Ranges, 45 kilometres west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, probably in 1932.No birth records exist and Stuart believed he was 27 years of age when arrested It was a government settlement which for a time in the late 1920s and early 1930s included 45 children from a home named 'The Bungalow' (37 of whom were under the age of 12) who were all temporarily housed in a corrugated shed, with a superintendent and matron housed separately in two tents. Jay Creek was home to the Western Arrernte people. In 1937, Jay Creek was declared one of three permanent camps or reserves for the Alice Springs Indigenous population. It was intended as a buffer between the semi-nomadic people living in far western regions and the more sophisticated inhabitants of Alice Springs and environs, in particular for the non-working, aged and infirm around Alice Springs. Legally, Stuart was a 'half-caste'As per the past uses of the terms \\"half caste\\" and \\"part Aboriginal\\" in Australian law. They are today considered offensive and no longer used. as one of his maternal great-grandfathers had been a white station owner. Stuart's paternal grandfather had been a fully initiated Arrernte and leader of a totemic clan. His father, Paddy Stuart, was also fully initiated, but as he had assumed an English surname and worked on cattle stations had not had all the secret traditions passed on to him. Max Stuart himself was fully initiated which, in 1950s Australia, was very rare for an Indigenous Australian who worked with white people. Although his sister attended the mission school, Stuart refused and had very little \\"western\\" education or knowledge of Western religion. At the age of 11, Stuart left home to work as a stockman around Alice Springs. As a teenager, he went on to work as a bare-knuckle boxer and for Jimmy Sharman's boxing tents. In late 1958, he was working on the sideshows of a travelling fun fair. He was mostly illiterate and had problems with alcohol. In late 1957, Stuart had been convicted of indecently assaulting a sleeping nine-year-old girl in Cloncurry, Queensland. In that case, he had covered his victim's mouth to prevent her screaming when she awoke; he confessed to police that he \\"knew this was wrong\\" but he did not \\"know any big women\\", and that when he had liquor he could not control himself. The Crime On Saturday 20 December 1958, Mary Olive Hattam, a nine-year-old girl, disappeared near the South Australian town of Ceduna (pop: 1,200), from Adelaide. Hattam had been playing on the beach between Ceduna and Thevenard with her brother Peter and their friend Peter Jacobsen. The two boys had left at 2:30 pm to collect a tub to use as a boat but had been distracted and failed to return. At 3:45 pm Jacobsen's father, who had been fishing, pulled his boat up at the beach where Hattam had been playing but there was no sign of her. Hattam's father went to the beach at 4 pm to collect her and then called on some neighbors to help search without success. As evening fell, Roger Cardwell, who ran the local deli and was married to Mary's cousin,Roger Cardwell was later to become a newsreader for NWS9 and went on to win the Logie Award in 1978 and 1981 for most popular television personality in South Australia. alerted the local police and Ceduna citizens, who were watching Dial M for Murder in the local Memorial Hall. A search commenced and Hattam's body was found in a small cave at 12.30 am. According to the attending doctor she had been raped, mutilated and murdered between 2.30 pm and 8 pm. At 10:30 am, the local police brought in a \\"black tracker\\" Sonny Jim, who followed tracks from Hattam's body to a nearby rockpool then back to the body, suggesting the murderer had washed off Mary's blood. He then followed tracks to where a travelling funfair, \\"Fun Land Carnival\\", had been on the previous day. The following day police brought to the site another black tracker, Harry Scott, who came to the same conclusions as Sonny Jim. Both trackers claimed that the footprints had been made by a member of a Northern Australian tribe who had spent some time living with white people. The local Aboriginal community lived at the Lutheran mission at Koonibba which was from Ceduna. As there was little work near Koonibba many families had moved to a block of land near Thevenard, where around 200 people lived in bark huts. Many had visited the funfair and were questioned by police. Several suspects were brought to the beach but were discounted from being responsible for the footprints by the trackers. Suspect The 27-year-old Rupert Max Stuart, an Arrernte man, and teenager Alan Moir had been in Ceduna on 20 December, running the darts stall for the funfair operated by Mr and Mrs Norman Gieseman. Both had gone out drinking during the day and Moir returned late that night, losing consciousness several times due to intoxication. Stuart had been arrested for drinking alcohol at 9:30 pm and was in police custody. This was because, at the time, 'full-blooded' Aboriginal people were forbidden by law to drink alcohol. In 1953 a Federal ordinance had been passed that permitted 'half-castes' to drink, but they were required to apply for a \\"certificate of exemption\\". These were commonly referred to as \\"Dog Licences\\" by Aboriginal people. Stuart had been jailed on more than one occasion for supplying alcohol to 'full-bloods'. The ban was rarely enforced in rural towns. However, since 1958, Ceduna had been combating a perceived alcohol-related \\"native problem\\" and was enforcing the alcohol ban. Although he was not drunk, Stuart had not renewed his certificate, and when arrested for drinking, was facing a sentence of 6 to 18 months in jail. He was released without charge as police resources were being dedicated to the Hattam investigation. When Stuart returned to the fair after being released the next morning, he had an argument with the Giesemans over getting 15-year- old Moir drunk and was fired. News of the murder had not reached the funfair, which packed up on Sunday morning and moved on to Whyalla where police interviewed the workers that night. Police interviewed Moir who claimed he and Stuart had been drinking with several 'half-castes' in Ceduna on Saturday morning. He had returned to the funfair at 10 am then left again at 1 pm. He told police he had seen Stuart, drunk, outside the Memorial Hall with \\"some other darkies\\". Police contacted Ceduna to question Stuart about the murder. The Stuart case When picked up on Monday, Stuart was working for the Australian Wheat Board at Thevenard, 3 kilometres east of Ceduna. During interrogation, Stuart admitted being drunk and travelling from Ceduna to Thevenard on Saturday afternoon but denied the murder. Police took him outside and made him walk barefoot across sand, after which the two trackers confirmed that Stuart's tracks matched those on the beach. Stuart later confessed and, although he could not read or write, signed his typed confession with the only English he knew, his name, written in the block letters that had been taught him by his sister, misspelling his first name as \\"ROPERT\\". Following his confession, Stuart was brought to trial in the Supreme Court of South Australia, with the case opening on 20 April 1959. The Judge presiding was Sir Geoffrey Reed, an experienced judge; Stuart's lawyer was J.D. O'Sullivan, assigned to him by the Law Society of South Australia. When arrested, Stuart had only four shillings and sixpence halfpenny ($0.45) and was thus unable to contribute to the cost of his defence. The Law Society had few resources and was unable to pay for many of the out of pocket expenses required for the defence case, such as checking Stuart's alibi, conducting forensic tests and consulting expert witnesses.In other states, a Public Solicitor would have been appointed to defend a person who could not afford to defend himself. The state government was at that time responsible for the solicitor's salary and for providing funds for out of pocket expenses. In 1933, the Law Society had replaced the Public Solicitor in South Australia, and provided defendants with Solicitors who volunteered to take a case for no fee. In 1959, the Law Society had a budget of ¬£5,000 for administration and provided solicitors for more than 1,000 defendants who were required to pay their own out of pocket expenses. It was claimed the footprints found on the beach matched those of Stuart. A taxi driver testified that he had driven Stuart to the murder scene on the afternoon of the crime. Hairs belonging to the murderer had been found in the victim's hand and had been visually compared to Stuart's by police. The hairs from the crime scene were introduced as evidence, but no attempt was made by either the prosecution or defence to match them to Stuart's own hair (the hairs have since been destroyed so cannot now be tested). The case against Stuart relied almost entirely on his confession to the police. Stuart had asked to make a statement from the dock but he could not, as he was unable to read the statement prepared from his version of events. Permission for a court official to read the statement on his behalf was refused, so Stuart was only able to make a short statement in pidgin English: \\"I cannot read or write. Never been to school. I did not see the little girl. Police hit me, choke me. Make me said these words. They say I kill her.\\" This led the prosecutor to claim that Stuart's failure to give evidence was proof of guilt. Stuart had no choice but to refuse to testify. Under South Australian law, Stuart's prior criminal history could not be brought before the court as it was prejudicial. There were two exceptions; if a defendant under oath presents witnesses for his own good character or impugns the character of a prosecution witness, the prosecution is entitled to cross examine the defendant and present evidence to prove his bad character. As Stuart's defence was that police had beaten him then fabricated his confession, to state this under oath would allow the prosecution to present his prior criminal history, including the Cloncurry assault, to the jury.Remote Justice Keynote address by Justice Michael Kirby Pages 24‚Äì29 July 7, 2007 O'Sullivan suggested that police had forced Stuart into the confession, due to Stuart's poor command of the English language. However, the jury was unconvinced by the argument and Stuart was convicted. In line with the law, Judge Reed sentenced Stuart to death on 24 April 1959. Stuart's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Australia was rejected in May 1959. His appeal to the High Court of Australia in June 1959 also failed, although the High Court observed that certain features of this case have caused us some anxiety. The prison chaplain was unable to communicate with Stuart due to his limited command of English and called in Catholic priest Father Tom Dixon who spoke fluent Arrernte due to having worked on mission stations. Dixon was suspicious about the sophisticated upper class English used in the alleged confession, for example: \\"The show was situated at the Ceduna Oval.\\" Stuart's native language was Arrernte, he was uneducated, could not read and only spoke a slightly advanced pidgin Arrernte-English known as Northern Territory English. Anthropologist and linguist Ted Strehlow, who had been brought up in Arrernte society and had known Stuart since childhood, also had doubts. After visiting Stuart at Dixon's request on 18 May,Father Dixon commented \\"Thank goodness Stuart is not a Catholic\\". If he had been, Stuart denying the murder would have been regarded as confidential, and Dixon would not have been able to mention his doubts over Stuart's guilt with anyone. The church holds that the seal of the confessional would be inviolable even with Stuart's life at stake. was the first person to translate Stuart's alibi from his native tongue. Stuart claimed that he had taken Blackburn's taxi to the Thevenard hotel where he had paid an Aboriginal woman ¬£4 for sex and had remained there until arrested that night. Strehlow also tested Stuart's English.Strehlow found Stuart's English would appear to be boring and rambling to a native English speaker. Northern Territory people are often vague about dates and clock time, leading them to include unnecessary detail when describing an event. For example, in Stuart's alibi, he frequently interrupted his narrative with long word-for-word accounts of conversations he had had, despite them being totally irrelevant and of no interest. Northern Territory English also has idiomatic characteristics. \\"He\\" and \\"she\\" always follows the noun as in that man he told me instead of that man told me. Also \\"the\\" is not used before nouns and \\"them\\" is used instead of \\"those\\". The police confession in contrast was grammatically correct, laid out in logical order with only detail of use to a court. Strehlow also pointed out the use of words not used in pidgin such as \\"awoke\\", \\"unconscious\\" and \\"raped\\". He later swore an affidavit to the effect that the confession could not be genuine, enabling the appeal to the High Court. Ken Inglis, then a lecturer at Adelaide University, wrote in July 1959 of the doubts of Father Dixon and Ted Strehlow in the Nation, a fortnightly magazine. There was further reporting on the case in the Sydney Morning Herald and then Adelaide afternoon newspaper, The News, took up the issue. Had police claimed the typed confession summarised what Stuart had said there would have been little controversy; however, the six policemen who had interrogated Stuart testified under oath that the document was Stuart's \\"literal and exact confession, word for word.\\" One of the policemen who interrogated Stuart, chief inspector Paul Turner, stated on his deathbed in 2001 that police had \\"jollied\\" and joked the confession out of Stuart, and that once they had it, they bashed him. Fellow police officers denied Turner's claims, and insisted that the confession was verbatim, \\"Yes, we altered it a bit....but the substance is Stuart's.\\" Stuart's guilt is still debated. Stuart's execution date was set for Tuesday, 7 July 1959, and the Executive Council, chaired by Premier Thomas Playford, was due to sit on 6 July to reply to any petitions presented. The Advertiser had devoted all its correspondence pages to Stuart with 75% of writers in favour of commutation. Petitions with thousands of signatures supporting commutation had already been received, but that morning the first petition supporting the execution arrived by telegram. The petition, circulated in Ceduna, Thevenard and the surrounding districts had 334 signatures. The Executive Council sat at 12:30 pm and considered the petitions for 20 minutes before issuing a statement: \\"The prisoner is left for execution in the due course of the law. No recommendation is made for pardon or reprieve.\\" Stuart was told of the decision and given a cigarette. He was then informed that the execution would take place at 8 am the following morning. Father Dixon was requested to keep Stuart calm and he visited him that night. Asked if he was afraid, Stuart replied he would not be if Dixon stayed through the night, and Dixon agreed to do so. Not long after, Stuart was informed that during the afternoon, O'Sullivan had lodged an appeal to the Privy Council in London and Justice Reed had issued a 14-day stay; this appeal also failed, however. Royal Commission By the time the Privy Council had rejected Stuart's appeal, Father Dixon had questioned the funfair workers, none of whom had appeared at the trial, and had returned with statements from Mr and Mrs Gieseman and one of the workers, Betty Hopes. Gieseman claimed that Stuart had left the funfair at 9:30 am, but had returned for lunch at 1:45 pm. He had then worked on the darts stall until 4 pm when he had left with Moir. Moir had then returned drunk at 11 pm, while Stuart had not returned until the following morning. Gieseman's wife confirmed this account. Hopes claimed she had worked with Stuart on the stall from 2 pm to 4 pm, and had given him 2 shillings (20c) to buy some chocolate for her when he told her he was going to the shop. News of the declarations resulted in a petition calling for the case to be re-opened. This in turn led to a petition demanding that the death sentence be carried out. The controversy forced Premier Thomas Playford IV to call a Royal Commission. In August 1959 a Royal Commission, the Royal Commission in Regard to Rupert Max Stuart, was convened by the South Australian government. The Commission was appointed to enquire into matters raised in statutory declarations regarding Stuart's actions and intentions, his movements on 20 December 1958, and why the information in the declarations had not been raised in the Supreme Court or another authority before the declarations were made, and the circumstances in which the declarations were obtained and made. Before the commission, Stuart presented an alibi that his defence had never raised at the trial, that he had been working at the funfair when the crime was committed. The detective who had questioned Alan Moir in Whyalla had given three different versions of what Moir had said in his statement. John Wentworth (Jack) Shand QC, counsel for Stuart, asked the detective which of the three versions was correct at which Justice Napier stated, He is not obliged to explain anything Mr Shand. Shand asked if he should stop the examination to which Napier replied, as far as I am concerned, I have heard enough of this. Shand withdrew from the case the next day claiming that the Commission was unable properly to consider the problems before it. Adelaide's daily newspaper, The News, covered the walkout with front-page headlines Shand Blasts Napier and These Commissioners Cannot Do The Job. Of the 11 witnesses before The Commission, only three, including the taxi driver, had testified in the original trial. The three funfair workers claimed Stuart had been at the darts stand from 2 pm to 4 pm. Clement Chester claimed he had been at the funfair from 2 pm to 4 pm and had not seen Stuart. Ray Wells claimed he had been in Spry's store in Ceduna when he had overheard Stuart on the telephone ordering a taxi. Spry, the store owner, remembered Stuart waiting in the store for the taxi. Colin Ware claimed he had seen Stuart and Moir get into a taxi around 2 pm which had driven off in the direction of Thevenard. Taxi driver Bill Blackburn claimed he had picked up Stuart and Moir at 2 pm, and two Aboriginal girls, aged 15 and 16, claimed they had seen Stuart drinking on the verandah of the Thevenard Hotel at 2:30 pm. The Commissioners declared that the suggestion that police had intimidated Stuart into signing the confession was \\"quite unacceptable\\", and on 3 December 1959, the Commission concluded that Stuart's conviction was justified. Campaigns against death sentence On 22 June 1959, Father Dixon contacted Dr. Charles Duguid, who ran the Aborigines' Advancement League, to discuss Stuart's situation. On 27 June, a meeting of the League, university teachers, clergymen and representative of the Howard League for Penal Reform was held in Duguid's Magill home, where Dixon and Strehlow spoke to the meeting. It was decided to mount a campaign to keep Stuart alive, and the distribution of petitions for Commutation of sentence was arranged. The meeting was mentioned in a small report in The News, an afternoon newspaper, but didn't mention the participants. On 30 June, the morning newspaper, The Advertiser, printed a letter expressing concern over Stuart's conviction. On 1 June, The News printed a small story with the headline, Petitioners Run a Race with Death. By now supporters and opponents of the death penalty were debating in the two newspapers' Letter to the editor sections, but there was little concern expressed over Stuart himself. When Dr. H. V. Evatt, federal leader of the opposition, intervened, the news was featured on the front page of the 3 July edition of The News. The campaign so far had been for commutation, but Evatt argued for a retrial. Printed alongside Evatt's statement on the front page was one by the South Australian Police Association intended, it said, to inform the public \\"of the real facts\\". This statement claimed that Stuart was not illiterate and spoke \\"impeccable English\\". It also claimed that Stuart was legally classified as a white man and cited a record of offences that are not offences when committed by an Aboriginal person. It also recounted a trial in Darwin where Stuart had defended himself, personally cross-examined witnesses in English, and given evidence himself. O'Sullivan, Stuart's solicitor, wrote a reply refuting the Police Association claims; this was published the next day, citing the fact that Stuart's police record included seven convictions for \\"Being an Aborigine, did drink liquor\\", and pointing out that the President of the Police Association was Detective Sgt. Paul Turner, the most senior of the six policemen who had obtained Stuart's contested confession. The Law Society expressed outrage and stated that the Police Association statement bordered on contempt of court and would prejudice any jury hearing a future appeal. The Society strongly suggested the government fund a further appeal to the United Kingdom Privy Council. O'Sullivan was denied access to records of Stuart's trials to check the English that Turner claimed Stuart had used, and the government also refused to prevent Turner from commenting publicly on the case. As a result, the Sunday Mail, then a joint enterprise of The News and The Advertiser, printed prominently on its front page O'Sullivan's \\"suspicion\\" that the government was determined to hang Stuart and was supporting the Police Association in order to do so. The Police Association statement, and later comments from Turner including that Stuart had conducted English classes for prisoners while in Alice Springs Gaol, were widely condemned and are credited with prompting the appeal to the Privy Council, putting the Stuart case in the newspaper headlines, and keeping it there. Two of the Commissioners appointed by Premier Playford, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had been involved in the case, Napier as presiding judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge, leading to considerable worldwide controversy, with claims of bias from sources such as the President of the Indian Bar Council, the Leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party, Jo Grimond, and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Labor Party MP Don Dunstan asked questions in Parliament and played a major role in Premier Playford's decision to commute Stuart's sentence to life imprisonment. Playford's daughter, Dr Margaret Fereday, recalled arguing with him on the issue, calling him a murderer. Playford gave no reason for his decision, and the case was one of the principal events leading to the fall of the Playford government in 1965. The News, edited by Rohan RivettRohan Rivett is the grandson of Australia's second Prime Minister Alfred Deakin. and owned by Rupert Murdoch, campaigned heavily against Stuart's death sentence. Because of the campaign through The News, Rivett, as editor, and The News itself, were charged in 1960 with seditious and malicious libel, with Premier Playford describing the coverage as the gravest libel ever made against any judge in this State. Dr John Bray, later Chief Justice and Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, represented Rivett. The jury determined that the defendants had not committed an offence, and the remaining charges were withdrawn. A few weeks later, Murdoch dismissed Rivett. Rivett had been Editor-in-Chief of The News since 1951. It has been suggested that in Black and White, a 2002 film of the case, the role of Murdoch was magnified, and the part of his editor, Rivett, was minimised. However, it was noted in the Royal Commission that Murdoch wrote editorials, headlines and posters for the campaign. Murdoch himself believed Stuart guilty: \\"There's no doubt that Stuart didn't get a totally fair trial. Although it's probable that he was guilty, I thought this at the time. In those days ‚Äì although less so now ‚Äì I was very much against the death penalty.\\" Bruce Page, Murdoch's biographer, said the case was pivotal in his career. \\"It was the very brief period of Rupert's radicalism, which was a very good thing for Stuart, as it got him out of the hangman's noose. Murdoch galloped into action, but it was a bad fight for him. The truth is it scared him off from ever taking on governments again. He reverted to his father's pattern of toeing the line.\\"Ruthless Rupe is recast as an angel of mercy The Guardian 4 January 2004 Stuart says of Murdoch that \\"He done a good one in my case\\" and also, \\"He wanted the truth, you know. I could see him out in the court. I was with the policemen; my lawyer told me it was him.\\" Imprisonment Stuart was released on parole in 1973. He was then in and out of jail for breaking provisions of his parole that banned consumption of alcohol until 1984, when he was paroled from Adelaide's Yatala Labour Prison for the sixth and final time. During his time at Yatala Prison, Stuart learned proper English, became literate, began painting in watercolours and acquired other work skills. In between being returned to prison a number of times for breaches of his parole between 1974 and 1984, he married and settled at Santa Teresa, a Catholic mission south-east of Alice Springs. Significance of the case Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC said of the case: > It was a dramatic and very important case because it alerted Australia to > the difficulties that Aborigines, who then weren't even counted in the > census, encountered in our courts. It alerted us to the appalling feature of > capital punishment of the death sentence that applied to people who may well > be innocent. Indigenous politics In 1985, Patrick Dodson, then director of the Central Land Council, appointed Stuart to a part-time job. This appointment transformed Stuart, giving him respect and giving rise to his successful rehabilitation. Stuart shared his knowledge of Aboriginal law and tradition, which he had gained from his grandfather as a youth, and became an Arrernte elder. Stuart subsequently became an active figure in Central Australian Aboriginal affairs, in particular with the Lhere Artepe native title organisation. Stuart was chairman of the Central Land Council (CLC) from 1998 to 2001. In 2000, as chairman of the CLC, Stuart welcomed the Queen to Alice Springs and made a presentation to her. in September 2001, Stuart was cultural director of the Yeperenye Federation Festival. In 2004, Stuart was the Public Officer for the CANCA Aboriginal Corporation, a role derived from his employment with the Central Land Council. Publications on the case Books on the case were written by Ken Inglis, one of the first to publicise the doubts about the case; Sir Roderic Chamberlain, the Crown Prosecutor; and Father Tom Dixon, the priest who raised concerns about Stuart's confession.  Docudrama The first chapter of the 1993 four part Blood Brothers documentary series, Broken English ‚Äì The Conviction of Max Stuart was directed by Ned Lander. It is a docudrama which contains interviews with key figures in the Stuart case that alternates with dramatised recreations. Lawrence Turner plays Max Stuart with Hugo Weaving, Noah Taylor and Tony Barry co-starring. Originally intended to be a documentary on the case based around Father Tom Dixon, Dixon died during production and the film was restructured as a docudrama.Blood Brothers ‚Äì Broken English (Synopsis) National Film and Sound Archive of Australia Historian Ken Inglis, who participated in the Stuart case as a journalist and wrote an account of the trial and appeals, praised the documentary as accurate, but noted that \\"anything which could have suggested that Stuart was guilty... was left out of the film.\\" The weight of evidence, he said, tilted toward guilt rather than innocence. Film The 2002 feature film Black and White, directed by Craig Lahiff, was made about his case, and featured David Ngoombujarra as Max Stuart; Robert Carlyle as Stuart's lawyer David O'Sullivan; Charles Dance as the Crown Prosecutor Roderic Chamberlain; Kerry Fox as O'Sullivan's business partner Helen Devaney; Colin Friels as Father Tom Dixon; Bille Brown as South Australian Premier Sir Thomas Playford; Ben Mendelsohn as newspaper publisher Rupert Murdoch; and John Gregg as Rohan Rivett. The film won an Australian Film Institute award in 2003 for David Ngoombujarra as Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The final scene of this film was the last scene from the 1993 docudrama Blood Brothers ‚Äì Broken English, directed by Ned Lander. The makers of the movie were divided on whether Stuart had killed Mary Hattam. The Supreme Court of South Australia provided assistance to the producers of the film with the Court's Historical Collection Library producing an exhibition on the case that coincided with the Adelaide screening of the film.Supreme Court Justices Annual Report 2002 The film's producer, Helen Leake has reported that Stuart's response to seeing the film was, \\"It ain't half bad, but it's a long time to wait between smokes.\\" Documentary A 2006 documentary Sunset to Sunrise (ingwartentyele ‚Äì arrerlkeme) featured Max Stuart at his Lila Creek (Arrernte: Ananta) campsite (his ancestral home). Filmed from sunset to sunrise, Arrernte Mat-utjarra and Mu-tujulu elder Stuart discusses the significance of Indigenous culture and the Dreaming. By explaining Indigenous religion in relation to the land, he shares his beliefs on the importance of passing on Indigenous culture to keep it alive and the importance of Indigenous peoples being able to speak their tribal language as well as English.

It is located on the Welland Canal and Highway 20, both important transportation routes through the Niagara Peninsula. The two cross at a vertical-lift bridge, numbered as Bridge 11 by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Authority, but often known simply as the Allanburg Bridge. The collision of the ship Windoc with the bridge made national news in 2001. Inception of the Welland Canal The original sod-turning ceremony for the construction of the First Welland Canal took place in the area on November 30, 1824. Today, a cairn at the west approach to the lift bridge commemorates the event. Windoc incident At approximately 20:54 on August 11, 2001, the bulk carrier vessel Windoc struck the descending Allanburg lift bridge. The ship's wheelhouse and funnel were ripped off in the collision, starting a fire on board. Uncontrollable, the vessel drifted downstream and ran aground from the bridge. Fire fighting units from throughout Niagara Region were involved in the efforts to put out the fire, parking the fire trucks on the canal's banks. There was no loss of life. The master and third officer were able to escape the wheelhouse before its destruction. The wheelsman remained in the wheelhouse and survived the collision by lying on the deck until the bridge span passed overhead. The canal reopened to shipping two days later, but the bridge remained locked in a raised position while engineers studied and repaired the structure. Road traffic through central Niagara was left in considerable chaos, as the number of canal crossings is limited. Detours were set up to travel through the Thorold Tunnel north of Allanburg. Eventually, the damage to the bridge was found to be minor and repaired. Windoc has sat in the port of Montreal ever since, inoperable and its bilges flooded. Later, an investigation found that the impaired bridge operator lowered the bridge before the ship had cleared the span.

It was produced by Universal Pictures. Jack Pierce's werewolf make-up was simpler than his version six years later for Lon Chaney, Jr. in The Wolf Man. Werewolf of London was the first Hollywood mainstream film to feature a werewolf. The film's supporting cast features Warner Oland, Valerie Hobson, Lester Matthews, and Spring Byington. Plot Wilfred Glendon (Henry Hull) is a wealthy and world- renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland), who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa (Valerie Hobson) is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames (Lester Matthews), allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time. Unfortunately Dr. Yogami, who is revealed to be a werewolf, sneaks into the lab ahead of his rival and steals the only two blossoms. As the third has not bloomed, Glendon is out of luck. Driven by an instinctive desire to hunt and kill, he dons his hat and coat and ventures out into the dark city, killing an innocent girl. Burdened by remorse, Glendon begins neglecting Lisa (more so than usual), and makes numerous futile attempts to lock himself up far away from home, including renting a room at an inn. However, whenever he transforms into the werewolf he escapes and kills again. After a time, the third blossom of the mariphasa finally blooms, but much to Glendon's horror, it is stolen by Yogami, sneaking into the lab while Glendon's back is turned. Catching Yogami in the act, Glendon finally realizes that Yogami was the werewolf that attacked him in Tibet. After turning into the werewolf yet again and slaying Yogami, Glendon goes to the house in search of Lisa, for the werewolf instinctively seeks to destroy that which it loves the most. After attacking Paul on the front lawn of Glendon Manor, but not killing him, Glendon breaks into the house and corners Lisa on the staircase and is about to move in for the kill when Paul's uncle, Col. Sir Thomas Forsythe (Lawrence Grant) of Scotland Yard, arriving with several police officers in tow, shoots Glendon once. As he lies dying at the bottom of the stairs, Glendon, still in werewolf form, speaks: first to thank Col. Forsythe for the merciful bullet, then saying goodbye to Lisa, apologizing that he could not have made her happier. Glendon then dies, reverting to his human form in death.

M. Kerrigan as Hawkins * Charlotte Granville as Lady Forsythe * Ethel Griffies as Mrs. Whack * Zeffie Tilbury as Mrs. Moncaster * Jeanne Bartlett as Daisy Production=Sound and make-up Jack Pierce's original werewolf design for Henry Hull was identical to the one used later for Lon Chaney, Jr. in The Wolf Man, but it was rejected in favor of a minimalist approach that was less obscuring to facial expressions. Although it has often been reported that this was because Hull was unwilling to spend hours having makeup applied, or because he didn't want his face obscured because of vanity, the real reason, according to Hull's great-nephew Cortlandt Hull, who heard it from Hull himself, is that Hull‚Äîwho was an accomplished makeup artist in his own right‚Äîargued that, according to the script, the werewolf had to be recognizable to the other characters as Dr. Glendon. This would not have been possible under the more extreme makeup. Pierce resisted the change, so Hull went over Pierce's head to the studio head, Carl Laemmle, who approved, much to Pierce's annoyance. The werewolf's howl was an audio blend of Hull and a recording of an actual timber wolf, an approach which was never duplicated in any subsequent werewolf film. Also, at the beginning of the film, the supposed \\"Tibetan\\" spoken by villagers in the movie is actually Cantonese; Henry Hull is otherwise just muttering gibberish in his responses to them. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on , with a weighted average rating of 6.4/10. Frank S. Nugent, reviewing in The New York Times what was the last film to appear in the Rialto Theatre before the theatre was torn down and rebuilt in 1935, called the film a \\"charming bit of lycanthropy\\"; according to Nugent, the film was > Designed solely to amaze and horrify, the film goes about its task with > commendable thoroughness, sparing no grisly detail and springing from scene > to scene with even greater ease than that oft attributed to the daring young > aerialist. Granting that the central idea has been used before, the picture > still rates the attention of action-and-horror enthusiasts. It is a fitting > valedictory for the old Rialto, which has become melodrama's citadel among > Times Square's picture houses. Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars, calling the film \\"dated but still effective\\", complimenting Oland's performance as Dr. Yogami. The movie was considered at the time as too similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) with Fredric March, which had been released only a few years before, and was a box office disappointment. Legacy The film inspired at least five pop culture entries: Warren Zevon's 1978 hit song \\"Werewolves of London\\"; Paul Roland's 1980 album and single \\"The Werewolf of London\\"; the 1981 film An American Werewolf in London, the 1997 sequel An American Werewolf in Paris and the 1987 video game Werewolves of London. The film was re-released to theaters in 1951 by Realart Pictures. The story has been novelized twice. The first time was in 1977, a paperback novel written under the pseudonym \\"Carl Dreadstone\\" (now confirmed as Walter Harris) Ian Covell \\"Ian Covell on ‚ÄòCarl Dreadstone‚Äô\\", Souvenirs Of Terror fiendish film & TV show tie-ins, October 3, 2007, accessed 11 July 2011. as part of a short-lived series of books based on the classic Universal horror films. The novel is told from the point of view of Wilfred Glendon (whose first name is now inexplicably spelled \\"Wilfrid\\") and thus follows an almost entirely different story structure than the film. In particular it has a different ending. Rather than turning into a werewolf, killing Yogami, and then being shot by Sir Thomas, Glendon decides to cooperate with Yogami and they both attempt to control their transformations through hypnotism. However the plan fails, the hypnotist is killed, and Glendon and Yogami both transform and fight to the death. Glendon wins, killing Yogami, and returns to human form afterwards. The novel then ends with Glendon, alive, contemplating using the hypnotist's gun to commit suicide rather than go on living as a werewolf. The second time was in 1985, as part of Crestwood House's hardcover Movie Monsters series, again based on the old Universal films. This time, the author was Carl Green, and was considerably shorter, followed the plot of the film more closely, and was illustrated extensively with still photos from the movie. Jack Pierce's minimalist werewolf design has been referenced and duplicated in other werewolf-themed works, such as 1994's Wolf, with Jack Nicholson as well as the Showtime series Penny Dreadful.

The art is offered for sale in its original form, without its final shading, usually in two rows (which were combined into one on the web version), 7.75\\"x10.75\\" on vellum Bristol paper sized 9\\" x 12\\". Once purchased, the name of the buyer replaced the \\"Buy\\" link, accompanied by the date and time of purchase. Little Dee's final strip appeared on Tuesday April 6, 2010. To mark the occasion Baldwin offered a limited edition print of the characters for sale, incorporating a customized sketch and signature for each customer. The edition quickly sold out. In late May 2010 Baldwin announced that the strip would begin a complete re-run on its original site, \\"larger and with more annotations\\", commencing June 7, 2010, the strip's sixth anniversary. Characters and general plot The strip starts with Dee lost in the woods. Lonely, she hugs the first thing she can find, a bear called Ted. Ted can't find it in his heart to eat such a cute girl, so he adopts her, much to the chagrin of his friend Vachel, a vulture. Blake, a domesticated dog who has become feral, convinces the others that they should look for Dee's parents, which they do periodically. The four live together in a cave inexplicably equipped with furniture, running water, and electricity. Dee's real name is not known; it is the name Ted has given her. Some of their time is spent searching for Dee's parents; much of the rest is spent in the cave or on other adventures. *Dee is an archetypal child: young, cute, innocent, and fearless. She represents all that is simple and cheerfully adventurous. She does not speak, which adds to her childlikeness and seeming na√Øvete, yet she often is the boldest of all the characters. *Ted is sensible, a parent, a mediator. Dee is most often seen hugging him. He is fiercely protective of her. The only thing that rattles Ted is Dee's misadventures. Ted is very fond of chocolate. *Blake is the link for the other animals to the human world as he is domesticated, yet now lives in the woods. He is good-natured and somewhat naive and gullible ‚Äî not the brightest of the characters. He considers the group his \\"pack\\" and Ted the \\"alpha.\\" *Vachel is the cynic and the curmudgeon of the group. He is the most likely to make snide remarks or see the dark side of things. Initially the least affectionate toward Dee, he was eventually won over. Atypically, one of his hobbies is knitting. He occasionally recounts events in his earlier life, such as when he lived with several other animals in a library and when he was part of a monastery of roller-skating monks. *Kendra is a young rabbit who approaches most subjects with an intense enthusiasm that the main characters find less than endearing. She and Dee are sometimes playmates. *Pud√∫ is a pud√∫, who lives in Chile and is constantly visiting Dee and her friends in the United States. Pud√∫ has an easygoing, na√Øve personality. He is also highly energetic (as if hyped up by caffeine), and is quite a pushover. Series concerning Pud√∫'s visits usually result in him offering to go home and fetch something to help with the current situation, only to return three to six months later and find that the object he has fetched now has nothing to do with what's currently happening. *The Alligator is an alligator who has a very strong crush on Blake and seems totally unaware that Blake does not love him in return. Ted often kicks him out of the cave when he visits Blake (due to his fear that he will eat one of his friends), so he has taken to visiting in secret, despite the fact that Blake is agitated by this. *Alida is an elephant who has a crush on Vachel. In contrast to Blake's relationship with the Alligator, Vachel somewhat returns Alida's affection. *A couple of fish appear from time to time, usually chattering away while one of the main characters is about to drown. They eventually end up saving whoever is in trouble at the last possible second, by such methods as \\"poking him in the bum with a pin\\". *The Terranauts are a pair of fish (possibly the same ones) who spend some time exploring dry land and its inhabitants. They wear diving suits full of water, walk on their tail flukes and use their front fins like arms. The suits are supplied with fresh water by hoses from somewhere underwater.

In the early 19th century, this was the main east/west road in Illinois.  History  Goshen Road started as a natural, or pioneer, trace: a route that was used by Native Americans and migrating animals. The road was not a definite, marked out path. It was, rather, a collection of vague, parallel paths that crossed, shifting with the season and over the years. Eventually the demand for salt solidified the road's importance. \\"The builders of Goshen Road looked east, striving toward a place where they could obtain their necessity - salt,\\" wrote historian Barbara Burr Hubbs.Egyptian Key, 1949 (a bi-monthly publication from 1943-1950). Salt was one of the dearest commodities that early settlers had and one of the most difficult to obtain. Settlers at Goshen at one time bought it eagerly for $9 a barrel. Hubbs explains further: :\\"In the east beyond the Ohio, men looked west, striving toward new homes and better living . . . The Goshen Road funneled new residents into Illinois Territory at such a rate, its citizens became ambitious to have a state. They came by horse-drawn wagons, by two- wheeled ox-carts; they rode horses and donkeys and 'shank's mares;' they pushed wheelbarrows and carried their wealth on their backs. But they came and many stayed. Not all went the length of the road, but in 1818 when a census was taken to determine whether the Illinois population was sufficient for statehood, settlers lined the old route. It was a belt settlement from the Ohio at Shawneetown to the Mississippi at Alton . . . All across the state the generation whose fathers had traveled the Goshen Road blessed the men of Goshen who needed salt and built a road.\\" John Reynolds, later Governor of Illinois, adds, \\"In the fall of 1808 a wagon road was laid off from Goshen settlement to the Ohio River salt works which in olden times was called The Goshen Road.\\"Reynolds, John. The Pioneer History of Illinois. 2nd ed. (Chicago: Fergus Printing Company, 1887). The southern stretch of the road was permanently laid out in an interesting way to find a direct route without surveying. They led a mare a day's journey away from her foal - then turned her loose. Rough blazes were cut on trees as the mare took the instinctive straightest course back to her foal.Claybourn, Verner M., and Harriette Pinnell Threlkeld. The Claybourn Family (A-1 Business Service, 1959).  Route  Beginning around 1800, the Illinois Territory was surveyed pursuant to the Land Ordinance of 1785. Because this survey was aimed at establishing the Township and Section boundaries, the surveyors were not paid for mapping roads. However, many did show the locations of roads. Because the Goshen Road was often the only noteworthy feature at the time of the original survey, the road was noted in many of these surveys. Because these surveys marked only the Section boundaries, we often have an accurate location of the road only at one-mile (1.6 km) intervals. Goshen Road generally followed the Saline River watershed in a northwesterly direction until it met the Big Muddy River/Saline River divide, which was also the Mississippi River/Ohio River divide. It then followed that divide in a northwesterly direction, avoiding a crossing of the swamps around the Big Muddy River. The road finally crossed the Big Muddy watershed in northern Jefferson County. The road then crossed the Kaskaskia Bottoms, which could not be avoided, on a fairly direct line toward the Goshen Settlement, in the Glen Carbon area. Gallatin and Saline Counties The old maps do not provide a location for the Goshen Road in Gallatin and Saline Counties. The road from Old Shawneetown to the salt works at Equality is shown, skirting the Shawnee Hills to the south of modern Illinois Route 13. Although the road probably ran from Equality toward Eldorado, there is no trace on the old maps. Hamilton County From the south, the original survey of Illinois first shows the Goshen Road cutting across the southwestern corner of McLeansboro Township, following the divide between two minor watersheds of the Saline River. No trace of the road remains in this area. From there, the road is shown entering Knight's Prairie. Goshen Road ran northwesterly across Knight's Prairie Township in western Hamilton County. The route is marked by a series of modern roads that do not follow the surveyed section lines. The road ran past the modern Ten Mile Creek State Fish and Wildlife Area, appropriately named the \\"Goshen Trail Unit\\". One of the earliest settlers in Hamilton County was William Hardisty, who recorded a land claim in Knight's Prairie, adjacent to the road, in 1819. Hardisty was living in Washington County, Kentucky as late as 1815, but held public office in Hamilton County by 1820. In western Hamilton County, Goshen Road roughly followed the divide between the Big Muddy River and Wabash River. *Knight's Prairie Township Topographic Map *Mt. Nebo Cemetery Topographic Map Jefferson County The earliest settler in Jefferson County was Andrew Moore, who located next to the road in 1810, near the southeast corner of the County. The Goshen Road entered the county near the southeast corner, from Hamilton County. The road exits that County as a beautifully preserved pioneer road, continuing several miles into Jefferson County as a more modern road that does not follow the Section boundaries. The original Goshen Road turned north toward modern Opdyke, following the Big Muddy/Wabash Divide. Although the road that continues northwest toward Mt. Vernon is named \\"Goshen Road\\", it is the \\"Old State Highway\\" that was built some decades later. The original road circled around what was to become Mt. Vernon, in order to avoid the impassable swamps to the south and west of the City. The location of the Goshen Road has been fairly well mapped across Jefferson County by Hank Lee. Signs displaying an ornate \\"G\\" have been placed along modern roads close to where the old road passed. There is some confusion in Jefferson County because the County has assigned the \\"Goshen Road\\" name to roads that were built at later dates. As shown on the original survey of Illinois, the original Goshen Road ran straight north through the center of what eventually became the village of Opdyke, which came into existence when the east/west railroad was built through town, in the 1880s. The main north/south road today is the Section road to the west of town. All that is left of the Goshen Road is a three-block street that crosses the railroad tracks, and then goes nowhere. From Opdyke the road ran northward toward its first difficult creek crossing: Two Mile Creek. The road was poorly mapped in this area in the original survey, and no trace seems to remain. Across the Creek, the road turned eastward somewhere near Marlow. The stretch of road running northwest near Marlow is a segment of the old Road, as mapped on the original survey. There are traces of an old road that runs through the cemetery at Hopewell Church, near Miller Lake. The local legend identifies this as the Goshen Road. The original survey maps, however, show the road running in an east/west direction, along the line of the modern road about north of the cemetery. From Hopewell Church, the road ran northwest toward modern Miller Lake. It crossed Casey Creek to the south of the dam. Deep wagon ruts are visible where the road climbed the bluff to the west of Casey Creek. A man-made earthen mound, long, wide and high, protrudes from the bluff just to the north of the crossing point. This may have been an ancient defensive mound built to control this crossing point. From the Casey Creek crossing, the road ran northwest to modern Dix. Although the original survey of Illinois mapped the road in this area, few traces remain. Northwest of Dix, the road generally followed the line of what became the Southern Railway. A line of old roads parallels the tracks, a little to the north. It is not clear if any one of these is the old road, or if these roads were built after the railroad obliterated the old road when the railroad was built around 1900. Goshen Road exited Jefferson County near Walnut Hill. *TopoQuest, SE Corner Jefferson County *TopoQuest, Sugar Creek, Moores Prairie *TopoQuest, Opdyke, Illinois *TopoQuest, Marlow, Illinois *TopoQuest, Hopewell Church *TopoQuest, Casey Creek Crossing *TopoQuest, Northwest of Dix Marion County The Goshen Road entered Marion County just to the south of Walnut Hill. It crossed the Fort Kaskaskia/Fort Vincennes Road at Walnut Hill. The modern road that runs northwest out of Walnut Hill toward Centralia appears to be a segment of the Goshen Road, corresponding almost exactly with the road shown on the original township surveys. This road meets U.S. Route 51 just south of Centralia. *TopoQuest, Walnut Hill, Illinois *TopoQuest, South of Centralia Madison County The Goshen Settlement was located in what became Madison County. A modern road to the south of Edwardsville is called the \\"Goshen Road\\", and is said to be a segment of the old road. This connects Illinois Route 143 with Route 159. This road is near the upper reaches of Judy's Creek. From there, the road probably followed the creek valley down to the Goshen Settlement, which was located at the base of the bluff, where Judy's Creek enters the American Bottom on its way to the Mississippi River. *TopoQuest, Edwardsville to Goshen Settlement  References External links *History of Glen Carbon, Illinois *Maps from original Survey of Illinois Category:Pre-statehood history of Illinois Category:Historic trails and roads in Illinois ","title":"Goshen Road"},{"id":"3566561","text":"The Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation (MPIC), known as Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI), is a non-profit Crown corporation based in Manitoba that has provided basic public auto insurance since 1971.

Chaney did collaborative scenes with real-life armless double Paul Desmuke (sometimes credited as Peter Dismuki), whose legs and feet were used to manipulate objects such as knives and cigarettes in frame with Chaney's upper body and face. Plot Alonzo the Armless is a circus freak who uses his feet to toss knives and fire a rifle at his partner, Nanon. However, he is an impostor and fugitive. He has arms, but keeps them tightly bound to his torso, a secret known only to his friend Cojo, a little person. Alonzo's left hand has a double thumb, which would identify him as the perpetrator of various crimes. Alonzo is secretly in love with Nanon. Malabar, the circus strongman, is devoted to her as well, but she has a strong fear of men's arms and cannot stand being pawed by them, so she shuns him. She only feels comfortable around the armless Alonzo. When she embraces and kisses him, he is given hope, but Cojo warns him that he cannot let it happen again. If she holds him, she might feel his arms. When Antonio Zanzi, the circus's owner and Nanon's father, discovers Alonzo's secret, Alonzo kills him with his bare hands. Nanon witnesses this through a window. A flash of lightning reveals that her father's killer has a double thumb on his left hand, but she does not see his face. Since Alonzo is believed to be armless, he is not a suspect. When the circus leaves town, Alonzo has Nanon remain behind with him. He takes extreme measures to try to have the woman he loves. He blackmails a surgeon into amputating his arms. While he is away, however, Malabar's steadfast love finally enables Nanon to overcome her phobia, and she agrees to marry him. When Alonzo (now truly armless) returns to Nanon, she excitedly tells him the news. Alonzo is shocked and horrified, first laughing, then crying, confusing the couple. He then learns that Malabar and Nanon have been practicing a new act, where the strongman's arms are seemingly pulled in opposite directions by two horses (who are actually on hidden treadmills). During the first performance, Alonzo stops one treadmill in an attempt to maim or kill his rival. When Nanon starts to intervene, Alonzo threatens her with a knife. However, she rushes to calm down one of the horses. Alonzo tries to save her from injury by pushing her out of the way. The horse knocks Alonzo down and fatally stomps on him. In the original film script and some discarded filmed sequences, Alonzo murders both the doctor and Cojo, to eliminate them as witnesses before he returns to claim Nanon.

Administrative parts The village of Vƒõ≈ô≈àovice (Wierzniowice) is an administrative part of Doln√≠ Lutynƒõ. History The village of Lutynƒõ was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Luthina LXXI) mansi. It meant that the village was supposed to pay tithe from 71 greater lans. The village could have been founded by Benedictine monks from an Orlov√° abbeyI. Panic, 2010, p. 430 and also it could a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The large village was later in the 14th century subdivided into two sister settlements. Doln√≠ Lutynƒõ was then known for centuries as German (Theutonicum), and the other as Polish (Polonicum), now Lutynƒõ district of Orlov√°. For example, in 1450 they were together mentioned as Lutynie utrumque Theutonicum et Polonicum. German Lutynie became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deaconry as Lutina. Since 1700 it was a property of Taafe counts who built there a baroque ch√¢teau as their summer residence. Object currently has no architectonical value and serves as an apartment building. At the end of the 19th century coal boom affected Cieszyn Silesia and industrialization rapidly grew. This had also impact on the village, demographically and economically. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. The village was host to an unexploded bomb from World War II, which remained in the village until being discovered in 2014. Resultantly, 400 residents were evacuated from their homes. Notable landmarks include Catholic baroque John the Baptist church from 1746, old apothecary shop built around 1900 and the Polish school.

() (December 31, 1810 ‚Äì May 12, 1878) was a Roman Catholic cleric who became the first Bishop of Los Angeles, California. Early life Amat was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain on December 31, 1810. He entered the Congregation of the Mission, commonly called the Vincentian Fathers, in 1832 and was ordained a priest of the Congregation on December 23, 1837, in Paris, France, by Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu√©len, the Archbishop of Paris. He was then sent to the United States as a missionary in Louisiana. He later served as a master of novices for his congregation in Missouri and Pennsylvania. Bishop On 28 July 1853, while serving as the Rector of St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia, he was appointed the Bishop of Monterey in California. The diocese's previous bishop, Joseph Sadoc Alemany, O.P., had been promoted to archbishop of the newly created Archdiocese of San Francisco. Father Amat.jpgFather Amat's signature, 1869 Amat was consecrated as a bishop in Rome on March 12, 1854 by Cardinal Fransoni, the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. Recognizing the growth of Los Angeles and the decline of Monterey, he petitioned the Holy See to move the see to Los Angeles and to be known as Bishop of Los Angeles. Amat arrived in the pueblo of Los Angeles in 1855. On July 7, 1859, the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles. The Co-Cathedral of Saint Vibiana was founded in Los Angeles and consecrated during the episcopacy of Amat, and he himself brought back from Rome the relics of its patron saint, which were interred in a sarcophagus above the cathedral's main altar. Father Amat traveled to Rome in 1869 to attend the First Vatican Council called upon by Pope Pius IX. On June 28, 1870, Father Amat was an orator during the official mass of the 78th Congregation celebrated in the Vatican. The Council was interrupted when King Victor Emmanuel II attacked Rome and deposed Pope Pius IX. Pius IX suspended the Council indefinitely on October 20, 1870. Dispute over the Californian missions Amat came into conflict with Friar Jos√© Gonz√°lez Rubio, O.F.M., of the Mission Santa Barbara, over the control of the mission after President Abraham Lincoln returned the California missions to the Catholic Church. The Franciscans claimed, on the basis of both Church law and historical grounds, that the missions were rightfully under their direct jurisdiction and not that of the diocese, and that, in the case of Mission Santa Barbara, they should hold the deed. Institutions founded Amat founded some of the first schools in Los Angeles and asked his fellow Vincentians to open St. Vincent's College (now known as Loyola Marymount University). It was the first institution of higher learning in Southern California. He welcomed the Franciscan Brothers of Ireland into his diocese to work in the parochial schools, as well as the Daughters of Charity and the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Amat formally consecrated Calvary Cemetery on North Broadway (formerly Buena Vista Street) at Bishops Road in 1866. The area had been set aside in 1844.

He was an influential figure in the manufacture and retail of British high fidelity audio equipment in the 1970s and 1980s. He was appointed MBE by HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1995. Biography=Family and education Julian Vereker was born in Oxford, England. He was the great- great grandson of the 3rd Viscount Gort. His great-grandfather had been Consul at Cherbourg and his grandfather a naval commander; his father Charles became Professor of Political Theory at Durham University. Vereker therefore grew up in a lively academic family, which did not prevent him from becoming a rebellious adolescent in the 1960s. Though requiring four attempts to pass O Level mathematics, he developed a passion for engineering, left Bryanston School at 16. He attended technical college in Liverpool, followed by the College of Aero and Automobile Engineering in London.  Professional life  He co-founded Coburn Improvements, a company that custom modified sports and racing cars.\\"What's in a Naim?\\". c. 1978 (courtesy link by Tomtom Club) Archives He then made improvements to a Mini 850 S, which he raced for several seasons. In 1967, he participated in 23 races, of which he won 16 and placed in the rest. After that successful season, he decided to sell his car: it realised about ¬£650 - a small fortune at the time. Vereker worked briefly for Downton Engineering and Janspeed but lost interest in cars.Stewart, Malcolm (April 1989) \\"Naim supremo Julian Vereker talks with Malcolm Steward about his company‚Äôs past, present and future\\". Hi-fi Review. Archived from the original on 11 September 2013. Pursuing his interest in reproduction of sound with 8 mm film, Vereker found that prices were high due to a dearth of supply, and built a machine to perforate recording tape capable of making 6 million feet a year. Vereker founded Naim Audio Visual in 1969. Its first product was a unit capable of switching 30 kW of lighting on and off in time to music. Vereker loved making recordings of his friends but was unsatisfied with the output. Prevailing wisdom at the time was that all amplifiers sounded alike. However, he found this not to be true. Experimentation with pieces of equipment in the sound reproduction chain led him to conclude that amplifying equipment available at the time was of unsatisfactory quality: he could not distinguish different performers, or different kinds of guitar. Working on building mixers based on other peoples' designs, he found that distortion - already visible in oscilloscope traces - and set out to eliminate it through better design. After a year of studying audio transistor circuitry and some experimentation, he decided to make his own amplifier equipment. His first professional audio product, launched in around 1970, was a small mixing desk - the M10.2. The first Naim Audio amplifier was sold in December 1971 - a power amplifier only made initially on demand for friends and acquaintances. In 1973 Vereker won a contract to supply the nascent Capital Radio with 24 single cabinets containing the Naim amplifier and speaker drive units. That July, Naim Audio was incorporated; and in 1974 the company moved from a basement in Salisbury to a 16th-century shop in the city. A pivotal event that same year was Vereker's introduction to a Scot, Ivor Tiefenbrun, who had been developing turntables. Suitably impressed with Vereker's product against the opposition, Ivor began firmly recommending Vereker's amplifiers alongside when he went around hawking his turntable.\\"Julian Vereker's Last Interview\\". c. 1999 (courtesy link by Tomtom Club) Archived from the original on 11 September 2013. Together, they challenged the perceived wisdom at the time within the industry, proving by demonstration alone that indeed all products were not the same. The Linn turntable, partnered with Naim amplifiers, proved to be an unbeatable combination, with sales greatly assisted by Vereker's and Tiefenbrun's confident pitch to potential customers: \\"If you can't hear the difference, it's not worth talking to you\\". In the 1990s and right up to his death, the Naim record label was Vereker's own personal project, devoting his time to coming up with improved techniques for CD mastering. The roster featured many of his friends from the music world. Other achievements For some years Vereker was chairman of the Federation of British Audio. He was appointed an MBE in 1995 for services to British export. Interests and personal life In addition to hi-fi, Vereker worked on cars, boats, computers and lighting systems. He was an enthusiast for bicycle design, and assisted Brompton Bicycle, a start-up company making folding bicycles, with a ¬£40,000 guarantee for its overdraft. Also passionate about sailing, he designed boats: working with boat manufacturer British Hunter, he developed a boat which he called the Windex 49. The prototype of his last venture, with a triangulated mast and a computer-controlled system of active water ballast, was launched on the day he died. Vereker died from cancer on 14 January 2000, aged 54. He was twice married, and had a son and two daughters.

Frank Baum's Land of Oz.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 221. Trot is introduced in the novel, The Sea Fairies (1911) and first appears in an Oz book in The Scarecrow of Oz (1915). Trot is a young girl with big solemn eyes and an earnest, simple manner. Her real name is Mayre Griffiths. It was said that she had been marked on the forehead at birth by fairies with their invisible mystic signs. Her father, Captain Charlie Griffiths, is almost always out to sea. She and Cap'n Bill, for whom Charlie was once first mate, are the closest of friends, and they live at her mother's boarding house on the California coast. They get trapped by way of a whirlpool that deposits them in a cavern deep under the sea, and meet a strange flying creature called the Ork, which carries them to Jinxland, a country on the other side of the Deadly Desert. Trot and Cap'n Bill have many wonderful adventures in the Land of Oz including getting their feet \\"rooted\\" while searching for a gift for Princess Ozma's birthday. Trot is one of Dorothy Gale and Princess Ozma's best friends. She is also the main child protagonist of Ruth Plumly Thompson's Kabumpo in Oz and The Giant Horse of Oz. In Kabumpo in Oz, her doll, Peg Amy, turns out to be the enchanted form of the Princess of Sun-Top Mountain. Peg Amy marries Prince Pompadore of Pumperdink, and in The Purple Prince of Oz, they are shown with a daughter, Princess Pajonia of Pumperdink. In The Giant Horse of Oz, she is made a princess of the Ozure Isles as thanks for her help in restoring the Munchkin queen Orin to her royal husband and son. In this book, it is stated that Trot arrived in Oz and stopped aging at ten, the same age as Prince Philador of the Ozure Isles. Based on L. Frank Baum's statement that Trot is one year younger than Dorothy Gale and that Dorothy is one year younger than Betsy Bobbin, we get the other characters' ages through backward reasoning, but since this information is derived from two different authors, it is canon, but not necessarily true to Baum's intentions. Eric Shanower and Glenn Ingersoll wrote a novella titled Trot of Oz, published in Oz-story Magazine in 2000.Glenn Ingersoll and Eric Shanower, \\"Trot in Oz,\\" Oz-story Magazine No. 6 (September 2000), pp. 86-133.

Biography Tas Bull was born in Sydney in 1932. His first name was a combination of Tasmania and Norway, the respective birth places of his mother and father. He grew up in a working-class household in Tasmania. His father, an electrical contractor, had been a seaman. He was raised a member of the Salvation Army. He went to sea in 1946 and became active in the Seamen's Union of Australia (SUA), then aligned with the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), which Bull joined in 1951. He left the CPA in 1959, following the suppression of the Hungarian revolution by the Soviet Union. After his marriage Bull became a waterside worker in Hobart, joining the powerful Waterside Workers' Federation (WWF), and was soon a job delegate. Later he worked in Melbourne, then Sydney, becoming an experienced negotiator. In Sydney he undertook an industrial law course at Sydney University Law School. In 1967 he was elected a Vigilance Officer; in 1971 he was elected Federal Organiser, and later Assistant General Secretary. In 1984 he succeeded Charlie Fitzgibbon as General Secretary, a post he held until 1992. He also became prominent in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He became an ACTU Vice President in 1987, and Senior Vice President in 1991. Bull led the WWF during the period of radical change on the waterfront. Technological change was greatly reducing the size of the workforce, while at the same time there was political pressure to reform waterfront work practices to make the Australian transport sector internationally competitive. In response a process of waterfront reform was begun by the Hawke Labor government. Bull co-operated with the reform, while defending his members' interests. In 1993 the WWF amalgamated with the SUA to form the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). Bull was also active in international trade union affairs. From 1972 onwards he worked with the International Transport Workers' Federation, and for ten years until 1993 represented the Asia/Pacific region on its executive board. Following his retirement in 1993 Bull remained active in various left-wing and union causes, and published his autobiography Life on the Waterfront in 1998.

Biography Bethancourt was born in El Paso, Texas, United States. He began learning banjo at age 9, after he heard his maternal grandfather, C. H. Burnett, playing fiddle. His first banjo was given him by his grandfather, and was \\"an old S.S. Stewart.\\" This banjo is now in the able hands of his nephew, Tom Purtill. When his family moved to Phoenix for the final time, in 1961, he began learning guitar, hanging around coffeehouses, mariachi bands, bluegrass groups, and a place called \\"J.D.'s,\\" where he would sneak in to listen to such local artists as Waylon Jennings. With the \\"folk boom\\" of the '60's just hitting its stride, he found that all that music he had learned as a child stood in good stead. His first \\"real pro\\" gig came at age 18. The Phoenix acoustic scene was active and thriving and Bethancourt associated with John Denver, the Irish Rovers and Jim Connor (\\"Grandma's Feather Bed\\"), and with some of the best in Dixieland, Ragtime, and traditional Mexican musicians. He spent a stint with a local bluegrass band, Ma Tucker's String Band, playing with Jeff Gylkinson (The Dillards) and Doug Haywood (keyboard player/songwriter for Jackson Browne). He also worked with noted entertainer Dan \\"Igor\\" Glenn in several bands. Bethancourt credited \\"Igor\\" with teaching him much about the entertainer's art. In 1968‚Äì1969, Bethancourt worked in L.A. as a studio musician, where he made his first record, \\"The Joe Bethancourt String Concert Album\\" which was favorably reviewed by Billboard, receiving a four star rating.Billboard magazine, 28 February 1970 Bethancourt returned to Phoenix, where he became influential in the original underground radio scene, hosting his own radio show on KDKB, \\"Folk Music Occasional,\\" with Bill Compton. He was also a regular on the Emmy award-winning Wallace and Ladmo Show on KPHO-TV (Ch.5) in the 1980s, and worked with children in the Arizona Commission for the Arts' \\"Artists in Education\\" program for about 6 years. He performed occasional Artist Residencies at local elementary schools throughout his life. For almost 17 years, Bethancourt was the house band at Funny Fellows, a Phoenix restaurant, performing with his large collection of traditional and non-traditional instruments. During this time, he was instrumental in founding the Arizona chapter of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). Bethancourt eventually left the organization, but retained his membership in the Dark Horde. His Filk music within the SCA, under his Society name of 'Master Ioseph of Locksley', is considered influential on the acoustic music scene in Phoenix, crediting him for much of their style and technique. He played 65 different instruments; including banjos, 12-string guitar, cittern, Celtic harp, lute, and Ozark mouthbow. Bethancourt was nominated for the Arizona Governor's Arts Award, and his recordings are now on file at the University of East Tennessee's Appalachian Archives Folklore collection. He was also on the advisory board of the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. Lynn Anderson called him \\"a genius\\" in the Summer 2007 issue of Western Way magazine. He operated his own production company, White Tree Productions, and has recorded solo, with another noted songwriter, Leslie Fish, and with the neo-Celtic band The Bringers, all for Random Factors of Los Angeles. He taught acoustic instruments of all kinds out of Boogie Music in Phoenix, Arizona, and was active in an historical reenactment group, the 9th Memorial Cavalry. On 30 March 2013, Bethancourt was inducted into the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame. He was based in Phoenix, Arizona. Bethancourt died on August 28, 2014, after a long illness.

He was a quarterback for the University of Illinois during their 2001 Big Ten Championship. Biography=High school career Kittner was quarterback for Schaumburg High School under then-coach Tom Cerasani. College career Becoming a starter near the end of his freshman year at Illinois under head coach Ron Turner, Kittner became one of the most prolific passers in Illinois history. He ended his tenure at Illinois as the school's all-time leader in career passing attempts (1,264), career passing touchdowns (70), passing touchdowns in a single season (27), and victories as a quarterback (24). Kittner wrapped up his collegiate career only 3 yards shy of Jack Trudeau's Illini record for all time passing yards. Entering his senior year, Kurt was considered a possible Heisman candidate. Kittner and receiver Brandon Lloyd led Illinois' offense as the Fighting Illini finished with a 7‚Äì1 record in the Big Ten and won their first Big Ten championship in 11 years on their way to a berth in the 2002 Sugar Bowl. Kittner's last collegiate game ended in a 47‚Äì34 loss against the LSU Tigers. Professional careerAtlanta Falcons= Kittner was drafted in the 5th round of the 2002 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. He saw no action in his rookie year, being third-string quarterback behind Doug Johnson and 2001 first overall pick, Michael Vick. In 2003, after a preseason injury sidelined Vick and ineffective play caused second-string quarterback Doug Johnson to be benched, Kittner saw his first regular season action. Playing in seven games (four of which he started), he threw for 391 yards, scoring 2 touchdowns and throwing 6 interceptions. The highlight was a 27‚Äì7 win over the New York Giants at Giants Stadium where Kittner threw for a touchdown. The Falcons ended the season however with a 5‚Äì11 record. =Turbulent times= Since then, Kittner has not seen any further playing time in the NFL, having been released from 5 different teams (the Falcons, Bengals, Giants, Patriots, and Steelers) in a 7-month span during the 2004 offseason. He did manage to make headlines in 2005, leading the Amsterdam Admirals to an NFL Europe World Bowl Championship. His 239 passing yards and two touchdowns in World Bowl XIII earned him Most Valuable Player honors for the game. He is the second graduate of Schaumburg High School to earn the honor; Paul Justin won the award 10 years earlier for the Frankfurt Galaxy. =Chicago Bears= In 2005, Kittner was invited to training camp with the Chicago Bears and coach Turner, then offensive coordinator for Chicago. He earned a roster spot as the third-string quarterback. After starter Rex Grossman was injured in camp, journeyman Jeff Blake was brought in to back up rookie starter Kyle Orton, leaving Kittner at third string. When Grossman returned from injury on November 23, 2005, Kittner was released without playing a regular season down for the Bears. Life after football Kittner currently resides in Chicago with his wife Leila Cehajic, a former University of Illinois tennis player. He works for Jones Lang LaSalle in Chicago doing commercial real estate. In July 2007, Kittner was named the color analyst for University of Illinois football radio broadcasts, replacing long-time analyst Jim Grabowski.

The term Evangelical Catholic (from Catholic meaning universal and evangelical, meaning Gospel-centered) is used in Lutheranism, alongside the term Augsburg Catholic, with those calling themselves Evangelical Catholic Lutherans or Lutherans of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship stressing the catholicity of historic Lutheranism in liturgy (such as the Mass), beliefs (such as the perpetual virginity of Mary), practices (such as genuflection), and doctrines (such as apostolic succession). Evangelical Catholics teach that Lutheranism at its core \\"is deeply and fundamentally catholic\\". The majority of Evangelical Catholic Lutheran clergy and Evangelical Catholic Lutheran parishes are members of mainstream Lutheran denominations. Evangelical Catholic Lutheranism Mikael Agricola Lutheran Church in Helsinki, juxtaposed with a chancel lamp and note about the real presence The Augsburg Confession as a Catholic document The Augsburg Confession found within the Book of Concord, a compendium of belief of the Lutheran Churches, teaches that \\"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\\". When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530, they believed it \\"showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils\\". The Augsburg Confession further states that: > ...one holy Church is to continue forever. The Church is the congregation of > saints, in which the Gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly > administered. In Lutheranism, the term Evangelical Catholic or Augsburg Catholic has a specific meaning. Lutheran Protestantism differs historically from most other kinds of Protestantism in that Lutheranism is the only historical Protestant denomination that confesses belief in three sacraments: regeneration in Holy Baptism, Confession as the sacrament of Absolution, and the Real Presence of Christ in Holy Eucharist. In Anglicanism and Methodism, two other Protestant traditions, there has also been a sacramentalism similar to that in orthodox Lutheranism, especially in the high church movement. The Book of Concord states, contrary to \\"Enthusiast\\" belief, that salvation can be received only through the means of grace: God's Word and sacraments. The Augsburg Confession stresses that \\"in doctrine and ceremonies nothing has been received on our part against Scripture or the Catholic Church.\\" Article XXIV of the Augsburg Confession \\"Of the Mass\\" states: \\"Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence.\\" Some Lutheran church bodies claim to also have retained the historical episcopate and apostolic succession. The evangelical feature of Lutheranism is justification by faith, as defined by Law and Gospel and simul iustus et peccator. The term evangelical has a different origin and meaning in Lutheranism than in \\"Evangelicalism\\". (In German, there is a difference between and ; in Swedish, there is a corresponding difference between and ). In the Lutheran tradition, evangelical () refers to the gospel, with the specific meaning of \\"grace centered\\". The opposite of evangelical is not \\"catholic\\" or \\"liberal\\", but legalistic. Woodcut of the Augsburg Confession, Article VII, \\"Of the Church\\". Lutherans of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship regard the Augsburg Confession as a thoroughly Catholic document. Gnesio-Lutherans and the continuity of Apostolic Christianity In early Lutheranism, the Gnesio-Lutherans compiled the first modern critical history of the world, the Magdeburg Centuries, to show that the Lutheran Church was a continuation of the Christian Church throughout its history, though stripped of abuses originating from the pope. Gnesio-Lutherans like Joachim Westphal and Andreas Musculus had a 'high' understanding of the sacraments, and therefore were strongly opposed to any compromise with Calvinism and Zwingliism, as well as with Roman Catholic doctrine. In the era of Lutheran orthodoxy, theologians Martin Chemnitz and Johann Gerhard (especially in his Confessio Catholica) made extensive use of patristic sources. They saw the continuity of the pre-Reformation Church in Lutheranism, which they understood not as a re-formation of the Church, but rather a renewal movement within and for the Christian Church, from which the Roman Church did truly represent. With regard to the nature of the Church, Lutheran theology therefore holds that: Lutheran monasticism Loccum Abbey continued as a Lutheran monastery since the 16th century A.D. Evangelical Catholics of Lutheran churchmanship cherish the practice of Christian monasticism; after the Reformation, many monasteries and convents adopted the Lutheran faith and continued religious life, including lay oblates. Examples include monasteries such as Amelungsborn Abbey near Negenborn and Loccum Abbey in Rehburg-Loccum, as well as convents such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde. New religious orders were established by Lutherans throughout the centuries such as √ñstanb√§ck Monastery, a Benedictine community in Sala, Sweden and Saint Augustine's House, a monastery in Michigan. Mother Basilea Schlink established the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary in Darmstadt, which contains the motherhouse where the Lutheran nuns reside. The Order of Lutheran Franciscans is a religious institute affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Sacred art in Lutheranism Lutherans had different views regarding religious imagery than Reformed Christians. Martin Luther in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the \\"ancient, apostolic church\\". Lutheran altarpieces like the Last Supper by the younger Cranach were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend Lucas Cranach, to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional depiction of Jesus. As such, \\"Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior.\\" Lutherans proudly employed the use of the crucifix as it highlighted their high view of the Theology of the Cross. Stories grew up of \\"indestructible\\" images of Luther, that had survived fires, by divine intervention.Michalski, 89 Thus, for Lutherans, \\"the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.\\" As such, \\"Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere.\\" Lutherans strongly defended their existing sacred art from a new wave of Reformed-on- Lutheran iconoclasm in the second half of the century, as Reformed rulers or city authorities attempted to impose their will on Lutheran populations in the \\"Second Reformation\\" of about 1560-1619.Michalski, 84. Google books Against the Reformed, Lutherans exclaimed: \\"You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return\\". The Beeldenstorm, a large and very disorderly wave of Calvinist mob destruction of images and church fittings that spread through the Low Countries in the summer of 1566 was the largest outbreak of this sort, with drastic political repercussions. This campaign of Reformed iconoclasm \\"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\\" in Germany and \\"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\\" in the Baltic region. Lutheran devotions Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune, Strasbourg Lutheran Mariology is informed by the Augsburg Confession and honours Mary as \\"the most blessed Mother of God, the most blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of Christ,\\" and \\"the Queen of Heaven.\\" The Smalcald Articles, a confession of faith of the Lutheran Churches, affirm the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary. Lutherans of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship tend to stress a continuity with these pre-Reformational beliefs that have been upheld by many Lutherans theologians since Martin Luther himself. As a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Martin Luther advocated the use of the original version of the Hail Mary prayer before it was modified at the Roman Catholic Church's Council of Trent (that is, \\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\\")Luther's Works, 10 II, 407‚Äì409 The 1522 Betb√ºchlein (Prayer Book) retained the Ave Maria. The Wreath of Christ, also known as the Pearls of Life, is a set of prayer beads developed by the Swedish, Evangelic-Lutheran bishop Martin L√∂nnebo. They are devotion used by communicants in the Lutheran Churches. Episcopal polity and apostolic succession Nathan S√∂derblom is ordained as archbishop of the Church of Sweden, 1914. Traditions, such as episcopal polity and apostolic succession are also maintained and seen as essential by Lutherans of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship; the Church of Sweden for example teaches that \\"Since this ordinance was very useful and without doubt proceeded from the Holy Ghost, it was generally approved and accepted over the whole of Christendom. . . . It belongs to the office of the Bishop that he in his diocese shall ordain and govern with Priests, and do whatsoever else is required.\\" The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Church of Sweden continue the apostolic succession of bishops who ordain priests through the laying on of hands. Such a view sees the congregational form of church governance as non-Lutheran and not reflective of Lutheranism's identity as a catholic Church; the Evangelical Catholic Church, a Lutheran denomination based in North America, taught: These views have proved to be influential in all of Lutheranism, especially when ecumenical agreements between Churches are made; in the largest Lutheran denomination in United States, for example, \\"all episcopal installations in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America take place with the participation of bishops in the apostolic succession.\\" Evangelical Catholicism in the Lutheran Churches A votive candle rack stands before an icon of Christ Pantocrator in a Luthearn parish church of the Church of Sweden in Skellefte√•. In the 19th century, \\"Evangelical Catholicism\\" was seen as a vision for the Church of the future. The term was used by Lutherans such as Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach and Heinrich Leo within the post-Prussian Union church in Germany who were inspired by the church of the Middle Ages, and by neo-Lutheran Friedrich Julius Stahl. The term Evangelical Catholic is often used today instead of the term \\"High Church Lutheranism\\" because it is a theological term. It is comparable to the term \\"Anglo-Catholic\\" within Anglicanism. Evangelical Catholic Lutheranism is not strictly defined, and can mean, for example, the theologically, biblically, and socially conservative ultra-high church Lutheranism of the strongly Roman Catholic-oriented Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church and the more Eastern Orthodox-oriented Evangelical Catholic Church, those within the Confessional Lutheran movement who follow the late Arthur Carl Piepkorn, the Evangelical Catholic Orthodoxy of Gunnar Rosendal, the more theologically liberal high ecclesiology of Carl Braaten, the very liberal Evangelical Catholicity of Nathan S√∂derblom, or even the more liberal Catholicism of Friedrich Heiler, and the ecumenical vision of Hans Asmussen and Max Lackmann. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada defines its doctrinal basis as such: \\"We derive our teachings from the Holy Scriptures and confess the three ecumenical creeds of the Christian church. We hold to orthodox catholic theology as enunciated in the ecumenical councils of the first five centuries of Christianity.\\" Some small \\"Evangelical Catholic\\" church bodies include the Evangelical Catholic Church, Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, Lutheran Church - International and the Lutheran Episcopal Communion. The Nordic Catholic Church in Norway has roots in High Church Lutheranism. However, most Evangelical Catholic Lutheran clergy and Evangelical Lutheran parishes are part of mainstream Lutheran denominations such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Evangelical Church in Germany and Church of Sweden. Many Lutherans hold beliefs that would be characterized as being of the Evangelical Catholic churchmanship of Lutheranism, but prefer to be called simply as \\"Lutherans\\" as they view the catholic nature of Lutheranism to be inherent in Lutheranism and prefer to stress the unity within Lutheranism as a whole. In 1976 Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, suggested that the Augsburg Confession might be possible to recognise as a Catholic statement of faith. This did not happen due to differences in understanding of the theology on justification. Various Roman Catholic leaders and theolgians, such as Cardinal Kurt Koch have proposed the idea of Lutheran Ordinariates within the Catholic Church, which would allow Lutherans to join the Catholic Church and retain aspects of their liturgy and traditions. Lutherans of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship, however, have opposed conversion to Roman Catholicism, arguing that the \\"riches of the catholic tradition are already ours, and at our best we embrace that heritage\\". Other Christian traditions Apart from its usage in Lutheranism, Evangelical catholic (catholic is the noun with evangelical modifying) can refer variously to: *Evangelical Protestants who consider themselves to be catholic in the sense that they identify with the historic Christian Church. They believe that the early general councils and the Protestant Reformation were both part of the progressive illumination of the Holy Spirit; *Roman Catholics who in continuity with the long tradition of the Church and empowered by Pope Benedict XVI's proclaimed New Evangelization stress the centrality and salvific universality of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the necessity of proclaiming it, in many ways identifying with the evangelical movement. Catholic Church As used by the Roman Catholic Church, the term evangelical Catholic refers to Roman Catholics in full communion with the Holy See in Rome who exhibit, according to Alister McGrath, the four characteristics of evangelicalism. The first is a strong theological and devotional emphasis on the Christian scriptures. Secondly, evangelical Catholics stress the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as the cause of salvation for all mankind. A personal need for interior conversion is the third defining mark, and, consequently, the fourth is a deep commitment to evangelization. Evangelical Catholics see these evangelical emphases as the core of the 2,000-year tradition of Catholic Christianity. Evangelical preaching movements such as St. Dominic's, who was called the Vir Evangelicus (evangelical man), are a common point of reference. To Catholics, the term 'evangelical' refers to its etymological root‚Äîthe Greek word euangelion‚Äîwhich means 'good news' or 'Gospel', not to Protestant Evangelicalism. To Catholics, being evangelical is understood in the context of the adherence to the dogma and Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church and in a Catholic interpretation of Scripture, and not in the doctrinal and ecclesiological upheavals of the Protestant Reformation. Increasingly, the Roman Catholic Church is appropriating the evangelical witness of the recent popes and their encyclicals, especially Pope Paul VI's Evangelii nuntiandi (On Evangelization in the Modern World), John Paul II's Redemptoris missio (The Mission of the Redeemer), and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's Declaration Dominus Iesus (The Lord Jesus), for which Pope Benedict XVI was primarily responsible, when he was previously Prefect of the Congregation. New bibles, catechetical materials, youth ministry programs, and young adult ministries witness to greater evangelical zeal within the Church. College campus ministry and parish ministry are focusing more of their resources on outreach (pre- evangelization and evangelization). A Catholic organization called the Evangelical Catholic exists for the purpose of equipping Catholic ministries to be evangelical. In Greenville, South Carolina, a Catholic organization called the Center for Evangelical Catholicism exists for the purpose of spreading the \\"New Evangelization\\" program of the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization in Roman Catholic parishes and schools across the United States. Since the call to evangelization is so integral to the Catholic faith and solidly attested to in the ecumenical councils, the writings of the Church Fathers, and papal teaching, the late well-known Father Richard John Neuhaus (1936-2009), (a former longtime Evangelical Lutheran pastor) looked to the day when the term 'evangelical Catholic' would be redundant - when identifying as 'Catholic' would imply active evangelization so strongly that the addition of 'evangelical' would be unnecessary.Evangelicals and Catholics Together: Toward a Common Mission, Thomas Nelson, 1995, . As a group, they are often not disaggregated in social science research, though there have been recent calls to change this.Higgins, Nicholas \\"Religious Influences on Latino ideoloyg and vote choice: Are Evangelical Catholics different?\\" Politics Groups and Identities, 2014 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21565503.2014.926821 Old Catholicism, Methodism, and Reformed Christianity In recent years, the term Evangelical Catholic, has been adopted by high church elements of the Methodist and Reformed Churches. This is especially apt among the Reformed, given that one of the older documented uses of the term is by John Williamson Nevin and Philip Schaff, during their efforts (from roughly 1841 forward) to repristinate the theology of the German Reformed Church in the United States. In 1849 the Mercersburg Review was founded as the organ of their \\"Mercersburg Theology\\". Beginning in 1851, William Augustus M√ºhlenberg, the Protestant Episcopal clergyman of Lutheran background, and father of the Ritualist movement in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, also published a periodical called \\"The Evangelical Catholic.\\" Muhlenberg's vision has influenced the Reformed Episcopal Church and some on the Free Church of England. Already earlier, there was an evangelical revival in the Roman Catholic Church in Germany, involving Boos, Gossner and Feneberg. This evangelical revivalist movement also spread to German Lutheranism. The Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church in Portugal has its origins in the Old Catholic movement of the 19th century. Today it belongs to the Anglican Communion. In England, Ulric Vernon Herford (1866‚Äì1938), irregularly consecrated as Mar Jacobus, Bishop of Mercia & Middlesex, founded The Evangelical Catholic Communion. His succession line was brought to the United States in the 1960s and continues in the Syro-Chaldean Church of North America. Some members of various Christian denominations may use the term Evangelical Catholic to indicate the fact that they are evangelical and maintain their catholicity. For example, Methodists and Presbyterians believe their denominations owe their origins to the Apostles and the early church, but do not claim descent from ancient church structures such as the episcopate. However, both of these churches hold that they are a part of the catholic (universal) church. According to Harper's New Monthly Magazine: As such, according to one viewpoint, for those who \\"belong to the Church,\\" the term Methodist Catholic, or Presbyterian Catholic, or Baptist Catholic, is as proper as the term Roman Catholic. It simply means that body of Christian believers over the world who agree in their religious views, and accept the same ecclesiastical forms. New church bodies At the end of the 20th century, the Convergence Movement formed new church bodies, including the Charismatic Episcopal Church, the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches and the King's Family of Churches. It governs by an Episcopal polity, embraces the Charismatic renewal, uses different liturgical versions in worship, both Anglican and Lutheran, and supports church missions and church planting..

Early life Saavedra was raised in Thousand Oaks, California along with his six siblings, among them cartoonist/illustrator Scott Saavedra (‚ÄúDr. Radium‚Äù) and KFI AM 640 radio personality Neil Saavedra (The Jesus Christ Show). He is married to cinematographer/director Joaquin Sedillo. Shortly after graduating high school, Saavedra found employment at Universal Studios in Hollywood as a tour guide. In the evenings, he attended film courses at UCLA‚Äôs Extension program. It was through this program that he met a film executive who eventually hired him as a story analyst at producer Jerry Weintraub‚Äôs Weintraub Entertainment Group. Shortly thereafter, Saavedra left to become Director of Operations at Big Time Picture Company, a post- production and film editing facility on Los Angeles‚Äô west side. Producer/Director=Pro FilmWorks / Becker FilmWorks Entertainment At Big Time Picture Company, Saavedra met Gregg Hoffman from nearby PRO FilmWorks, and was recruited to join PRO as a development executive. At PRO FilmWorks, Saavedra was promoted to Vice President of Production and soon was producing and/or supervising the production/development of numerous projects, including the films Scorchers (1991), Only You (1992). In 1993, PRO FilmWorks changed its name to Becker FilmWorks Entertainment, reflecting its ties with Australian parent company Becker Entertainment. Saavedra was promoted to President of the Los Angeles operations, and lead the production and development of such films as Gross Misconduct (1993), The Real Macaw (1998), At First Sight (1999), and the television series The Man from Snowy River (1993‚Äì96). In 1997, Saavedra took on the director's role for the Becker FilmWorks Entertainment comedy-drama Rhapsody in Bloom, released in early 1998. Shortly after the release of Rhapsody in Bloom, Saavedra left Becker FilmWorks to focus on writing both motion picture and theatrical works. Starry Night Entertainment In 2004, Saavedra teamed with Michael Shulman, a recent Yale graduate and former child actor, including a role as a teenager in Rhapsody in Bloom, to form Starry Night Entertainment.

Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case that rejected the argument that a separate opinion privilege existed against libel.. It was seen by legal commentators as the end of an era that began with New York Times Co. v. Sullivan and continued with Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., in which the court clarified and greatly expanded the range and scope of what could be said in the press without fear of litigation.. The case took a long time to come before the court, which twice declined to hear it. When it finally did, the justices suggested they would clarify once and for all the extent to which opinions could be expressed without fear of being held libellous. The actual decision, however, was regarded as having confused the issue somewhat instead. Several state courts have responded by recognizing an opinion privilege in some way as part of their state constitution. Background of the case On February 8, 1974, a key high school wrestling match between teams from the Cleveland suburbs of Maple Heights and Mentor, fierce rivals at the time, degenerated into a brawl in which first the Maple Heights team, then its fans, attacked the Mentor squad. Several members were hospitalized as a result. Allegedly, many present believed that Mike Milkovich, then the Maple Heights High School coach, had played a large part in causing the brawl by publicly criticizing decisions made by referees and inciting the crowd. At a hearing shortly afterwards, the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) put the school on probation for a year and ruled Maple Heights ineligible for the next year's state tournament. Several wrestlers and their parents filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, where cases against the state are commonly heard. Petitioners argued that OHSAA had denied them due process. After a hearing that November in which both Milkovich and the school district's superintendent, H. Donald Scott, testified again, the court granted a temporary injunction against OHSAA's ruling. The following day, Ted Diadiun, a sports writer and columnist for the News Herald, Mentor's daily newspaper, wrote about the decision. He had been at the original wrestling match and the OHSAA hearing but not at the court hearing. He did, however, quote OHSAA commissioner Harold Meyer as saying that \\"some of the stories told to the judge sounded pretty darned unfamiliar.... It certainly sounded different from what they told us\\" but without citing any specific examples. On that apparent basis, his column took it as a given that Milkovich and Scott had lied to the court and took them to task for demonstrating to their students that they could do so with impunity in order to avoid accountability for their actions. \\"Anyone who attended the meet,\\" Diadiun wrote, \\"whether he be from Maple Heights, Mentor, or impartial observer, knows in his heart that Milkovich and Scott lied at the hearing after each having given his solemn oath to tell the truth.\\" Litigation history Milkovich filed suit, alleging that the suggestion that he had lied had defamed him. Since perjury is a felony in Ohio, the statements were found to be defamatory and Milkovich was ruled a private figure, both of which were helpful to his case. However, the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the newspaper since it found Diadiun's column to be a statement of opinion, which cannot be libelous, and that there was no actual malice, per Sullivan. Milkovich appealed to the Ohio Eleventh District Court of Appeals, which found that there was actual malice. In turn, the newspaper appealed to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed it on the grounds that there were no significant constitutional issues. In 1979 the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. On remand, the trial court issued summary judgment in favor of the respondents, this time citing Gertz in ruling the original column to be constitutionally protected opinion. In addition, it said, Milkovich had failed, as a public figure, to establish a prima facie claim of actual malice. The appeals court upheld the trial court once again, only to be reversed by the Ohio Supreme Court. Another certiorari petition made its way to Washington in 1984, and met with the same fate as its predecessor. In the interim, Scott had been pursuing a separate action which the Ohio Supreme Court considered in 1986. In ruling the column to be opinion, OSC applied a four-pronged test which had come out of Ollman v. Evans, a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in determining whether Diadiun's column was opinion or fact for purposes of libel law. It announced also that it was reconsidering its decision in Milkovich. The trial court again granted summary judgment, the appeals court upheld and the state Supreme Court, as it had the first time around, dismissed the appeal. This time the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. The court's decision Observers and First Amendment law experts had expected that the Court would formalize its observation in Gertz that \\"there is no such thing as a false idea\\" into an opinion privilege against libel claims, expanding the traditional fair comment defense. They were taken aback when it declined to, instead suggesting that the constitutional safeguards it had already erected were enough to protect statements of opinion from being actionable. Majority opinion After recounting the case history and the court's recent rulings in libel cases, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority that the statement from Gertz was not \\"intended to create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything that might be labeled 'opinion'\\" since \\"expressions of 'opinion' may often imply an assertion of objective fact.\\"Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 18. Diadiun's column, it found, strongly suggested that Milkovich perjured himself and was not couched hyperbolically, figuratively or in any other way that would mean the writer didn't seriously mean it. And since that statement could easily be found true or false by comparing Milkovich's statements at the OHSAA hearing with his court testimony (which the column did not do), it was moot whether it was intended as opinion or not since it asserted a matter of objective fact. \\"The connotation that petitioner committed perjury is sufficiently factual to be susceptible of being proved true or false,\\" the Court concluded.Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 21. Dissent \\"The majority does not rest its decision today on any finding that the statements at issue explicitly state a false and defamatory fact. Nor could it,\\" wrote Justice Brennan in his dissent.Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 28 (Brennan, J., dissenting). He and Justice Marshall agreed with the lower courts that there was sufficient indication that the column was opinion to protect it as such: it was on the sports page, it had a picture of the author with \\"TD Says\\" in it, and in the text itself, \\"Diadiun not only reveals the facts upon which he is relying, but he makes it clear at which point he runs out of facts and is simply guessing.\\" He notes that Diadiun used \\"apparently\\" when referring to Milkovich and Scott's testimony in Columbus and that no one could take \\"knows in his heart\\" as a statement of literal fact, as it is inherently hyperbolic. \\"Readers could see that Diadiun was focused on the court's reversal of the OHSAA's decision, and was angrily supposing what must have led to it,\\" he concluded.Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 30 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Citing several recent historical incidents where many commentators had speculated as to what had occurred with much less complete knowledge of the facts, he said \\"conjecture is a means of fueling a national discourse on such questions and stimulating public pressure for answers from those who know more ... Punishing (it) protects reputation only at the cost of expunging a genuinely useful mechanism for public debate.\\"Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 35 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, even in arguing for Diadiun's right to express such a bold opinion without fear of being sued, he chastised the columnist for his \\"na√Øvet√©\\" in assuming that since the court overturned OHSAA, Milkovich had therefore lied under oath. \\"To anyone who understands the patois of the legal profession, there is no reason to assume ‚Äî from the court's decision ‚Äî that such testimony must have been given,\\" since the Franklin County judge could have overturned the athletic association's decision for a number of reasons and the column itself notes the denial of due process as the reason. Subsequent jurisprudence Lower courts had been relying on their standards for distinguishing expressions of opinion from statements of fact in defamation actions for several years' Having expected Milkovich to give them some test or standard to apply, they were caught off guard when the Supreme Court backed off.. Since Milkovich, there have been no significant defamation rulings by the court. Free-speech advocates, however, continue to press and hope for the recognition of an opinion privilege. In 2004, the court denied certiorari in Santa Barbara News- Press v. Ross, a case in which the appellant sought to establish that corporate executives such as the appellee were automatically public figures. State interpretations State courts responded by filling in the gap, grounding an opinion privilege in their own constitutions. New York's ruled that as long as an opinion relied on accurately stated and reported facts, it was not actionable as long as the content, tone and apparent purpose of the statement distinguished it as opinion. This privilege does not apply, however, to any accusations of criminal or illegal activity. Illinois courts required that the factual basis of a statement must be clearly disclosed for it to qualify as opinion. Any statement of opinion without underlying facts is to be treated as a factual assertion per se. If it implies the existence of undisclosed facts which are false and defamatory, it is actionable. False statements of fact couched in an opinion context are actionable unless clearly set aside by \\"loose, figurative or hyperbolic language.\\"Rose, 889 N.E.2d at 648 (quoting Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 21). Texas applied Milkovich more literally . Prior to it, only statements of fact were actionable. Afterwards , opinions that imply false statements of objective fact were held by at least one court to be unprotected, and it declared that there was no opinion privilege in Texas. In 1991, a California appellate court, in the case Kahn v. Bower, rejected the claim that a \\"categorical exception for opinion exists independently under California law\\". Disposition After the Supreme Court ruled against them, the Journal Co. reached an out of court settlement with Milkovich, who had by that time retired. Milkovich and Diadiun have since reconciled and appeared together at panel discussions of the case and First Amendment law. Diadiun remains in journalism, serving as an editorial writer for The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com.

His disciples include Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi,Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (His Great disciple was Hazrat Maulana Syed Shah Waris Hasan Former (sabiq) Shahi Imam Jama Masjid Shahi Teela Shah Peer Muhmmad Sahab (Teele Wali Masjid) Lucknow) and Ashraf Ali Thanwi. In the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he led the Muslims in Thana Bhawan to fight against British. Early life Imdadullah Muhaajir Makki was born in Nanauta, Mughal India in 1817. His father Muhammad Amƒ´n named him Imdad Hussain, however, Shah Muhammad Ishaq gave him the name of ImdƒÅdullah.http://www.hadhrat.com/haji- imdadullah-muhajir-makki-r-a/, Profile of Haji Imdadullah, Retrieved 26 March 2017 Aged 7, ImdƒÅdullah lost his mother who wrote her will that none shall touch her kid after her, and kept ImdƒÅdullah more beloved to her in those seven years; this became a hurdle that no one took care of ImdƒÅdullah's education. He then started memorizing the Quran on his own but failed to do so. Aged 16, he traveled to Delhi with Mamluk Ali Nanautawi to seek education. Religious work and travels At the age of eighteen, his bay'at was accepted by Nasiruddin Naqshbandi. Later he went to study under Mianji (Noor Mohammad Jhanjhanvi), as an initiate of the Chishti-Sabiri Sufi order, but after Mianji's death he temporarily became a semi-recluse. After wandering in the wilderness for six months he was overcome by a strong urge to travel to Medina. On December 7, 1845, he arrived at Banares. From there, he departed for Arabia for Hajj and pilgrimage of the tomb of shrine of Muhammad. After the completion of his hajj, Imadadullah remained with Ishaq Muhajir Makki and others. Shah informed him that, after his pilgrimage to Medina, he should return to India. Sayyid Qudratullah Banarasi Makki sent several of his murids to accompany him to Medina. Freedom struggle against the British In Thana Bhawan, the local Sunnis declared Imdadullah their leader. In May 1857 the Battle of Shamli took place between the forces of Haji Imdadullah and the British. Disciples Disciples include: * Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi * Rashid Ahmad Gangohi * Muhammad Yaqub Nanautawi * Mahmud Hasan Deobandi * Sayyid Asghar Hussain Deobandi * Sayyid Muhammad Abid * Ashraf Ali Thanwi Marriages Imdadullah married for the first time when he was 48 years old. After the death of his first wife, he married a blind widow. Because she was blind, she could not manage all household work, so she requested him to take another wife so all household work. Imdadullah then married for the third time. None of his three wives bore him children.  Poetry =Examples In Makki's poem in Imdad ul Mushtaq regarding his teacher Noor Muhammad, he says: ÿ™ŸÖ €ÅŸà ÿß€í ŸÜŸàÿ± ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿÆÿßÿµ ŸÖÿ≠ÿ®Ÿàÿ® ÿÆÿØÿß €ÅŸÜÿØ ŸÖ€å⁄∫ €ÅŸà ŸÜÿßÿ¶ÿ® ÿ≠ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ™ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÖÿµÿ∑ŸÅ€åŸ∞ ÿ™ŸÖ ŸÖÿØÿØ ⁄Øÿßÿ± ŸÖÿØÿØÿåÿßŸÖÿØÿßÿØ ⁄©Ÿà Ÿæ⁄æÿ± ÿÆŸàŸÅ ⁄©€åÿß ÿπÿ¥ŸÇ ⁄©€å Ÿæÿ± ÿ≥ŸÜ ⁄©€í ÿ®ÿßÿ™€å⁄∫ ⁄©ÿßŸÜŸæÿ™€í €Å€å⁄∫ ÿØÿ≥ÿ™ Ÿà Ÿæÿß ÿß€í ÿ¥€Å ŸÜŸàÿ± ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØÿåŸàŸÇÿ™ €Å€í ÿßŸÖÿØÿßÿØ ⁄©ÿß ÿ¢ÿ≥ÿ±ÿß ÿØŸÜ€åÿß ŸÖ€å⁄∫ €Å€í ÿßÿ≤ ÿ®ÿ≥ ÿ™ŸÖ€Åÿßÿ±€å ÿ∞ÿßÿ™ ⁄©ÿß This translates into English as: You are, O Noor Muhammad, the remarkably beloved of Allah; you are the deputy of Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa pbuh in India.

(\\"Mike\\") Darwin, formerly known as Michael Federowicz, (born April 26, 1955) was the president of the cryonics organization Alcor Life Extension Foundation from 1983 to 1988, and Research Director until 1992. He was also the founder and president of BioPreservation, Inc., and a cofounder, member of the Board of Directors, and Director of Research of Twenty-First Century Medicine (a cryobiological/critical care medicine research company) from 1993 to 1999. Early life He was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. Because of his interest in evolution and rejection of creationism he earned himself the nickname \\"Darwin\\" among his schoolmates. Michael had a fascination with cryopreserving organisms as a young child. In 1968, at the age of 12, he qualified for the Indiana state science fair with his project \\"Suspended Animation in Animals and Plants.\\" He dreamed of becoming an astronaut and applying his research to space travel. His registration was lost and his project never judged, but he was given an honorable mention out of a sense of fair play. At the fair, however, he learned that a Dr. James Bedford had been frozen in California. This was the beginning of Darwin's lifelong interest in cryonics. Career in cryonics Federowicz contacted the Cryonics Society of New York (CSNY) and got from them a considerable amount of literature by Saul Kent, who became a patron of Michael's rapidly growing cryonics technical skills. When he was 17, he got an invitation from Saul Kent to cryopreserve a cryonics patient for CSNY. Darwin had independently built his own cryonics equipment, which he found on his New York visit to be more sophisticated than that CSNY had actually used for cryopreservation. When he began his career as a dialysis technician, Michael adopted \\"Darwin\\" as his surname for his cryonics persona, so as not to endanger his career by the association with cryonics. Darwin and Stephen Bridge co-founded the Institute for Advanced Biological Studies (IABS) in Indianapolis in 1977, which merged with the then- California-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation in 1982. Darwin served as the President of Alcor, and then as the Research Director from 1988 to 1992, leaving Alcor in 1992. About 50 former Alcor members joined in the founding of the CryoCare Foundation, an organization dedicated to cryonics which later went defunct. Darwin founded a company, BioPreservation, which contracted perfusion and transport services to CryoCare. He is the author of such articles as ‚Ä≤History of DMSO and Glycerol in Cryonics‚Ä≤,http://www.alcor.org/Library/pdfs/Darwin_DMSO_glycerol.pdf ‚Ä≤How Dead is Dead Enough?‚Ä≤(2008), ‚Ä≤Cryonics: Why it has failed, and possible ways to fix it‚Ä≤(2008). Darwin is a vegetarian. His dog Mitzi is preserved at Alcor. Technical accomplishments Darwin was the first full-time cryonics researcher, for one year for Alcor in the 1970s. Darwin worked alongside UCLA cardiothoracic researcher Jerry Leaf during the 1980s, and physician Dr. Steven B. Harris in the 1990s to create many of the key technologies and practices of modern cryonics.

He was the 24th-most-successful German submarine commander of the war, credited with the having sunk (22 ships). After the war, he spent a year and a half as a British prisoner-of-war before starting a successful oil trading business and serving as a member of Bremen's city council (the B√ºrgerschaft) for over 32 years. World War II Hardegen served as 1.WO (First Watch Officer) under Kapit√§nleutnant Georg-Wilhelm Schulz aboard and, after two war patrols, was given his own command, the Type IID U-boat , operating out of Kiel, on 11 December 1940.Gannon, p.34 The boat was ready for its first patrol shortly before the new year and, after visiting the U-boat base in Bergen, U-147 was ordered to patrol the convoy routes north of the Hebrides. On the second day of the patrol, Hardegen fired a torpedo which failed to detonate against a large merchant ship, before being forced to submerge after mistaking a destroyer for a merchant ship. During the dive, the tower hatch was damaged, forcing U-147 to resurface after a short while to make feverish repairs only a few hundred meters from the destroyer. The gathering darkness, however, saved the boat from being detected.Gannon, p.36 The water leaks had damaged the diesel engines aboard the boat, forcing Hardegen to use his electric motors when, later in the night, he saw another merchant passing by. Although slowed, the U-boat had enough speed to close the distance and launch a torpedo which sank the freighter. After interrogating the crew, Hardegen learned it was the Norwegian steamer Augvald . A few days later, Hardegen again attacked two freighters, only to find his torpedoes missing or failing to detonate. Shortly thereafter, he was ordered back to Kiel. After completing the patrol, Hardegen was given command of , a Type IXB U-boat operating out of Lorient. Hardegen's first patrol with U-123 started on 16 June 1941, with a course for West African waters to attack British shipping around Freetown. On 20 June, Hardegen sank the neutral Portuguese vessel Ganda, mistaking her for a British freighter. D√∂nitz later ordered all references to this sinking deleted from the journals of U-123 and the matter received little attention.Gannon, p.52 This was one of two known alterations of the Kriegstagebuch ordered by D√∂nitz, the other being in regard to the sinking of the liner SS Athenia. His next patrol, in October 1941, took him to the North Atlantic. On 20 October he intercepted a convoy and attacked the British auxiliary cruiser (13,984 tons). Although badly damaged, the cruiser was towed to harbour for repairs. Some of the crew abandoned the cruiser, however, and Hardegen picked up a survivor who was brought back to France as a prisoner of war. This led Hardegen to claim the sinking.Gannon, p.58 First Drumbeat Patrol On 23 December 1941, U-123 left for the first phase of Operation Drumbeat. Five boats, which was all D√∂nitz could muster, were sent towards the American coast, to take advantage of the confusion in the Eastern Seaboard defense networks shortly after the declaration of war. Hardegen was ordered to penetrate the inshore areas around New York City, however due to the need for strict operational secrecy for this task, no mapping of the area was issued from stores in Lorient, and Hardegen had only large nautical charts as well as a Knaur pocket atlas (of his own), for navigation.A.Williams, The Battle of The Atlantic, page 164. After sinking the Cyclops and Norness, Hardegen decided to bottom (place the boat on the ocean bottom) the boat and wait for nightfall before proceeding into the harbour itself. During the night of 15 January, Hardegen entered the harbour, nearly beaching the boat when he mistook shorelight for a light ship.Gannon, p. 231 The crew of U-123 were elated when they came within the sight of the city itself, all lights burning brightly, but Hardegen did not linger long, due to the lack of merchant traffic. He did sink the British tanker Coimbra () on his way out.Gannon, p. 234 Hardegen then proceeded south along the coast, submerging during the day and surfacing at night. Apart from one air attack on 16 January, Hardegen did not experience any resistance from the United States Navy or United States Army Air Forces. During the night of 19 January, Hardegen sank three freighters off Cape Hatteras in shallow waters close to shore. A couple of hours later, he happened upon five more merchants traveling in a group and attacked them with his last two torpedoes and his 105 mm deck gun, sinking a freighter and claiming the tanker Malay () as well.Gannon, p. 263 Although badly damaged, Malay, traveling empty, had enough buoyancy to stay afloat and managed to make its way to New York under her own power five days later.Gannon, p. 265 U-123 at Lorient in February 1942. With all torpedoes expended, and the port diesel engine not functioning optimally, Hardegen decided to set course for home. Just before dawn, the Norwegian whaling factory Kosmos II () was spotted only away. The skipper of Kosmos, Einar Gleditsch, decided to ram U-123, ordering full speed ahead.Gannon, p. 276 Hardegen, realizing that the whaler was too close for him to submerge, turned hard to port and ordered full ahead. With its port engine unable to deliver top RPMs, U-123 only just managed to keep ahead of the tanker, and it took over an hour for Hardegen to gain enough of a lead to have room to maneuver.Gannon, p. 278 During the return journey, he spotted and sank the British freighter Culebra () on 25 January using the deck gun, but return fire from the freighter damaged the boat.Gannon, p. 286 The following night, the Norwegian tanker Pan Norway () was attacked and sunk. After the attack, Hardegen ordered a nearby neutral freighter to pick up the survivors, although he had to repeat his order after the Greek captain decided to steam off without picking up all of the crew.Gannon, p. 291 This sinking brought the tally for the first patrol to nine ships sunk for a total of over a two-week period, although Hardegen also claimed Malay for a total of .Gannon, p. 296 On 23 January, Hardegen received another signal, confirming he had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for sinking over of Allied shipping. He returned home to Lorient on 9 February and received a hero's welcome.Gannon, p. 304 Second Drumbeat patrol On 2 March 1942, Hardegen left for his final patrol, his second to American waters. The first successes were achieved when Hardegen sank the American tanker Muskogee () on 22 March and the British tanker Empire Steel () on 24 March. The latter attack expended four torpedoes, however, as one malfunctioned and one was fired without having been aimed.Gannon, p. 320 The tanker, carrying gasoline, burned fiercely for five hours before sinking and no survivors could be spotted. The somber crew of U-123 nicknamed the night the \\"Tanker Torch night\\".Gannon, p. 322 On 26 March, Hardegen attacked the American Q-ship (), mistaking it for a merchant freighter. After torpedoing the ship, Hardegen surfaced to sink her with the deck guns, only to find the Atik trying to ram him and opening fire on him with guns that had been concealed behind false bulwarks. Making a getaway on the surface, U-123 received eight hits and one of the crew members was fatally wounded. Approaching the Atik submerged, Hardegen sank her with another torpedo.Gannon, p. 326 Hardegen's second patrol was along the Florida coast. He reached the target area in late March, attacking the American tanker Liebre () on 1 April with his deck gun. Although the tanker was badly damaged, an approaching patrol craft forced Hardegen to submerge and leave the area. Liebre was towed to port and was ready to sail again by mid-July.Gannon, p. 334 On the night of 8 April, U-123 was positioned off the shore of St. Simons Island, Georgia and torpedoed and sank two tankers: the SS Oklahoma () and the Esso Baton Rouge (). The two tankers were sunk in such shallow water, however, that they were re-floated and put back into service.Gannon, p. 336 During the night of 9 April, U-123 sank the cold storage motor ship SS Esparta (). On the night of 11 April, U-123 torpedoed and sank the () about two miles off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. The Gulfamerica was on its maiden voyage from Philadelphia to Port Arthur, Texas with 90,000 barrels of fuel oil. After hitting her with a torpedo, Hardegen closed in for the kill with his deck gun. Noting the already large crowds gathering on the beach to watch the spectacle, as well as all the beach houses just beyond the Gulfamerica, Hardegen decided to manoeuver around the tanker and attack from the land side.Gannon, p. 363 The move was quite hazardous, as the U-boat was clearly illuminated to any onshore weapons, and the shallow waters forced it to take up station only from the tanker, which risked return fire from the tanker as well as getting caught in a blaze if the oil spilling out caught fire. The highways leading from Jacksonville were soon thronged with curious people trying to get to the beach to look at the spectacle.Gannon, p. 364 After firing for some time with the deck gun, the tanker was ablaze and Hardegen decided to leave. Already planes were overhead trying to locate the submarine by parachute lights, while a destroyer and several smaller patrol boats were closing in.Gannon, p. 367 Forced by an aircraft to crash dive, U-123 found itself on the bottom, only under the surface, when the destroyer, dropped six depth charges. Taking heavy damage and believing the destroyer would move in for another attack, Hardegen ordered the secret codes and machinery destroyed and the boat abandoned.Gannon, p. 368 As the commander, he was to open the tower hatch to allow the crew to escape using the escape gear; however, he was gripped by a paralyzing fear and was unable to proceed with the evacuation.Gannon, p. 372 Luckily for him, the Dahlgren, for reasons unknown, failed to drop any more depth charges and, after a short time, moved away, allowing the U-123 to complete emergency repairs and limp towards deeper waters. Hardegen would later tell Michael Gannon, \\"Only because I was too scared was I not captured.\\" On the night of 13 April, U-123 attacked the US freighter SS Leslie () with its last torpedo and Hardegen's fiftieth torpedo launch. It sank quickly just off Cape Canaveral.Gannon, p. 376 About two hours after this attack, Hardegen shelled the Swedish motor ship Korsholm () under British charter, and sank her within twenty minutes. He did, however, mistake the freighter for a tanker.Gannon, p. 377 At this point in his second patrol, Hardegen claimed ten ships for a total of , whereas in reality he had sunk nine, if counting the two tankers later refloated, for a total of a still respectable . To sum up his patrol, Hardegen chose the lyrical approach, sending the following signal to BdU: > Sieben Tankern schlug die letze Stund, > die U-Falle sank tr√§ger. > Zwei Frachter liegen mit auf Grund, > Versenkt vom Paukenschl√§ger. > (For seven tankers the last hour has passed > the U-boat Trap sank slower. > Two freighters lie on the bottom too, > sunk by the drum-beater.) Setting course for home, Hardegen sighted the freighter SS Alcoa Guide () on 16 April and sank her with fire from the 105mm deck gun, as well as the 37mm and 20mm flak guns.Gannon, p. 400 On 23 April, Hardegen received a signal confirming his award of the Oak Leaves to his Knights Cross. On 2 May, U-123 docked at Lorient, ending Hardegen's career as an active U-boat commander, although he commanded the boat for a final journey, bringing her back to Kiel for some necessary repairs in May 1942. Hardegen was not enamored with the Nazi regime; he openly disagreed with Nazi politics. He also, as U-Boat historian Michael Gannon documents meticulously with accounts from survivors, furnished food and navigational directions to the lifeboats of torpedoed merchantmen when possible and, in at least one case, forcibly halted a neutral ship to have it pick up survivors of a vessel he had sunk nearby. He was also credited with saving Norwegian war sailors and others from death at sea.https://www.norwegianamerican.com/featured/a-tale-of-two-mariners-on-the- mercy-of-some-u-boat-captains/ Hardegen said that when he met Adolf Hitler and was awarded the Knight's Cross by him, he thought \\"then that he was a nice fellow. That was a big mistake\\".https://www.pressreader.com/south- africa/daily-news/20130319/281492158759464 By 1942, Hardegen and his crew had realized that Hitler was a madman who was wreaking havoc and driving Germany towards catastrophe. One time, he and fellow Oak Leaves winner Erich Topp were invited to a dinner with Hitler. Hardegen claimed to have caused great embarrassment by arguing during the meal that the U-boat war was under- resourced and that Hitler was neglecting of naval priorities and was obsessed with the land war in the East. In his account, this infuriated Hitler and caused Hardegen to receive a reprimand from Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl, to which Hardegen replied, \\"The F√ºhrer has a right to hear the truth, and I have a duty to speak it.\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/08/21/the-submerged- story-of-the-u-boat-war/fe21e713-3be7-42dd-8626-6eb6bbff6559/ Shore duty On 31 July 1942, Hardegen relinquished command of U-123 and took up duties as an instructor in the 27th U-boat Training Flotilla in Gotenhafen. In March 1943, Kapit√§nleutnant Hardegen became chief of U-boat training of the torpedo school at Marineschule M√ºrwik, before taking up a position in the Torpedowaffenamt (torpedo weapon department), where he oversaw testing and development of new acoustic and wired torpedoes.Gannon, p. 408 In his last posting, he served as battalion commander in Marine Infanterie Regiment 6 from February 1945 until the end of the war. The unit took part in fierce fighting against the British in the area around Bremen, and most of the officers were killed. Hardegen stated that his survival was due to his being hospitalized with a severe case of diphtheria.Gannon, p. 409 For the last few days of the war, Hardegen served on D√∂nitz's staff in Flensburg, where he was arrested by British troops. Later life Reinhard Hardegen, 2016, at the age of 103 After the war, Hardegen was mistaken for a SS officer with the same last name, and it took him a year and a half to assemble the evidence to convince the Allied interrogators of his real identity. He returned home in November 1946, where he started as a businessman, first on a bike and then in a car. In 1952, he started an oil trading company, which he built up into a great success. Hardegen also served as a member of Parliament (B√ºrgerschaft of Bremen) for the Christian Democrats in his hometown of Bremen for 32 years. He went into the heating oil business‚Äîrepresenting, among others, Texaco, whose ships he had sunk. He visited the United States many times, conversing with survivors and veterans regularly, amongst them, men who had tried to kill him during his U-boat service and made friends with them.https://legionmagazine.com/en/2018/07/reinhard-hardegen-last-of-the-u- boat-aces/ In 2012, he was honoured by the modern military in Germany for his wartime service. He turned 100 in March 2013 in very good health, winning golf trophies and still driving a car. Hardegen survived the war, and returned to Jacksonville in 1990, where he was received as an honoured guest. He would say of the occasion that \\"The town was very friendly to me.\\"http://www.usmm.org/closetohome.html He died on 9 June 2018 at the age of 105.http://www.bremische-buergerschaft.de/?noMobile=1 Awards * Wehrmacht Long Service Award 4th Class (1 April 1937)Busch & R√∂ll 2003, p. 187. * Eisernes Kreuz (1939) ** 2nd Class (18 September 1940)Thomas 1997, p. 244. ** 1st Class (23 August 1941) * Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ** Ritterkreuz on 23 January 1942 as Kapit√§nleutnant and commander of U-123Fellgiebel 2000, p. 213. ** 89th Eichenlaub on 23 April 1942 as Kapit√§nleutnant and commander of U-123Fellgiebel 2000, p. 59. * U-boat War Badge (1939) (18 November 1940) ** with Diamonds (7 May 1942) * War Merit Cross 2nd Class (20 April 1944) References=NotesBibliography  Gannon, Michael (1991).

Its genus includes the lesser adjutant of Asia and the marabou stork of Africa. Once found widely across southern Asia, mainly in India but extending east to Borneo, the greater adjutant is now restricted to a much smaller range with only three breeding populations; two in India, with the largest colony in Assam, a smaller one around Bhagalpur; and another breeding population in Cambodia. They disperse widely after the breeding season. This large stork has a massive wedge-shaped bill, a bare head and a distinctive neck pouch. During the day, it soars in thermals along with vultures with whom it shares the habit of scavenging. They feed mainly on carrion and offal; however, they are opportunistic and will sometimes prey on vertebrates. The English name is derived from their stiff \\"military\\" gait when walking on the ground. Large numbers once lived in Asia, but they have declined (possibly due to improved sanitation) to the point of endangerment. The total population in 2008 was estimated at around a thousand individuals. In the 19th century, they were especially common in the city of Calcutta, where they were referred to as the \\"Calcutta adjutant\\" and included in the coat of arms for the city. Known locally as hargila (derived from the Bengali words for \\"bone-swallower\\") and considered to be unclean birds, they were largely left undisturbed but sometimes hunted for the use of their meat in folk medicine. Valued as scavengers, they were once depicted in the logo of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Description Greater adjutant in water (Kaziranga, Assam) The greater adjutant is a huge bird, standing tall at . The average length is and average wingspan is . While no weights have been published for wild birds, the greater adjutant is among the largest of living storks, with published measurements overlapping with those of the jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), saddle- billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis) and marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus). Juvenile greater adjutant storks in captivity weighed from . For comparison, the heaviest known wild stork was a marabou stork scaling .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . The huge bill, which averages long, is wedge-like and is pale grey with a darker base. The wing chord averages , the tail and the tarsus in length. With the exception of the tarsus length, the standard measurements of the greater adjutant are on average greater than that of other stork species. A white collar ruff at the base of its bare yellow to red-skinned neck gives it a vulture-like appearance. In the breeding season, the pouch and neck become bright orange and the upper thighs of the grey legs turn reddish. Adults have a dark wing that contrasts with light grey secondary coverts. The underside of the body is whitish and the sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Juveniles are a duller version of the adult. The pendant inflatable pouch connects to the air passages and is not connected to the digestive tract. The exact function is unknown, but it is not involved in food storage as was sometimes believed. This was established in 1825 by Dr. John Adam, a student of Professor Robert Jameson, who dissected a specimen and found the two-layered pouch filled mainly with air. The only possible confusable species in the region is the smaller lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), which lacks a pouch, prefers wetland habitats, has a lighter grey skull cap, a straighter edge to the upper mandible, and lacks the contrast between the grey secondary coverts and the dark wings. Like others storks, it lacks intrinsic muscles in the syrinx and produces sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering display is made with the bill raised high and differs from that of the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards. Taxonomy and systematics \\"Gigantic Crane\\" from Latham's General Synopsis of Birds (1781‚Äì1801) John Latham wrote about the bird found in Calcutta based on descriptions in Ives's Voyage to India published in 1773 and included an illustration in the first supplement to his General Synopsis of Birds. The illustration was based on a drawing in Lady Impey's collection. Latham called it the \\"gigantic crane\\", and included observations by an African traveller named Smeathman who described a similar bird from western Africa. Johann Friedrich Gmelin used Latham's description and described the Indian bird as Ardea dubia in 1789 while Latham later used the name Ardea argala for the Indian bird. Temminck used the name Ciconia marabou in 1824 based on the local name used in Senegal for the African bird and this was also applied to the Indian species. This led to considerable confusion between the African and Indian species. The marabou stork of Africa looks somewhat similar but their disjunct distribution ranges, differences in bill structure, plumage, and display behaviour support their treatment as separate species. Most storks fly with their neck outstretched, but the three Leptoptilos species retract their neck in flight as herons do, possibly due to the heavy bill. When walking on the ground, it has a stiff marching gait from which the name \\"adjutant\\" is derived. Distribution This species was once a widespread winter visitor in the riverine plains of northern India. However, their breeding areas were largely unknown for a long time until a very large nesting colony was finally discovered in 1877 at Shwaygheen on the Sittaung River, Pegu, Burma. It was believed that the Indian birds bred there. This breeding colony, which also included spot-billed pelicans (Pelecanus philippensis), declined in size and entirely vanished by the 1930s. Subsequently, a nest site in Kaziranga was the only known breeding area until new sites were discovered in Assam, the Tonle Sap lake and in the Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary. In 1989, the breeding population in Assam was estimated at about 115 birds, and between 1994 and 1996 the population in the Brahmaputra valley was considered to be about 600. A small colony with about 35 nests was discovered near Bhagalpur in 2006. The number increased to 75 nests in 2014. Fossil evidence suggests that the species possibly (since there were several other species in the genus that are now extinct) occurred in northern Vietnam around 6000 years ago. Photographic study of the \\"martial\\" gait by Eadweard Muybridge (circa 1887)] ]During the non-breeding season, storks in the Indian region disperse widely, mainly in the Gangetic Plains. Sightings from the Deccan region are rare. Records of flocks from further south, near Mahabalipuram, have been questioned. In the 1800s, adjutant storks were extremely common within the city of Calcutta during the summer and rainy season. These aggregations along the Ghats of Calcutta, however, declined and vanished altogether by the early 1900s. Improved sanitation has been suggested as a cause of their decline. Birds were recorded in Bangladesh in the 1850s, breeding somewhere in the Sundarbans, but have not been recorded subsequently. Behaviour and ecology The greater adjutant is usually seen singly or in small groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is often found in the company of kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings. Breeding Greater adjutant stork in breeding plumage, perched near nest (Assam) The greater adjutant breeds during winter in colonies that may include other large waterbirds such as the spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed at the end of a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks near the center of a tree, allowing the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days, each taking about 35 days from the date of laying. Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.An 1855 illustration depicting the stork hunting a snake Feeding The greater adjutant is omnivorous and although mainly a scavenger, it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds, reptiles and rodents. It has been known to attack wild ducks within reach and swallowing them whole. Their main diet however is carrion, and like the vultures their bare head and neck is an adaptation. They are often found on garbage dumps and will feed on animal and human excreta. In 19th-century Calcutta, they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river. In Rajasthan, where it is extremely rare, it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but this has been questioned. Parasites, diseases and mortality At least two species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only recorded causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution such as when the birds accidentally fly into telephone lines. Captive birds have been found to be susceptible to avian influenza, (H5N1) and a high mortality rate was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years. Status and conservation Engraving showing adjutants at the cremation ghat in Calcutta, c. 1877 Loss of nesting and feeding habitat through the draining of wetlands, pollution and other disturbances, together with hunting and egg collection in the past has caused a massive decline in the population of this species. The world population was estimated at less than 1,000 individuals in 2008. The greater adjutant is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 188x188px Conservation measures have included attempts to breed them in captivity and to reduce fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites. Nearly 15% of the chicks are killed when they fall off the nests and die of starvation, so some conservationists have used nets positioned below the nests to prevent injuries to falling young. These fallen birds are then fed and raised in enclosures for about five months and then released to join their wild siblings. In Kamrup district, Assam, which is home to one of the few large colonies of greater adjutants, outreach efforts including cultural and religious programming, especially aimed at village women, have rallied residents to conserve the birds. The locals, who formerly regarded the birds as pests, now see the storks as special and take pride in protecting them and the trees in which they breed. Locals have even added prayers for the safety of the storks to hymns, and included stork designs to the motifs used in traditional weaving. Similar measures have been used with success in other parts of India where adjutants breed. In culture Science is Measurement (1879) by Henry Stacy Marks Aelian described the bird in 250 AD in his De Natura Animalium as the kilas (Œ∫Œ∑ŒªŒ±œÇ), a large bird from India with a crop that looks like a leather bag. Babur described it in his memoirs under the name of ding. In Victorian times the greater adjutant was known as the gigantic crane and later as the Asiatic marabou. It was very common in Calcutta during the rainy season and large numbers could be seen at garbage sites and also standing on the top of buildings. In Bihar, the bird is associated with the mythical bird garuda. Its name hargila in Bengal and Assam is said to be derived from the Sanskrit roots had for \\"bone\\" and gila - \\"to swallow\\"- and describes the bird as a \\"bone swallower\\". John Latham used the Latinized form as the species epithet in the binomial name, Ardea argala. At that time it was believed that the birds were protected by the souls of dead Brahmins. Young British soldiers were known to harass these birds for fun, even blowing up birds by feeding them meat containing bones packed with a cartridge and fuse. The birds would remain calm when natives passed by but would bark in alarm at those in European clothes. The birds in Calcutta were considered to be efficient scavengers and an act was passed to protect them. Anyone who injured or killed a bird had to pay a hefty fine of fifty rupees. The coat of arms of the city of Calcutta issued through two patents on 26 December 1896 included two adjutant birds with serpents in their beaks and charged on their shoulder with an Eastern Crown as supporters. The motto read \\"Per ardua stabilis esto\\", Latin for \\"steadfast through trouble\\". The arms were included in the logo of official bodies such as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Scottish regiment. Captured birds, probably from Calcutta, reached menageries in Europe during this period. A view of Calcutta in 1819 by R. Havell, Jr. based on James Baillie Fraser showing a number of greater adjutants standing on the buildings The undertail covert feathers taken from adjutant were exported to London during the height of the plume trade under the name of Commercolly (or Kumarkhali, now in Bangladesh) or \\"marabout\\". Since the birds were protected by law, plume collectors would ambush the birds roosting atop buildings, grabbing their undertail feathers which would come off when the birds took to flight. Along with egret plumes, these were the most valuable of feather exports. Specimens of tippets, victorines and boas made from these feathers were displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851. An Indian myth recorded by the Moghul emperor Babur was that a magic \\"snake-stone\\" existed inside the skull of the bird, being an antidote for all snake venoms and poisons. This \\"stone\\" was supposed to be extremely rare as it could only be obtained by a hunter with great skill, for the bird had to be killed without letting its bill touch the ground since that would make the \\"stone\\" evaporate instantly. Folk- medicine practitioners believed that a piece of stork flesh chewed daily with betel could cure leprosy. The English artist Henry Stacy Marks (1829-1888) took a special interest in birds. Many of his paintings were based on birds in the London Zoo with several depicting greater adjutants including Convocation (1878), Science is Measurement (1879), Half hours at the Zoo, and An Episcopal Visitation.

Some credit the yips to a loss of fine motor skills; others consider the condition to be primarily psychological. However, it is poorly understood and has no known treatment or therapy. Athletes affected by the yips sometimes recover their ability, which may require a change in technique. Many are forced to abandon their sport at the highest level. Originally coined by golfer Tommy Armour to describe a sudden and inexplicable loss of the ability to putt correctly, the term has later been broadened to apply to any unexplained loss of skill, and has been applied to athletes in a wide variety of sports. In golf In golf, the yips is a movement disorder known to interfere with putting. The term yips is said to have been popularized by Tommy Armour‚Äîa golf champion and later golf teacher‚Äîto explain the difficulties that led him to abandon tournament play.Barkow, A. and Barrett, D. (1997) Golf Legends of All Time. Publications International. In describing the yips, golfers have used terms such as twitches, staggers, jitters and jerks. The yips affects between a quarter and a half of all mature golfers.Smith et al., 2000. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic found that 33% to 48% of all serious golfers have experienced the yips. Golfers who have played for more than 25 years appear most prone to the condition. Although the exact cause of the yips has yet to be determined, one possibility is biochemical changes in the brain that accompany aging. Excessive use of the involved muscles and intense demands of coordination and concentration may exacerbate the problem. Giving up golf for a month sometimes helps. Focal dystonia has been mentioned as another possibility for the cause of yips.Farias J. Intertwined. How to induce neuroplasticity. A new approach to rehabilitating dystonias. Galene Editions, 2012. Professional golfers seriously afflicted by the yips include P√°draig Harrington, Bernhard Langer, Ben Hogan, Harry Vardon, Sam Snead, Ian Baker-Finch and Keegan Bradley, who missed a six-inch putt in the final round of the 2013 HP Byron Nelson Championship due to the condition (although he may also have been suffering from strabismus). At the 2015 Waste Management Open, golf analyst Nick Faldo suggested that Tiger Woods could be suffering from the yips. Jay Yarow from Business Insider commented after the 2014 Open that Woods had both the putting yips and the driver yips. Interventions seeking to treat the affliction have been few and far between. Some golfers have tried changing their putter or their grip or even switching hands. However, these strategies have provided only temporary relief. In cricket In cricket, the yips applies mostly to bowlers and seems predominantly to affect left-arm spinners. The affliction seems to involve bowlers having trouble releasing the ball at the end of their action. An example of this was Keith Medlycott, who having reached the England squad was forced to abandon the sport. Another player, Gavin Hamilton, having played a Test as an all-rounder, largely abandoned his right-arm medium pace bowling, following the yips. He did not make another Test appearance, but has enjoyed a One Day International career for Scotland, predominantly as a specialist batsman. Collins Obuya was one of the stars of Kenya's 2003 World Cup‚Äîhe gained a contract with Warwickshire on the back of it‚Äîbut soon afterward his game fell apart when he developed the yips. England cricket team sports psychologist Dr Mark Bawden suffered from the yips himself as a teenager. He completed a PhD on the topic and has published a paper on the yips in the Journal of Sports Science. In baseball In baseball, the yips usually manifests itself as a sudden inability to throw the baseball accurately. Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Steve Blass is an example; from 1964 to 1972, he was a dominant pitcher and All-Star; however, beginning in 1973, he suddenly lost his command, issuing 84 walks in innings pitched. He retired in 1974 due to continued loss of his pitching ability. \\"Steve Blass disease\\" has been attributed to talented players‚Äîsuch as New York Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch or Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Steve Sax‚Äîwho also inexplicably seemed to lose their ability to throw the ball accurately. New York Mets catcher Mackey Sasser suffered the yips; he sometimes could not throw the ball back to the pitcher without tapping his mitt several times‚ÄîSan Francisco Giants outfielder Brett Butler once stole third base during a Sasser yip. Sasser's problem became worse after a 1990 collision at home plate with Jim Presley of the Atlanta Braves, leading to a decrease in Sasser's playing time, and his release from the Seattle Mariners in 1994. Mark Wohlers of the Atlanta Braves was called \\"the 1990s poster child for Steve Blass Syndrome.\\" Jon Lester is also said to have suffered the yips on his pickoff move to first. He did not throw to first at all in 2014, and struggled to make accurate throws early in 2015. Pittsburgh Pirates minor league pitching prospect Hayden Hurst was so badly affected by the yips that he left baseball and went to the University of South Carolina to play football instead. On April 26, 2018, he was drafted in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft, 25th overall, by the Baltimore Ravens. ESPN featured a story about Luke Hagerty's comeback from the yips in 2019. He never played after being drafted #32 overall by the Chicago Cubs in the 2002 draft. In other sports The yips also affects players in other sports. Examples include Markelle Fultz and Chuck Hayes' respective free throw shots in basketball and Guillermo Coria and Elena Dementieva struggling with serving in tennis. In darts, the yips are known as dartitis, with five-time world champion Eric Bristow an example of a sufferer. In the National Football League (NFL), a normally reliable placekicker who starts struggling is also said to have the yips. Stephen Hendry, seven times snooker World Champion, said after his loss to Mark Williams in the 2011 UK Championship that he had been suffering from the yips for ten years, and that the condition had affected his ability to cue through the ball, causing him great difficulty in regaining his old form.

Al-Zulfiqar was formed to avenge Bhutto's killing by means of armed struggle against the military regime of General Zia-ul-Haq. Zia had deposed the Bhutto regime after mass protests across Pakistan that were related to the dissatisfaction of the masses with the rule of Bhutto (mismanagement of East Pakistan, alleged links of Bhutto to political murders, corruption, economic stagnation as a result of nationalization, deteriorating education system, etc.) in a Military coup in July 1977. Bhutto was hanged by the Zia regime. Bhutto's two sons, Murtaza Bhutto and Shahnawaz Bhutto went into exile in Afghanistan which was then being ruled by a Soviet-backed communist government. There the two sons formed the Al-Zulfiqar along with hundreds of Pakistan Peoples Party militants who had escaped Zia's persecution. PIA hijacking The hijacking went on for thirteen days in which Lieutenant Tariq Rahim was shot, the hijackers mistakenly believing he was the son of General Rahimuddin Khan, the martial law administrator of Balochistan. This forced the Zia regime to accept the demands of the hijackers of releasing dozens of Pakistan Peoples Party and other leftist political prisoners languishing in Pakistani jails. The hijacking was condemned by Bhutto's daughter, Benazir Bhutto, who was under house arrest in Pakistan and leading a political movement against the Zia dictatorship. The Al-Zulfiqar also attempted to assassinate Zia on a number of occasions and it tried to bomb a vigil Karachi held in honour of Pope John Paul II who was visiting Pakistan in 1980. Cracks started to appear in Al- Zulfiqar after Murtaza Bhutto and one of his most trusted aides, Raja Anwar, developed differences. Raja wanted to return to Pakistan and help Benazir Bhutto in her political struggle against the Zia dictatorship. Murtaza asked his main hit man, Salamullah Tipu, to assassinate Raja and his supporters. Tipu was a former leftist student leader who had joined Al-Zulfiqar in 1980. Raja was thrown into a Kabul jail on Murtaza's request and eventually so was Tipu when in 1984 his wild antics became a security threat to Kabul and Murtaza. Murtaza folded the organization's operations in Kabul when his younger brother, Shahnawaz Bhutto, died suddenly in Paris in 1985, allegedly from poisoning. Both Benazir and Murtaza insisted that he was poisoned by his young Afghan wife who had become an agent of the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI. Murtaza eventually moved to Syria and continued low-key Al- Zulfiqar operations from there.

Wilinson, Edward H. Dawvidson, Alexander Foulkes and Ahmad R. Mafi Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 8thEdition Oxford University Press 2010 The two steps of shifting dullness. Percussion of the green section shifts from a dull note to a tympanic note after the patient changes from supine to lateral decubitus position. The test is performed by first percussing the midline of the abdomen to elicit a resonant note due to gas in the abdomen. If there is no area of resonance, then the test cannot be performed. Percussion is then moved progressively more laterally (away from the examiner) ‚Äì this is depicted as the red section in the diagram on the right ‚Äì until the note becomes dull, as depicted by the green section. The examiner's index finger remains on the resonant side, and the middle finger remains on the dull side, straddling the fluid-air level. The patient is then asked to lean on their right lateral side (assuming the examiner used the traditional right-sided approach). This stabilises the patient by positioning them between the examiner's hands and body. It is imperative that the examiner's fingers stay in the same position. After waiting sufficient time for any fluid to shift (up to 30 seconds), the dull position is then percussed. It may now be resonant. The percussion may now be performed down the anterior side until a new dullness is found. To confirm a positive result it is recommended that the now resonant area become dull again when the patient is back in the supine position. If the borders between tympanitic (resonant) and dull notes remain the same, the person probably does not have ascites, or has less than 2 litres of free fluid present. If the fluid causing the dullness was not free, then the air-fluid level would not move. Shifting dullness is usually present if the volume of ascitic fluid is greater than 1500 ml. If low volume ascites is suspected, then an attempt to elicit the puddle sign may be performed. In some cases, the ascites collide to form a bigger ascites. This creates a different kind of shifting dullness.

The Schenley High School building was closed in June 2008 in a 5-4 vote by the school district due to issues with asbestos. Its staff and students were relocated the following year. The Schenley name was retired and its last class graduated in 2011. On February 28, 2013 the Pittsburgh School Board approved the sale of Schenley High School to the PMC Property Group of Philadelphia in a 5-4 vote. The Schenley building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP Reference #86002706). and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Register. It is also a contributing property in the Schenley Farms Historic District. History Schenley High School was named for Pittsburgh philanthropist Mary Schenley, on whose land the school was built. It was designed by Edward Stotz as a triangle and constructed of Indiana limestone, the best of its kind. Schenley was the first high school in the United States to cost more than one million dollars to build. When Schenley opened in 1916, there were 1800 students and 70 teachers. Through public donation a Skinner Pipe Organ was donated to the school, the organ remained in the auditorium until the closing of the school. The school published \\"The Triangle,\\" a monthly student newspaper founded in 1919 and named for the building's original shape. The school's highest enrollment was 3012 in March 1940. Schenley sports teams won many city and state championships, including several state basketball titles in the 1970s. In 1983, the school was rededicated as the Schenley High School Teacher Center, an innovative program in which all of the district's teachers would cycle through Schenley to update methods. The program would be deemed successful enough to warrant a visit from then United States Secretary of Education William Bennet. In 1987, a new wing was added to the building. Relocation and Closure In June 2008, due to severe maintenance problems, school district Superintendent Mark Roosevelt proposed to close Schenley High School to avoid an extremely high renovation bill. This led to public opposition by students and historical organizations that felt the building was worth saving. After months of debate the school board voted 5-4 to close the school following the 2007-2008 school year. The staff and students were moved to the Reizenstein Middle School building, which had been closed a few years earlier. Freshmen, sophomores and juniors who were enrolled in Schenley at the time of its closure were allowed to graduate as Schenley students. Schenley's final class graduated on June 12, 2011. For future classes, Schenley was renamed to Obama Academy, and the Reizenstein building became a shared space for the two Schools from 2009-2011. Obama Academy, which found a permanent home in the former Peabody high school building beginning in the 2012-2013 school year, preserved much of Schenley's teaching staff throughout the transition, as well as the IB academic curriculum and award- winning musical theater program. Protests to save the original Schenley High building ultimately failed on February 27, 2013 when the Pittsburgh Public Schools board voted to 5-4 to sell the building to a developer who would convert the former school into luxury apartments. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl The Summer of 2014 saw the Schenley High School building play a starring role in the film Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. The film, based on the 2013 book written by Schenley graduate Jesse Andrews, tells the tale of a Schenley senior who is dealing with coming of age while facing the possibility of losing a sick classmate. For the movie scenes were filmed throughout Schenley High School, including the auditorium and cafeteria. The school colors in the film, however, were changed from red and black to blue and gold. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, where it broke records. Distributor Fox Searchlight purchased the rights to the film for an estimated 12 million dollars.

The laws were established by the Massachusetts General Court in 1641. The Body of Liberties begins by establishing the exclusive right of the General Court to legislate and dictate the \\"Countenance of Authority\\". In 1684, King Charles II revoked the Body of Liberties and reinstated English law over the Commonwealth. King James II established the Massachusetts Colony, and the Body of Liberties took effect and remained so until it was replaced by the 1691 Provincial Charter.Encyclopedia of American civil liberties, Volume 1, Ed. Paul Finkelman, entry written by Sherrow Pinder, CRC Press, 2006, , page 979. Though towns such as Dedham and Watertown had already established them, the Body of Liberties recognized boards of selectmen for the first time. Rights acknowledged by the Body of Liberties The Body of Liberties was one of the earliest protections of individual rights in America.Bernard Schwartz, The great rights of mankind: a history of the American Bill of Rights, Rowman & Littlefield, 1992, 0945612281, page 51. Unlike many of the English sources of the time, the Body of Liberties were express in many of their grants and far more supportive of individual rights. Despite these grants, the rights were modifiable by the General Court. To varying degrees, the document contained rights that would later be included in the Bill of Rights. Many of the other rights are now considered fundamental components of procedural due process, such as rights to notice and hearing before the court. The rights also contained in the Bill of Rights included freedom of speech, a right against uncompensated takings, a right to bail, a right to jury trial, a right against cruel and unusual punishment, and a right against double jeopardy. In addition to those, the Body of Liberties also contained other individual rights, including: a prohibition of a compulsory draft except for territorial defense; a prohibition of monopolies, \\"No monopolies shall be granted or allowed amongst us, but of such new Inventions that are profitable to the Countrie, and that for a short time.\\"; prohibition of an estate tax; the freedom of all \\"house holders\\" to fishing and fowling on public land; and a declaration that a married woman should be \\"free from bodilie correction or stripes by her husband.\\"The Massachusetts Body of Liberties (1641) at Hanover Historical Texts Project. The Body of Liberties also contained regulations against ‚ÄúTirranny or Crueltie‚Äù toward domestic animals, which were the first American modern animal protection laws. Slavery Some of the liberties legislated are explicitly cited as originating from biblical sources. While many of the liberties established still exist in both and law and practice in the Commonwealth today, some do not. The justification for slavery of Africans in Passage 91 of the Body of Liberties was likely based on an interpretation of scriptural passages of the New Testament, such as Ephesians 6:5 and Titus 2:9. Liberties were only extended to Caucasian Northern Europeans, mainly Protestant Christian men. Native Americans taken prisoner during wars were shipped to the West Indies, there to be slaves on the sugar cane plantations. Returning ships brought African born and descended slaves to New England.Gallay, Alan. (2002) The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South 1670‚Äì1717.

He immigrated to America in 1886 at age 23; he settled in Illinois and became involved in the nascent denomination in the States. Though his educational background was pre-med, he accepted an offer from E. August Skogsbergh (1850-1939) offer to teach at his school in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1887 he married Skogsbergh's sister Louise and served a year as pastor to a church in Sioux City, Iowa. David Nyvall (Evangelical Covenant Church) Career The next year he began teaching in the Swedish department of the Chicago Theological Seminary, which at the time provided the theological education of many Covenant pastors. Nyvall felt strongly that the Covenant should have its own school. Acting on this conviction, he resigned from the Chicago Theological Seminary and returned to Skogsbergh's Minneapolis school, which the Covenant had recently accepted as the denomination's school. Three years later this school was moved to Chicago and North Park College was established, a decision that upset some, including Nyvall's brother-in-law, Skogsbergh. North Park Nyvall served as president of North Park and professor of New Testament in the Seminary. Under his leadership and guidance, the school survived struggles and grew in both enrollment and endowment. Largely as a result of criticism and disagreement about the infamous Gold money, Nyvall resigned as president and professor in 1904 and left the school the following year. 1905‚Äì1912 In his absence, he served as the first president of Walden College in McPherson, Kansas. In 1907 he returned to Sweden and the following year he took up residence in Minneapolis where he edited the early Covenant periodical Veckoblad. He also established the department of Scandinavian Studies at the University of Washington and served as professor from 1910 until 1912. Nyvall hall of North Park university Return to North Park In January 1912, Nyvall accepted to Covenant's call to resume his position at North Park, and returned as president of the school, a position he held until 1923. After 1923, Nyvall continued to serve North Park and the Covenant by acting as dean of the Seminary and teacher until 1941. Legacy The main seminary building, Nyvall hall, bears his name. His understanding of Christian education, specifically Covenant Education, is still normative and formative at North Park University. The David Nyvall lecture series was inaugurated in 1951 in memory of the pioneer Swedish American educator who served the school both as teacher and president.

The company expanded into theatrical film distribution in the early '90s as REP (standing for Richard Entertainment Partners after Russell Becker's son Richard and his two friends Richard Sheffield and Richard Guardian who collaborated with him on the move into film. Richard Sheffield ran REP as a Becker employee until he left to establish the Australian office of PolyGram Pictures). The Australian box office success of Four Weddings and a Funeral fueled the listing of Becker Entertainment Limited on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1995, with Richard Becker as Managing Director and Russell as Chairman. Subsequently, Becker Entertainment purchased the Dendy Cinema chain and became Australia's largest exhibitor of art house or limited release theatrical films. The value of the Dendy brand, which Becker enhanced with new cinema construction, lead to the renaming of the theatrical distribution department to Dendy Distribution. Prior to the sale of Becker Entertainment to Prime Television in 2007, these two divisions were sold to Mel Gibson and Bruce Davey's Icon Productions. After stepping down from Becker Entertainment in 2007, Richard Becker went on to establish a new company, Becker Film Group in 2008 With the remaining assets owned by Prime Television Limited, the company was eventually delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange, and remaining rights absorbed into Prime Television Limited. Prime went on to rename the company WASTAR ENTERTAINMENT PTY LTD ACN 073 853 371 and would eventually deregister the company 9 June 2013. New Beginning On 22 September 2016, Daniel Becker and RJ Brent successfully lobbied ASIC to register a new trading entity of Becker Entertainment Pty Ltd ACN 614 954 157 This company was established as a Film and TV Production Company, and started focusing on projects in 2017 with My Day Job and Ravenswood.

It links the properties of elementary particles to the structure of Lie groups and Lie algebras. According to this connection, the different quantum states of an elementary particle give rise to an irreducible representation of the Poincar√© group. Moreover, the properties of the various particles, including their spectra, can be related to representations of Lie algebras, corresponding to \\"approximate symmetries\\" of the universe.  General picture =Symmetries of a quantum system In quantum mechanics, any particular one-particle state is represented as a vector in a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal H. To help understand what types of particles can exist, it is important to classify the possibilities for \\\\mathcal H allowed by symmetries, and their properties. Let \\\\mathcal H be a Hilbert space describing a particular quantum system and let G be a group of symmetries of the quantum system. In a relativistic quantum system, for example, G might be the Poincar√© group, while for the hydrogen atom, G might be the rotation group SO(3). The particle state is more precisely characterized by the associated projective Hilbert space \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H, also called ray space, since two vectors that differ by a nonzero scalar factor correspond to the same physical quantum state represented by a ray in Hilbert space, which is an equivalence class in \\\\mathcal H and, under the natural projection map \\\\mathcal H \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm P \\\\mathcal H, an element of \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H. By definition of a symmetry of a quantum system, there is a group action on \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H. For each g\\\\in G, there is a corresponding transformation V(g) of \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H. More specifically, if g is some symmetry of the system (say, rotation about the x-axis by 12¬∞), then the corresponding transformation V(g) of \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H is a map on ray space. For example, when rotating a stationary (zero momentum) spin-5 particle about its center, g is a rotation in 3D space (an element of \\\\mathrm{SO(3)}), while V(g) is an operator whose domain and range are each the space of possible quantum states of this particle, in this example the projective space \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H associated with an 11-dimensional complex Hilbert space \\\\mathcal H. Each map V(g) preserves, by definition of symmetry, the ray product on \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H induced by the inner product on \\\\mathcal H; according to Wigner's theorem, this transformation of \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H comes from a unitary or anti-unitary transformation U(g) of \\\\mathcal H. Note, however, that the U(g) associated to a given V(g) is not unique, but only unique up to a phase factor. The composition of the operators U(g) should, therefore, reflect the composition law in G, but only up to a phase factor: :U(gh)=e^{i\\\\theta}U(g)U(h), where \\\\theta will depend on g and h. Thus, the map sending g to U(g) is a projective unitary representation of G, or possibly a mixture of unitary and anti-unitary, if G is disconnected. In practice, anti-unitary operators are always associated with time-reversal symmetry. Ordinary versus projective representations It is important physically that in general U(\\\\cdot) does not have to be an ordinary representation of G; it may not be possible to choose the phase factors in the definition of U(g) to eliminate the phase factors in their composition law. An electron, for example, is a spin-one-half particle; its Hilbert space consists of wave functions on \\\\mathbb{R}^3 with values in a two-dimensional spinor space. The action of \\\\mathrm{SO(3)} on the spinor space is only projective: It does not come from an ordinary representation of \\\\mathrm{SO(3)}. There is, however, an associated ordinary representation of the universal cover \\\\mathrm{SU(2)} of \\\\mathrm{SO(3)} on spinor space. Section 4.7 For many interesting classes of groups G, Bargmann's theorem tells us that every projective unitary representation of G comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover \\\\tilde{G} of G. Actually, if \\\\mathcal H is finite dimensional, then regardless of the group G, every projective unitary representation of G comes from an ordinary unitary representation of \\\\tilde{G}. Theorem 16.47 If \\\\mathcal H is infinite dimensional, then to obtain the desired conclusion, some algebraic assumptions must be made on G (see below). In this setting the result is a theorem of Bargmann. Fortunately, in the crucial case of the Poincar√© group, Bargmann's theorem applies. Chapter 2, Appendix A and B. (See Wigner's classification of the representations of the universal cover of the Poincar√© group.) The requirement referred to above is that the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g does not admit a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension. This is the case if and only if the second cohomology group of \\\\mathfrak g is trivial. In this case, it may still be true that the group admits a central extension by a discrete group. But extensions of G by discrete groups are covers of G. For instance, the universal cover \\\\tilde G is related to G through the quotient G \\\\approx \\\\tilde G/\\\\Gamma with the central subgroup \\\\Gamma being the center of \\\\tilde G itself, isomorphic to the fundamental group of the covered group. Thus, in favorable cases, the quantum system will carry a unitary representation of the universal cover \\\\tilde{G} of the symmetry group G. This is desirable because \\\\mathcal H is much easier to work with than the non-vector space \\\\mathrm P\\\\mathcal H. If the representations of \\\\tilde{G} can be classified, much more information about the possibilities and properties of \\\\mathcal H are available. The Heisenberg case An example in which Bargmann's theorem does not apply comes from a quantum particle moving in \\\\mathbb R^n. The group of translational symmetries of the associated phase space, \\\\mathbb R^{2n}, is the commutative group \\\\mathbb R^{2n}. In the usual quantum mechanical picture, the \\\\mathbb R^{2n} symmetry is not implement by a unitary representation of \\\\mathbb R^{2n}. After all, in the quantum setting, translations in position space and translations in momentum space do not commute. This failure to commute reflects the failure of the position and momentum operators‚Äîwhich are the infinitesimal generators of translations in momentum space and position space, respectively‚Äîto commute. Nevertheless, translations in position space and translations in momentum space do commute up to a phase factor. Thus, we have a well-defined projective representation of \\\\mathbb R^{2n}, but it does not come from an ordinary representation of \\\\mathbb R^{2n}, even though \\\\mathbb R^{2n} is simply connected. In this case, to obtain an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the Heisenberg group, which is a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension of \\\\mathbb R^{2n}.  Poincar√© group  The group of translations and Lorentz transformations form the Poincar√© group, and this group should be a symmetry of a relativistic quantum system (neglecting general relativity effects, or in other words, in flat space). Representations of the Poincar√© group are in many cases characterized by a nonnegative mass and a half-integer spin (see Wigner's classification); this can be thought of as the reason that particles have quantized spin. (Note that there are in fact other possible representations, such as tachyons, infraparticles, etc., which in some cases do not have quantized spin or fixed mass.)  Other symmetries  The pattern of weak isospins, weak hypercharges, and color charges (weights) of all known elementary particles in the Standard Model, rotated by the weak mixing angle to show electric charge roughly along the vertical. While the spacetime symmetries in the Poincar√© group are particularly easy to visualize and believe, there are also other types of symmetries, called internal symmetries. One example is color SU(3), an exact symmetry corresponding to the continuous interchange of the three quark colors. Lie algebras versus Lie groups Many (but not all) symmetries or approximate symmetries form Lie groups. Rather than study the representation theory of these Lie groups, it is often preferable to study the closely related representation theory of the corresponding Lie algebras, which are usually simpler to compute. Now, representations of the Lie algebra correspond to representations of the universal cover of the original group. Section 5.7 In the finite-dimensional case‚Äîand the infinite-dimensional case, provided that Bargmann's theorem applies‚Äîirreducible projective representations of the original group correspond to ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover. In those cases, computing at the Lie algebra level is appropriate. This is the case, notably, for studying the irreducible projective representations of the rotation group SO(3). These are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordinary representations of the universal cover SU(2) of SO(3). The representations of the SU(2) are then in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of its Lie algebra su(2), which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3). Thus, to summarize, the irreducible projective representations of SO(3) are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible ordinary representations of its Lie algebra so(3). The two-dimensional \\"spin 1/2\\" representation of the Lie algebra so(3), for example, does not correspond to an ordinary (single-valued) representation of the group SO(3). (This fact is the origin of statements to the effect that \\"if you rotate the wave function of an electron by 360 degrees, you get the negative of the original wave function.\\") Nevertheless, the spin 1/2 representation does give rise to a well-defined projective representation of SO(3), which is all that is required physically.  Approximate symmetries  Although the above symmetries are believed to be exact, other symmetries are only approximate. Hypothetical example As an example of what an approximate symmetry means, suppose an experimentalist lived inside an infinite ferromagnet, with magnetization in some particular direction. The experimentalist in this situation would find not one but two distinct types of electrons: one with spin along the direction of the magnetization, with a slightly lower energy (and consequently, a lower mass), and one with spin anti-aligned, with a higher mass. Our usual SO(3) rotational symmetry, which ordinarily connects the spin-up electron with the spin-down electron, has in this hypothetical case become only an approximate symmetry, relating different types of particles to each other. General definition In general, an approximate symmetry arises when there are very strong interactions that obey that symmetry, along with weaker interactions that do not. In the electron example above, the two \\"types\\" of electrons behave identically under the strong and weak forces, but differently under the electromagnetic force. Example: isospin symmetry An example from the real world is isospin symmetry, an SU(2) group corresponding to the similarity between up quarks and down quarks. This is an approximate symmetry: While up and down quarks are identical in how they interact under the strong force, they have different masses and different electroweak interactions. Mathematically, there is an abstract two-dimensional vector space :\\\\text{up quark} \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\text{down quark} \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} and the laws of physics are approximately invariant under applying a determinant-1 unitary transformation to this space:Lecture notes by Prof. Mark Thomson :\\\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\mapsto A \\\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\text{where } A \\\\text{ is in } SU(2) For example, A=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0&1 \\\\ -1&0 \\\\end{pmatrix} would turn all up quarks in the universe into down quarks and vice versa. Some examples help clarify the possible effects of these transformations: *When these unitary transformations are applied to a proton, it can be transformed into a neutron, or into a superposition of a proton and neutron, but not into any other particles. Therefore, the transformations move the proton around a two-dimensional space of quantum states. The proton and neutron are called an \\"isospin doublet\\", mathematically analogous to how a spin-¬Ω particle behaves under ordinary rotation. *When these unitary transformations are applied to any of the three pions (, , and ), it can change any of the pions into any other, but not into any non-pion particle. Therefore, the transformations move the pions around a three-dimensional space of quantum states. The pions are called an \\"isospin triplet\\", mathematically analogous to how a spin-1 particle behaves under ordinary rotation. *These transformations have no effect at all on an electron, because it contains neither up nor down quarks. The electron is called an isospin singlet, mathematically analogous to how a spin-0 particle behaves under ordinary rotation. In general, particles form isospin multiplets, which correspond to irreducible representations of the Lie algebra SU(2). Particles in an isospin multiplet have very similar but not identical masses, because the up and down quarks are very similar but not identical. Example: flavour symmetry Isospin symmetry can be generalized to flavour symmetry, an SU(3) group corresponding to the similarity between up quarks, down quarks, and strange quarks. This is, again, an approximate symmetry, violated by quark mass differences and electroweak interactions‚Äîin fact, it is a poorer approximation than isospin, because of the strange quark's noticeably higher mass. Nevertheless, particles can indeed be neatly divided into groups that form irreducible representations of the Lie algebra SU(3), as first noted by Murray Gell-Mann and independently by Yuval Ne'eman.

Jenkins then studied for his PhD under the supervision of Sir John Plumb among others. Between 1977 and 1980, Jenkins worked as a researcher for Sir Leon Radzinowicz, the pioneer of criminology studies at Cambridge. In 1979, Jenkins won the BBC quiz show Mastermind. Academic career In 1980, Jenkins was appointed Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at Pennsylvania State University, which marked a change in his research focus. Jenkins has forged a reputation based on his work on global Christianity as well as on emerging religious movements. Other research interests include post-1970 American history and crime. He conducted a study of the Quran and the Bible in the light of the September 11 attacks and accusations that the Quran incites violence.

Jenkins went on to state that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism had undergone a process that he refers to as \\"holy amnesia\\" in which violence in sacred texts became symbolic action against one's sins. Islam had until recently also undergone the same process in which jihad became an internal struggle rather than war.

After the war, he was sent to Lushunkou, where he was assigned to command the newly constructed base for the Beiyang fleet. During this time, he came into contact with numerous foreign military advisors hired by Beiyang commander Li Hongzhang. After the success of China‚Äôs first imperial naval review in 1891, he was reassigned to command troops in Tianjin. During this period, he was active in suppressive various minor revolts against the Qing Dynasty, from which he was awarded the title of taiyuan (brigadier general) in 1892. In 1893, at the request of Li Hongzhang, Nie conducted an inspection tour of the Manchurian borders with Russia and Korea, with the aim of planning strategies for potential combat operations. First Sino-Japanese War In April 1894, Nie was recalled from Manchuria due to the worsening situation in Korea vis-√†- vis the Empire of Japan. By order of Li Hongzhang, he landed with a detachment of 800 soldiers in Asan, Korea on 9 June 1894, where he constructed fortifications and made forays to suppress the activities of the Donghak rebels in the surrounding provinces. He was noted for implementing strict discipline in his forces to prevent looting and violence against the local civilian population. Reinforcements brought his command to 3800 troops; however, the Japanese had occupied Seoul and Incheon by the end of July with approximately 30,000 troops. On 27 July, after receiving information about the Battle of Pungdo, and realizing that neither reinforcement nor retreat would be possible by sea, Nie decided to withdraw his forces by a circuitous route to Pyongyang to avoid becoming trapped at Asan. However, on 29 July, a Japanese combat brigade led by General Oshima Yoshimasa attacked his positions in the Battle of Seonghwan. Nie lost approximately 500 men in the engagement, along with his artillery and most of his stores, but the remainder of his forces escaped to Pyongyang. Using his good relations with the local population, he was about to avoid the bulk of the Japanese army during his escape. On 3 September, after reviewing the defenses of Pyongyang, Nie departed for Tianjin on an unsuccessful mission to request reinforcements. Ordered back to Pyongyang, he was still travelling when he received word of the Chinese defeat at the Battle of Pyongyang. Nie was subsequently in the Battle of Jiuliancheng, where his forces were assigned to the Chinese flank at the village of Hushanqian (), which bore the brunt of the Japanese assault of 24 October. His forces mostly deserted their posts, and Nie escaped with the remnants to Dandong and then to Fenghaungcheng. He burned the city on 30 October rather than to let it fall into Japanese hands, and moved north to block the path of the Japanese advance towards Mukden. He was promoted to the rank of captain general for his efforts. On 12 February 1895, he was withdrawn to Shanhai Pass, the critical point in the route to Beijing, and took no further combat role. After the war, in 1899 his army was restructured and renamed as Wuwei Front Division, trained by Russian military advisers and equipped with German and Russian weaponry, it was considered the most modern of the Qing armies of the time.Reynolds, page 73 Boxer Rebellion In general, Nie was not an active participant in the political intrigues of the Qing court, but was considered politically conservative and supported Empress Dowager Cixi against the Hundred Days' Reform. In his suppression of the Boxer Rebellion, Nie was in an ambiguous position. On one hand, as a general in the Qing army, he pursued a vigorous offensive against rebel guerilla forces in early 1900. Condemned by the pro-Boxer faction of the Imperial Court, Nie achieved impressive success inflicting large numbers of casualties during the year.Bouye, page 66-67 On the other hand, he could not accept the invasion of China by the Eight-Nation Alliance so he fought against the Alliance forces. Because Nie's forces killed so many Boxers, it was Dong Fuxiang's Kansu Braves who instead allied with the Boxers to oppose the Seymour Expedition, a multinational force of over 2,000 men, in its march to Beijing. On 9 July 1900, while personally leading a counterattack against Russian forces under the command of General Anatoly Stessel in the Battle of Tientsin, Nie was fatally wounded when an artillery shell exploded nearby. In the Nankai District of Tianjin in present-day China, a \\"Nie Shicheng Martyrs Monument\\" is located in the area, to General Nie Shichen who died in battle in the Boxer Rebellion at the Battle of Tientsin.Nie Shicheng Martyrs Monument References *Bouye, Thomas.

The film begins with a giant fissure destroying an entire village. This leads to an investigation whereby the source is discovered to be Moguera, a giant robot, who is then destroyed by the military. The remains are analyzed and discovered to be of alien origin. Shortly after, an alien race known as the Mysterians arrive, declaring they have taken some Earth women captive and that they demand both land and the right to marry women of Earth. For The Mysterians, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka recruited Jojiro Okami, a science fiction writer, to develop the story. Honda later elaborated that he wanted the film to differ from both Godzilla and Rodan and to make it more of a \\"true science fiction film,\\" one to promote peace and understanding between cultures. The film was popular upon its release in Japan, where it was among the top ten grossing domestic productions of the year. Contemporary reviews from Western critics in the Monthly Film Bulletin and Variety praised the special effect work but criticized the plot as confusing and juvenile, respectively. Plot Astrophysicist Ryoichi Shiraishi, his fiancee Hiroko, his sister Etsuko, and his friend Joji Atsumi attend a festival at a local village near Mount Fuji. Shiraishi then tells Atsumi that he has broken off his engagement with Hiroko but gives no reason other than an undisclosed obligation to remain in the village. Then, a mysterious forest fire flares up, burning more rapidly than normal and emanating from the ground, and Shiraishi rushes out to investigate and disappears during the confusion. The next day, Atsumi is at the local observatory, where he meets with his mentor, head astronomer, Tanjiro Adachi. He hands the doctor a report written by Shiraishi that concerns a newly discovered asteroid that Shiraishi theorized was once a planet between Mars and Jupiter. He has named it Mysteroid. However, Adachi does not believe in his radical theory and also points out that the report is not complete. Meanwhile, the village in which the festival was held is completely wiped out by a massive earthquake. While investigating the area, Atsumi and a group of police officers stumble upon a giant robot, Moguera, which bursts from the side of a hill. It emits rays which decimate the investigation team; only Atsumi and the lead policeman survive. The robot then advances to a town near Koyama Bridge that night, and is met by heavy resistance from Japan's self- defense force. However, the conventional artillery has no effect on the war machine, and the automaton continues its rampage until it tries to cross the Koyama Bridge, which is detonated, sending the machine crashing down to the ground below and destroying it. At the National Diet Building, Atsumi briefs officials on what has been learned about the robot. The remains of the giant machine reveal that it was manufactured out of an unknown chemical compound. Shortly afterwards, astronomers witness activity in outer space around the moon. They alert the world to this discovery, and not long after, the aliens emerge, their gigantic dome breaking through Earth's crust near Mount Fuji. As a combined military and scientific entourage observes the dome, a voice calls out to request five scientists, including Dr. Adachi, who is among the observers, to come to the dome for a conference. The men agree to this meeting and are formally ushered into the dome, where the Mysterians, a scientifically advanced humanoid alien race, list their demands from the people of Earth: a two-mile-radius strip of land and the right to marry women of Earth. The reason for this is that 100,000 years ago their planet--Mysteroid, once the fifth planet from the sun--was destroyed by a nuclear war. Some Mysterians were able to escape to Mars before their planet was rendered uninhabitable. However, owing to the nuclear war, strontium-90 has left 80 percent of the aliens' population deformed and crippled. The proposed interbreeding with women on Earth would produce healthier offspring and keep their race alive. The latter part of their demands is downplayed, as they admit to already taking three women captive and reveal two others that they are interested in, one of which is Etsuko. Japan quickly dismisses this request and begins the mobilization of its armed forces around Mount Fuji. It is also discovered that the missing Shiraishi has sided with the advance race because of their technological achievements. Japan wastes no time, though, and quickly launches a full-scale attack against the Mysterians' dome. However, the modern weaponry is no match for their technology, and Japan's forces are easily fought back. Distraught by this setback, Japan sends their plea to other nations that they join together to remove the threat of the Mysterians from Earth. The nations around the world answer the plea and in no time issue another raid against the Mysterians' dome, this time utilizing the newly developed Alpha and Beta class airships. Sadly, this attack meets failure as well. The Mysterians then increase their demand, asking for a 75-mile-radius plot of land, as the Earth continues to develop a new method of attack. Earth's efforts in this matter pay off as a Markalite FAHP (Flying Atomic Heat Projector), a gigantic lens that can reflect the Mysterians‚Äô weaponry, is designed. Meanwhile, the Mysterians kidnap Etsuko and Hiroko, causing Atsumi to search for, and locate, a cave entrance to a tunnel under the Mysterians' dome. In the meantime, the Markalite FAHP's are deployed by large Markalite GYRO rockets, and the final battle against the Mysterians' base of operations commences. Atsumi enters the dome and finds the women, alive and unharmed, in an unguarded room. Taking them back to the tunnel, Atsumi finds Shiraishi, who admits the Mysterians duped him and have no good intentions, and then returns to the dome and sacrifices himself in a final attack on the base from the inside while the Markalite FAHP's assault the base from above ground. The dome collapses and then explodes as Adachi and the women reach safety in the hills above the Mysterians' occupied land. A few enemy spaceships are observed fleeing into space, out of range of Earth weaponry, and Dr. Adachi comments on the need for continued vigilance.

I would like to wipe away the [Cold War-era] notion of East versus West and convey a simple, universal aspiration for peace, the coming together of all humankind as one to create a peaceful society.\\" For The Mysterians, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka recruited Jojiro Okami, an aeronautical engineer and military test pilot who later became a science fiction writer. Reflecting on the period of developing the film, Honda stated that he respected scientists, but \\"feared the danger of science, that whoever controlled it could take over the entire Earth.\\" The Mysterians marks the first collaboration between Honda and special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya that was shot in anamorphic TohoScope, which the studio had just recently introduced. In their book on Honda, Ryfle and Godziszewski stated that accurate budget figures for The Mysterians are elusive. Honda had stated that the film was more expensive than Godzilla and Rodan. Release The Mysterians was released in 28 December 1957 in Japan. The film was re-issued theatrically in Japan on 18 March 1978. The film was described by Ryfle and Godziszewski as a \\"significant hit\\", earning 193 million yen in the domestic box office. It was Toho's second highest grossing film of the year, only being behind Hiroshi Inagaki's Rickshaw Man, and was the tenth highest grossing film in Japan overall. In the United States, The Mysterians was originally purchased by RKO Radio Pictures, which provided the dubbing, but was sold to Loew's Inc. for release due to RKO's failing fortunes. The film was double-billed with Watusi and released in 15 May 1959 via MGM. According to MGM records the film made the studio a profit of only $58,000 in the United States.. Reception From contemporary reviews, The New York Times called the film \\"an ear-splitting Japanese-made fantasy, photographed in runny color and dubbed English,\\" and concluded: \\"This Metro release is crammed with routine footage of death rays and scrambling civilians, not one of whom can act.\\" Variety called it \\"well-produced\\", noting \\"special effects involving sliding land, quaking earth and melting mortars are realistically accomplished proving the facility with the Japanese filmmakers deal in miniatures.\\" but found the film \\"As corny as it is furious\\" noting that \\"While Junior may be moved by the arrival of outer-space gremlins, big brother and all like him will laugh their heads off.\\" The review commented on the English dub, stating that it was \\"understandable enough, but one might easily believe something was lost in translation.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote that the film is \\"far better than most American-made pictures of its type\\" and \\"\\"although the story idea offers little that is novel, the action holds one's interest well mainly because of the imaginative settings, the elaborate space ship used by the invaders along with its many electronic gadgets, and the very good special effects by which catastrophic scenes of destruction are depicted while the invaders and the Earthians battle each other [with] all sorts of weapons.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin noted that the version the reviewer viewed was a \\"banal American-dubbed version\\" and that its \\"main weaknesses are a slight and confused plot, under-developed characterisation and artless acting;\\" The review praised the film's \\"imaginative art direction and spectacular staging\\" which the review stated as \\"possibly the most dazzling display of pyrotechnics in the genre to date.\\" Motion Picture Daily praised the film's effects, writing that \\"even the most jaded action fan will have to admit that some of the scenes of mass catastrophes, the seemingly endless sky and ground skirmishes and the ultra-modern 'Buck Rogers' settings have seldom, if ever, been equalled.\\" In a retrospective on Soviet science fiction film, British director Alex Cox compared The Mysterians to First Spaceship on Venus but described the latter as \\"more complex and morally ambiguous.\\" AllMovie praises the film for its special effects. In a retrospective review, Sight & Sound found that \\"Its space-age visuals and colourful design anticipate the spectacular fantasies Honda would go on to make for Toho in the [1960s], including Mothra, Godzilla vs. The Thing, Ghidrah The Three-Headed Monster and Invasion of the Astro-Monsters.\\" See also * List of Japanese films of 1957  References =FootnotesSources  * External links  * Category:1950s science fiction films Category:1957 films Category:Films scored by Akira Ifukube Category:Films directed by Ishir≈ç Honda Category:Films produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka Category:Films set in Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Films set in Tochigi Prefecture Category:Films set in Tokyo Category:Films set in Yamanashi Prefecture Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Kaiju films Category:1950s monster movies Category:Robot films Category:Toho tokusatsu films Category:Alien invasions in films ","title":"The Mysterians"},{"id":"3566982","text":"The Canton of Ch√¢teauneuf-sur-Sarthe is a former French canton located in the Maine-et-Loire d√©partement of France, in the arrondissement of Segr√©.

The song is a political satire about the development of suburbia, and associated conformist middle- class attitudes. It mocks suburban tract housing as \\"little boxes\\" of different colors \\"all made out of ticky-tacky\\", and which \\"all look just the same\\". \\"Ticky-tacky\\" is a reference to the shoddy material supposedly used in the construction of the houses.  Background  Reynolds was a folk singer- songwriter and political activist in the 1960s and 1970s. Nancy Reynolds, her daughter, explained that her mother wrote the song after seeing the housing developments around Daly City, California, built in the post-war era by Henry Doelger, particularly the neighborhood of Westlake. > My mother and father were driving South from San Francisco through Daly City > when my mom got the idea for the song. She asked my dad to take the wheel, > and she wrote it on the way to the gathering in La Honda where she was going > to sing for the Friends Committee on Legislation. When Time magazine (I > think, maybe Newsweek) wanted a photo of her pointing to the very place, she > couldn't find those houses because so many more had been built around them > that the hillsides were totally covered. Reynolds' version was first released on her 1967 Columbia Records album Malvina Reynolds Sings the Truth,Reynolds, Malvina. Malvina Reynolds Sings the Truth, Columbia Records, 1967. CS-9414 and can also be found on the Smithsonian Folkways Records 2000 CD re-issue of Ear To The Ground. However, Pete Seeger's rendition of the song is known internationally, and it reached number 70 in the Billboard Hot 100. Also a political activist, Seeger was a friend of Reynolds and, like many others in the 1960s, he used folk songs as a medium for social protest.  Reception and analysis  The effectiveness of the satire was attested to by a university professor quoted in 1964 in Time magazine as saying, \\"I've been lecturing my classes about middle-class conformity for a whole semester. Here's a song that says it all in 1¬Ω minutes;\\" however, according to Christopher Hitchens, satirist Tom Lehrer described \\"Little Boxes\\" as \\"the most sanctimonious song ever written\\". Historian Nell Irvin Painter points out that the conformity described in \\"Little Boxes\\" was not entirely a bad thing, indicative as it was of \\"a process of going to university to be doctors and lawyers and business executives\\" who \\"came out all the same\\" and then lived in \\"nice, new neighborhoods with good new schools. ... Suburbia may be monotone, but it was a sameness to be striven toward.\\"Painter, Nell Irvin (2010) The History of White People. New York: Norton. p.369. The term \\"ticky-tacky\\" became a catchphrase during the 1960s, attesting to the song's popularity. Covers The song has been recorded by many musicians and bands, some of whom have arranged and translated the song to meet their styles. The lyrics have been reprinted with photographs of \\"Little Box\\" houses in environmental publications. Artists who have covered the song include Devendra Banhart, Bomb the Music Industry!, Compost, Elvis Costello, Death Cab for Cutie, The Decemberists (who added several new lyrics), Tim DeLaughter of The Polyphonic Spree, Donovan, Anjan Dutt, Ben Folds, Skott Freedman, Engelbert Humperdinck, The Individuals, Jenny and Johnny, Ang√©lique Kidjo, Rilo Kiley, Kinky, Linkin Park, Man Man, The Mountain Goats, Randy Newman, Nina & Frederik, Ozomatli, Phosphorescent, The Real Tuesday Weld, Rise Against, Paddy Roberts, The Shins, Regina Spektor, The Submarines, Billy Bob Thornton, Walk off the Earth, and The Womenfolk, whose 1964 version of the song was the shortest single ever to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, at 1 minute 2 seconds, peaking at #83; in 2016, it was surpassed by \\"PPAP (Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen)\\", at only 45 seconds. Many of these covers were recorded as theme music for the television program Weeds, which in its second, third and eighth seasons featured a different artists' performance of the song for each episode's opening credits. The Spanish songwriter Adolfo Celdr√°n wrote the first Spanish version of the song, called \\"Cajitas\\", which was released in 1969 and had several successive reissues. Another Spanish version of the song, \\"Las Casitas del Barrio Alto\\", was written by the Chilean songwriter V√≠ctor Jara in 1971, depicting in a mocking way the over-Europeanized and bourgeois lifestyle of the residents of the \\"Barrio Alto\\" (high-class neighborhood) in Santiago de Chile. A French version with the title \\"Petites bo√Ætes\\" was performed by Graeme Allwright and was later covered by Kate & Anna McGarrigle on their 2003 album La vache qui pleure and by Weepers Circus on their 2009 album √† la r√©cr√©. Haim Hefer wrote a Hebrew version of this song, called \\"Tik shel Plastik\\" (◊™◊ô◊ß ◊©◊ú ◊§◊ú◊°◊ò◊ô◊ß, \\"a plastic bag\\"), satirizing the Israeli middle class, which was recorded by The Seven Species on a 1968 album.

He would continue to be associated with VKhUTEMAS as a professor of color theory from 1924 until the school closed in 1930. Klutsis taught, wrote, and produced political art for the Soviet state for the rest of his life. As the political background degraded through the 1920s and 1930s, Klutsis and Kulagina came under increasing pressure to limit their subject matter and techniques. Once joyful, revolutionary and utopian, by 1935 their art was devoted to furthering Joseph Stalin's cult of personality. Despite his active and loyal service to the party, Klutsis was arrested in Moscow on 16 January 1938, as a part of the so-called \\"Latvian Operation\\" as he prepared to leave for the New York World's Fair. Kulagina agonized for months, then years, over his disappearance. His sentence was passed by the NKVD Commission and the USSR Prosecutor‚Äôs Office on 11 February 1938, and he was executed on 26 February 1938, at the Butovo NKVD training ground near Moscow.

Latvian National Museum of Art. Klutsis worked in a variety of experimental media. He liked to use propaganda as a sign or revolutionary background image. His first project of note, in 1922, was a series of semi-portable multimedia agitprop kiosks to be installed on the streets of Moscow, integrating \\"radio-orators\\", film screens, and newsprint displays, all to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Revolution. Like other Constructivists he worked in sculpture, produced exhibition installations, illustrations and ephemera. But Klutsis and Kulagina are primarily known for their photomontages. The names of some of their best posters, such as \\"Electrification of the whole country\\" (1920), \\"There can be no revolutionary movement without a revolutionary theory\\" (1927), and \\"Field shock workers into the fight for the socialist reconstruction\\" (1932), belied the fresh, powerful, and sometimes eerie images. For economy they often posed for, and inserted themselves into, these images, disguised as shock workers or peasants. Their dynamic compositions, distortions of scale and space, angled viewpoints and colliding perspectives make them perpetually modern. Klutsis is one of four artists with a claim to having invented the subgenre of political photo montage in 1918 (along with the German Dadaists Hannah H√∂ch and Raoul Hausmann, and the Russian El Lissitzky). He worked alongside Lissitzky on the Pressa International exhibition in Cologne.

In basketball, a flagrant foul is a personal foul that involves excessive or violent contact that could injure the fouled player. A flagrant foul may be unintentional or purposeful; the latter type is also called an \\"intentional foul\\" in the National Basketball Association (NBA). However, not all intentional fouls are flagrant fouls, as it is an accepted strategy to intentionally commit a foul (without intent to injure) in order to regain possession of the ball while minimizing how much time elapses on the game clock. NBA The National Basketball Association (NBA) established the flagrant foul to deter contact that, in addition to being against the rules, puts an opponent's safety or health at risk. When the flagrant foul was introduced in the 1990‚Äì91 season, the only penalty beyond that of a common personal foul was that the coach of the offended team could select which player would shoot the resulting free throw attempts. Starting with the 1990‚Äì91 season, the offended team also retains possession of the ball following a flagrant foul, in addition to receiving free throw attempts. The NBA defines two levels of flagrant fouls, \\"Flagrant 1\\" and \\"Flagrant 2\\". Flagrant 1 is \\"unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent\\", while the more serious Flagrant 2 is \\"unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent.\\" Flagrant 2 results in an immediate ejection of the offender. Flagrant 1 does not result in the offender's ejection, unless the same player commits a second Flagrant 1 foul in the same game. Thus, Flagrant 1 and Flagrant 2 are analogous to the yellow card and red card used in various other sports. NBA referees have discretion in determining which level to call. Starting with the 2006‚Äì07 season, all Flagrant 2 fouls are reviewed via instant replay, and may be downgraded as a result of the review. Flagrant 2 fouls result in an automatic fine of the offending player. Additionally, the NBA has a \\"penalty points\\" system, whereby players committing a Flagrant 1 or Flagrant 2 are assessed one or two penalty points, respectively. During the regular season, accumulating more than five points results in an automatic suspension. During the NBA playoffs, suspensions of one or two games are meted out for every penalty point a player accrues above a total of three. Game tactics It is an accepted basketball strategy for a trailing team to commit fouls intentionally late in a game, in an attempt to regain possession of the ball while minimizing how much time elapses on the game clock. A common personal foul gives the fouling team a chance to regain possession of the ball by rebounding a missed free throw. Alternately, if the offended team makes both free throws, the fouling team will then be given possession of the ball, potentially giving them an opportunity to make a three-point field goal, which if made, yields a one-point gain to the fouling team. In this context, the flagrant foul rule deters undesired, potentially injurious play by awarding possession of the ball to the offended team as an extra penalty. If the fouling team is judged to have committed a flagrant foul, the offended team retains possession of the ball following any free throw attempts. As there is no change in possession, there is no benefit to the team that committed the flagrant foul. Thus, teams that attempt a strategy of intentionally fouling, must do so without having their fouls judged as flagrant. FIBA International Basketball Federation (FIBA) basketball rules have similar fouls but use different terms. *FIBA's unsportsmanlike foul is comparable to a Flagrant 1. Two in one game by the same player, or one unsportsmanlike and one technical foul result in automatic ejection of that player. Any of the following five criteria constitutes an unsportsmanlike foul: **C1: The foul is not a legitimate attempt to directly play the ball within the spirit and intent of the rules. **C2: The foul is an excessive, hard contact caused by a player in an effort to play the ball or an opponent. **C3: There is an unnecessary contact caused by the defensive player in order to stop the progress of the offensive team in transition. This applies until the offensive player begins his act of shooting. **C4: There is a contact by the defensive player from behind or laterally on an opponent in an attempt to stop the fast break and there is no defensive player between the offensive player and the opponents‚Äô basket. This applies until the offensive player begins his act of shooting. **C5: Any contact by the defensive player on an opponent on the playing court when the game clock shows 2:00 minutes or less in the fourth quarter and in each overtime, when the ball is out-of-bounds for a throw-in and still in the hands of the official or at the disposal of the player taking the throw-in. *FIBA's disqualifying foul is comparable to a Flagrant 2 and results in immediate ejection of the offender. It is defined in the rulebook as any flagrant unsportsmanlike action by players, substitutes, head coaches, etc. The penalty for these fouls in full-court basketball is two free throws and a throw-in from the throw-in line in the team‚Äôs frontcourt. In the halfcourt 3x3 variant, the penalty is also two free throws, but possession after the free throws varies based on the degree of the foul. After a player's first unsportsmanlike foul, possession goes to the team that was otherwise entitled to possession at the time of the play. Following any foul that results in ejection, possession goes to the non-offending team. The only exception is in the case of a double unsportsmanlike foul; no free throws are awarded in such a situation. United States scholastic rules U.S. college and high school rules define a flagrant foul as a personal or technical foul that is extreme or severe. NCAA The NCAA's Playing Rules Oversight Panel adopted the \\"flagrant\\" term before the 2011-12 season for both men's and women's basketball. However, the NCAA's women's rules committee abandoned the term \\"flagrant\\", effective with the 2017‚Äì18 season, in favor of FIBA's \\"unsportsmanlike\\" and \\"disqualifying\\" terms. These fouls are counted as personal fouls and technical fouls. *A flagrant 1 foul (men's) or unsportsmanlike foul (women's) involves excessive or severe contact during a live ball, including especially when a player \\"swings an elbow and makes illegal, non-excessive contact with an opponent above the shoulders\\". This offense includes the former \\"intentional foul\\" of fouling an opposing player to prevent an easy breakaway score. In women's basketball only, the unsportsmanlike foul also includes contact dead-ball technical fouls. The penalty for a flagrant 1 or unsportsmanlike foul is two free throws and a throw-in for the opposing team at the out-of-bounds spot nearest the foul. *A flagrant 2 foul (men's) or disqualifying foul (women's) involves unsportsmanlike conduct that is extreme in nature, including \\"when a player swings an elbow excessively and makes contact above the shoulders\\", or excessive or severe contact during a dead ball (men only). Fighting is also a flagrant 2 or disqualifying foul. The penalty for a flagrant 2 or disqualifying foul is immediate ejection of the offender, plus two free throws and a throw-in for the opposing team at the division line opposite the scorer's table. Certain conduct constitutes a flagrant foul despite not being malevolent or unsportsmanlike. NFHS In the United States, the NFHS rulebook defines flagrant fouls in Rule 10: Fouls and Penalties. The word \\"flagrant\\" itself is defined in Rule 2: Definitions; 2-16c calls it \\"a foul so severe or extreme that it places an opponent in danger of serious injury, and/or involves violations that are extremely or persistently vulgar or abusive conduct.\\" Equivalents in other sports *In American football, such fouls generally result in a personal foul, such as unnecessary roughness, or an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, and possibly ejection. *In football, such fouls generally result in either a yellow card or a red card being issued. *In ice hockey, such fouls sometimes result in a boarding, attempt to injure or other infraction being called and may result in either a major or game misconduct, or match penalty.

It was originally a Gothic church that was reworked in the Baroque style in the 17th century. The Baroque altars and sculptures in the church date from the late 18th century and were created by Peter ≈Ωiwobski (1752‚Äì?). In addition to the main altar dedicated to Saint James, there are two side altars, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and John of Nepomuk. The ceiling fresco was painted by Vinko Tu≈°ek (1936‚Äì2011). The church's organ was built in 1830 by Johann Gottfried Kunath (before 1790 ‚Äì after 1846). There is a cemetery on the west wide of the church. Tabor Church The picturesque fortified Tabor Church, in the hamlet of Podtabor on a rock above the motorway from Ljubljana to the Karawanks Tunnel, is a well-known landmark on the route. It was built some time soon after 1471 as a fortification where the locals could escape from Ottoman raids. The worst Ottoman incursions across Upper Carniola and into Carinthia were in 1476 and 1477. The building of the walls around the church was conditioned by the favourable natural position on an elevation in the middle of a plain, affording a view in all directions. The walls surrounding the church are irregularly shaped and were built on two levels with a roofed walkway, balistraria, and defense tower. The defence tower overlooked the only entrance over a drawbridge. On the western side the church was fortified with a moat and dike. This was also where valuables, food, and livestock were kept.Podbrezje local web site The church is dedicated to Saint Benedict and Our Lady of Sorrows.

An original collage art piece of Sourdough Sam hangs in Levi's Stadium and is located in the players' family room. History Before the introduction of Sourdough Sam, the 49ers' first mascot was a mule named Clementine that wore a red saddle blanket and appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. A gold rush prospector‚Äìthemed character first appeared in the 1970s. The character's design reflected the cover art of programs created by William Kay between 1946 and 1949‚Äîwhen the 49ers were a part of the All-America Football Conference‚Äîwhich depicted a bushy-mustached prospector with two pistols. Sourdough Sam's persona later underwent a slight change from prospector to miner. As a miner, he depicted a large man with an oversized football helmet and plaid shirt matching that worn in the original William Kay cover art. Several elements of this version of Sourdough Sam, such as a bushy beard and suspenders, remained part of his image in later iterations. In 1985, this version of Sourdough Sam appeared in a cookbook titled 49er Fixens. Another design change switched his helmet for a wide-brimmed ten-gallon hat with a chunk taken out of its brim and gave him a longer brown beard and larger, brown eyes. Just prior to the 2006 NFL Season, Sam's appearance was altered somewhat: He appeared as a clean-shaven gold panner with blue eyes and a hat without any imperfections. Sourdough Sam returned for the 2011 season with a beard and blue eyes. Outfit Sourdough Sam typically wears a cardinal football jersey, despite the 49ers' current selection of team color being 49ers Red, and his jersey number is 49. He wears a white long-sleeved shirt underneath the jersey and sports light brown gloves as well as a gold handkerchief around his neck. He also wears a large, dark brown cowboy hat emblazoned with the logo for the 49ers and dark brown boots. His jeans are held up by suspenders, and in 2014 he was outfitted with a new pair of Levi's jeans after 60 years of wearing a non-branded pair, with promotional images of his entering Levi's Taylor Shop and watching his custom pair be produced. He sometimes carries a large pickax. However, Sourdough Sam has made appearances with other outfits for special occasions. He has appeared with black boots and a black third jersey that was introduced in 2015, a camouflage shirt and jacket with camouflage headband for military related appearances, a red and white Santa suit-esqe top for holiday promotion, and a pink shirt with purple handkerchief for breast cancer awareness efforts. When meeting Snoop Dogg, Sourdough Sam wore shutter shades and a massive gold chain around his neck with the words \\"SOUR DIZZLE\\". Social media He has a Facebook page with over 80,000 likes and a Twitter page with username @SourdoughSam49, both of which release posts referring to him in the first person. These social media outlets are often used for promotional advertising content portrayed as being endorsed by Sam himself, such as the Faithful 49 Loyalty Program and the 49ers' Kids Club. Sourdough Sam's birthday is April 9, likely coinciding with the month-date format of the day, 4/9. In 2015, a video of Sourdough Sam making his own birthday cake was released on this date. Outside appearances He has appeared on Fox, Monday Night Football, ESPN's SportsCenter, Extra, MTV, Evening Magazine, and Nickelodeon.

In 2007, he split time between the \\"High A\\" St. Lucie Mets and Double-A Binghamton Mets and in 2008, he split time between Binghamton and the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. Nickeas earned his first promotion to the major leagues on September 2, 2010. He made his major league debut the same day on Jenrry Mej√≠a's first major league start on September 4, 2010 as he was the Mets catcher against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. On September 29, he got his first two major league hits against the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit his first major league home run April 21, 2011, off Houston Astros pitcher J.A. Happ. On May 1, 2011 he was sent down to the minors as Ronny Paulino came up to the Mets. For the beginning of the 2012 Mets season, Nickeas played as a backup catcher for Josh Thole. On May 26, 2012, Nickeas hit a grand slam at Citi Field, scoring Ike Davis, Vinny Rottino, and Kirk Nieuwenhuis. On July 25, Nickeas was once again sent down to the minors as Rob Johnson came up to the Mets. He was recalled on September 1 due to rosters expanding. On November 9, Nickeas signed a minor league deal with the Mets with an invitation to spring training. He had elected free agency after being outrighted off the 40-man roster. Toronto Blue Jays On December 17, 2012, the Mets traded Nickeas, R.A. Dickey, and Josh Thole to the Toronto Blue Jays for Travis d'Arnaud, Noah Syndergaard, John Buck, and Wuilmer Becerra.

He was subsequently cryopreserved by Alcor. Leaf joined the United States Army and fought in special operations during the Vietnam War. Upon return, he received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Cerritos College. He also worked as a cardiothoracic surgery researcher at the UCLA School of Medicine, co-authoring more than 20 papers from the laboratory of Dr. Gerald Buckberg. During the late 1970s and 1980s, Leaf transformed the field of cryonics by bringing unprecedented medical expertise to the field and introducing technologies and procedures of thoracic surgery, especially heart-lung bypass, for improved blood vessel access and life support of cryonics patients. Leaf was involved in the first experiments done by a cryonics organization. He is most famous for developing with Mike Darwin a blood substitute shown capable of sustaining life in dogs for four hours at near-freezing temperatures. Leaf was the head of Alcor's suspension team and participated in many suspensions of Alcor patients. Cryovita Laboratories In 1978, after teaching surgery as a research associate at UCLA, Leaf founded Cryovita Laboratories. Cryovita was a for-profit organization which provided cryopreservation services and the building for Alcor in the 1980s, including storage of the first cryonics patient, James Bedford, from 1982. During this time, Leaf also collaborated with Michael Darwin in a series of hypothermia experiments in which dogs were resuscitated with no measurable neurological deficit after hours in deep hypothermia, just a few degrees above zero Celsius. The blood substitute which was developed for these experiments became the basis for the washout solution used at Alcor. Together, Leaf and Darwin developed a standby-transport model for human cryonics cases with the goal of intervening immediately after cardiac arrest and minimizing ischemic injury, the \\"gold standard\\" of technology at that time, in which a patient's kidney was considered to be in transplantable condition two days after her death. Leaf and Darwin transferred Bedford, the first person cryopreserved, to a more technologically advanced dewar at Alcor in 1991 and were able to examine him at that time. A member of the Society for Cryobiology, Leaf objected to a 1980s change by the Society to amend its bylaws to prevent cryonicists from holding membership in the Society. With no history of heart disease, Leaf suffered a fatal heart attack in 1991. Leaf was cryopreserved by Alcor.

They can be found in Cuba, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Sugar mill in Ingenio Consuelo, Dominican Republic. In Cuba and the Dominican Republic, the basic conglomerate unit of a sugar production is usually called an ingenio. An ingenio consists of a central administrative office, a sugar cane mill, a sugar refinery, the town around the office and refinery, sugar fields (campos de ca√±a), and miscellaneous production equipment like trucks, trains, tractors, weighing scales, and housing for workers, usually in what is called a batey. Canefields beside a batey near Ingenio Consuelo, Dominican Republic. A batey is a company town consisting of barracks and a few houses. Bateyes vary in size considerably. They are located close to cane fields so that groups of workers can live nearby their labor site. Dwellings on a batey in Holgu√≠n, Cuba. Dominican Republic Every year since 1933, seasonal immigrants from Haiti have arrived to work the sugar harvest in the Dominican Republic. The migrants are lodged in rooms at the batey sometimes with no facilities and expected to work cropping sugar cane in long days with hard hours. In the past, Dominican heads of state paid Haitian heads of state a finder's fee to round up large numbers of Haitians. However, the Dominican Government has sent police officers to kidnap Haitian men, women, and children, destroyed their documents and have forcibly moved them to the bateys in the Dominican Republic. These days, individual ingenios and land owners (colonos) pay headhunters (buscones), a fee for each cane cutter (picador) the headhunter provides. A headhunter may entice the prospective labourer with promises of a work permit, and often requires a large fee from the prospective immigrant. When immigrants arrive, they may find that they are not free to leave the batey until they finish the labor. Over time, some of these migrants have stayed through the six months that follow the cane harvest (zafra), called \\"dead time\\" (tiempo muerto), and have started families with Haitian women that have migrated as well. Bateys are unique in culture and language in their mix of which is Haitian and which is Dominican. Kitchen facilities in a dwelling on a batey. The Dominican government has historically provided fewer public services to bateys than to similarly sized communities in the rest of the country. The bateys were regarded as exceptions to the country's governance system. It was often left to the State Sugar Council (CEA: Consejo Estatal de Az√∫car) or private companies to provide basic services, a responsibility that all too often they did not fulfill. Bateys were often still regarded as places where only Haitians (non-citizens) live. Since the Haitians who originally filled the bateys were not legal immigrants, their children have often been denied citizenship papers because they are in transit. Without citizenship papers from Haiti, these children of Haitian immigrants cannot go to school nor can they receive the benefits of other public services; however, a number of non-governmental organizations have attempted to address this problem by operating primary schools on bateys trying to get them Dominican citizenship. Consuelo, Dominican Republic. In the past, sugar was a profitable industry. However, the Dominican sugar industry is no longer competitive, and when combined with the historical lack of educational and health services to these communities, the low wages have tended to make bateys some of the poorest communities in the country. The current trend in the Dominican Republic is for the ingenios to stop production, and thus the only source of income for the community and for the bateys to very slowly transform themselves into new sorts of communities. Los Alcarrizos in the Santo Domingo province is a good example of something that used to be a batey but now is a municipality which survives through jobs in the area and in Santo Domingo. The Batey is a modern form of slavery where Haitians are paid less than $2.00 American dollars for 12-14 hours of labor. They are forced to sleep on foam boards and live without electricity or running water.

Guitar duties were filled out by Rowan MacPhail, and in 2006 Harmony was added on keys. After EMI Music Canada president Deane Cameron came and saw the band at the bovine sex club in Toronto, the band signed to EMI in December, 2006 and began recording new 2 new songs to be added to the album originally called Obitus.

In June 2009, the band hired new drummer, Phil Elliot, who was friends with Matthew after Matthew had recorded Phil's band, \\"Born Destroyers\\". Matthew returned on rhythm guitar, which he had also played on all of the band's recording, and consequently, guitarist Rowan MacPhail was asked to step down as the band's guitarist.

It was the capital of the Ratta dynasty (from 875-1230), until the capital shifted to Belgaum. * During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Belagaon (Belgaum) was the capital of the Rattas, the chieftains of Saundatti. The fort at Belgaum was built by Bichiraja (Ratta Dynasty) in 1204. * The Ratta clan was one of several names of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty. * Rattas of Saundatti accepted the overlordship of Taila II (AD 973-977). * Two of the pillars at Belgaum fort have Kannada inscriptions in Nagari script, one inscription from around 1199 is attributed to the Ratta king Kartaveerya IV.

Renuka Saagura  Renuka Saagura is a reservoir by the Muluprubha River adjacent to Saundatti, formed by the Naviluteertha Dam. The name Renuka Saagura is because of the Renuka (Yullumma) temple at Yullummagudda, Saundatti.  Yullummagudda  The temple of the goddess Yellamma or Shree Renukadevi, is a pilgrimage site for Shakti devotees. Every day, hundreds of pilgrims visit the temple.

It was a noted commercial center. As per the studies conducted by the department of archaeology, the temple of Shri Kalika Devi in Sirsangi might have been constructed during the first century. Sirsangi is a place which is prominent in Karnataka and this is due to the monuments and temples in and around this small village. Earlier this place was known as Pirising but later, during the Medieval era, the name was changed as Hirisingi.... Inside View of Temple Mythology The temple of Shri Kalika Devi in Sirsangi is of mythological significance as its name is mentioned in many Hindu mythologies. One such myth mentions that a saint by the name of Vrushya Shrunga was involved in penance in Vrushya Shrunga Tapovan, which is currently the place where the temple of Shri Kalika Devi is. However, demons like Narundasur (Naragun da), Bettasura (Betasur) and Nalundasur (Navalagund) disturbed his meditation. Then the goddesses Chikkumbasura (Chikkumbi) and Hirekumbasura (Hirekumbi) killed these demons heeding the pleas of the ascetic Vrushya Shrunga. The goddesses later settled down here and hence the temple of Shri Kalika Devi was erected in Shirasangi. Geography Inside View of Temple There are two small hillocks at the outskirts of the village, one having a cave locally called Maunappanagavi and the hillock is called Kallupuragudda. Inside the cave is a hill which can accommodate about 200 people; after this is a six-meter-long passage leading to a small pit having water. Another hillock near Kalika temple has a cave locally called Siddeshwaragavi, approachable by climbing nearly 200 steps. Inside the cave is a Shivalinga. Worship Depending upon devotees pledges, they put jaggery, wheat, coconuts, rice, edible oil, etc. equivalent to their weight in Tulaa Bhara Seva. Anna Dasoha seva is also a part of worship. Temple activities Many devotees, to complete their vows and pledges on their behalf or on behalf of their family members & also to follow traditional vows... Festivals=Ugadi Ugadi is one of the major festivals celebrated by Vishwakarmas of this region. The Vishwakarma Samaj Vikas Samsthe organizes religious and cultural programmes on the Amavasya(Dark-moon Day). Devotees offer wheat grown in their fields to the goddess. The famous \\"Butti\\" ritual is performed during the early hours of the Padyami. Halegodi Amavasya Halegodi Amavasya is celebrated next to Ugadi Amavasya. Vishwakarma Mahotsava This is grandly celebrated on Chatti Amavasya every year. Vishwakarma caste Vishwakarma Caste also known as Dhiman describes a Caste of India who claim to be descendants of Lord Vishwakarma. They are a caste of engineers, architects, sculptors, temple builders and artists. The term is applied to five sub- castes; blacksmiths, carpenters, coppersmiths, goldsmiths and sculptors. The contribution of the Vishwakarmis to Hindu art and architecture is immense. The University of Nalanda has been an architectural marvel for ages together as also the iron pillars of Delhi. At the same time Hindu architecture as well as Buddhist architecture represents great contributions of the Vishwakarmis. Tradition says that the Vishwakarmi castes are subdivided according to the names of their sons. The sons of Lord Vishwakarma were Manu, Maya, Thwastha, Silpi and Vishvajnya. People belonging to the Manu cast are blacksmiths; those of the Manu group are carpenters. The metal craftsmen are known as Thwastha and those who are goldsmiths are called by the name Vishyajnya. The Vishwakarmi castes have been subdivided into five gotras each corresponding to the name of a Rishi which has been mentioned in the Yajur Veda. The five gotras of the Vishwakarmi are Sanagasya Manu, Sanatanasya Maya, Abhuvanasya Tvashta, Pratanansya SiIpi and Suparnasya Vishvajna. The five gotras of the Vishwakarmis are again subdivided into 25 sub-clans. Transportation=Road The Kalika Devi temple at Sirsangi is 62 km from Dharwad and is on the Dharwad‚ÄìBijapur route.

Although woodblock-printed books from Chinese Buddhist temples were seen in Japan as early as the 8th century, the Hyakumant≈ç Darani are the earliest surviving examples of printing in Japan and, alongside the Korean Dharani Sutra, are considered to be some of the world's oldest extant printed matter. Manufacture The production of the Hyakumant≈ç Darani was a huge undertaking. In the year of her resumption of the throne, 764, the Empress Sh≈çtoku commissioned the one million small wooden pagodas (), each containing a small piece of paper (typically 6 x 45 cm) printed with a Buddhist text, the Vimalasuddhaprabhasa mahadharani sutra (Mukuj√¥k√¥ daidarani ky√¥ = The Sutra of the Great Incantations of Undefiled Pure Light = Vimalasuddhaprabhasa Mahadharani Suttra). It is thought they were printed in Nara, where the facilities, craftsmen and skills existed to undertake such large scale production. Marks on the bases of the wooden pagodas indicate that they were worked on lathes and studies of these have identified that more than 100 different lathes were used in their production. More than 45,000 pagodas and 3,962 printed dharani survive in the H≈çry≈´-ji temple near Nara, but globally less than 50,000 pagodas are known to still exist. Their creation was completed around 770, and they were distributed to temples around the country. Historical context There are various theories around Sh≈çtoku's motives for commissioning the Hyakumant≈ç Darani. One is that of remorse and thanksgiving for the suppression of the Emi Rebellion of 764, and another is as an assertion of power and control over resources, but the act could equally serve both political and devotional aims. Either it was felt that printing as a technology had served its ritual purpose through the creation of the Hyakumant≈ç Darani, or simply that the cost of this mass production proved prohibitive, but printing technology did not become widespread until the tenth century and the production, and distribution of books continued to rely heavily on hand-copying manuscripts.

As the son of Hall of Fame legend Ted Whitten Sr., Whitten was in the media spotlight from a very young age and was expected to achieve big things and follow in the footsteps of his father. As a youngster in junior leagues, he was put on a heavy tag, solely due to his name. Whitten made his debut in 1974 at his father's club Footscray, but was only recruited after rumours circulated that he was considering joining rival team South Melbourne. In 1974 Whitten made his VFL debut at 17 years of age, and while he could not live up to the high standards set by one of the greatest footballers of all-time in his father, Whitten turned out to be a very good player. He represented Victoria in State of Origin and went on to play 144 games and kick 133 goals between 1974 and 1982. His career was terminated in the 1982 season after he suffered a terrible anterior cruciate ligament injury. In later years, Whitten helped set up the EJ Whitten Legends Game, a charity football match which raises funds for prostate cancer research. (His father died from prostate cancer).

Over a short period of time, he acquired a reputable position as a religious scholar of Sufism among other subjects.Ali Abbasi, Shahid. (2008, January‚ÄìMarch)Rethinking in Islam: Mawlana Ashraf 'Ali Thanawi on Way and Way- faring. Hamdard Islamic-us, 21(1), 7‚Äì23. (Article on Ashraf 'Ali's teachings on Sufism.) His teaching attracted numerous students and his research and publications became well known in Islamic institutions. During these years, he traveled to various cities and villages, delivering lectures in the hope of reforming people. Printed versions of his lectures and discourses usually became available shortly after these tours. Until then, few Islamic scholars had had their lectures printed and widely circulated in their own lifetimes. The desire to reform the masses intensified in him during his stay at Kanpur. Eventually, Thanwi retired from teaching and devoted himself to reestablishing the spiritual centre (khƒÅnqƒÅh) of his mentor, Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, in ThƒÅna BhƒÅwan, UP, India. Opposition by Barelvis In 1906, Ahmad Raza Khan and other scholars issued a fatwa against Thanwi and other Deobandi leaders entitled Husam ul-Haramain (), calling them unbelievers and Satanists.'Arabic Fatwa against Deobandis' Sufi Manzil website, Published 3 May 2010, Retrieved 11 August 2020Ahmad Raza Khan. Hussam-ul-HarmainFatawa Hussam-ul-Hermayn by Khan, Ahmad Raza QadriAs-samare-ul-Hindiya by Khan, Hashmat Ali Deobandi elders, including those accused in the Fatwa, prepared a reply to questions sent to them by the scholars of Hijaz to clarify the matter. Thus, Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri's al-Muhannad 'ala al-Mufannad (The Sword on the Disproved), was written in Arabic and signed by all Deobandi scholars including Ashraf Ali Thanvi. Upon seeing the clarification, the scholars of Hijaz retracted their approval of Ahmed Raza Khan's Fatwa which was published at the end of the aforementioned Al Muhannad. Thanwi's disciple Murtaza Hasan Chandpuri also wrote articles and leaflets in defence of Thanwi.  Teachings  Ashraf Ali Thanvi stressed on adopting the complete way of Islam to attain salvation. He shunned those Sufis who stressed on voluntary worshiping but neglected other important commandments of Islam including fair dealings and fulfilling the rights of others. Thus his stress would be more on the basic personal reformation and the prescription of Wazaif would come later. At times, he would caution and stress towards matter that are generally thought to be not related to Islam and spirituality but he would explain the forgotten and ignored link. For example, once he stressed the son of his close disciple, Mufti Muhammad Shafi, to improve his handwriting so that others may read it with ease. Thereafter, he remarked that he was nurturing him to become a 'Sufi' by stressing upon this matter (since being mindful of other's comfort was central to his teachings of Sufism). Political ideology Ashraf Ali Thanvi was a strong supporter of the Muslim League. He maintained a correspondence with the leadership of All India Muslim League (AIML), including Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He also sent groups of Ulama to give religious advice and reminders to Mr. Jinnah. He and his pupils gave their entire support to the demand for the creation of Pakistan. During the 1940s, many Deobandi ulama supported the Congress but Ashraf Ali Thanvi and some other leading Deobandi scholars including Muhammad Shafi and Shabbir Ahmad Usmani were in favour of the Muslim League. Thanvi resigned from Deoband's management committee due to its pro-Congress stance. His support and the support of his disciples for Pakistan Movement were greatly appreciated by the leadership of AIML. This can be gauged from the fact that Pakistan became independent, its first flag hoisting in West Pakistan was done by Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani in the presence of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Liaqat Ali Khan; while in East Pakistan, it was done by Allama Zafar Ahmad Usmani in the presence of Khwaja Nazimuddin. Literary works Thanwi authored 345 books and booklets, while the collections of his speeches exceed 300. The total numbers of publications attributed to him (i.e. his own writings and the transcription of his speeches and anecdotes and his letters) are said to cross over 1000. Some of his publications in English include: *The wisdom behind the commands of Islam * Bayan Ul Quran *Perfecting women *The principles and codes of law in Hanafi Fiqh *Answer to modernism *Remedies from the Holy Qur ºaan : an abridged translation of A ºmaale Qur ºaani *Maulana Thanwi's stories of saints : translation, Qisasul akbir *Philosophy of Islam *The objective distinction between the desirable and the dreadful *Deed & retribution : an Islamic approach to the question *Islam the whole truth *Desire for the Aa-khirah *A Remedy for droughts and calamities  Legacy  His Fatwas and religious teachings were thought to be very authoritative even by many of his opponents. Thus many of his contemporaries also sought his advice and held him in high esteem. For example, when the Indian scholar, historian and linguist, Sayyid Sulaiman Nadwi, wished to seek Islamic spirituality, he went to Thana Bhawan. Another Indian scholar, Abdul Majid Dariyabadi, did the same. Even Muhammad Iqbal once wrote to a friend of his that on the matter of Rumi's teachings, he held Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi as the greatest living authority.Maqalat-e- Iqbal; Compiled by Syed Abdul Wahid Mueeni Pakistani scholar Muhammad Ishaq Multani has written a 10 volume encyclopaedia about the history of Thanwi's reform works. It also includes biographies and works done by the disciples of Thanwi up to four generations. Contemporary scholars like Mufti Taqi Usmani have written words of praise for this encyclopaedia.https://taleefat.com/index.php?route=product/product&product;_id=146&tag;=Karwan- mujaddid-thanvi-RAAshraf Ali Thanwi book on quranwahadith.com website Retrieved 11 August 2020 See also *Deobandi * Bahishti Zewar * Aziz al- Hasan Ghouri ReferencesFurther reading * Zaman, Muhammad Qasim, Ashraf \`Ali Thanawi: Islam in Modern South Asia (Makers of the Muslim World), Oneworld, 2007. * Ahmed, Muniruddin, External links *Collection of Ashraf Ali Thanwi in PDF-format Category:Indian Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:1863 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Deobandis Category:Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama Category:19th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:People of British India Category:People from Shamli district Category:Darul Uloom Deoband alumni Category:Leaders of the Pakistan Movement ","title":"Ashraf Ali Thanwi"},{"id":"3567240","text":"Godachi is a pilgrim centre located near Ramdurg Taluk, Belgaum district, in the Indian State of Karnataka.
