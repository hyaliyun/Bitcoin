It was designed by Sir John Rennie as part of the River Ancholme Drainage Scheme, completed in 1836, and is a Grade II* listed building. History and description The River Ancholme rises south of Bishopbridge in Lincolnshire, flows northwards through the town of Brigg and the Ancholme Level, an area of fenland, and enters the Humber at Ferriby Sluice. Attempts were made to drain the wetland and improve the navigability of the river as early as the 13th century, and in the 1630s Sir John Monson constructed the first sluice gates near South Ferriby and a new straight channel, the Ancholme Navigation, to drain the Level and protect the town of Brigg from flooding. A 1767 Act of Parliament authorised works towards \\"the more effectual draining the Lands lying in the Level of Ancholme\\" and making the river navigable as high as Bishopbridge, to be financed by a land tax and the imposition of tolls on goods carried. Two further Acts followed to enlarge the powers of the first. Under the 1825 Act, Sir John Rennie proposed the New River Ancholme Drainage Scheme, by which the navigation, or New River Ancholme, was straightened, widened and deepened, existing small bridges with many arches were replaced by single-span structures, and the locks at Ferriby Sluice were enlarged. Horkstow Bridge, the only suspension bridge designed by Rennie, is one of several bridges built as part of that project. The ironwork was supplied by Messrs John and Edward Walker of Gospel Oak Ironworks, Tipton, Staffordshire, and the bridge was completed in 1836 under the supervision of site engineer Adam Smith. At each end of the bridge are rusticated stone piers in the form of towers which form archways above the road. The single span measures from centre to centre of the masonry towers and the entrance to the bridge deck through the archways is wide. The deck is wide between the rails, surfaced with wooden planks, supported by timber crossbeams suspended from double wrought-iron chains, and is distinctly arched. At normal water levels there is clearance beneath the bridge. It is about upstream from Ferriby Sluice and links the villages of Horkstow, east of the river, and Winterton on the west. A ferry had previously connected the villages, and it is believed a bridge had occupied the site from the 18th century, providing access to the brick-making kilns located on the Winterton side. The bridge is open to vehicles, but movement can be felt even under pedestrian traffic. It can be approached from the east via Bridge Lane, a narrow road which leaves the B1204 just north of Horkstow, but on the west bank only a dirt track remains. Horkstow is one of \\"only a handful\\" of early suspension bridges in Britain to remain as originally designed, but it has not survived completely unscathed. In 1979, repairs were needed after the tractor unit of a 23-ton articulated lorry fell through into the river, destroying a quarter of the bridge deck and damaging the attached suspension rods, though the rest of the structure remained intact. In the 1990s, the bridge was strengthened - the deck relaid using a tropical hardwood timber to support a 5 t load and the underground parts of the suspension chains replaced with high-tensile bars - while retaining its appearance and functionality. The works earned engineers C Spencer Ltd a commendation in the 1999 Institution of Civil Engineers Historic Bridge Awards. Although open to motor traffic, it is mostly used by ramblers, cyclists and anglers. It is owned by the Environment Agency, and in September 1979 was listed at Grade II*, a grading which covers \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". The site of the former brickyard is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest.

It spanned centuries, and consisted of efforts by numerous people and expeditions from various foreign countries to map the continent. See also the European colonization of the Americas. Pre-Columbian exploration According to the Sagas of Icelanders, Norse sailors (often called Vikings) from Iceland first settled Greenland in the 980s. Erik the Red explored and settled southwestern Greenland, which he named to entice potential Icelandic settlers, eventually establishing the Eastern and Western Settlements, which were abandoned around 1350. L'Anse aux Meadows, an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, and a second site in southwestern Newfoundland, are the only known sites of a Norse village in North America outside of Greenland. These sites are notable for their possible connections with the attempted colony of Vinland established by Leif Erikson in 1003. Age of Discovery and the search for the Northwest Passage The Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the Old World, and Europeans remained unaware of the existence of the Americas as a whole, until the first decades following the year 1492. Many expeditions were launched from European nations in search of a Northwest Passage to East Asia (or \\"the Indies\\" as the region was called) in order to establish a shorter trade route to China than the Silk Road, a trade route which had become desperately needed and yet exacerbated by the Fall of Constantinople. Also, the Castilian crown needed an alternative to the Portuguese controlled eastern maritime trade route around Africa to India and East Asia. On August 3, 1492, the italian navigator Christopher Columbus set sail from the Port of Palos de la Frontera in the Province of Huelva, from the newly los Reyes Cat√≥licos coordinated Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, in present-day Spain, financed by Queen Isabella I of Castille. Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage of his discovery of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola spread the news across Europe quickly. Columbus rediscovered and explored much of the Lesser Antilles in his second voyage then discovered both Trinidad and Tobago on his third voyage whilst skirting the northern South American coast. His fourth voyage was spent scanning the Central American coast. The Voyages of Christopher Columbus opened the New World. Italian navigator and explorer Giovanni Caboto (known in English as John Cabot) is credited with the discovery of continental North America on June 24, 1497, under the commission of Henry VII of England. Though the exact location of his discovery remains disputed, the Canadian and United Kingdom governments' official position is that he landed on the island of Newfoundland. The English presence through Giovanni Caboto was signaled in Juan de la Cosa's map of 1500. In 1499 Jo√£o Fernandes Lavrador was licensed by the King of Manuel I of Portugal and together with P√™ro de Barcelos they reached Greenland and sighted Labrador for the first time since Leif Erikson, which was granted and named after Lavrador. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England. Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 the brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte Real explored and named the coasts of Greenland, Labrador and also Newfoundland, naming \\"Terra Verde\\" the explored North American coasts. Both explorations were signaled in 1502 Cantino planisphere. It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia, but rather found what was to Europeans a New World, which in 1507 was named \\"America\\", probably after Amerigo Vespucci, on the Waldseem√ºller map. Further nautical explorations In 1500, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral was sent by Portugal to explore South America. He is considered to be the discoverer of Brazil. Aragon King Ferdinand II sent Juan Ponce de Le√≥n from the fledgling colony on Hispaniola to verify rumors of undiscovered land to the northwest. On April 2, 1513, Ponce de Le√≥n disembarked on the northeast coast of what he named Florida for the crown. The exact location is disputed, but historians have offered the possibilities of St. Augustine, Ponce de Le√≥n Inlet, and Melbourne Beach. He encountered the powerful Gulf Stream and found a passage through the Florida Keys to land on the southwestern Gulf Coast of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. Again, the exact location is disputed. While it is true that Columbus visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1493, Ponce de Leon was the first known European to reach the present-day United States mainland. On September 25, 1513, Spanish conquistador Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean once he crossed the Isthmus of Panama. He claimed all the territory touching it for the Crown, later to affect colonization of Las Californias. Around 1519-1521, Portuguese explorer Jo√£o √Ålvares Fagundes explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and Nova Scotia, with a mission to create colonies. In 1521, Juan Ponce de Le√≥n attempted to establish a permanent settlement on the west coast of Florida. The landing place has not been determined. His expedition was repulsed by natives. Ponce de Le√≥n was struck by an arrow and died of his wounds. In 1524, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed for King Francis I of France and is known as the first European since the Norse to explore the Atlantic coast of North America. Arriving near the Cape Fear River delta, he explored the coastlines of present-day states of South Carolina and North Carolina, entering the Pamlico Sound, and bypassing entrances to the Chesapeake Bay. Believing the New York Harbor to be a lake, he sailed past Long Island, exploring Narragansett Bay and Newfoundland. In 1524-1525, Portuguese explorer Estev√£o Gomes, on behalf of Charles I of Spain, explored present-day Nova Scotia sailing South along the Maine coast. Gomes entered New York Harbor and saw the Hudson River (which he named the \\"San Antonio River\\"). Because of his expedition, the 1529 Diogo Ribeiro world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. In 1528, P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez, who had been named adelantado (governor) of La Florida by Carlos I, the King of Spain, landed in Boca Ciega Bay on the west coast of Florida to begin the ill-fated land expedition of 300 men, of which only four survived. One survivor, √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, wrote the Relaci√≥n, his book of the eight-year survival journey, on his return to Spain. , 3 vols. In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gasp√© Peninsula on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. In 1535 Cartier explored the St. Lawrence river and also claimed the region for France. Map of Hudson's voyages to North America. After two failed attempts to reach East Asia by circumnavigating Siberia, Henry Hudson sailed west in 1609 under the Dutch East India Company. He, too, passed Cape Cod, Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware Bay, instead sailing up the Hudson River on September 11, 1609 in search of a fabled connection to the Pacific via what was actually the Great Lakes. In Hudson's fourth and final voyage, he discovered, mapped, and explored the Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay and James Bay. Other major sea-based explorers were Captain James Cook, George Vancouver, and Charles Wilkes. Overland exploration of the West=16th to 17th centuries There were numerous Spanish explorers and conquistadors who explored the Southwest of North America (including present- day west and central United States) and cross the continent (east to west) in its southern regions, mainly from the second quarter to the middle of the 16th century, such as √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca and Francisco V√°squez de Coronado, but also the North American Southeast and south-central regions. While Spain‚Äôs Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo laid claim to the Pacific Coast of California in the mid 1500s, the earliest land expedition by the Portol√† expedition two hundred years later established Catholic missions from Spanish-controlled Baja California northward. Map of the North-West Territory of the Province of Canada, stretching from the Fraser River on the west to Lake Superior on the east. By David Thompson, 1814. In 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, which would become the first permanent settlement and the capital of New France. He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior. Champlain himself discovered Lake Champlain in 1609. By 1615, he had travelled by canoe up the Ottawa River through Lake Nipissing and Georgian Bay to the centre of Huron country near Lake Simcoe. During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result, the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts. From 1679 to 1682 Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire course of Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. From 1697 to 1702 Eusebio Kino explored the Sonoran Desert and on his journey to the Colorado River Delta discovered an overland route to Baja California that was then commonly believed to be an island. In 1683 Kino lead the first European overland crossing of Baja California. European exploration of western Canada was largely motivated by the fur trade and the search for the elusive Northwest Passage. Hudson's Bay Company explorer Henry Kelsey has the distinction of being the first European to see the northern Great Plains in 1690. 18th century Anthony Henday was the first to have seen the Rocky Mountains, in 1754, but curiously did not mention it in his journals. From his westernmost geographic position (roughly near the town of Olds, Alberta, halfway between Calgary and Red Deer, Alberta) the Rockies should have been quite conspicuous, but he was likely trying to disguise the disappointing fact that an unknown range of seemingly impassible mountains now stood between the HBC and the Pacific. Samuel Hearne found the Coppermine River in 1769-71 in his failed search for copper ore deposits. Disillusioned by these shortfalls, the HBC largely quit exploration. The North West Company, on the other hand, used a business model that required constant expansion into untapped areas. Under the auspices of the NWC, Alexander Mackenzie discovered the Mackenzie River in 1789 and was the first European to reach the North-American Pacific overland, via the Bella Coola River, in 1793. Simon Fraser reached the Pacific in 1808 via the Fraser River. David Thompson, widely regarded as the greatest land geographer that ever lived, traveled over 90,000 km during his lifetime. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the Jay Treaty between Great Britain and the United States. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of from Grand Portage, through Lake Winnipeg, to the headwaters of the Assiniboine and Mississippi Rivers, as well as two sides of Lake Superior.Aritha Van Herk, Travels with Charlotte, Canadian Geographic Magazine, July/August 2007 In 1798, the company sent him to Red Deer Lake (in present-day Alberta) to establish a trading post. The English translation of Lac La Biche-Red Deer Lake-first appeared on the Mackenzie map of 1793. Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the Rocky Mountains. In 1811/1812 he followed the Columbia River to the Pacific, and in 1814 used his notes and measurements to draft the first European-style map of western Canada, covering 3.9 million square kilometres. 19th century to present Lewis and Clark were the first Americans to venture into the newly acquired territory of the Louisiana Purchase, at the order of President Thomas Jefferson. They discovered many new geographical features, Indian tribes, and animal and plant species. John Colter was a member of the expedition who subsequently became a guide for others in the 'Old West,' and did some explorations of his own. John C. Fr√©mont led many important explorations in the Great Plains, Great Basin, Oregon territory, and Mexican Alta California. Joseph Reddeford Walker was one of the most prominent of the explorers, and charted many new paths through the West, which often were then utilized by emigrants crossing to settle in Western towns and communities. In 1833, his exploring party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada following the Carson River and descending via Stanislaus River drainages to Monterey. His return route across the southern Sierra was via Walker Pass, named after Walker by John Charles Fremont. The approach of the Sierra via the Carson River route later became known as the California Trail, the primary route for the emigrants to the gold fields during the California gold rush. As the American population of the West increased, the US government launched ongoing official explorations mainly through the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. One of the main officers and explorers in this unit was George Wheeler. In 1872, the US Congress authorized an ambitious plan to map the portion of the United States west of the 100th meridian at a scale of 8 miles to the inch. This plan necessitated what became known as the Wheeler Survey, along with the Clarence King and John Wesley Powell Surveys, and expeditions by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. In 1879, all such efforts were reorganized as the United States Geological Survey.

County There are 10 counties in the state of New Hampshire responsible for local sheriff services, nursing homes, and prisons. A county is governed by a board of county commissioners. Similar to the rest of New England, county government in New Hampshire is very weak and have relatively few responsibilities compared to states in other regions. Most local government functions are performed at the town and city level. School districtMunicipal New Hampshire contains 234 incorporated towns and cities. Thirteen are cities and 221 are towns. Towns and cities are treated identically under state law. The primary difference is that cities are former towns who dropped the town meeting form of government in favor of a city form through special act of the New Hampshire General Court. Since 1979, however, any town or city can change its form of government by creation of a new charter and voter approval of the new municipal charter. Cities and towns are nominally divisions of the state. However, as in the rest of New England, the laws governing their authority are very broadly construed. Collectively, these 234 municipalities cover the vast majority of, but not all of, the state's territory. There are some unincorporated areas in the sparsely populated northern region of the state. Most of the unincorporated areas are in Coos County, the state's northernmost county. Carroll and Grafton counties also contain small amounts of unincorporated territory. This territory includes seven unincorporated townships and an assortment of gores, grants, purchases and locations. The remaining seven counties in the state are entirely incorporated (Grafton County was also fully incorporated at one time, but lost that status when one of its towns disincorporated). Fewer than 250 of the state's residents live in unincorporated areas. * The largest municipality in New Hampshire, by population (as of the 2010 census), is the city of Manchester (pop. 109,565). * The largest which is a town and not a city is Derry (pop. 33,109). * The smallest which is a city and not a town is Franklin (pop. 8,477). * The smallest incorporated municipality overall is the town of Hart's Location (pop. 41). * The largest municipality by land area is the town of Pittsburg (). * The smallest is the town of New Castle ().

Plot The player character is an Allied soldier whose orders are to infiltrate the top-secret Nazi fortress called the Eagle's Nest (which consists of four castles), rescue three Allied saboteurs being held there, save art treasures the Nazis have stolen, and then destroy the Nest with explosives. Gameplay A joystick is required for control, and the player depresses the firing button to fire the machine gun, which carries enough ammunition for 99 shots. Nazis require two well-placed shots to eliminate, and Nazis sitting at a table only require one well-placed shot. The player can sustain up to 50 shots from enemy soldiers. While inside the castles, the player finds crates which may contain art objects or explosives. The player can also find ammunition dumps, first-aid kits, and goods in the castles. Release The game was originally programmed by Andrew Challis for the Commodore 64, and by Kevin Parker for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and ZX Spectrum platforms, with graphics provided by Robin Chapman for all formats. It was initially released in 1987 by Pandora in the United Kingdom. The game was also licensed by Mindscape for release in the United States, who handled the Apple II port by Andrew Pines and IBM PC port by Visionware Inc. In 1988 Atari Corporation published a cartridge version for the Atari 8-bit family as part of the Atari XEGS release line-up. Reception Compute! called Into the Eagle's Nest \\"a good, solid arcade game\\" but criticized it for not allowing save games during most of the game, and stated that receiving points for killing drunken, unconscious Nazi soldiers seemed like \\"cold-blooded murder\\". The game was reviewed in 1987 in Dragon #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers game the game 4 out of 5 stars. A 1991 Computer Gaming World survey of strategy and war games gave it two and a half stars out of five, stating that it was \\"fun for a short time, but rapidly loses its interest appeal\\".

It was constructed in 2000 to include Bothriceps australis and the superfamily Brachyopoidea. It is phylogenetically defined as a stem-based taxon including Pelorocephalus and all taxa closer to it than to Rhytidosteus. In contrast, Brachyopoidea is defined as a node-based taxon including Brachyops and Pelorocephalus and all descendants of their most recent common ancestor. Because Bothriceps is not thought to be a descendant of that recent common ancestor and would be more basal than it, the genus is placed just outside Brachyopoidea and is considered to be a sister taxon to the clade. Bothriceps was once considered to be a brachyopid within Brachyopoidea, but is now placed on the brachyopoid stem closer to Brachyopoidea than to Rhytidosteidae due to the presence of several plesiomorphies (ancestral characters). The probable presence of a tabular horn in Bothriceps also suggests that it is a basal brachyopomorph rather than a brachyopid. Keratobrachyops, once assigned to Chigutisauridae, is now thought to be a basal brachyopomorph closely related to Bothriceps.

It was broadcast between 1982 and 2007, and played a role in overturning the convictions of 18 people involved in 13 separate cases where miscarriages of justice had occurred. The programme was similar in aim and approach to The Court of Last Resort, the NBC TV programme that aired in the United States between 1957 and 1958. It is credited with contributing to the establishment of the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 1997. Rough Justice was cancelled in 2007 due to budget restraints, leading to criticism from the media as the announcement came just as the BBC launched an ¬£18 million Gaelic-language channel which would serve only 86,000 viewers. Origins The programme was devised and produced by Peter Hill, an investigative journalist, in 1979, motivated by Ludovic Kennedy's earlier television work in the same field and the work of Tom Sargant at reform group JUSTICE. In 1992 Hill recalled: \\"At that time there were equally important programmes being made by John Willis at Yorkshire Television and Ray Fitzwater at Granada. We were all investigating mistakes made before a case comes to trial. That was the problem in the early eighties - the legacy of police misconduct from the seventies.\\" During this period, criminal justice procedure in the United Kingdom was uncodified. Until the introduction of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), and the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, the police \\"decided what evidence to disclose.\\" Following the introduction of PACE, David Jessel, a later reporter on the programme, acknowledged that the Act had \\"probably reduced police misconduct\\" but said that \\"the evidence of a plethora of post- PACE case papers is that the same old wickednesses continue, although in different guises. It is remarkable how many suspects these days \\"confess\\" in police cars on their way to PACE-protected police stations; and duty solicitors have tales to tell about the co-operation afforded them at some stations.\\" Format Each programme concentrated on a separate case where a miscarriage of justice was alleged to have taken place. The first, titled The Case of the Handful of Hair, was broadcast on BBC1 on 7 April 1982, and concerned a 1976 murder case. It was watched by 11 million viewers. Cancellation The programme was cancelled by the BBC in November 2007 as a cost-cutting measure. Marcel Berlins, writing in The Guardian, pointed out that the \\"effort and care which went into the programme's investigations\\" frequently \\"uncovered basic flaws in our system of investigating crime, exposed police incompetence and revealed the shortcomings of forensic science.\\" It was this effort, Berlins believed, and the high financial cost that it entailed, that led to the BBC decision that \\"the crass value-for-money criterion was not being fulfilled. Yet Rough Justice is a perfect example of what public service broadcasting, which the BBC is supposed to espouse, is all about.\\" Simon Ford, who had worked as the programme's executive producer, said: \\"For 27 years (sic), a programme like Rough Justice has proved that television, as well as reporting on injustice, can actually change things. Without a dedicated team doing that, many individuals who are wrongly imprisoned will stay there and the British public will remain ignorant of the failings of our justice system. This is a tragedy for the prisoners themselves and our greater society.\\" The BBC was also criticised for cancelling the programme while spending ¬£18 million to launch a Gaelic-language channel \\"aimed at only 86,000, mainly Scottish, viewers, a population the size of Crawley, [West Sussex].\\" Programmes *1982 **The Case of the Handful of Hair (first broadcast 7 April 1982) - reinvestigation of the conviction of Mervyn \\"Jock\\" Russell for the murder of Jane Bigwood in Deptford, London, in 1976. **The Case of the Thin-bladed Knife (first broadcast 14 April 1982) - reinvestigation of the conviction of father and son Michael and Patrick McDonagh for the murder of Francis McDonagh in Moss Side, Manchester. **The Case of Little Boy Blue (21 April 1982) - reinvestigation of the 1973 conviction of John Walters for sexual assaulting Roselyne Auffret on a train travelling from Wimbledon station to London Waterloo station.

Written by Dwight Cummins and Dorothy Yost, the film is about a cowboy who protects a young man wrongly accused of murder, while trying to find the real badguys. Plot Following the death of his friend Ed Norton who was killed during a dice game, Gene Autry (Gene Autry) sets out in search of the killer. His search takes him to an old house where Larry Evans (Russell Arms), who was accused of the murder, is in hiding. Larry's sister Mary (Barbara Britton) defends her brother, claiming they both loved Ed, who acted as their guardian after the death of their father. Mary is able to convince Gene that Larry is innocent. Gene offers to help him evade the sheriff until he can discover the real killer. Later, Gene discovers that Larry's gun, which was used in the killing, was offered as collateral during the dice game, and anyone could have taken it and shot Ed when the lights in the room went out. To allude a posse, Gene takes Larry to a cabin belonging to his prospector friend, Jim Hedge (Clem Bevans). When Gene questions him about the game, Larry tells him that either Dave Randall (Jack Holt) or Don Mason (Robert Shayne), who were both playing in the game, suggested that he put up the gun. Gene rides back into town to continue his search for the real killer. Meanwhile, Mason offers to purchase the Evans ranch from Mary and help Larry to escape across the border. Gene overhears the conversation and is surprised by the large amount of money Mason is proposing to pay for the property. When Gene returns to Jim's cabin, he is followed by the sheriff. Although Gene manages to warn Larry of the lawman's presence, Larry is convinced that Gene has betrayed him. The following morning, Gene and Jim ride to the ranch where Larry is hiding. After a struggle, Larry realizes that Gene is on his side. Gene notices that Jim's compass is behaving strangely. He sets a trap for the killers and exposes Don Mason and his cohorts, Bill Otis and Dave Randall, who murdered Ed Norton in order to obtain the rich lode of iron ore on his ranch. Larry's name cleared, and he and his sister return to their ranch and its valuable iron ore.

Many bandolero car drivers move into Legends racing. Cars can reach in excess of 70 mph, but do not accelerate very quickly. The most wins in Bandolero race cars used to be held by Joey Logano but was broken in 2016 by Clay Thompson. The cars are built like miniature stock cars, with a tube frame and sheet metal cage. Drivers enter through the roof of the vehicle. Most drivers range from 8 to 14 years old, but older drivers can also race. The cars race on 1/4 mile, 3/8 mile and 4/10 mile ovals and also road courses and dirt tracks. Currently, there are two divisions in Bandolero racing. History Bandolero cars were introduced by US Legends Cars (formerly 600 Racing, Inc.), the makers of legends cars, in 1997 to be a series of entry-level cars. The Bandolero car is a turnkey, spec-series racer designed for drivers as young as eight years old. The term bandolero is Spanish for 'bandit', 'outlaw', or 'thief'. \\"We wanted something to go between a kart and a car and wanted to make it relatively simple for everybody to use,\\" said US Legends Cars found H.A. \\"Humpy\\" Wheeler. \\"For example, like a kart, the Bandolero Car has left-foot braking and a centrifugal clutch so there's no shifting of gears for a new driver to worry about. Simplicity and economy of design are evident everywhere, with 150 parts making up the entire package‚Äìjust half of what goes into making a Legends Car.\\" The Bandolero car engine is a Briggs & Stratton 570cc Vanguard engine mounted behind the driver.

Alum Creek Cemetery Location Alum Creek is located about four miles southeast of Bastrop, Texas, where TX-71 crosses Alum Creek.  History  Alum Creek was founded in 1829, one of the oldest communities in the county. Members of the Cottle, Highsmith, Craft, Parker, Grimes, Ridgeway, and White families( from Stephen F. Austin's lower colonies) built a fort for protection against Native Americans near the mouth of the community's namesake creek. With the families locating cabins and farms nearby, the town expanded enough to have a private school in 1835 and land deeded for a campground and meetinghouse in 1846. The latter was previously owned by James Craft. It is believed that an Alum Creek post office was established in 1851, but there is no record with the USPS of such an establishment. By 1853, a local Methodist Episcopal church had been formed. Alum Creek's population of 200 in 1884 supported three mills, two general stores, a blacksmith, and a saloon. This boom ended abruptly and by 1896, the population dipped to 40. Though a school continued to exist in Alum Creek until 1937, the community failed to maintain enough of a population to be included in twentieth century population estimates and census counts.  Current  At the 2000 census, the population of Alum Creek was seventy. Today, Alum Creek sustains several businesses, including A Place For Your Stuff portable building manufacturer and an unspecified store called Clutterbugs.

The Chinese established the Lhasa Brewery Company in 1988, which is located in Lhasa. It is the highest brewery in the world. History The first historical record of beer in Tibet are Chinese, concerning a 638 peace agreement between Tang China and the new Tibetan kingdom of Songtsen Gampo include the technological transfers of silk, paper, watermill and beer production. Tang Taizong did not respect the agreement on these technical transfer, but his son, Tang Gaozong, did.. However, somewhat contradicting the fact that alcohol is contrary to the beliefs of Tibetan Buddhism, is the fact that for centuries, chhaang, a local brew of barley sold by glass at street stalls in Lhasa and across towns in Tibet has been consumed by many Tibetans and monks. In the countryside of Tibet and Nepal, Raksi, a traditional distilled alcoholic beverage usually made from kodo or millet is often preferred, and despite the general prohibitive beliefs towards alcohol in Tibetan Buddhism, traditionally Raksi is often a requirement to accompany other foods at marriage ceremonies and festivals. The rebellious 6th Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, enjoyed a lifestyle that included drinking wine on the streets of Lhasa, the company of women, and writing love songs.Alexandra David-Neel, Initiation and Initiates in Tibet, trans. by Fred Rothwell, New York: University Books, 1959Yu Dawchyuan, \\"Love Songs of the Sixth Dalai Lama\\", Academia Sinica Monograph, Series A, No.5, 1930 However, his drinking and irresponsible behaviour was widely frowned upon by the other eminent officials in Tibet and he is believed to have been murdered in 1706 because of his lifestyle.Stein, R. A. (1972). Tibetan Civilization, p. 85. Stanford University Press. (cloth); (paper). Lhasa Brewery Company A large stack of beer bottles at Mindroling Monastery, a stark contrast between traditional beliefs and growing outside influences Factory production of beer in Tibet began in the late 1980s under the influence of the Chinese who legalised formal production and established the Lhasa Brewery in 1988 on the northern outskirts of Lhasa, south of Sera Monastery. The factory was set up with aid and expertise provided by the Romanian government who sent a team to Lhasa in 1988/89.http://www.summersdale.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=50&products;_id=339&osCsid;=au7or25nese09o23obgnj2eno4 Production began in 1989 although this is disputed by some locals. The Lhasa Brewery Company, is the highest commercial brewery in the world at 11,975 feet and accounts for 85% of contemporary beer production in Tibet. The brewery, consisting of five story buildings, cost an estimated US$20‚Äì25 million, and by 1994, production had reached 30,000 bottles per day, employing some 200 workers by this time. The beer produced is typically a light, sweet beer, a preference with many Chinese. However, the factory, financially, is known to have been very poor in its first years and has shut down on numerous occasions because of supply shortages and electrical outages and has suffered from unsanitary conditions. Little beer ever reached towns outside Lhasa because of a poor infrastructure and distribution network, and a distinct lack of a domestic market, due to religious beliefs and poverty. Since 2000, the Carlsberg group has increased its stronghold in the Chinese market and has become increasingly influential in the country with investment and expertise. Carlsberg invested in the Lhasa Brewery in recent years and has drastically improved the brewing facility and working conditions, renovating and expanding the building to what now covers 62,240 square metres (15.3 acres). Carlsberg overlooked the modernization of 10 older machines with 10 new high efficiency European manufactured machines on the production line in November 2007 and has recently spent 1.395 million Yuan on the improvement of production processes to comply with global atmospheric pollution standards. A water purification and reuse system was established to reduce liquid waste production and today the brewery recycles the waste byproducts of spent grain and yeast. Today the brewery has 250 full-time employees and 200 part-time employees, 72% of which are ethnic Tibetans, and 52% women. Lhasa Beer Lhasa Beer is the only Tibetan beer on the world market and has grown in production in recent years through the Lhasa Brewery Company's increasing connections and investment internationally by Carlsberg. It is an all-malt European style lager, but is made from ingredients such as Himalayan spring water, barley, saaz hops and yeast. However, 30 percent of the malt content derives from the huskless native Tibetan barley which is partly responsible for giving the beer its characteristic crisp clean taste, along with the aromatic saaz ingredient. The beer is sold in cans, a 12-ounce bottle in packs of 6, and in 24 bottle cases, with the motto \\"Beer from the Roof of the World\\".

Life He was the third son of Gilbert Ironside the elder, born at Winterbourne Abbas. On 14 November 1650, he matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 4 February 1653, MA on 22 June 1655, BD on 12 October 1664, and DD on 30 June 1666. He became scholar of his college in 1651, fellow in 1656, and was appointed public reader in grammar in 1659, bursar in 1659 and 1661, sub-warden in 1660, and librarian in 1662. He was presented in 1663 to the rectory of Winterbourne Faringdon by Sir John Miller, with which he held from 1666, in succession to his father, the rectory of Winterbourne Steepleton. On the promotion of Walter Blandford to the See of Oxford, he was elected Warden of Wadham College on 7 December 1665, an office which he held for 25 years until his resignation on 7 October 1689. According to Anthony Wood, he was strongly opposed to the high-handed John Fell, and refused to serve as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford during Fell's lifetime. After Fell's death in 1686, he filled the office from 1687 to 1689. When King James II made his visit to Oxford in September 1687 with the aim of compelling Magdalen College to admit his nominee Anthony Farmer as President, in a discussion with the King, Ironside insisted on the fellows' rights. He declined in November an invitation to dine with the King's special commissioners on the evening after they had expelled the fellows of Magdalen. After the Glorious Revolution, Ironside was rewarded for his resistance by being appointed bishop of Bristol; the diocese was poor, and Ironside was consecrated, 13 October 1689, on the understanding that he should be translated to a more lucrative see when opportunity offered. On the death of Herbert Croft, he was transferred to the see of Hereford in July 1691. Near the turn of the century when he was about sixty years of age, according to Wood, Ironside married a widow of Bristol, n√©e Robinson. He died on 27 August 1701, and was buried in the church of St. Mary Somerset, Thames Street, London. On the demolition of that church in 1867, the bishop's remains were transferred to Hereford Cathedral. Works Ironside published, with a short preface, Nicholas Ridley's account of a disputation at Oxford on the sacrament, together with a letter of John Bradford's (Oxford, 1688), and a sermon preached before the king on 23 November 1684 (Oxford, 1685).

It was also known as el Partido del Sol (the Party of the Sun) from its logo which featured a bright orange rising sun.  History  In 1964, Partido Popular Democratico (PPD) candidate Roberto S√°nchez Vilella had become the second governor to be democratically elected in Puerto Rico. The party remained in power until 1968, when Luis A. Ferr√©, of the newly founded Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP), won the elections due to the PDP's big division of 1968. This division was the result of the personal and irreconcilable differences between the PPD's founder, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, and then current governor, Roberto S√°nchez Vilella. Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n had opposed S√°nchez Vilella's attempt to run for reelection and at a party assembly party-founder Mu√±oz Mar√≠n nominated Luis Negr√≥n L√≥pez as his new candidate for governor. The nomination caused a deep division in the PPD prompting S√°nchez Vilella to create a new party, the Partido del Pueblo (People's Party). The new party's motto was \\"que el pueblo decida\\" (\\"let the people decide\\"), a motto clearly directed at Mu√±oz Mar√≠n who denied S√°nchez Vilella of a primary. S√°nchez Vilella ran as candidate for governor under this new party and Negr√≥n L√≥pez ran under the PPD banner. The result was a split among PPD's voters, leading to the first victory by Luis A. Ferr√© of the PNP (Partido Nuevo Progresista) in the 1968 elections and the PPD's defeat in the 1968 general election.

This species was originally described in 1986 by Kurt Hjortstam and Leif Ryvarden, who called it Amethicium luteoincrustatum. They placed it in the genus Amethicium based on microscopic similarities with the African species Amethicium rimosum. Description Cericium luteoincrustatum is a waxy and brittle crust fungus with a fruit body that is about 0.2‚Äì1 mm thick. Its surface is either smooth or somewhat tuberculate with a pale yellow colour. It has a dimitic hyphal system, without clamp connections in the generative hyphae. The hyphae in the subiculum are arboriform (tree-like); these are binding-type hyphae. Cystidia feature yellowish incrustations at their bases. The spores produced by the fungus are smooth and thin-walled with an ellipsoid shape, and measure about 5 by 3 Œºm.

Since April 1969 it has been a Grade II* listed building. Gives details of listed status and architecture. St James is small church which is often referred to as a chapel, in fact it is situated on Chapel Lane. The church is officially dedicated to James the Less and not James the Greater although there has always been some confusion. Some modern historians and clergy maintain that the church should be dedicated to James the Greater as the scallop shells carved above the church door are the traditional emblem of James the Greater. It is possible that it was re-dedicated to James the Less in the Victorian era because of the smallness of the church. The church is in the Parish of Penistone within the Diocese of Wakefield. History The interior showing the gallery and font Origins St James‚Äô church was founded by the Barnby family of Barnby Hall, Cawthorne. Thomas de Barnby, vicar of Kirkheaton, became Lord of the Manor of Midhope in 1337 and was succeeded by his nephew Robert in 1354. Robert de Barnby was the probable founder of the church around the year 1360 although other scholars attribute Thomas de Barnby as the founder at a slightly earlier date.\\"Medieval South Yorkshire\\", David Hey, Page 90 , Says Thomas de Barnby was likely founder of chapel and gives other historical information. The church was built as a Chapel of ease for the main church of the parish of Ecclesfield, St. Marys‚Äô, which lay 14 km to the east. The Barnbys‚Äô used St James‚Äô as their private chapel until 1622 when they were forced to sell the entire manor because of financial hardship brought on by fines levied after the English Reformation for hearing Mass and not attending the state church.\\"Historic Hallamshire\\", David Hey, page 49 , Gives historical information. The church was owned by Puritans between 1622 and 1690 and they installed a Jacobean pulpit which was high enough for the preacher to see out of the window. The pulpit is the present day church‚Äôs most valuable antique. In the second half of the 17th century the chapel fell into disrepair.\\"Church booklet\\", No author or ISBN, Gives most of church‚Äòs history. 1705 restoration The church was restored in 1705 by Godfrey Bosville who became Lord of the Manor in 1690. Bosville undertook a partial rebuilding of the east and west ends and added the porch, Minstrels' gallery, box pews and a bell cupola. Bosville had his coat of arms along with his and his wife Bridget‚Äôs initial carved above the porch door as a sign that he regarded the church as his personal family chapel, a move which upset many local residents. The interior seen from the gallery showing the pulpit and altar. Until 1847 services at St James‚Äô were performed by clergy from the nearby St Mary's Church, Bolsterstone where all records of births, marriages and deaths were kept. After 1847 services were carried out by clergy from Penistone. The bell in the cupola was replaced in 1858 and again 1929, the graveyard was laid out in the 18th century and further extended in 1915.\\"Welcome To St James‚Äò Church, Midhopestones\\", No ISBN, Gives historical information. Modern developments In 1967 a trap door was discovered between the pulpit and the altar by a joiner doing repairs, this led to speculation of an ancient tunnel connecting the church to the old manor house. However no evidence of a tunnel was found and it is now believed that it was a place where the church silver was kept safely in the past. In 1978 renovations took place which included lowering the pulpit to its present height, replacing brass candlesticks and cross with wrought iron ones and the removal of the front box pews and using the oak wood to make inner doors and a desk and chair for the priest. A large ancient stone altar was discovered in the south wall during the 1978 renovations; this is now used as the altar in Saint John the Baptist Church, Penistone.

As Ancient Satafis it was a bishopric, which remains a Catholic titular see. Ain El Kebira is a da√Øra (district, part of a vilayet (province), comprising several municipalities) in the Algerian regional classification.  History  The Romans of Dj√©mila used it for entering their dead. Ancient city Satafis was important enough under Roman rule to become a suffragan bishopric in the Roman province of Mauretania Sitifensis. Inscriptions testify to Christian community cristiana since the early 4th century, including the tomb of local priest Securus. Four historically documented bishops are attributed to this see : * An inscription in 324 names Avianus Crescens * Catholic Adeodatus and his Donatist heretical counterpart Urbanus attended the Council of Carthage held in 411 on that very schism. * Festus intervened at the synod called in the same Carthage by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom in 484, after which he was exiled, like most Catholic bishops. It faded like most in Roman Africa, presumably at the 7th century advent of Islam. The modern city was created in the French colonial time under the name of P√©rigotville.

The generic name Ischnoderma combines the Ancient Greek words (\\"dry\\") and (\\"skin\\"). Chemistry The type species, I. resinosum, is used in mushroom dyeing to produce various shades of brown. It has been shown to efficiently decolorize several structurally different synthetic dyes: amaranth, Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Phthalocyanine Blue BN, and Poly R-478. Ischnoderma benzoinum has antiviral activity against type A influenza virus of birds and humans. Uses Young, fleshy specimens of both I. resinosum and I. benzoinum may be cooked and eaten, but the species become hard and inedible later in life.

During his time in the colonies he made collections of natural history. In 1758 he moved to Holland. Nine months after his return from the Dutch East Indies he moved to London, where he lived for 22 years and interacted with scholarly societies and shared his natural history illustrations and collections. Career=Early years Joan Gideon Loten, born in Groenekan, near Utrecht he was the eldest son of secretary of the waterboard Joan Carel Loten (1669‚Äì1769) and Arnoldina Maria van Aerssen van Juchen (1685‚Äì1775). The Loten family originally came from the Southern Netherlands. Circa 1720 Loten lived with his parents and younger brother Arnout (1719‚Äì1801) in Utrecht. In 1726 he was a student of the Utrecht University. One of his teachers was Pieter van Musschenbroek. In March 1728 he left University and became a clerk of the Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch East India Company. By means of patronage of members of his family Loten was appointed junior merchant of the Company in 1731.  Servant in the Dutch East Indies  In January 1732 he left the Dutch Republic with the East India man Beekvliet and headed to Batavia (Jakarta). On 25 August 1733 he married Anna Henriette van Beaumont (1716‚Äì1755), a member of a prominent family in Batavia (for example, her uncle Isaak Augustijn Rumpf had been Governor of Dutch Ceylon from 1716 to 1723). Eleven years later he was elected Governor of Makassar (Ujung Pandang) (1744‚Äì1750) and in 1752 he became himself Governor of Ceylon (1752‚Äì1757). In 1749 he was elected Councillor of the Dutch East Indies and thus obtained a seat in the government of the Dutch East India Company at Batavia. He was a capable administrator. He was usually respectful of the native population and did not exercise immoderate forms of supremacy. There is nothing to indicate that he pursued personal wealth by means considered improper or ruthless by his contemporaries. Although he was successful in the Dutch East Indies, in later years he became embittered against the Company and the way the Court of directors in Amsterdam and the Government at Batavia treated its former servants.  Back to Europe  In 1758 Loten repatriated as Admiral of the Return Fleet in the Dutch Republic. He returned to his homeland with an estimated fortune of about 700,000 Dutch guilders. Part of this East Indian fortune came from private trading and emoluments resulting from his offices. The majority of his Indian capital came from the legacy of Nathanael Steinmetz, a former governor and director of Amboyna. The capital afforded Loten financial independence during the rest of his life. Once he returned to the Dutch Republic, he felt like an outsider, excluded from the circles of the aristocratic and patrician class and estranged from his orthodox and narrow-minded Utrecht Calvinistic relatives. This led him to travel to England scarcely nine months after his return from the East Indies. Loten lived in London with several interruptions for twenty two years. The city's amusements and cosmopolitan intellectual atmosphere gave him a feeling of freedom. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1760. Although his early efforts to integrate into English society suggest an inclination towards the British way of life, Loten ultimately remained a Dutchman in his tastes and sympathies. This became increasingly prominent during his stay in England. In the 1770s, his feelings towards his British acquaintances, and towards British society in general, changed. After the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War in 1780.In November 1781 he returned to Utrecht. Watercolour by unknown artist of the monument erected in the memory of J .G. Loten in the Westminster Abbey. 25 February 1789 Loten died in his house Cour de Loo at the Utrecht Drift. He was buried in the Utrechts Jacobikerk. In the London Westminster Abbey an impressive monument, made by Thomas Banks, was erected in his memory in 1795 (see illustration).  Loten's contribution to natural history  Loten was well versed in the zoological, astronomical, genealogical and medical literature of his era. Loten's activities as a collector were those of a virtuoso in the sense that his interest in natural phenomena was based purely upon a fascination with exotic nature and its unique and rare components. In Engeland he came in touch with naturalists in the just founded British Museum. He donated watercolours, stuffed birds and mineral stones to the British Museum. Joseph Banks was in Londen Loten's neighbour. Joseph Banks, the later President of the Royal Society, accompanied Captain James Cook as a private naturalist on HMS Endeavour (1768‚Äì1771). Thanks to Banks, the gentleman naturalist Thomas Pennant and 'the father of British ornithology' George Edwards, Loten's natural history collection was copied and described in several 18th-century English natural history books. At present the Loten collection is preserved in the London Natural History Museum, British Library, Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Rijksprentenkabinet in Amsterdam and Nationaal Archief in The Hague. Documents concerning his colonial career are in the national archive in the Hague. Personal memoirs and letters are dispersed over various collections in England and the Netherlands.

All of the Bagwans are converted to Muslims from Hindu community during Mughal empire. History and origin According to some traditions, the Bagban are a branch of the Kunjra community. Baghban literally means gardener in Persian and Urdu languages. The term is exactly the same as the Hindi term Mali, which also means gardener, and is the name of a well known Hindu caste Mali. The Bagban have three sub-divisions, the Kachhi, Murao and Mali suggesting that they are Muslim converts from these three communities. Present circumstances The Bagban are a community of farmers, growing and selling vegetables such as potatoes, onions. Their landholdings are small, and many are sharecroppers. The Bagban are thus distinct from the Kunjra, who are a landless community.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das page 109 The Bagban have a formal community association, the Bagban Mohammadi Imdadi Association (Bagban Muslim Welfare Association). This community association campaigns on behalf of the Bagban community, and has replaced the traditional community council. They are an endogamous community, with all three sub-communities marrying each other.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das page 111 The Bagban are concentrated in the Awadh region, found mainly in the districts of Allahabad, Bahraich, Barabanki, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Lukhnow, Sitapur and Sultanpur. They are found in Maharashtra such as Jalgaon, Bhusawal, Dhule, Malegaon, Ratnagiri, Mumbai, Solapur, Satara, Sanagli, Kolhapur.

In Karnataka such as Wadi Bijapur,Gulbarga, Banglore, Hubli, Gadag etc. They speak Hindi, Urdu,Marathi ,and local lanaguggealso, Awadhi among themselves, and Urdu with members of other communities. Many members of this community migrated to Pakistan in 1947 and have settled in Karachi and Sindh. Bagwan of Deccan The Bagban or Bagwan as they are called in Dakhni are found mainly in the Deccan region, i.e., Maharashtra parts of Andhra Pradesh (mainly Telangana) and Karnataka (North Karnataka). The present day Bagwan community is mostly engaged in trading and act as commission agents and wholesalers and retailers of fruits and vegetables. In some towns of the Deccan they dominate the wholesale trade in fruits and vegetables in the APMC markets. The present-day Bagwan community of Maharashtra is classified as an OBC and accordingly provided reservations in education and government jobs in Maharashtra state.OBC castes in Maharashtra Recently the Bagwan community has taken initiative to spread education in the community in particular and Muslims in general through the Bagban Educational Trust. Ilyas seth bagban Gulbarga has taken this initiative to allow the community children's to be educated and for the betterment of the society There are over 5000 active Bagban members in a Bagwan/Bagban group on Facebook created in 2007.

Illa (also known as E.C. & WhiteFolks) began his recording career in 1990 as a member of The Ill State Assassins, a rap and production group that spawned several successful nationally recognized artists such as Twista, The Legendary Traxster, Toxic and others. After his music began circulating throughout Chicago's inner-city and college radio stations abroad, E.C. Illa started solidifying himself as one of the few well-respected white rap artists of an era in rap history when most non-black rappers were quickly dismissed. Having grown up within Chicago's infamous gang culture, Illa's fluently-street music was able to reach far beyond previous attempts by other white rap artists to be embraced as legitimate or ‚Äúreal.‚Äù E.C.Illa‚Äôs vinyl-only debut was an EP titled ‚ÄúThe Invisible Man‚Äù (1992) released on Mob City Records, an independent label owned by Dirk van den Heuvel, a DJ for Northwestern University's ‚ÄúStreet Beat‚Äù radio show. Mob City records would go on to release Illa's first full-length album titled ‚ÄúIll State of Mind‚Äù (1993), as well as other selected 12‚Äù singles from those releases.  National recognition  In 1994 E.C. Illa's first CD titled ‚ÄúLive From The Ill‚Äù was released on local Chicago label, Wicked Entertainment. The CD was Illa's most successful release to that point selling more than 8,000 copies locally. This success prompted a quick follow-up in 1995 when Wicked Entertainment released E.C.Illa‚Äôs critically acclaimed ‚ÄúIlla LP‚Äù, along with his debut music video for the song ‚ÄúOn Ill.‚Äù The music video for ‚ÄúOn Ill‚Äù was directed by Illa himself, featuring raw footage of Chicago-style graffiti and break dancing. The video became a mainstay on BET's Rap City and the now-defunct BOX ‚ÄúMusic Television You Control‚Äù throughout 1995-96, giving E.C. his first strong showing of national exposure. During this time, Illa was featured on the cover of several publications, including Thrasher Magazine and Urb Magazine. While E.C.‚Äôs self-produced signature sound was considered ‚Äúdirty‚Äù or ‚Äúunderground‚Äù, it captured a cult following that was highly committed to the artist. ‚ÄúIlla LP‚Äù was E.C.‚Äôs first release to reach five-figure sales, bringing opportunities to tour nationally with the likes of Wu Tang Clan, Big L, Cypress Hill and other popular artists of the time, as well as offers of major distribution. By The end of 1996, E.C. Illa entered into a new agreement with nationally distributed Cargo Records / Universal Records (Blink 182, The Roots) for his fifth release titled ‚ÄúPower Moves.‚Äù Illa would also release two volumes of his ‚ÄúVandillism Instrumentals‚Äù series in the interim.  Power Moves  Illa's ‚ÄúPower Moves‚Äù album featured a more-polished production style along with co-production and vocal contributions by fellow crew member The Legendary Traxster. By 1997, Traxster had already produced the gold & platinum debuts of fellow-Chicagoans Twista and Do or Die, causing some of Illa's core- fans to blame the pairing for Illa's straying from his signature sound. The album's first single and video \\"Old School Tactics\\" featured E.C.'s counterpart Rhymefest. Rhymefest (Che Smith) would later win a Grammy for co- writing the song \\"Jesus Walks\\" on Kanye West's debut album \\"The College Dropout.\\" Rhymefest would also go on to win an Oscar for co-penning the song \\"Glory\\" featured in the motion picture Selma. ‚ÄúPower Moves‚Äù was publicized in the Beastie Boys owned Grand Royal magazine and Rap Pages, among other niche periodicals that specialized in the major independent artists of the time. While ‚ÄúPower Moves‚Äù failed to reach the commercial success Illa appeared poised to gain at the time, it did further his appeal within the midwest's gang community, who already embraced his regional hit ‚ÄúWhat You Be About?‚Äù as classic. Cargo Record's Chicago branch would fold a mere 6 months after ‚ÄúPower Moves‚Äù hit store shelves and the album would be out of print roughly a year after its release.  Hiatus  Illa would take the years 1998-2000 to regroup, releasing no albums, but appearing on successful local ‚Äúgangsta‚Äù compilations such as ‚ÄúThe Wicked Streets of Chi‚Äù, \\"Gangsta Boogie\\" and ‚ÄúCWAL Ballaz‚Äù with the likes of other regional legends PsychoDrama, Snypaz and Crucial Conflict . In the year 2000 E.C. Illa opened The Tip CDs & Tapes, a music retail store located on Chicago's North side that specialized in independent Chicago rap. Illa's accessibility as owner of The Tip store allowed him to reemerge as a local celebrity of sorts. In 2001 Illa released the album ‚ÄúNatural Born Illa‚Äù on local Chicago label, A-List Audio. The self- produced collection featuring Planet Asia, Rasco and JUICE among others, would mark the return (and end) of Illa's ‚Äúhardcore hip hop‚Äù signature style, similar to his earlier releases  WhiteFolks  In 2003, Illa would appear under his new moniker ‚ÄúWhiteFolks‚Äù on the Do or Die / Rap-A-Lot Records release ‚ÄúPimpin‚Äô Ain‚Äôt Dead.‚Äù Illa was featured on the album‚Äôs first song, titled ‚ÄúOne More Way.‚Äù ‚ÄúPimpin Ain‚Äôt Dead‚Äù would go on to sell upwards of 200,000 copies. In the same year, World Won Entertainment released ‚ÄúUnderground Classics‚Äù, a collection of Illa's music recorded between 1998-2003 that included the Kanye West produced songs ‚ÄúStrugglin‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúMask & a Pump.‚Äù Illa would further solidify his status as an underground powerhouse in 2004, releasing the cult-classic ‚ÄúTrust None‚Äù DVD movie which was marketed as ‚ÄúChicago‚Äôs First Official Gangsta Film‚Äù alongside his self-tiled ‚ÄúWhiteFolks‚Äù cd, which was produced in its entirety by The Legendary Traxster. The ‚ÄúWhiteFolks‚Äù cd was to be released as a special local-only version, prior to being the national debut release for Traxster's CWAL Mob Recordings record label. The 'WhiteFolks' album garnered serious interest from Steve Rifkind's newly prioritized SRC Records after parting with his previous Loud Records label, as well as Tech N9ne's Strange Music imprint. Illa was featured on the cover of Murder Dog Magazine and other rap publications in preparation for his new national return. The album was met with critical acclaim by both journalists and fans, but after having its release date pushed back several times, the ‚ÄúWhiteFolks‚Äù national release was canceled for unknown reasons. Traxster would ultimately put his CWAL Mob record label on the back burner to concentrate on his production, producing \\"One And Only\\" on Mariah Carey's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" album and Ludacris's hit song \\"My Chick Bad\\" in the years that followed. Illa sold his retail store The Tip shortly after in November 2004 and the location was closed by the new owners roughly six months later.  Final interview  Illa remained scarce for several years after, releasing only 2 underground mixtape CDs titled ‚ÄúCodes & Creeds‚Äù and ‚ÄúScum of The Earth‚Äù between the years 2005-2007. There was an article with featured quotes in a 2008 issue of The Source Magazine regarding Jay-Z stealing the concept for Illa's song ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù and using it on his platinum hit ‚ÄúRoc Boys‚Äù, implying possible legal turbulence. Also in 2008, an impromptu ‚ÄúFinal Interview‚Äù was aired on a local Chicago radio show (https://web.archive.org/web/20081012065912/http://www.djdeluge.net/music.html ). The interview was an in-depth 3 hour feature where Illa candidly answered questions from fans regarding his absence and detailed his more than 15 year rap career. E.C. Illa is no longer known to be recording music and his professional whereabouts are unknown.

He was one of the wealthiest magnates of his era, and a mentor and adviser to Queen Jadwiga of Poland.

In 1377, Dymitr and his brother Iwan received lands (including Goraj) from Louis I of Hungary (Louis was for a period a king of Poland). Dymitr would be one of the most notable supporters of Louis in Poland, possibly even his friend, and took part in important diplomatic missions on behalf of Louis. Dymitr became a mentor and adviser of the Louis daughter and Polish queen Jadwiga of Poland. He (successfully) opposed her marriage to William, Duke of Austria, an event which Jan D≈Çugosz described in his chronicles, and Jan Matejko and Wojciech Gerson reflected in their paintings.

That year he also became the Grand Crown Marshal. Having received significant lands due to his marriage, as well as from the three kings of Poland he had served, Dymitr became one of the wealthiest magnates of his era.

The purpose of the treaty was to agree on a course of action towards obtaining loan repayments from Mexico. Though this went against the main tenet of the Monroe Doctrine (European non-intervention in the Americas), the United States did not offer much opposition as it was engulfed in its own civil war. It led the three countries to dispatch an expedition to Mexico to seek a complete repayment of their debt. After the French made aggressive and unreasonable demands towards the Mexican government, Spain and Britain, realising France's intention to turn Mexico into a puppet state, pulled their troops from Mexico and quickly signed treaties with Mexico allowing them an indefinite hold on the repayment of debt. The resulting struggle is known as the French intervention in Mexico by the army of the Second French Empire, also known as the Maximilian Affair and The Franco-Mexican War. Premise The Convention of London was preceded by a quadrilateral convention in 1860, by which France, Spain, Great Britain and Prussia threatened intervention in Mexico unless the incapacity of its government was changed. The parties to the convention also invited the United States to seek a solution to the financial and social chaos in Mexico. The stalemate between the Mexican political parties, both of whose actions depended on the support of the said European nations and the United States, resulted in a six-year civil war and rendered the country bankrupt. Earlier in May the English navy had disembarked a 400-men strong contingent at San Blas to secure the Mexican Pacific coast custom houses. The ongoing civil war from 1858 resulted in both Mexican political parties becoming indebted. Aside from the country's previous loan contracts the opposing sides ran out of funds and tried to cover their expenses in any way possible. Miguel Miram√≥n of the conservatives chose to apply for a disadvantageous loan lent by creditor firm Jecker and Company. It was composed of 15,000,000 pesos in internal bonds, 619,000 pesos in cash and 368,000 in military clothing. These loans formed the basis of the long-term French claims, which led to the French Intervention in Mexico. In 1860 Miram√≥n took a step further and seized a British deposit of 660,000 pesos reserved for the British bondholders by the Liberal cabinet of Benito Ju√°rez. The same year Ju√°rez also crossed the line by illegally seizing 1,100,000 pesos at Laguna Seca that constituted the property of mainly western European merchants. He immediately returned one third of the plunder and promised to pay 12% interest on the rest after the liberals' victory in the civil war. After their victory Ju√°rez expelled the Spanish minister for allegedly supporting the Miram√≥n faction and his navy seized the Spanish steam frigate La Concepci√≥n. On 11 June 1861 Mexico passed the recompensation deadline of the Lacuna Seca incident and was still not ready to repay the withheld money. Next month the Mexican Government suspended to transfer payments for two years. European claims Don Pacheco Expelled Spanish Minister to Mexico, one of the provisos of the Spanish claims British financial claims dated back to the end of 1851 when, at the Doyle Convention, Mexico agreed to pay 5,000,000 pesos on a 3% yearly interest rate and a 5% redeem rate. At the time of the London Convention, these rates rose to 4 and 6 percent respectively, and the amount of debt had been reduced to 1,800,000 pesos. That same year, the Spanish and Mexican Government settled an old claim of 983,000 pesos (the Juarez party still hadn't recognized the 2 million dollars owed by the Santa Anna government) and additionally provided a new fund of 6,600,000 pesos, which was ratified two years later. The interest rate of the first bonds was set at 3% while the latter was issued at 5%. Mexico also had similar negotiations with France in 1851 and 1853. Those claims totaled 1,759,000 pesos. The French also addressed unfulfillable individual claims on the behalf of French nationals living in Mexico. Such French nationals included a tailor in Mexico City, who had been stabbed in front of his house; a bootmaker who had been robbed and seriously wounded; the relatives' of a Frenchman who was assassinated at Puebla allegedly by the Mexican police; a hotel-keeper who had been robbed twice at Palmar; a farmer who was killed in Durango; a coach-driver who was kidnapped and held for ransom several times; a colporteur who was murdered at Cuernavaca and numerous other instances of robbery, torture or ill-treatment of French subjects in Mexico. Similar claims were added to the Spanish claims as well, including the killing of five Spanish nationals at Cuernavaca and the reconciliation of the Spanish Minister to Mexico and the recovery of the lost ship Concepci√≥n. Altogether with the Jecker debt, France sought a consolidated 10,000,000 pesos. The justness of the Jecker loan became questionable when United States intelligence intercepted an 1862 letter between the Jecker family and Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny, which clearly revealed the ambiguous motivation of the French financial aid and the personal interests of the duke and emperor Napoleon III behind it. The same concerns were brought up in the case of Mexico where Juan de Borb√≥n seemed to be a possible pretender to the Mexican throne. Stance of the United States The United States regarded the claims as unjustifiable or even outrageous, except for those of the British; however the American government offered to cover the arrearages of the debt. This offer was rejected by the allied powers. The U.S. remained neutral, but reserved its right to mobilize and intrude upon Mexican soil on behalf of the safety of its citizens and commercial sphere of interest, if necessary. An American naval blockade was set up in the Gulf of Mexico to secure the trade routes and key ports. This led to an accidental near-collision between an American merchant vessel and the British steamboat Valorous. On another occasion, a near-collision between steamers San Jacinto of the United States and Trent of Britain caused confusion. These incidents had the potential to escalate into a full-on military conflict between the two nations and thus Britain, not wishing to engage in with war with the United States or causing her offence, decided to reduce its naval presence in the expedition. The treaty The treaty consisted of a preamble and five articles and had the following key points: *The assembling of expedition and the launch of a joint expedition to take over the important ports of Mexico. The ports were the main target of the intervention as 100% of the customs income on the Pacific coast and 85% of the Gulf of Mexico were spent redeeming international conventions. Permission to act freely to achieve the common goal and to protect European nationals was granted to the commanders of the operation *None of the participating nations could gain territorial, political or financial advantage nor could attempt to get involved in internal affairs, coup d'√©tat or violation of the rights of Mexican people during the course of the intervention *A Commission of three was empowered to enforce the claims and oversee the distribution of reparations *A formal invitation was forwarded to the United States to join the cause, provided that not in any case would it mean the delay of operations Allied arrangements before taking Veracruz Contemporary view of Veracruz, the meeting point of the Allied forces The following arrangements were agreed upon before the Allied landing to Mexico. (Note that these terms were not part of the treaty.) *As a preliminary precaution for defending the French in the city, the consul of France and the senior French commander should be informed in advance of any assault, so precautionary steps could be taken. *The occupying forces should be half Spanish and half French. *As a main objective of the intervention, the Mexican public treasuries, the custom houses, and administrative revenues should be overseen by an allied tripartite commission, and be sealed and reserved until the arrival of the Commanders-in-Chief. *All forts, fortification or public buildings should be left untouched, their destruction should be only in last resort, to serve the purpose of self-defense *The Spanish naval blockade of Veracruz should not in any case affect the French maritime commerce *After taking the city, the Spanish high command should consult Napoleon III before advancing into inner Mexico or engaging in peace talks. *All French possessions in Mexico must remain intact. *Commodore Dunlop, commander of the British navy, was given equal rights with his French counterpart, but could refrain from the battle in the event of lack of approval of his government.

The firm engaged primarily in the merchant-banking business; it invested (in companies and real estate primarily for the benefit of its own partners and a small number of investment-advisory clients) from its formation until the deaths of Wertheim and one of his senior partners (Edwin Hilson) in 1950 and 1952 respectively. After 1950, control of the firm passed to co- founder Joseph Klingenstein. He was a brilliant investor in stocks, and under his leadership the firm created one of the first professional research departments on Wall Street. In the mid-1950s the firm became more active in underwriting, and subsequently attained major-bracket status in both equity and debt securities. Although its size and visibility did not keep pace with those of fellow major-bracket firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers, the firm expanded significantly in the early 1970s. Under the leadership of Klingenstein's son Fred, Wertheim & Co. expanded its services (research, sales, and trading) to institutional investors and increased its asset management business. As of 1970, the 20 partners and approximately 200 employees generated annual revenues of around $40 million (not including gains recorded in the personal accounts of partners and clients). By 1986, when the Klingenstein family sold its 50% interest in the firm to Schroders, a British merchant bank, Wertheim had 38 managing directors, 51 associate managing directors, a total staff of almost 1,000, annual revenues over $200 million, five offices in the U.S. and three in Europe. The name of the firm was changed to Wertheim Schroder in 1986 after Schroder's initial investment, and to Schroder Wertheim in 1994 after Schroder acquired the remaining 50% interest in the firm. In 2000 Schroders sold its global investment-banking operations (including Schroder Wertheim) to Salomon Smith Barney, a subsidiary of Citigroup. History=1886‚Äì1929 alt=Photo of Maurice Wertheim, about 1922 Maurice Wertheim was born on February 16, 1886 to Jacob Wertheim and his wife, Hannah A. Morgenthau Wertheim. Jacob Wertheim was a founder of Wertheim & Schiffer (later Kerbs, Wertheim & Schiffer), one of several domestic cigar- manufacturing companies which were combined in 1902 to form the United Cigar Manufacturers Company, of which he became president. Jacob was also at one time director of the General Motors Corporation, a director of the Underwood Typewriter Company, and a director of several large real-estate concerns. He was also a founder of the Federation for the Support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies. In 1891, Joseph Klingenstein was born into an immigrant family who operated a dry-goods store on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In 1908, Maurice went to work for his father's company (United Cigar Manufacturers Company) after graduating from Harvard with a B.A. degree in 1906 and an M.A. degree in 1907. In 1909, he married Alma Morgenthau‚Äîdaughter of Henry Morgenthau Sr., a prominent banker, diplomat (Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs Ambassador to Turkey) and philanthropist. Alma's brother, Henry Morgenthau Jr., would become Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934. Three daughters were born from this marriage, one of whom, Barbara W. Tuchman, became a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian (Tuchman authored The Guns of August and A Distant Mirror). The Wertheims lived at 176 East 75th Street and in Cos Cob, Connecticut, at an estate known as Wyndygoul. In 1911, Klingenstein joined Hallgarten & Co. after receiving a B.A. degree from Columbia University and completing one year of Columbia Law School. Neil Finch graduated from West Point, and became a colonel during World War I. Four years later, Maurice joined Hallgarten & Co., becoming a partner in 1919. The following year, Klingenstein left Hallgarten to join Arthur E. Frank. Jacob Wertheim died on November 21, 1920, leaving an estate appraised in December 1921 at $7.3 million gross and $6.0 million net (including $2.1 million in Liberty bonds, $860,377 in Underwood Typewriter common stock, $738,675 in Sears Roebuck common stock, and $560,000 in real estate). The following year, Neil Finch joined Bankers Trust. In 1924, Klingenstein purchased a membership on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and became a floor broker. In 1927 Maurice formed Wertheim & Co. (W&Co.;) with Klingenstein, Finch and Henry Hottinger with offices at 57 William Street. Hottinger had been Jacob Wertheim's secretary; in 1935, he began what would become the Henry Hottinger Collection of rare violins. In its first deal (announced the week it opened), W&Co.; acquired a controlling interest in the Underwood Typewriter Company, merging it with the Elliot-Fisher Company to form one of the largest office-equipment companies of its day. In its early days W&Co.; established one of the first investment- research departments on Wall Street, originally to help the firm's partners invest their own capital. As late as 1971, its well-known reports were produced on onion-skin paper with a gold staple in the corner. In 1928, Herb Goldstone joined the company. The following October, the stock market crashed after a period of rampant speculation; W&Co.;, out of the market before the crash, was not hurt. 1929‚Äì1945 During the Depression, W&Co.; bought Nedicks (a New York restaurant chain famous for its hot dogs) for $46,000; after paying $3 million in dividends over the years, it sold Nedicks for $4.5 million in 1951. Its investment-banking clients included Continental Baking, Bristol Myers, Spiegel and Underwood Typewriter. W&Co.; partners liked to take long winter vacations in Cuba, which was then a playground for Americans seeking a break from the constraints of the later Prohibition era. Cuba was also the headquarters of some of the biggest sugar companies in the world. Before long, W&Co.; had an interest in a number of sugar growers and refiners; Maurice bought a home in Cuba, and visited there regularly. Through partnerships (first with Arnold Kirkeby, and later with Jesse Sharp and Spencer-Taylor), W&Co.; made many investments in real estate - particularly hotels and office buildings, the market for which was severely depressed because of the Depression. Control of these properties was obtained by buying defaulted mortgage bonds selling for a fraction of their face value. Among the firm's many investments were: 120 Broadway (Equitable Building); One Fifth Avenue; the Madison Hotel; Hampshire House; Brooklyn Towers; The Warwick; Saranac Inn; Hotel Nacional de Cuba; Blackstone Hotel in Chicago; Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles; the Ritz Towers and Delmonico's. At this time Finch left the company, to be replaced by Richard Bernhard. Bernhard, married to Dorothy Lehman, provided close contact with other major investment-banking firms in New York. Maurice divorced his first wife in 1929; he married Ruth White Warfield, whom he divorced in 1935, marrying Cecile Berlage. The couple moved to a penthouse at 33 East 70th Street. In 1930 Walter Laband, a German- educated banker, joined W&Co.; with responsibility for foreign offices acquired from Colbin & Co. in London and Amsterdam. The company's primary activity is arbitrage in foreign securities. Two years later, the failure of Hilson & Neuberger brought Edwin Hilson, Milton Steinbach (Klingenstein's brother-in-law) and George Jones to W&Co.; Hilson was a self-made man, whose formal education reportedly ended when he was expelled from Exeter at age 16 for adolescent high jinks. He sold cigars to western Pennsylvania coal miners (like Maurice, Hilson's father was in the cigar-manufacturing business), was drafted into the army during World War I, and returned to Wall Street. A friend from Exeter introduced him to Harry Neuberger, who put up the money to start Hilson & Neuberger. Another friend of Hilson from P.S. 6 in New York was Sidney Weinberg, who became head of Goldman Sachs. Steinbach was a product of Andover and Yale; Jones was Hilson's assistant. During that year the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) bottomed at 41, down 89% from the 1929 high of 381. NYSE volume declined to 425 million shares, from 1.1 billion in 1929 and 810 million in 1930. The value of a seat on the NYSE fell to $68,000, from $550,000 in 1929. The U.S. unemployment rate in 1933 reached 25%. In 1933, Roosevelt proclaimed a bank holiday and embargoed gold; Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 (the \\"truth in securities law\\"). W&Co.; moved its funds into Treasury bills before the bank holiday. The following year, Alfred Kleinbaum joined W&Co.; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was established by Congress under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In 1935 Maurice purchased The Nation (the oldest liberal weekly magazine in the U.S.) when it was on the brink of bankruptcy; his daughter Barbara began to write for the magazine. Two years later, he sold the magazine to its editor. The same year, Maurice purchased from the Chubb family (of Chubb Insurance) the lease for private fishing on the entire Saint Anne River on the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec. On the river, he built a lodge at the Serenity Pool. In 1969, all leases for private fishing on the Saint Anne River were ceded by Cecile Wertheim to the Government of Quebec. In 1936, Maurice began his collection of late 19th- and early 20th-century Impressionist paintings and sculpture (after his death, the collection was given to Harvard University and is housed at Harvard's Fogg Museum in Cambridge). Most of his acquisitions were made during World War II. As the 1940s began Steinbach was the firm's investment banker, Klingenstein the stock picker and trader, Hottinger the administrator, Hilson the deal man, Bernhard the contact with other Wall Street firms, and Maurice was increasingly involved in public affairs and personal interests. Banking clients included Continental Baking and Helena Rubenstein; the firm's foreign offices were closed because of World War II. Cuban operations provided shelter from the excess-profits tax during the war years. In 1941, Maurice was named president of the American Jewish Committee; the following year, he moved to Washington DC as a member of the War Production Board. 1945‚Äì2000 In 1946, Maurice led the American chess team as its non-playing captain against the Soviet team in Moscow, in a match played over the radio. Laband retired, making a personal gift of one week's salary to every employee of the firm. Bob Bach joined the firm, after graduating from Princeton and serving in the U.S. Navy. The following year, Maurice donated in Suffolk County to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a wildlife refuge (the Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge). He and his wife Cecile had previously managed the area as a private waterfowl conservation and hunting reserve. In 1948, Maurice published a book entitled Salmon on the Dry Fly. In 1949, W&Co.; had nine partners: Maurice, Klingenstein, Hilson, Steinbach, Jones, Goldstone, Bach, Hottinger and Allen DuBois (who headed the underwriting department). Wilbur Cowett joined the company, working closely with Hilson. Maurice died in 1950, at age 64. His obituary noted that he was a trustee of the American Wildlife Foundation, a noted fisherman, a tournament chess player, founder and director of the New York Theatre Guild, an equestrian, and director of the Underwood Corporation, the Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company, the Hat Corporation of America, and the Bond Stores Company. He was also a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. Entering the 1950s, W&Co.; was one of the leading U.S. firms in trading foreign securities. Investment-banking clients included Armour and Company, Food Fair, Spiegel, Shoe Corporation and Miles Shoe. Bill Kerr joined the company from Bacon Whipple; he had excellent contacts in the industry as president of the Investment Bankers Association of America (forerunner of the Securities Industry Association) in 1958‚Äì1959. The company was active in trading telephone bonds in joint accounts with Goldman Sachs and others; most of the real-estate holdings were liquidated. John Hilson (son of Eddie) joined the company. In 1952, Eddie Hilson died at the age of 57. He had become involved in politics through his wife, Mildred, who remained active after his death and became a close friend of the Eisenhowers. President Eisenhower painted a portrait of her, and her 90th birthday party in 1988 was attended by Richard Nixon (who played \\"Happy Birthday\\" on the piano for her) and Henry Kissinger. In 1953, Alan Cohn joined the company. The following year, 120 Broadway was sold to William Zeckendorf. Also in 1954 Fred Klingenstein (Joseph's son) joined the company; he eventually led a shift in the firm's emphasis from merchant banking to investment banking, asset management and institutional brokerage. John Klingenstein (Fred's brother) joined W&Co.; in 1959, the year Fidel Castro took power in Cuba and confiscated U.S. investments (W&Co.;‚Äôs investments in Cuba were liquidated long before). During the 1960s, W&Co.; (assisted by Kerr) became one of about 20 major-bracket underwriters; this was also due to close relationships between Steinbach and Gus Levy at Goldman Sachs, and Cowett and Ralph DeNunzio at Kidder Peabody. Investment- banking clients included Dreyfus, Armour and Ward Drug. Bob Bach spearheaded efforts to expand institutional brokerage operations. In 1962, the company moved its offices from 120 Broadway to the recently constructed 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza and opened a Paris office in 1964. As an historical footnote, in 1965 the DJIA approached 1000 with a high for the year of 969; it would not cross that threshold until 1972, and would remain around that level until 1983. The 1967 acquisition of Martin E. Segal Co. added to growth in investment-management operations, and in 1969 W&Co.; successfully defended its client, Armour, from a hostile-takeover bid by Greyhound. Steinbach died in 1970, age 67. His obituary noted that he was a trustee of Mt.

The following year, LEWCO Securities Corp. formed as a partnership between Lehman Bros. and Wertheim & Co. to consolidate back-office operations. Also in 1974, Robert Shapiro joined W&Co.; from Lehman Brothers; he led a buildup in the corporate- bond department and initiated the firm's entry into risk arbitrage, U.S. government securities, and OTC trading.

The company acquired a Geneva office from A.G. Becker in 1984. That same year, Lehman Bros. was acquired by Shearson and withdrew from LEWCO; Moseley and Hambrecht & Quist (H&Q;) joined LEWCO. Managed by Frederick Klingenstein and Pierre Philippe, (head of the famed asset management firm Pan Holding), Wertheim also formed a strategic joint-venture called \\"Wertheim Philippe International\\". A September 1985 article by Dan Rottenberg in Town & Country magazine, entitled \\"The Explosive New World of Wall Street\\" (in a section sub- headed \\"Merchant Bankers\\" that also provides profiles of Allen & Company, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., Dillon, Read & Co. and Lazard Freres & Co.), describes Wertheim & Co. as follows: In 1986 Schroders, plc (a British merchant bank) purchased a 50% interest in W&Co.; the firm's name changed to Wertheim Schroder & Co. (WS&Co.;). http://klingenstein.com/pdf/KF_ADV_Part2A-2B.pdf Two years later, WS&Co.; moved its offices from the Pan Am Building to the Equitable Tower and the firm became a primary dealer in U.S. government securities. Moseley went out of business, leaving WS&Co.; and H&Q; as co-owners of LEWCO. Fred Klingenstein left WS&Co.; to form Klingenstein Fields & Co., an investment management firm. In 1989, WS&Co.; sold minority interests to three institutions: Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., Bank of Boston, and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company; a Los Angeles office opened under the leadership of Robert Fisher. The following year, the company acquired Amsterdam and Houston offices from Drexel Burnham.

It was originally built by the House of Savoy in the 17th century. History The original structure was designed in early 1615 by the Italian soldier, architect and military engineer, Ascanio Vitozzi. When he died in 1615, the project passed to his collaborators, father and son Carlo and Amedeo di Castellamonte. The original building was built for the Prince-Cardinal Maurice of Savoy during the reign of his brother Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy. The property was built as a private villa with its own vineyard, hence its alternative name of Vigna di Madama. In 1637 Cardinal Maurice lost his brother and his sister in law Christine Marie of France became Regent of Savoy for her young son, Carlo Emanuele II of Savoye. Prince Maurice of Savoy and his brother Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano opposed the Regency and fled to Spain. Following his return to Turin, Maurice died at the Villa in 1657 and willed it to his wife Louise Christine of Savoy who also died there in 1692. At the death of Louise Christine, it passed to Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans, niece of Louis XIV of Franceand great niece of Christine Marie wife Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy in 1684. She used the Vigna when she could. Most of the present d√©cor of the Vigna is from her lifetime. Her husband was the King of Sicily from 1713 till 1720, when he exchanged Sicily with Sardinia. From then on, the building was known as Villa della Regina (\\"Villa of the Queen\\"). It was here Anne Marie died in 1728. Anne Marie's eldest daughter Maria Adelaidemother of Louis XV of France came here and tried to recreate it at Versailles at the M√©nagerie. Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg, daughter in law of Anne Marie, did some work in the main saloon of the building when she became the owner of the villa in 1728 at the death of Anne Marie. Inside there are frescoes and paintings by Giovanni Battista Crosato, Daniel Seyter and Corrado Giaquinto in the main room, grotesques of Filippo Minei and paintings by the brothers Domenico and Giuseppe Valeriani in the near rooms; there are also precious Chinese Cabinets in lacquer and golden wood. In the park there is the Pavilion of the Solinghi, pagoda building in which the Academy of the Solinghi used to meet; it was a group of intellectuals founded by the Cardinal Maurice. The Villa was later used by the Spanish Queen of Sardinia Maria Antonietta Ferdinanda.youngest daughter of Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese It remained the property of the House of Savoy till 1868 when it was donated by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy to the Institute of the Army's Daughters and in 1994 it was given to the State domain. Damaged in the Second World War, it is today open to the public in order to fund its maintenance.

Gilbertfield In March 2017, an application by Persimmon Homes to build almost 400 houses in land immediately to the north of Gilbertfield Castle was approved by South Lanarkshire Council's planning committee; this was somewhat controversial as the land had previously been designated Green belt.

Revisions had already been made to the plans after the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency objected to the builder's initial submission in 2016.

During 47 years, he never missed one day of work. In 2004, the middle school was named \\"Lawton C. Johnson Summit Middle School\\" in his honor. Career Johnson was born in Summit, New Jersey and studied piano under instructor Capitola Dickerson. Right after graduation from Summit High School, he began working at what was then called Summit Junior high school, rising to office manager, and continued working until retiring in August 2007. While a student, he was part- time office assistant from 1954 through 1956; after graduation, he became school secretary in 1956. In 1962 he became Office Manager. During his 52+ year career he worked for six school superintendents: Roberts Reed, Roland Wolcott (interim), William Purcell, Robert Salisbury, Richard Fiander, and Michael Knowlton, and six Summit Middle School principals: Robert Woodward, Charles Kemper, Donald DeBanico, Joseph Czarnecki, Gerard Murphy, and Theodore Stanik. He did extensive volunteer work for numerous school-related committees, events planning groups, YMCA boards, communications groups, civic groups, newspaper editing, and other charitable activities. He was elected Young Man of the Year in 1961 by Summit Area Junior Chamber of Commerce and he was named in the 1965 edition of Outstanding Young Men in America. Johnson was known for his \\"positive attitude\\" and \\"friendly demeanor\\" and \\"willingness to go the extra mile to help someone in need of assistance\\" according to Summit Middle School principal Matt Block in 2009. \\"No favor was too great, and no task was too small ... He embodied dedication and hard work by being the first one to arrive to school each morning and the last one to go home each evening, sometimes working through the weekend, if necessary, in order to get the job done. Amazingly, for 47 of his 52 years, Mr. Johnson did not miss one day of work.\\" Johnson received the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service Keeper of the Dream Award and the Tri-City Branch NAACP Community Service Award. In October 2007, Summit Mayor Jordan Glatt proclaimed Oct. 2, 2007, as Lawton C. Johnson Appreciation Day in recognition of his years of outstanding service to the city, the middle school and to the church. In 2004, the Summit Board of Education decided to rename the middle school in Johnson's honor. Former Summit middle school principal Ted Stanik said one of Johnson's great joys after the school's renaming was answering the phone, \\"Lawton C. Johnson Summit Middle School. This is Lawton C. Johnson,\\" Stanik said, \\"It brought a smile to his face every time he did it.\\" Most of Summit's schools are named after founding fathers. The middle school's renaming was a first for the city‚Äîan honor never before given an employee. Johnson was described as a \\"gifted, remarkable, compassionate and uniquely talented person,\\" according to Reverend Denison D. Harrield, Jr., who first approached the Summit Board of Education with the idea of renaming the middle school after Johnson. \\"He touched the lives of so many people.\\" He died on September 14, 2009, after a long struggle with cancer.

History The school was founded by Elizabeth Joan Goldthorpe in 1993 out of the closure of Upper Chine School with 14 primary aged pupils based in Shanklin. During her ownership, the position of headteacher was taken over by her daughter, Katherine, and the school expanded up to GCSE level. In 2009, the school was sold to parent Edmund Matyjaszek, who introduced improvements as noted by Ofsted in 2010 and expanded the school to A Levels in 2010. The school received a Good Schools Guide Award for boys at an English Independent School taking Biology GCSE in 2010. In 2015 it received a further Good Schools Guide Award for teaching Additional Science at GCSE to boys. In April 2012, a teacher was suspended and investigated in reference to alterations to exam scripts without pupil knowledge. Further to a ban on dealing with exams and invigilating, the teacher returned in a teaching position in September. It achieved 100% pass rates at GCSE & A Level in 2016 & 2017\\\\. In the Department of Education League Tables, published in February 2018, Priory School was ranked best on the Isle of Wight for A Levels, best on the Isle of Wight for GCSE English & Maths, and ranked 21st out of 4417 Secondary Schools in England for A Levels. The 2012 pass rates for the school were 100% 5+ A*-C for Year 11 with 81% A*-B and 100% A*-C for 11 subjects, Maths, Further Maths, Statistics, Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, History, Religious Studies, ICT and Art. For A Level, the school had 94% pass rate with 69% A* to C and 50% A* to A. The school was rated as good with outstanding features in its latest Ofsted inspection in May 2018. The Principal praised the positive report from Ofsted and commented he believed that Queen Victoria would be pleased with the school being at Whippingham, where she herself had founded a school in 1864. HRH Princess Beatrice of York visited the school on 16 June 2014 to unveil a plaque to commemorate 150 years of continuous education on the Whippingham site. In September 2017, to reflect the Christian ethos, the school name was extended to Priory School of Our Lady of Walsingham with approval of the Bishop of Portsmouth, Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham and Custodian of the Basilica at Walsingham. Location Originally located in the Broadway, Sandown, the school moved to temporary accommodation at Landguard Manor, Shanklin before relocating to Alverstone Manor, also in Shanklin, in 2005. After an initial rejection to this new location, temporary planning permission for 2 years was given to the school in 2005, with the time limit subsequently removed in 2007. Having sought a new building since coming under new ownership, the school purchased and moved into the former Whippingham Primary School, built by Queen Victoria in 1864 to the design of Prince Albert, in February 2012.

The genus, widespread in tropical areas, contains about 70 species. Amauroderma fungi are wood-decay fungi that feed and fruit on decayed branches and trunks. The fruit bodies of Amauroderma fungi comprise a cap and a stipe, and are typically woody, leathery, or corky in texture. The spores produced are usually spherical or nearly so, with a characteristic double wall structure that features U-shaped thickenings. Taxonomy Amauroderma was circumscribed by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1905. He set Amauroderma regulicolor (previously known as Fomes regulicolor Berk. ex Cooke), collected from Cuba, as the type species. The name Amauroderma had been used previously by Narcisse Patouillard, when he proposed that Ganoderma be divided into the sections Ganoderma and Amauroderma. Patouillard described the characteristics of section Amauroderma as follows: \\"Spores globose or subglobose, devoid of truncated base, warty, woodruff or smooth; crust hat or dull stipe pruinose, rarely shining.\\" In 1920, Torrend promoted Ganoderma sect. Amauroderma to generic status, with Amauroderma auriscalpium as the type. This resulted in an illegitimate homonym, as Murrill's earlier usage of the name has priority. The generic name means \\"dark/dusky-skinned\\" (from , meaning \\"dark or dusky\\", and , meaning \\"skin\\"). Several studies using molecular phylogenetics have shown that Amauroderma, as currently circumscribed, is not a monophyletic taxon and will need to be revised. Description The fruit bodies of Amauroderma species are stipitate except in A. andina and may attain various shapes although centrally stipitate basidiocarps are most common. Several stipes may arise from the same base, frequently resulting in fused caps and compound fruit bodies. In section some fruit bodies are distinct with one or two distinct inner black bands or zones. The stipe is often duplex with an outer dense layer surrounding an inner softer or hollow core sometimes separated by a black band. In species with a distinct tomentum on the stipe, there is often a dark zone just below the tomentum of the cap. These zones are absent from some species with a pale stipe without a tomentum. However, when present they continue into the context and frequently there is also another zone stretching more or less horizontally across the context. Most basidiospores of Amauroderma mushrooms have an inner ornamented wall on which there is a hyaline (translucent) epicutis, which is very thin and difficult to see in ordinary microscopic preparations. Mature basidiospores are pale-yellowish. An apiculus (a depressed area where the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma) is often difficult to observe. Chemistry Amauroderma camerarium produces the anti-Trichomonas vaginalis protein that has been named amaurocine. Habitat and distribution Amauroderma is widespread in tropical areas. Twenty species have been recorded from Brazil; six have been confirmed in China. A collection of Amauroderma sprucei made in Florida in 2016 was the first recorded time that the genus has been collected in the United States. Amauroderma schomburgkii, A. coltricioides, and A. calcigenum are examples of the genus that have been found fruiting on soil. Amauroderma schomburgkii is the most common neotropical species. Species Unidentified Amauroderma found in Colombia The tenth edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi (2008) indicated that were about 30 species in the genus. , Index Fungorum accepts 68 species of Amauroderma. *Amauroderma africana Ryvarden (2004) *Amauroderma albostipitatum A.C.Gomes-Silva, Ryvarden & T.B.Gibertoni (2015) ‚Äì Brazil *Amauroderma amoiense J.D.Zhao & L.W.Hsu (1983) *Amauroderma andina Ryvarden (2004) *Amauroderma argenteofulvum (Van der Byl) Doidge (1950) ‚Äì Africa *Amauroderma auriscalpium (Berk.)

Personal history Morrison was born in Brotton, North Yorkshire in 1868 to Robert Morrison, a mine owner from Newcastle upon Tyne. He was educated at St. George's School in Harrogate and Loretto School before matriculating to Caius College, Cambridge in 1887. Rugby career Morrison came to note as a rugby player when he played for Cambridge University. He won four sporting 'Blues', his first was in 1887, when he played at three-quarter along with Macbeth Duncan and Frederic Alderson.Marshall (1951), pg 68. Cambridge won the 1887 Varsity Match, and repeated the feat the next season, this time Morrison was joined by Thomas Todd and Alderson. In the 1889 Varsity Match, Morrison was given the captaincy of the Cambridge team,Marshall (1951), pg 73. but Cambridge lost by two tries to nil in a hard fought match. Morrsion played one more season with Cambridge, including the 1890 Varsity game, which ended in a no-score draw. While still representing Cambridge, Morrison was first selected to represent the English national team. He was brought in at wing to face Wales in the opening match of the 1890 Home Nations Championship. Despite losing the Welsh encounter, the English selectors kept faith with Morrison and he experienced his first international victory in a 6-0 win. The final game of the tournament was against Ireland, and Morrison completed the season by scoring his first and only international try. The English scored two tries in the first half of the game, and Morrison managed to score a try of his own when a passage of good English passing and some poor Irish tackling allowed him to touchdown between the posts. In 1890, Morrison was approached by William Percy Carpmael to join his newly formed invitational touring team, the Barbarians. Morrison accepted and became one of the original members of the team. Morrison's final international was in the match against Ireland in the 1891 Championship. Joined at three-quarters with old Cambridge teammate Alderson, Morrison finished his international career with a 9-0 win.

Both Ryves's Christian name and surname were variously spelled by his contemporaries: Brune, Bruen, Brian, Bruno; and Reeves, Rives, Ryve, Reeve, and Ryves. Life He was son of Thomas, and grandson of John Ryves of Damory Court, Dorset. Sir Thomas Ryves and Sir William Ryves were his first cousins. He was educated at Oxford, subscribing as a clerk of New College in 1610. He graduated B.A. in 1616, and in the following year became a clerk of Magdalen College, proceeding M.A. 9 June 1619, B.D. 20 June 1632, and D.D. 25 June 1639. He was admitted of Gray's Inn in 1634. In the meantime he was instituted to the vicarage of Stanwell in Middlesex, where he made a name by his preaching; he obtained in September 1628 the additional benefice of St. Martin-le-Vintry. About 1640 he became chaplain to Charles I. The inhabitants of Stanwell petitioned against him in July 1642: he was deprived of his benefices, and a parliamentary preacher appointed. He was expelled with his family, but sheltered by Lord Arundell at Wardour Castle. A patent of June 1646 created him dean of Chichester, but he remained dependent on charity at Shafton in Dorset until after 1649, when he made at least one journey abroad, bearing to Charles II some money which had been collected among his adherents. At the Restoration he was in July 1660 installed dean of Chichester and master of the hospital there; he was also sworn chaplain-in-ordinary to the king, and appointed dean of Windsor (and Wolverhampton), being installed on 3 September 1660. He became scribe of the order of the Garter the following January. As administrator of the charity of the poor knights of Windsor, he had to deal with the appeals of decayed royalists. He was presented to the rectories of Haseley, Oxfordshire, and Acton, in Middlesex. In January 1662, when there was unseasonable hot weather, he preached to the House of Commons at St. Margaret's, on Joshua vii. 12, showing how the neglect of exacting justice on offenders was a cause of God's punishing a land. Practising what he preached, he had his curate at Acton harass Richard Baxter, who was drawing large audiences in defiance of the conventicle act. Baxter was eventually imprisoned for six months, causing Ryves damage with a reputation as embittered. Ryves died at Windsor on 13 July 1677, and was buried in the south aisle of St. George's Chapel. By his wife, Kate, daughter of Sir Richard Waldram, knt., of Charley, Leicestershire, he had several children. Works Besides sermons, Ryves was the author of Mercurius Rusticus; or the Countries Complaint of the Barbarous Outrages committed by the Sectaries of this late flourishing Kingdom. Nineteen numbers appeared from June to December 1643, and were republished together, in 1646, 1647, and 1685. George Wither started a parliamentary Mercurius Rusticus as a counter. The assaults on Sir John Lucas's house, Wardour Castle, and other mansions are narrated, while a second part starts on damage done to the cathedrals. The intention was to scare the reader with the brutality of parliamentary troopers.Nigel Smith, Literature and Revolution in England, 1640‚Äì1660 (1994), p. 198. It was frequently bound up, under the common title of Angliae Ruina, with the Querela Cantabrigiensis of John Barwick. Ryves assisted Brian Walton in his work on the London tithes, and contributed to his polyglot bible.

After working in various positions around the country, he became Principal Staff Officer to former Inspector- General of Police, Muhammadu Gambo, then Deputy Commissioner of Police in Edo State, and then Commissioner of Police first in Delta State and then in Rivers State and Abia State. He was appointed Assistant Inspector General of Police in A.I.G Zone One Kano, the position he held when promoted to Inspector General of Police on 6 March 2002. In November 2001, as A.I.G., Tafa Balogun reassured reporters that there were provisions to ensure the safety of businessmen in Nigeria through the called Diplomatic Corp and Foreign National Protection Unit. Inspector General of Police Mustafa Adebayo Balogun became IGP in March 2002, replacing Musiliu Smith. He was responsible for overall police security during the April 2003 national elections, which were marred by reports of police abuses. In August 2003, Tafa Balogun presented a paper on \\"Nigeria: Electoral Violence and National Security\\" in which he advocated improvements such as use of national identity cards, mass education, electoral law reforms, citizens participation in politics, good governance and establishment of a constitutional court. In December 2003, Tafa Balogun organised extensive security measures across Nigeria to ensure that there were no disturbances during the Commonwealth of Nations summit. Following various incidents in 2004 where reporters were beaten and their equipment damaged by police men, Tafa Balogun made apologies and promised that those responsible would be punished. Towards the end of 2004, newspapers published allegations of corruption on a massive scale, asserting that Tafa Balogun had pocketed public money and taken bribes from politicians and criminals. These led to his forced retirement in January 2005. Later career On 4 April 2005, Tafa Balogun was arraigned at the Federal High Court, Abuja on charges involving about N13 billion obtained through money laundering, theft and other sources. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission under Nuhu Ribadu brought 70 charges against Tafa Balogun covering the period from 2002 to 2004. He made a plea bargain with the court in exchange for returning much of the property and money. He was sentenced to six months in jail. He was released on 9 February 2006 after serving his sentence, part of it in Abuja National Hospital. In November 2008 and again in February 2009, the Chairman of the House Committee on Police Affairs, Abdul Ahmed Ningi, asked the Inspector General of Police Mike Okiro, to provide details of the money recovered from Tafa Balogun, a request that he passed on to the EFCC chairman, Mrs Farida Waziri. However, the EFCC stated that they did not have records of the exact properties recovered from Balogun. It was said that some of the houses had been secretly sold to certain individuals at give-away prices. In April 2009, the House of Representatives Committee on Police Affair invited Tafa Balogun, Mike Okiro and Mrs Farida Waziri to explain how the N16 billion allegedly recovered from Balogun got missing.

Her achievements lay in creating a system which enabled the American Library Association to accredit existing library school programs. She is considered one of the most influential librarians in the field of library science due to her efforts in implementing a universal curriculum in order to teach students the fundamentals of library science.Annual Report of the Board of Education for Librarianship, p.5-22. Carnegie Corporation, 1924 Early life Sarah Bogle was born in 1870, at a time when most women stayed home and attended to domestic affairs. When she was fourteen she began two years of private tutelage at an academy for women. Afterwards she traveled from place to place while attending such colleges as the University of Chicago in Illinois. Her career as a librarian began in 1903 at the age of thirty ‚Äìtwo when she graduated from the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia.Sullivan, P: Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services, p.17. Marcel Dekker, 2003. After graduation she worked in the academic library at a small college before making the transition to a public librarian for the East Liberty Branch of the Pittsburg library system. Owing to a series of unfortunate circumstances that accumulated with the resignation of the Head of the Children's Department; Bogle stepped into the role of overseeing the branch of the children's library as well as the training school associated with the children's department. In 1911 Bogle became principle of the training school for Children's Librarians (which in 1916 became the Carnegie Library School) and established a core curriculum of required subjects and electives for specialized areas.Sullivan, P: Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services, p.17. Marcel Dekker, 2003. Assistant Secretary In 1920 Sarah Bogle accepted a position as Assistant Secretary for the American Library Association. She worked closely with other colleagues to establish a training school in Paris to educate future librarians. Bogle's time as Library School Director at the Carnegie Library School helped her prepare for the international scope of this project. Her colleagues often noted Bogle's skill in dealing with people, and her knack for acquiring money through grants and working closely with foundation directors.Bogle, S: Library Development in France, Library Occurrent, 7: 13 Work Overseas Her ability to acquire money through grants led Bogle to develop and implement a training program in 1923 in France while she was Assistant Secretary to the ALA. She organized the effort to train French students by bringing in American librarians to teach classes in cataloging, references, and administration work. According to Mary Niles Maack, Sarah Bogle was adamant that the French could contribute as much to the new client- centered system of librarianship that was being trained in the schools as American teachers could contribute to the library schools in France.Maalack, M: American Bookwomen in Paris During the 1920s, Library and Culture, 40: 399 As Sarah Bogle stated in an article in the Library Occurrent concerning the set-up of an American trained library school in France; \\"With the richness of her (France) book collections, with the depth of her culture, with the excellence of her bibliographic work she can contribute when proper avenues of interchange are established quite as much to this newer country as the newer country can give to her in the way of library technique, means of accessibility to books and related material, and a progressiveness and outlook which are sadly needed at this time\\" Bogle, S: Trends and Tendencies in Education for Librarianship, The Library Journal, 56:1029 Work in the South Bogle was not only noted for her international efforts in establishing training programs for librarians overseas, but also for the minority groups in the United States. With the help of Tommie Dora Parker, Bogle sought to provide a library training program to blacks in the south. One outcome of her efforts was the funding of the Hampton Institute Library.Sullivan, P: Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services, p.17. Marcel Dekker, 2003. Influencing Library Training As Assistant Secretary of the American Library Association, Bogle saw her role as a means to harness the lackadaisical efforts of training librarians. She understood that the work of the librarian was constantly changing. In her article, \\"Trends and Tendencies in Education for Librarianship\\", she acknowledge that, \\"it is difficult to try to discern or deduce future trends of library training from a knowledge gained through the study of educational progress in vocations long since self-organized and accepted as professions\\" Bogle, S: Trends and Tendencies in Education for Librarianship, The Library Journal, 56:1029 Still, she believed it was necessary to lay down a foundation of core curriculum that would be necessary in the field of librarianship. The establishment of the Board of Education for Librarianship in 1924 was a committee made up of those who wanted to lay down a minimum standard that had to be achieved in order to be fully endorsed by the ALA for library schools. The outlined the organization, administration, instructional staff, financial status, and equipment that each school must possess in order to meet the ALA standard to be considered an accredited library program. Conclusion Sarah Bogle's efforts in establishing a basis in which all library schools must have a certain curriculum in place for the proper teaching of library science was based in part on her thinking that \\"a high professional spirit calls for sound training, clear ethical standards, and sustained enthusiasm for the fellowship of librarians\\" Bogle, S: \\"Library Development in France\\", Library Occurrent, 7: 13 Her ideas in what it means to be a librarian were realized in her efforts in the field of training future librarians for the ever-changing landscape of library science.

The novel is about life in a Karachi slum built after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and about the struggles in the lives of poor people living there. Khuda Ki Basti TV Drama Serials were made in 1969 and 1974 based on the novel.Info on Khuda Ki Basti (novel) on United Nations (UNESCO) website Retrieved 27 July 2018  Description  A modern classic of Urdu literature by Shaukat Siddiqui, Khuda Ki Basti (God's Own Land), takes place during the 1950s in the slums of Karachi and Lahore in a newly independent Pakistan. The story revolves around a poor, respectable family which has fallen on hard times. Corruption and degradation take over their lives. Jobless, and without any real hope of a better life, they find themselves in the clutches of unprincipled evil people who exploit them. It's the story of a young woman, Sultana, and her younger brother Annu. Their widowed mother is first pursued by a conniving man from the neighbourhood who apparently wants to marry her. But whose real intentions are to get access to her pretty young daughter, Sultana, for his sexual pleasure. After this man marries the mother, he arranges a medically facilitated murder of her. Then the vulnerable children are exploited in every way by the neighbourhood shady characters. The tragic, deeply moving finale is inevitable. Adaptations Khuda Ki Basti was adapted as a serial produced by Pakistan Television in 1969 and 1974. In 1974, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto asked for the re-telecast of Khuda Ki Basti as it was Bhutto‚Äôs favorite TV serial for its appealing social message. But Pakistan Television had problems with it as the video tape recordings of Khuda Ki Basti on spool video tape in 1969 had long been erased due to video tape scarcity back then and re-recording of other programs on the same video tape. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto insisted that the serial must be re-telecast even if fresh recording is essential. The 1974 version of re-recorded Khuda Ki Basti was 50-minute episodes which lasted 13 weeks and created the same social impact that the 1969 version did. TV directors Bakhtiyar Ahmed and Qasim Jalali did a fine job. After 1974 version was filmed, the entire TV serial has been well maintained by Pakistan Television with a repeat telecast in 1990.

Bind are under the OBCs category of the central list. The government of India's draft defines them as a nomadic tribe in Tripura. The Assam government and MP government categorise them as a tribe. The nearest name which comes closer for them is Nishad. The Bind are originally from the Vindhya. History and origin The Bind community is originally a tribe which traces its history to the Vindhya range. The very word Bind is derived from \\"Vindhya\\" which literally means hunter in Sanskrit. The Bind were historically engaged in a community around the Vindhyachal region before they spread throughout central and eastern parts of the country. The 1881 Census found out that there were around more 2 lakh Binds India, mainly residing in Bengal, Assam and North-West province. The census also noted that there were toddy drawer and cultivators. The main part of job as toddy drawer was to make palm jaggery. In the Purvanchal region there were traditionally boatmen, cultivators and artisans. They used to craft baskets, bags and mats from arundo, giant reed, plant. The artisanship among Binds is lost as there have been marginalisation of the community which couldn't maintain to revive its artisanship at community level. The crafts made by Binds used to be sold seasonally in fares across the Purvanchal region. A rough estimate is that there are 9.50 lakh Binds in India. It is one the numerically weaker sections of the society. The nearest group which comes closer to the Bind are Nishads. The Bind community has a distinct identity as a group from other groups, which were also engaged in the similar jobs, because it is basically a tribe. And, it is important to maintain its distinct identity. The Bind or Bin are sub- divided into seven occupational groups. These sub-groups are the Suraia, Nisadh, Kulawat, Mallaah, Guria, Kewat and Bind or Bin proper. Each of these sub-groups have specialised occupations. The speciality of the Kewat, Nisadh and Kulawat is to catch fish; the Mallaah and Guria are traditionally boatmen.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das page 331 In Bihar, Assam according to their traditions, the Bind once belonged to the Jaliya caste. The Noniya were forced to become grave-diggers by the early Muslim rulers, while the ancestors of the Bind fled to the forests, and evolved into a community. They have two sub-divisions, the Jethaut and the Kharaut. They are found in the districts of Samastipur, Begusarai, Darbhanga and Saran.

However, this proposal, which relates to votebank politics and has been made in the past, has been stayed by the courts; a prior attempt was also rejected by the Centre. The Bind have a traditional caste council and, like other occupational castes, maintain strict social control over members. They are Hindu, and customs similar to other similar groupings such as the Kewat. They are concentrated in eastern Uttar Pradesh, and speak Bhojpuri.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das page 333 In Bihar, the Jethaut are mainly engaged in fishing, well sinking and basket making, the Noniya are salt manufacturers, while the Kharaut are mainly farmers. They speak the Maithili dialect of Hindi. Religion and Culture The Bind have two important septs, the Narayaniha and Maiwarha. The Narayaniha are worshippers of the orthodox Hindu gods, Mahadev, Parvati, Mahabir or Hanuman, and, in particular, Satya Narayan or Vishnu. The Maiwarha themselves derive their name from the town of Mau in the Azamgarh District. They are chiefly worshippers of the Shakti, goddess Durga or Kali in more localised forms, which is more popular Sept of the Bind. There is controversial part when the community was mistakenly believed to be the Panchopirihas. The Bind have been paganist in the past. The Bind community was significantly Hinduised, as Nath sampraday started making a presence among the folk with the Bhakti movement.

It was built between 1901 and 1903 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. Tudor Mill was next to the Ashton Canal Warehouse at Portland Basin. It ceased spinning cotton in the 1960s and was used as a warehouse until it was destroyed by fire in 1970 Location The remaining chimney marks the position of the adjacent Junction Mill Tudor mill was built on the site of the former Portland House and the Stamford brewery, next to the Portland Basin on the final section of the Ashton Canal, where it joined the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. History The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate. The syndicate went on to build the Rock Mill, Curzon Mill, and then, in 1901, the Tudor Mill. It was built with a capital of ¬£70,000. It opened in May 1903 with 250 workers and 85,464. The Tudor Mill Company became part of the Atlas Mills Limited in the 1920s. Further mills built by the syndicate were Cedar Mill and finally the Texas Mill. The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Atlas Mills Limited was taken over by the LCC in 1929. Thus, Tudor Mill was one of 104 mills brought into LCC ownership, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950, though its spindleage had been reduced to 54,104. It closed in the 1960s and was used as a warehouse. It was destroyed by fire on 24 June 1970. Architecture This was a Sydney Stott building. It was six storeys high built on a basement. It was 11 bays long (65 m), and 40m wide with a corner water tower and a detached engine house. The chimney was round and displayed the two rings that were a trademark of a Sydney Stott mill. Power The steam engine was an 1800 hp triple expansion vertical engine by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw built in 1906. It had an 18-foot flywheel that operated at 75 rpm. The flywheel drove 40 ropes that transmitted the power to each floor. The cylinders all had Corliss valves. They had a 48\\" throw, the high pressure was 22¬Ω\\" in diameter, the intermediate was 34\\" and the low pressure was 56\\". The air pump was driven from the low-pressure crosshead, there was a Saxon governor on the high-pressure end of the bed. Equipment The preparation machinery was provided by Brookes and Doxey, and the mule frames by Hetherington and Sons Ltd.

The trio met at the University of California, San Diego in 2004 and produced a number of music videos and short films released on their website and later YouTube before establishing a professional media company, Sketchbook Media, after their graduation. Their works have been featured at a number of national and international film festivals, including the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, San Diego Asian Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival. As of June 2020, Wong Fu Productions' YouTube channel has over 3.29 million subscribers and over 573.2 million video views. History According to Philip Wang, Wong Fu Productions was unofficially established in 2001 during his high school junior year at Northgate High School (Walnut Creek, California). Wang mainly utilised his family's digital camcorder to film school projects in collaboration with classmates. In his first year as an undeclared freshman at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Wang and his friends released a music video of Justin Timberlake's song \\"Se√±orita\\". It was the first music video produced by Wang and, although he did not actively promote it, the video was quickly circulated among other fellow college students. The video was circulated in its original computer file format because it was released prior to the advent of the video sharing website YouTube. In 2004, Wang met classmates Wesley Chan (graduated from Mills High School in 2002) and Ted Fu through a school production, and the trio began working on small scale projects in their spare time and for class assignments. They did not originally consider filmmaking as a career when they entered university; Chan explored an interest in animation, Fu had been a student in electrical engineering and Wang considered a career in economics. After graduation in 2006, the three moved to the Los Angeles area and continued their venture under the professional name Sketchbook Media. After approximately five years, Wong Fu Productions garnered 1 million subscribers in 2011. On June 8, 2013, Wong Fu Productions celebrated their 10 year anniversary and produced a 13 minute short on June 29 featuring Christine Chen, the surrounding cast of Wong Fu, and many familiar faces, including Ryan Higa, Dominic Sandoval (D-Trix), Kevin Wu (KevJumba), Freddie Wong, Brandon Laatsch, Joe Penna (MysteryGuitarMan) and The Fung Brothers. On July 23, 2013 Wong Fu Productions launched a second channel titled \\"More Wong Fu\\" which is described as \\"Home of Lunch Break, WF Recess, Failed It, FIRST, bloopers, behind the scenes, and special features. It's, just.. more Wong Fu.\\" https://www.youtube.com/user/MoreWongFu/featured Wong Fu has begun to expand their team of creators. The current team includes Taylor Chan (senior editor), Jessica Lin (production coordinator), Benson Quach (editor and assistant director), Christopher Yang (editor and director of photography), and Jennifer Le (graphic design and social media). Former members include Regina Fang (production assistant), Christine Chen (producer), Kenson Lee (visual effects and music), Chris Dinh (screenwriter) and Ashley Matsunami (production coordinator).https://www.wongfuproductions.com/team/ On December 28, 2017 Wong Fu's second channel \\"More Wong Fu\\" released a lunch break revealing Matsunami would be leaving the team to venture out into new job opportunities.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBxPnipdU48 Notable productions Wong Fu Productions was initially known for its independent music videos of contemporary hit songs such as Maroon 5's \\"Sunday Morning\\" and Jason Mraz's \\"I'm Yours\\". Wong Fu released its first major short film called Yellow Fever on January 25, 2006. The film, which satirized the topic of interracial dating between Asian Americans and White Americans, brought Wong Fu into recognition among many college students in the United States. A Moment with You, the group's first feature-length film, premiered on June 3, 2006, at their alma mater. It was also screened at the San Diego Asian Film Festival on October 18, 2006. The film revolves around two neighbors who share similar romantic situations, in which one person in each relationship cannot let go of his or her past. \\"A Moment with You\\" was promoted through a screening tour at high schools and universities around the United States and Canada. In a review for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's student newspaper The Tech, Tina Ro wrote, \\"Despite its large Asian fan base, Wongfu's [sic] movie has a cast of equal numbers of Asians and Caucasians. Furthermore, all the characters were shaped by their own characteristics rather than by their race, a refreshing concept for a movie.\\" According to The Daily Texan's Katherine Fan, A Moment with You featured a \\"more mature, introspective mood than their previous work.\\" Following the success of A Moment with You, Wong Fu was approached to create a second film called Sleep Shift. However, the project was abandoned after producers disagreed with casting an Asian male in the film's lead role. Since the end of its first tour, Wong Fu has created music videos for rising artists and continued producing short films. The group's merchandise line, which included original T-shirt designs, was launched in conjunction with the 2007 film Just a Nice Guy. The short film The Spare was featured at the 2008 San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, and two additional short films‚ÄîAt Musing's End and A Peace of Home‚Äîwere shown at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Short Films Corner. In September 2009, Wong Fu released the short film Poser!, a mockumentary on the history of the peace sign. As of November 2009, Wong Fu Productions has created more than 130 short films and music videos. Because the group does not require a fee to view its films, it gains a salary from being a YouTube partner, draws profits from merchandise sales, public speaking on university campuses, and music video production for rising Asian American artists. In May 2010, Wong Fu Productions and Ryan Higa opened talks about creating a major film. The movie was filmed in a one-week period during the summer, and was released to the public on November 23, while being released on YouTube a day later as Agents of Secret Stuff. starring Ryan Higa and Arden Cho. On September 7, 2011, Wong Fu Productions announced that they have been hired by multiplatinum Taiwanese pop singer Wang Leehom to direct his upcoming music video \\"Still In Love With You\\". International Secret Agents In the addition to the group's filmmaking career, Wong Fu Productions has organized a series of multidisciplinary concerts in California. The concert series, International Secret Agents (ISA), featured musical disciplines from urban dance to deejaying with Asian American guest artists such as Far East Movement. Additional guest performances included America's Best Dance Crew champions Quest Crew and Poreotics, Ryan Higa (aka Nigahiga), Kevin Wu (aka KevJumba), Jay Park, and singers‚Äìsongwriters David Choi and Kina Grannis. According to Chinese American rapper Jin, \\"ISA is about self-branding and viral marketing ‚Äî using YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, and the Internet to promote yourself as an artist.\\" He asserted, \\"We as artists are aware of this and make ourselves available [on these mediums].\\" Far East Movement member Virman Coquia said, \\"We want to give back to the community to show that Asians can have an influence today in the U.S.\\" Additionally, Coquia believed that ISA presented the opportunity to present Asian American talent as cool and mainstream. The first ISA concert was held in September 2008 at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse in Los Angeles. A second concert was held in March 2009 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and both events were attended by a sold- out crowd. The concert returned to Los Angeles in September 2009 and was sponsored by department store J. C. Penney. In 2010, ISA was held in New York City for the first time. Wong Fu has also expressed interest in holding future ISA concerts in Washington, D.C. They also had another ISA concert in Los Angeles on September 5. Playing up the name \\"International Secret Agents,\\" The LA leg of the 2010 ISA Concert was filled with surprises as secret guests like Nick Cannon showed up to join the performers on stage. On March 30, 2013, ISA held and filmed their first game show at YouTube Space Los Angeles. The event had several famous YouTubers including Anthony Lee, Brandon Laatsch, Clara C, David Choi, Freddie Wong, Jen Chae Buescher(FrmHeadToToe), Mike Song, Ted Fu, Wesley Chan as players, Kevin Wu as the gamemaster named Yoshi, and Amy Okuda and Philip Wang as the hosts. Everything Before Us Everything Before Us is the first feature film of Wong Fu Productions. Released 23 April 2015 over Vimeo, the film was directed by Phillip Wang and Wesley Chan. The film tells the story of two couples in the near future where the Department of Emotional Integrity (D.E.I.) issues 'relationship scores', somewhat like a credit score, that affect couples' everyday choices. With a nearly all-Asian cast, some of its stars include Aaron Yoo, Brittany Ishibashi, Brandon Soo Hoo, Victoria Park, Randall Park, and Ki Hong Lee. Funding for the film was crowd-sourced from Wong Fu's fans via Indiegogo, and the film's premiere release was held at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival. Single By 30 On August 24, 2016, Wong Fu Productions released its first studio-funded project Single by 30, an 8-episode web series starring Harry Shum Jr. and Kina Grannis, on YouTube Red. Described by NPR as an \\"old-fashioned romantic comedy\\", the series has been praised for its highly diverse cast as it reflected the diverse population of Los Angeles, where the series is set in. Just Another Nice Guy On August 9, 2017 Wong Fu Productions launched a mini series titled Just Another Nice Guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU58jrx4pXs \\"Just Another Nice Guy\\" or \\"JANG\\" for short is a 3 episode web series and sequel to \\"Just A Nice Guy\\" which was released in 2007 and was one of the company's first videos.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMSixENoid4 The series stars Motoki Maxted, Piper Curda, Krista Marie Yu, and Will Pacarro.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7843014/  Yappie  \\"Yappie\\" is a 5-episode video series on YouTube that addresses the modern Asian American experience and the model minority myth. Yappie is a slang term for \\"young Asian professional\\". The video series stars Phillip Wang and Janine Oda, whose relationship puts them face to face with racial and social problems. Kim's Convenience star Simu Liu has a major supporting role. The series reflects Wong Fu Production's of bringing Asian American representation to the screen, while staying true to their mission of storytelling. The series is funded through the support of Patreon supporters, which is part of Wong Fu Production's new Wong Fu Forward goals to be a platform for artists and to create longer video series. Impact Short films released by Wong Fu Productions have received, cumulatively, millions of views, and the group has several thousand fans. According to Wang, the group's website received 5,000 daily hits in 2009. He expected the audience size to grow \\"as online video becomes part of everyday life for the up-and-coming generation of movie- watchers\\" but believed that movie theaters will not become obsolete. University of Southern California digital media expert David Wertheimer also believed that \\"Wong Fu's use of new media to tell their community stories and build a business is the wave of the future.\\" The group's success has allowed for growth in the popularity of Asian American comedians who promote themselves primarily through YouTube, such as Kevin Wu (KevJumba), Ryan Higa (Nigahiga), Christine Gambito (HappySlip), and David Choi. Although grateful for the group's success and popularity, Wang said, \\"Some people who go to film school, they'll make something great but it's only seen by like, two hundred people [...] It's kind of not fair.\\" In a feature by CNN, newscaster Ted Rowlands reported that Wong Fu's primary audience were \\"young Asian Americans who often can't find accurate depictions of themselves in mainstream media\\". Through its films, Wong Fu Productions hoped to break the different stereotypes of Asian Americans. Despite this goal, Wong Fu's films were inspired by the members' life experiences rather than racial experiences. The group also does not promote political messages through their works but, rather, raises \\"many APA issues that we feel would fit our brand and image.\\" They are often considered role models for Asian Americans aspiring to enter the entertainment industry. In response to this, group member Ted Fu said, \\"We actually didn't set out to be the 'heroes' of Asian Americans. It just happened by accident. But now that we're given this huge responsibility, almost, I feel like it's our duty to take it seriously.\\" Wong Fu presented \\"one of the most antipicated workshops\\" on sustaining an independent production company at the 2008 Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association Midwest Conference. They were also the keynote speakers at the Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association 2010 West Coast Conference, which was hosted at their alma mater, UC San Diego. In February 2012, Wang and Chan flew from Los Angeles to Malaysia for the first leg of their Southeast Asia Tour, meeting and greeting over 1000 fans, even to a point of having a live radio appearance on the radio station HITZ fm. In July 2012, Chan gave the commencement speech at UC San Diego to the graduating class. In June 2016, Philip Wang gave the commencement speech at UCSD to its graduating class. In 2018, to continue creating content for their fans, Wong Fu created the Patreon page, Wong Fu Forward where supporters can directly fund Wong Fu Productions. By joining Patreon, Wong Fu hopes to continue its mission in storytelling, creating longer video series for their supporters on YouTube and acting as a platform for artists.

Islamic missionary work or dawah means to \\"invite\\" (in Arabic, literally \\"invitation\\") to Islam. After the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, from the 7th century onwards, Islam spread rapidly from the Arabian Peninsula to the rest of the world through either trade and exploration or Muslim conquests. In the early Islamic Empire (632‚Äì750) Following the death in 632 AD of Muhammad, Islam spread far and wide within a very short period, much of this occurring through an initial establishment and subsequent expansion of an Islamic Empire through conquest, such as that of North Africa and later Spain (Al-Andalus), and the Islamic conquest of Persia putting an end to the Sassanid Empire and spreading the reach of Islam to as far east as Khorasan, which would later become the cradle of Islamic civilization during the Islamic Golden Age and a stepping-stone towards the introduction of Islam to the Turkic tribes living in and bordering the area. The Arab Christian Bedouins embraced Islam following the wake of the Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah in which the Sassanids were routed. During the rule of Umar II and Al-Ma'mun, Islam gained numerous converts. During the Islamic Golden Age (750‚Äì1250) Following the initial establishment of the empire and stabilization of borders and ruling elites, various missionary movements emerged during the ensuing Islamic Golden Age, with the express purpose of preaching to the non-Muslim populations in their midst. These missionary movements also preached outside the borders of the Islamic empire taking advantage of the expansion of foreign trade routes, primarily into the Indo-Pacific and as far south as the isle of Zanzibar and the southeastern shores of Africa. In Persia, Islam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure.The Preaching of Islam: A History of the Propagation of the Muslim Faith by Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg.170‚Äì180 Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. Thomas Walker Arnold suggests that the Zoroastrian figures Ahura Mazda and Ahriman were equated with Allah and Iblis. In Afghanistan, Islam was spread due to Umayyad missionary efforts particularly under the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al- Malik and Umar ibn AbdulAziz. During the reign of Al-Mu'tasim Islam was generally practiced amongst most inhabitants of the region and finally under Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari, Islam was by far, the predominant religion of Kabul along with other major cities of modern-day Afghanistan. In Central Asia, Muslim leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer with promises of money and allowed the Quran to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all. Later, the Samanids, whose roots stemmed from Zoroastrian theocratic nobility, propagated Sunni Islam and Islamo-Persian culture deep into the heart of Central Asia. The population within its areas began firmly accepting Islam in significant numbers, notably in Taraz, now in modern-day Kazakhstan. The first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred during the reign of Samanids in the 9th century. According to historians, through the zealous missionary work of Samanid rulers, as many as 30,000 tents of Turks came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids higher than 55,000 under the Hanafi school of thought.The History of Iran by Elton L. Daniel, pg. 74 In the 9th century, the Ismailis sent missionaries across Asia in all directions under various guises, often as traders, Sufis and merchants. Ismailis were instructed to speak to potential converts in their own language. Some Ismaili missionaries traveled to India and employed effort to make their religion acceptable to the Hindus. For instance, they represented Ali as the tenth avatar of Vishnu and wrote hymns as well as a mahdi purana in their effort to win converts. In 922 the Volga Bulgars were converted to Islam during the missionary work of Ahmad ibn Fadlan‚Äîan act with considerable influence on the later history of the Mongol Empire and of Russia, since the Kipchaks who later conquered the area accepted Islam from these earlier converts, eventually fusing to become the Muslim Tatar people. Following the Mongol conquests (1200‚Äì1450) Genghis Khan's grandson, Berke, was one of the first Mongol rulers to convert to Islam. He was converted by Saif ud-Din Dervish, a dervish from Khorazm. Later, it was the Mamluk ruler Baibars who played an important role in bringing many Golden Horde Mongols to Islam. Baibars developed strong ties with the Mongols of the Golden Horde and took steps for the Golden Horde Mongols to travel to Egypt. The arrival of the Golden Horde Mongols to Egypt resulted in a significant number of Mongols accepting Islam.Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 192 By AD 1330's three of the four major khanates of the Mongol Empire had become Muslim.The Encyclopedia Americana, By Grolier Incorporated, pg. 680 With the conquest of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks, missionaries would find easier passage to the lands then formerly belonging to the Byzantine Empire. In the earlier stages of the Ottoman Empire, a Turkic form of Shamanism was still widely practiced in Anatolia, which soon started to give in to the mysticism offered by Sufism. The teachings of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, who migrated from Khorasan to Anatolia, are good examples of the mystical aspect of Sufism. During the Ottoman Empire (1400‚Äì1900) During the Ottoman presence in the Balkans, missionary movements were also taken up by people from aristocratic families hailing from the region, who had been educated in Constantinople or any other major city within the Empire, in famed madrassahs and kulliyes. Most of the time, such individuals were sent back to the place of their origin, being appointed to important positions in the local governing body. This approach often resulted in the building of mosques and local kulliyes for future generations to benefit from, as well as spreading the teachings of Islam. Thomas Walker Arnold says that Islam was not spread by force in the areas under the control of the Ottoman Sultan. Rather Arnold concludes by quoting a 17th-century author who stated: > Meanwhile he (the Turk) wins (converts) by craft more than by force, and > snatches away Christ by fraud out of the hearts of men. For the Turk, it is > true, at the present time compels no country by violence to apostatise; but > he uses other means whereby imperceptibly he roots out Christianity...Sir > Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 136 In Africa Seven years after the death of Muhammad (in 639 AD), the Arabs advanced toward Africa and within two generations, Islam had expanded across North Africa and all of the Central Maghreb.Hussein D. Hassan.\\"Islam in Africa\\" (RS22873). Congressional Research Service (May 9, 2008). In the following centuries, the consolidation of Muslim trading networks, connected by lineage, trade, and Sufi brotherhoods, had reached a crescendo in West Africa, enabling Muslims to wield tremendous political influence and power. During the reign of Umar II, the then Governor of Africa, Ismail ibn Abdullah, was said to have won the Berbers to Islam by his just administration. Other early notable missionaries include Abdallah ibn Yasin, who started a movement which caused thousands of Berbers to accept Islam.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg.125-261 Islam was introduced to the Horn of Africa early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra. At Muhammad's urging, a group of persecuted Muslims were received at the court of the Ethiopian Christian King A·π£·∏•ama ibn Abjar, a migration known as the first Hijarat.Rafiq Zakaria (1991) Muhammad and The Quran, New Delhi: Penguin Books, pp. 403‚Äì04. Zeila's two- mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn was built during this period in the 7th century, and is the oldest mosque in the city. In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard. He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city, suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th centuries. On the African Great Lakes coast, Islam made its way inland, spreading at the expense of traditional African religions. This expansion of Islam in Africa not only led to the formation of new communities in Africa, but it also reconfigured existing African communities and empires to be based on Islamic models. Indeed, in the middle of the eleventh century, the Kanem Empire, whose influence extended into Sudan, converted to Islam. At the same time but more toward West Africa, the reigning ruler of the Bornu Empire embraced Islam. As these kingdoms adopted Islam, their populace thereafter devotedly followed suit. In praising the Africans' zealousness to Islam, the fourteenth-century explorer Ibn Battuta stated that mosques were so crowded on Fridays, that unless one went very early, it was impossible to find a place to sit. In the sixteenth century, the Ouaddai Empire and the Kingdom of Kano embraced Islam, and later toward the eighteenth century, the Nigeria based Sokoto Caliphate led by Usman dan Fodio exerted considerable effort in spreading Islam. The spread of Islam towards Central and West Africa has been prominent. Previously, the only connection to such areas was through Transsaharan trade, of which the Mali Empire, consisting predominantly of African and Berber tribes, stands as a strong proof of the early Islamization of the Sub-Saharan region. The gateways prominently expanded to include the aforementioned trade routes through the Eastern shores of the African continent. With the European colonization of Africa, missionaries were almost in competition with the European Christian missionaries operating in the colonies. Islam is currently the second largest religion in Africa , mainly concentrated in North and Northeast Africa, as well as the Sahel region. In South Asia=Early missionary activity (750‚Äì1550) Muslim missionaries played a key role in the spread of Islam in India with some missionaries even assuming roles as merchants or traders. For example, in the 9th century, the Ismailis sent missionaries across Asia in all directions under various guises, often as traders, Sufis and merchants. Ismailis were instructed to speak potential converts in their own language. Some Ismaili missionaries traveled to India and employed effort to make their religion acceptable to the Hindus. For instance, they represented Ali as the tenth avatar of Vishnu and wrote hymns as well as a Mahdi purana in their effort to win converts. At other times, converts were won in conjunction with the propagation efforts of rulers. According to Ibn Batuta, the Khaljis encouraged conversion to Islam by making it a custom to have the convert presented to the Sultan who would place a robe on the convert and award him with bracelets of gold.Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 212 During Ikhtiyar Uddin Bakhtiyar Khilji's control of the Bengal, Muslim missionaries in India achieved their greatest success, in terms of number of converts to Islam.Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 227‚Äì228 During the Mughal Empire (1550‚Äì1750) Muslim missionaries across India received a significant moral boost with the formation of the Mughal Empire in Northern India in the sixteenth century. However, the empire evolved into a mixed blessing for Islamic missionary work, with its two most powerful rulers taking a somewhat diametrically opposite view of religion. Initially, Akbar the Great chose to follow a form of inter-faith dialogue somewhat contrary to the views of the traditional clergy, a stratagem that was to be totally reversed by his great-grandson Aurangzeb half a century later. During the colonial era (1750‚Äì1947) With the decline of the Mughals and a vast majority of the Muslim lands coming under the rule of the European colonial powers, Islamic missionary activity faced a new challenge, vis-a-vis Christian missionaries that arrived along with the colonial rulers. It was said that much of Muslim missionary zeal in India arose to counteract the anti-Muslim tendencies of Christian missionaries and thus, Islamic missionary effort was defense rather than direct proselytizing. The influence of Christian schools has caused significant interest among younger Indian and South Asian Muslims to study their faith, consequently sparking religious zeal. Moreover, some Muslims have adopted propagation methods of Christian missionaries such as street preaching. In modern era (1947‚Äìpresent) After the independence of Pakistan in 1947 there has been revival of Dawa in the country. Baba Deen Mohammad Shaikh mission has converted over 110,000 Hindus to Islam in Pakistan.100,000 conversions and counting, meet the ex-Hindu who herds souls to the Hereafter In Southeast Asia=In Indonesia The first Indonesians to adopt Islam are thought to have done so as early as the eleventh century, although Muslims had visited Indonesia early in the Muslim era. The spread of Islam was driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago; in general, traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were the first to adopt the new religion. Dominant kingdoms included Majapahit Kingdom in Central Java, and the sultanates of Ternate and Tidore in the Maluku Islands to the east. By the end of the thirteenth century, Islam had been established in North Sumatra; by the fourteenth in northeast Malaya, Brunei, the southern Philippines and among some courtiers of East Java; and the fifteenth in Malacca and other areas of the Malay Peninsula. Through assimilation Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. At this time, only Bali retained a Hindu majority and the outer islands remained largely animist but would adopt Islam and Christianity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Malaysia Islam was also brought to Malaysia by Indian Muslim traders in the 12th century AD. It is commonly held that Islam first arrived in Malay peninsular since Sultan Mudzafar Shah I (12th century) of Kedah (Hindu name Phra Ong Mahawangsa), the first ruler to be known to convert to Islam after being introduced to it by Indian traders who themselves were recent converts. In China Hui Muslims are the majority Muslim group in China. The greatest concentration is in Xinjiang, with a significant Uyghur population. Lesser but significant populations reside in the regions of Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai. Various sources estimate different numbers of adherents with some sources indicating that 1-3% of the total population in China are Muslims. Most of the significant population of Muslims in China is a result, not of missionary activity, but of trade links forged between various Muslim Caliphates with various Chinese dynasties over the centuries. In addition, often Chinese rulers would encourage flourishing of Muslim minority communities as buffers against local Chinese enemies and as a source for loyal military recruits. According to Chinese Muslims' traditional legendary accounts, Islam was first introduced to China in 616-18 AD by Sahaba (companions) of Prophet Muhammad : Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas, Sayid, Wahab ibn Abu Kabcha and another Sahaba.Dru C. Gladney, Muslim Tombs & Ethnic Folklore-Hui Identity, in The Journal of Asian Studies, California, vol.16, No.3, Aug. 1987, p. 498, p. 498 nt.8. Wahab ibn abu Kabcha (Wahb abi Kabcha) may have been be a son of al-Harth ibn Abdul Uzza (also known as Abu Kabsha).Safi-ur Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri, 2009, Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum: The Sealed Nectar: Biography of the Noble Prophet, Madinah: Islamic University of Al-Madinah al- Munawwarah, page 72: The Prophet was entrusted to Halimah...Her husband was Al-Harith bin Abdul Uzza called Abi Kabshah, from the same tribe It is noted in other accounts that Wahab Abu Kabcha reached Canton by sea in 629 CE. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, along with three Sahabas, namely Suhayla Abuarja, Uwais al- Qarani, and Hassan ibn Thabit, returned to China from Arabia in 637 by the Yunan-Manipur-Chittagong route, then reached Arabia by sea.Maazars in China- www.aulia-e-hind.com/dargah/Intl/Chin Some sources date the introduction of Islam in China to 650 AD, the third sojourn of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, when he was sent as an official envoy to Emperor Gaozong during Caliph Uthman's reign.Abul-Fazl Ezzati, 1994, The Spread of Islam, Tehran: Ahlul Bayt World Assembly Publications, pp. 300,303, 333. Imam Asim, also spelt Hashim, is said to have been one of the first Islamic missionaries in the region of China. He was a man of c.1000 CE in Hotan. A shrine site includes the reputed tomb of the Imam, a mosque, and several related tombs. In Europe Islamic missionary activity within the borders of Europe falls broadly into four different phases. In Medieval Spain The first phase covers the period of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 to 1031. Following this conquest, the Umayyads of C√≥rdoba promoted Islam in their newly conquered territories of what are today the modern-day European states of Spain and Portugal. Large numbers of local inhabitants converted to Islam as a result. During the Crusades The second phase covers the period of the Crusades from 1095 - 1291 along the eastern borders of Europe, whereby little or no Islamic missionary activity occurred in Europe due to the on-going conflict between Christian Europe and the adjoining Muslim Caliphates. In Eastern Europe The third phase covers the period of 1362 - 1926 in Eastern Europe following the establishment of the Ottoman Caliphate. The conquest of significant territories in Eastern Europe by the Ottomans allowed Muslim missionaries to now operate in hitherto strictly Christian areas inside Europe. Some regions became entirely Muslim as a result, such as the modern day European states of Albania and Bosnia. In Western Europe With the Ottoman Caliphate in a seemingly constant military conflict with Western Europe at their mutual borders, missionary activity in Western Europe was virtually non-existent until the dramatic changing of the European political map in the 20th century. This along with the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the same time frame paved way for a subsequent mass immigration of Muslim peoples from the Muslim World into Western Europe after World War I. With the arrival of this new immigrant population, Islamic missionary activity in Western Europe soon followed thereafter. In North America Islamic Dawah Center in Houston, Texas The Muslim population in the United States has increased vastly since 1950, with growth driven by both conversion as well as immigration.A NATION CHALLENGED: AMERICAN MUSLIMS; Islam Attracts Converts By the Thousand, Drawn Before and After Attacks The conversion to Islam of most converts in North America can be attributed to several distinct, yet symbiotic, missionary activities. Nation of Islam Black supremacist group Nation of Islam's efforts to recruit members to its fold would be the earliest example of Islamic missionary activity in the United States. While considered a heretic branch of Islam, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Nation of Islam was the main source of information about Islam available to most Americans. As such, the Nation of Islam has been the single most important factor behind the subsequent widespread adoption of the more orthodox Sunni Islam in the African-American community. Many former Nation of Islam members have gone on to become major figures in the large African- American Muslim presence in North America, such as Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad's own son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Muslim immigrants and their missionary implications A major push for Islamic missionary work in North America occurred when large numbers of educated professional Muslim immigrants as well as higher-education seeking foreign Muslim students began to arrive in Canada and the United States in the early 1970s. The arrival of these new immigrants coincided with a growing curiosity about Islam among the American public in the late 1970s, following political events in the Muslim World, which had been up until this point, somewhat invisible from the American public's consciousness. However, the Middle East oil crisis of 1973, the Iranian Revolution in 1979, followed by the beginning of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in 1980 dramatically raised the profile of Islam and Muslims in the North American media. The new wave of Muslim immigrants were thus well-placed to begin a variety of small-scale missionary efforts across their communities to inform their fellow Americans about their religion.Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad (1993). The Muslims of America. Oxford University Press, USA. In prison systems A more recent missionary front has been the US prison system, where encouragement of religious study has opened an avenue for Muslims to promote their religion. There is an increasing trend towards hiring of full-time Muslim chaplains to cater to increasing populations of Muslim prisoners in large urban areas.Ranks of Latinos Turning to Islam Are Increasing; Many in City Were Catholics Seeking Old Muslim Roots J. Michael Waller claims that Muslim inmates comprise 17-20% of the prison population in New York, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. He also claims that 80% of the prisoners who \\"find faith\\" while in prison convert to Islam. Saudi-financed missionary work With the burgeoning Muslim population in North America by the late 1980s, numerous missionary outlets saw an opportunity to receive financing for their missionary work from various Saudi- based religious foundations as well as influential private Saudi citizens. This phenomenon, which flourished for much of the decade of the 1990s, came to an abrupt end following the events of the September 11 attacks. Some of the works undertaken at the time included: * Mass distribution of A Brief Illustrated Guide to Understanding Islam () a high quality color booklet widely available at missionary outlets. * Mass distribution of the complete Yusuf Ali translation The Meaning of the Holy Qur'an. Tens of thousands of the US Amana Publications edition () were available for free at missionary outlets across North America during the 1990s. These were printed under the auspices of the Iqraa Charitable Society of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. * Issuing of numerous scholarships, especially to African-American converts during the early 1990s, for 2-5 year courses of Islamic studies at various Islamic universities in Saudi Arabia. * Supporting local efforts in building mosques. The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in Rome represent two of Saudi Arabia's largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud contributed US$8 million and US$50 million to the two mosques, respectively. Missionary activity by specialists With the increasing population of Muslims in North America, a number of specialist missionaries have emerged, focusing primarily on missionary work in North America. The more well-known of these Muslim missionaries include: * Ahmed Deedat, South African preacher who visited North America on several occasions in the 1980s to debate Christian contemporaries and lecture on Christian-Muslim dialogue. * Jamal Badawi, Canadian-Egyptian professor, who has been very active in Christian-Muslim dialogue for over 30 years. * Shabir Ally, international speaker and very active missionary with his own weekly TV show that airs in Canada. * Zakir Naik of India is the founder of a vast missionary organization, Islamic Research Foundation (IRF), under whose auspices he produces numerous audio-visual missionary material for worldwide distribution. He often invites well-known North American converts for speaking tours to India. * Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips a convert to Islam, originally from Canada, is one of the earliest and most famous public figures to speak on missionary themes in North America. He has published numerous books on Islam, and Islamic studies for new Muslims, over the past 30 years to supplement his public preaching. * Yusuf Estes, a former Protestant and now self-styled \\"American-Muslim chaplain\\" is very active in missionary work, with special focus on online missionary activity. Muslim celebrity missionary impact With the power asserted by the celebrity culture of North America, the presence of several high-profile Muslim converts in the sports and arts celebrity scene has resulted in unintended but significant missionary consequences. * Muhammad Ali has been, by far, the biggest Muslim celebrity in the American public consciousness, not only as a pre-eminent sportsperson, but also for his greater than life persona. Originally a member of the Nation of Islam, he later made the transition to more orthodox Sunni Islam and became an active Muslim missionary after he contracted Parkinson's disease. He has been known to often pass out material on Islam to fans and the general public when approached at airports, restaurants and other public places. * Malcolm X, the public face of the Nation of Islam during much of the tumultuous late 1950s and early 1960s, has since been identified as one of the most important African-American leaders of the past century. His celebrity aside, he made an even more direct contribution to Islamic missionary activity in North America with his book The Autobiography of Malcolm X which in 1998, Time named as one of the ten most influential non-fiction books of the 20th century. * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, originally Lew Alcindor Jr., was a stand-out college basketball player, who converted to Islam soon after turning pro. Changing his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he was to remain in the public limelight for well over a decade thereafter with a Hall of Fame pro career as a member of the high- profile multiple championship winning Los Angeles Lakers teams of the 1980s. * Yusuf Islam, originally known as Cat Stevens, an English musician with multiple platinum hits to his credit, while he was still in his 20s, famously converted to Islam in 1977 following years of spiritual awakening and initially renounced his musical career altogether, not only changing his name, but also actively promoting Islam in public thereafter. * Hakeem Olajuwon, a prominent Nigerian-American basketball player, who won the NBA championships twice in 1994‚Äì95 as a member of the Houston Rockets, publicly acknowledged a renewed interest in his Islamic roots early in his pro career. He also represented the United States National Basketball team at the Olympics, as a naturalized US citizen, during the later part of his career.

Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten in 1879. The type species, B. adusta, was originally described as Boletus adustus by Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1787. The generic name honours Swedish naturalist Clas Bjerkander. Karsten included seven species in addition to the type: B. dichroa, B. amorpha, B. fumosa, B. kymatodes, B. diffusa, and B. isabellina. Most of those species have been since moved to different genera or synonymized. In a 1913 survey of polypore genera, Adeline Ames included B. adusta, B. fumosa, and B. puberula; the latter fungus is now placed in Abortiporus. Marinus Anton Donk included only B. adusta and B. fumosa in a 1974 publication. Some authors have suggested to merge these two species into other genera, such as Gloeoporus, Tyromyces, or Grifola. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the two traditional Bjerkandera fungi form a monophyletic group that is sister to the crust fungus Terana coerulea. The little-known Cuban species B. subsimulans and B. terebrans, both originally described by Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis, were transferred to Bjerkandera by William Alphonso Murrill in 1907, and are accepted as valid species by Index Fungorum. Bjerkandera atroalba and B. centroamericana are two neotropical species that were transferred to Bjerkandera, and described as new, respectively, in 2015. Description Bjerkandera fumosa The fruit bodies of Bjerkandera fungi have soft and pliable caps with an upper surface texture ranging from finely hairy to smooth. The pore surface on the undersurface of the cap ranges from grey to black or buff to greyish brown. The tubes are the same colour. A dark, denser zone is typically present between tubes and the context, which is usually white to buff. The hyphal system in Bjerkandera is monomitic, containing only generative hyphae. These hyphae have clamps, and are thin to thick-walled. Cystidia are absent from the hymenium. The spores of Bjerkandera are smooth with a short cylindrical shape, thin-walled, and do not react in Melzer's reagent.

Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1945, with Daedalea philippinensis as the type species. This fungus was originally described by French mycologist Narcisse Th√©ophile Patouillard] in 1915 as Daedalea philippinensis. Description Fruit bodies of Diacanthodes fungi have circular caps that may be partially funnel-shaped (infudibuliform), and a surface texture ranging from tomentose (covered with densely entangled hairs) to strigose (with stiff, sharp-pointed hairs). The colour of the pore surface is light brown, but it darkens with time. Diacanthodes has a dimitic hyphal system, meaning it contains both generative hyphae and skeletal hyphae. The generative hyphae have clamp connections; the skeletal hyphae are thick-walled to solid, and have a weak dextrinoid reaction. The spores are broadly ellipsoid, ornamented, and dextrinoid. Leif Ryvarden suggests that Bondarzewia may be the genus most closely related to Diacanthodes, based on morphological similarities. Both genera feature ornamented spores, the same hyphal system, and similar habit. They differ in microscopic characteristics: Bondartzewia fungi have clampless generative hyphae, no cystidia, and amyloid spores. Habitat and distribution Diacanthodes has a pantropical distribution. Its fruit bodies occur on the ground. Species *Diacanthodes fluminensis Corner (1989) *Diacanthodes griseus Corner (1989) *Diacanthodes novoguineensis (Henn.)

The genus was circumscribed by mycologists Kurt Hjorstam and Leif Ryvarden in 1978 with the European fungus U. luteolum as the type species. The South American species U. roseocremeum was added to the genus in 2012. The distinguishing feature of Uncobasidium is the basal hook in the basidium. Description Uncobasidium forms a crust-like fruit body, which is spread out on the surface of the substrate. Its texture is softly membranous or byssoid (as if made of fibers). The hyphal system is monomitic, meaning it contains only generative hyphae. Individual hyphae are distinct when viewed with microscopy, and they range from thin to becoming thick walled, with clamp connections. The hyphae of the subiculum are usually straight and of uniform diameter. In contrast, the hyphae of the subhymenium are twisty and sometimes strongly bent. The basidia (pleurobasidia) are roughly urniform (swollen at the base). They are strongly constricted with a hook-shaped appendage, arising in the basal septum, with four sterigmata. The spores of Uncobasidium fungi are ellipsoid to obovate in shape, thin walled, and non-amyloid.

It consists of a website, a syndicated radio show, and a weekly TV show that offers exposure to songs and artists with the vision of providing \\"context, perspective, recommendation and discovery of music that‚Äôs new (or new to you).\\" ExploreMusic achieves this through artist interviews, exclusive performances, music news, album reviews, and lists of recommended songs that are presented on a daily and weekly basis. The program was first broadcast on 6 October 2008, and is heard on radio stations across Canada. It has a weekly audience of approximately one million. The program is also syndicated in the United States. A television adaptation of the program currently airs on Aux. Creation Prior to the launch of ExploreMusic, there had been a number of discussions within Corus about the need to update the concept of the radio DJ as the trusted filter for new music. With online being the first choice of more and more people looking for new music, the decision was made to create a service where \\"real people, real passionate music fans, could recommend music to other real passionate music fans, without any sort of mechanical or electronic filters.\\" The concept was inspired by the success of Pandora and Last.fm. However, while Pandora and Last.fm work on complex algorithms, ExploreMusic was designed as a place where music fans could turn to discover new music and information about the artists involved, as well as be encouraged to make recommendations themselves with the goal of creating conversation and community. On 1 July 2008, Alan Cross, the host of The Ongoing History of New Music and former Program Director of Toronto radio station 102.1 The Edge, took the position of senior program director at Corus Interactive and Integrated Solutions (then known as Splice). Planning and development continued through the summer. The program was first broadcast on 6 October 2008 on 102.1 The Edge in Toronto, Y108 in Hamilton, FM96 in London, Power 97 in Winnipeg, and The Fox in Vancouver. The show has since been included on Live 88.5 in Ottawa, Rock 101.9 in Cornwall, X92.9 in Calgary, SONiC 102.9 in Edmonton, and The Wolf 101.5 in Peterborough, Ontario, with plans to branch out to more affiliates in the future. The program began syndication in the United States after ExploreMusic partnered with Friday Morning Quarterback. It currently airs on two US radio stations, 103.3 The Edge in Buffalo, and X103 in Indianapolis. An estimated one million people listen to the program each week in Canada. Program Five thirty-minute radio shows are produced and distributed each week. Meetings to determine the program content are held once a week. Each person attending the meeting brings a list of five songs, two that have been newly released and three that are a year or more older. They discuss the tracks and decide which ones to use on the broadcast, and which to add to the website. Cross noted that \\"we're appreciative of everybody's diverse tastes. The whole idea is to introduce people to music that is new and new to them.\\" The programs are written and hosted by Alan Cross, and are recorded in Toronto, Ontario. The four pillars driving the show are context, perspective, recommendation, and discovery. Every song and story featured on ExploreMusic is created in accordance with those four pillars. The typical show content includes the \\"Big new song of the day\\", \\"The Music News Countdown\\", which contains the program‚Äôs top five music stories of the day, the music recommendation \\"The Five Songs You Gotta Hear Today\\", and an abbreviated interview with a musical artist, which frequently includes an exclusive performance of a song. In January 2009, ExploreMusic TV debuted on BiteTV, a Canadian digital tier channel aimed at males 18-34. Hosted by Cross, the programme is a weekly roundtable discussion on music issues with guests from various parts of the music industry. It currently airs on Aux, produced in cooperation with Corus Entertainment Inc. and GlassBOX Television Inc. The show is currently in its second season on the channel. Web content The topics and categories on the ExploreMusic radio show are also included on the website, often enhanced by links, images, additional text, audio, and video. The site is presented in blog format, with posts tagged as \\"News\\", \\"Reviews\\", \\"New Releases\\", \\"WTF\\", and other categories. ExploreMusic TV is seen through the website, as are audio and video podcasts of the previous shows. Every song featured on the website is linked to a sample of the track. The radio program is condensed into a daily podcast; music from the program is not included due to copyright restrictions, but the full interview with the musical artist is included. Web content is available on the BlackBerry and Windows Mobile through an application developed by Viigo Inc. This application allows users to access the ExploreMusic website and Alan Cross's Twitter posts.

It is located in Calipayan Road, Punta Tabuc, Roxas City, Capiz, Philippines. Originally named Mt. Carmel Family Life Learning Center, the school started as a preschool for indigent children at the residence of Atty. Virginia Pati√±o with only 8 students. It later transferred to its current site in Punta Tabuc after the school was able to purchase land and was able to receive a grant from a German foundation. History In response to the suggestion of Sor Paula Vargas of St. Anthony College Hospital to build a school for indigent children, Atty. Virginia Pati√±o founded Mount Carmel Family Life Learning Center with the solicited support and commitment of the religious and civic-spirited individuals of the Christian Family Movement In 1988, two rooms in the ground floor of Atty. Pati√±o's house were converted into improvised classrooms. Nursery and Kinder classes started with two teachers, Ms. Vivian Abagatnan and Ms. Ariza Villanueva who were later joined by Ms. Glosan Avelino. It started with eight children. three were indigent and five were paying. In the second year of operation, the number of students were more than doubled. Atty. Pati√±o spent a few months for compiling and consolidating document with pictures showing the actual situation of street children. These were sent to a foundation in Germany together with a project proposal. After almost a year or two, all the hard work, prayers and sacrifices of the people who worked hard for the school finally paid up with the response of Bund der Deutschen Katholischen Jugend Papstliches Mission Work der Kinder, a German foundation donated a substantial amount to the school. The Money was used for the construction of two buildings with four rooms each. The school site is actually a lot offered at a very low price by Mr. Candelario Pati√±o. The money from the sold lot was donated by the lot owner for the construction of the road going to the school. Later, an additional lot was donated by the same lot owner in exchange of the adjoining lot owned by Mrs. Paz Altavas where the road going to school lies. In this new site, the Preparatory class and the newly opened Grade 1 which was handled by Mrs. Gloria Andrada, were housed. Out of the solicited money, a second hand mini-school bus was bought and the rest were allocated for salaries and other operating expenses. From then on, one Grade was added after the other end of the every school year. More teachers were hired and more classrooms were built. Under the De La Salle Supervision In 1995, Our Lady of Mount Carmel Learning Center became a La Salle school under the supervision of the University of St. La Salle with Mrs. Norma Tagle as the supervisor. The elementary level was completed in 1997 and the first graduation ceremony was held in March 1997. June 1997 marked the inclusion of the first year High School for its courses. In June 2000, the Board of Trustees decided to turn over the management of its high school to the University of St. La Salle- Affiliate College (later renamed La Salle Affiliate College and then College of St. John-Roxas) due to the growing number of students and limited space of its school. Mount Carmel La Salle decided to retain and maintain its Pre- School and Grade School. In 2013, the school stopped the admission of new and existing students and turned over its operations to its sister school, College of St. John-Roxas. Its facilities and campus in Calipayan later became the third campus of Colegio de la Purisima Concepcion, which houses the second section of the elementary department.

It now a constituent part of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. History David Morris was born around 1745-6 and was the son of David Morris of the Ferry Inn at Llansteffan in Carmarthenshire.Early Banks in West Wales, by Francis Green (in West Wales Historical Records, The Annual Magazine of The Historical Society of West Wales, Volume VI, edited by Francis Green, Printed by W. Spurrell & Son, 1916) He was a Carmarthen merchant and in 1787 he became the Agent for Sir Herbert Mackworth and others, who had opened a banking house in Carmarthen.http://carmarthenshirehistorian.org/cgi- bin/twiki/view/Historian/CwmCoombACarmarthenshireHouseAndItsFamilies Retrieved 27 September 2009 By 1788 David Morris was working as a banker on his own account. In 1791 he took over a Carmarthen bank established by a person named David Parry and operated it under the name of Morris & Sonshttp://heritagearchives.rbs.com/wiki/David_Morris_&_Sons,_Carmarthen,_c.1790-1871 Retrieved 27 September 2009 David Morris carried-on his banking business in Dark Gate, Carmarthen. As the business expanded, it moved to a larger house in King Street and finally to Spilman Street, where the bank remained until it was taken over, in 1871. It is likely that David Morris also acquired the Carmarthen Furnace Bank, amalgamating the two banks to form a successful business carried on under the name David Morris & Sons and it was probably after the failure of Carmarthen Bank, which was owned by Waters, Jones & Co., that David Morris & Sons changed its name to Carmarthen Bank. David Morris died suddenly while on a visit to Swansea, on 25 September 1805, aged 59 years, and is buried at Saint Mary‚Äôs Church, Swansea. After his death the banking business was carried on by his sons. During the Panic of 1825 the Bank of England suspended cash payments, as a result of frequent provincial bank failures. This led to a general run on British banks, in December 1825. It is unclear if David Morris & Sons suffered during this crisis, but on 22 December 1825, a public meeting was held at the Guildhall, Carmarthen, where a vote of public confidence was passed in this bank and Waters, Jones & Co. A similar meeting was also held, on 26 December 1825, at Llandeilo. Takeover David Morris & Sons survived the Panic of 1825 and continued to operate successfully, until 28 November 1864, when the National Provincial Bank of England, Ltd., the pioneer of the big joint stock banks, first opened a branch in Carmarthen. On 2 October 1871, the banking business was transferred to the National Provincial Bank of England when the sons of David Morris retired. Successor in title David Morris & Sons is a past constituent of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, who hold the archives for the bank.

The steep, towering walls of McKittrick Canyon protect a rich riparian oasis in the midst of the Chihuahuan Desert. The majority of McKittrick Canyon is part of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, but is separated from the main park area and managed as a \\"day-use only\\" area with limited visitation hours. A large part of North McKittrick Canyon, though, is located in the Guadalupe Ranger District of Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico. Access to McKittrick Canyon is by a 4.2-mile (6.8-km) gated side road that leads to the mouth of McKittrick Canyon from U.S. Route 62/180. Here, the National Park Service maintains a parking area, restroom facilities, and visitor center, which is staffed most of the year by volunteers. McKittrick Canyon Trail McKittrick Canyon Trail begins at the visitor center and initially follows a dry stream, crossing the stream bed several times as it works its way up the canyon. At first, the vegetation is more typical of the Chihuahuan Desert with various species of yucca, agave, and cacti, such as Spanish dagger (Yucca faxoniana), sotol (Dasylirion leiophyllum), ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), century plants (Agave americana), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), and claret cup cacti (Echinocereus triglochidiatus). Scattered among these desert plants are a few hardy pines, junipers, and the occasional Texas madrone (Arbutus xalapensis), an unusual tree with red-colored bark that tends to curl up and peel off each year. As one ascends into the relatively cool and more sheltered environment farther up the canyon, a flowing stream of clear water appears and riparian vegetation becomes more abundant, including deciduous trees such as oak, ash, and bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum). During the fall, McKittrick Canyon comes alive with color from the turning foliage of maple and hardwood trees. The bright colors stand in stark contrast to the surrounding Chihuahuan Desert. After a distance of , the path reaches the Wallace Pratt Lodge that was built by Wallace Everette Pratt (1885-1981), a petroleum geologist who once owned most of McKittrick Canyon. In 1959, Pratt donated of his ranch to the National Park Service, and seven years later, on 15 October 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act establishing Guadalupe Mountains National Park. On 30 September 1972, Guadalupe Mountains National Park was dedicated and formally opened to the public. Farther up the canyon, the path becomes quite steep as it begins to follow a series of switchbacks, climbing nearly over the next , eventually reaching \\"the Notch\\" at an altitude around . From this high point, one can view McKittrick Canyon and the distant desert to the east and South McKittrick Canyon to the west.

It stretches northwards from the town of Helmstedt. The border between Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt runs through the woods, of which about three quarters is on Lower Saxon terrain. The Lappwald is part of the Elm-Lappwald Nature Park.  Location  The 1st Walbecker Warte, a watchtower on the Helmstedt dyke (Landwehr) Magdeburg watchtower near Helmstedt Watchtower on the former Inner German Border in the Lappwald The Lappwald runs from north-west to south-east parallel to the Elm hills, which lie about 10 km further west. The forests of the Lappwald are almost entirely uninhabited. The only settlements are the Helmstedt hamlet of Bad Helmstedt and the Harbke sector of Autobahn in the south, and the installations of the old airbase of Mariental in the north.  History  The first records describe the Lappwald as the Lapvualt in the year 1147.Hans-Ehrhard M√ºller: Helmstedt - die Geschichte einer deutschen Stadt, 2. Aufl. 2004, S. 184 There is no clear derivation for the name \\"Lappwald\\". The most likely theory is to do with the hunting term Einlappens. The Lappwald was a border forest for many centuries between the Brunswick and Prussian territories. Numerous smugglers and other criminals, including the well-known figure of \\"Robber Captain Rose\\" (R√§uberhauptmann Rose, real name: Carl Wallmann) used the forest's border situation to their advantage. In the 20th century the Inner German Border divided the Lappwald, following the old Brunswick-Prussian boundary. In the Lappwald northeast of Helmstedt are the remains of a defensive ditch forming part of the old dyke to Walbeck. The structures that have survived include two watchtowers from the 13th century which are referred to as the 1st and 2nd Walbeck Watchtowers (Walbecker Warte). Another well-preserved medieval watchtower is located immediately next to the B 1 federal road to Magdeburg on the edge of the Lappwald.  Geology  From a geological point of view, the Lappwald, which reaches a height of 211 m on the Heidberg, is a hollow, that only appears like a raised horst due to the sharply downfaulted terrain it is surrounded by. In the Cretaceous, a period of some 71 million years, the sea washed chalk, marls and sands in several flood phases into the Helmstedt and Sch√∂ppenstedt hollow and thus covered the underlying rock. Further flooding by the sea in the succeeding Tertiary era created large areas of bog in the Helmstedt Basin that were transformed under sub-tropical climatic conditions into massive brown coal deposits.

Life  Dohna was born at the Coppet Castle in Coppet near Geneva, one of the sons of Frederick of Dohna (1621‚Äì1688), Governor of the Principality of Orange, by his marriage to Sperentia du Puy Montbrun. He and his brother Alexander were educated privately by Pierre Bayle. Dohna joined the Prussian Army in 1670 and was promoted Captain in 1680. He fought in Hungary in 1686 in the Great Turkish War and became a Colonel of the Grands Mousquetaires on 20 October 1686. In 1692 he fought in the Nine Years' War against France, rising to command a regiment of infantry and being promoted Major General in 1698. The same year, he was sent on a diplomatic mission to England. In 1704, he came into conflict with Johann Kasimir Kolbe von Wartenberg and lost much of his influence at the Prussian Royal Court, but returned after Kolbe's dismissal. In 1711 Dohna was the Prussian envoy at the election of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and was promoted General of Infantry by Frederick I of Prussia in 1713. Dohna became the Amtshauptmann of Prussian Holland and took part in the Siege of Stralsund in 1715. He retired on 10 February 1716 and returned to his estates in East Prussia. Dohna married a cousin, Frede (Frederica) Marie von Dohna (28 December 1660 - 22 November 1729) on 18 November 1690. Their sons William Alexander (1695‚Äì1749) and Christopher II were also Prussian generals.

The hall was fitted with a large and well-appointed lodge room, a banquet hall, and numerous smaller rooms. History The Odd Fellows Block is architecturally significant in that it is one of two remaining Richardsonian Romanesque buildings extant in Grand Forks along with the St John's Block. These buildings were, along with the now demolished Security Building, the most impressive in Grand Forks in the late 19th century. The south (principal) and west elevations of the building feature cream brick towers framing recessed red brick bays along with stone details and decorative brick panels. Visible above the roof is a large wire frame skylight, now covered over with tar paper, which once lit the meeting hall below. The second floor apartments date to the original construction. The Odd Fellows Block played a significant role in the social and civic life of Grand Forks in the last decades of the 19th century serving as a meeting place for three Odd Fellows' lodges and the Daughters of Rebekah, as well as for lodges of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Knights of the Maccabees, the Order of Foresters, the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Royal Arcanum.

Description  L. brevicorne can grow up to 30 centimetres (1 ft) in diameter. It can adopt various shapes ranging from globose and inflated to low and flattened. It has a well-developed base and a short, smooth column. The wide oral disc overhangs the column and is covered with a very large number of short tentacles arranged in whorls. There is a sphincter muscle at the base of each tentacle which can be contracted in order to jettison the tentacle.Liponema KU Natural History Museum. Retrieved 2011-09-10.D. F. Dunn and G. J. Bakus, Redescription and ecology of Liponema brevicornis (McMurrich, 1893), with definition of the family Liponematidae, Astarte, 1977.  Distribution and habitat  L. brevicorne is found in deep water in the north east Pacific Ocean. The depth range is said to be 100 to 1000 metres (330 to 3,300 ft) but it has been found at much greater depths. Large numbers were observed at the site of a whale carcase that had sunk to the sea floor at 3000 metres (10,000 ft). These anemones are typically found unattached on muddy, sandy and gravelly sediments but also occur near deep water hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.Redescription and ecology of Liponema brevicornis (McMurrich, 1893), with definition of the family Liponematidae (Coelenterata, Actiniaria) Retrieved 2011-09-10. Biology L. brevicorne is a predator and scavenger. It uses its tentacles to capture plankton, small crustaceans, krill and other organic food particles floating past. Ecology Unusually for a sea anemone, L. brevicorne usually remains unattached to any solid substrate. Sometimes it rolls itself up and allows itself to drift with the current and roll across the seabed like tumbleweed before coming to rest against any solid object it encounters. In a study of a whale carcase that had fallen to the seafloor in Monterey Canyon, it was found that many specimens of L. brevicorne accumulated alongside. Associated with these were a large number of sea spiders in the class Pycnogonida. More than one of these was observed standing over an anemone with its proboscis inserted into the sea anemone's tentacle to suck out its body fluids. The anemone was not killed by this but afterwards had a somewhat deflated appearance. Other pycnogonids were observed to carry tentacles away, presumably to be consumed elsewhere.Sea spiders and pom-pom anemones Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Unit. Retrieved 2011-09-10.

The party was reformed in 1905 at the Second Congress of the RUP and was pursuing the Marxist ideology. The leaders of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party were Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Symon Petliura, Mykola Porsh, Dmytro Antonovych, Lev Yurkevych, Mykhailo Tkachenko, M. Kovalsky. In Soviet propaganda the party was identified as a petty bourgeoisie nationalistic party that was renamed as Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party to deceive people.Bachynskyi, P.

Vladimir Lenin characterized the party as \\"representatives of the most low-grade, stupid and reactionary nationalism\\" who betray \\"interest not only democracy in general, but its own fatherland, Ukraine\\". The Ukrainian social-democracy identified its priority by resolving national matter and pushing its struggle for social liberalization of working class to the secondary set. Yet in the spring of 1905 in his polemics with Dmytro Antonovych that was covered on pages of the party publishing Pratsia, Mykola Porsh argued his opinion about dependence of social and economic oppression from national. He insisted that for overcoming the social oppression foremost is necessary to solve the national issue.  History  With the ongoing Revolution of 1905 the party was reformed based on already existing Revolutionary Ukrainian Party (RUP) based from Kharkiv in December 1905 at the 2nd Party Congress of RUP. The party adopted the Erfurt Program of Social Democratic Party of Germany. In December 1905, the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labour Party (USLDP) decided to join the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, provided it was recognised as the sole representative of the Ukrainian proletariat, within the RSDLP. The Fourth (Unity) Congress of the RSDLP rejected the proposal which the USDLP spokesman had made for the immediate discussion of the terms of a merger, and referred the matter to the Central Committee for decision. At the USDLP party congress in June 1907 the party adopted its resolution that was similar to ultimatum urging RSDLP to recognize Ukrainian autonomy, Ukrainian Social-Democracy must have its representative in the Central Committee of RSDLP, and accept USDLP as the RSDLP's national organization of Ukrainian proletariat. No agreement was reached on a merger. Arguably, the reason that there was no merger was the fact that the USLDP, the UPSR, and the URLDP all favoured an independent Ukrainian state.http://www.ukemonde.com/murderbymoscow/petlura.html After the USDLP party congress in March 1907 its activity were semi-active. The party also closely worked with the Jewish Bund subsequently including the Ukrainian Jewish into the government of Ukraine; as well as other menshevik factions which altogether accounted for around 3,000 members. In 1908 the USDLP was suspended and many of its activist went into exile, particularly to the Austrian Galicia (today Western Ukraine). In 1915 in Ukraine was revived the party's central committee bureau in place of its regular central committee. In 1914 just before the World War I, a group of USDLP activist who went into exile and led by Dmytro Dontsov and Volodymyr Doroshenko joined the Galician social democrats, national democrats and radical to form the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine. The \\"Union\\" declared its loyalty to the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary and German Empire) considering that they could help Ukraine to free from the Russian domination. Another group on contrary supported the Tsarist Russia. Such position was held by an editor of published in Moscow newspaper Ukrainskaya zhyzn (Ukrainian life) Symon Petlyura and his supporters. The rest of members took an anti-war internationalist position. Such position of proletarian internationalism had been held by the USDLP abroad organization publishing in Geneva, newspaper Borotba (Fight). The party's activity was fully renewed in spring of 1917. After the February Revolution the party was the main party in the first Ukrainian government, the General Secretariat of Ukraine which was headed by the Volodymyr Vynnychenko (USLDP). Eventually it came into coalition with another party of Federalists (Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists), the proponent of the federalism with the Russian Republic and was in the opposition to the other truly nationalistically oriented parties in the country such as the Democratic Agrarian Party, the Union of Land Owners, and others. With time SDeky lost its popularity in favor of the Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party (SR) that worked together with the peasant representatives and gaining a rapid popularity amongst military formations within Ukraine. In 1918 together with several other Ukrainian parties formed the Ukrainian National Union that stayed in the opposition to the Hetmanate of Skoropadsky and later formed the Directory after defeat of the Hetman. After the IV Universal (Declaration of Independence) only two members of the party represented the party in the government (Dmytro Antonovych and Mykhailo Tkachenko). During the Soviet times the party was portrayed as nationalistic as it ideologically was for the wide autonomy of the Ukrainian lands.  Party's splits  There were at least two splits of the party. The first split occurred soon after revival of the party and invasion of the Russian revolutionary forces in December 1917 when its few left Ukrainian Social Democrats (LUSD) officially left the party and joined the Russian revolutionary forces. Among the notable members of LUSD was Yevhen Neronovych. Some members later became constituent members of the Communist Party of Ukraine. At the Fourth party Congress on January 10‚Äì12, 1919 the party had several members split again as nezalezhni (independent). Among the most prominent independists were Anatol Pisotsky, Vasyl and Yuriy Mazurenkos, Mykhailo Tkachenko, and others. They recognized the necessity of the dictatorship of proletriat and peace with Russia. The main faction consisting of Mykola Porsh, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Symon Petliura, Isaak Mazepa, and most of the party members opposed their ideas and were proposing the Labor Democracy, phased socialization of the main industries of People's Economy, and support of Direktoria. Later in 1920 those independent SDPists formed the Ukrainian Communist Party also known as UKPists as opposed to the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine. The independent SDPists (or Socialists-Sovereigns) were opposing the centrist tendency of the Moscow Communists parties, particularly the Bolsheviks. The Ukrainian Communist Party became a legal party of the Soviet Union.  In exile  As the government of Ukraine was emigrating into exile during the Russian-Ukrainian war of 1918‚Äì1919, a section of the USDLP was formed as the 'Foreign Delegation' of the party. During 1919 the party's Central Committee included Yosyp Bezpalko, Andriy Livytsky, Mykola Shadlun, and I. Romanchenko. At the party's conference September 9‚Äì13, 1919 in Vienna the Central Committee requested for its party members to withdraw out of the government. USDLP had members in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany and France, amongst other countries with the center in Prague. Isaak Mazepa was the secretary of the Foreign Delegation while other members of the Foreign Delegation included Yo. Bezpalko, Fedenko, I. Romanchenko, amongst others. The party began issuing publications: Socijalistyƒçna Dumko (published in Lviv and Prague), Vil'na Ukraina (Lviv) and Socijaldemokrat (published monthly from 1925 from Podƒõbrady). The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 ‚Äì 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 338 As of the early 1960s, Emil Wolynec was the acting chairman of the party, Panas Fedenko the general secretary and Bohdan Fedenko the youth secretary. Other executive committee members of the party were Antin Czerneckyj, Iwan Luczyszyn and Spyrydon Dovhal. The party had its headquarters in London. It published the monthly Nashe Slovo from London with Panas Fedenko as its editor. The party also issued the quarterly Vilna Ukraina from Detroit, with Mykola Nahirniak as its editor and Volodymyr Lysyj as its director. Vilna Ukraina and Nashe Slovo each had a circulation of around 1,000. Furthermore, there was a weekly newspaper (Narodna Volya) published from Scranton which was politically close to the party.Socialist International (1951- ), and Asian Socialist Conference.

It is one of the ten such Pontifical Academies established by the Holy See.GCath History In the 17th century, Pope Benedict XIV responded to public and Church interest in archaeology by establishing an association of students of Roman archaeology. Antonio Bosio's work on the catacombs had drawn the attention of international archaeologists to the early history of Christianity. In 1816 Pius VII, on the recommendation of Cardinal Consalvi, gave official recognition to the Accademia Romana di Archeologia and the academy became an important international centre of archaeological study. Its foreign members and lecturers included Barthold Georg Niebuhr, Johan David √Ökerblad, Bertel Thorvaldsen, as well as sovereigns Frederick William IV of Prussia and Charles Albert of Sardinia. Pope Pius VIII gave the Academy the title of \\"Pontifical Academy\\". In 1833 an attempt was made to remove the tomb of Raphael, but the Academy protested to Pope Gregory XVI and was successful. Later through the efforts of one of its members, the Academy was responsible for the restoration of the Tabularium on the Capitoline Hill. In the mid-19th century, the Academy became involved in a series of property rights disputes, as it hoped to prevent damage to monuments by restricting the rights of residents in low-cost housing near the Pantheon in Rome. It succeeded in obtaining from Pope Pius IX a decree for the demolition of the houses on the left side of the Pantheon; it also protested against the digging of new holes in the walls.

It is a deepwater species, being found at depths of . It is often found around deepwater corals, sitting on the coral branches or around coral mounds among the remains of dead corals. Biology Most deepwater echinoderms feed on algal debris and detritus. Examination of the gut contents of this species also showed small shells and the skeletons of hydroids. The eggs are small, which implies this species has echinopluteus larvae which are planktonic. Ecology A deepwater video survey of the seabed over the Cape Fear coral mound off North Carolina found the sea urchins E. tylodes and the rather similar Echinus gracilis associated with squat lobsters (Eumunida picta) and spider crabs (Rochinia crassa). These were living among the living and dead remains of the coldwater coral (Lophelia pertusa) from which the mound was largely formed. Other invertebrates present included the deepwater starfish (Novodinia antillensis) and the flytrap anemone (Actinoscyphia saginata).

(1931) Who‚Äôs Who In America, Vol. 16, 1930-1931 During her undergraduate studies she was motivated by Professor and Librarian George Lincoln Burr to pursue her own library degree. Mudge then went to Albany, New York, to attend the New York State Library School, where she received her ‚ÄúBachelor of Library Science degree with distinction in 1900‚Äù. She never married or had children. Librarian From her first job as a librarian, Mudge wanted library patrons to be able to access reference books and learn on an independent basis. Mudge‚Äôs first job was twofold; she ‚Äúwas the head reference librarian at the University of Illinois: Urbana and an associate professor at the University of Illinois Library School. For three years she maintained both positions. Mudge left the University of Illinois to become the head librarian at Bryn Mawr College. She considered herself an easterner and that may have been why she changed positions. She worked there for five years and spent the following three years working on writing, traveling to Europe, and from 1910 to 1911, Mudge also worked part-time as an instructor at Simmons College.John S. Bowman (1995) The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography; Cambridge University Press. Retrieved from http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Mudge,+Isadore+Gilbert Columbia University In 1911 Mudge was hired at Columbia University. The President of Columbia, Nicholas Murray Butler, became one of her earliest supporters. Butler found her ‚Äúincredibly resourceful in meeting his varied reference and bibliographic needs.‚Äù She began to push for all libraries to have a reference section that would include at least ‚Äúthe possession of certain basic works, a dictionary, an encyclopedia, an atlas, a biographical dictionary‚Äù but hopefully would also include ‚Äúa book of quotations, handbook of statistics, a state or government manual‚Äù. Around 1927 she began working as an associate professor at Columbia‚Äôs new School of Library Services, teaching Bibliography and Bibliographic Methods. It was teaching this class she coined her phrase ‚Äúmaterial, mind and method‚Äù. She believed reference librarians should know the materials they dealt with, be intelligent with a high quality memory and be able to answer questions in a clear way including the source of material they were using. One of her students published an article in a 1937 Library Journal sharing these ideas. ‚ÄúReviewing Mudge‚Äôs career at Columbia, Constance Mabel Winchell, Mudge‚Äôs prot√©g√©, said: ‚ÄòProbably no other one person has contributed so much to the raising the standards of reference collections and reference services in the libraries of this and other countries.‚Äô\\" Writing Around the time Mudge came to Columbia, the American Library Association asked her to update Guide to Reference Books, which was desperately needing a supplement to go along with the original edition. She edited the guide through four editions over 20 years. This was an important book at that time to show new librarians what resources were available. This is what she is best known for. She also wrote articles for the Library Journal, worked on editing and creating bibliographies, dictionaries and other reference materials. Quite often her writings were assisted by Minnie Earl Sears, a colleague and companion. Some of Mudge's writings are still found at Columbia University. Legacy Every year since 1958, RUSA, a division of the American Library Association, and the Gale Cengage Learning sponsor the Isadore Gilbert Mudge Award. The recipient is someone who has made a difference in reference librarianship that year. The chosen winner receives $5,000 and a citation.

Dirt is unclean matter, especially when in contact with a person's clothes, skin or possessions. In such case they are said to become dirty. Common types of dirt include: * Dust: a general powder of organic or mineral matter * Filth: foul matter such as excrement * Grime: a black, ingrained dust such as soot * Soil: the mix of clay, sand, and humus which lies on top of bedrock Exhibitions and studies A season of artworks and exhibits on the theme of dirt was sponsored by the Wellcome Trust in 2011. The centrepiece was an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection showing pictures and histories of notable dirt such as the great dust heaps at Euston and King's Cross in the 19th century and the Fresh Kills landfill which was once the world's largest landfill. Cleaning When things are dirty they are usually cleaned with solutions like hard surface cleaner and other chemicals solutions; much domestic activity is for this purpose ‚Äî washing, sweeping and so forth. In a commercial setting, a dirty appearance gives a bad impression. An example of such a place is a restaurant. The dirt in such cases may be classified as temporary, permanent, and deliberate. Temporary dirt is streaks and detritus that may be removed by ordinary daily cleaning. Permanent dirt is ingrained stains or physical damage to an object, which require major renovation to remove. Deliberate dirt is that which results from design decisions such as decor in dirty orange or grunge styling. Disposal As cities developed, arrangements were made for the disposal of trash through the use of waste management services. In the United Kingdom, the Public Health Act 1875 required households to place their refuse into a container which could be moved so that it could be carted away. This was the first legal creation of the dustbin. Health Modern society is now thought to be more hygienic. Lack of contact with microorganisms in dirt when growing up is hypothesised to be the cause of the epidemic of allergies such as asthma. The human immune system requires activation and exercise in order to function properly and exposure to dirt may achieve this. For example, the presence of staphylococcus bacteria on the surface of the skin regulates the inflammation which results from injury. Even when no visible dirt is present, contamination by microorganisms, especially pathogens, can still cause an object or location to be considered dirty. For example, computer keyboards are especially dirty as they contain on average 70 times more microbes than a lavatory seat. People and animals may eat dirt. This is thought to be caused by mineral deficiency and so the condition is commonly seen in pregnant women. Neurosis People may become obsessed by dirt and engage in fantasies and compulsive behaviour about it, such as making and consuming mud pies and pastries. The source of such thinking may be genetic, as the emotion of disgust is common and the location for this activity in the brain has been proposed.

He is a Distinguished Professor of Ecology & Evolution, University of California, Irvine, and was previously a Distinguished Professor of Genetics at the University of Georgia. Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he received his B.S. in 1970 in Natural Resources from the University of Michigan; his M.A.in 1971 in Zoology from the University of Texas at Austin; and his Ph.D. in 1975 in Genetics from the University of California, Davis. Avise's research entails the use of molecular markers to analyze ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary processes in nature. It covers a broad spectrum of topics: genetic parentage, reproductive modes, population structure, speciation, hybridization, introgression, phylogeography, systematics, and phylogenetics. He has conducted research on diverse animal taxa ranging from corals and sponges to representatives of all the major vertebrate groups. Research and Scientific Contributions In 1972, Avise published the first multi-locus allozyme analysis in any fish species, and uncovered a profound effect of genetic drift in nature. During the 1970s and 1980s, his protein-electophoretic work on many fishes, mammals, and birds demonstrated that natural populations are genetically highly polymorphic and that molecular markers can be utilized to address many natural-history topics that previously had been analyzed solely from phenotypic data. He thereby helped to pioneer the fields of molecular ecology and molecular evolution. In 1994, he published Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution, a comprehensive textbook on the application of genetic markers in ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary contexts. In the late 1970s, he was among the first to introduce mitochondrial (mt) DNA to population biology. This seminal work laid the foundation for phylogeography, a field for which he is recognized as the founding father. Among the many phylogeographic applications for which his laboratory paved the way were genetic assessments of marine and freshwater turtles, catadromous eels, unisexual fishes, and regional assemblages of birds, fishes, mammals, herps, and marine invertebrates. In the 1990s, Avise capitalized upon highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to analyze animal mating systems in nature, on creatures ranging from sea spiders and snails to polyembryonic armadillos to numerous fishes, including male-pregnant pipefishes and seahorses, and hermaphroditic killifishes. This line of inquiry eventuated in many articles plus a trilogy of books dealing with evolutionary perspectives on clonality (2008), hermaphroditism (2011), and pregnancy (2013). In addition to research in molecular ecology and evolution, Avise has published on the relevance of evolutionary genetics to human affairs ranging from religious beliefs, to the human genome, to genetically modified organisms, to the history and philosophy of science. In 2006, Avise joined with Francisco Ayala to inaugurate a series of annual Sachler Colloquia, sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, entitled \\"In the Light of Evolution\\" (ILE). Each ILE installment highlights a topic that can be informed by evolutionary thought and has broader societal relevance. Proceedings of ten ILE colloquia were published in PNAS, and most also appeared as edited books from the National Academies Press.

In doing this he had the support of General Ayub Khan who provided troops to control communications with London so as to avoid any possibility of the Queen being advised to replace the Governor-General. The failure of the courts to support representative institutions in Federation of Pakistan v. Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan provided a pattern which latter led to more open military intervention against elected governments to be justified using a doctrine of necessity.Pakistan - Constitutional Beginnings, Country Data 1958 coup In 1958, the first Pakistani President Major General Iskander Mirza dismissed the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan and the government of Prime Minister Feroz Khan Noon, appointing army commander-in-chief Gen. Ayub Khan as the Chief martial law administrator. Thirteen days later, Mirza himself was exiled by Ayub Khan, who appointed himself president. 1977 coup (Operation Fair Play) Operation Fair Play was the code name for the coup d'etat conducted at midnight on July 4, 1977 by the Pakistan military, led by Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul- Haq, against the government of then-Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. General Zia ordered the arrest of Bhutto, his ministers and other leaders of both the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan National Alliance. In a nationally televised address, General Zia announced that the National Assembly of Pakistan and all provincial assemblies were dissolved, and that the Constitution of Pakistan was suspended. The martial law enforced by President General Zia, it introduced the strict but modern form of conservatism which promoted the nationalistic and religious programmes. 1999 coup In October, 1999 senior officers loyal to army chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf arrested prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his ministers after thwarting the Sharif regime's attempt to dismiss Musharraf and prevent his plane from landing in Pakistan as he returned from a visit to Sri Lanka. Indirect intervention The death of Zia-ul-Haq led to the appointment of Ghulam Ishaq Khan as President. Khan had vast, unchecked Presidential powers and was known to be close to the Pakistani military. Khan had dismissed both Benazir Bhutto in 1990 and Nawaz Sharif as Prime Minister in 1993, though the latter resulted in his own resignation and is known in Pakistan as the Waheed Kakar formula. Unsuccessful coup attempts There have been numerous unsuccessful coup attempts in Pakistani history. The first noted attempt was the Rawalpindi conspiracy in 1951 led by Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan along with left-wing activists and sympathetic officers against the government of Liaquat Ali Khan, Pakistan's first prime minister. Prominent poet-intellectual Faiz Ahmed Faiz was suspected of involvement. In 1980, a plot by Maj. Gen. Tajammul Hussain Malik to assassinate Zia-ul-Haq on Pakistan Day on March 23, 1980 was exposed and thwarted. In 1995, a coup attempt against the government of Benazir Bhutto led by Maj. Gen. Zahirul Islam Abbasi with the support of Islamic extremists was foiled. An alleged coup attempt planned by Mustafa Khar during his exile during General Zia ul Haq's reign was thwarted beforehand due to Seth Abid playing double agent and informing the military about the plot. Allegedly, some disgruntled army officers were provided details of a safe house where weapons procured from India directly by Mustafa Khar after negotiating with an Indian agent in their London High Commission.

The prologue and epilogue were written by Leonard Welsted.

Plot The preface to the play, written by Leonard Welsted, asserts that the play is departing from popular comedies of the day and impresses upon the audience the primacy of morality and manners over lewd jokes and licentious behavior. In the play, Sir John Bevil is encouraging his son, Bevil Jr., to marry the wealthy Lucinda, daughter of Mr. Sealand. John Bevil was quite the rake in his day, and he is trying to encourage his son to settle down with a wife and start a family. Bevil Jr., however, is faced with a dilemma, for though he is set to marry Lucinda, he is not in love with her, but his good friend Myrtle is. Bevil Jr. is in love with Indiana, a poor woman whose mother died when Indiana was seven. Indiana has been raised by her Aunt Isabella (Mr. Sealand's sister). She is the daughter of Mr. Sealand by his first wife, though no one realizes it. Mr. Sealand is intent on marrying his daughter Lucinda to Bevil Jr., but Mrs. Sealand, Mr. Sealand's second wife and Lucinda's mother, is intent on her marrying the young coxcomb Cimberton, because of his vast fortune and also because he is Mrs. Sealand's cousin. However, because of his fortune, Cimberton cannot marry without the consent of his Uncle Geoffrey or his counsel of lawyers. So Bevil Jr. and Myrtle devise a scheme where Myrtle and Bevil Jr.'s servant, Tom, will disguise themselves as Sir Geoffrey's lawyers, Bramble and Target, in order to delay the wedding proceedings. They arrive at Mr. Sealand's house in disguise, and convince Cimberton and Mrs. Sealand that the marriage absolutely cannot proceed without Sir Geoffrey's physical presence to sign away part of the estate. In the meantime, Sir John and Mr. Sealand discuss Bevil Jr.'s morals, for it has been discovered that he has been visiting a woman of lower class on a frequent basis. Mr. Sealand decides to go and visit this young woman so that he may judge Bevil Jr.'s moral conduct for himself, and Sir John and his servant Humphrey discuss the implication of marrying his son off as a bargaining chip to double the estate rather than letting Bevil Jr. choose a wife of his own. The next day, Phillis, Lucinda's maid, arrives at Bevil Jr.'s lodgings with news that Sir Geoffrey is expected in town at any moment, and suggests that Myrtle disguise himself as Sir Geoffrey in order to further delay the marriage proceedings. Myrtle arrives at Mr. Sealand's house disguised at Sir Geoffrey. Mrs. Sealand is in a hurry to marry Lucinda to Cimberton while her husband is away, she begins proceedings for a wedding. When Mr. Sealand arrives at Isabella and Indiana's lodgings, Isabella recognizes him, but he does not recognize her. He talks to Indiana, listens to her sad story, and while she is in a crying fit she drops a bracelet on the floor, and Mr. Sealand recognizes it as the bracelet he gave his first wife just before they were separated. Mr. Sealand is happy to be reunited with his daughter and sister, and in this moment insists that Indiana marry Bevil Jr. Isabella leaves that instant to get Bevil Jr. and arrives with Sir John Bevil, Bevil Jr., Mrs. Sealand, Cimberton, Myrtle disguised as Sir Geoffrey, and Lucinda. In this final scene, Mr. Sealand says he would rather have Myrtle marry Lucinda because he never likes Cimberton, and Cimberton will not marry Lucinda because her dowry has just been halved by the discovery of the other daughter. He leaves, and Myrtle reveals himself. In the end, the moral of the story, given by Sir John, is that the happiness of the young is provided by good virtue, honesty and \\"Providence.\\" Roman origins Sir Richard Steele considered himself an innovator and an educator in 18th-century England, working to replace the lewd comedies of the Restoration era with a new type of drama that would be more effective in providing moral education for the public.1\\\\. Hynes, Peter. \\"Richard Steele and the Genealogy of Sentimental Drama: A Reading of The Conscious Lovers.\\" Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature 40.2 (2004): 142-66 Steele's innovation in this play comes from strategically implemented changes to the traditional Greek and Roman theories of comedy. The Conscious Lovers is a very loose adaptation of Terence's Andria, or The Woman of Andros, itself a translation of an older Greek play.2\\\\. Horejsi, Nicole. \\"(Re)Valuing the 'Foreign Trinket': Sentimentalizing the Language of Economics in Steele's Conscious Lovers.\\" Restoration and 18th Century Theatre Research 18.2 (2003): 11-36[2] Many other 18th-century playwrights created adaptations of ancient Roman plays, particularly favoring the works of Plautus and Terence.[2] Steele knew that his audience would be familiar with the Roman source, as Terence's plays were in heavy circulation during this time, being published in hundreds of editions between 1700 and 1800.[5] These adaptations were an attempt among playwrights to lend a type of legitimacy and authority to the contemporary theater by drawing from a body of familiar classical stories.[2] Steele was also aware that comparisons would be made between his adaptation and the original.[5] The seriousness of Terence was noted by many contemporaries to be one important element of traditional tragedy that Steele incorporated into his revised version of comedy, known today as sentimental comedy. Steele considered Terence's serious tone, and the different effect it produces on the viewing audience from the more light-hearted comedy of the era, to be an essential component in the function of his new dramatic form as a ‚Äúradical correction to the libidinous exuberance of Restoration comedy‚Äù.[5] Some critics have suggested that deeper parallels to the Romans are deliberately constructed into the play. Rather than simply adopting the emotional tone of classical works, it has been argued that Steele idealizes the Roman empire as a model for the developing British empire. In this reading, the goal of his new dramatic style is for the audience to throw off the barbarous traditions of the past, both theatrical and political, and become more like the civilized Romans.[2] By drawing from the classical dramatic tradition and refining its models, Steele hoped that he could refine British culture in the same way that his journalistic publications provided readers with moral guidance.[2] The Conscious Lovers builds on the history of drama while attempting to eschew contemporary principles of morality and theatricality to create new sets of values.[1] The innovation of sentimental comedy The new values of Steele's ‚Äúsentimental comedy‚Äù are expressed in The Conscious Lovers by two significant innovations to Restoration drama. One of these transitions is a new conception of social morality that values restrained passion and patient reflection over bold, contentious behavior. The play marks an attempt by Steele to distinctly separate his work from the moral baseness of the comedies that preceded it. He claimed in the preface that the whole play was written around the scene in act 4 where Bevil Junior overcomes his passions and thus avoids a duel with his friend Myrtle. The ethics of dueling was an issue of debate in the public sphere during this time, including other publications by Steele himself. However, critics analyzing the history and development of sentimental comedy have found Steele's self-professed key scene to be about more than disapproval of the evil and waste of human life that results from dueling. Steele's assertion in the preface suggests that the play's purpose is not only to move the audience by depicting scenes of emotional distress[3], but also to provide a guideline for a more restrained and refined behavior in the emerging English middle class.[5] The play argues that the greatest rewards are reaped by those who maintain the virtue of patience.[1] Bevil Junior and his indifferent restraint represent an ideal of peaceable behavior in sharp contrast to the British theatrical norm of aggressive masculinity and assertiveness.[1] The Conscious Lovers offers a new system of morals, one that can guide the nation into the future and protect its integrity under the weight of the growing empire.[2] In another major transition, the classical theory of comedy is altered by making the protagonist a positive, exemplary hero rather than a negative example of how not to behave. Steele also claimed in the preface to The Conscious Lovers that the play had a particular and deliberate purpose to be an ‚ÄúExample and Precept‚Äù to the audience.[2] By providing paragons of upstanding and righteous character, Steele wanted sentimental comedy to be a source of role models that the public could embrace and emulate. As the ridiculousness of comedic protagonists is stripped away, so is much of the lightheartedness and wit of Restoration comedies. The Conscious Lovers, while not devoid of laughter, replaces laughter with a serious attitude and a new set of comedic values. The fops and the rakes of the previous era are made relics, costumes that are to be ridiculed in public, as is Bevil's father when he attends the masquerade. Formally, the new sentimental comedy ‚Äútends to the monumental, both in plot details and dialogue.‚Äù[1] Characters speak in ‚Äúsentiments‚Äù, or pithy moral statements of high theatricality that bear greater resemblance to tragedy than to the older comedies. These sentiments were easily quotable, widely circulated and often republished in collections. The ideal of reform and social critique in The Conscious Lovers functions similarly to Steele's work in periodicals like the Spectator, the Tatler, and the Guardian. Steele was able to compound the moral authority he commanded from adapting a traditional Roman play with the recognition he already possessed as a cultural critic from these journalistic works in order to establish this new type of drama.[2] Analysis The dynamic triangle of parents and children in The Conscious Lovers highlights a temporary shift in English polite society from marriage contracts executed as business deals to marriage as an act of love between two people, with limited input from the parents. In his book The Family, Sex, and Marriage in England, 1500-1800Lawrence Stone, ‚ÄúThe Companionate Marriage‚Äù in The Family, Sex, and Marriage in England, 1500-1800 (New York: Harper and Row, 1977). Lawrence Stone says that the enhanced dowries which accompanied brides leading into the mid-18th century put the wife in more of a position of power than she had ever had before. And as more marriages deteriorated because of a lack of affection between the husband and wife, many younger people coming of age in mid-18th century England started seeing marriage as a contract between friends where both partners were equals, rather than a business contract which ultimately left the wife as little more than the husband's personal servant. Steele's The Conscious Lovers also hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a duel. These plays set up a new set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and ennoble it. Contemporary reception The Conscious Lovers received a mixed reception during its initial run. It was extremely popular after its debut, and was highly anticipated even before its first performance.[2] The play ran for eighteen consecutive nights, and received many revivals during the 18th century.[1] It made more money than any other play performed at Drury Lane up until that time.[1] The public largely did respond to the play in the way that Steele had intended.[1] However, despite Steele's claims about the importance of the scene where the duel is averted by Bevil's moment of composed reflection, critics disagree about whether or not audiences received this scene in the way that Steele intended. Some have agreed that Steele's comments in the preface are instructive and that the duel in act 4 provides the centerpiece of the action.[4] Others have suggested that the play is constructed to build up dramatic tension to the final discovery scene.[2] Many readers have found the end of the play to be the pivotal point of the drama rather than the narrowly averted duel. In fact, 18th-century audiences reacted much more strongly to Indiana's reuniting with her long-lost father than any other part of the plot.[2] This was the moment that consistently evoked strong sentimental emotions, even among Steele's contemporary critics.[2] One of those critics, John Dennis, was widely known for his dislike of Steele and the Drury Lane theater. Dennis wrote a scathing review of The Conscious Lovers the week before its debut performance, but the critique had little effect on the play's popularity.[2] He strongly disapproved of what he perceived to be Steele's attempt to market bad entertainment as a commercial enterprise.[1][6] Dennis especially regarded Steele's departure from the traditions of comedic theater as distasteful. He considered the British comedy to be the greatest in all the theaters of Europe, in terms of both moral education and entertainment.[6] To him and other critics of his time, The Conscious Lovers did not even feel like a comedy.[5] Steele's innovations in sentimental comedy were intended to incorporate elements of tragedy, but for Dennis, the play was too ‚Äútragical‚Äù.[5][6] Mixing emotional responses by evoking sadness at the end of the play was considered a violation of the principle that comedy and tragedy were supposed to be separate entities, each consistent in tone and in the feelings they produced in the audience.[1] Satire was another element Dennis felt was lacking in The Conscious Lovers new brand of comedy. Satire was the traditional method by which British comedy was expected to produce moral reflection in the audience. With the exception of Cimberton, Steele's characters were not ignoble enough to function as instructive objects of satire.[1][6] He could not accept the behavior of the protagonist, who he found to be neither entertaining nor a benchmark for morality.[3][6] Bevil Junior's regularity and upstanding ethics did not allow the accustomed sense of ridicule to develop, and therefore the action of comedy was disrupted. Dennis also considered the characterizations too improbable, and their actions or inactions too unlikely, which detracted from the unity of the structure.[1] In his mind, the sentimental comedy incorporated too much catharsis, while The Conscious Lovers and its followers favored a positive, exemplary hero as a moral beacon. Steele recognized that not everybody in the audience would approve of his changes and the contrivances he employed to deliver them, but also believed that these older definitions were too narrow and excluded sufficient conditions that allowed comedy to be a vehicle of reform.[4] These departures from the comedic tradition marked Steele as an iconoclast in the eyes of his contemporaries, but they also earned him the distinction of an innovator in British drama.[1] ReferencesEditions *Steele, Richard The Conscious Lovers (Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1968) .

His rule in Guria as well as in Imereti were result of coups and part of a chaotic civil war raging in these western Georgian polities. Demetre's royal career in Imereti terminated with his deposition and blinding. Demetre was a member of the Gurieli, a family of princes-regnant of Guria. His parentage is not directly attested in the surviving chronicles and documents; Demetre appears to have been a son of Simon I Gurieli, a patricide, who was deposed and blinded in 1626. Demetre emerged from obscurity in 1658, when he was installed in Guria by King Alexander III of Imereti in place of his relative Kaikhosro I Gurieli, whom the king had deposed and forced into exile in Istanbul. Formerly an Orthodox monk, Demetre recompensed his act of unfrocking by donating the church of the Redeemer in Aketi as a metochion to the patriarchal see of Bichvinta. In 1660, Kaikhosro, with Ottoman support, returned and put Demetre to flight to Imereti. Demetre was able to resume his rule in Guria after having Prince Machutadze murdered Kaikhosro. In the conflict with Kaikhosro, Demetre relied on Vameq III Dadiani, an ambitious prince of Mingrelia and briefly king of Imereti, whom he eventually betrayed and joined King Vakhtang V of Kartli, who intervened in the chaotic civil war in Imereti in 1661. Amid a series of coups and counter-coups, one part of the Imeretian nobles made Demetre king after the abdication of Vakhtang V's son Archil in 1663. His rule proved short- lived: the Imeretians caught, blinded, and expelled him and restored Bagrat V. According to the 18th-century Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti, Demetre's final downfall occurred in 1668. Thereafter he disappeared from history. As prince of Guria, he was succeeded by Giorgi III Gurieli, an exiled son of his erstwhile foe, Kaikhosro Gurieli. Vakhushti's dating is sometimes questioned in modern historiography, notably by Davit Khakhutaishvili, who argued that Demetre's rule in Guria should have ended no later than 1664.

He is best remembered today for serving as the first director/principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre in Prague. Biography Born in Mƒõln√≠k, Ma√Ωr began his career working as an opera singer at the opera house in Klagenfurt in 1839. From 1842‚Äì1844 he worked at various theatres in Prague, after which he was committed to the opera house in Darmstadt from 1844‚Äì1846. At the behest of Franti≈°ek Ladislav Rieger, he returned to Prague in 1846 to become a principal singer at the Estates Theatre. His singing was praised by Czech audiences but his acting was found to be wanting. He was eventually appointed the house's chorus master at the beginning of the 1848‚Äì1849 season. By 1851 Ma√Ωr was no longer appearing in opera roles, but was now working as a conductor of a number of different musical ensembles in Prague; including choirs in various cathedrals in the city (such as the Our Lady of the Snows Basilica). He left his position as chorus master at the Estates Theatre in 1853 to focus on his career as a conductor. He gained a great reputation in Prague for his conducting of sacred music during the 1850s. In 1854 he was appointed as a teacher of singing at the Prague Conservatory. In the autumn of 1862, Ma√Ωr was appointed the first director/principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, to the disappointment of Bed≈ôich Smetana, who had hoped for the position himself.Large, p. 124 The theatre opened on 18 November 1862, with a performance of V√≠tƒõzslav H√°lek's tragic drama King Vakusin.Large, pp. 124‚Äì25 Since there was at the time no Czech opera deemed suitable, the first opera performed at the theatre, on 20 November 1862, was Cherubini's Les deux journ√©es. For the first year or so of its life, the Provisional Theatre alternated opera with straight plays on a daily basis, but from the start of 1864 opera performances were given daily. Ma√Ωr remained at the Provisional Theatre until September 1866; his tenure was marked by a professional rivalry with Smetana, who criticised the theatre's conservatism and failure to fulfil its mission to promote Czech opera.Large, p. 136 Ma√Ωr retaliated by refusing to conduct Smetana's The Brandenburgers in Bohemia.Large, p. 144 A change in the theatre's management in 1866 led to Ma√Ωr's removal and replacement by Smetana.Large, p. 167 He continued to be active as a conductor in Prague up until his death in that city in 1888.

The channel is headquartered in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The channel was originally promoted by Sashi Kumar with seed capital provided by Reji Menon in the mid 1990s. In late 2006 Reji Menon partially pulled out of Asianet Communications, turning over control to Rajeev Chandrasekhar (Jupiter Entertainment Ventures). Star India bought a 51% stake in Asianet Communications and formed joint venture with JEV in November, 2008. Star India acquired 100% stake in Asianet Communications in March 2014. History Asianet Communications was the first entertainment television company in Malayalam. It was promoted by Sashi Kumar with seed capital provided by Reji Menon. Kumar was a former head of Press Trust of India's television division and his relative Menon was a Moscow-based businessman. When Asianet faced a financial crunch, the real estate firm Rahejas was given 50% stake in the cable operations. The channels were still owned by Sashi Kumar (50% shares) and Reji Menon (50% shares). The Rahejas later wanted a stake in the channel operations too. While Kumar resisted overtures from the Rahejas, Menon negotiated a deal with them, and under the deal, the Rahejas got full control over the cable company. Menon used the consideration the Rahejas paid him to provide Kumar a \\"golden handshake\\". Afterwards an attempt by Zee Group to acquire Asianet from Menon fell through. This was apparently because the severance agreement with the cable company prohibits the channel's takeover by a company with interest in cable operations. Rajiv Chandrasekhar Era (2006 - 2008)  In late 2006 Reji Menon - after months long speculations - partially pulled out of Asianet turning over control to Rajeev Chandrasekhar. At the time, Asianet was the leader amongst the Malayalam channels accounting for 35% of Kerala's total advertisement market. Chandrasekhar had acquired a 51% stake in the Asianet channels (Asianet, Asianet News, and Asianet Plus) through Jupiter Entertainment Ventures (JEV) in October 2006. While there was no official word from Asianet on the size of the investment, the figure is thought to range between INR 120-150 crore. The remaining 49% stake was still held by Reji Menon and Asianet MD K. Madhavan with Zee Group holding a small 3% stake. Madhavan continued as the MD of Asianet, while Chandrasekhar took over as the Chairman of the company. Asianet Communications soon launched its foray into Kannada and Telugu television industry with Asianet Suvarna and Asianet Sitara. Star India Acquisitions (2008 - 2014)  Asianet was restructured into four companies in June 2008 (general entertainment, news, radio and media infrastructure). This move was to allow separate investments in each company. Star India started talks with the owners of the Asianet channels in August, 2008. Star India eventually bought a 51% stake in Asianet Communications and formed joint venture with JEV in November, 2008. The joint venture, called \\"Star Jupiter\\", comprised all general entertainment channels of Asianet 8 October 2013 bombay 12 March Communications (Asianet, Asianet Plus, Asianet Suvarna and Asianet Sitara) and Star Vijay. Star India had reportedly paid $235 million in cash for the 51% stake and assumed net debt of approximately $20 million. It's not clear how much stake Menon held in the new Star Jupiter venture. Prior to forming the JV, it was known that the original founder had held about 26% stake. Star India increased its stake in Asianet Communications to 75% in July 2010 (for which Star India paid around $90 million in cash), and to 87%, by acquiring 12% stake for $160 million in June, 2013. The later move was by virtue of acquiring a 19% equity stake in Vijay TV from Chandrasekhar and Asianet Communications MD Madhavan. Following the June, 2013 investment, Asianet Communications was valued at $1.33 billion. Star India acquired 100% stake in Asianet Communications (buying the remaining 13% stake) in March 2014. Coverage and viewership Asianet has a presence in over 60 countries worldwide including the Indian sub-continent, China, South East Asia, Middle East, Europe, United States and the lower half of the former Soviet Union. Programming Asianet is a Malayalam GEC channel with programming which appeals to all ages and demography. It has programming which appeals to all audiences irrespective of their age groups or demography. The channel is well accepted as the complete family entertainer with game shows, reality show, comedy, spiritual shows, cookery, talk shows, musical shows, drama, films, and events.

Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Downey, Julia: 1999 Kit Aircraft Directory, Kitplanes, Volume 15, Number 12, December 1998, page 36. Primedia Publications. ISSN 0891-1851Purdy, Don: AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, page 113. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. Development Designer Wilf Stark conceived the Eureka as a US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles compliant aircraft. Stark identified that the US market lacked \\"an affordable Ultralight that is also easy to build\\". Stark further noted: \\"Although there are ultralight kits available for about $4500-$6500 (prior to engine purchase), they often require building and fabrication times that can approach 600 to 1000 hours for first-time builders. This realistically translates into 2 or more years of building time that somehow has to be accommodated among other family obligations. It is a sad statistic that less than one-third of purchased airplane kits ever get completed by the original purchaser. They either quietly wither away in a corner, or they are sold at a fraction of their original price, to be completed by someone else.\\" Another aim of the design was to keep the complete purchase cost under US$6000 as the designer felt that this was the maximum figure that most builders could justify without causing marital discord. As a result, he designed the Eureka to be both inexpensive and quick to construct from an assembly kit. The kit included pre-built wings, tail and fuselage that could be bolted together in about 20 hours of labour for the airframe, giving a total assembly time of two weekends. The aircraft is constructed predominantly from foam, aluminum and wood with no aircraft fabric used in finishing. Each wing uses a deep spar, foam ribs and is covered in a single pre-painted white aluminum panel. The controls are conventional three-axis, with full-span ailerons and an all- flying rudder. The wings are not folding, but can be removed in five minutes to allow trailering the aircraft. To keep costs and aircraft weight down, the recommended engines are the Hirth F-33 engine and the Zenoah G-25 of . The prototype Eureka first flew in August 1997. In 1999, reviewer Andre Cliche said: \\"The kit sells for $6000, which is amazingly low when you consider that this number even includes the engine, propeller and basic instruments. I wonder if they will stay in business for long with such a low profit margin?\\" After introduction, the price was increased to US$5000 for the airframe alone, estimating that it could be completed for US$8000 total. The company ceased providing kits in July 2003 stating \\"The Eureka has been withdrawn from the market due to lack of resources.\\" Specifications (Eureka) See alsoReferencesExternal links * *Photo of Ameri-Cana Eureka Category:1990s Canadian ultralight aircraft ","title":"Ameri-Cana Eureka"},{"id":"24494541","text":"French Postcards is a 1979 romantic-comedy film starring Miles Chapin, Blanche Baker, David Marshall Grant, Val√©rie Quennessen, Debra Winger, Mandy Patinkin, Marie-France Pisier and Jean Rochefort about a group of American exchange students who spend a year studying in Paris.

Biography He is considered one of the most important Frisian landscape painters of the Dutch Golden Age. His landscapes were either idealized in the Italian manner or more naturalistic and depicting recognizable features of his native Friesland region. The Italianate landscapes seem to be influenced by the work of Salvator Rosa, but also by Haarlem painters such as Jan van Goyen and Salomon van Ruysdael. Mancadan also served as a government official, and apparently did not begin painting until midway through his life. According to the RKD he lived in Franeker from 1634 to 1644, where he also served as mayor. In 1658 he became involved in peatwinning in the southeast of Friesland and was one of initiators of the canal, dug to Bakkeveen. He settled down in Siegerswoude. After his wife died he moved to Beetsterzwaag where his daughter lived. He died in Tjerkgaast, where his son, who had a bad reputation, was a minister.

Jones also championed Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking.Raising Steaks, Christine Muhlke, NY Times September 24, 2009 She retired as senior editor and vice president at Alfred A. Knopf in 2011. Jones was also a cookbook author and memoirist. She won multiple lifetime achievement awards, including the James Beard Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. Career= Editor  Jones joined Knopf in 1957 as an assistant to Blanche Knopf and editor working mainly on translations of French writers such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. Before that she worked for Doubleday, first in New York City and then in Paris, where she read and recommended The Diary of Anne Frank, pulling it out of the rejection pile. Jones recalled that she came across Frank's work in a slush pile of material that had been rejected by other publishers; she was struck by a photograph of the girl on the cover of an advance copy of the French edition. \\"I read it all day,\\" she noted. \\"When my boss returned, I told him, 'We have to publish this book.' He said, 'What? That book by that kid?'\\" She brought the diary to the attention of Doubleday's New York office. \\"I made the book quite important because I was so taken with it, and I felt it would have a real market in America. It‚Äôs one of those seminal books that will never be forgotten,\\" Jones said. Jones's relationship with Julia Child similarly began when Jones became interested in Child's manuscript Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which had been rejected by a publishing house. After her years in Paris, Jones had moved to New York, where she was frustrated with the ingredients and recipes commonly available in the U.S. Jones said of the book Mastering the Art of French Cooking, \\"This was the book I had been searching for,\\" and she got it published. In America's postwar years, home cooking was dominated by packaged and frozen food, with an emphasis on ease and speed. After the success of Child's cookbook, Jones continued to expand the resource options for American home cooks. \\"I got so excited by Julia's book and what it did for making people better cooks, and the tools that you needed to make it really work in an American city or small town, and I thought, If we could do this for French food, for heavens' sake, let's start doing it for other exotic cuisines!\\" Jones recalled. \\"I used the word \\"exotic,\\" and that meant the Middle East with Claudia Roden, it meant better Indian cooking with Madhur Jaffrey.\\" After working with Edna Lewis on The Taste of Country Cooking, Jones focused more on American regional cooking. Major culinary authors Jones brought into print include Julia Child, Lidia Bastianich, James Beard, Marion Cunningham, Rosie Daley, Edward Giobbi, Marcella Hazan, Madhur Jaffrey, Irene Kuo, Edna Lewis, Joan Nathan, Scott Peacock, Jacques P√©pin, Claudia Roden, and Nina Simonds. The 18-book Knopf Cooks American series was Jones' creation. Jones was also the longtime editor of noted authors John Updike, Anne Tyler, John Hersey, Elizabeth Bowen, Peter Taylor, and William Maxwell.\\"An Editing Life, a Book of Her Own\\" , Julia Moskin, NY Times, October 24, 2007 Other major authors whom Jones edited include Langston Hughes, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Author Jones wrote three books with her husband Evan, and wrote three on her own since his death: one on cooking for one person; a memoir of her life and food; and a cookbook for food that can be shared with dogs. Jones contributed to Vogue, Saveur, Bon App√©tit, Departures, and Gourmet magazines. In 2006, she was awarded the James Beard Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award. She was portrayed by American actress Erin Dilly in the 2009 film, Julie & Julia. ‚ÄúLearning to like cooking alone is an ongoing process. But the alternative is worse.‚ÄùMoskin, 2007 \\"For a long time, the women ‚Äî and they were usually women ‚Äî who wrote about food were treated as second-class citizens. All because they cook! I think that's opened up. A good writer gets some good assignments, and they're treated better somehow. It just takes time.\\"  Life and death  Jones lived in Paris after college, where she met her husband and collaborator, Evan Jones (died 1996). The couple had four children, including two from Evans's previous marriage. Jones died age 93 on August 2, 2017, in Walden, Vermont.

It was built in the early 1850s and consists of a 3-story main block and 2-story addition in the Italianate villa style. In 1882, the property was acquired by New York State for use as an agricultural experiment station, and was part of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station until 1968. It was deeded to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in 1970 for use as a museum. See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History Wealthy agriculturists Nehemiah (also known as William) and Louisa (also known as Louise) Denton moved from New York City to Geneva in 1852, at a time when the area was the center of agricultural prosperity in New York. They purchased the land then known as the Old Castle Farm in the early 1850s, commissioned the building of the Italiante villa now known as Parrott Hall, and moved into the new mansion in 1856. Both Nehemiah and Louisa were deaf mutes. In 1882, Nehemiah was considered to be of \\"unsound mind\\" and, in order to settle his debts, he sold the dwelling, outbuildings, and 125 acres. The property was purchased for $25,000 by the State of New York to become an agricultural experiment station. The villa, then known as Denton Place or Denton House, was converted into the headquarters of what would become the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station at Geneva, colloquially known as the Geneva Experiment Station. In the early 1900s, the building housed the laboratory and offices of the Station's first entomologist, Percival John Parrott, during which time it became known as Entomology Hall. Parrott was known for his efforts to combat San Jose scale, an introduced insect that was severely damaging fruit crops in the early 20th century. He was appointed the station's director in 1938 and served until 1942, the year he retired. The building was renamed Parrott Hall in his honor. Parrott Hall was used by the State from 1882 until 1968, when it was replaced by Barton Hall. To bring recognition to its historic significance, members of the Geneva Historic Society led an effort to nominate it to the National Register of Historic Places. in 1970. It was listed the following year. In recognition of its historic significance, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) took title to the property with the intent to rehabilitate it for use as a museum. Repairs and maintenance were performed by OPRHP from the time the building was vacated by the Station in 1968 until 1983, after which time no substantial maintenance was undertaken. It has been vacant since 1968. Local preservation advocates formed the non-profit Friends of Parrott Hall in 2017. In the summer of 2018, OPRHP solicited bids for demolition. Spurred by the building's imminent demise, the Friends of Parrott Hall formed a coalition with The Landmark Society of Western New York, the Preservation League of New York State, and the City of Geneva to save the building from imminent demolition. Due in part to the coalition's efforts, OPRHP determined that demolition would be \\"delayed indefinitely\\", with the caveat that the coalition raise funds to stabilize the building and provide a plan for its reuse. As of the winter of 2018, the coalition was working with OPRHP to raise funds for stabilization and to formulate a plan for its reuse. The Geneva Experiment Station has made important contributions to the history of botany in New York State, including pioneering advances in carpology, agriculture, horticulture, plant pathology, and dairy production. Studies conducted at the Station aided the development of nurseries in nearby Ontario and Monroe counties and in vineyards across New York State. Structure The structure is an Italianate villa consisting of a three-story hipped roof main block and two story gable roof wing addition to the rear. Its design is based on a plan from the Model Architect, a pattern book written by architect Samuel Sloan in 1853. The Denton's followed Sloan's design closely, making only minor modifications to the front entrance and the belvedere, which has since been removed. In addition to removing the belvedere, the Station made many other interior modifications to suit changing needs. The Hall has an L-shaped layout, with the rear wing extending south from the central block. The main block has a center hall plan. Though there were originally four chimneys, the current building has only three -- two on the east facade of the central block, one on the west wall. Window cornices and sills are of cast iron. The structure has an ornate veranda, consisting of cast iron columns, railing, and parapet extending around the perimeter, except for one section at the southeast corner. The nomination to the National Register of Historic Places notes that Parrott Hall is \\"an outstanding example of the Italianate villa style popular in the mid-nineteenth century. The ornate cast-iron veranda is especially notable.\\" At the time of the NRHP nomination in 1970, the building was covered with the historic standing seam metal roof. In the mid-1970s, the State removed the standing seam metal roof from the main block and replaced it with rolled roofing, rebuilt the three remaining chimneys, and sandblasted and painted the wrought-iron railing, frieze of the verandah, and columns. The building exterior was repainted in 1983. In the early 1980s, Parrott Hall was the focus of a master's thesis by a Cornell graduate student which concluded that the structural condition was \\"impressive, given the age of the building and its many years of heavy use\\" and that the structure had not suffered \\"too badly\\" in the years since 1971, when it was disconnected from steam and electricity. However, the report noted that there were telltale signs of moisture-related problems including periodic basement ponding and damage to the verandah due to the lack of gutters. In the late 1990s, a thesis report by a graduate student in the Historic Preservation Program at the University of Vermont determined that the interior had recently suffered damage due to water infiltration. The report was published to \\"assist the Station with its efforts to stabilize Parrott Hall until such time as money is available for restoration.\\" It was determined that the water damage was due to the roof's deteriorated state, and that roofing, gutters, and downspouts needed to be installed or replaced.

It was written by Motown Records' President and founder Berry Gordy and Miracles member William \\"Smokey\\" Robinson. While not charting nationally, this song was a very popular regional hit tune in many areas of the country, so much so, in fact, that it was included on the group's first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits from the Beginning, and Smokey still sings it, by request, in his live shows today. A slow, intimate ballad number, with relatively sparse orchestration compared to much of their later work, \\"Depend On Me\\" starts with the singular guitar of Miracles member Marv Tarplin. Recorded in the popular Doo-Wop style, Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, as the song's narrator, then takes it from there, singing to the woman he loves, promising her eternal devotion: *If you....need a love like mine that you can depend on... *When your whole world's closing in...and you need a friend... *You can depend... *On me .

He served as director of libraries at Ohio State University from 1971 to 1976 and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1976 to 1986. In 1999, American Libraries named him one of the 20th century's 100 most important leaders in librarianship.100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century (1999). American Libraries, 30(11), 39. Biography Hugh Atkinson was born in Chicago. He worked from 1951 to 1956 as a junior accountant for Lawrence Scudder and Co. while studying accounting at St. Benedict's College. Upon receiving his accounting degree, Atkinson studied English at the University of Chicago, and then received his Masters in Library Science from the University of Chicago Graduate Library School while working in the University Library as a rare books assistant.Remembering Hugh C. Atkinson (1934-1986) (1997). College & Research Libraries News, 58(1), 38. Atkinson's professional library career began at Pennsylvania Military College, where he worked from 1958 to 1961 as a reader services librarian. From 1961 to 1967 he held several positions at the State University of New York at Buffalo library, as head of reference, assistant director for technical services, and as acting assistant director of the Health Sciences Libraries. Here, he oversaw the huge growth of the university library as the State University of New York system rapidly expanded.Alley, B. (1985). A conversation with Hugh Atkinson. Technicalities, 5 (April 1985), 3. In 1967, Atkinson moved to Ohio State University where he served as head of public services (1967‚Äì71), and then as director of libraries (1971‚Äì76). Here he played a seminal role in the creation of one of the first online library circulation systems, the Library Circulation System. The system was later known as the Library Computer System,Bregman, A., & Burger, R. H. (2002). Library automation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1965-2000. IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 24(2), 71-85. but is most commonly referred to by the acronym LCS. The system was notable for its decentralized organization, allowing library users in any given branch of the library to view what was available in any other branch. In an interview with Technicalities in 1985, Atkinson stated, \\"The only way I can see in a decentralized world to maximize library use is to provide, at the varying sites, the ability to borrow freely throughout the campus.\\"Alley, B. (1985). A conversation with Hugh Atkinson. Technicalities, 5 (April 1985), 4. This vision of automated cooperation between decentralized libraries was a key manifestation of Atkinson's overall approach to librarianship, which he termed holistic librarianship. At the heart of this approach was a strong belief in \\"the ideal of cooperation.\\"Gorman, M. (1987). A librarian's librarian: Hugh Craig Atkinson, 1933-1986. Technical Services Quarterly, 4, 2. Having successfully implemented LCS at Ohio State University, Atkinson spent the last 10 years of his life as university librarian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Here he envisioned and oversaw the creation of the Illinois LCS network, a multi- type library network which connected the circulation information not only of the University of Illinois libraries, but also included many state library systems as well. At the time of his death it was the most developed statewide library system in existence.Gorman, M. (1986). Hugh Craig Atkinson, 1933-1986; \\"He has out-soared the shadow of our night,\\" (obituary). American Libraries, 17, 816. This multi-type library network was founded on Atkinson's realization that larger libraries do not simply own all the books smaller libraries have and more, but that smaller libraries often have their own unique collections that larger libraries would also benefit from having access to. His goal was to have the diverse composition of the network supplement each library in ways that were beneficial to its own users‚Äô needs.Atkinson, H. (1987). Atkinson on networks. American Libraries, 18, 434. He wrote, \\"My point is that one should not try to reach some kind of theoretical balance or fairness, but to build a network that will provide, by its services and arrangement, the library activities that will satisfy each of the participants, although not necessarily in the same way.\\"Atkinson, H. (1987). Atkinson on networks. American Libraries, 18, 433. The development of this multi-type, online library network was one of Atkinson's crowning achievements as a librarian. In 1981, he told American Libraries that his most important accomplishment was the \\"clarification in my own mind that the future of the library is in decentralized, electronic access.\\"Brandehoff, S. E. (1981). Hugh C. Atkinson: in pursuit of bibliographical happiness for all. American Libraries, 12, 246. In addition to the creation of the Illinois LCS network, Atkinson contributed to the advancement of modern librarianship in a number of other ways during his years as university librarian at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. He oversaw the reorganization of the library's administrative structure \\"in accordance with his ideas on professionalism and public service\\",Gorman, M. (1987). A librarian's librarian: Hugh Craig Atkinson, 1933-1986. Technical Services Quarterly, 4, 4. which has since become the standard for major academic libraries. Another of his advancements during this time was the creation and implementation of one of the first large-scale searchable online catalogs composed of full bibliographic records in which other libraries in the network were able to synch their short-record catalogs to. This catalog was a major innovation not only in its ability to allow users to see more details about a particular book and whether or not it was available in any of the hundreds of interconnected libraries, but to search the records by keyword in a variety of fields including title and subject headings at the same time, which greatly enhanced the usefulness of subject headings.Alley, B. (1985). A conversation with Hugh Atkinson. Technicalities, 5 (April 1985), 4-5. Hugh Atkinson died on October 24, 1986, aged 52.

The main edifice of the Academy was erected in 1836 at the Ludovica Garden, in Budapest's centrally located VIIIth district. The building was designed by Mih√°ly Pollack in the classical style.  Mission  The academy combined the functions of an advanced Military High School level preparatory school, a military academy on the level of United States Military Academy at West Point, and an advanced college to facilitate assignments as junior staff officers to the Austrian Imperial General Staff. The high school provided volunteers of pre-conscription age, between the ages of 14 and 17, the opportunity to join the Royal Hungarian Defense Forces as cadets or junior officers, depending on academic excellence. Ninety students per year were accepted where, 34 students were financed by private foundation grants, 10 students received free tuition provided by the Government, 23 students paid the full annual tuition of 600 Forints, and 23 paid half tuition per annum. The officers training course required four years to complete, and the interdependence of functions fulfilled several needs of the Defense Forces. It provided a well trained officer corps, a training ground for instructional opportunities for officers, and finally, advanced military training to match the academic level of the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt, Austria. The parallel curriculum, and the matched level of quality, between the two schools guaranteed that the majority of officers of the Hungarian Defense forces were selected from the Ludovica Academy. From the beginning of the final school year, some subjects, of both practical and theoretical nature, were taught in German, and qualified graduates received dual commissions as officers in both forces. This was especially important for the combined Hussar Corps, because this arrangement provided for, in a cycle of 2 to 3 years, a fresh assignment of Hungarian-speaking officers to command Hungarian-speaking troops.  History  The academy was established at the 1808 National Assembly session. It was named after Maria Ludovika of Austria- Este the Royal Princess and the third wife of Ferenc I King of Hungary, who contributed Forint for its upkeep from the funds of the Honours list proclaimed at the Coronation. With additional public donations and patriotic contributions like that of Count J√°nos Buttler, who personally contributed Forints, a substantial amount was collected, and the foundation stone was laid by Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary (Hungarian: J√≥zsef n√°dor) in 1831. The government did everything in its power to prevent the Academy's establishment, and the contributed funds were diverted to other projects. The National Assembly of 1832-36 forbade the language of instruction to be in Hungarian, and this policy was re-introduced, and adhered to, after the Revolt of 1848. Its existence, reorganization and regulation was enshrined in the 1872 XVI article of lawIn Hungarian The 1872 XVI article of law concerning the establishment of the Ludovica Academy of the Royal Hungarian Defense Forces to function as the Royal Hungarian Ludovica Military Defense Academy, and it opened its doors on November 21, 1872. Academic accreditation, with the required level of curriculum, was introduced in 1897 during the government of Prime Minister Baron Dezs≈ë B√°nffy. Several well-known military officers served as instructors at the Academy, with General Henrik Werth, who, as of 1926, served as the commanding officer. After World War II, the Communist regime left the Academy building, like the Buda Castle, in their damaged condition. The horse riding school building housed the Alfa cinema, which, in the early 1990s, was completely destroyed by fire.

He later worked in civil aviation and returned to service during the Second World War. Early life and background Travers was born in Kensington, London. In 1910 he joined the family firm of Joseph Travers and Sons Ltd., but left to enlist in the British Army on the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. First World War Travers served in France as a member of the Machine Gun Section of 1st Battalion, Honourable Artillery Company, before entering the Royal Navy in December 1915 as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant to serve in the Royal Naval Air Service. He was confirmed in his rank on 14 December 1915, and received Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 2556 on 23 January 1916. On 27 May 1916, Travers joined No. 1 Wing RNAS, flying reconnaissance missions on the Western Front. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 October 1916 and, after a rest at the end of the year, was assigned to No. 3 (Naval) Squadron in early 1917, flying a Sopwith Pup single-seat fighter. He gained his first victory on 11 March 1917 driving down an Albatros reconnaissance aircraft out of control over Bapaume. Three more enemy aircraft, all Albatros D.III fighters, were driven down on 17 March, 8 and 21 April, and finally on 24 April, Travers, John Malone and Francis Casey shared in the capture of DFW reconnaissance aircraft at Morchies. On 7 May 1917 he was appointed an acting flight commander. Travers' award of the Distinguished Service Cross was gazetted on 22 June 1917, his citation reading: By that time Travers was in a new assignment, based at Dunkirk, flying anti-submarine patrols over the North Sea. He was promoted to flight commander on 30 June 1917. He served as the Commanding Officer of No. 11 (Naval) Squadron RNAS, a bomber squadron, from 11 March to 25 May 1918, during which time (on 1 April 1918) the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and his unit became No. 211 Squadron RAF. On 1 May 1919 he was appointed an acting major, and was transferred to the RAF unemployed list on 24 August 1919. Inter-war career Travers returned to flying in 1926, being commissioned as a probationary flying officer (Class \\"A\\") in the General Duties Branch of the Reserve of Air Force Officers on 22 June, and was confirmed in his rank on 22 December. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 31 July 1928, but relinquished his commission on 22 June 1929, on completion of service. At the same time Travers was employed by the Blackburn Aeroplane and Manufacturing Company as a test pilot and seaplane pilot from 1926 until 1928. Between 1928 and 1933 he was a flying instructor, at the Bristol and Wessex Club, the Cinque Ports Flying Club, and the London Aeroplane Club. He was a pilot in Alan Cobham's National Air Display company in 1934, flying at air shows and exhibitions, then became a commercial pilot in 1935, working for Spartan Air Lines, Imperial Airways and British Airways, up until 1938. Second World War On 5 January 1939 Travers returned to the Royal Air Force Reserve, being commissioned as a flight lieutenant (Class \\"CC\\"). On 1 September 1939, just two days before the declaration of war with Germany, Travers relinquished his commission in the Reserves, entering the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. By 1 January 1941, when he received a mention in despatches, Travers was an acting squadron leader, and was promoted to that rank on 1 December 1941. After the war Travers remained on the Emergency List of the RAFVR, finally relinquishing his commission on 10 February 1954, retaining the rank of squadron leader. Travers died in 1958. Personal life Travers married Hermia Fraser on 6 August 1919 at Ryton, Shropshire. His two brothers also had distinguished flying careers: * James Lindsay Travers (1883‚Äì1924) was an engineer and designer who worked for the Royal Engineers Balloon Factory and Short Brothers before serving in the RNAS during World War I as a test pilot, ending the war as a lieutenant-colonel in the RAF.

The idea for the story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because the events of the French Revolution were concurrent to the writing of the poem and would serve as a parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes. The poem is divided into two-halves with the first describing Joan's quest to meet Charles, the Dauphin of France. Eventually, she is capable of gaining the Dauphin's support and begins to lead the French military. The secondary half describes the French defeat of the British army at Orl√©ans. After many victories, the poem ends with Charles crowned King of France. Joan of Arc serves as a way for Southey to express his views on history and on politics; these include his republican ideals, his claims that political tyranny was a common element in Europe, and his opposition to Christian practices that he thought were superstitious. Later editions of the poem shifted from a promotion of a deistic view of religion to a more traditional view. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the quality of the images and themes of the poem. However, others believed that the poem lacked merit and some believed that the subject matter was inappropriate to the time. Many critics felt that Southey rushed in composing the work and did not devote enough time to it. Background In July 1793, Southey discussed the story of Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc would serve as a good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300 lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Speech 2006 pp. 36, 44 During 1794, Southey began to plan with Coleridge and others about a political system that they would start in America called Pantisocracy. He needed to get money for the project and he contacted Richard Cruttwell on 19 July 1794 to publish Joan of Arc for that end. After notifying Bedford about the plan, Bedford advised Southey to contact William Nicol, a London publisher, to publish the work and raise more money. Southey did find a publisher, Joseph Cottle, to print his poem. A notification for the publication of Joan of Arc was included in a publication of Southey's poems later in 1794, but the edition was stopped from being printed since it lacked the minimum of 50 subscribers to pay for the cost. The poem was finally published by Cottle in 1796 (see 1796 in poetry) after changes to the text including a section added by Coleridge. The second edition would later be printed without Coleridge's lines and they were instead published on their own. For the second edition, Southey revised many lines and added more research to the work. It was printed in May 1798.Speech 2006 pp. 44‚Äì45, 52‚Äì54, 69, 71‚Äì72 Later editions were published in 1806, 1812, and 1837, with the final one further toning down Southey's republican sentiment.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 34 Poem Of the various versions and changes, the 1798 version is the most regular of the editions. The story describes Joan from her first appearance at Vaucouleurs until the Dauphin Charles VII is crowned at Rheims. The rest of the events are described in flashbacks throughout the first half. As the story begins, an 18-year-old Joan travels to Vaucouleurs, home of Robert de Baudricourt, with her uncle Claude. She arrives searching for the Dauphin and meets Charles Dunois as the general tries to raise troops for France's defence. He helps her through Lorraine to Chinon while explaining her background and life's story to the general. She tells of her family, her natural living, and the effects of the soldiers who brought war to France told to her by a French soldier named Conrade. Of these various incidents, the English's massacring French prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt and the starvation of the people of Rouen during a siege are mentioned. They finally arrive at Chinon where they are able to find the French court.Bernhardt- Kabisch 1977 pp. 34‚Äì35 When Joan comes to speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able to see through the ruse and immediately proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 35‚Äì36 Following this, Joan begins to gather troops and she takes her army to the forests around Orleans. While they camp there, a girl named Isabel comes and begins to describe the events surrounding siege of the city. Joan sends a messenger to offer the English peace, but the English decline. The French attack the English and, as soon as they start, a storm starts up and lightning flashes about them. This scares the English and Joan is able to win and enter the city. Soon after, Joan is able to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and the English are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, the English are pushed back to Tourelles. While the English fight their way there, one of the generals, Salisbury, is able to wound Joan. Her companion, Theodore, is able to kill Salisbury in return but he is brought down by the general Talbot. The French soon lay siege to Tourelles and begin a bloody fight to take the fort. During the battle, the French take many captives and the generals wish to execute them. However, Joan intervenes and ensures the safety of the captives' lives.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 36‚Äì38 In sparing the lives, the French are awarded by God with the collapse of a bridge that leads to many of the English soldiers drowning and a quick victory. The English, after losing Tourelles, fall back to the coast to await for reinforcements. Word comes that the Burgundian troops are coming to help the English. Joan meets with the Duke of Burgundy to warn him against a battle before she returns to her men to help bury the dead. Talbot's son comes with reinforcements from England, and the English army attacks the French at Patay. During the battle, Joan is able to kill the son and Conrade is able to kill the father. This causes the English to flee and, in turn, allows the French to retake Rheims. Once Rheims is free, Charles comes and is crowned the King of France. The story ends with Joan telling him to be a good king.Bernhardt- Kabisch 1977 pp. 34‚Äì35 Themes In terms of subject matter, the story of Joan of Arc was not well known outside of a legend. A history dealing with Joan written by Clement L'Averdy was written in 1790 but it was probably unknown to Southey. This would serve as the major historical source of information on her until Jules Quicherat's history published during the mid-19th century. Of non-historical works, Voltaire's La Pucelle was well known but the work attacks Joan. Joan's reputation was polemical, and Joan would later be turned into a French hero with Napoleon's encouragement. Friedrich Schiller would also deal with the legend the same way in Die Jungfrau von Orleans. In terms of works relying on the general idea of a warrior woman, many such figures exited in epics: Virgil and Camilla, Tasso has Clorinda, and Spenser had Britomart. However, such females were not the central figure as a woman was unique to Southey at the time.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 30‚Äì31 The poem's focus on France served as a way for Southey to discuss his feelings about the French Revolution. In particular, Southey was upset that the British were calling men from their farms to serve as a militia during the time. In terms of the French, Southey did not support Robespierre and the others who followed him in France. However, he did support the idea of the French Republic. When he heard of Marie Antoinette's execution in October 1793, Southey told his friend Bedford that he condemned the action although he held to his Republican beliefs. However, he was further upset when word came that Brissot, the Girondin leader, was executed. This caused him to believe that all of the countries were equally bad, except the Republican United States, which he hoped to make his home. In 1794, many of Southey's feelings on Robespierre's involvement in these actions were included in both Joan of Arc and the Fall of Robbespierre, which followed after Robespierre's own execution. However, Southey had by then become very radical and believed that Robespierre was a great man who only helped mankind in his actions.Speech 2006 pp. 37, 46 The poem also contains many of Southey's views on the Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that the church and the Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of these ideas are repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed that the only way to escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.Speech 2006 pp. 63‚Äì64 The figure of Joan of Arc represents both a common person and a child that was free from society's corruption.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 31 Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding of politics and religion began to change, and this is reflected in the changes of Joan of Arc for the second edition. Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having a more traditional form of religion that was provided to her during her youth.Speech 2006 pp. 72‚Äì73 Critical reception Regarding Joan of Arc, William Wordsworth wrote to William Matthews, 21 March 1796, claiming: \\"You were right about Southey, he is certainly a coxcomb, and has proved it completely by the preface to his Joan of Arc, an epic poem which he has just published. This preface is indeed a very conceited performance and the poem though in some passages of first-rate excellence is on the whole of very inferior execution.\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 40 Charles Lamb, in a 10 June 1796 letter to Coleridge, stated, \\"With Joan of Arc I have been delighted, amazed. I had not presumed to expect of any thing of such excellence from Southey. Why the poem is alone sufficient to redeem the character of the age we live in from the imputation of degenerating in Poetry [...] The subject is well chosen. It opens well [...] On the whole, I expect Southey one day to rival Milton.\\"Madden 1972 qtd pp. 45‚Äì46 (A few days later, though, in a June 13, 1796 letter to Coleridge, after reading his opinion of the work, Lamb tempered his praise: \\"Perhaps I had estimated Southey's merits too much by number, weight, and measure.\\") Coleridge, in a 31 December 1796 letter to John Thelwall, admitted, \\"I entirely accord with your opinion of Southey's Joan [...] the poem tho' it frequently reach the sentimental, does not display, the poetical, Sublime. In language at once natural, perspicuous, & dignified, in manly pathos, in soothing & sonnet-like description, and above all, in character, & dramatic dialogue, Southey is unrivalled; but as certainly he does not possess opulence of Imagination, lofty-paced Harmony, or that toil of thinking, which is necessary in order to plan a Whole.\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 49 John Aikin, in a review for the April 1796 Monthly Review, claimed, \\"We were sorry to observe, in the preface to this work, certain facts stated in order to display the extreme rapidity with which it was written. An epic poem in 12 books finished in six weeks, and, on its improved plan in 10 books, almost entirely recomposed during the time of printing! Is it possible that a person of classical education can have so slight an opinion of (perhaps) the most arduous effort of human invention, as to suffer the fervour and confidence of youth to hurry him in such a manner through a design which may fix the reputation of a whole life?\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 41 The review continued: \\"To proceed to the execution of the design: we do not hesitate to declare our opinion that the poetical powers displayed in it are of a very superior kind, and such as, if not wasted in premature and negligent exertions, promise a rich harvest of future excellence. Conceptions more lofty and daring, sentiments more commanding, and language more energetic than some of the best passages in this poem afford, will not easily be found:‚Äînor does scarcely any part of it sink to languor; as the glow of feeling and genius animates the whole.\\"Madden 1972 qtd pp. 41‚Äì42 An anonymous review in the June 1796 Critical Review argued, \\"When the character of the Maid of Orleans, and the part taken by her against the English, are considered, together with the manner in which the history has been treated by other writers, some suspicion may at first arise, that Mr. Southey has chosen a subject scarcely suited to the dignity of epic poetry. His prudence at least may be called in question. How can he expect to interest the English nation in the fortunes of a heroine who was an active champion against his own countrymen, or be hardly enough to felicitate those successes that involved the English in disgrace?\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 43 In regard to the effort put into writing the poem, the review concluded: \\"The poetical powers of Mr. Southey are indisputably very superior, and capable, we doubt not, of producing a poem that will place him in the first class of English poets. He is at present, he tells his readers, engaged in the execution of Madoc [...] We cannot, therefore, help expressing our wish, that he would not put his future poem to so hazardous an experiment as he has this, by assigning himself so little time for its completion.\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 45 Following this was an anonymous review for the 1796 Analytical Review that stated, \\"we learn with astonishment, that Joan of Arc, in its first form, in twelve books, was [...] finished in six weeks [...] We thought it right to mention a fact on which the author, by detailing it in the beginning of his preface, appears to lay some stress; but we wish entirely to forget it in our examination of the poem, and request our readers to do the same. The story, upon which this poem is founded, is one of the most interesting in the history of France, and is, in several respects, happily adapted to epic representation.\\"Madden 1972 qtd p. 47 The review continued: \\"The general result of the impression which the perusal of this poem has made upon our minds is this: that, although the poem has some redundancies, which the chastised taste of maturer years would have struck out; though a manifest incongruity runs through the piece, in ascribing to characters of the fifteenth century the politics and metaphysics of an enlightened philosopher of the eighteenth; and though allegorical personages [...] but ill supply the place of that grand machinery, which produced so powerful an effect in those epic poems, which have obtained the glorious meed of immortality; we, nevertheless, admire, the noble spirit of freedom, which is evidently the poet's inspiring muse\\".Madden 1972 qtd p. 48 NotesReferences * Bernhardt-Kabisch, Ernest.

When World War I began, he was one of many who rushed into military service. He completed basic training, then volunteered for aviation duty. He was sent to pilot's training with Fliegerersatzkompanie 6 in Fischamend.O'Connor 1994, pp. 225-226. In mid-July 1915, the newly trained pilot received his first flying assignment. He reported to Fliegerkompanie 10 on the Russian Front; it was commanded by Hauptmann (Captain) Erich Kahlen. Flik 10 was not a specialized unit; it operated predominantly two-seater aircraft, such as Hansa-Brandenburg C.Is and Knoller-Albatros B.Is. Their flights were for reconnaissance, artillery direction, and aerial photography. Urban's development of his natural abilities as a pilot soon had him acknowledged as the squadron's most skillful flier. On 1 September 1915, Urban was dubbed a \\"Field Pilot\\". On 28 September, he and his observer had gathered military intelligence of great value while flying a reconnaissance mission. When the machine's engine quit north of Klevan, Urban managed to glide back and perform a deadstick landing, joining friendly forces near Torczyn. On 22 December, while flying over Rowno, he suffered another engine stoppage. While still in flight, he climbed forward, unstuck the engine's valve train, and restarted the motor for the trip home. A week later, he received Austrian Pilot Certificate number 306. Urban was awarded his Field Pilot's Badge on 22 February 1916. During March 1916, he was also awarded the Silver Medal for Bravery First Class. On the 26th, he once again pulled off a daring raid on Klewan's railroad depot. He and his aerial observer, Oberleutnant Grunne, bombed the depot after penetrating heavy cloud cover and extensive anti-aircraft fire; on the way home, they spotted a previously unknown Russian airfield. On the morning of 5 May 1916, Urban and Otto J√§ger, his aerial observer, engaged a Russian aircraft with a crew of three. During a prolonged battle of more than 25 minutes, J√§ger fired 300 shots at the Russians before his machine gun jammed. Urban then fired with a carbine while his gunner cleared the jam. J√§ger then reopened fire, and drove the Russian plane down just within its own lines. When friendly infantry verified the downing, Urban had his first aerial victory. On 7 June 1916, Urban and J√§ger scored a second victory together. The two of them cooperated with another Austro-Hungarian aircrew in driving down a pair of Russian Farman biplanes; each Austro-Hungarian crew was credited with a victory. On 2 August, J√§ger and Urban scored again, when the gunner used 100 rounds of ammunition to shoot down a Farman two-seater behind Russian lines; the fatal victory was later confirmed through interrogation of Russian prisoners of war. On 28 August 1916, flying with a new observer, Urban engaged four Russian planes- three Farman two-seaters and a single-seater Nieuport fighter. The efforts to fight them off took the Austro-Hungarians down into range of enemy antiaircraft fire. As the Austro-Hungarians bucked a headwind from the north, their craft was rocked by a near-miss. Shrapnel slashed into Urban's back, knocking him out. Observer Bastyr restarted the engine, then roused Urban. The latter managed to struggle back to base and was sent to hospital. His heroism was rewarded with a personal written commendation. In September, he was awarded his empire's highest honor, the Gold Medal for Bravery. In December 1916, Urban switched to Fliegerkompanie 27. On 22 February 1917, he was granted the rare distinction of being permanently awarded the Field Pilot's Badge. Halfway through October 1917, he was reassigned again, this time to an artillery direction unit that later developed into Fliegerkompanie 66D. He would serve with them until the following Spring. Then he would be posted to a fighter unit, Fliegerkompanie 14. His Ph√∂nix D.I fighter was marked with his initial 'U' in white on a red background band wrapped around the fuselage aft of the cockpit. He used this plane for his final victory; during a general engagement on 19 May 1918, he downed an Italian fighter, probably a Hanriot HD.1. Relieved from combat duty during July 1918, Urban became a test pilot. A session for evaluating new aircraft was scheduled for 9‚Äì13 July at Aspern Airfield near Vienna. On 12 July 1918, while looping at 1500 meters, his new model Ph√∂nix D.I lost its wings. Karl Urban died in the crash. A week later, he was posthumously promoted to Austria-Hungary's highest noncommissioned officer rank, Offiziersstellvertreter (Deputy Officer).

Forming out of a tropical wave on September 1, 1973, Delia gradually strengthened into a tropical storm as it moved north by September 3\\\\. After reaching this strength, the storm turned more westward and further intensified, nearly attaining hurricane status the next day. The storm peaked with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 986 mbar (hPa; 29.11 inHg). Several hours later, Delia made landfall near Freeport, Texas; however, the storm began to execute a counterclockwise loop, causing it to move back over the Gulf of Mexico. On September 5, the storm made another landfall in Freeport before weakening to a depression. The remnants of Delia eventually dissipated early on September 7 over northern Mexico. Due to the erratic movement of the storm along the Texas coastline, significant rainfall fell in areas near the center and in parts of Louisiana. This led to widespread flooding, especially of farmland, that left $6 million in damages. Five people were killed during the storm. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Delia originated from a tropical wave that formed over the central Caribbean Sea in late August 1973. Tracking towards the west-northwest, convective activity increased and the overall structure of the system improved. By August 31, a weak area of low pressure formed over the Gulf of Honduras. This system tracked northward and further organized into a tropical depression just off the southeastern coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula on September 1. Gradually intensifying, the depression became a tropical storm on September 3 as it turned towards the west. In accordance with its upgrade, it was given the name Delia. This upgrade followed a reconnaissance mission into the system that found sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). A complex steering pattern formed later that day, resulting in a more hostile environment for the cyclone. As Delia neared the Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong tropical storm with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and reconnaissance reported winds well in excess of hurricane-force in numerous squalls associated with the storm. The lowest pressure was recorded at 986 mbar (hPa; 29.11 inHg). However, Delia was not classified a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation. Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport, Texas late on September 4\\\\. After executing a counterclockwise loop, the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September 5\\\\. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September 6 before dissipating early the next day over northern Mexico. Preparations and impact 300px On September 3, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued gale warnings and hurricane watches for areas between Lake Charles, Louisiana and the mouth of the Mississippi. Later that day, they were extended westward to Palacios, Texas and eventually, warnings for areas east of Morgan City, Louisiana were canceled. Due to the unexpected loop taken by Delia, gale warnings were extended as far south as Baffin Bay, Texas. By September 6, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings associated with the storm. Around this time, the National Weather Service issued flood warnings, and warned residents about the possibility of tornadoes forming with the weakening tropical cyclone. In Cameron, Louisiana, an estimated 6,000 residents were evacuated with memories of Hurricane Audrey, a storm that killed 575 in the city, still fresh. Due to the erratic track of the storm along the Texas coastline, widespread heavy rains fell in areas near the storm and in Louisiana. Tides up to , in addition to rainfall up to , caused significant flooding in the Galveston-Freeport area. Up to $3 million was reported in damages to homes due to the flooding. In southern Louisiana, numerous areas received more than of rain and most of the state recorded at least . This rainfall led to widespread flooding, particularly in agricultural areas. Damages to crops amounted to $3 million. In addition to the flooding rains produced by Delia, eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm, injuring four people. Five people were killed during Delia, two of which were directly related to the storm. Two of the other deaths resulted from a car crash, triggered by slick roads, with the two occupants of a pickup truck being killed. The fifth death resulted occurred while a man was boarding up his home and suffered a stress-induced heart attack. The outer bands of the storm also produced significant rainfall in Arkansas and Oklahoma, peaking at and respectively.

Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied American intellectual property law to the reverse engineering of computer software. Stemming from the publishing of several Sega Genesis games by video game publisher Accolade, which had disassembled Genesis software in order to publish games without being licensed by Sega, the case involved several overlapping issues, including the scope of copyright, permissible uses for trademarks, and the scope of the fair use doctrine for computer code. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction against Accolade preventing them from publishing any more games for the Genesis and requiring them to recall all the existing Genesis games they had for sale. Accolade appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit on the grounds that their reverse engineering of the Genesis was protected under fair use. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order and ruled that Accolade's use of reverse engineering to publish Genesis titles was protected under fair use, and that its alleged violation of Sega trademarks was the fault of Sega. The case is frequently cited in matters involving reverse engineering and fair use under copyright law. Background In March 1984, Sega Enterprises Ltd. was purchased by its former CEO, David Rosen, along with a group of backers. Hayao Nakayama, one of these backers, was named the new CEO of Sega. Following the crash of the arcade industry, Nakayama decided to focus development efforts on the home console market. During this time, Sega became concerned about software and hardware piracy in Southeast Asia, and particularly in Taiwan. Taiwan was not a signatory of the Berne Convention on copyright, limiting Sega's legal options in that region. However, Taiwan did allow prosecution for trademark infringement. Though Sega had created security systems in their consoles to keep their software from being pirated and to keep unlicensed publishers out, much like its competitor Nintendo, counterfeiters had discovered ways to prevent the Sega trademark from appearing on their games, bypassing the trademark altogether. The third version of the model 1 Genesis, known as the Genesis III, was the model at the center of Sega v. Accolade for its incorporation of the Trademark Security System (TMSS) After the release of the Sega Genesis in 1989, video game publisher Accolade began exploring options to release some of their PC game titles onto the console. At the time, however, Sega had a licensing deal in place for third-party developers that increased the costs to the developer. According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, \\"One pays them between $10 and $15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs, so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher.\\" In addition to this, Sega required that it would be the exclusive publisher of Accolade's games if Accolade were to be licensed, preventing Accolade from releasing its games to other systems. To get around licensing, Accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the Genesis by purchasing a console in order to decompile the executable code of three Genesis games and use it to program their new cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts that prevented playing of unlicensed games. This was done successfully to bring Ishido: The Way of Stones to the Genesis in 1990. In doing so, Accolade had also copied Sega's copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of Sega's licensed Genesis games. The screen displayed by the Trademark Security System (TMSS) As a result of the piracy and unlicensed development issues, Sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the Genesis released in 1990, referred to as the Genesis III. This new variation of the Genesis included code known as the Trademark Security System (TMSS), which, when a game cartridge was inserted into the console, would check for the presence of the string \\"SEGA\\" at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge. If and only if the string was present, the console would run the game, and would briefly display the message: \\"PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD.\\" This system had a twofold effect: it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy, and it forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up, making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed. Accolade learned of this development at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1991, at which Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an Ishido game cartridge. With more games planned for the following year, Accolade successfully identified the TMSS file. They later added this file to the games HardBall!, Star Control, Mike Ditka Power Football, and Turrican. Lawsuit On October 31, 1991, Sega filed suit against Accolade in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on charges of trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act. Copyright infringement, a violation of the Copyright Act of 1976, was added a month later to the list of charges. In response, Accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the Sega trademark when the game was powered up. The case was heard by Judge Barbara A. Caulfield. Sega argued that Accolade had infringed upon its copyrights because Accolade's games contained Sega's material. Accolade insisted that their use of Sega's material constituted fair use. However, Judge Caulfield did not accept this explanation since Accolade was a game manufacturer, their works were for financial gain, and because their works competed directly with Sega's licensed games, likely resulting in a sales decrease for Sega's games. Accolade's case was further hurt by a presentation by a Sega engineer named Takeshi Nagashima, who showed two Sega game cartridges that were able to run on the Genesis III without the trademark-displaying TMSS, and offered them to Accolade's defense team but would not reveal how that was possible. Ultimately, this would result in Accolade's defeat on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting future sales by Accolade of Genesis- compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering. Almost a week later, Accolade was also required by the court to recall all of their Genesis-compatible games. Appeal The Richard H. Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals Building, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Pasadena, California The decision in the district court ruling had been very costly to Accolade. According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, \\"Just to fight the injunction, we had to pay at least half a million dollars in legal fees.\\" On April 14, 1992, Accolade filed for a stay on the injunction pending appeal in the district court, but when the court did not rule by April 21, Accolade appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A stay was granted on the mandate to recall all of Accolade's Genesis games, but the injunction preventing further reverse engineering and development of Genesis software was maintained until August 28, when the Ninth Circuit ordered it dissolved pending the appeal review. In support of the appeal, the Computer & Communications Industry Association submitted an amicus curiae brief claiming that the district court had made errors in concluding that Accolade had infringed upon Sega's copyright by reverse engineering its software, extending copyright protection to method of operation, and failing to consider whether Accolade's games were substantially similar to Sega's copyrighted material. Amicus briefs were also submitted by the American Committee for Interoperable Systems, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, and copyright law professor Dennis S. Karjala from Arizona State University. In reviewing the case, the court considered several factors in its own analysis, examining trademark and copyright issues separately. As in the district court trial, Nagashima showed the court a game cartridge that ran on the Genesis that did not display the trademark logo. However, the court was not moved by this, deciding that Nagashima's cartridges showed what one could do with knowledge of the TMSS, which Accolade did not possess. According to the court, because knowledge of how to avoid displaying the trademark on the Genesis III was not information that was public to the industry, Sega's attempt to prove that the display of their trademark was not required for games to be played on the console was insufficient. Writing for the opinion of the court, Judge Stephen Reinhardt stated, \\"Sega knowingly risked two significant consequences: the false labeling of some competitors' products and the discouraging of other competitors from manufacturing Genesis-compatible games. Under the Lanham Act, the former conduct, at least, is clearly unlawful.\\" The court then went on to cite Anti-Monopoly v. General Mills Fun Group, which states in reference to the Lanham Act, \\"The trademark is misused if it serves to limit competition in the manufacture and sales of a product. That is the special province of the limited monopolies provided pursuant to the patent laws.\\" The judges in the case had decided that Sega had violated this provision of the act by utilizing its trademark to limit competition for software for its console. To determine the status of Accolade's claim of fair use of Sega's copyrighted game code, the court reviewed four criteria of fair use: the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount of the copyrighted work used, the purpose of use, and the effects of use on the market for the work. Of note to the judges in reviewing Sega's copyright claim was the difference in size between the TMSS file and the sizes of Accolade's games. As noted by Judge Reinhardt in writing the opinion of the court, the TMSS file \\"contains approximately twenty to twenty- five bytes of data. Each of Accolade's games contains a total of 500,000 to 1,500,000 bytes. According to Accolade employees, the header file is the only portion of Sega's code that Accolade copied into its own game programs.\\" This made the games overwhelmingly original content, and according to Judge Reinhardt, to the benefit of the public to be able to compete with Sega's licensed games, especially if the games were dissimilar as contended in the appeal. The court did not accept the argument that Accolade's games competed directly with Sega's, noting that there was no proof that any of Accolade's published games had diminished the market for any of Sega's games. Despite claims from Sega's attorneys that the company had invested much time and effort into developing the Genesis, and that Accolade was capitalizing on this time and energy, the court rejected these claims under the notion that the console was largely functional, and its functional principles were not protected under the Copyright Act of 1976. On the matter of reverse engineering as a process, the court concluded that \\"where disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law.\\" On August 28, 1992, the Ninth Circuit overturned the district court's verdict and ruled that Accolade's decompilation of the Sega software constituted fair use. The court's written opinion followed on October 20 and noted that the use of the software was non-exploitative, despite being commercial, and that the trademark infringement, being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system, was inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and the fault of Sega for causing false labeling. As a result of the verdict being overturned, the costs of the appeal were assessed to Sega. The injunction remained in force, however, because Sega petitioned the appeals court to rehear the case. Settlement On January 8, 1993, with Sega's petition for a rehearing still pending, the court took the unusual step of amending its October 20, 1992 opinion and lifted the injunction preventing Accolade from developing or selling Genesis software. This was followed by a formal denial of Sega's petition for a rehearing on January 26. As Accolade's counterclaim for false labeling under the Lanham Act was declined by the Ninth Circuit, this essentially left \\"each party as free to act as it was before the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief\\" while the district court considered the counterclaim. Sega and Accolade ultimately settled on April 30, 1993. As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released Barkley Shut Up and Jam! while under license. The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public. The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs. In an official statement, Sega of America chairman David Rosen expressed satisfaction with the settlement. According to Rosen, \\"This settlement is a satisfactory ending to what was a very complex set of issues. Not only are we pleased to settle this case amicably, we've also turned a corner in our association with Accolade and now look forward to a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship in the future.\\" Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, \\"We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and Game Gear systems throughout the world.\\" Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller. Impact Sega's logo Sega v. Accolade has been an influential case in matters involving reverse engineering of software and copyright infringement, and has been cited in numerous cases since 1993. The case has redefined how reverse engineering with unlicensed products is seen in legal issues involving copyright. Legally, the decision concurred that the nature of Accolade's work in reverse engineering the Sega Genesis was to access ideas that were deemed unprotected by copyright law, and could only be accessed by decompiling. By the verdict, the console's functional principles were established not to be protected by copyright, and that when no other means were available, reverse engineering the copyrighted software to access information about the console's functional principles is protected by the fair use doctrine. One such example of the precedent set by this case is Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corporation, which cited Sega v. Accolade in deciding that reverse engineering the Sony PlayStation BIOS was protected by fair use and was non- exploitative. Among the influences of the verdict include Sega v. Accolade's effect on the criteria for fair use and the responsibilities of trademark holders in legal examinations. Although Accolade had copied entire Genesis games in order to identify the TMSS, the court gave little weight to the criterion on the amount of the copyrighted work being copied, in light of the fact that Accolade had done so in order to create their own compatible software. Likewise, the nature of the work was also given less weight, essentially establishing a two-factor approach to evaluating fair use in the purpose of use and impact on the market. It was also the first time that the Lanham Act was interpreted to mean that confusion resulting from the placement of one's trademark on another work by means of a security program is the fault of the original registrant of the trademark. Sega v. Accolade also served to help establish that the functional principles of computer software cannot be protected by copyright law. Rather, the only legal protection to such principles can be through holding a patent or by trade secret. This aspect of the verdict has received criticism as well, citing that though the functional principles are not protectable under copyright law, the TMSS code is protectable, and that by allowing reverse engineering as fair use despite this security, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has encouraged the copying of legally protected programs for the exploration of unprotected functionality.

Cape Disappointment Station is also the site of the oldest search and rescue station within the Thirteenth Coast Guard District. The station's Area of Responsibility reaches from Ocean Park on the Washington Coast south to Tillamook Head on the Oregon Coast. Official web page, National Motor Lifeboat School, US Coast Guard official website. A 47-foot motor lifeboat in heavy surf Overview The station has nine search and rescue boats, including the motor lifeboat Triumph (52'-SPC-HWX), two motor lifeboats (47'-MLB), and two Defender class response boats (25'-RBS). The 52'-SPC-HWX and the 47'-MLB have all been designed for operations in heavy surf conditions and are capable of being rolled over by breaking swells and re-right themselves with minimal damage. Also colocated with the station is the oldest lighthouse on the Northwest Coast of the United States, Cape Disappointment Light, marking the north side of the Columbia River Bar. Less than two miles (3 km) to the northwest is North Head Light, which provides a beacon for the northern approaches to the Columbia River Bar. The station's primary missions include providing search and rescue to commercial and recreational mariners within of the Columbia River entrance and providing a maritime law enforcement presence near the approaches to the Columbia River including execution of homeland security missions. Commonly known as Station Cape \\"D\\", station crewmembers respond to 100-200 calls for assistance every year. The station's heaviest workload occurs during the months of early June through mid-September, when an abundance of recreational boaters transit the Columbia River entrance in search of salmon and bottom fish. This area is regarded as one of the most treacherous river bars in the world. Because of the large number of shipwrecks near the river entrance it is often called \\"The Graveyard of the Pacific.\\" During winter storms, wind-driven ocean swells often reach a height of 20‚Äì30 feet (6‚Äì9 m) at the entrance of the bar. With the combination of strong outgoing tides and large incoming swells, large surf conditions can exist in and around the bar entrance. The Cape Disappointment headland was first charted as \\"San Roque\\" by a Spanish explorer named Bruno de Heceta while exploring the Northwest Coast in August 1775. Heceta recognized this was probably the mouth of a large river but was unable to explore the entrance, since his crewmembers were weak, suffering from scurvy. Using Heceta's navigational charts during an expedition along the West Coast of North America in 1788, Lieutenant John Meares of the British Royal Navy attempted to locate \\"San Roque.\\" After exploring the area, Lt. Meares decided that no river entrance or channel existed among the shoals at the base of \\"San Roque\\" so Lt. Meares changed the name of the rocky headland to Cape Disappointment, a name that has described the headland since July 1788. Captain Robert Gray first accomplished crossing the bar several years later on May 11, 1792 aboard the Columbia Rediviva. Gray and his crewmembers successfully crossed the treacherous bar and anchored in Baker Bay to trade goods with the Chinook Indians who populated the region. The river was named in honor of this first passage. The first U. S. Life-Saving Service station at Cape Disappointment was built on the site of Fort Canby in 1877. For the first five years volunteers manned the station entirely. In 1882, the first full- time Life Saving Service crew was sworn in at this site. Then in 1915, the Life Saving Service merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard. The existing station was first occupied in February 1967 and is currently the site for Station Cape Disappointment and the National Motor Lifeboat School.

In general terms, a debug port is not necessary for end-use function and is often hidden or disabled in finished products. When constituted in a high availability or safety critical system, a debug port may continue to operate as a system monitor for integrity validation in the finished product. In low- cost or high-volume electronics, debug ports are sometimes left enabled to avoid costs of design changes, and can be used by modders and hackers to gain control of the device and/or access to extra functionality. Due to their high complexity, debug ports are nearly universal in microprocessors (CPUs) and microcontrollers (MCUs). These are discussed below. Hardware debug ports * Ubiquitous JTAG ports on ICs * Low Pin Count debug port on the original Xbox, used by modders * Serial Wire Debug (SWD), ubiquitous on Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers * Background Debug Mode interface (BDM) * Program and Debug Interface * Nexus debug Debug ports on microprocessors Microprocessors are exceptionally complex devices which commonly contain more than a billion transistors internally and sometimes exceed more than one trillion.. Debug ports on microcontrollers Microcontrollers are generally smaller than mainstream CPUs, but have now evolved so far into system on a chip (SoC) territory, that an MCU can be nearly the only complex chip remaining on an end-use application board (with additional chips devoted to specialized electrical functions such as level shifting and enhanced ESD protection). SoC MCUs usually internal flash memory as a program store and may also contain internal EEPROM-based configuration fuses whose correct configuration is essential to the MCU powering up in the correct operating mode; the debug port may be the only way to initially configure the clock tree or to load the first software program post-manufacture. USB Device Firmware Upgrade Since around 2010, a broad class of MCUs now have integrated USB peripherals with device firmware upgrade (DFU) in factory ROM. This class of MCUs appeals to hobbyists who do not wish to invest in the hardware tools needed to access specialized debug ports such as JTAG. These devices are designed to be resistant to being bricked. A bad firmware load is easily recovered by holding a special pin in the active state, which caused the chip to boot up using its internal factory ROM, which makes a programming interface available through its build-in USB controller. DFU can be viewed as a form of debug port implemented in software rather than hardware. However, this largely defeats the debug functionality of a dedicated hardware debug port, as it is inherently fragile to debug software which also implements your debug interface‚Äîbut only when functioning correctly.

Maurice Bessy, Raymond Chirat and Andr√© Bernard; ; entry 235 is a 1969 Italian-French psychological thriller film directed by Jacques Deray, starring Alain Delon, Romy Schneider, Maurice Ronet and Jane Birkin. Set in summertime on the C√¥te d'Azur, it is a drama of sexual jealousy and possessiveness. Both French and English-language versions of the film were made, with the actors filmed speaking English for the international release, which was unusual at a time when movies were always either dubbed or subtitled. That 114-minute international release, shorter than the French version, also had a slightly different editing.  Plot  Jean-Paul, a writer and Marianne, his girlfriend of just over two years, are holidaying at a friend's villa. There is a tension in their relationship which excites Marianne: the film begins with a scene in which they are together beside the villa's swimming pool and she urges him to claw her back. He does as she asks, but then throws her into the pool and jumps in after her. In a later scene he takes a branch and uses it to lash her bare buttocks, playfully but with a force that increases as the scene cuts away. Harry, an old friend and record producer who was Marianne's lover before Jean-Paul, arrives for a visit, surprising the couple by bringing along his 18-year-old daughter Penelope, whose existence they had not previously known about. The four stay together and Harry draws Marianne back towards him as the days go by. Taunting Jean-Paul for having given up serious writing to work in advertising, Harry drinks a great deal and throws a surprise party while Jean- Paul, a recovering alcoholic, stays sober. Meanwhile, it becomes clear that Penelope neither likes nor respects her father, whom she has barely known while growing up. She and Jean-Paul become close and spend a day alone together by the sea. That night, while the women are asleep, the two men finally confront each other. Harry falls into the pool and is too drunk to swim. Jean-Paul, who has also been drinking, at first stops him from climbing out of the water, then deliberately pushes Harry under and holds him down until he drowns. He covers up the crime by hiding Harry's wet clothes, making it look like an accident. After the funeral, a policeman, Inspector L√©v√™que, visits the house more than once. He confides to Marianne his reasons for doubting the story of an accident. When she tells Jean-Paul, he confesses everything to her, and she goes to see the evidence that would have given him away. But when she does not give it to the police, the inquiry is dropped. Marianne takes Penelope to the airport and sees her off as she returns to her mother. She and Jean-Paul are then about to leave the villa when she tells him that they will not go together. She calls for a taxi but he places his hand on the telephone, cutting off her call and silencing her. In the end, neither leaves that day, and in the film's final shot they stand side by side looking out the window at the swimming pool, and then embrace. Cast *Romy Schneider as Marianne *Alain Delon as Jean-Paul *Maurice Ronet as Harry Lannier *Jane Birkin as Penelope Lannier * Paul Crauchet as Inspector L√©v√™que Production The filming began August 19 and finished October 19, 1968. French designer Andr√© Courr√®ges created many custom pieces for the film, such as the swimsuits worn by Schneider and Birkin. It was the first of the nine films Delon and director Jacques Deray made together, and the only one the star didn't produce. It also marked the onscreen reunion of Delon and Romy Schneider, his co-star in Christine (1958) and romantic partner in 1958‚Äì1963. It was during the making of this film that the Markovic Affair broke out. The body of Stevan Markovic, Delon's bodyguard, was discovered in a public dump in the village of √âlancourt, Yvelines, on October 1, 1968.

The Sunday Times Digital Archive. accessed 5 April 2014 The movie was released in the UK as The Sinners to limited box office response. It was released in Italy with twenty minutes cut out, but was a popular success. The Los Angeles Times called it a \\"handsome, stunningly designed film\\" which was at its best in \\"the deft way in which it coolly depicts how beautiful, chic people, dedicated to a sophisticate, amoral view of love, can be utterly defenseless against an onslaught of passion ‚Äì a favorite Gallic theme.\\" The Guardian wrote: \\"Erotic languour turns gradually into fear and then horror in this gripping and superbly controlled psychological thriller\\" where \\"something in the very lineaments of the pool itself creates their own awful destiny: it is a primordial swamp of desire, a space in which there is nothing to do but laze around, furtively looking at semi-naked bodies.\\" Remake The 2016 film A Bigger Splash, directed by Luca Guadagnino and starring Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Dakota Johnson, is loosely based on La Piscine. Trivia Excerpt of the film was used in the Christian Dior Eau Sauvage cologne advertising campaign drawing on the legacy of Alain Delon. Alain Delon said in an interview that he cannot watch this film again. His ex- lover Romy Schneider and good friend Maurice Ronet both died prematurely and under tragic circumstances.

Trimaran is headquartered in New York City and founded by former investment bankers from Drexel Burnham Lambert. Trimaran's predecessors were early investors in telecom and Internet businesses, most notably backing Global Crossing in 1997. Trimaran also led the first leveraged buyout of an integrated electric utility. Since 1995, Trimaran and its successor entities have invested approximately $1.6 billion of equity in fifty-nine companies through transactions totaling more than $10 billion in total value. In addition, Trimaran's debt business has managed approximately $1.5 billion of leveraged loans across four collateralized loan obligation vehicles.Trimaran Capital Fund Management (company website, accessed August 27, 2010) Since 2006, one of its co-founders, Andrew Heyer, lead a spinout of a portion of its team to form Mistral Equity Partners In 2008, the two remaining managing partners entered into a venture with Nelson Peltz‚Äôs Trian to create a new debt-focused business development company. The firm is named for the trimaran, a multi-hulled boat consisting of a main hull and two smaller outrigger hulls. The firm's principals had used nautical terms to describe their predecessor entities including argosy, a merchant ship, or a fleet of such ships and caravelle, a small, highly maneuverable, two- or three-masted ship. History Trimaran Capital Partners was founded in 2000 by former Drexel Burnham Lambert and CIBC World Markets investment bankers Jay Bloom, Andrew Heyer, and Dean Kehler. The firm traces its roots back to the 1995 creation of the CIBC Argosy Merchant funds, a series of merchant banking investment funds managed on behalf of CIBC, and before that to the 1990 founding of the boutique investment banking firm The Argosy Group. The Argosy Group The Argosy Group was a New York-based boutique investment bank founded in February 1990, and is Trimaran's earliest predecessor. Founded as a 9-person advisory firm by Bloom, Heyer, and Kehler, Argosy was one of several private equities and investment banking firms to spring up in the wake of the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert.The Drexel Diaspora. New York Times, February 6, 2005 (Accessed August 19, 2010) Before Drexel, the three bankers had all worked together at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Kehler and Bloom had worked together previously at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb and were joined by Heyer when Lehman was acquired by Shearson/American Express. The Argosy team had been involved in many of the most prominent high yield financings of the preceding two decades, for companies including RJR Nabisco, Beatrice Foods, and Storer Communications.Anders, George. Merchants of debt: KKR and the mortgaging of American business, 2002. pp. 59, 94, 302 The Argosy Group focused on debt underwriting, private placements, sales and trading, proprietary special situation investing, and restructuring advisory assignments for highly leveraged companies.

Crain's New York Business, May 5, 1997 (Accessed August 19, 2010) In 1995, CIBC Wood Gundy, later CIBC World Markets, acquired the Argosy Group, the predecessor of Trimaran The acquisition of Argosy marked an aggressive push by CIBC into the U.S. investment banking business. Prior to that point, CIBC had never done a junk bond deal. Argosy's three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk bond deals of the 1980s while at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 52 Argosy employees that CIBC acquired would constitute the core of what would become CIBC's High Yield Group and the CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds that were responsible for, among other things, the $2 billion windfall that CIBC would earn from its early investments in Global Crossing. The Argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as Caravelle Funds I and II.Caravelle Advisors Launches Second CDO Fund, Caravelle II . Press Release, December 14, 2000 (Accessed August 19, 2010) With the acquisition of Argosy in 1995 and Oppenheimer & Co. in 1997, the center of gravity of CIBC's investment banking operations began to shift toward the United States. CIBC's High Yield Group began to develop a reputation for financing complex leveraged buyout transactions and worked closely with several of the leading private equity firms.CIBC Wood Gundy Makes a Name in Junk Bonds.

Lee Partners, and Willis Stein & Partners. Bloom, Heyer and Kehler took on increasing responsibilities within CIBC World Markets. Ultimately, as Vice Chairmen of the bank and co-heads of Leveraged Finance, the three Argosy founders had responsibilities for leveraged loan and high-yield sales, trading and research, debt private placements, restructuring advisory and financial sponsor coverage.CIBC World Markets: The Leveraged Finance Group.

Bloom, Heyer and Kehler, the heads of the CIBC Argosy Merchant funds and all former Drexel bankers, were former associates of Winnick from his days in the 1980s as a salesman at Drexel Burnham Lambert under Michael Milken. They were also instrumental in providing Global Crossing with $35 million in equity financing before the company went public. CIBC would ultimately realize a gain estimated to be $2 billion from its relatively small equity investment in Global Crossing, making it one of the most profitable investments by a financial institution in the 1990s. The investment is also thought to have personally generated millions of dollars for Bloom, Heyer and Kehler.How Executives Prospered as Global Crossing Collapsed. The New York Times, February 11, 2002 (Accessed August 19, 2010)The Drexel Connection at Global Crossing. Business Week, March 11, 2002 (Accessed August 19, 2010) CIBC's investment in Global Crossing provided a considerable boost for its investment banking operations in the U.S. and for Bloom, Heyer and Kehler. In fact, CIBC's gain on its investment in Global Crossing would represent more than 20% of the bank's profits in 2000.Bank Works To Improve Its Image In Canada. New York Times, February 27, 2004 Trimaran was founded in 2000, effectively on the back of the success of the Global Crossing investment.

Business Wire, April 11, 2001 () (Accessed August 19, 2010) Spinout from CIBC World Markets (2000‚Äì2002) The investment banking operations of CIBC World Markets reached their peak in 1999 and 2000, when the bank cracked the top ten of U.S. issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory. From 1995 through 2000, the High Yield Group at CIBC World Markets had grown to more than 120 and had raised more than $80 billion of high yield debt. Following the crash of the dot-com bubble and the shutdown of the high yield markets in late 2000, CIBC World Markets began to suffer a series of setbacks. In July 2001, the Wall Street Journal profiled CIBC World Markets, chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of Wall Street's league table rankings.\\"CIBC World Markets Trips in Big Leagues.\\" The Wall Street Journal, August 3, 2001 (Accessed August 19, 2010) At the same time, the High Yield Group was restructured with the original Argosy Group founders focusing their responsibilities on their new Trimaran Capital Partners fund and the older CIBC Argosy Merchant funds. Bloom, Heyer and Kehler were succeeded by managing directors Edward Levy and Bruce Spohler, who had worked previously at Argosy and Drexel, together with Bill Phoenix.CIBC World Markets Appoints New Vice- Chairmen. Business Wire, June 18, 2001 (Accessed August 19, 2010) By 2002, as a result of these developments, the CIBC implemented a strategy to reallocate resources and capital away from the riskier CIBC World Markets division in favor of its retail operations. As part of this reallocation, and in an effort to reduce conflicts between the bank's principal investments and its financial sponsor clients, the Trimaran operations would subsequently spinout completely from CIBC World Markets.

Although Trimaran is still in operation managing its existing investment funds, the key professionals in the firm have embarked on a number of different ventures. Mistral Equity Partners spinout (2007) Following the failure of Trimaran to raise its third fund, in March 2007, Andrew Heyer, one of the three founders of Trimaran, left the firm to launch a new buyout firm.

He is known for his novel Streik from 1891, and for his collections of stories issued between 1887 and 1895, Sogor (includes the story \\"Berre ein Hund\\"), Vossa-Stubba, Nye Vossa-stubbar and Sivle-Stubbar. Among his poetry collections is Bers√∏glis- og andre Viser from 1895.

During his childhood he frequently moved from place to place, growing up along with different relatives. He attended a folk high school in Sogndal when he was 15 years old. In 1875, he moved to Christiania for studies, planning to become a priest. Because of illness these plans were abandoned and he aborted his studies. He then started a literary career.
