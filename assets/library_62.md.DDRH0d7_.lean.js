Biography  Magis was born in Brussels. He graduated in directing at the lnstitut des Arts de Diffusion after directing his final film Le Secret des Dieux, in 2004. This short film, a mockumentary, uses the mad cow scandal as a pretext for an investigative narrative, in order to question the critical relationship between viewers and the media. According to Muriel Andrin, Professor of Writing and Film Analysis at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, \\"Magis kidnaps television images in favour of another story, a fake documentary, a docu-fiction, following in the footsteps of Peter Watkins or William Karel, on the thin line where reality meets imagination.\\". Between 2005 and 2006, he worked as a director at Alterface Projects and wrote and directed films for the interactive educational game \\"Future Dome \\" for the scientific center Our Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh. Between 2007 and 2010, he worked as a director on the RTBF news. At the same time, he works as an assistant stage director. In 2007, he assisted Nele Paxinou in the travelling troupe of the Baladins du Miroir, during the creation of the adaptation of Tristan and Iseult, written by Paul Emond. In 2011, he goes on to assist Olivier Antoine on the graduation show \\"Aphasia\\" at the √âcole sup√©rieure des arts du cirque, in Brussels. In 2011, he assists director Sofia Betz in the creation of the play \\"De la n√©cessit√© des grenouilles\\", written by Virginie Thirion, at Atelier 210. In 2013, he directed his first creative documentary, Ion, produced by D√©rives (Dardenne brothers and Julie Fr√®res). This film tells the story of Ion Beleaua, a visually impaired former political refugee, who works as a police auxiliary in Li√®ge. Broadcast on Belgian television and awarded in numerous international festivals, the documentary also received the Special Mention at the SCAM Discovery Prizes, audiovisual section In 2014 he directed Les Fleurs de l'Ombre, a documentary diving into Romania, in a Miss competition for visually impaired women. This competition organized by the Romanian Association of the Blind is not ordinary, however: it rewards the inner beauty of the participants. In 2015, the film won the Best Documentary (ex-aequo) Award at the South East European Film Festival in Los Angeles. In 2015, he directed two episodes of the Babel Express television documentary collection, broadcast on ARTE and RTBF. The following year, he collaborated on the documentary trilogy Archibelge!, a television serie questioning the ugliness of architecture in Belgium. Drawing up \\"an absurd and surreal panorama of Belgian architecture\\", this trilogy was broadcast on the Belgian national channels RTBF and CANVAS \\"tells our country through its architecture, its urban planning and through the eyes of those who live there\\". Magis directed the first episode, entitled \\"Brussels, or the quest for identity\\", and questioned the complex roots of the urban and architectural problems in Brussels. His first short fiction film, May Day, co-directed with Fedrik De Beul, was released in 2017. This film plunges the viewer into the heart of a job strangely put up for auction. Broadcast on RTBF, BeTV, CANVAS, Canal+, TV5 Monde, May Day is rewarded at many international festivals. It is also shortlisted for the Oscars 2019. In addition to directing, Magis teaches comparative directing at the Ecole Sup√©rieure de R√©alisation Audiovisuelle (ESRA) in Brussels, documentary cinema at the SAE Institute in Brussels and also to teachers from the Wallonia-Brussels Federation via the Institut de la Formation en cours de carri√®re (IFC).

Intended to win the distance record in closed circuit and then in a straight line, the first record attempts of the Potez 34 were punctuated by tyre punctures and oil leaks. Modifications were made including the exchange of the Farman engine with a lighter Hispano-Suiza and the adoption of a metal propeller. On 18 June 1929, the French distance in closed circuit record was beaten over a course of flown by Lionel de Marmier and Louis Favreau, but the world record could not be broken due to a technical failure. On 25 June 1929, the same crew attempted to break the distance record in a straight line, flying to the Far East, but propeller vibrations necessitated a landing in Tunisia and the failure of the attempt.

Lewis' law gives a relationship between the size and the shape of epithelial cells. It states that the average apical area \\\\bar{A}_nof an epithelial cell is linearly related to its neighbor number n. It is a phenomenological law that was first described in the cucumber epidermis by the morphologist Frederic Thomas Lewis in 1928. The simplest version of Lewis' law can be expressed as \\\\frac{\\\\overline{A_n}}{\\\\overline{A}}=\\\\frac{n-2}{4}, which reads: The average apical area of a cell with n neighbors (divided by the average apical area of all cells) is proportional to its shape. While neighbor number distributions change throughout organogenesis, the average neighbor number of epithelial cells is \\\\bar{n}\\\\approx 6, which can be traced back to Euler's formula for polygons.  Discovery  Frederic Thomas Lewis noticed that epidermal cells display a patterning similar to froths, which led him to quantify and analyze the sizes and shapes of epidermal cells.  Confirmation and mechanism  A variety of empirical studies in different epithelial tissues have confirmed Lewis' law. It has been suggested that the emergence of Lewis' law on the apical surface of epithelia is a result of the concurrence of * the tendency of cells to minimize intercellular contact surface energy, and * the distribution of apical cell areas (as a result of cellular processes such as cell division). According to this theory, the observed tissue-specific polygon distributions and Lewis' law arise as a compromise in order to maintain tissue integrity.  Importance  In order to understand morphogenetic events, i.e. the growth and shaping of tissues and organs, it is necessary to analyze the packing of cells into tissues. In that context, an analysis of patterning processes can help to identify the underlying mechanisms that drive morphogenesis.

It was discovered by citizen scientists while analysing data from the Kepler spacecraft's K2 mission, and was announced on 7 January 2019. K2-288 is the third transiting planet system identified by the Exoplanet Explorers program, after the six planets of K2-138 and the three planets of K2-233. K2-288Bb is likely to be in the habitable zone of its host star, and thus may be capable on supporting life, though the planet's composition is unknown. Discovery K2-288 was observed by the Kepler space telescope during Campaign 4 of its extended K2 \\"Second Light\\" mission, lasting from April through September 2015. A group of astronomers looked through this data to try and find transiting exoplanets. However, because of Kepler's decreased stability after the failure of two reaction wheels, the start of each campaign had extreme systematic errors, and these few days of data were discarded by the team. For K2-288, they only found two transits in the remaining data, not enough to merit follow-up studies. As a result, this system was pushed aside for more convincing candidates. After the first analysis, the same team used better methods to model the systematic errors caused by K2 and re-processed all the Campaign 4 data they had. However, instead of looking through it all again by eye, they decided to upload it to the new Zooniverse project Exoplanet Explorers in April 2017. Among other systems like K2-138, citizen scientists also spotted three transits of the red dwarf star EPIC 210693462. Several volunteers started a lengthy discussion thread about the system, concluding that, with the current transit and stellar parameters, the planet candidate was very similar in both size and temperature to Earth. This caught the attention of the original team of astronomers and another at NASA Goddard who independently found the three transits at the same time, and follow-up observations were started. The group, led by Adina Feinstein, started by obtaining spectra of the star using the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, where they noticed that there was a secondary companion star. This meant there was a possibility that the second star was creating the transit signal, and it wasn't a real planet. However, the team concluded that it was far more likely to be an exoplanet and not a false positive. They used data from Kepler, as well as a transit observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, to determine which star the planet orbited. Observations and modelling suggested the transit data was most compatible with the planet transiting the smaller, secondary star. The team was then able to calculate the radius, orbit, and temperature of the planet, and they announced their results at the 233rd American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle on January 7, 2019. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= K2-288Bb is unusual for having a radius not commonly seen among most exoplanets. At 1.90 , it falls within the so-called Fulton Gap between 1.5 and 2.0 . This is the range of sizes where rocky super-Earths start to accumulate thick volatile layers and turn into mini-Neptunes. Planets in the middle of this gap are uncommon, and as such, not much is known about them. K2-288Bb could either be a low- density mini-Neptune like GJ 9827 d, or a large rocky super-Earth like LHS 1140 b. Its mass is currently unknown and would require additional studies using the Radial velocity method to be determined. Based on its size, K2-288Bb is probably still undergoing atmospheric evolution and/or erosion. The planet is also orbiting in or near the habitable zone of K2-288B, where temperatures are just right for a planet to host liquid water with the right atmosphere. K2-288 Bb has an equilibrium temperature of (lower than Earth's ) and receives less sunlight than Earth. =Orbit and rotation= K2-288Bb has a close orbit around the second, smaller star of the binary system. It orbits every 31.393 days at a distance of about 0.164 AU. For comparison, the Earth's Solar System's innermost planet, Mercury, orbits every 88 days at 0.38 AU. However, due to the small size of the host star, K2-288Bb is well within the habitable zone. In the unlikely possibility that the planet orbits the primary, it would have a semi-major axis of 0.231 AU and still reside in the habitable zone. K2-288Bb is probably tidally locked regardless of which star it orbits; one side of the planet would permanently face the host, while the other side would be always facing away. =Host stars= K2-288Bb is within a binary system of two red dwarfs. The primary, K2-288A, is 52% the mass and 45% the radius of the Sun, while the secondary, K2-288B, is 33% the mass and 32% the radius. They are both much cooler and dimmer than the Sun, with temperatures of 3584 K and 3341 K, and are 0.03236 and 0.01175 times as luminous as the Sun, which has a temperature of 5772 K. Both stars are also rather metal-poor, with metallicities of -0.29 [Fe/H] for the primary, and -0.21 [Fe/H] for the secondary. In comparison, the Sun has a metallicity of 0.00 [Fe/H]. K2-288A and K2-288B orbit each other at a distance of about 55 AU, around six times the distance from Saturn to the Sun. Potential habitability It is unknown if K2-288Bb is capable of supporting life. On one hand, it is likely well within the habitable zone of its star, with a temperate equilibrium temperature of about 226 K. However, because of its radius within the Fulton Gap, there is significant uncertainty in its composition. K2-288Bb could be a potentially habitable rocky or water-rich world, but it might also be a hostile gas planet.

Later she and her mother emigrated to New York City, where her real dance career started. Miriam started to take lessons at George Balanchine' School of American Ballet (1941‚Äì1945).  American Career  In 1942, she turned towards modern dance and joined the Martha Graham Dance Company. Later she danced also as a soloist in companies of Doris Humphrey,Manning, S. (2004).

Original edition, 1949. 92nd Street Y (YMHA) and member of the New Dance Group Studio. At the YMHA, she was the first to teach a combined technique of Ballet and Modern Dance. Pandor also taught movement for singers and actors.Jackson, Naomi, M. (2000). Converging Movements - Modern Dance and Jewish Culture at the 92nd Street Y. Wesleyan University Press. Middletown, Connecticut. Throughout the 1950s, Pandor was politically active. In 1949, she traveled to Budapest in order to participate at the World Festival of Youth and Students. Back in the US she joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), participated in sit-ins and demonstrations. She choreographed the piece \\"Salem Witch Hunt\\" and founded her own Concert Company in New York, which performed at the Brooklyn Museum and Henry Street Playhouse. In 1968, Pandor spent nine months at the dancing school \\"Cuban Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna\\" in Cuba. New experiences and the collection of Cuban music helped her to form new expressive possibilities to incorporate in her New York Studio. Back in New York City she took up writing classes and started writing for the CPUSA's daily newspaper People's Daily World. She wrote poetry for cultural events of Westside Marxist Center, and taught Theater Workshops. In 1972, she was director of the Repertory Dancers, at the time New Jersey‚Äôs only professional modern dance company. Increasing health issues forced Pandor to rethink her professional perspective as a dance teacher and writing became an even stronger tool for her. She found, however, that in the mid-1970s interests of neither dance nor political journals in the USA were interdisciplinary enough for her work.  European career  In 1976 she decided to move to the GDR, hoping she could contribute to the socialist society. She worked as a choreographer and English teacher and translator. After 1990 she also performed as an actress in independent progressive theater productions. During this time, she was eventually able to make valuable contributions to drama and pantomime students. Pandor continued writing and translating for progressive causes. Pandor was viewed highly as a dancer as reflected repetitively by the renown dance critic John Martin of the New York Times. Throughout most of her life she was a strong fighter not only for her ideas on dance, art and society, but also to combat her chronic pain and immobility. Miriam Pandor died July 31, 2016. Ideas about dance, art and society Positive impulses at the World Festival of Youth and Students in Budapest, Hungary 1949 pertaining to the content of her choreography and dance presented an important step towards strengthening Pandor's goal to include socio-political comments in her art. She felt the necessity to fight against racism in the society, but also in art.Graff, E. (1997). Stepping Left: Dance and Politics in New York City, 1928-1942. Duke University Press. As a dance teacher Pandor tried to impart a realism in dance to her students. Dance should be based on the real body movements of the people, restoring the torn communication between the artists and the workers, the desired audience of her work. Art in its entirety can only be meaningful if it arises from understandable and authentic content, expressed by realistic forms of movement merged into modern dance. This is how Pandor's own system of socially conditioned dance motivation emerges. It also includes the appropriation of Afro-American jazz through dance.

This is typically carried out using one of the available fit-testing hardware and software systems. The effectiveness is typically measured as a personal attenuation rating (PAR) which is subtracted from the known noise exposure to estimate the total noise exposure a single person has when wearing the tested hearing protection device (HPD). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Hearing Conservation Association Best Practice Bulletin: Hearing Protection Fit- Testing: Hearing Protection- Emerging Trends: Individual Fit Testing describes existing testing methods and how to incorporate them in hearing conservation programs. Hearing protection devices such as earplugs or earmuffs must be worn correctly for the wearer to be protected from noise. Correct use of hearing protection includes: * Choosing the most appropriate hearing protection device, both with appropriate level of attenuation and appropriate fit for the individual. Ideally, the device should limit the sound intensity that reaches the ear to levels below 85 dBA. If the attenuation does not limit the noise levels to that level, other alternatives should be sought. If the attenuation is greater than that, it can also interfere with the HPD use. * Wearing or inserting the hearing protection device correctly so it seals the wearer's ear canal, using the \\"roll-pull-hold\\" method for foam earplugs, and ensuring earmuffs create an unbroken seal around each ear. Fit-testing hearing protection ensures both an appropriate choice of hearing protection, and allows for the professional administering the fit-test to train proper techniques for wear.  Personal attenuation rating (PAR)  Similar to a noise reduction rating (NRR) required on hearing protection devices in the United States, a personal attenuation rating (PAR) is obtained from an attenuation measurement at one or more than one frequency. However, the PAR is regarded as more accurate than the NRR because it is calculated per individual and per hearing protection device, while NRR is a generalized estimate of potential sound reduction based on the protection provided to a small population of people. It gives the evaluator an estimate of the total noise exposure an individual is receiving when wearing hearing protection.  Fit- testing methods  Although all fit-testing systems assess hearing protection devices to give a resulting personal attenuation rating, there are a few different types of technology that have been developed, with real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) as the established standard under ANSI/ASA S12.6. It is important to note that the outcome measure generated by each system varies from a simple pass/fail to a quantitative personal attenuation rating (PAR) and can be interpreted differently to determine the effectiveness of hearing protection or calculate total noise exposure. The different methods used to measure the attenuation provided by HPDs are as follows: = Real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) = REAT is the most commonly used type of fit-testing technology used in commercial systems, and is considered the \\"gold standard\\" for fit-testing. REAT technology measures the difference in auditory (hearing) thresholds without hearing protection (unoccluded) and with hearing protection (occluded). Most REAT systems use a subjective measure to determine auditory thresholds much like a hearing test where the subject indicates when sound is heard at various frequencies. For earmuffs this must be tested in an acoustic chamber, however for earplugs, headphones can be used, making the test easier for commercial use. For noncritical screening, REAT can be performed using a web browser and standard audio devices. = Microphone-in- real-ear (MIRE) = Also referred to as F-MIRE (field microphone in real ear). This method measures attenuation by placing a small microphone inside the ear canal while hearing protection is worn. Sound pressure levels (SPL) are measured inside and outside of the ear simultaneously and used to calculate a PAR. = Loudness balance = This method first has the subject listen to tones with headphones and \\"match\\" loudness between both ears until tones sound equally loud on both sides. Then an earplug is placed in one ear while the baseline procedure is repeated to match loudness in both ears, then the procedure is repeated a third time so both ears are tested individually with earplugs. This calculates a personal attenuation rating based on the loudness of the sound delivered to the unprotected ear when it matches the protected ear.  Use of Fit-testing as a training tool  There has been evidence that including fit-testing as a part of employee training for correct hearing protection device use increases user ability for proper insertion on follow- up.

Major television networks broadcast the president's speech as well as the Democratic response. Trump used the speech to push for Congress to fund the construction of a larger barrier or wall at the border with Mexico, in order to fulfill a key promise of his campaign. Trump's refusal to sign a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open in the absence of funding for the wall had led to the shutdown. The address lasted just under ten minutes and was Trump's first to be televised from the Oval Office. Content During the speech, Trump blamed the shutdown on Congressional Democrats, despite saying in a televised meeting held with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on December 11 that he would be \\"proud to shut down the government for border security\\" and that he would not blame the Democrats. Trump reiterated his demand for $5.7 billion for the border wall, which he said would be made of \\"steel slats\\" instead of concrete, as previously assumed. He cited statistics he claimed were caused by illegal immigration to the United States, such as the opioid epidemic: ‚ÄúEvery week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across our southern border‚Äù, and high crime rates among illegal immigrants: ‚ÄúIn the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records,‚Äù Trump also said that \\"Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with other Democrats.\\" and: \\"America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.

They also wrote that his claim that, ‚ÄúEvery day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country,‚Äù was \\"misleading\\". Democratic response Video of the Democratic response Leaders of the Democratic Party requested equal airtime. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer delivered a response to Trump's speech, blaming Trump for the shutdown, saying \\"his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall ‚Äî a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.\\" The New York Times has determined Schumer's statement that \\"[no] president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\\" needed context but was true, indirectly through Americans' family members. Network coverage Trump's administration requested airtime from the networks one day in advance. Trump then announced via Twitter: \\"I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern\\". The speech was carried live by the major over-the-air and cable news networks in the U.S., eliciting criticism that the media was giving the president a free platform to possibly make \\"inflammatory or misleading statements\\". Critics compared the favorable treatment of Trump by the media to the refusal of networks to air a November 2014 speech on immigration by President Barack Obama for being \\"too political\\". Prior to the speech, Joe Lockhart, Daniel Pfeiffer, Jay Rosen, and Connie Schultz, among others, advocated for media to fact check Trump's comments. Mika Brzezinski said networks \\"should refuse to turn over the airwaves to Donald Trump tonight for what they know objectively to be a steady stream of lies\\". Ted Koppel said Trump should be given the \\"benefit of the doubt\\". The address and Democratic response drew an estimated total of 43.3 million viewers not including livestreams according to a Nielsen report. The address brought in a 28.1 rating and the response brought in a 29.3 rating in metered markets on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC.  Transcript  President Donald Trump: \\"My fellow Americans: Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don‚Äôt act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis ‚Äî a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States ‚Äî a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It‚Äôs a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting- edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It‚Äôs also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year ‚Äî vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator Chuck Schumer ‚Äî who you will be hearing from later tonight ‚Äî has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected President. Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security. Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don‚Äôt build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized. America‚Äôs heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl. Over the last several years, I‚Äôve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I‚Äôve held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken? To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you and goodnight.\\" Fundraising A Trump Pence campaign fundraising email titled ‚ÄúOfficial Secure the Border Fund‚Äù was distributed prior to the speech and asked supporters to donate.

It is closely related to Lyophyllum decastes. It is hot climate fungus species common in Mediterranean coniferous woodlands. Often growing in clusters.  Taxonomy  Lyophyllum littoralis was first described as a separate species in 1998 by Italian mycologist Marco Contu.  Description  The smooth cap is 5‚Äì15 cm (2‚Äì6 in) wide mottled grey to brownish grey colour, with darker splotches tending to be around the edge. Often covered in a whitish powder. Cap shape in younger specimen tends to be round and becomes convoluted with age, with the cap edge pointing downwards. The stipe is 1.5‚Äì4 cm (0.6‚Äì1.6 in) high and up to 0.4-1.5 cm wide and has no ring nor volva. Often hollow the stipe ranges from white at the top to grey at the bottom with older specimen being grey The gills are white tending to pale yellow-grey in older specimen. the gills densely packed, can be free (unattached to the stipe) or slightly sliding to the stipe. The flesh is thin and rubbery, and does not break easily, especially the stipe. It has no discernible smell or taste prior to cooking. White spore in bulk. Spores 4.5-5.5 (6) √ó 4.5-5.5 Œºm, globular, smooth, cyanophile, often with central guttula. Tetrasporic, trivial basidia. GAF present in all tissues.  Distribution and habitat  Lyophyllum littoralis is found in Mediterranean woodlands, where fruiting bodies appear under conifers, particularly pine, from November to January. They generally appear in clumps connected to the same base, but can also appear individually.  Edibility  Collected Lyophyllum littoralis mushrooms of various ages With a taste reminiscent of fried chicken and texture that retains its firmness after frying, the species is a good edible.

The company develops and supports CONVERGE CFD software, a general purpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver.  Company history  Convergent Science was founded in 1997 by a group of graduate students, including Eric Pomraning, Keith Richards, Peter Kelly Senecal, Daniel Lee, and David Schmidt, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Initially a computational fluid dynamics consulting company, Convergent Science became a computational fluid dynamics computer software company in 2008 with the release of its CONVERGE CFD software. Convergent Science is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, with additional offices in the United States, Europe, and India. Additionally, Convergent Science is partnered with the Japan-based company IDAJ to distribute and support CONVERGE in Japan, Korea, and China.  Software  CONVERGE CFD software is a multi-purpose computational fluid dynamics code for modeling three-dimensional, reacting or non-reacting, turbulent flows. The software package includes coupled flow and detailed chemical kinetics solvers, the graphical user interface CONVERGE Studio, and a license for a limited version of the post-processing and visualization software Tecplot. CONVERGE features an automated meshing algorithm that generates an orthogonal mesh at runtime and employs Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) to refine the mesh during the simulation in areas with complex phenomena, like moving geometries or fluctuating temperatures or flow velocities. The company refers to this meshing process as ‚Äúautonomous meshing‚Äù. The modeling capabilities of CONVERGE include steady-state and transient simulations for incompressible or compressible flows. The software contains a variety of physical models for phenomena including turbulence, spray, conjugate heat transfer, multi-phase flow, fluid-structure interaction, and surface chemistry. CONVERGE has been applied for modeling internal combustion engines, fuel injectors, gas turbines, pumps, compressors, and engine aftertreatment systems. More than 700 peer-reviewed journal articles containing CONVERGE results have been published on these topics. Users of the software include automotive companies, the racing industry, universities, government, and corporate organizations. CONVERGE has been used in the development process for various high-profile projects, including Mazda's SKYACTIV-X, a highly efficient gasoline compression ignition engine, and Ford's EcoBlue diesel engine. Argonne National Laboratory, Caterpillar, and Cummins have employed CONVERGE in several projects aimed toward increasing the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines. In addition, Intel and Roush Yates Engines work with CONVERGE to design high-performance racing engines.

Releasing the first look of the film, Mohamed declares her \\"onscreen retirement\\" and indicates the film to be her last of a movie release though she would \\"still continue to serve in the industry behind camera\\". A thirty seconds teaser was released on 22 November 2017 which featured a demoralized Mohamed shattering a glass by continuously hitting on forehead. Mohamed had earlier worked with director Moomin Fuad in the segment \\"Baiveriyaa\\" from the unreleased anthology film, Hatharu Halha which is the first Maldivian anthology film project. It was earlier projected that filming will begin on 25 January 2018, although it was delayed, citing the need of \\"gaining weight to showcase the perfect physique the character\\" that Mohamed requires to portray. Filming commenced on 17 June 2018 at R. Inguraidhoo for a ten day schedule. All the indoor shots were completed during this schedule and filming for outdoor shots began on 11 July 2018 in Male'. An ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Aminath Rishfa, Zeenath Abbas, Ahmed Saeed, Nashidha Mohamed, Ahmed Azmeel, Mariyam Shakeela, Aminath Rasheedha and Mariyam Haleem were announced in a promotional event held on 10 April 2018. Soundtrack The first song of the film, \\"Reydhanve Mendhanve Dhandhen\\" which is sung by Mira Mohamed Majid and Falih Adam was released on 21 September 2018. Two promotional songs of the film were released prior to film release; Zoya's \\"Maa Rangalhu Vaaney\\" and Mira Mohamed Majid sung \\"Sihuru Fadhavi Kamana\\". The latter, directed and edited by Aishath Rishmy and Ravee Farooq was shot over eight days and was an instant hit upon release. Release The film was initially planned to release the film on Mohamed's birthday, 20 October 2018. However, the team later accelerated the release date to 19 October 2018 upon fan's request before pushing the project for an early 2019 release. On 27 September 2018, Mohamed confirmed that dubbing for the film is halted since she is suffering from laryngitis. Hence, the release date of the film was postponed to January 2019. Response Nivairoalhi received mostly positive reviews from critics. Aishath Maaha of Dho? favored the performance of the lead actors particularly praising Ahmed Asim's work to live his character. She also mentioned the \\"neat arrangement\\" of its screenplay though pointed out its \\"weak ending\\" to be unsatisfactory. Similar sentiments were echoed from Aminath Luba of Sun, where she picked Asim to be \\"outstanding\\" from the cast while others were thought to be \\"excellent\\". Luba also found the scene arrangement to be \\"gripping\\" while its ending to be \\"weak\\" considering the film as a whole.

In 1896, she moved to Denmark to continue her education, married a Dane and settled there. She published her literary works in both Finnish and Danish, introduced Danes to her native Finland through a series of lectures and established a Finnish Society in Copenhagen. She also created Finnish-Danish and Danish-Finnish dictionaries. In 1915, Moltensen was one of the founding members of Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de (Danish Women's Peace Chain), the Danish chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1918, representing Venstre, she was a candidate in the national elections but was not elected. Early life and education Born in Joroinen, Finland, Eva Elisabeth H√§llstr√∂m was the daughter of the pharmacist Frans Algoth H√§llstr√∂m (1835‚Äì1878) and Olga Elisabeth Hasintyt√§r Nyman (1843‚Äì1912). While still a small child, after losing both her father and her siblings, she moved with her mother to Helsinki where she attended the Swedish-language Latin School. After matriculating, she studied zoology at Helsinki University, graduating with a master's degree in 1894. In 1896, she received a scholarship which allowed her to continue her education in Denmark at Askov H√∏jskole, a folk high school. It was there she met her husband to be, the church historian Laust Jevsen Moltesen (1865‚Äì1950). They married in 1898 and their first child was born the following year. Professional life Although she adapted fully to the Danish way of life, she never forgot her native Finland, speaking to Danish women throughout the country about the way the Finns had been treated by the Russians. In 1904, she established the Finnish Society (Finske Forening) in Copenhagen. On the literary front, in 1905 after giving birth to her fourth and last child, she published Finnish- Danish and Danish-Finnish dictionaries and, in 1910, Fra Kalevalas lunde, a collection of stories from Finland's cultural heritage. Also in Danish, in 1920 she completed a short historical work in Danish titled Det finske Finland (The Finnish Finland). She also published works and articles about Denmark in Finnish. Together with Eline Hansen, Thora Daugaard, Louise Wright and Clara Tybjerg, in 1915 Moltesen was a co-founder of the Danish peace organization Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de. In 1918 and again in 1920, she was a Venstre candidate in the elections to the Folketing but was not elected. Moltensen was deeply distressed by her son Eric's death in 1926. The same year, her husband became foreign minister until 1929. Thereafter, she became increasingly weak, spending most of her time at home. She died in Gentofte on 10 November 1934 and is buried in Gentofte Cemetery.

She began writing poetry at a young age, publishing poems under the pseudonym Theone. Artner may have chosen her pseudonym based on the poem Teone by Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, who she cited as an early influence. During her lifetime, Artner's most successful works were her poems, published in three collections: Feldblumen auf Ungarns Fluren gesammelt von Minna und Theone (1800), Neuere Gedichte von Theone (1806), and Gedichte (1818). From 1814 to 1829, Artner would spend time each summer with friends Karoline Pichler, Marianne von Neumann Meissenthal, and Marie Gr√§fin von Zay to read and critique each other's writing. Artner wrote two poems about Pichler, \\"The Rescue\\" and \\"To Caroline Pichler,\\" while Pichler responded with the poem \\"To My Friend Theone.\\" In 1817, Artner wrote the drama Die That (The Deed), a tragedy in five acts which imagined the events taking place before the plot of Adolf M√ºllner's play Die Schuld.

It presents 6 cleansing methods, 84 asanas, 24 mudras and 8 kumbhakas. The text is illustrated in an 1830 manuscript with 84 paintings of asanas, prepared about a hundred years after the text. Topics The Joga Pradƒ´pikƒÅ covers a broad range of topics on yoga, including the nature of the yogic subtle body, preliminary purifications, yogic seals (mudrƒÅs), asanas, prƒÅnƒÅyƒÅma (breath-control), mantras, meditation, liberation (moksha), and samƒÅdhi. One of the purifications in the text is the mulashishnasodhana, \\"the cleansing of the anus and the penis\\", which calls for water to be drawn into the anus and squirted out through the penis, which James Mallinson and Mark Singleton gloss as \\"a feat which is, of course, anatomically impossible.\\" PrƒÅnƒÅyƒÅma is stated to result in liberation, on its own, though some of its breath-control techniques also use mantras. The Joga Pradƒ´pikƒÅ however asks the yogi to stay on as a physical body to serve the Lord, rather than choosing liberation. The Joga Pradƒ´pikƒÅ conflates the mudrƒÅs with asanas by describing the mahƒÅmudrƒÅ as one of its 84 asanas. Like other late texts, it describes a relatively large number of mudrƒÅs, 24 in all. On meditation, the text reworks the Bhagavata Purana's meditation of the goddess Sƒ´tƒÅ and the god RƒÅma. On samƒÅdhi, the yogi reaches it by the \\"bee cave\\" in the sahasrara chakra, the \\"thousand-petalled lotus\\", with an unending \\"unstruck sound\\". Asanas The description of 84 asanas occupies 314 out of 964 verses in the 1737 version. Most of the asanas are said to bring therapeutic benefits; all of them ask the practitioner to direct the gaze (drishti) at the point between the eyebrows or at the end of the nose. The 84 asanas described and illustrated in the 1830 document include some that are widely practised in modern yoga, but its selection differs markedly from that in other hatha yoga texts such as the Hatha Ratnavali. Many of the illustrated poses are seated asanas used for meditation, including the ancient Padmasana and Siddhasana, both of which appear twice in the set of illustrations. The number 84 is symbolic rather than literal, indicating that a set is complete and sacred.

Specific activities depended largely on the culture and social class, but some activities included horse back riding, dancing, tennis, and early versions of badminton.Verbrugge, Martha H. \\"Gender, Science & Fitness: Perspectives on Women's Exercise in the United States in the 20th Century.\\" Health and History 4, no. 1 (2002): 52-72. Social, commercial and scientific developments between 1900 and 1920 led to the increase of physical activities available to American women. Opportunities for women flourished as organized sports began to grow in popularity and physical education programs for girls were introduced in schools. One sport that was introduced in America at the turn of the century was basketball which quickly swept over schools and playgrounds across the nation. While initially men played the sport, it wasn't long before women too could be found playing basketball at parks, YWCA's, playgrounds, and in schools from kindergarten's through universities. However, women's basketball rules were different than men's due to fear that women may over exert themselves, or dislodge their uterus, if play became too intense. Another major achievement in the growing women's fitness movement, was when women first competed in the olympics. American physical educators, who were viewed as the experts on the topic at the time, strongly objected to women participating in the olympics. They claimed that it caused unnecessary physical strain and may create divisions among women. Despite this, after seeing what other women athletes were capable of doing, many women began to rethink their athletic limitations and capabilities.Laverie Vall√©e as Charmion One social and commercial development at the turn of the 20th century was the emergence of a group of female trapeze artists known as ‚Äústrong women‚Äù. They were at first criticized for opposing societal gender norms, but with the emergence of the cinema they soon became very popular icons for female health.Giles, Bieke. \\"Flying, Flirting, and Flexing: Charmion's Trapeze Act, Sexuality, and Physical Culture at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\\" Journal of Sports History 41, no. 2 (2014): 251-68 One famous trapeze artist of this time was Laverie Vall√©e, better known as Charmion. Her trapeze act was filmed and produced by Thomas Edison in 1901 and is known as the Trapeze Disrobing Act. The very popular 3 minute video shows Vall√©e swinging through the air, undressing herself while revealing a very muscular upper body.Trapeze Disrobing Act. Produced by Thomas Edison. Performed by Laverie Vall√©e. United States: Edison Company, 1901. https://www.loc.gov/item/96514756/. As more strong women like Vall√©e performed, their images were publicized through posters and postcards throughout the United States. These images challenged the aesthetic ideal of the female body. Scientific developments of the time were spearheaded by male physical educators whose work was focused on how to create the most efficient human body, both male and female.Vertinsky, Patricia. ‚ÄúWeighs and Means: Examining the Surveillance of Fat Bodies through Physical Education Practices in North America in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries.‚Äù Journal of Sport History, 35, no. 3 (2008): 449-468. Their focus was on the bodies weight and shape. Their research was focused on determining what the ideal, most efficient body would like. Dudley Sargent = Dudley Allen Sargent = One of the leading physical educators at the time was Dudley Allen Sargent, his research along with many others came to the conclusion that the ideal body was a slim one. Any unnecessary fat was inefficient. This idea spread quickly, and at the turn of the 20th century the ideal female figure was between 5‚Äô3‚Äô‚Äô and 5‚Äô7‚Äô‚Äô, and weighed between 125-140 lbs. Sargent advocated that the ideal female figure for young and developing girls is a boyish one. This kind of figure allowed girls to more easily participate in physical activities.Sargent, D.A. (Feb 1912). \\"How cam I have a graceful figure?\\". Ladies' Home Journal. 29, Iss. 2: 15‚Äì16 ‚Äì via Proquest. His critics often worried that the new female figure was becoming too masculine.\\"Modern Women Getting Nearer the Perfect Figure.\\" The New York Times (New York), December 4, 1910, 3rd ed. Accessed April 1, 2019. https://www.nytimes.com/1910/12/04/archives/modern-woman-getting-nearer-the- perfect-figure-dr-dudley-a-sargent.html. Sargent believed that more physical activity would actually lead to a more graceful female figure. He also believed that the corset exaggerated feminine features and took away from \\"true womanliness‚Äù. Sargent felt that true beauty lay in symmetry and the \\"natural development‚Äù of the female figure. A greater interest in knowing one's weight and where one ranked according to the norm set by the physical educators of the time emerged as a result. Anxiety over fat led to a cultural shift to control ones weight to conform with the norm.  1920 to 1940  alt= The 1920s was a progressive era for women's rights, with this came women's opposition to previous ideals of the \\"feminine body\\". The \\"New Woman's\\" (as they were frequently called) body was slender and boyish, contrasting the feminine curves of the 19th century woman. Clothing companies, food companies, and the media all promoted this new ideal of slimness and it spread quickly throughout society. Weight became a hot topic for public scrutiny as did private organizations effort to intervene and help people achieve the ideal body shape. Marion Talley in 1927 One example is an advertisement in the November 1936 edition of Life Magazine for the Ry-Krisp, a whole rye wafer. Displayed in the advertisement is a picture of a box of Ry-Krsips next to a bowl of fruit. The other pictures display two photos of Marion Talley, a famous singer, taken 10 years apart. The first picture is from 1926 and shows Talley as a pudgy 19 year old. The next picture is a full body shot of Talley in 1936, now weighing 107 pounds and looking younger than she did in 1926. The advertisement describes how Marion lost the weight exercising and eating Ry- Krisps as a bread substitute. The advertisement goes on to explain that Ry- Krisps are non-fattening food that can be used at any meal.‚ÄúTriumphant Talley‚Äù LIFE, November 30, 1936, 71. Eating disorders, particularly anorexia, spiked as women strived for slim bodies. Women also believed it was possible to become \\"too skinny\\" which was also not desirable. The slim figure was not only obtained through extreme eating habits, but basic at-home exercises were encouraged for women to maintain and develop trim figures. One popularly advertised method for losing weight was dancing to aerobic \\"reducing\\" records. Before and after pictures were included to show women the results they should expect. At this time, African American and White cultures were largely separated, but promotion of exercise, and the ideal of a slim body, were promoted in both cultures. In black culture, (similarly to white) women with healthy, fit bodies were associated with being patriotic, comely, trustworthy, and affluent. Exercise was promoted to lose weight and achieve these ideals.  1940 to 1960  Following WWII, some women returned to a life of domesticity, while others desired to continue working. Women became increasingly involved in sports and it wasn't long after the war that the first women's athletic revolution, which allowed more rights for women athletes and coaches, was created. For women not interested in joining sports teams, magazines continued to offer several articles full of advice for women on how to stay fit, including simple exercises, or popular fitness programs to join in on. Some articles capitalized on women's new-found independence, offering workout programs that would make them strong enough to help do \\"men's work\\" or hard labor in times of emergency, others offered after-hour fitness programs for working women, and some targeted the at-home mom and how she could fit fitness into her every day routine without spending a penny. During the late 40s special \\"exercise suits\\" that resembled swimwear of the time, even began to be offered for the everyday woman's fitness routines. Various means of aiding women in becoming slim were advertised in magazines. On January 8, 1940, Life Magazine wrote about a new phonographic record produced by RCA Records. The record contained 19 different exercises aimed at helping women fight ‚Äúa battle against growing curves.‚Äù‚ÄúNew Phonogrpah Records to Help Women in Their Fight Against Big Hips.‚Äù LIFE, January 8, 1940, 38-41. The exercises featured in the record were created by Wanda Bowman-Wilson, a female fitness trainer in New York. The exercises were specifically aimed at sliming the hips through various movements such as high kicks, lunges, and squats and the program promised to help remove inches of excess fat from the hip area. The November 4th, 1940 edition of Life Magazine included a small article about the MacLevy ‚ÄúSlenderizing Salons‚Äù. The article featured pictures of model, Pat Ogden on various reducing machines. The article displays pictures of Ogden and other women using the machines on their calves, thighs, ankles, stomach, back and hips to rub away the excess fat on their bodies.‚ÄúMachines Attack the Soild Flesh.‚Äù LIFE, November 4, 1940, 53-55. Good Housekeeping also included articles advising women on how to \\"change their shape\\". Articles covered exercises aiming to help women improve posture, slim their hips and trim their ankles while not thinning their faces, as well as expand their chest while shrinking their waist and arms. Diet was included in exercise suggestions and most exercises were merely simple stretches. The Ladies' Home Journal published an article in February 1941 about health and beauty from the perspective of Dr. T.A Pierson and his son Dr. J.R Pierson. In the article the two doctors offer advice to women on how to stay slim and encourage women to follow a simple \\"slimming diet‚Äù rather than fad diets. They suggest that it is better for women to be under weight than overweight. They also explain how one of the best exercises for a women are her household duties, and that besides those she doesn't need more exercise.  1960 to 1980  Jazzercise Class in 1983Exercise during the late 1960s aimed towards both maintaining a trim figure as well as increasing flexibility and overall well-being. Exercises were intended to tone legs, and strengthen the core and arms, while improving flexibility and grace. Some exercises included basic squats with knees together, ballet positions such as holding an arabesque, variations of sit- ups, and repetitions of leg raises. Fad diet pills became more accessible in the 1960s. In 1968 Life Magazine's cover story was on a diet pill scandal. The article highlights a growing group of \\"fat doctors‚Äù who treat \\"fat‚Äù women. These \\"fat doctors‚Äù prescribe a variety of pills aimed to help women lose weight. It became a scandal when an increasing number of women were dying due to an incorrect use of the pills. Life Magazine reporter Susan McBee went undercover for the article to learn more about the \\"fat doctors‚Äù and the practice of prescribing diet pills. Although McBee was far from overweight, she was 5'5‚Äù and weighed 125 pounds, each \\"fat doctor‚Äù she saw prescribed her diet pills to help her lose weight.\\"The End of the Rainbow May Be Tragic- Scandal of the Diet Pills.‚Äù LIFE, January 26, 1968, 23-28.Women participating in Aerobic Exercises With the passage of Title IX and a growing Feminist movement, women began to hold a more prominent role in exercise, specifically aerobics.Black, Jonathan. Making the American Body: The Remarkable Saga of the Men and Women Whose Feats, Feuds, and Passions Shaped Fitness History. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2013. Jacki Sorensen and Judi Missett were two women that came to the forefront of aerobic exercise in the 1970s and 80s. Both had been dancers and created exercise programs that combined aerobic exercise with dance. Jacki Sorensen founded Aerobic Dancing Inc. which began as a television program in 1969, and later became a book with audio and videocassette tapes. By 1981 there were four thousand and seventy Aerobics Instructors in forty-five states. Judi Missett started Jazzercise in 1969. She used VCR machines to sell her exercise dance routines to paid instructors across the country. She also wrote a very popular book called Jazzercise: A Fun Way to Fitness, in 1978. Throughout the 70's and 80's more aerobic fitness stars emerged such as Martha Rounds, Debbie Rosas, Nancy Strong, and Gilda Marx. They spread aerobic exercises like dance aerobics to women across the United States. In the early 1970s commercialized fitness programs continued to be popular. One boasted of results in only 3 days, through doing just 5 minutes of ab exercises a day. The before pictures portray a sad, pudgy woman, while the picture of 'after 14 days' pictures her with a very thin waist, toned arms, large bust, and a beaming smile.  1980 to 2000  During the 1980s, videocassetes were sold to let women exercise at home. One popular videotape exercise instructor was Jane Fonda. Most of her programs featured aerobics. Public television featured Body Electric, which was aerobics and muscle training. These broadcast instructions usually features instructions such as \\"don't forget to breathe\\" or \\"this part is great for the gluteis maximis\\". The exercises followed along with a hit popular songs. Soon there was a videocasseete for every type of exercise. Richard Simmons was popular because of having lost alarge amount of weight.

Early life and education  Johann Erhard Fischer was born in Hof to the shoemaker Georg Christian Fischer (1791 - 1872) and his wife Friederica Traugotte n√©e Matth√§us (1784 - 1834). He attended the Gymnasium in his hometown Hof until 1836.Jahres-Bericht von dem K√∂niglichen Gymnasium und der Lateinischen Schule zu Hof: im Studienjahre 1835/36 (1836).

As a student pastor he preached in Sachsgr√ºn under the direction of Pastor Johann Schott. Also during his time at the University he was closely acquainted with professor Karl von Raumer who was a mentor to both him and Wilhelm L√∂he. In September 1840 Fischer passed his Theology Examen with the score of \\"very close to very good\\" (German: sehr nahe an sehr gut). That same month he was assigned as a Pastoral Candidate in Schwarzenbach an der Saale under the direction of Pastor Johann Georg Renzel where he remained for a little over 3 years before he was finally ordained a pastor.

A year later he married Sophia Elisa Marianna Omeis (1827 - 1888), daughter of Rev. Johann Paul Omeis (1796 - 1870) and Marianna Regina n√©e Rupprecht (1797 - 1891). They married on 20 May 1845 in Henfenfeld where her father was the pastor.

In 1850, Fischer was a founding member, along with the co-founders Wilhelm L√∂he and Friedrich Wucherer of the Society of Inner (and later: Outer) Mission. Under the direction of L√∂he, the Society later became an influential force in American Lutheranism helping to found the Missouri and Iowa Synods along with numerous orphanages and educational institutions such as Wartburg College. During the 1840s and 1850s Reverend Fischer was a great helper of L√∂he's ecclesial and missionary works and was called L√∂he's brother-in-arms (Waffenbruder).Kraus, Emil.

Borrowing from the position of the freechurch in Breslau (Breslauer Freikirche, later known as the Lutheran Church in Prussia (lutherische Kirche in Preu√üen)), this view was challenged by Rev. Fischer and Wilhelm L√∂he in favor of a church free from government oversight. Claiming that this new oversight created a denomination that was neither Lutheran, Reformed, or Rationalist but simply Protestant, Fischer and L√∂he insisted that under this law, there was no longer a Lutheran church in Bavaria and that the Bavarian law must be challenged. Fischer and L√∂he were both signatories of a response consisting of six sentences that was signed in Schwabach on 9 Oct 1851 and published as Erkl√§rung mehrerer Geistlichen √ºber ihr Verh√§ltni√ü zur bayerisch- protestantischen Landeskirche. Eine Erwiederung der Culmbacher-Konferenz vom 23. September 1851. The signers in addition to Fischer were as follows: *Fr. Bauer, Cand. th. und Vorstand der Missionsanstalt in N√ºrnberg. *Fischer, Pfarrer in Aufse√ü. *Wilhelm L√∂he, Pfarrer zu Neuendettelsau. *G. J. R√∂del, Pfarrer zu Mengersdorf. *N. Semm, Pfarrer zu F√ºrth. *Volk, Pfarrer zu R√ºgland. *Wucherer, Pfarrer von Baldingen. In 1866 Fischer became the pastor at Theilenhofen. While at Theilenhofen, he became the general editor for Freimunds kirchlich-politisches Wochenblatt f√ºr Stadt und Land (from 1874 - 1884). Freimunds was a weekly newsletter founded by Reverend Johann Friedrich Wucherer. Wucherer was a long time friend and was also co-founder of the Society of Inner and Outer Mission (German: Gesellschaft f√ºr Innere und √Ñu√üere Mission im Sinne der Evangelisch-Lutherischen Kirche). Fischer's focus on the early church missionary efforts that had evangelize the Germanic tribes of his ancestors is attributed as a major influence on his grandson, the well-known linguist, explorer, and missionary Christian Gottlob Keyser who stayed with his Fischer grandparents in Theilenhofen when his father died in 1879. Keyser is well known for using some of these same missionary techniques advocated by his grandfather in evangelizing tribes in Papua New Guinea. Also coming to live with him part-time in his later days was his granddaughter Frieda (Keyser) Strehlow who also became a missionary to Australia and helped lower infant mortality and preserve aboriginal history and culture there. On 5 December 1884 Reverend Johann Erhard Fischer died in Theilenhofen and was buried in Theilenhofen on December 8.  Publications  Fischer also became a published historian. While a pastor at Artelshofen, Rev. Fischer wrote his three major historical works. The first work which he published in 1853 was a study of the missionary strategies of evangelization of the early Germanic tribes found in Swabia, Bavaria and Franconia. This work was entitled: Die Kraft des Evangeliums: mittheilungen aus der alteren Missionsgeschichte von Schwaben, Bayern und Franken. The next year (1854) Fischer published a local history related to his parish in Artelshofen and Altfalter which was a collection of cemetery records and old documents entitled: Die Kirchh√∂fe zu Artelshofen und Altfalter: geschichtliche Nachrichten nebst einer Einweihungsrede aus dem Jahre 1754, zun√§chst den beiden Gemeinden zur Erinnerung mitgetheilt ; zum Besten bedr√§ngter und verfolgter Lutheraner (1854). Lastly, Fischer wrote a history of how Christianity was introduced into what was then the Kingdom of Bavaria. This book was published in 1863 as Die Einf√ºhrung des Christenthums im jetzigen K√∂nigreiche Bayern : ein geschichtlicher Versuch zun√§chst f√ºr Missionsfreunde. Besides these published books he also acquired and contributed historical artifacts to the German Museum and articles to historical organizations. One such article he wrote concerns the altar painting in the church in Artelshofen painted in 1518.Anzeiger f√ºr Kunde der deutschen Vorzeit: Organ d. Germanischen Museums, Volume 5 by the Germanisches Museum in 1858, pp. 179-180 He also published two articles: Notizen zur Geschichte der Pfarreiein Artelshofen und Alfalter and Der Sturm auf Enzendorf 1504, for the Middle Franconia Historical Society in 1853. Rev. Fischer was asked to be the main speaker at the Missionsfest in M√ºnchberg on 27 Jul 1859. His sermon was taken from Isaiah 9:2-7. His sermon was well received and subsequently published in a collection of popular sermons entitled Casual-Reden: eine Sammlung kirchlicher Reden f√ºr besondere Amtsf√§lle.Junge, Casual-Reden: eine Sammlung kirchlicher Reden f√ºr besondere Amtsf√§lle, Missions-Predigt Isaiah (Jesaja) 9:2-7. 1871. p.538ff. =List of Works= Books: *Die Kraft des Evangeliums: mittheilungen aus der alteren Missionsgeschichte von Schwaben, Bayern und Franken (1853). *Die Kirchh√∂fe zu Artelshofen und Altfalter: geschichtliche Nachrichten nebst einer Einweihungsrede aus dem Jahre 1754, zun√§chst den beiden Gemeinden zur Erinnerung mitgetheilt ; zum Besten bedr√§ngter und verfolgter Lutheraner (1854). *Die Einf√ºhrung des Christenthums im jetzigen K√∂nigreiche Bayern : ein geschichtlicher Versuch zun√§chst f√ºr Missionsfreunde (1863).

People suffering from depression have a tendency towards unhelpful abstract thinking and negative thoughts, such as viewing a single mistake as evidence that they are useless at everything. As such, CNT involves switching cognitive focus from negative thoughts to positive thoughts so as to cut down on rumination‚Äîfocused attention on the symptoms of one's distress‚Äîand self-criticism, which can cause feelings of inadequacy and raise anxiety. This technique was developed at the University of Exeter, located in Exeter, England, by Professor Edward Watkins and his team of researchers after they conducted a study to see if the CNT approach could reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the 2009 study, twenty-one men and thirty-nine women were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first group received CNT, the second group received bogus concreteness training (BGT), and the third group was a wait-list (WL) control condition that received no treatment. The concreteness training involved practicing thinking about the specific details of recent mild negative events: how the event happened, where it happened, who was there, what they did. The goal was to try to get a mental picture of the event, its circumstances, and then focus on the sequence of how it happened. Participants received the specific treatment every day for a week based on their assigned group. At the end of the week, participants were again assessed for depression levels and symptoms. Results indicated that CNT showed a trend toward a greater decrease in depressive symptoms than BGT or WL. Accordingly, Professor Watkins noted: ‚ÄúThis is the first demonstration that just targeting thinking style can be an effective means of tackling depression. Concreteness training can be delivered with minimal face-to-face contact with a therapist and training could be accessed online, through CDs or through smartphone apps. This has the advantage of making it a relatively cheap form of treatment.‚Äù However, in a study published by Springer Nature in 2013, it was concluded that the effectiveness of CNT may be limited, claiming that while concreteness of thinking increased, results did not support that CNT was effective \\"as a standalone treatment for depression\\". In addition, contrary to previous findings, the study also did not find a significant effect on rumination. The potential reasoning behind this lack of effect was \\"because the sample did not exhibit a significant decrease in depression\\". Yet, CNT has been proven to be effective when delivered in a specific manner, like therapeutic context, with the rationale that the participant knows he or she is being treated for depressive symptoms by a credible authority. Moreover, results have also demonstrated that CNT is a valid technique in the reduction of self-criticism, especially where the use of self-relevant events (autobiographical materials) has been prevalent.

His institutional career ended with his office presiding over the Council of State in Francoist Spain.  Biography  Born on 21 September 1875 in Madrid. He moved to Sig√ºenza when he was eight, and, later to C√°ceres, where he took the latest years of his high school education passing the Baccalaureate. He started his university studies in Law at the Central University of Madrid, graduating at the University of Valladolid; he obtained a PhD in the same area at the Central University. He was employed by the Audience of Seville from 1902 to 1905, when he returned to Valladolid to work in the later city audience. He became a lawyer in 1908, and, in 1912, he obtained the chair of Natural Law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Valladolid. From 1925 to 1930 he served as Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship. The attempted enactment of the article 53 of the Law of University Reform promoted by Callejo in 1928, equating the private education (augustinian and jesuit religious institutions in particular) with the public education for the purposes of the issuance of academic degrees generated a wave of unrest and protests among the students. In 1930, soon after the end of the Primo de Rivera government, he joined the National Monarchist Union along other nostalgics for the regime such as Jos√© Calvo Sotelo, Ramiro de Maeztu or the son of the dictator Jos√© Antonio. After the onset of the Spanish State he was designated member of the Cortes Espa√±olas in 1943. In 1945 he was appointed as President of the Council of State, serving until his death on 21 January 1950 in Madrid.

After education at Merchant Venturers' School, Henry Devine studied medicine at University College, Bristol and at Bristol General Hospital, qualifying MB in 1902. After serving as a house physician at Bristol General Hospital, he studied medicine at King's College, London, where he received the degree MB BS (Lond.) in 1905. After a postgraduate educational visit to Kraepelin's clinic in Munich, he successively held junior appointments in England at London's Mount Vernon Hospital for Consumption, at Wakefield's West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, and at South West London's Chelsea Hospital for Women. He then entered the London County Council's mental hospital service. After briefly serving at Cane Hill Asylum, he was appointed in 1907 assistant medical officer at Epsom's Long Grove Asylum. Devine joined in 1905 the Association of Medical Officers of Asylums and Hospitals for the Insane and was awarded in 1909 the Association's Gaskell prize (¬£45) and gold medal. In July 1909 he was awarded the MD degree of the University of London in the division of psychiatry. From Long Grove Asylum he went as senior medical officer to the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum and then became medical superintendent of the Portsmouth Mental Hospital (in 1937 renamed St. James' Hospital). Devine was in command there during WWI and for his wartime services he was made OBE in 1919. He was appointed consulting physician to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. In 1919 he was elected FRCP. In 1920 Devine was a member of the editorial committee of the newly founded Journal of Neurology and Psychopathology. On the editorial staff of the Journal of Mental Science he was an assistant editor from 1916 to 1920 and a co-editor from 1920 to 1927. In 1929 he published a volume on Recent Advances in Psychiatry.

Their mission statement is ‚Äúenriching lives through world-class theatre.‚Äù In 1985, Ruth and Nathan Hale partnered with their daughter, Sally Hale Rice, and their oldest grandson, Mark Dietlein and his wife (also Sally) to start a theatre in Utah. They converted an old lingerie factory in South Salt Lake to a theatre- in-the-round with 220 seats. After a couple of expansions, they moved into a new, magical facility in West Valley City in 1998. After selling out all 613 seats at Harman Hall on a regular basis, a new partnership was formed with Sandy City in 2017 as they opened the new home of Hale Centre Theatre at the Mountain America Performing Arts Centre. Hale Centre Theatre provides traditional play and musical theatre productions on two state-of-the-art stages under one roof in Sandy City. The smaller Sorenson Legacy Jewel Box Stage seats 467 people; the larger Young Living Centre Stage seats 911. The Theatre has a total of 130,000 square feet and is the only professional theatre venue between Salt Lake City, a half hour to the north, and St. George, four hours to the south. It is considered to be a cultural highlight of downtown Sandy. Hale Center Theatre provides learning opportunities for students and individuals interested in a career in acting, production, lighting, sound, and composition. One way they give back to the community is by providing complimentary tickets to area schools around Utah to promote wholesome, exceptional theatre experiences for the rising generation. The success of this outreach has earned Hale Centre Theatre a loyal fan base of people of all ages.  Theatre in Utah  Theatre came to Utah with pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when they entered the Utah valley in the late 1840s after fleeing persecution in Nauvoo, Illinois Theatre was an important form of entertainment to the Latter-day Saints. Church president, Brigham Young, ‚Äúbelieved the people of Utah needed a theatre before they needed a temple.‚Äù The first theatre company in Utah, the Musical and Dramatic Company, opened in 1850. It was composed of local members of the Church, including affiliates with the Nauvoo Brass Band, which became the company‚Äôs orchestra.Wintch, Lucille R. \\"The Theatre-Its Growth in Utah.\\" Research paper, Brigham Young University, 1963:1-10. Attending the theatre as a form of entertainment grew rapidly in popularity among the locals because the community was isolated. Other touring theatre companies in the United States did not go as far West as Salt Lake, so the locals had to entertain themselves. However, the majority of Mormon pioneers came from overseas, particularly England, and had a great love for drama already. They attended and performed in productions enthusiastically. In 1851, the Musical and Dramatic Company was reorganized as the Deseret Dramatic Association. The Social Hall was built in 1853 to house performances of the Association and became known as the first Little Theatre in America.Engar, Ann W. \\"Theater in Utah,\\" In Utah History Encyclopedia. University of Utah Press, 1994: 551-553. Other \\"Social Halls\\" appeared throughout Utah, particularly in Mt. Pleasant, Provo, Nephi, and Cedar City. Theatre was put on pause in Utah following the outbreak of the Utah War in 1857. Once the crisis settled, the Mechanics‚Äô Dramatic Association was formed in 1859. Plays for this Association were performed in the home of Harry Bowring and was called Bowring‚Äôs Theatre. Salt Lake Theatre Circa 1861-1870 The Salt Lake Theatre was built in March 1862 as a first-class theatre for Salt Lake patrons. The Social Hall could no longer hold the large numbers of patrons who wanted to attend theatre productions, making the theatre's construction a necessity. More than 1,500 people gathered for the dedication and it became known as the ‚ÄúCathedral of the Desert.\\" It was torn down in 1929. The completion of the transcontinental railroad enabled performers to travel across the nation. The transcontinental railroad was completed in the late 1860s, opening travel for traveling companies from the East to come to Utah. The fame of the talent and quality of Utah performances had spread, and great actors came to participate. By the 1890s, theater in Utah was very popular. Large newspapers such as the Deseret News, Salt Lake Tribune, and Salt Lake Herald dedicated special pages to Utah‚Äôs professional theatres. Dramatic companies began to fade with the arrival of film in the 1900s. Utah universities and colleges then began their own theatre programs, including the University of Utah, Brigham Young University, and Southern Utah University. Hale Center Theatre continues to give public access to the performing arts. Its newest location is the Mountain America Performing Arts Centre in Sandy. It opened November 16, 2017 with a production of Aida. Many of those who donated to build the theatre were in attendance as well as state officials, including Sandy Mayor, Tom Dolan and Utah Governor, Gary Herbert.  Ruth and Nathan Hale  Ruth and Nathan Hale were drawn into the world of theatre because they were asked to be drama leaders in their Mormon congregation in Granger, Utah. They decided to write their own plays because they did not have the money to pay for the royalties on existing ones. Their plays gained popularity and soon they were performed in other Mormon congregations. Eventually, the Hales were invited to perform one of their plays at Brigham Young University. The evening of their first performance they received thirteen curtain calls.Hale, Ruth. \\"A Candid Look at Herself.\\" Interviewed by Women's History Archives Symposium at Brigham Young University. February 8, 1978. 6. During World War II, the Hales decided to move to California to find better work opportunities. Nathan Hale tried to find work at the Pasadena Playhouse, but the Playhouse only accepted actors and actresses from nearby studios and ones the company had worked with previously. The Hales went back to performing their plays for local Mormon congregations until Nathan was scouted by a talent agent.Hale, Ruth. \\"A Candid Look at Herself.\\" 8. When Nathan‚Äôs opportunity fell through, the Hales decided to start their own theatre in Glendale, California. They called it the Glendale Center. It was a small theatre which only seated a hundred and ten people, but its popularity quickly grew. Eventually, the Hales decided to go back to Granger and build another theatre by selling land left to Ruth Hale by her father and with financial assistance from their daughter and son-in-law.Hale, Ruth. \\"A Candid Look at Herself.\\" 10. Theatre became a family business for the Hales. The Hales' descendants are still in the theatre business today, running the theatres and upholding the family legacy.  Theatre Across the Nation  A key component of understanding American theatre is the mid-twentieth century theatre movement in London that highlighted the rise of small, local theatres who were not interested in competing directly with the monopoly-like position of the West End. As these local theatres became more prevalent, they enveloped parts of local characteristics such as a region‚Äôs dialect or the character Paddy with his pet pig as a representation of the Irish. The history of American theatre closely follows the ties to Britain. The large scale national movement in America began in 1915 when the future Theatre Guild was established in Washington D.C. Increased transportation between the British Isles and America led to more British actors in star roles in America which established cities like New York as one of the theatrical capitals of the world. With the increase in wealth generated from play production, local theatres across the nation, especially around the west coast, were able to produce their own shows in order to reach a greater audience. Photographs of The Metropolitan (above) and the California Theatre (below) located in San Francisco, California. Building off the success of the first main theatres in the Salt Lake valley, Utah has held a prominent position in local drama in the West where some of the most well-known actors and actresses of the late 19th and early 20th century performed like Edwin Adams, Joseph Jefferson, and Julia Dean Hayne (one of the local audience‚Äôs favorites). It was joined in the rise of local theatres in cities such as San Francisco‚Äôs The Metropolitan in 1853 and the California Theatre in 1869. The mid-1960s was a time that saw theatre move away from the classical repertoire and seek for new ways in which to attract patrons and energize local companies. The way to compete with large- scale theatre companies and the bright light prominence of Broadway was to perform a new style of play, one that would have historical importance. The play which popularized regional theatre was The Great White Hope by Howard Sackler. After the success of The Great White Hope in Washington where it premiered, and on Broadway, the 1969-1970 theatre season saw a large increase in the percentage of new plays being performed; 15% of total performances as opposed to only 5% a few seasons before. = Introduction of the theatre-in- the-round = The early history of the theatre-in-the-round is hard to pinpoint with complete accuracy because not many sources exist. From what can be understood, the roots of this type of theatre come from an early, primitive time before language existed. It established a foundation within society as the development of speech, acting and expression came about in places such as Ancient Greece, Rome and Europe. There are many different kinds of plays that can be performed on a theatre-in-the-round, from Elizabethan style like William Shakespeare to the musical style. Different styles would require certain adjustments in order to use the space most effectively. In addition to re-productions, there are many new plays that were written specifically to be enacted in a space such as a theatre-in-the-round. The term ‚Äútheatre-in-the- round‚Äù is a term that generally means a space where the audience surrounds the stage in some manner, although some other synonyms include arena theatre, central staging, island staging and ring theatre. The stage can be any size or shape. Acting is a social equation with only two essential components: actors who start the drama and the audience who receives it. In order to make the theatre-going experience more meaningful, not just to the younger generation but to the adults as well, there was a need to reconsider the ingredients of the industry and move away from the big lights and stages. Placing the audience around the story of the production not only increases the intimacy of the performance but also helps the audience feel more invested and involved in the outcome. = Impact of Musical Theatre = Musical composers Richard Rodgers (left sitting at piano) and Oscar Hammerstein II (right) who produced some of the greatest musical theatre of the 20th century. Hale Center Theatre has performed many of their shows over ten times. The Hale Center Theatre produces many types of performances each season including revivals of famous or local favorites and providing a mix of musical with traditional theatre. With their new, state-of-the-art facility housing two theatre spaces, there is more capacity to include more 'popular' styles in their repertoire, especially ones that have greater uses for lighting, videos and pre-existing mediums outside the theatre. This has appealed to younger audiences and has continued a 200 year tradition of American musical theatre as a mix of traditional drama and modern music. Examples of these performances include Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat (performed in 2017), The Scarlet Pimpernel Musical (2018) and The Heart of Robin Hood (2017). With increased performances accompanying greater demand, more expansive advertising methods have been used to maintain and grow the company's local presence including press, media and print coverage on new buildings, partnerships with local companies and businesses, and promotions to schools and students.  Locations  The legacy of Ruth and Nathan Hale is continued through the management of several other locations outside of Sandy, Utah by their children and grandchildren. These theatres are independently owned and autonomous from each other. These theatres bring quality performances to the local populations of Gilbert, Arizona, Orem, Utah and Glendale, California.

Critical reception MTV called \\"More Than That\\" a \\"hypnotic\\" and \\"sultry number that finds her cooly asserting her dominance\\". Idolator wrote that the \\"darkly seductive banger\\" showcases Jauregui's \\"full potential\\" and praised the \\"beguiling\\" production. Uproxx called the song a \\"first-class banger\\" and \\"an excellent showcase\\" of Jauregui's \\"smoky, sonorous voice\\". Earmilk complimented the production, and wrote that Jauregui \\"sets the bar high\\" with the song \\"packed to the rim with attitude, including ample bark to match her bite\\". Paper praised Jauregui's songwriting and her \\"gorgeous raspy howl\\" in the song. Rolling Stone considered it an \\"intoxicating\\" and \\"flossy\\" record in which Jauregui \\"asserts her independence and worth\\". Music video The music video was released on January 18, 2019. It was directed by Lauren Dunn and creatively directed and co-edited by Jauregui, who also cast the dancers. Inspired by the Greek goddess Aphrodite, Jauregui described her concept as \\"Aphrodite's visit to Earth\\" while she \\"finds herself in a unique club surrounded by the earthly embodiments of the divine feminine\\". The video is also partly inspired by Sandro Botticelli's renaissance painting Primavera, in which the Roman goddess Venus stands among three women dancing around her. In the video, Jauregui's Aphrodite and three other women drive to an all-female nightclub called Olympus, where they join the female crowd admiring a group of exotic dancers performing in front of them. Jauregui is later invited by a dancer to the stage. The single's cover art, a recreation of the painting The Birth of Venus, was brought to life in the video. Aphrodite \\"is the ultimate celebration of femininity and beauty and sexuality in an empowering way\\", Dunn said. \\"When we think of a strip club, it's often darkly lit and seedy and secretive and you don't tell people you're going. It's not a place you envision women getting together and going to celebrate other women.\\" Jauregui explained that it is \\"about taking that kind of rap video imagery and empowering the women who do this work ‚Ä¶ each woman's spirit is captured in a way that's revering her strength and her sensuality.\\" Jauregui said that the dancers are the \\"centerpiece\\" of the video for her. Dunn described the video as \\"a celebration of women's power and beauty, in every form. Every body type, every color.\\" The wardrobe of Jauregui and the women alongside her references the garment worn by the women in the Primavera painting. Stylist Mimi Cuttrell said that the wardrobe is a \\"take on old Greek mythology and ethereal goddess vibes, but it was important to us that we had a [Jauregui] spin on it all.\\" The visual design of the video takes cues from the world of Aphrodite, including the lighting, production design, and cinematography. The video also integrates some visual references from Jauregui's previous video for \\"Expectations\\", such as doves and roses, symbols that are associated with Aphrodite. Vogue described the video as \\"hypnotic\\", \\"fashion-forward\\", and \\"subversive\\". Uproxx wrote that the video is as \\"enticing\\" as the \\"provocative\\" song. Hayden Brooks of iHeart Radio said that the video continues Jauregui's \\"drastic departure from her Fifth Harmony past\\" and praised Jauregui's performance. MTV called the video \\"entrancing\\" with \\"compelling visuals\\", and deemed Jauregui's \\"awesome attention to detail\\" a \\"testament to how stunningly Jauregui is navigating her debut solo era.\\" Charts { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2019) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)  27 - ! scope=\\"row\\"Portugal Digital Song Sales (RIAA) 9 } References Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Lauren Jauregui songs Category:Songs written by Lauren Jauregui Category:Song recordings produced by Murda Beatz ","title":"More Than That (Lauren Jauregui song)"},{"id":"59610680","title":"Nights Like This (Kehlani song)"},{"id":"59610734","text":"Al Washington (born April 22, 1984) is an American football coach and former player who is currently a Linebackers coach for The Ohio State Buckeyes football team.

History The road from Fairview north to Milburn was added to the state route system in 1912 as part of SR-32, and in 1926 it became part of the original alignment of US-89. US-89 was moved to bypass Milburn in 1937, and the old route between Fairview and Milburn was transferred to SR-91. The routes remained in this configuration until 1969, when SR-91 was removed from the state highway system in a mass deletion of minor state highways and transferred to local jurisdiction. However, the short segment of former SR-91 between US-89 and SR-31 in Fairview continued to be used as the primary connection from northbound US-89 to eastbound SR-31, and vice versa.

Williamson's bid for the Democratic nomination was her second political campaign, after previously running as an independent to represent California's 33rd congressional district in 2014. Prior to her candidacy, Williamson was known as \\"Oprah's spiritual adviser\\" due to her frequent appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Williamson described herself as a \\"pretty straight-line progressive democrat\\". Her policy positions include $100 billion in reparations for slavery, a \\"Medicare for All model\\" for healthcare, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants without a \\"serious criminal background\\", establishing a \\"Department of Peace\\" to greatly expand the use of diplomacy and mediation, and support for the Green New Deal. On January 10, 2020, Williamson announced she had ended her presidential campaign. She pledged to support the eventual Democratic nominee, but later announced her endorsement for Bernie Sanders at a February 23 rally in Austin, Texas. Background On August 2, 2018, The Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs revealed that Marianne Williamson, a New Age author and spiritual leader known as \\"Oprah's spiritual adviser\\" thanks to her frequent appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show, was considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. He reported that she had visited Iowa earlier that week, appearing at the Des Moines area as well as Fairfield, a cultural magnet for practitioners of the Transcendental Meditation technique and where the Maharishi University of Management is based. Williamson had previously contested California's 33rd congressional district in the 2014 elections as a no party preference candidate, securing 13% of the vote in the state's top-two primary after self-funding $2 million in a campaign supported by Alanis Morissette and Dennis Kucinich. She made several more visits to Iowa in September and October, stopping in Sioux City and Polk City, in addition to returning to Fairfield for small events with fans and local Democrats. Campaign Williamson campaigning in New Hampshire Williamson supporters in Detroit ahead of the July debate On November 15, 2018, Williamson announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee in a video in which she acclaimed that there was a \\"miracle in this country in 1776 and we need another one,\\" requiring \\"a co-creative effort, an effort of love and a gift of love, to our country and hopefully to our world.\\" Visiting New Hampshire in early January, she said that she had \\"received enough positive energy to make me feel I should take the next step,\\" and subsequently hired Brent Roske to lead her operation in Iowa. Roske, a film producer who had also contested the same 2014 primary for the seat as Williamson now represented by Ted Lieu, maintained a wide network of connections in Iowa due in part to his previous involvement in the state, working on a political television show about the 2016 caucuses. In response to the Iowa Democratic Party's proposed creation of \\"virtual caucuses\\" in the 2020 race, Williamson's campaign announced that it would appoint 99 \\"Virtual Iowa Caucus Captains\\" (each assigned to a single county) to turn out supporters in both the virtual and in-person caucuses. Williamson officially launched her presidential campaign in Los Angeles on January 28, 2019, in front of an audience of 2,000 attendees. She appointed Maurice Daniel, who had served alongside Donna Brazile in Dick Gephardt's campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1988, as her national campaign manager, with her campaign committee, \\"Marianne Williamson for President,\\" officially filed on February 4. Following her Los Angeles announcement, she held her Iowa kickoff in Des Moines on January 31. On February 16, in addition to scheduling another trip to New Hampshire, Williamson's campaign announced the appointment of former Congressman Paul Hodes, who had represented New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district from 2007 to 2011, as New Hampshire state director and senior campaign advisor. Former Georgia state assemblywoman Gloria Bromell Tinubu, who had returned to South Carolina in 2011 to run for Congress in the state's 7th district, and later joined Phil Noble's bid for governor in 2018 as his running mate, served as South Carolina state director and national senior advisor to the Williamson campaign. She later ceased working with the campaign. On May 9, Williamson's campaign announced that she had received enough contributions from unique donors to enter the official primary debates, having raised $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2019, during which the campaign received donations from 46,663 unique individuals. She subsequently met the polling criteria, with three unique polls at 1% from qualifying pollsters, on May 23. In June, Williamson confirmed that she had moved to Des Moines, Iowa in advance of the 2020 caucuses. Williamson's performance in the first debate, during which she said her \\"first call [as President] is to the prime minister of New Zealand,\\" and that she would \\"harness love for political purposes\\" against Donald Trump, made her the subject of many Internet memes, and also led Republicans including Ted Cruz strategist Jeff Roe to call for donations to her campaign, to keep her on the debate stage for future debates. Williamson subsequently drew praise for challenging libertarianism on The Rubin Report. Her campaign was noted for receiving 70% of its funding from women. This was 13% higher than that of Julian Castro, the candidate with the next highest fraction of female support. On January 2, 2020, Williamson laid off her entire campaign staff, with media speculating on her possible withdrawal, though one of her former staffers said that \\"...she plans to continue.\\" She formally ended her campaign on January 10. She said, \\"To the remaining Democratic candidates, I wish you all my best on the road ahead. It was an honor being among you. Whichever one of you wins the nomination, I will be there with all my energy and in full support.\\" On February 23, 2020, Williamson appeared at a campaign rally in Austin, Texas for US Senator Bernie Sanders and officially announced her endorsement. Policies Williamson has described herself as a \\"pretty straight-line progressive democrat,\\" supporting an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, reducing wealth inequality, addressing climate change, and tackling student loan debt. She backs a \\"Medicare for All model\\", Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants without a \\"serious criminal background,\\" and stated that the U.S. needs to be an \\"honest broker\\" in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. One of her principal plans is the establishment of a Department of Peace to greatly expand the use of diplomacy, mediation, and educational and economic development. She also voices support for the Green New Deal, stricter gun control, criminal justice reform, improving public education, free college tuition, and raising the top marginal tax rate to a point where high earners pay \\"their fair share of taxes.\\" She has described her policies as a \\"renovation\\" of a \\"sociopathic economic system\\" focused on \\"short-term profit maximization.\\" Her signature campaign promise is a call for $100 billion in reparations for slavery to be distributed over 10 years by a group of black leaders for selected \\"economic and education projects,\\" and later suggested distributing $200 to $500 billion on The Breakfast Club, a sum far greater than any other primary contenders support. In doing so, Williamson became the only candidate in the Democratic field to submit a detailed plan for reparations for black Americans, though fellow Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Beto O‚ÄôRourke later pledged support for reparations in late February 2019.

The series began streaming on the video on-demand service Shudder on November 15, 2018, and premiered at Fantastic Fest earlier that year on September 23. It stars Hannah Gross as a young woman who is hired to track down a rare vinyl record rumored to have the capability of killing those who listen to it. The show's title refers to the space between a record label and the final track, where no audio can be recorded. Synopsis Note - the synopsis is told in chronological rather than episodic order. During one of his shows, young college DJ Tuck Weston informs a listener that his radio station used to own a strange record - the Lytton lacquer - created by renowned sound engineer Lyle M. Lytton, who died during the making of the record. As such, the record captured the sound of Lytton transcending to the next plane of existence, the sound of death itself. Listening to the record in its totality has the capability of killing those who hear it; however the listener jokes that listening to it backwards may be a cure. After the show a strange woman (revealed as Lily Child in later episodes) invites him to listen to the record on behalf of a collector she refers to only as 'null and void'. Unable to resist, Tuck meets Lily and listens to a split second of the record. Later describing the sound as the sound of 'null and void', Tuck is driven insane by strange phenomena. Many years later, an elderly man listens to the Lytton lacquer and is found dead the following day, mummified. The record is taken into evidence by Len, who listens to a portion of the record before bagging it as evidence. His decision is later ridiculed by his co-worker Daryl, who believes the record to have no relevance to the man's death. After being sent off for coffee, Len begins to experience the same phenomena as Tuck and passes out. When he wakes, he discovers that Daryl has been killed in an extremely gruesome fashion. Len is questioned by Detective Kenny Rhodes, who later lets him go after viewing the building's security tapes. Meanwhile, record finder Etta is informed by one of her clients about a rare grouping of records created by Lytton, three Key records and the Lytton lacquer. If played simultaneously, the Key records are said to produce sounds that have previously gone unheard by any living person. These records can be identified via strange markings etched into the wax located on the deadwax - the space between the grooves and the label. Intrigued, Etta begins investigating despite misgivings by her girlfriend Lana and her mentor Ian warning her that the record will be nearly impossible to locate and that even listening to a portion of the record drives a person insane. Her investigation leads her to Len, revealed to be Etta's former lover. She agrees to stay over at his house, as he is clearly distraught by his experiences, and that night Etta watches Len undergo inexplicable supernatural phenomena. The two travel to meet Tuck, now much older and living in a secluded cabin in the woods. They question him over the Lytton lacquer and ask him if he owns a Key record, which enrages him and prompts him to chase them out of the cabin. Tuck follows after them and is killed by Len via a rock to the head. Afterwards, the two discover a hidden briefcase that contains a notebook with markings that lead them to Lily Child. Lana is able to produce an address for Lily; however when Etta goes to consult Ian, she discovers gruesome remains everywhere and assumes that he died in the same manner as Len's partner. After arriving at her address, Lily details her family's past running a company that tends lac insects that produce lacquer that can make records of superior quality. She notes that they never had a chance to refine the process, so synthetic products became more popular. Lily apologizes for what Len is going through and states that the Lytton lacquer was never meant to be listened to by itself and that its true purpose has been ignored. She takes Etta and Len to a room where they are prompted to listen to the Key records on perfectly tuned record players and remain in a circle in the center of the players, noted to be the best place to listen. Once they start to experience strange phenomena, they panic, leave the circle, and unsuccessfully try to stop the music before passing out. After passing out, it's revealed that Ian did not die and that he is in league with Lily. Etta wakes later and finds that she has been restrained. Looking over, she sees a restrained Len be devoured alive by carnivorous lac insects. She passes out again but wakes to find Ian, who says that Len's death made it possible for the insects to become perfectly tuned and produce quality lacquer and that they will retune the world together before drugging her into unconsciousness. She's discovered by Detective Rhodes, who followed her there, only to watch Lily murder him. Etta escapes after killing Lily, but is contacted by Ian, who tells her that she is out of tune with the world and that once she hears the Lytton lacquer, she will understand his actions. He also implies that Lana has listened to the Lytton lacquer without first listening to the Key records, which would kill her. Etta returns home to discover the Lytton lacquer on her record player. Lana is shown in the background, but it is never clarified whether she listened to the lacquer or not, as her body is never clearly seen. Etta places the record on the turntable and briefly hesitates, leaving it up to the viewer if she will listen to the record or not.

Writer and director Graham Reznick was also interested with the impact sound design could have on viewers, as it allows him to alter their perception without having to give visual story clues. Reznick has stated that if the series is continued, he has plans on how to expand the story universe. Reception /Film reviewed Deadwax, praising the sound and visuals while criticizing what they saw as a \\"lack of engaging character development\\". Character development was also noted in a video review by Bleeding Cool, whose reviewer noted that Etta was a \\"generic ye olde grizzled detective that we've seen a hundred thousand times before\\" and that while they liked the premise of the series and the actress, the character needed to be rounded out more. A review by Bloody Disgusting for the first four episodes of the series was more positive, as they felt that the characters were developed enough for viewers to care about them and that the series' story and visuals thus far were well done.

It is native to Florida and Georgia in the United States. William Bartram, the American naturalist who first formally described the species using the basionym Annona pygmaea, named it after its dwarfed ( in Latin) stature. Description It is a bush reaching 20-30 centimeters in height. It has a spindle-shaped taproot from which one or more branched, or unbranched shoots emerge. Its shoots have red to brown bark with lenticels. Its leathery leaves are 4-11 centimeters long and have rounded or blunt tips, occasionally with a notch. The margins of the leaves are rolled toward their underside. The leaves are dark green and hairless on their upper surface and paler on their underside with a networked pattern of veins. Its twisted petioles are 3-10 millimeters long. Its flowers are on thin, 1.5-4 centimeter long axillary peduncles. Its flowers are a brown-crimson color with a strong yeasty or rotting flesh smell. Its flowers have 6 petals, arranged in two rows of three. Its oblong to oval, fleshy, outer petals are 1.5-3 centimeters long and rolled downward toward their outer surface. Its fleshy, oval inner petals are 0.5-2 centimeters long, deeper in color than the outer petals. The base of the inner petals are swollen, and wrinkled on the inner surface. The tips of the inner petals are rolled back. The stamens are globular, 4-7 millimeters wide and light green to pink at maturity. Its flowers have 2-5 carpels. Its fruit are yellow-green, curved cylinders, 3-4 centimeters in length. The fruit have brown, shiny seeds, each 1 centimeter in length, arranged in two rows. =Reproductive biology= The pollen of Asimina pygmaea is shed as permanent tetrads. It is pollinated by the dark flower scarab beetle Euphoria sepulcralis. Its flowers produce several scent compounds including dimethyl sulfide which is associated with carrion odor and may attract beetle pollinators. =Habitat and distribution= It has been observed growing in well-drained sandy soils, in pine flatwoods, savannahs and old fields.

The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast have whaling traditions dating back millennia, and the hunting of cetaceans continues by Alaska Natives (mainly beluga and narwhal, but also the subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale) and to a lesser extent by the Makah people (gray whale). In the twentieth century there was a commercial whaling industry, small by global standards, in British Columbia and south-east Alaska, as evidenced by place names such as Blubber Bay. When Coal Harbour closed its whaling station in the late 1960s, the industrial killing of whales in Pacific Canada was over. By that point, marine entrepreneurs had moved on to hunting orcas (killer whales) for live capture, to be displayed in aquaria. That lasted about a decade, till public pressure put an end to it in the mid 1970s. As the twentieth century whaling stations existed in British Columbia and Alaska, and so are covered in more detail in the articles Whaling in Canada and Whaling in the United States respectively, some of the pre-contact hunting - and, for that matter, some of the orca captures too - took place across the waters of the two countries, so this article will deal with the whole coast.  History  Nootka whaler hat Indigenous whaling traditions along the Pacific Northwest coast date as far back as 4000 years BCE and are deeply intertwined with the culture of many pre-contact Indigenous peoples in these territories. Amongst the Nuu-Chah- Nulth, Makah, and Ditidaht (also known as the whaling people) similarities in whale hunting practices can be found. Ethnographic evidence shows whaling was practiced amongst the Mowachat, Ahousaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ucluelet, Tseshaht, Quileute, and Quinault. Evidence also connects pre-contact whaling practices to the Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw and Haida First Nations. Within each of these communities whaling has played an integral role in society, politics, and economy as well as cultural and spiritual activities. Whaling can be found in the oral histories, creation stories, music, and art of whaling peoples and as such has intimately impacted their governance and cultural identity.  Traditions and rituals  Whaling holds a deep social and economic prestige for whaling First Nations and therefore could only be led by whaling chiefs. The more successful hunts a whaling chief had, the more power and wealth the chief held. The whaling chief (haw‚Äôiih) and his wife (haquum) were required to perform special rituals and ceremonies, often months prior to the whale hunt. It was believed that through the spirit world the haw‚Äôiih and haquum could connect to the whale, determining a successful hunt or not. Beginning in the early morning, the whaling chief would bathe four times, being sure to completely submerge himself each time. After each submersion the chief would then take bundles of various branches and nettles and rub them over his entire body. The chief would slowly and purposefully imitate a whale's actions and movements, rising to the surface and blowing water from his mouth towards the middle of the body of water he was bathing in. His wife held a rope tied around his waist, symbolic of the harpoon, and would sing a song to the spirit of the whale, telling it how they wanted it to act during the hunt. The haw‚Äôiith and haquum were also required to practice abstinence during the ritual purification. While the hunt was in progress the haquum remained in the home, lying still and moving as little as possible. It was believed that during the hunt the haquum‚Äôs power was so strong she could transform into the whale. To take one example, Maquinna, chief of the Nuu-chah-nulth people of Nootka Sound during the heyday of the maritime fur trade in the 1780s and 1790s, worshipped at the Yuquot Whalers Shrine, which was eventually sold to an ethnographic collector and now resides in New York's American Museum of Natural History. After successfully harpooning a whale, a member from the crew would make two cuts along its fluke. This would then be followed by a fatal blow to the whale's heart. Once the animal was dead, it was necessary to sew the mouth closed to prevent the carcass from sinking. This was done by cutting a hole in the top lip and lower jaw and tying the mouth closed. Floats made of seal skins would then be attached to the whale and the crews would begin towing the carcass back to shore. Further ceremonies were held after a successful hunt in honour of the whale spirit that gave itself to the whaling chief and his people.  Distribution of whale resources  Once the carcass was ashore, butchering would begin, with the most prized piece of flesh, the whale's saddle (including the dorsal fin), being given to the whaling chief. After receiving their cut of meat and blubber, the whaling chief and his wife would return home and hang the saddle outside their house for oil extraction. The meat and blubber would be adorned with eagle feathers and down in order to honour the whale's sacrifice. The lines of the harpoon used to kill the whale were hung on two poles and more feathers along with the whale's eyes were placed next to the saddle. Following the first cut of the whale, the remaining meat was subsequently distributed among the whaling crews and remaining community members based on social standing. For four days following the successful hunt, the whaling chief and his wife would host ceremonies giving thanks to the whale's spirit, culminating in a feast of the saddle for themselves and the crew. Whaling season began in early spring with the migration of the grey whales from their breeding ground in the Baja peninsula. Grey and humpback whales made up the majority of whales hunted along Pacific Northwest coast. Well adapted to the natural environment, pre- contact whaling people's obtained three-quarters of their meat and oil from whales. Whale oil was extremely high in nutrients and was extracted from the blubber, as well as, the bones. Bones were also used to make tools and household objects, as well as in architecture and water irrigation. Harpoon blades, made from sharpened mussel shells, were often adorned with whaling images. Harpoons were usually made from wood and had barbs made of bone or antler. Pacific Northwest canoes were often 28‚Äì38 feet long, big enough to fit an eight-man whaling crew. See also * John R.

They have owned the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball since George Steinbrenner purchased the franchise in 1973. After George's death, Hal Steinbrenner, his son, became the chairman of the Yankees. The Steinbrenner family also has financial interests in real estate, horse racing, and car racing. Forbes estimated the Steinbrenner family to be worth $3.8 billion in 2015, making them the 75th richest family in the United States. First generation Businessman George Steinbrenner owned the American Ship Building Company and served as its chairman, as well as purchasing sports franchises. He led a group that bought the New York Yankees from CBS in 1973 for $10 million ($ in current dollar terms). He sold two garages included in the sale, reducing the purchase price to $8.8 million ($ in current dollar terms). He invested $168,000 of his own money ($ in current dollar terms) in the sale. In 2009, Forbes estimated the Yankees to be worth $1.5 billion. Steinbrenner died in July 2010. George married Joan Zieg on May 12, 1956. Joan was a philanthropist and invested in real estate. Additionally, she served as a vice chairperson for the Yankees. She died in December 2018. Second generation Hal Steinbrenner in 2009 George and Joan had four children: Hank, Jessica, Jennifer, Hal. All four serve as general partners for the Yankees. Hank was the oldest of the four children. He was co-chairman of the Yankees and died in 2020. Hal is the youngest of the four. He is chairman and CEO of Steinbrenner Hotel Properties. Hal became chairman of the Yankees in 2008, succeeding his father. Jessica runs Kinsman Farm, a stud farm, in Ocala, Florida. She has also authored children's books. Jessica has been married and divorced three times. Her second marriage was to Joe Molloy, who served as managing general partner of the Yankees in 1992, while George was banned from baseball. Her third husband, Felix Lopez, served as a vice president for the Yankees. Jennifer majored in business and was a Morehead Scholar at the University of North Carolina, before serving in the Yankees Public Affairs Department in 1984-85 and spending 23 years actively participating in the philanthropic community. However, George did not let her rise in the Yankees organization, saying \\"I've always been a chauvinist.\\" Jennifer married Steve Swindal, who became a general partner in the Yankees and was named George's heir as chairman of the Yankees in 2005. They divorced in 2007, and the Steinbrenner family purchased Swindal's financial interests in the franchise. Jennifer has a distinguished record of contributing to various community projects and initiatives, including current commitments on the Board of Directors of Mary Lee‚Äôs House (a child protection and advocacy center in Tampa), St. Joseph‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital Foundation, Boys & Girls Club of Tampa Bay and serving on the Executive Committee of the Gold Shield Foundation, which was established in 1981 by her father, George M. Steinbrenner III. She also serves as the President of the New York Yankees Foundation and the New York Yankees Tampa Foundation, overseeing numerous local, regional and national outreach efforts. Within the scope of her roles, which include the implementation and integration of a wide range of community programs relating to the New York Yankees, Ms. Steinbrenner supervises three Tampa-area Children‚Äôs Holiday Concerts that have been sponsored by the Steinbrenner family for more than 25 years. At least 5,000 children annually participate in the events, which provide musical education and exposure to the fine arts. She has also been instrumental in the development and growth of the Bronx Winter Wonderland event, which sees thousands of local youth visit the Stadium each year for a holiday extravaganza complete with decorations, festive music and food, and a holiday gift for each child in attendance. Third generation George and Joan Steinbrenner's children have had 14 grandchildren. Robert Molloy, the son of Jessica and Joe Molloy, is a film producer. He runs the production company Pinstripe Productions. George Michael Steinbrenner IV, the son of Hank, formed an IndyCar driving team in conjunction with Andretti Autosport in 2017 called Andretti-Steinbrenner Racing. The team competed in the 2017 Indy Lights. In 2018, he formed Harding Steinbrenner Racing with partner Mike Harding, competing in the 2019 IndyCar Series. In April 2020, Robert accepted an invitation to be Vice-president of English football club, Matlock Town, who were in dire financial struggles. Stephen Swindal Jr. works in baseball operations for the Yankees. Haley Swindal is a singer and actress. She has performed in Broadway shows. According to Jennifer, the family wants to own the team for \\"eternity\\". Hal said the family had begun discussing future plans for the family's involvement in the franchise, and that several of George's grandchildren, including Stephen Swindal Jr., George Michael Steinbrenner IV, Robert Molloy, Julia Steinbrenner Vinas (George IV's sister), and Katherine Steinbrenner (Hal's daughter), have expressed interest in running the Yankees.

It served as the high school for black students until the public schools were integrated. A 2009 tax amendment provided funds to rebuild the school, which reopened in 2012. History =Integration= In 1963, the Muscogee County School District formed a special committee on desegregation. In September of that year, the school board approved a freedom of choice plan which would integrate one grade each year. In January 1964, the NAACP filed a lawsuit Lockett v. the Board of Education of Muscogee School District asserting that the district maintained an inferior school system for negroes. Superintendent Shaw testified that segregation was a \\"long and universal custom\\" and that abandoning it would \\"injure the feelings and physical well- being of the children\\". Nevertheless, in September 1968, the MCSD ruled that all grades were to be integrated through freedom of choice. When the federal court case U. S. v. Jefferson County Board of Education ruled that teaching staffs must also be integrated, the district agreed to assign at least two teachers who would be in the racial minority at every school. Both teachers and students considered the goal of this time period to be more focused on survival than on education. By 1970, under the freedom of choice plan, 27 of 67 schools in the district remained completely segregated. Most of the white schools employed only the mandated two black teachers, but many of the black schools employed more white teachers. Under the threat of a cutoff of $1.8 million in federal funds, the school district integrated the schools in 1971, resulting in a 70% white student population at Carver. Pictures of George Washington Carver were removed to soothe white students. In 1997 federal jurisdiction over the school district ended.

The 1990 Surinamese coup d'√©tat, usually referred to as the Telephone Coup (), was a military coup in Suriname on 24 December 1990. The coup was carried out by the acting commander-in-chief of the Suriname National Army (SNL), Police Chief Ivan Graanoogst. As a result of the coup, President Ramsewak Shankar was dismissed from power, and parliament and government were disbanded.  Background  On 25 February 1980, a military coup d'√©tat occurred in Suriname that was organized by Senior Sergeant D√©si Bouterse. Bouterse started to rule Suriname like a dictator, heading the National Military Council (promoting himself to Lieutenant Colonel, the highest rank in the SNL). He dissolved the National Assembly, suspended the constitution, imposed a state of emergency in the country, and created a special tribunal that considered the cases of members of the previous government. In 1987, Bouterse agreed to reinstate the constitution and hold election if he remained the head of the SNL. However, in the November 1987 general election, his National Democratic Party received only 3 of 51 seats in the National Assembly, and the opposition received 40. The presidential election, held on 25 January 1988, was won by Ramsewak Shankar, who was disliked by the SNL, and Henck Arron, who was overthrown during the 1980 coup, was appointed prime minister. Tension between the government and the SNL was growing. On 22 December 1990, Bouterse resigned as commander-in- chief and stated that he could not fulfill the role of a clown who \\"does not have pride and dignity.\\" He was temporarily succeeded by Graanoogst.  Coup  On 24 December 1990, around midnight Suriname Time (UTC‚àí03:00), Graanoogst told President Shankar by telephone that he was being deposed and that he and his government \\"had better stay home.\\" On 27 December, the government was dismissed, the National Assembly was dissolved, and Johan Kraag was appointed as president on 29 December. On 31 December, Bouterse was reappointed as commander-in-chief of the SNL.  World reactions  The Netherlands reacted negatively to the coup and stopped allocating funds for the development of Suriname. Only after the inauguration of President Ronald Venetiaan in 1991 did relations between Suriname and the Netherlands improve significantly. Because the international community perceived the coup negatively, the SNL was forced under international pressure to hold the May 1991 general election with the participation of international observers.  Consequences  Less than a year later, Lieutenant Colonel Bouterse again transferred power to the civilian government, which was again led by the opposition. Since then, Suriname has been governed by coalition government. From 1991 to 1996, the president was Ronald Venetiaan, an opponent of Bouterse. During the 2010 presidential election, Bouterse was elected president.  References   Bibliography  * Aniel P. Bangoer: De telefooncoup: grondwet, recht en macht in Suriname, Uitg.

Across the country different groups began lobbying for temperance by arguing that alcohol was morally corrupting and hurting families economically, when men would drink their family's money away. This temperance movement paved the way for some women to join the Prohibition movement, which they often felt was necessary due to their personal experiences dealing with drunk husbands and fathers, and because it was one of the few ways for women to enter politics in the era. One of the most notable groups that pushed for Prohibition was the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. On the other end of the spectrum was the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform, who were instrumental in getting the 18th Amendment repealed. These women argued that Prohibition was a breach of the rights of American citizens and frankly ineffective due to the prevalence of bootlegging. __TOC__  Origin  = Women's Crusade = The Women's Crusade was the precursor to the Women's Christian Temperance Union. It was also known as the Women's Praying Crusade in response to their tactic of praying publicly in front of saloons. It started as a religious group, motivated by their determination to end the alcoholism that they saw as a social ill. The Crusade was organized in Ohio in 1874 and created an opportunity for women to promote national temperance. Unlike the WCTU, the Women's Crusade was not a political organization and had the sole focus of temperance. The movement started due to the lectures given by Dr. Diocletian Lewis, who told the story of his mother getting a saloon to close by praying and singing. Though his techniques had been tried before, they had had limited success. The movement began to have success in Hillsboro, Ohio, where men and women who heard his lecture excitedly decided to try his methods. Men provided financial and emotional support, but women were the face of the movement. Hillsboro had moderate success, but it was after another one of Lewis‚Äô lectures in Washington Court House, Ohio, that the movement really began to have success. After Hillsboro and Washington Court House, crusades erupted in small towns all over Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. There was some success in towns like Philadelphia, but the most successful crusades were in smaller towns. Nationwide a total of 750 breweries closed, and many shopkeepers pledged to sell alcohol only to those with prescriptions. The tactics of the movement involved picketing, praying and singing hymns publicly, marching in the streets, and asking for pledges from local shopkeepers and saloon owners. Saloons that were particularly harsh towards the crusaders would often have women stand in front of their doors, blocking entry, such was the case at a saloon in Adrian, Michigan after the saloon owner locked two of the women leaders in the saloon. Not all women supported the movement. Some women spat at the crusaders alongside their male companions, either because they felt it wasn't a woman's place to act so publicly, or because they didn't support temperance. Whatever the reason, many women and men saw drinking as a serious moral issue and supported the crusaders. = Populist Party = The Populist party faced divisions within itself, but the majority of its members were individually for the Prohibition Reform. However, they never officially announced where they stood on their view of the movement as a collective group. Francis E. Willard was one of many who urged the Populist party to make an official statement. She tried to fuse the WCTU with the Prohibition party because they seemed to be making an impact on Populist members. She received opposition in her attempt because the Prohibition party didn't feel ready to support Women's Suffrage on top of what they were already trying to reform. However, the Populist party still had allies such as James Baird Weaver and Ignatius Donnelly who were in full support of both Prohibition and Women's Suffrage.  Women's Christian Temperance Union  left The Women's Christian Temperance Union was organized on November 18, 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio. It quickly became the largest women's organization in the United States. The women in the movement were inspired by the serious drinking problem in the United States and the disproportionate ills that befell women whose husbands were drunkards. It was seen as both a moral and home issue, allowing women to join the political sphere in unprecedented ways. Men were barred from voting and holding office within the movement, though they were asked to contribute financially. The Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded by Annie Wittenmyer in 1874. In 1879 Frances E. Willard became the new president and remained president until her death. The organization did not purely focus on temperance, but also promoted other social controls and the issue of equality for women. These other issues were part of Willard's ‚ÄúDo Everything‚Äù policy. The WCTU was united under a common leader, Willard, but had significant autonomy for local chapters. Willard often traveled the country to promote the WCTU and visit local chapters. She visited Texas in 1882 and California in 1883. These visits inspired rapid membership growth.  Notable Women in the Movement  Frances Willard before 1898.There were many women that gained prominence during the Prohibition era, whether supporting or fighting the 18th Amendment. Among them were Presidents and members of the WCTU, and founders of the WONPR. = Annie Wittenmyer = Annie Wittenmyer was born Annie Turner in Ohio in 1827. After the Civil War, Annie aligned herself with the Women's Crusade. She went to a convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where the Women's Christian Temperance Union was formed and she was voted as the first official president. Annie worked closely with Frances Willard, who was the secretary. They had opposing views regarding the WCTU's involvement in women's suffrage, so Annie became president of a new faction, the Non-Partisan Women's Christian Temperance Union (the group would not involve itself with women's suffrage). = Frances Willard = Frances Willard was born September 28, 1839 in New York. She was a founder of the Women's Temperance Union and President from 1879 until her death in 1898. Willard was a very spiritual woman due to her upbringing and a brush with death when she was 19. She was very interested in the Women's Crusade, and eventually became the President of the Chicago chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, despite a higher paying job offer at a college. Five years later she was voted into the Presidency of the entire Women's Christian Temperance Union. As the President, she gained national recognition and was praised for her competence. Frances Willard toured Texas in 1882 in order to organize WCTU chapters. It was at the end of a larger tour through the South. The movement struggled in the more conservative southern states, but her tour garnered large crowds and some success. It did not achieve long-term success and Texas prohibitionists maintained their separation from the northern based prohibition movement and Willard herself. = Carrie A. Nation = Carrie Nation, originally Carrie Amelia Moore, was born in Kentucky in 1846. Her name is also sometimes spelled Carry. She is most famous for her extreme opposition of alcohol and taking action by destroying bars and saloons with a hatchet. Carrie was very religious and would often pray or sing while swinging her hatchet across the United States. During her time and in history books, Carrie has been depicted as unnecessarily violent and domineering in her support of the Prohibition movement. No group claims that she was a part of what they stood for (feminists, various Christian religions, the WCTU). Carrie also published The Smasher‚Äôs Mail newspaper where people sent in their reactions to the destroying of saloons, which Carrie saw as a noble cause. Some people praised her actions, while others were more than angry with the way she handled violations of the Prohibition. = Anna Gordon = Anna Gordon was born in Boston on July 21, 1853. She joined the Women's Christian Temperance Union after becoming Frances Willard‚Äôs private secretary. = Pauline Morton Sabin = Pauline Morton Sabin was born in 1887 to a wealthy family. After her divorce and subsequent remarriage to Charles Hamilton Sabin, she became involved in charity and political work. She organized Republican meetings and parties on her estate, leading her to eventually found the National Women‚Äôs Republican Club in 1921. She was the first woman to serve on the National Republican Committee. She continued work in politics, eventually campaigning for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election. Her work in Prohibition was inspired by her distaste for the hypocrisy of politicians who supported Prohibition only in public and the clear ineffectiveness of the law. She had supported Herbert Hoover, a Prohibitionist, but after his inaugural address decided to organize the anti-Prohibitionist women of America against the party‚Äôs platform.  Opposition  There was opposition to Prohibition during and after the fight for it. The belief that women would vote as a block, a widespread fear during the suffrage movement, was proven wrong with the development of the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform. There were also many women who joined auxiliary groups to fight alongside their husbands or other male relations against the 18th Amendment. = Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform = Time magazine cover July 18, 1932, featuring Pauline Morton Sabin, founder and head of the WONPR. The Women‚Äôs Organization for National Prohibition Reform was organized on May 28th, 1929 in Chicago. Five national committees were formed, including: Investigation, Publicity, Speakers‚Äô Bureau, Legislative, and Membership. The organization was financed by voluntary contributions and not membership dues. At their peak they had over a million members. The primary founder, Pauline Morton Sabin, gathered the group following after Ella Boole proclaimed to Congress that she represented all women. The WONPR's argument against Prohibition was its ineffectiveness and how it encouraged disrespect of the law and the Constitution. Bootlegging was common, and once the Great Depression began, many were hoping simply for more jobs and the tax money that would come from legal selling of alcohol again. Some believed that the WONPR was simply an auxiliary of the AAPA (Association Against the Prohibition Amendment). However, they were independent groups, and differed in opinion on certain matters, such as the WONPR's general endorsement of the Democratic party after they added the wet plank to their platform during the 1932 election. After their organization, they supported the end of Prohibition through legal and political means. During the Presidential and Congressional campaigns of 1932, they supported those who supported repeal, regardless of which party they belong to. This was despite concerns that the WONPR would simply vote Democrat. For example, in the Senate race in California, the WONPR endorsed the wet Republican over the dry Democrat. The women in this organization were involved in conventions, met with politicians, and were present and involved in the state ratifying conventions which voted on ratification of the 21st Amendment, putting an end to Prohibition. After the ratification of the 21st Amendment, the WONPR was dissolved. = Molly Pitcher Clubs = There were many anti-Prohibition movements besides the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform. The Association Against the Prohibition Amendment had female chapters they named Molly Pitcher Clubs. This club never gained much national recognition, and likely did not grow very large. = Bootleggers = Most recorded bootleggers were men involved in shady business that had connections to crime lords, but women were typically overlooked in this particular practice. There were many female bootleggers, but only 173 individual cases were recorded. Of those recorded cases, there were certain demographic patterns. Most female bootleggers were mothers who were trying to financially support their families, whether they were widows or not. Mothers usually stayed home to take care of their children and brewing alcohol was not a challenge with privacy and access to kitchens. A majority of female bootleggers were immigrants. They felt more justified in their actions since they had come from various cultures that did not see the creation or consumption of alcohol as an issue. When arrested for illegal sales of alcohol most women admitted to their actions, but appealed to the judge that their motives were to provide their children with basic necessities. However, there was a high risk of mothers losing custody of their children when they were arrested, even if there was nobody left to care for them while their mother served a jail sentence. = Changes in Social Life = Before Prohibition women generally stayed away from saloons and bars, mostly drinking behind the closed doors of their own homes. During Prohibition, however, women started occupying more public areas such as speakeasies. Breaking rules seemed to appeal to a large population of women and drinking in a public setting was no longer limited to those considered to have low morals.  African American Women  = Bootlegging = Out of the 173 cases of recorder female bootleggers, six of them were African American women. It is unknown as to why this ratio is low. African Americans generally opposed Prohibition, but there has been little investigation on their role in bootlegging. They were either majorly unrepresented, or they followed the law despite their general feelings about Prohibition. = Political Views = Most African Americans opposed Prohibition. However, African American women felt that they needed to remain loyal to the Republican party that had put an end to slavery and gave them more rights as citizens. They were torn between their desire for alcohol and their loyalty to a party that supported the Prohibition. They also believed that the Democratic party was using their opposition to Prohibition to attract more African American voters which would eventually lead to the organization of oppression.  Reactions to the Movement  There were mixed reactions to the movement. Some thought that they were pursuing a noble cause, but others believed that Prohibition was a failure and an overreach on the part of the government. The newspaper Carrie Nation was an editor for in Topeka, Kansas was titled The Smasher‚Äôs Mail and published scathing reviews of Nation's actions the first week of February, 1901. Some of those that wrote in claimed that God was in favor of saloons and criticized her for saying she was a follower of God. Others praised her for her actions. = Class Divides = There is controversy over class divides in the support for Prohibition. Some claim that working class-women supported Prohibition because they viewed alcohol as the vice keeping them in poverty. Their husbands would go and drink their money away, leaving them without the money to buy food and other supplies. Others claim that working-class women, along with their husbands, were for repeal because of the new power it gave to police forces to interfere with their lives.

(January 8, 1901 ‚Äì November 11, 1974) was an American academic philosopher, writer, Jesuit, and Catholic priest. Born in New York City, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1917, and began his studies at Woodstock College. Following his undergraduate and graduate work there, he taught at Jesuit institutions in the Philippines until 1927. Following his ordination in 1930, he received doctorates in theology and philosophy from the Pontifical Gregorian University and the University of Paris, respectively. He then returned to the United States, where he became a professor of philosophy at Woodstock College and Fordham University. In 1943, Guthrie became the chairman of graduate philosophy at Georgetown University and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In this role, he admitted the first women to the school on equal terms as men. For twenty years, he promoted the belief that intellectuals must play a central role in combatting the ideologies that led to World War II. To that end, he was a member of the drafting committee of the UNESCO charter, was a co-founder of an American academy of Catholic intellectuals, and travelled the world with the U.S. State Department, for which he received honors from several countries and organizations. Guthrie became the president of Georgetown University in 1949, and a major decision he made was to abolish the university‚Äôs football program, believing it to be inconsistent with the educational purpose of a Catholic university. He also oversaw construction of McDonough Gymnasium. His tenure ended abruptly in 1952, when he did not return at the start of the academic year. His resignation resulted from illness, as well as frustration with senior administrators who resisted his attempts to centralize governance of the university. In his later years, he taught at Saint Joseph's College in Philadelphia, and died in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, in 1974.  Early life  Joseph Hunter Guthrie was born on January 8, 1901 in New York City, to parents Jacob Francis Guthrie and Mary Guthrie (n√©e Ross). He enrolled at Fordham Preparatory School in 1913, and graduated in 1917. On July 30 of that year, he entered the Society of Jesus at the novitiate of St. Andrew-on- Hudson. Guthrie began studying science and philosophy at Weston College in Massachusetts, and completed his undergraduate education at Woodstock College in Maryland, where he graduated in 1923 with a Bachelor of Arts and in 1924 with a Master of Arts. Guthrie then taught English, Latin, and rhetoric at the seminary in Vigan, in the Philippines, from 1924 to 1925, and English, Latin, and economics at the Ateneo de Manila University from 1925 to 1927. He also coached drama at both the Vigan Seminary and Ateneo, which resulted in his Ateneo Passion Play being performed in 1927 at the Manila Grand Opera House. = European studies = Guthrie returned to Woodstock College that year, traveling through China, Japan, North Africa, and India on his return voyage. On June 23, 1930, he was ordained a Catholic priest at Woodstock. He was then sent to the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree in 1931. He spent the following year studying ascetical theology at the Drongen Abbey and at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. On August 15, 1934, he professed his final vows in the Chapel of Saint Denis on Montmartre in Paris, which were received by Anthony Joseph Schuler, the Bishop of El Paso, Texas. Guthrie began work on his doctorate in philosophy, studying at the University of Berlin, the University of Munich, the University of Frieburg, and the University of Paris. During this time, he became ill with tuberculosis, which required that he be treated in Asheville, North Carolina. He then returned to the University of Paris to defend his dissertation on phenomenology, for which he was awarded a with highest honors in 1937. During his time in Europe, Guthrie studied under Martin Heidegger, Werner Jaeger, and Emile Br√©dier, and was closely acquainted with Edith Stein, Simone Weil, Jacques Maritain, and √âtienne Gilson. He was also in contact with the Vienna Circle. As a result, his philosophical interests were German existentialism, logical positivism, and analytic philosophy, the latter of which he studied a decade before it become prominent in American universities. Following his education, Guthrie taught philosophy at Woodstock College from 1937 to 1940. He became a professor and chairman of the department of graduate philosophy at Fordham University in 1940, remaining in the position for three years. He was also an assistant editor of The Journal of Philosophy, Thought, and Philosophy Abstracts, and was a prolific author.  Georgetown University  = Deanship = In 1943, Guthrie was appointed chairman of the graduate department of philosophy at Georgetown University, which made him ex officio the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Later, he also was named the chairman of deans of the university. During his term, the first eleven women were admitted to the graduate school on equal status as men. The president of the university, Lawrence C. Gorman, described this action as initially experimental and as a \\"wartime concession\\" that proved successful. Guthrie sought to revitalize the graduate school, and recruited prominent faculty who fled Europe during World War II, especially those in the fields of philosophy and political science. The reputation and quality of academics in the graduate department of philosophy, which had a separate location and faculty from its undergraduate counterpart, was greatly improved during his term, and it was said that the graduate school \\"firmly established\\" itself for the first time. Having succeeded Edward C. Phillips as dean, Guthrie was replaced by Gerard Yates.  Worldwide academic advocacy  Following the end of World War II, Guthrie became a proponent of making academia a key instrument in securing future world peace by combating ideologies of nationalism, totalitarianism, and scientific racism. To that end, he became a member of the U.S. Commission on Restructuring Education, which met at Princeton University in 1940, alongside British academics, to implement democratic principles in education. He was also a member of the chartering committee of UNESCO, which met in Nice in 1945. Guthrie supported a proposal by several Catholic intellectuals to create an American academy for Catholic thought. This occurred in the context of many American think tanks and intellectual organizations, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, reevaluating their purposes and missions, so as to ensure that another world war would never happen again. The body's twofold mission would be \\"reconstructing Catholic intellectual life\\" in the aftermath of the war, and maintaining a \\"presence in the total work of the United Nations Educational and Scientific Organization.\\" Guthrie envisioned the organization as being composed primarily of academic laymen, rather than clergy. Eventually, the academy came to fruition, and he became a co-founder of the Catholic Commission on Intellectual and Cultural Affairs (CCICA) in 1946. He was also a member of the American Academy of Political and Social Science and the Medieval Academy of America. Guthrie was a prolific traveller, visiting every continent except Australia. He traveled as an exchange specialist with the U.S. Department of State and the United States Information Agency to the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America from 1947 to 1950. He was a polyglot, being fluent in four languages and able to read in four more. Guthrie received the Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit of Spain in 1948 for his writings on the Spanish philosopher Francisco Su√°rez, and lectures at the University of Barcelona, University of Madrid, and University of Salamanca. He received the Freedoms Foundation Award in 1950, the National Order of Honour and Merit of Haiti in 1954, and the Air University Award in 1958 for casting a tie-breaking vote to create the Air University. Film director Samuel Bronston consulted with Guthrie in the 1950s on films set in Ancient Greece and Rome. = Presidency = On February 18, 1949, Guthrie was appointed to succeed Gorman as the president of Georgetown University. Under his leadership, McDonough Gymnasium was built, with construction starting in 1950, and the building opening in December 1951. One of Guthrie's first actions was the revival of the board of regents in April 1949, whose purpose was to advise the president and participate in fundraising and promotion of the university. Another of his primary goals was to centralize the university administration under the office of the president. At the time he took office, the schools of medicine, law, and foreign service operated close to autonomously in their governance, finances, and academics. Much of Guthrie's philosophy of education was motivated by his support for scholasticism. He wrote against the modern conception of academic freedom as a \\"false liberty to license\\" that deprived students of the \\"divine dimension of reality\\". In this view, university-level education should teach students of the divine revelation. At the same time, he advocated for the sort of classical education that existed in antiquity, although supplemented by modern science. In sum, he believed that modern thought had little to offer. Guthrie's presidency came to an end abruptly in 1952. In the summer of that year, he left for the American West for a retreat and to fundraise. He did not return at the start of the academic year, prompting many rumors on campus. He submitted his resignation to the university board of directors the following October, and it was announced that the Jesuit authorities in Rome had selected Edward B. Bunn as his successor. One historian later determined that Guthrie's ousting was not entirely voluntary, but rather was due to a combination of factors. In July 1952, his health had begun to deteriorate; he moved in with his mother in Annapolis, Maryland, and soon thereafter was treated at hospitals in Baltimore, Maryland and Charlotte, North Carolina. Additionally, he had become frustrated with the fact that each of the university professional schools was headed by a Jesuit regent. They vigorously opposed his attempts to centralize the administration of the university, and when Guthrie tried to invoke the authorities in Rome to support his effort, he felt that he did not have their backing.  Abolition of football  One major decision of Guthrie's presidency was to discontinue Georgetown's football program in 1951. He offered multiple reasons for his decision, the first of which was that the sport contributed little to the educational purpose of the university and was unbecoming of a Catholic educational institution. Financial considerations also motivated Guthrie. He disapproved that collegiate football had become \\"big business.\\" The sport consumed the vast majority of the university's entire sports budget, and, combined with ancillary costs of running the program, resulted in a substantial, annual net deficit. Moreover, the team had been performing poorly for many seasons. As a result, Georgetown became the most prominent of 38 schools‚Äîmany of them Catholic‚Äîto drop their football programs by 1951, and the university saw a gradual de-emphasis of sports in general. Guthrie's decision prompted a strong backlash from alumni, although the football program was not restored until 12 years later.  Later years  Guthrie continued to suffer from the damage tuberculosis had done to his lungs. After spending time recuperating, he became a professor at Saint Joseph's College in Philadelphia in 1953, and for a time, served as chair of the department of philosophy. He was interested in people who learn differently and worked intensively with one student, who he identified has having a learning disability that science later would identify as dyslexia. He also advocated for the creation of a Latin American studies program at Saint Joseph's, which was created in 1960. Guthrie assumed professor emeritus status at Saint Joseph's in 1969. He died on November 11, 1974, at the Jesuit novitiate of St. Isaac Jogues in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. His body was returned to Georgetown University and was buried in the Jesuit Community Cemetery.

Existence of an Innermost Inner Core was proposed by Adam Dziewonski and Miaki Ishii to explain the discrepancies in certain fit to travel-time wave models of the Inner Core. The status of the Innermost Inner Core as a distinct entity is contested. Detractors argue that anomalous data can be explained with other methods.  Proposed models  The Innermost Inner Core model proposes a distinct laterally homogeneous anisotropic sphere within the Inner Core. Earth's solid Inner Core. Estimates differ on the size of the Innermost sphere. Dziewonski and Ishii call for a radius of 300 km. Trampert et. al. put forth a different model, with a radius of 400 km.  Implications  The existence of distinct anisotropic spheres within the Inner Core would represent evidence of two distinct periods of Inner Core formation. It has also been theorized that the anisotropy observed represents an unknown phase change in iron. Understanding the anisotropic structure of the innermost inner core would be an important constraint on inner core composition.  Other explanations  In 2012, Lythgoe et. al. proposed the existence of anisotropic hemispheres within the Inner Core as an alternative to the Innermost Inner Core theories. The study suggests that Ishii et. al.'s conclusions were due to faulty statistical analysis, and claims the data are best described by hemispheric anisotropy.

She is well known for her work utilizing video to understand the behavior of various species of birds.  Education & early career  Kane received her Bachelor of Science degree in physics in 1982 from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She then attended Harvard University for her Master of Science degree and her Phd. There she worked in the laboratory of applied physicist Peter Pershan. Her thesis, entitled Optical and X-Ray Studies of Critical Phenomena in Thin Liquid Crystal Films and published in 1989, focused on utilizing x-ray and light scattering techniques to study biological membranes and low-dimensional soft matter systems. Following her PhD, she became a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Pennsylvania, working in the laboratory of J. Kent Blasie between 1988 and 1990. There, she continued her work using scattering techniques to understand the structures of multilayer films and biological membranes.  Research  In 1991, Kane became an Assistant Professor at Haverford College, where she was eventually promoted to Professor in 2016. Kane's research centers on the intersection between biophysics, soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics to understand a range of topics, from the behavior of birds to the bacterial diversity of ecosystems, using experimental techniques that include bioacoustics, computer modeling, and 3D video analysis. Kane's group has worked to understand a range of bird behaviors. In 2016, her group published a study on how raptors (like hawks, vultures, and falcons) hunt, turning their heads unpredictably as they visually search for their prey. Raptors hunt by alternating periods of rapid head or eye movement‚Äîa movement that is known as saccades‚Äîwith periods during which their eyes are fixed on a specific point. To determine if there was a discernible pattern to this movement, they fitted a Northern goshawk with a tiny head-mounted camera to track its head movements while hunting. They used the video to determine the mathematical distribution of time spent during each saccade and time spent with their heads still and found that the time between each saccade varied depending on external environmental cues, which changed as the hawks honed in on their target. Notably, this behavior is similar to that of primates while they hunt, suggesting that the basic neural processes underlying hunting are the same between primate and raptor hunters. Kane and her team have also studied the predator-prey interactions as Goshawks hunt and their prey evade. Once again, by mounting a camera on a goshawk's head, she observed the different pursuit strategies employed by a hawk as it pursues its prey. Goshawks employ one of two strategies when pursuing their prey, either intercepting the path of their prey at an oblique angle, or chasing their prey by flying directly after it. They also discovered a third pursuit strategy that they are working to classify. When hunting, a goshawk will use a combination of these flight trajectories. In an earlier study, analyzing video of falcons hunting, Kane observed a similar combination flight pattern, with falcons switching between the intercept and chase strategy. Her team also observed that falcons kept their prey at a fixed position to one side, rather than attacking them straight on, exploiting an effect known as motion camouflage to minimize the chance that their prey will detect them. In this particular study, Kane and her group attached cameras to backpacks strapped to the birds or on helmets strapped to their heads to record their movement. peacock feather contribute to the reproductive success of male peacocks. Kane has also studied the biomechanics of peacock courtship rituals. Specifically, her group focused on how feather biomechanics influence the performance of male peacocks as they court females by fanning out and vibrating their tail feathers, a display behavior known as \\"train-rattling.\\" Kane initially discovered high-speed recordings of the behavior, captured by her collaborator Roslyn Dakin, who was studying the color of peacock feathers. The two began working together to capture more videos of peacock courtship rituals to understand how the tail feathers vibrate, and how those vibrations are received by the females. They found that the train-rattling behavior only occurs when females are present and that, as the tail shakes, the eyespots on the tail appear not to move, leading them to conclude that the shaking behavior enhances the appearance of the eyespots of the tail. In previous work, Dakin found that the hue and iridescence of the tail's eyespots contribute to the mating success of the male. They also found that the tail feathers vibrate at their natural resonance frequency, producing sound waves that are within the audible range that females are able to hear. Finally, they counterintuitively found that the longer and heavier the male's tail feathers were, the faster they were able to shake their feathers. In a follow-up study published in 2018, Kane and Dakin found that the vibrations sent out by males rattling their trains are actually felt by females on the crest of their head, which vibrates in turn. They found that at the base of the a female's crest feathers lies a tiny feather known as a filoplume, which acts as a mechanical sensor. When the crest feathers begin vibrating, the filoplume triggers a nerve cell, translating the physical vibrations of the plume into neuronal signal. To understand whether female plume vibrations were specifically in response to the mechanical signals sent out by male train rattling, Kane and Dakin used speakers to play a number of different sounds for female peacocks. The crests only vibrated in response to the train rattling sounds, with no response recorded when the researchers played white noise.  Awards & honors  * New Directions Fellowship, Andrew W.

Founded in 2013, the company provides close management software for corporate accounting departments to help them improve the way they close the books each month. Since launching, the company is regularly mentioned by industry publications as one of the best-reviewed employers in the Los Angeles tech community. In 2017, the company was named by the Los Angeles Business Journal as one of the best small companies to work at in Los Angeles. A year later, FloQast was recognized as one of the 15 best medium-sized companies to work for in Los Angeles. In January 2019, the company ranked #11 on Built In LA's 100 Best Places to Work in Los Angeles. The company announced the opening of a second office in February 2017, expanding to the Midwest with a new office and team in Columbus, Ohio.  History  FloQast was founded by CPAs and former corporate accountants Mike Whitmire and Chris Sluty, along with veteran software engineer Cullen Zandstra. Whitmire first conceived the idea for the company during his time Cornerstone OnDemand where he was a senior accountant. Having experienced firsthand the challenges accounting teams face when closing the books each month ‚Äî from inefficient procedures to outdated workflows and flawed organizational structures ‚ÄîWhitmire aimed to create a product that would support accounting and finance teams during the hectic financial close process. After devising the concept, Whitmire recruited Zandstra as Co-founder and CTO. The name FloQast was created with the help of a word generator using a combination of accounting terms and contemporary vernacular words. The two developed a minimum viable product (MVP), and were accepted into the prestigious Amplify.LA accelerator program. Following the company‚Äôs initial funding, Whitmire recruited his former Syracuse University classmate, Sluty, to join the team as Co-founder/COO/Head of Customer Success. In November 2014, the company raised a $1.3 million seed round of funding led by Amplify.LA and Toba Capital, before securing a $6.5 million Series A in early 2016. Following a period of growth in which the company tripled its revenues, FloQast raised a $25 million Series B in June 2017. Six months after the funding, the company relocated to a new 20,000-square-foot office in Sherman Oaks to accommodate a staff that had grown 250 percent in 2017 alone. In May 2020, Tipalti, the world's leading automation network for payables, establishes new partnership with FloQast, Affise, and Myers-Holum.  Product  FloQast is a Software as a Service (SaaS) application. The financial close management software works with Microsoft Excel and uses process management, reporting, and collaboration to automate the month-end closing of an organization‚Äôs financial books. The product provides accounting teams with checklists and tie-outs linked to Excel workbooks and the client of organizations‚Äô enterprise resources planning (ERP) system to automate reconciliations and, ultimately, shorten the financial close process. In 2019, the company introduced FloQast AutoRec, a tool that relies on artificial intelligence to help automate the reconciliation process. FloQast operates with cloud document storage systems Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Egnyte, as well as NetSuite and Sage Intacct financial applications. It is compatible with ERP/General Ledger systems, including Oracle, SAP, Microsoft (Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV), Sage, Epicor, QuickBooks, Financialforce, and others.

They are sometimes also called the King's Birthday Riots. Background Sir James Stirling, dressed as Lord Provost, with a view of Edinburgh Tolbooth prison behind 57.58 George Square in Edinburgh HMS Hind The riots came on the back of a period of civil unrest, variously sourced from feelings transferring from the French Revolution, further changes in the Corn Laws, food shortages, and a general unhappiness of the population with their leading figures in politics and law. A proclamation banning \\"seditious writing\\" had been passed in May 1792.http://www.incorporationofgoldsmiths.org/content/media/Edin.-Goldsmith-W.-Fortescue- article.pdf It was traditional at that time for officials and soldiers to celebrate the birthday of King George III: 4 June. On the days preceding the riots, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir James Stirling of Larbert, had cavalry soldiers roaming the Edinburgh streets to intimidate the population. This had the reverse effect, and angered the general population. The Riots On the evening of 4 June members of the City Guard and Cavalry were getting drunk at Old Parliament Hall near St Giles Cathedral. They fired pistols in the air with each toast. A mob appeared outside and were dispersed after some stone-throwing. No-one was injured. On the following evening (5 June) a small mob (not necessarily the same group) gathered outside the house of Robert Dundas of Arniston, Lord Justice Clerk at the time. This was at 57 George Square in the north-east corner. They had a straw effigy of a man. Dundas's neighbours, Admiral Duncan of Camperdown and Sir Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre, tried to dispel the crowd but stone-throwing began and they all sheltered in Dundas's house. The crowd began to break the windows and a servant was sent via the back door to run to Edinburgh Castle for assistance.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh The servant persuaded the commander of the castle to send around a dozen troops from the 53rd Cavalry Regiment, armed with sabres and pistols, to the Dundas house. Given the day, it is highly likely that the troops were intoxicated. Arriving at George Square probably around 40 to 60 minutes after being sent for, the crowd was still there. The Riot Act was read. This was a legal requirement before physical force was used, but the action in its own right is clearly inflammatory, as it implies an intention to attack. Immediately upon completion of the reading the troops burst through the crowd. The majority appear to have fled diagonally across the square, seeking the open ground of the Meadows. The wisdom of this against mounted troops is clearly dubious. Several bodies were found on the edge of the Meadows on the following morning. That evening (6 June) a new mob assembled outside the house of Sir James Stirling, 1st Baronet (the then Lord Provost of Edinburgh) on the south-east corer of St Andrew Square in the New Town. A City Guard sentry box near the house was set upon and smashed to pieces. Edinburgh Castle, learning of the disturbance, lit a beacon fire on the half moon battery, and that signalled a beacon to be lit on Calton Hill. The pre-arranged signal allowed HMS Hind, moored in Leith Docks, to dispatch a company of marines into the city. Combining forces with cavalry from the castle the mob dispersed. Provost Stirling had by then sought refuge in Edinburgh Castle. The local doctor Alexander Wood, was mistaken by the angry mob for Stirling and narrowly avoided being thrown off North Bridge due to the misunderstanding. Aftermath The Edinburgh goldsmiths decried the actions of the mob in a public statement on 7 June. There followed a series of public declarations of loyalty of various trade halls, swearing loyalty to the constitution. At a meeting held from 11 to 13 December 1792, 170 representatives met at a hall in James Court off the Royal Mile, representing various Societies of Friends from across Scotland (aka the first Friends of the People Convention). Most notable of those present was Thomas Muir of Huntershill, a Glaswegian by birth, but then an Edinburgh lawyer. Divisions in public opinion began to appear, but the majority supported the old status quo. Muir was prosecuted the following year for his part in the convention and for being the Edinburgh publisher of Thomas Paine's then controversial book \\"The Rights of Man\\". Although Thomas Muir of Huntershill is not named as one of the rioters in June, it is logical to presume he was either present or had encouraged the actions. Certainly Robert Dundas of Arniston is said to have remained in Edinburgh to watch those involved \\"like a hawk\\" and report to London his findings. Muir was the focus of all his attention, and given Dundas's position, Muir was then doomed. When Muir became trapped in Paris due to the outbreak of war he could not attend court as required, and was automatically outlawed by Dundas... ultimately being sent to Australia in punishment.House of Commons:Robert Dundas of Arniston Trivia 57 George Square bears a plaque, but to Benjamin Rush rather than Robert Dundas or the Dundas Riots.

Stendig then worked for Raymor, a distribution company that focused on modern china, glass, and accessories, and was best known for selling Russel Wright's popular \\"American Modern\\" line. Stendig focused on Raymor's less popular imported pieces from Scandinavia and Italy. Stendig left Raymor after two years to begin his own business.  Career  In 1955, Stendig connected with Finnish furniture company Asko, who invited him to Lahti, Finland, to work with the company's designers on developing marketable furniture to be imported for the American market. His first showroom was in midtown Manhattan, which opened in 1956 with a $300 loan from Paul Secon, founder of Pottery Barn. Stendig's wife Eleanore became the head of operations. En route from Finland to Czechoslovakia, Stendig stopped over in Z√ºrich, where he found a shop with Bauhaus-style chrome-and-leather furniture by three Swiss designers‚ÄîHans Eichenberger, Kurt Thut, and Robert Haussmann‚Äîthe last of whom owned and ran the shop with his brother. Its local furniture was sold only in Switzerland. Stendig became their exclusive U.S. importer, expanding to include De Sede's offerings. Stendig negotiated a formal invitation to travel to Czechoslovakia, where Thonet's factory was located. This trip yielded the exclusive right to import model no. B9 armchair, designed by Le Corbusier, and the model no. 811 side chair, often attributed to Josef Hoffmann. He agreed to guarantee the cost of U.S. production for a year, which ultimately contributed to widespread appreciation of both designs in the American market. In 1960, Stendig met Dino Gavina at a design conference in Z√ºrich. Through Gavina, Stendig gained access to Italian manufacturers. He represented Poltronova, which produced designs by Archizoom; Gae Aulenti, Ettore Sottsass, Superstudio, and Massimo and Lella Vignelli.Viladas, Pilar. \\"Page Turner.\\" New York Times Magazine, 2010. 102.

Gavina gave Stendig exclusive distribution of the chair and two other Breuer chairs. Gavina's company was acquired by Knoll in 1968 and Stendig lost his exclusivity. He then discovered Gufram and began importing the pop designs of Guido Drocco and Franco Mello and Studio 65, icons of the Anti-Design movement in Italy.

History =Founding and early growth= Delta Phi Kappa was founded in 1869 at the University of Deseret (now University of Utah) as a debating society called Delta Phi; it disappeared in 1904. Stephen G. Covey and Elmer Jenkins, two LDS Church returned missionaries organized a club for returned missionaries. The goal of the club was to help each other keep \\"the high and worthy ideals of manhood which became a servant of the Master.\\" Covey and Jenkins described the club idea to president of the University of Utah, John A. Widtsoe. Widstoe approved the club and counseled Covey and Jenkins about how to create the club. The club had to open their membership to former missionaries of all faiths in order to obtain approval from the Board of Regents. Specifically, the club was open to those who had served at least a six-month mission for any Christian denomination, or was attending a school of divinity and had done enough religious service to be equivalent to a six-month mission. The club was established as the \\"Friars Club\\" for returned missionaries of the LDS Church on November 24, 1920. The three official founding members of the club were Covey, Scott Partridge, and Donald Daynes. Because of Widtsoe's contributions to the establishment of the Friar's Club, he was known as the club's foster father. Covey was elected as the club's first president. The club's symbol was Friar Tuck and the club's colors were orange and black. Elva Chipman and Sadye Eccles were the only women to join the fraternity, as the membership was restricted to men after its first year due to the lack of returned female missionaries. In 1922, in response to the Friars Club, some students and faculty members created the \\"Fryers Club\\", a group of \\"avowed atheists\\" in an attempt to prevent influence of the Friars Club on campus. The Board of Regents required the \\"Fryers Club\\" submit meeting notes to be inspected due to complaints from Friars Club members. The Fryers Club did not comply with the requests of the Board and was dissolved. The average membership of the Friars Club during the 1920s was over 50 members. In 1927, chapters of the Friars Club were added at Weber State College (WSC) (W Chapter) and the Utah Agricultural College (A Chapter), with Lewellyn McKay named as the first Interchapter president. Widtsoe, David O. McKay, Thomas E. McKay, Adam S. Bennion, and Richard R. Lyman were among patrons given honorary membership of the Friars Club. The Friars Club tried to convince members of the Young Doctors of Divinity Club (YDD) at Brigham Young University (BYU) to join the Friars Club. After much convincing and correspondence, the clubs were merged on the condition that the women in the YDD be permitted to exist as an auxiliary group of the Friars Club, called the YDDers. The Y chapter of the Friars Club was established at BYU in 1929. In 1930, two alumni chapters were added in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. =Merger= Bennion and the Friars Club president discussed concerns about the purpose of the club and its name. A non-religious group in New York had the same name and this would have caused confusion if the Friars Club expanded eastward. Others stated that the group was insulting to Catholics or disliked the name or the fraternity-like activities the Friars were participating in such as blackballing nominees. Alton Melville, president of the Friars, confessed to another Friar that he secretly intended the club be a social fraternity rather than a religious club. Chapter officers lobbied for a name change and merged with Delta Phi, the old debating society. The merge was approved by many alumni of Delta Phi. The Friar's Club was merged with the previous Delta Phi Society in 1931, adopting the namesake of Delta Phi and its history as the oldest fraternity in Utah. Previous members of the Delta Phi debating society were considered honorary members of the new fraternity. After the merger, the fraternity began selecting alumni as presidents rather than students. The fraternity gained members and popularity during the 1930s, but World War II sent many of its members away. Consequently, membership in all of the chapters diminished except University of Utah's chapter, whose medical and engineering students were exempted from the United States draft. After the war, membership in the chapters increased significantly. Yesharah Society, a sorority at BYU for sister missionaries, was similar in purpose to Delta Phi. =After the merger= Delta Phi was led by volunteer nation officers which brought the fraternity to other campuses and established housing for some members. The fraternity established and ran housing at Utah State University (USU), Ricks College, and University of Utah. The name was changed to Delta Phi Kappa in 1961, due to naming conflicts with an eastern fraternity also called Delta Phi. Delta Phi Kappa was not sponsored or funded by the LDS Church, but was encouraged by the LDS Church. The purpose of the fraternity was to allow returned missionaries to socially interact with other men with \\"high standards\\" and to allow them to gradually adjust to normal dating and social lives after two years of an LDS missionary lifestyle. Over ten thousand men belonged to the fraternity at the University of Utah, BYU, USU, WSC, Idaho State University, Ricks College, Branch Agricultural College at Cedar City (Southern Utah State College), and Arizona State University between 1920 and 1978. Chapters provided special sacrament meetings to wards near their campuses as well as presented spiritual programs and talent shows for local prison and mental hospitals. Other service activities included attending the temple, and helping train future missionaries of the LDS Church. =Merger and dissociation= In 1978, Delta Phi Kappa was absorbed by the LDS Church into Sigma Gamma Chi, which was open to all college aged men and not restricted to only returned missionaries. Sigma Gamma Chi was disbanded in 2011 along with Lambda Delta Sigma, the equivalent for women, which ended LDS Church-sponsored fraternities, sororities, and other social clubs.

He served as the governor of Medina in 680, during the reign of Caliph Yazid I () and later fought off attempts by the Zubayrids to conquer Syria in 684 and 685 during the reign of Caliph Marwan I. His attempted coup against Caliph Abd al-Malik () in 689 ended with his surrender and ultimately his execution by Abd al-Malik himself. Life Amr was the son of the Umayyad statesman Sa'id ibn al-As and Umm al-Banin bint al-Hakam, the sister of another Umayyad statesman, Marwan ibn al-Hakam. He was nicknamed \\"al-Ashdaq\\" (the Widemouthed). When Sa'id died in 679, al-Ashdaq became the leader of this branch of the Umayyad clan. At the end of the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (), he was governor of Mecca but was then appointed the governor of Medina at the accession of Caliph Yazid I (). When the Umayyads were driven out of Mecca during the revolt of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in 682, al-Ashdaq was ordered by Yazid to send an army against the Zubayrids in the city. Al-Ashdaq appointed Ibn al-Zubayr's brother, Amr, to lead the expedition, but the force was defeated and Amr was executed by Ibn al-Zubayr. Toward the end of 683, al- Ashdaq was dismissed, Yazid died and was succeeded by his son, Mu'awiya II. The latter was ill and died a few months later, causing a leadership crisis in the Umayyad Caliphate, which saw most of its provinces recognize Ibn al-Zubayr as caliph. When the pro-Umayyad Arab tribal nobility of Syria, chief among them the chieftain of Banu Kalb, elected Marwan ibn al-Hakam as caliph at the Jabiya summit of 684, it was stipulated that Yazid's then-young son Khalid would succeed Marwan, followed by al-Ashdaq. The latter commanded the right wing of Marwan's army during the Battle of Marj Rahit later that year, in which the Umayyads scored a resounding victory over the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi tribes of Syria. During Marwan's expedition to wrest control of Egypt from its Zubayrid governor in 685, al-Ashdaq was present and delivered an address proclaiming Marwan's sovereignty from the pulpit of the mosque in Fustat. Afterward, al-Ashdaq was dispatched by Marwan to stave off an invasion of Palestine by Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, who was attempting to conquer Umayyad Syria during Marwan's absence. He then joined Marwan and took up residence in the Umayyad capital of Damascus. The caliph remained wary of al-Ashdaq's ambitions to the caliphate, particularly due to his popularity among the Syrian Arab nobility and his close kinship to Marwan, who was his maternal uncle and paternal relative as well. Marwan resolved to avoid the potential leadership bids of al-Ashdaq and Khalid by having his sons Abd al-Malik and Abd al-Aziz, in that order, recognized by the Syrian nobility as his chosen successors. Abd al-Malik succeeded his father in late 685 but remained suspicious of al- Ashdaq. The latter did not relinquish his claims and viewed Abd al-Malik's accession as a violation of the arrangements reached in Jabiya. When the caliph left Damascus on a military campaign against Zubayrid-held Iraq in 689, al-Ashdaq took advantage of his absence to launch a revolt, seize the city and declare his right as sovereign. This compelled Abd al-Malik to abandon his campaign and address al-Ashdaq's rebellion. In the ensuing standoff in Damascus between their supporters, Abd al-Malik offered al-Ashdaq amnesty in return for his surrender, to which al-Ashdaq obliged. However, Abd al-Malik remained distrustful of al-Ashdaq and had him summoned to his palace in Damascus, where he executed him in 689/90. Family Genealogical tree of the family of Sa'id ibn al-As, a cadet branch of the Umayyad dynasty Al-Ashdaq's sons Umayya, Sa'id, Isma'il and Muhammad, all born to al-Ashdaq's wife Umm Habib bint Hurayth, were later reconciled with Abd al-Malik following the latter's victory over the Zubayrids in 692. Sa'id, who had participated in his father's revolt, subsequently migrated to Medina, then to Kufa. He became a mentor of Khalid al-Qasri, who served as governor of Iraq in 724‚Äì738. Khalid's father Abdallah had been the head of al-Ashdaq's shur·π≠a (security forces). Sa'id was later reported to have visited the court of the Umayyad caliph Yazid II in 744. Isma'il, who also participated in his father's rebellion, lived in ascetic seclusion near Medina into the beginning of the Abbasid period (post-750) and the Umayyad caliph Umar II () reportedly considered appointing him his successor for his reputed piety. He was spared execution by the Abbasid governor of Medina Dawud ibn Ali. Al-Ashdaq's daughter Umm Kulthum was also born to Umm Habib. From his wife Sawda bint al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, the sister of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, al-Ashdaq had his sons Abd al-Malik and Abd al-Aziz and daughter Ramla. He was also married to A'isha bint Muti, the sister of Abd Allah ibn Muti from the Banu Adi clan of Quraysh, who bore his sons Musa and Imran. From his Kalbite wife Na'ila bint al-Furays he had a daughter, Umm Musa. He also had children from two ummahat awlad (concubines), one of whom bore his sons Abd Allah and Abd al-Rahman and the other his daughter Umm Imran.

Conditioned behavior is a key part of substance addiction. This response has many implications. For instance, a drug user will be most tolerant to the drug in the presence of cues that have been associated with it, because such cues elicit compensatory responses. As a result, overdose is usually not due to an increase in dosage, but to taking the drug in a new place without the familiar cues, which would have otherwise allowed the user to tolerate the drug. CR include heightened pain sensitivity, and decreased body temperature, and might cause discomfort, thus motivating the drug user to continue usage of the drug. This is one of several ways classical conditioning might be a factor in drug addiction and dependence. In a classic experiment, Shepard Siegel conditioned rats with morphine. Later the rats were exposed to the same environmental stimuli that had been associated with morphine but did not receive the drug. The CR was opposite to the effects of morphine, and the rats apparently experienced hyperalgesia. Siegel suggested that compensatory CRs allow the organism to maintain a normal physiological state despite administration of a drug and that they help to explain tolerance to drugs. The conditioned compensatory response may take place only in the case of subconscious learning, as the effects of conscious expectancies may tend to be in the direction of the expectation. Therefore, conditioning may lead either to a placebo analgesic response to morphine or to a compensatory response.

The game is set during the time of King Henry VIII. Each player starts the game by facing off, shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries, and commencing the card game. Each player builds a game state representing their own England out of 12 cards face down from his own deck. Each player supplies two cards to build Avalon which resides in between each player's England, and it represents the goal of the game.

History  The church was built by Avison Terry, a leading evangelical layman and prominent citizen of Hull who was twice mayor (1827 and 1829) and once Sheriff (1813) of the city. He raised public subscriptions to pay for the construction on a site close to his home of Newland Grove at a cost of ¬£1,650. The church was consecrated by the Archbishop of York on 23 September 1833. The original St. John's building before extensions The original building was of a simple box construction with a balcony at the rear. It could house a congregation of around 500, which at the time was about the population of the local area, although average attendance was closer to 100. Initially, Saint John‚Äôs was a daughter church to Saint Mary‚Äôs in Cottingham, and services were held on Sunday afternoons to accommodate the ministers‚Äô schedules. Avison Terry, not being satisfied with this less than ideal arrangement, set out to raise further money so that St John‚Äôs could have a minister of its own. In October 1862, The Reverend John Pickford was selected by Reverend Charles Overton of St Mary‚Äôs Cottingham. In 1863, the vicarage at St John‚Äôs was completed, as well as a parish school, again by funds raised by Avison Terry. Avison Terry died in 1866, and was buried in the vaults which then existed beneath the church. Later modifications to the building removed the vaults and his grave is now found in the churchyard close to the south side of the church building. In 1881 the Reverend Joseph Malet Lambert was appointed vicar of Saint John‚Äôs, and remained with the church for 30 years. He was instrumental in expanding the original building and added the chancel to the east in 1893. In 1902 more significant works were carried out, extending the nave westward, removing the balcony and adding a north aisle separated from the nave by an arcade of six stone arches. The burials in the vaults were removed to the churchyard and the floor level lowered, and the windows changed from a tall narrow design to wider arched structures. A creche and office rooms were added to the west end in 1958, and the exterior of the building remains much as it was then. In 2013, the fixed pews were removed and the seating arrangements turned 90 degrees. A screen, projector, cameras for streaming the services and a new sound system were installed blending the original architecture with 21st century congregational needs and evangelical belief and practice.  Present day  The most recent incumbent, the Reverend Melvin Tinker, served as Vicar from 1994 to 2020. He was one of the founding members of the Evangelical group REFORM and is a well-known international speaker and author. By 2020 the church had over 500 people (including 100 children) and was known for having a strong Bible expository ministry and developing various evangelistic tools to foster Gospel outreach. The congregations were multi-ethnic and diverse in composition with a vibrant student work linked to the neighbouring Hull University. The leadership team included two associate ministers, the Reverend Scott Mackay and the Reverend Peter Birnie. In August 2020 Melvin Tinker resigned his post entering into retirement from the Church of England. A network of independent Anglican churches entitled 'Christ Church Network' Hull, was then formed out of the St John's congregations with the vast majority (over 550 people) joining the new network under the senior leadership of Scott Mackay. Services at St John's Church are to resume from 4 October, under the leadership of interim vicar, the Reverend Canon Erik Wilson.

The Banu Abs were based in the Qassim region of Najd in central Arabia. Under Zuhayr's leadership in circa 550, the Ghatafan became a powerful force in Arabia. He was also able to bring the Hawazin under his command. However, the fortunes of the Banu Abs declined considerably when Zuhayr was killed by the chieftain of the Banu 'Amir, Khalid ibn Ja'far al-Kilabi. Zuhayr's son Qays took over leadership of the tribe during the war of Dahis between the Banu Abs and the rest of the Ghatafan led by Hudhayfa ibn Badr of the Banu Fazara. A fourth-generation, direct descendant of Zuhayr, Wallada bint al-Abbas al-Absiyya, married the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685‚Äì705) and gave birth to the later Umayyad caliphs al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715) and Sulayman (r. 715‚Äì717).Elad 2016, p. 134.

He founded the company in 2011, while working as a corporate lawyer. Career Woolverton became a lawyer after studying at the University of California Los Angeles and then at Columbia Law School. Woolverton began his law career working as a corporate lawyer in Los Angeles, California. In his free time, he took improv classes, read screenwriting books, and did standup at open mics in coffee shops, telling bad jokes. The idea for Woolverton's low-calorie alternative to ice cream came about because of restrictions he made to his diet to manage his blood sugar levels. Instead of sugary treats, he'd have a bowl of Greek yogurt with fruit and stevia. Eventually, he began to consider selling and scaling his ice cream. After a year of trying to make the taste and the consistency of the ice cream, Woolverton began selling Halo Top to stores. In 2012, he launched his product. Woolverton and his business partner, Doug Bouton, funded the venture from personal savings and with the help of friends & family. Woolverton used social media marketing as one of the main marketing strategies, sending vouchers to influencers in the health and fitness industry. The research group, Mintel, stated that this strategy has been a key component behind its success. Whole Foods became the first major company to agree to carry Halo Top, mainly in the Bay area. This connection allowed Halo Top Creamery to expand to other regions in the United States through partnerships with other Whole Foods regions. While the expansion of the brand was good news, the move was costing the business financially - namely, the slotting fee that most retailers charged. Having only raised $500,000 up to this point with no outside investment, the company was only running on a month to month basis. The situation was dire enough that Woolverton applied for a predatory loan during this period but was rejected. In 2014 Sprouts removed Halo Top Creamery from 200 of their stores, and production failures added to the financial problems. Woolverton and Bouton secured $1 million in funding from angel investors and CircleUp in 2015. In 2015, this success and promotion led to Halo Top having to rebrand. In 2016 a GQ reporter ate nothing but Halo Top Creamery for ten days. The article went viral and gave the brand much-needed exposure away from just health and fitness. By 2017, Halo Top had grown to annual sales of $342.2 million. Personal life Woolverton currently resides in Los Angeles, California.

A psychological construct is a label for a domain of behaviors. Behavioral sciences use constructs such as conscientiousness, intelligence, political power, self-esteem, and group culture. For example, if a student sees another sitting in a classroom before an examination biting her nails, the interpretation might be that she is experiencing test anxiety. In that case, test anxiety is a construct for the behavior that is observed. A construct is a hypothesized cause for a certain behavior. A construct derives its name from the fact that it is a mental construction, derived from scientific process: observing natural phenomena, inferring the common features of those observations, and constructing a label for the commonality or the underlying cause. A construct derives its scientific value from the shared meaning it represents for different people. If a construct is clearly articulated and the phenomena it encompasses are clearly defined, it becomes a useful conceptual tool that facilitates communication.

Native to the Dari√©n Gap on the border between Colombia and Panama, it grows from tall with large, deeply-divided leaf blades. It has been described as \\"striking\\", \\"spectacular\\" and \\"beautiful\\" by taxonomists. Although known by local mule drivers, it was first collected in April 2013 by Sa√∫l Hoyos, and described scientifically by Colombian palm experts Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal who named the genus Sabinaria after their daughter. Despite being locally abundant, the limited range occupied by the species makes it vulnerable to habitat destruction. Description Leaf of Sabinaria magnifica. Sabinaria magnifica is a single-stemmed palm tree with palmately- compound leaves. The trunk is tall and in diameter. Leaves are borne at the end of a long petiole; the combined length of the leaf sheath and petiole averages . Trees bear 20 to 35 leaves which are between in diameter. The leaves of S. magnifica are deeply divided in two almost to the base of the leaf blade, giving a butterfly-like appearance. They were described by British palm systematists William J. Baker and John Dransfield as \\"spectacular\\" and the most distinctive character of the genus. Unlike other members of the tribe Cryosophileae (which tend to have bisexual flowers), S. magnifica is monoecious‚Äîit produces both male and female flowers. The male flowers are borne on the ends of the inflorescence while the female flowers are closer to the base and are surrounded by large bracts. The inflorescences are borne between the leaves on a peduncle that is at least long. The flowers are whitish; male flowers are long and wide, while the female flowers are long and about wide. The immature fruit are green and become yellowish-green as they mature. The ripe fruit are black. They are about long and wide. The seeds are long and wide. Taxonomy = Scientific discovery = Although known by local mule drivers, the species was first collected by Sa√∫l Hoyos, a Colombian botanist, in April 2013. Hoyos sent pictures of it to palm systematist Rodrigo Bernal. Based on the pictures, Bernal concluded that the palm was probably a new species in the Cryosophileae, and possibly an entirely new genus. This opinion that was shared by Bernal's partner and collaborator Gloria Galeano who described it as \\"the most beautiful of all Colombian palms\\". A few months later Bernal, Galeano, Hoyos and Norman Echavarr√≠a returned to the site where Hoyos had encountered the species and where they were able to collect additional samples, including flowers and fruit. These allowed them to conclude that this was a new genus. Ten days after returning from the expedition, the manuscript formally describing the new genus, Sabinaria, and the species S. magnifica was submitted to the journal Phytotaxa, and was formally published in November 2013. Bernal and Galeano named the genus after their daughter, Sabina. The specific epithet is a reference to the \\"strikingly beautiful aspect of the palm\\"; they originally intended to name the species after Sa√∫l Hoyos, but after concluding that \\"the name this unique palm would be given might be vital for its future conservation\\", they decided on magnifica. Using morphological characteristics, they placed the genus in the tribe Cryosophileae and commented on its similarity to the genus Itaya. A phylogenetic study by √Ångela Cano and collaborators confirmed the placement of Sabinaria in the Cryosophileae based on four nuclear genes and the matK plastid gene. This analysis also identified Itaya as a sister genus to Sabinaria. =Evolutionary history= √Ångela Cano and collaborators concluded that the ancestors of the Cryosophileae and its sister taxon, the tribe Sabaleae probably evolved in North America during the late Cretaceous and dispersed to South America by the Eocene, where Sabinaria evolved. Distribution Sabinaria magnifica is one of two palm species endemic to the Dari√©n Gap on the border between Colombia and Panama. It was first discovered near the base of the Serran√≠a del Dari√©n in Colombia in premontane moist forest-warm transition (according to the Holdridge life zone system), and was subsequently recorded on the Panamanian side of the border. Although locally common, the limited range makes the species vulnerable to habitat destruction; between 2014 and 2015 a portion of the forest where the species was first discovered was cleared for agriculture.

The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast have whaling traditions dating back millennia, and the hunting of cetaceans continues by Inuit (mostly beluga and narwhal, but also the subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale). Commercial whaling was one of the stimuli for Europeans to explore the sub- Arctic and Arctic, possibly as early as the 14th century. By the late 20th century, watching whales was a more profitable enterprise than hunting them. Pre-contact Stranded whales, or drift whales that died at sea and washed ashore, provided useful resources such as meat, blubber (rendered into oil) and bone to coastal communities. Eponymous coastal features include Drift Whale Bay within Brooks Peninsula Provincial Park on the Pacific Coast of Vancouver Island. Whaling on the Pacific Northwest Coast goes back millennia, and is deeply intertwined with the culture of the indigenous peoples there. The chiefs built private sacred places, called whalers' washing houses, where they could ritually purify themselves. The best known of these is the Yuquot Whalers Shrine, associated with the great Mowachaht chief Maquinna. 16th century Red Bay, Labrador The Basque whalers reached Newfoundland and Labrador early, possibly a century before Columbus. Certainly they were established by second quarter of the 16th century, when the Basques were hunting in the Strait of Belle Isle, between the island of Newfoundland and the mainland of Labrador. They hunted the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale, although the voyages had begun in search of cod. 17th, 18th, 19th centuries The Basque \\"fisheries\\" ended by 1697. Aguilar, A. 1986. A Review of Old Basque Whaling and its Effect on the Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic. Reports of the International Whaling Commission (special issue) 10: 191-199. By this point the British whaling industry was picking up, with ships sent predominantly from Scotland and London. Those that set sail for the Northern whale fishery went either east to the European Arctic (mostly whaling stations on Spitzbergen) or west past Greenland and into what is now the Canadian Arctic. By the 1650s they were whaling in Davis Strait, next to Baffin Island. The Industrial Revolution massively increased the demand for whale oil, which led to more whaling all over the world. In Arctic Canada it was a significant way for Inuit people to come into contact with the outside world. The Hudson's Bay Company opened trading posts such as Great Whale River in northern Quebec (1820), where products of the commercial whale hunt were processed. 20th century Beluga and narwhal catches In the twentieth century there was a commercial whaling industry, small by global standards, in British Columbia, as evidenced by place names such as Blubber Bay. When Coal Harbour closed its whaling station in the late 1960s, the industrial killing of whales in Canada was over. By that point, marine entrepreneurs had moved on to hunting orcas (killer whales) for live capture, to be displayed in aquaria. That lasted about a decade, till public pressure put an end to it in the mid 1970s. Whaling by First Nations continues to the present. Data for narwhals start in 1972, with 600 narwhals killed per year in the 1970s, dropping to 300‚Äì400 per year in the late 1980s and 1990s, and rising again since 1999. Incomplete counts of beluga hunts, for the Beaufort Sea, begin in 1960, with 14 to 212 belugas killed per year. Parts of Nunavut and Nunavik are covered starting in 1996, with 400-700 killed per year.Sources for Canadian Beluga hunts by location and year: ;Beaufort Sea: *1960‚Äì1969 *1970‚Äì99 Includes struck and lost. *2000‚Äì2012 Includes struck and lost. *2013‚Äì15 includes struck and lost. *2014 ;Nunavut: *Arviat ;Numavik, Quebec: *1996‚Äì2002 *2003‚Äì16 Bowhead whales are also taken: in northwestern Canada one each in 1991 and 1996, and in northeastern Canada one each in 1994, 1996 and 1998. Pour la suite du monde, a classic of Canadian cinema, is a 1963 documentary in which the film producers persuaded the inhabitants of a St Lawrence island to try once again to catch a beluga, something they had not done for decades. The animal is trapped live, and transported by truck to an aquarium in New York City. According to the CBC, \\"Commercial hunting continued until 1959, and sport hunting lasted another two decades.\\" Canada withdrew from the International Whaling Commission following the 1986 vote for a moratorium. 21st century Aboriginal whaling takes place in the Canadian Arctic. Canadians kill about 600 narwhals per year. They kill 100 belugas per year in the Beaufort Sea, 300 in northern Quebec (Nunavik), and an unknown number in Nunavut. The total annual kill in Beaufort and Quebec areas varies between 300 and 400 belugas per year. Numbers are not available for Nunavut since 2003, when the Arviat area, with about half Nunavut's hunters, killed 200-300 belugas, though the authors say hunters resist giving complete numbers. Bowhead whales are still hunted in northeastern Canada: two to four per year. Harvested meat is sold through shops and supermarkets in northern communities where whale meat is a component of the traditional diet. Hunters in Hudson's Bay rarely eat beluga meat. They give a little to dogs, and leave the rest for wild animals. Other areas may dry the meat for later consumption by humans. An average of one or two vertebrae and one or two teeth per beluga or narwhal are carved and sold. One estimate of the annual gross value received from Beluga hunts in Hudson Bay in 2013 was for 190 belugas, or per beluga, and for 81 narwhals, or per narwhal. However the net income, after subtracting costs in time and equipment, was a loss of per person for belugas and per person for narwhals. Hunts receive subsidies, but they continue as a tradition, rather than for the money, and the economic analysis noted that whale watching may be an alternate revenue source. Of the gross income, was for Beluga skin and meat, to replace beef, pork and chickens which would otherwise be bought, was received for carved vertebrae and teeth. was for Narwhal skin and meat, was received for tusks, and carved vertebrae and teeth of males, and was received for carved vertebrae and teeth of female Narwhals. Cetaceans are not hunted elsewhere, although humans kill them via ship strike, fishing net entanglement, bio-accumulated pollution, and so on. This means some populations are not only endangered, but not recovering, as for example the talismanic Southern resident killer whales. On the other hand, the modern industry of whale watching is a booming business on Pacific and Atlantic coasts and in the St Lawrence estuary. See also *John R.

In December 2018 and 2019, she won the championship at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lockwood and her horse, Sister, have qualified for the NFR three times in her years in professional rodeo, in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Lockwood has been competing in rodeo since adolescence, winning awards through high school and college in both barrel racing and breakaway roping, as well as professional rodeo. Her horse, Sister, won the Women's Professional Rodeo Association/American Quarter Horse Association (WPRA/AQHA) Barrel Racing Horse of the Year Award in 2018. Early life Hailey Kinsel was born on October 3, 1994, in Cotulla, Texas, to Dan and Leslie Kinsel (n√©e Walker). Her mother, who has an equestrian background, is a former Miss Rodeo Texas of 1980. Her parents own a commercial beef cattle ranch, and were instrumental in fostering her interest in rodeo and horses because they both had rodeo backgrounds. They encouraged her and her brother to compete. However, Lockwood initially preferred to compete as a gymnast. When she turned 11, she became interested in barrel racing and changed her focus. Career At 13, Lockwood received her first dedicated barrel horse, who \\"couldn't be used on the ranch\\". As Lockwood says, \\"Josey was off the track, and she was one that mom and I kind of brought along together.\\" Lockwood competed with Josey in junior high school and high school, but stopped when the mare became injured. Lockwood then competed on a gelding named Thunder Stones, nicknamed TJ, throughout college rodeo. She also had TJ when she filled her professional permit for the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA). Lockwood and her mother bought her current barrel racing horse Sister as a filly. Sister was one of many horses they bought young and trained, while they used others to fill gaps. Sister was one they trained from the ground up. Sister was sired by Sherry Cervi's PC Frenchman's Hayday, nicknamed Dinero. \\"We bought her because we had an older half sister to her out of a Royal Shake Em mare that we just loved. We tried to find that lineage and follow that bloodline and thought, 'Well, if she's crossed with Dinero, this could be good'\\", said Lockwood. Lockwood turned professional by joining the WPRA in 2015. Barrel racing is sanctioned by the WPRA, while other rodeo events are sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). The barrel racing events, however, take place at PRCA rodeos, alongside events such as bull riding and tie-down roping. All of the championship rodeo events are held together (except steer roping which has its own finals event, the National Finals Steer Roping), at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) held at the Thomas & Mack Center, in Las Vegas, Nevada, in December. In July 2017 at the Days of '47 Rodeo she started winning major rodeos. She won the RFD-TV's The American Rodeo in 2017 and came in second in 2018. She qualified for the NFR in 2017, 2018, and 2019. 2015 and 2016 seasons In 2015, Lockwood finished ranked 19th in the WPRA Rookie of the Year standings with $4,880. In 2016, Lockwood won the Elizabeth Stampede (Colorado), the Longview PRCA Rodeo (Texas), the Crockett Lions Club PRCA Rodeo (Texas), and the Hugo PRCA Rodeo (Oklahoma). 2017 season The Kinsel family bought Sister at age 2 while Lockwood was in her college freshman year; she and her mother took turns riding her. They experienced issues training Sister, but the mare also had some natural abilities. They waited until Sister was 5 years old to start her in the futurity. Her second year running barrels was 2017 and was Lockwood's first year qualifying for the NFR. In the mare's first 14 months of competition, she won $35,000. She was instrumental in Lockwood first professional win in Elizabeth, Colorado, in 2016 and in her win in Denver, Colorado, in the 2017 season. Lockwood won a gold medal at the Days of '47 Rodeo (Salt Lake City, Utah), and won the West of the Pecos Rodeo (Texas). She finished in second place at the Tri-State Fair and Rodeo (Amarillo, Texas), the Dinosaur Days Rodeo (Vernal, Utah), the Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo (Oklahoma), and the San Patricio County PRCA Rodeo (Sinton, Texas), and tied for second place at the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo (Denver). Other than barrel racing, she also competed at the 2017 WPRA World Finals in Breakaway Roping. Starting with the Semi-Finals on Wednesday, February 15, Lockwood competed at the \\"world's richest one-day rodeo\\", The American Rodeo, for the first time. The rodeo is held in Arlington, Texas, at the AT&T; Stadium. That day of semi-finals, Lockwood and Sister scored a time of 14.08 seconds to win against a total of 30 barrel racers to move on to the second round of semi-finals on Thursday. Lockwood and Sister won the Semi-Finals and advanced to the Finals on Sunday, February 19, where the ultimate possible prize was $1 million. Lockwood just needed a clean run to take second place, but she and Sister went all out and won first, despite taking risks. Two other barrel racers knocked over their barrels in the short round, aiding Lockwood's win. Lockwood won her event with a time of 14.4 seconds in the long round, and moved in the top four to the short round. She and Sister scored a time of 14.689 in the short round to win the event and also the top time of the event. Three competitors from three different events split a million-dollar prize. Lockwood, Cody DeMoss, and Sage Kimzey each received $333,333.33 from what is called the side pot, as well as $100,000 for winning their respective events. The three participants each won $433,333.33 that day. Lockwood had qualified for The American Rodeo at the Better Barrel Races Regional (BBR) Qualifier in Glen Rose in November 2016. Due to that qualification, Lockwood became the first BBR/The American Qualifier to split the $1 million payout. Because Lockwood holds a BBR membership, her total winnings for $433,333.33 is a world record for members. \\"I didn't wear the right mascara for this,\\" said Lockwood after her win. \\"God is good, and my horse is awesome.\\" Sister helped Lockwood win almost $500,000 in the last couple of months leading up to and including The American. =National Finals Rodeo= Lockwood qualified for the NFR at the 7th position in the World Standings to make the top 15 competitors who qualify for the trip to the finals in December at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. She finished 2nd in the World Standings to become the Reserve World Barrel Racing Champion after 10 days of 10 go-rounds in the finals. Lockwood set a new arena record for the third go-round with a time of 13.11 seconds. She set a new earnings record for the NFR by winning $189,385 in barrel racing over the entire 10 days of competition. She placed sixth in the NFR Average by winning 4 rounds out of 10 total and placing 8 out of the 10 total rounds. For 2 of the 10 rounds, Lockwood finished just short of winning money due to knocking over a barrel. However, this did not stop her from being the high-money earner with $189,385. 2018 season In February, Lockwood competed at the AT&T; Center, in the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo in Texas. Lockood and Sister swept Bracket 1 to start the Semifinals as the high money winners and finish as the same. They won $7,134 in their bracket. The first round of the SemiFinals won her $2,230. When they competed on Wednesday night, their run was almost perfect, garnering them a time of 13.60 seconds. They broke the arena record of 13.67 seconds set by Sydni Blanchard in 2013. Lockwood said it was special because she grew up attending this rodeo, which was nearby her childhood home. She won the Sanders County Fair and PRCA Rodeo (Plains, Montana), the Fallon County Fair and Rodeo (Baker, Montana), the That Famous Preston Night Rodeo (Idaho), the Home of Champions Rodeo (Red Lodge, Montana), the Black Hills Roundup (Belle Fourche, South Dakota), the West of the Pecos Rodeo (Texas), and the Clovis Rodeo (California). She finished second at the RodeoHouston and the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo. She had a big win at Calgary Stampede in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, of $121,000, for which $71,000 does not count towards the World Standings. She also won a large prize at the Days of '47 Cowboy Games and Rodeo in Salt Lake City, Utah, totaling $53,200. This season, Sister earned more than $1 million in her career, including significant money for winning both the Calgary Stampede and the Days of '47 Cowboy Games and Rodeo. Lockwood says \\"She really is that fast and that athletic, and I can't take credit for that. Some horses just have it, and she has that 'it' factor.\\" =2018 National Finals Rodeo= At the 60th NFR on Saturday, December 15th, Lockwood won her first World Barrel Racing Champion title. She and NFR Average winner Carman Pozzobon accepted their gold buckles and saddles in front of an audience of 17,150 in the stadium that evening. Lockwood finished the 10-day competition with a WPRA record $350,700 in season earnings. \\"Oh man, it was amazing\\", she said. \\"Everyone up there is so deserving, and they're heroes of mine. It was definitely surreal and was pretty awesome\\".2018 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì 2018 World Champion, p. 7. Lockwood had the title locked up after 9 rounds, so she gave her primary horse Sister a rest by riding her older backup horse TJ in round 10 on Saturday, who kept her in the Average. She passed going for the (RAM) Top Gun Award because she said Sister owes her nothing. Lockwood's seventh-place finish in the NFR Average earned her $11,423. Lockwood's total winnings of $350,699.83 also outdistanced second-place finisher Jessica Routier's total winnings of $251,704.23 for the championship by $98,996 for the win. 2019 Season =2019 National Finals Rodeo= At the National Finals Rodeo at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lockwod and her horse Sister won the World Barrel Racing Championship for the second time.

Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year. The central plaza history The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain. The Catholic Church in the plaza The name of the church located in the plaza is . Its construction began in 1776 and was completed in 1783. It was remodeled in 1855. One of its towers collapsed during the 1918 San Ferm√≠n earthquake and the facade was changed when reconstructed. Its last remodeling was in 1971.

Over the course of those months, Pardo had nine known victims. These events led to his arrest and conviction for 8 counts of First Degree Murder in the mid 1980s which he received the death penalty for, and ultimately his execution in December 2012.  Early life and police career  Pardo was born in New York. According to USA Today, Pardo was \\"a former Boy Scout and Navy veteran, [who] began his law enforcement career in the 1970s with the Florida Highway Patrol, graduating at the top of his class at the academy. He was fired from that agency in 1979 for falsifying traffic tickets. He was soon hired by the police department in Sweetwater, a small city in Miami-Dade County.\\"  Criminal career and trial  After some brushes with law enforcement, including one incident involving lying to investigators, his position at the Sweetwater Police Department was terminated. In January 1986, Pardo killed his first two victims, Mario Amador and Roberto Alonso, with a .22 caliber Ruger pistol as he \\"ordered the men to the ground, then pumped bullets into each of their heads,\\" police reported Pardo also shot the two victims in the torso. Later that month, he killed a Haitian man, Michael Millot, who he believed to be a police informant. In February 1986, he killed two more victims, Luis Robledo and Ulpiano Ledo, during a robbery of their home. Pardo had four victims in April 1986 in two separate incidents: two, Fara Quintero and Sara Musa, were killed over an argument about a pawned ring worth $50; two others, Ramon Alvero and Daisy Ricard, were killed as Alvero failed to show up to several drug deals. Pardo was apprehended in New York City, found in a hospital with a bullet in his foot that matched those found in his final victims. Pardo maintained until his death that his mission was to rid Florida of its drug culture by killing, one by one, or in his cases, two by two, active sellers and buyers of drugs, admitting to at least six of the nine murders. During his trial, against the advice of his attorneys, Pardo took the witness stand in self-defense. During this portion of the trial, Pardo claimed \\"I am a soldier, I accomplished my mission and I humbly ask you to give me the glory of ending my life and not send me to spend the rest of my days in state prison.\\" Pardo \\"acknowledged that he killed all nine victims, but claimed that all nine victims were drug dealers who had no right to live and that he was doing society a favor.\\" Prosecuting attorney David Waxman, on the other hand, maintained that Pardo was a \\"cold-blooded killer\\" and, according to the Clark County Prosecutor's site, \\"The State presented the case that Pardo and Garcia were drug dealers and were eliminating the competition.\\" He was executed in Florida on December 11, 2012 by lethal injection, and was pronounced dead at 7:47 P.M. Manuel Pardo Jr. spent a total of 26 years on death row before his execution.  In popular culture  In the 2015 top-down shooter video game Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, one of the playable characters is an unhinged and violent Miami Police Department homicide detective named Manny Pardo, who uses his authority to go on violent rampages and get away it. Pardo is established to be seeking attention and recognition for his crimes over other violent criminals making the top headlines in Miami, who the player also controls throughout the story. Over the course of the game, Detective Pardo is gradually revealed to be a serial killer dubbed by the press as the \\"Miami Mutilator\\" who investigates his own crimes. When Manny Pardo does not initially receive the media attention he craves as a murderer, Pardo escalates the brutality of his killings, in an effort to have his crimes dominate the news cycle like these other three major stories involving more massacres by animal mask wearing vigilantes, the trial of the now notorious masked contract killer who was the main protagonist in the first Hotline Miami, and an escalating bloody gang war between the Russian Mafia and the Colombian cartel.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami_2%3A_Wrong_Number#Plot There has been speculation that Dexter Morgan, a fictional serial killer and vigilante who works as a forensics technician at the Miami Police Department, was inspired in part by Pardo due to their resemblance.Manuel Pardo: The Real DexterThe Real ‚ÄòDexter‚Äô: Did Manuel Pardo Inspire Showtime Serial Killer?

She is best known for her archive, Archivo Ana Victoria Jim√©nez, which contains photographs, posters, and flyers that demonstrated or related to women activism in Mexico.  Biography  Ana Victoria Jim√©nez was born in Mexico City, on August 31, 1941. Her parents were Ana Alvarez and Ramiro Jim√©nez. She began her activism at the young age of seventeen.Abelleyra, Ang√©lica. \\"Por el derecho a la felicidad: Entrevista con Ana Victoria Jim√©nez.\\" Nierika: Revista de Estudios de Arte In her house, during nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, she and her family read many journals by Pol√≠tica and other newspapers, that informed on the political climate; she also had many friends that she would attend political conferences with. As most famously known for her photographs and archive, Jim√©nez's educational training did not involve photography. After finishing her studies at Sindicato de Pintores y Escultores, she worked as a typesetter in a print shop. Her job was to check for any spelling errors found in linotype presses. Years later, she worked for IBM where she spent much of her time utilizing a portable machine. Jim√©nez's activism and militancy was first enacted through the Communist Party in Mexico and later on, in Mexico's feminist movement. It wasn't until her involvement with the women's movement, that Jim√©nez began her work as a photographer and archivist. After participating and documenting in the movement for many years, Jim√©nez decided to begin her work as an independent editor, co-author, and desktop publisher. She focused her writing on the history of the Union Nacional de Mujeres Mexicanas (UNMM), its members, and artists. She also wrote through many Mexican journals, newspapers, and books, concentrating on themes such as: domestic work, women biographies, and campesinas (women peasants).ANTIVILO PE√ëA, Julia. ‚ÄúARTE FEMINISTA LATINOAMERICANO Rupturas De Un Arte Pol√≠tico En La Producci√≥n Visual.‚Äù UNIVERSIDAD DE CHILE FACULTAD DE FILOSOFIA Y HUMANIDADES ESCUELA DE POSTGRADO, 2013, repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/114336/Antivilo Julia_2013.pdf. In 2011, her documentations of the women's movement gained recognition and was exhibited as an archive at, the Universidad Iberoamericana. Since then, Ana Victoria Jim√©nez has formed part of important exhibitions in the United States and has continued her work as an editor and author in Mexico. Jim√©nez did not attain a high school diploma. However, she did attend, Sindicato de Pintores y Escultores, in Mexico, where she studied graphic arts. It was not until later of her photography career that she took an instructional class with well known photographer, Alicia D'Amico. In 1974-75, Jim√©nez decided to continue her photography education by enrolling in classes that would train her on technique.  Activism  = Communism = Jim√©nez has been dedicated to activism since the 1960s. In the beginning of her activist career, she formed part of the Communist Party. Within the Communist Party, specifically the Communist Youth League, she was able to become the secretary of the party's, Comit√© Central (The central Committee). Also, during her participation in a communist party named, Central Campesina Independiente and Frente Electoral del Pueblo (Central Peasant Independent and Electoral Front of the People), Jim√©nez was arrested and detained during an operation by Mexico City police, which was organized with the intent of stopping radical activity by communist. Furthermore, due to her position as the secretary of the Comit√© Central, Jim√©nez was able to travel to the Soviet Union, and other countries, that formed part of the party. = Feminist movement = Jim√©nez's active participation in Mexico's feminist movements, specifically during the post-revolution and second wave, allowed the activist to support feminist issues such as the legalization of abortion, equality, and recognition. Still considered a communist activist, Jim√©nez moved on to become member and founder of, Union Nacional de Mujeres Mexicanas (UNMM). During her time with the UNMM, she became the group's representative at the International Democratic Federation of Women (FDIM), which was stationed in Berlin. With the FDIM, Jim√©nez and others constantly worked on bulletins for the group. Then, in the late 1970s, she decided to form part of, Mujeres en Acci√≥n Solidaria (Women in Solidarity Action). After becoming part of Mujeres en Acci√≥n Solidaria (MAS), Jim√©nez's activism began to shift focus onto feminism. Gabriela Aceves Sepulveda tells us that through Mujeres en Acci√≥n Solidaria, specifically after the march towards Mexico's Mother's Monument (May 9, 1971), a march which demanded a change in the manipulation of Mother's Day and women objectification of the media, Jim√©nez actively began documenting demonstrations. Another group that Jim√©nez decided to join, in 1972, was Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres (MNM). MNM was established by Esperanza Brito de Mart√≠ and other women, whom worked in broadcasting and print media industries such as Martha de la Lama.Rosa, Mar√≠a Laura, and Soledad Novoa Donoso, editors. Compartir El Mundo: La Experiencia De Las Mujeres y El Arte. Metales Pesados, 2017. Furthering her involvement with the feminist world, Jim√©nez engaged in many feminist art collectives. Being part of feminist art collectives, according to Cecilia Fajardo-Hill, allowed Jim√©nez to question the discrimination in art that women faced. Her questioning, led her to produce work that mirrored personal experiences of women in the movement and creating exhibitions, which implemented the idea that one should challenge the patriarchy found in art. One of the feminist art organizations she became involved with was, Tlacuilas y Retrateras, which was formed after, Monica Mayer, a feminist Mexican artist, gave a workshop focusing on feminist art and soon after, many professors and staff of the university, tried to prohibit the workshop from continuing, by locking Mayer out of the halls and writing letters to the director claiming that men were being discriminated against joining.Giunta, Andrea. \\"Feminist Disruptions in Mexican Art, 1975‚Äì1987\\". After hearing of the incident, artist, historians, and activists such as, Patricia Torres, Elizabeth Valenzuela, Karen Cordero, and Nicola Coleby decided to organize and establish Tlacuilas y Retrateras.  Works  = Photography = Much of her recognized photography is those photographed during Mexican Feminist Movement. Many of Jim√©nez's images portray activist during protest and events such as the March for Decriminalizing Abortion (1977), in front of Mexico's Angel of independence, and the protest in the National Auditorium against the ideas posed by the Miss Universe contest of Mexico. During the time that Ana Victoria Jim√©nez was dedicated to photography, she sold some of her work and was even asked to create images for store catalogues. Her photos of feminist demonstrations were many times featured in the newspapers and magazines, but were not given credit. Jim√©nez claims that she decided to leave photography when she realized that it was not her line of work, unlike her work as an editor. She did however, continue capturing photos until the 1990s. Jim√©nez began to create still photography in 1978, when she began to work with Cine Mujer, a collective which was founded by Rosa Martha Fernandez and Beatriz Mar. Cine Mujer was founded in 1975 with the purpose to create films that highlighted women's issues. Within Cine Mujer, Jim√©nez captured images for many films such as, Cosas de Mujeres 1975-1978 (Women's Matters). Cosas de Mujeres's objection was to reveal the abortion restrictions that women faced. The still images, which Jim√©nez created for the film, were presented in many campaigns that tried to decriminalize abortion. Another film that Jim√©nez created with Cine Mujer was, Rompiendo Silencio (Breaking the Silence), which was released in 1979 and centered on raped women. Both films, were captured in black and white, shot with 16mm, featured interviews, fictional narrative, still photography, and statistics.Aceves, Gabriela (February 2019). \\"¬øCosas de Mujeres?\\" Feminist Networks of Collaboration in 1970s Mexico\\". Artelogie. no. 5. Gabriela Aceves claims that, Jim√©nez's still photography, showing demonstrations by feminist, contributed to placing Mexico's feminist movement in a state of credibility, and a place where they fought for global women issues. Jim√©nez's first photographic essay was, Jim√©nez: 1985. This photographic essay, narrates a story in which a woman climbs up to a tree to speak of her youth, while also portraying wishes of getting married and fulfilling her dreams. The woman of this narrative, is eventually beaten by her husband and her children are taken away from her, resulting in her becoming crazy. According to Andrea Giunta, Jimenez's purpose of this photographic essay was to shed light on the influence that religion had on women in Mexico. Other photographic essays that she created were, \\"Ensayo Sobre Todo Trabajo Domestico\\" (Essay on All Domestic Work) and Cuaderno de Tareas. Ensayo Sobre Todo Trabajo Domestico, is a photographic essay on domestic work, from 1978, containing many photographs that capture the daily lives of domestic workers. Cuaderno de Tareas, is also a project in essay form, that documents (from 1978-1981) a domestic worker; Jim√©nez shadowed a specific female domestic worker. In this project, viewers can see the pictures of the domestic worker performing her paid job, such as cleaning and washing clothes. Jim√©nez decided to highlight \\"focus\\" on the worker's hands ‚Äúas she cooked, cleaned the bathroom, washed by hand, folded clothes, wrote on her type writer, and used the sewing machine.\\" Cecilia Fajardo-Hill claims, that Jim√©nez's work in this project was intended to ‚Äúrecognize‚Äù the ‚Äúvalue of work in the home‚Äù which was an issue that many feminist wrote about during this time. Ana Victoria Jim√©nez's photographic style was highly associated with radical feminism by the end of the 1970s. According to Ana Victoria Jim√©nez, her style in photography was spontaneous when she first began to take photos. She utilized journals to read about techniques, but she did not know how to professionally handle a camera; she took photos as she pleased. After receiving some training in 1975, Jim√©nez claims to have known how to better handle a camera and take pictures. Before her training, she states that, she would capture images by a far distance because she was \\"afraid of the camera\\", but afterwards, she began to get close to the people she captured. During her time of working with collaborative groups, Jim√©nez built a dark room in her home, where she learned to develop photolithographs to produce negatives for print productions. She even experimented with photolithography to print her own photographs and works. = International Dinner Party = The International Dinner Party, was organized by Suzanne Lacy to celebrate her mentor, Judy Chicago. This exhibition was created in the context of Chicago's first exhibition. It took place at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Jim√©nez documented and participated in this exhibition, which consisted of thirty-nine ceramic dinner sculpture plates on a table, tablecloths with metal, scraps of leather, and pieces of wood. The display was forty-four meters long and was displayed to the public for three months. Aside from recognizing Judy Chicago, the exhibition was also dedicated to many outstanding women like: Elvira Trueba, Adelina Zendejas, Amalia Castillo Led√≥n and Concha Michel. = \\"El juego de la sirena tratando de romper el c√≠rculo sin fin\\" = With Tlacuilas y Retrateras, Jim√©nez photographed and participated in the organized performance, \\"La Fiesta de Quincea√±os\\", for an audience of more than two-hundred people. This performance took place at the San Carlos Academy, in downtown Mexico City. The performance was organized with the goal to analyze the event of quince√±eras, a \\"traditional celebration that marks the sexual rite of passage from girlhood to womanhood\\". The group staged performances imitating the dance usually performed by fifteen-year-old girls and their male chaperones. Other performances by Maris Bustamante, M√≥nica Mayer, Victor Lerma and Ruben Valencia formed part of \\"La Fiesta de Quincea√±os\\". Aside from photographing the event, Jim√©nez created her own board game based on the board game, Snakes and Ladders, which she titled, \\"El juego de la sirena tratando de romper el c√≠rculo sin fin'\\". She recreated the board game by utilizing her own photos. Her version of the game demonstrated the life of Mexican women as a game \\"dictated by celebrations, traditional myths, and female archetypes including the mermaid, Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz\\" and social issues (like menstruation and violence against women). = Other works = Other works she participated in were Encuentro Femenismo Arte y Mujer (1979) and the exposition of Colectiva Mujeres Artistas-Artistas Mujeres (presented in the Museo de Bellas Artes de Toluca, in 1984).

Collections  = Archivo Ana Victoria Jim√©nez = Jim√©nez's involvement in the feminist movement consisted of participating in events but, the majority was her documentation of demonstrations by the feminist. In fact, between 1964-1990, Jim√©nez was able to gather and photograph more than three-thousand of the feminist's actions and protest in photographs and documents such as flyers and posters. The collected photographs and documents, which Jim√©nez saved, came to interest a group of scholars and feminist artist in 2009. The group's objection was to bring the set of photos and documents back to the public view; their efforts to make this happen became known as the Memora Project. The Memora Project worked for many years, specifically, until 2011, to turn Jim√©nez's most recognized work into, Archivo Ana Victoria Jim√©nez. This archive of hers is located in the Biblioteca Francisco Xavier Clavigero, of the Universidad Iberoamericana, Mexico City. It was first integrated with the exhibition of ¬øMujeres? ¬øy que m√°s?: Reactivando el Archivo de Ana Victoria Jim√©nez, in 2011. The archive is a series, of over four-thousand pieces, of documented and collected photographs, flyers, and posters (collected between 1970-1990), that captured feminist protest and demonstrations in Mexico City. Gabriela Aceves Sepuvelda claims that Monica Mayer , whom was part of the Memora Project, was an important figure that helped transform Jim√©nez's collections into an archive. The archive is divided into five themes. The first theme is titled, \\"La Posibilidad de la Memoria\\" (The Possibility of Memory), which gives an introduction to the exposition and archive as a whole, and informs the viewers of the content and characteristics of the archive. The second theme of the archive is \\"De Mujeres objeto a Mu√±ecas en Acci√≥n\\" (From Women object to Dolls in Action), it explores the ways that the feminist movement shed light on many of the stereotypes attached to gender and the social and cultural effects the stereotypes has implicated. The third theme of the archive,\\"Revoluci√≥n y Rebeli√≥n, Estrategias Art√≠sticas y Culturales\\" (Revolution and Rebellion, Artistic and Cultural Strategies), focuses on specific techniques that the feminist movement utilized for dissemination and promotion. The fourth theme, \\"Diversidad de la militancia feminista\\" (Diversity of feminist militancy), highlights the complexity and diversity of the groups that have supported and been part of the feminist movement; it demonstrates the different ideologies and strategies that were utilized to reach equality of both genders in Mexico. The last theme of the archive, \\"¬øY t√∫ qu√© haces?\\" (And what do you do?), poses an important question to the public, \\"What are you doing for the discovery and accomplishment of equality for both genders?\\". It took Jim√©nez almost twenty- one years after she took her last photo, which for formes part if the archive, for a university to accept and publish her work as an archive.  Publications  = Author and editor = After her participation in the feminist movement in Mexico, Jim√©nez decided to focus on independent writing and editing publications that touched on women's issues. She also published many articles, essays, and interviews in magazines and newspapers within Mexico and other parts of Latin America. Specific magazines and newspapers she wrote for was Mujer y Arte, Revista Fem, Intervi√∫, and Siempre. *Author of photographic essay, Jim√©nez: 1985. *Author of, ‚ÄúMi primer Diario‚Äù, 1996. *Author of, \\"Familias en transformaci√≥n y c√≥digos por transformar: construyendo las propuestas pol√≠ticas de las mujeres para el c√≥digo civil taller\\", M√©xico, D.F. : Grupo de Educaci√≥n Popular con Mujeres, 1992. *Author of, Feminismo en transici√≥n con feminism, 1997. *Author of, \\"M√©xico, pa√≠s de ilusiones: √Ångel Bassols Batalla, una vida dedicada a la geograf√≠a.

Early life Houari Manar was born Houari El Madani in Oran into a family with twelve brothers and sisters. His mother was a popular meddahate singer; a traditional folk music performer at festivals and weddings. Two of his brothers, Cheb Massaro and Cheb Larbi, are also ra√Ø singers. The family moved to Marseille, France when he was four. In his youth, he was inspired, in part, by singers such as Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and Francis Cabrel. Career In 2003, Manar moved back to Algeria to begin a career as a ra√Ø singer; a form of Algerian folk music that dates back to the 1920s. He recorded two successful singles, \\"Cha dani bent nass\\" and \\"Kima ndirlek ma terdhach\\" with the Edition Saint Cr√©pain label. In 2006, he recorded his first album A√¢chkek mon traitement with Cheb Kader. The album was a blend of upbeat ra√Ø and modern pop music. Manar became widely popular throughout the Mediterranean and caused a degree of controversy during his career. In 2014, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, he was photographed kissing another man at a music venue in Algiers where he was performing, angering religious fundamentalists. The organizer of the concert had to issue an apology to those who were offended and Manar's subsequent performance was cancelled. Manar's career continued to suffer from the backlash against his flamboyant persona and thinly veiled homosexuality. In 2017, he was due to perform at an event organised by the National Office of Culture and Information to mark the sixty-third anniversary of the beginning of the Algerian War of Independence. When news of his participation was released, his upcoming performance was met with renewed controversy on social media and he was later dropped from the line-up of performers. He was subsequently banned from performing on both state and privately owned television stations in Algeria. Although some of his songs strongly alluded to his homosexuality, Manar never publicly came out as gay (though never denying it) and defended himself from critics, telling Le Monde in 2015, \\"My ra√Ø is a proper ra√Ø. Everything I sing I sing in front of families, of children and old people. I am not one of those people who sing about vulgarities. I am a respected artist.\\" Death On 7 January 2019, Manar died of a heart attack at a private clinic in Hydra while undergoing liposuction. He was 37 years old.

He has been a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors since 2019, representing District 4. Prior to joining the Board of Supervisors, Mar was a longtime labor and community activist and former Executive Director of Jobs with Justice San Francisco and the Chinese Progressive Association. He is the brother of former District 1 supervisor, Eric Mar. District 4 includes the western San Francisco neighborhoods of Central Sunset, Outer Sunset, Parkside, Outer Parkside, and Pine Lake Park.  Electoral History  After incumbent District 4 Supervisor Katy Tang declined to run for re-election in 2018, Mar filed papers to run for the District 4 seat in the November election. The election was the first District 4 election without an incumbent candidate since 2006, which was won by Ed Jew. In the months leading up to the race, the campaigns of both Mar and his primary opponent, Jessica Ho, were criticized for \\"mudslinging\\" tactices, and a paid staffer of Mar's campaign was caught tearing down a poster for Ho. Mar was elected supervisor for District 4 on November 6, 2018, receiving 10,314 first preference votes (36.29 percent of all valid votes). After allocation of preferences from eliminated candidates in San Francisco's ranked-choice voting system, Mar received 56.84 percent of final-round votes, compared to 43.16 percent for runner-up Jessica Ho, an aide to the incumbent supervisor Katy Tang.  Legislation  Education - Mar led negotiations with San Francisco Mayor London Breed to fully fund City College of San Francisco's free tuition program for ten years beginning in 2019, and negotiated a deal to provide full reserve funding for raises for San Francisco Unified School District educators. Homelessness - Mar opposes building a Navigation Center in District 4, despite fellow Supervisor Matt Haney's desire to build a Navigation Center in every district in San Francisco. Housing - Mar spearheaded multiple Board of Supervisors resolutions which denounced California State Senator Scott Weiner's SB 50 bill, which would have legalized higher density development in areas close to public transit.. Mar is both in favor of more housing, while also maintaining local control over its quality and quantity. Public Safety - Mar has called on SFPD to release aggregated demographic data on Asian-American crime victims, following an increase in hate crimes in San Francisco and several high-profile attacks on members of the Chinese community, and announced legislation requiring this data to be released annually. Electoral Reform - Mar is the author of a number of ordinances reforming San Francisco's electoral system and addressing money in politics, including 2019's Proposition F addressing pay-to-play politics, corporate contributions, and dark-money donations, and Public Financing 2.0, which tripled the impact of San Francisco's public financing program for elections.

Biography Novakoviƒá, a well-educated lawyer who lived and worked in Sremski Karlovci, was a court secretary to Metropolitan Mojsije Putnik before becoming a court agent, nominated by the Emperor to the highest organ of the Hungarian administration, the Hungarian Court Chancellery in Vienna. He was ennobled in 1791. In 1770, in response to repeated requests by Metropolitan Stevan Stratimiroviƒá of Sremski Karlovci for a Serbian printing press, authorities finally granted monopoly rights for printing of Serbian/Cyrillic books to a Viennese printer, Josef von Kurzb√∂ck. When Kurzb√∂ck died, von Novakoviƒá, at the instigation of Metropolitan Stefan (Stratimiroviƒá), bought from Kurzb√∂ck's widow Katharina the entire estate, including the former Serbian court printing house, the monopoly rights and the entire inventory of books from 1770, and from 1792 to 1795 some 70 more Serbian books were printed, mostly by important authors such as Dositej Obradoviƒá, Jovan Rajiƒá, Meletius Smotrytsky, Uro≈° Nestoroviƒá, Stefan Vujanovski, Pavel Kengelac, Avram Mrazoviƒá, Vikentije Lju≈°tina and others. Stefan Novakoviƒá established himself as an independent printer of Serbian books, greatly benefiting from an ordinance prohibiting the import of Slavic books by Serbs who were themselves excluded from importing books and the publishing business. Kurzb√∂ck and Novakoviƒá books, which gained a deservedly high reputation, were bought in Serbian lands and communities throughout the Habsburg Monarchy (and eventually the Balkan Peninsula) as a result of the Allgemeine Schul-Ordnung drafted by Johann Ignaz von Felbiger for the German- speaking part of the empire, including the Serbian (Illyrian) Military Confines. Also, these books and textbooks reached the schools of Banat and south Hungary. Both Novakoviƒá and Kurzb√∂ck employed Serbian typesetters and proofreaders, mainly young, educated men who came to study in Vienna and who were proficient in Slavonic-Serbian. Among them Stefan Vujanovski who, after the death of Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn the Younger in Russia, returned to Vienna to find employment at the Serbian/Cyrillic court printing press. In 1786, Kurzb√∂ck employed Teodor Avramoviƒá as a proofreader,Deniƒá 2004, pp. 68‚Äì69 who previously worked as a teacher in his home town of Ruma.Deniƒá 2004, pp. 62‚Äì63 Avramoviƒá compiled the German-Serbian dictionary (1791). In 1792 Novakoviƒá encouraged Jovan Rajiƒá to publish Istorija raznih slovenskih narodov, najpaƒçe Bolgar, Horvatov i Serbov (The History of Various Slavic Peoples, especially of Bulgars, Croats and Serbs), the first systematic work on the history of Croats and Serbs, which was published in 1794 in four volumes. The \\"Serbskija novini povsednevnija\\", an irregularly issued newspaper (from March to December 1791), edited by Markides Pulja of Vienna, was also printed by Kurzb√∂ck press. When Novakoviƒá took over he started printing the influential newspaper of the time, \\"Slaveno-serbskija vjedomosti\\" (1792‚Äì1794). In 1792 after von Kurzb√∂ck died, he bought Kurzb√∂ck's Serbian (Illyrian) printing house with all proprietary rights and inventory. He donated a collection of all the Serbian books he had published to the Vienna Serbian Community which became a nucleus of the communal library. Strict Austrian censorship caused book sales to fall dramatically in 1794. In 1796 Novakoviƒá sold the press and monopoly rights to the Royal University of Pest (E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University) then returned to his native Osijek, where he spent the rest of his days, and, as Pavel Josef ≈†afa≈ô√≠k wrote that Novakoviƒá was still alive in 1815, while Johann Christian von Engel (1770‚Äì1814) wrote that Novakoviƒá died in 1803. In fact, Novakoviƒá lived until 1823. In addition to a journal and a booklet of commercial content in the Serbian language, he also anonymously issued -- \\"Dissertatio brevis et sincera auctoris Hungari de genta serba perperam Rasciana dicta ejusque meritis ac fatis in Hungaria cum appendice privi niorum eidem genti elargitorum\\". The Latin text was translated into German -- \\"Kurzgefasste Abhandlung √ºber die Verdienste und Schicksale der serbischen aber racischen Nation in Hungarn, mit einem Anhange der derselben verliehenen Privilegien\\" (Concise treatise on the merits and destinies of the Serbian nation in Hungary, with an addition of the privileges conferred on them) and published.

Biography  With the encouragement of her parents, Puzzovio's career was able to develop at the early age of 12. Although there is no documentation of formal education, her artistic vocation developed under the mentorship of two artists: surrealist Juan Batlle Planas and conceptual artist Jaime Davidovich. She studied under their wing up until 1961, when she exhibited her paintings for the first time in Galeria Lirolay in her hometown of Buenos Aires. Two years later, she showcased her second exhibition, Cascaras, which she developed and French artist Germaine Derbecq curated. In 1964, she was in a selected group of around 30 artists to participate in the New Art of Argentina, or \\"New Art of Argentina\\", held by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in conjunction with the Insitituo Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires.Walker Art Center, and Instituto Torcuato Di Tella. \\"New Art of Argentina: an Exhibition Organized By: Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, And the Visual Arts Center, Instituto Torcuato Di Tella, Buenos Aires\\". Buenos Aires, 1964. Like many pop artists of the time, such as Delia Cancela and Eduardo Costa, Puzzovio blended her interest in art with fashion. Her work in this category led to the creation of Dalila Doble Plataforma (Dalila Double Platform). Until 1985, she focused on developing herself as a fashion designer by making costumes for film and theater and working directly in the fashion industry. Since the 1980s, Puzzovio has experimented with an array of artistic categories. During the 1980s and 1990s, her artistic advice was used to create several interior and architectural designs. Until the beginning of the 1990s, she also contributed to popular magazines such as Vogue, where she completed tasks as a writer, editor, and illustrator. From 1998 to present day, her artwork primarily consists of digital photographic collages, among the most notable is her work Hibridos (Hybrids). She currently works and resides in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Artworks  = Collaborative Works = Dalila Puzzovio in 1962 with her piece La Novia Abandonada In 1963, she worked alongside Germaine Derbecq to create her second exhibition Cascaras (Shells). These \\"cascaras astrales\\", or astral shells, resembled empty bodies and were made of discarded orthopedic casts and other objects.

Continuing with the use of casts as her primary medium, Puzzovio created Coronas para los habitantes no humanos from 1964 to 1998. This work, as described by Eduardo Squirru is illustrative of mortality and death; the color white representing the frailty of the human bone and the black representing the soul's darkness. In the 1960s, there was a surge of pop artists in Argentina, among them Puzzovio, Edgardo Gimenez, and Puzzovios' husband Carlos \\"Charlie\\" Squirru, whom she had met in 1962. During 1965, this artistic trio worked together on the design for a poster panel located on the corner of Viamonte and Florida StreetsHerrera, Maria Jose. Pop! La consagracion de la primavera (p.5).

Buenos Aires: Editorial de la Universidad Catolica Argentina, 2012. According to Maria Jose Herrera, rather than revealing an accurate representation of Puzzovio's physical appearance, this ideal self portrait illustrates an identity that the artist relates to; in this case, the artist identifies with the sexual body of a woman that complies with fashion standards. It was this painting that granted Puzzovio her first Premio Nacional Di Tella, an artistic award given in Argentina. Dalila Puzzovio. Doble Plataforma, 1967.

At first, their exhibition was exclusive to art galleries, such as the Centro de Arte Visuales del Instituto Di Tella, but they were eventually put on display behind the shopping windows of traditional shoe stores such as Grimoldi. Puzzovio reduplicated this object and offered it to these shoe stores for commercial use, ultimately producing a massive artworkChaves, N. et al.(1999). Dise√±o y comunicaci√≥n.

The following year, her artwork was honored through the Premio Nacional de Di Tella, which would make her a second-time winner of such award. She additionally used this artwork as the basis of El Deslumbre, an installation and performance that was showcased at arteBA, Buenos Aires' annual contemporary art fair, in 2011. This exhibition recreated the environment and atmosphere of shoe stores that originally carried her \\"arty- shoes\\".

Its population in 2010 was 2,690. As was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year. History Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Lares Pueblo was 1,450. The central plaza history is the name of the central plaza located in Lares Barrio Pueblo. The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain. The Catholic Church in the plaza The name of the church located in the plaza is . Made of wood, it was inaugurated in 1838. In 1881, it was remade based on a design by Ram√≥n Soler with stone masonry but with wooden towers and a wooden roof. Then in the 1920s it was remodeled again. The building has changed completely but the original lateral walls and the first level of its front facade also remain from the original. Sectors Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci√≥n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. The following sectors are in Lares barrio-pueblo: , and .

The W.33 had been acquired by the IJN in 1922, but wasn't popular with crews due to poor handling and limited visibility afloat.

The Marlow-Hunter 18 replaced the similar Hunter 170 in production. The design was originally marketed by the manufacturer in 2011 as the Hunter 18, but, emerging from bankruptcy, the company became Marlow-Hunter in 2012 and the design was re- designated as the Marlow-Hunter 18. Production The design was built by Hunter Marine and later Marlow-Hunter in the United States, starting in 2011 and remained in production through 2019. Design The Marlow-Hunter 18 differs form the Hunter 170 in that it has more length and more waterline length, a higher length to beam ratio and more sail area. The Marlow-Hunter 18 is a small recreational dinghy, built predominantly of fiberglass, with a balsa-cored deck and hull. The hull has a hard chine and a bow hollow. It has a cuddy space covered with a snap-fastener canvas cover for stowage. It has a fractional sloop rig, a plumb stem, an open reverse transom, a transom-hung swing-up [rudder controlled by a tiller with an extension and a folding centerboard keel. It displaces empty and can carry four people to a maximum of . The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. The boat has no provisions for mounting a motor. Factory standard equipment includes a jib and a loose-footed mainsail. Factory options include a gennaker. Operational history Writing for Sailing magazine in July 2011, famed yacht designer Robert Perry concluded at the 18, \\"I think this would be an ideal boat to use to teach kids how to sail. It has the look of a modern sport boat with its plumb stem and open transom. With the spinnaker option you should be able to get good performance out of the boat and kids can learn the full range of basic sailing skills in a boat that won't overpower them.\\" In a review for Sail magazine also in July 2011, writer Charles Doane sailed the boat with Steve Pettengill, \\"who serves as Hunter‚Äôs unofficial Director of Destructive Testing\\". They sailed the boat in winds of over with full sail and even the gennaker. Doane noted, \\"Though over-canvassed, the boat handled very well. Steering was precise, and we had no trouble keeping upright by playing the main when sailing on the wind. The controls are simple, effective and easy to handle. The high boom makes it unnecessary to duck when tacking, and a substantial centerline toerail and comfortably curved cockpit coaming make it easy to push your body out quickly to windward when heeling. The only thing lacking is a centerline hiking strap to hook your feet under, but this would be easy to retrofit.\\" After the sail he concluded, \\"I feel I can recommend this boat highly. Handled by sane people, it would be lots of fun to just knock around in. Obviously, it‚Äôs a blast to sail in the heavy stuff as well.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Hunter 146 *Hunter 170 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:2010s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Hunter Marine ","title":"Marlow-Hunter 18"},{"id":"59613519","text":"November is the second studio album by American artist SiR, released on January 18, 2018 by Top Dawg Entertainment.

It is located at a distance of circa 55 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 4636 is about 105,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on February 23, 1784. NGC 4636 lies one and a half degrees southwest of Delta Virginis. It can be viewed through a telescope at a √ó23 magnification as a bright oval glow. It is part of the Herschel 400 Catalogue.  Characteristics  The central part of NGC 4636 is circular and is surrounded by an elongated fainter envelope, containing a large number of globular clusters.Sandage, A., Bedke, J. (1994), The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies. Volume I, Carnegie Institution of Washington The galaxy has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that has been categorised as LINER or a type 1.9 Seyfert galaxy. The source of nuclear activity in galaxies is suggested to be a supermassive black hole that accretes material. NGC 4636 harbors a relatively small supermassive black hole with mass , as inferred from the bulge velocity dispersion. = Molecular gas = NGC 4636 by Hubble Space Telescope When imaged in CO(2‚Äì1) there appear molecular clouds in NGC 4636. Cloud 1 is not associated with detectable optical emission and is out of the dust extinction map field of view, while cloud 2 is centered on a dust absorption knot and aligned with a ridge in the optical line emission map. The faint NGC 4636 ALMA continuum is in good agreement with the expected emission from cold dust, which would indicate that the dust content of NGC 4636 is fairly centrally located. The associated total molecular mass is . 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) license. The ultraviolet emission of NGC 4636 exhibits O vi emission, which is a tracer of gas cooling. The measured emission indicates a cooling rate of 0.3 M‚äô yr‚àí1. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) emission was detected at 11.3 and 17 Œºm, as well as [Ne ii], [Ne iii], and [S iii] lines in the center of NGC 4636 (within re/8) using the Spitzer IRS. The far infrared emission of the galaxy, as observed by the Infrared Space Observatory is 50 times more than expected based on stellar emission alone. This strongly suggests that there is dust, probably accreted in a recent merger with a gas-rich galaxy. HŒ± observations reveal the presence of warm (T ~ 104 K) ionized gas in the inner kpc of NGC 4636. Spectra of this gas indicate irregular motion, with a typical velocity of 150‚Äì200 km/s. HŒ± maps of the galaxy core show the presence of a cavity in the distribution of the ionized gas encircled by a dense shell located at a distance of ~400 pc from the center. Again, the most plausible explanation is gas expansion caused by AGN activity. In NGC 4636, the [C ii] emission extends to a radius of ~1 kpc and is centrally peaked. The velocities inferred from the [C ii] line are consistent with those measured for the HŒ± line. Finally, NGC 4636 has an excess of cold dust, approximately cospatial with the ionized and molecular gas. As above, this dust is expected be embedded in cold gas, to be protected against rapid sputtering. The extended dust distribution originates from the ejection of cold gas by AGN activity 10 Myr ago. = Globular clusters = NGC 4636 is characterised by its large number of globular clusters, much larger than that of galaxies with similar size located not in the centre of galaxy clusters. The total number of globular clusters within a radius of 14 arcminutes is estimated to be 4,200 ¬± 120 and within 7 arcminutes is estimated to be 3,500 ¬± 170. In comparison, globular clusters orbit around Messier 87, the giant elliptical galaxy at the centre of the Virgo Cluster, and 150‚Äì200 lie in and around the Milky Way. The number of globular clusters drops abruptly at 7 and 9 arcminutes, probably indicating the edge of the galaxy. The color distribution of the globular clusters in the galaxy is bimodal, a distribution that has been observed in other galaxies too. The globular clusters are characterised based on their color as blue or red. The population of red clusters is higher. Similarly with color, the metallicity distribution is bimodal, with two peaks at [Fe/H] = ‚àí1.23(œÉ = 0.32) and ‚àí0.35(œÉ = 0.19). The ages of the globular clusters in NGC 4636 vary from 2 to 15 billion years, with a bit more than a quarter of the clusters having ages less than 5 billion years. It has been suggested that the younger clusters were formed during the merging of smaller galaxies with the elliptical galaxy. The velocity dispersion of the clusters is km/s, with the velocity dispersion of the blue clusters being slightly larger. This velocity dispersion is similar to that of Messier 60, which is, however, a brighter galaxy. Comparing the velocity dispersion of the globular clusters with the stellar one it is calculated that mass-to-light ratio is not constant, but should increase as the galactocentric distance increases, indicating the existence of an extended dark matter halo in NGC 4636. = X-ray emission = Chandra image of the core of NGC 4636 with superimposed contours of HŒ±+[N ii] emission. White crosses mark the detected CO cloud positions. NGC 4636 is one of the most luminous nearby elliptical galaxies when observed in X-rays, with estimated X-ray flux of erg/s. A hot gas corona around the galaxy was first detected by the Einstein Observatory. Based on the hot interstellar medium temperature profile, the total mass of the halo was estimated to be within a radius of 35 kpc. The percentage of non-luminous matter mass is estimated to be between 50% and 80% of the total galactic mass, implying an exceptionally low baryon fraction in NGC 4636 and the presence of a large dark matter halo. The halo of NGC 4636 has some unique features. Observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed symmetric, 8 kpc long structures within the halo that look like spiral arms. The arms are about 30 percent hotter than the surrounding gas cloud. The arms form the rim of two large ellipsoid bubbles of hot gas. One more bubble-like feature has been detected about 2 kpc south of the northeastern arm. A weak radio source, elongated in the NE‚ÄìSW direction, connects the NE and SW bubbles. These large bubbles are likely the result of shocks generated by the AGN jets. It is possible that the bubbles have different ages, generated by different AGN outbursts, as indicated by the presence of radio-emitting plasma in one cavity, while the others are radio- quiet. NGC 4636 has an X-ray-bright core, having a radius of ~1 kpc. The core shows a central cavity surrounded by a bright edge. Interestingly, the small X-ray cavity surrounds the ~1 kpc radio jet detected at 1.4 GHz and is likely generated by the jet. Thus, the X-ray and radio observations point to a scenario in which gas may be currently outflowing in the central kpc of NGC 4636. There are 318 point X-ray sources in the field of NGC 4636. About 25% of them are identified as background sources. 77 of the sources match the location of globular clusters. No correlation was found between the X-ray luminosities of the matched point sources and the luminosity or color of the host GC candidates. The other point sources are low-mass X-ray binaries.  Supernovae  Two supernovae have been observed in NGC 4636, the first being SN 1939 A. It was a type Ia supernova whose maximum magnitude was estimated to be 11.9.List of Supernovae IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. Retrieved 29 December 2015. It was discovered by Fritz Zwicky. In January 2020 another type Ia supernova, SN 2020ue, was discovered by Koichi Itagaki.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 4636 is the foremost galaxy of the galaxy group known as the NGC 4636 group. Other members of the group include NGC 4457, NGC 4586, NGC 4587, NGC 4600, NGC 4665, and NGC 4688. These galaxies, along with NGC 4753, Messier 61 and their groups form the southern boundary of the Virgo cluster. It can be difficult to determine which galaxies belong to which group especially around the southern edge of the Virgo cluster where there is a confusion of galaxies at different distances. NGC 4636 has also been listed as a member of the Virgo Cluster.

Its primary role is the development of players in preparation for the senior England women's national football team. It was reinstated as an age group in 2018. Under the new system the team will help develop players after each U-20 World Cup. They will take part in the Nordic Cup previously contested by the now defunct U23s, and in non-World Cup years (bi-annually) will provide a World Cup-type programme to keep the flow and consistency of preparation for England seniors. History =Beginnings= In February 1987 the Women's Football Association (WFA) appointed Liz Deighan to run a women's national under-21 team. Deighan had been a star midfielder in the England team which reached the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football. Four years later Deighan was not re- appointed and John Bilton took over. The team folded shortly afterwards because the WFA had run out of money. Eight of England's squad at the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup had come through Deighan's U-21 team, including Pauline Cope, Karen Burke and Louise Waller. =FA sanctioned team= In summer 2004, The Football Association (FA) decided to reconstitute the U-21 team in order to give women a higher level of play to better prepare them for the full national team. Senior team manager Hope Powell held a four-day camp in Shropshire and announced: \\"This is a major step forward for our international teams and will bridge the gap between Under-19 and Senior levels. We have been observing players in this age bracket for the last six months and with the clubs' assistance I believe we can make this a real success.\\" Powell installed her full-time assistant with the senior team, Brent Hills, as coach of the team, which remained an U-21 selection from 2004 through 2008. =Competing as an U-23 team= 2008 saw the change of England's youth national women's team moved to the U-23 level. The move was made by the FA in response to age-level changes FIFA had made to its oldest women's youth competition, now named FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. The age limit was raised from being a U-19 tournament to a U-20 tournament. This adjustment, coupled with a newly introduced U-23 age limit to the Nordic Cup, prompted the FA to rethink and eventually change the youth development team. = Return of U-21 team = Following a review in September 2018, the FA announced the amalgamation of the U23s and U20s squads to reform an Under-21s age group, which would become the top tier of the nation's new professional development phase. The move would align England's structure to that used in other European countries to allow for more age- appropriate games and better manage individual player development post-U20 World Cup for those who have genuine senior team potential. The FA's head of women's development Kay Cossington and senior team manager Phil Neville stressed the move as an important part of the wider, long-term plan prior to the following summer's World Cup. The then U20s manager Mo Marley was announced as the team's first head coach.  Eligibility  Although most national football teams represent a sovereign state, as a member of the United Kingdom's Home Nations, England is permitted by FIFA statutes to maintain its own national side that competes in all major tournaments. Every player must meet FIFA eligibility rules. However, as long as they are eligible, players can play for England at any level, making it possible to play for the U21s, the senior side, and then again for the U21s provided they also meet the age restrictions. It is also possible to play for one country at youth level and another at senior level. Current players The following 19 players were named to the squad for a double-header of friendlies against in March 2020.

This virus belongs to the family Rudiviridae. Like other viruses in the family Rudiviridae, it is common in geothermal environments.  Biology and biochemistry  SIRV2 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome. The viral DNA is replicated by 4 host DNA polymerases: Dpo1 through Dpo4. The virus has a rod-shaped morphology with a width of 23 nanometers (nm) and a length of 900 nm. Three terminal fibers, 28 nm in length, have been observed on both ends of the virus. The terminal fibers mediate attachment of the virus to type 4 pili abundantly present on the host cell surface. SIRV2 is able to survive additions of 6 molar (M) urea, absolute ethanol, octanol-2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in neutral pH and 25 degrees Celsius. In vitro testing has shown that SIRV2 is still able to infect at 70-80 degrees Celsius and in a pH 3 solution. SIRV2gp19 was found to be a single-stranded DNA endonuclease in 2011. This was proven by inducing a mutation in the SIRVgp19 protein Motif II from the amino acid aspartate to alanine which resulted in a loss of nuclease activity. This protein is functional within pH 7-10. Magnesium chloride was found to be a cofactor to this protein in 1971. Sodium chloride concentrations above 100 mM inhibit SIRV2gp19.  Structure  A three-dimensional reconstruction of the SIRV2 virion at ~4 angstrom resolution has been obtained by cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy. The structure revealed a previously unknown form of virion organization, in which the alpha-helical major capsid protein of SIRV2 wraps around the DNA, making it inaccessible to solvent. The viral DNA was found to be entirely in the A-form, which suggested a common mechanism with bacterial spores for protecting DNA in the most adverse environments.

Through her father, she was descendant of Hugh Caulkins, who came with Richard Blinman, the first minister of the Plymouth colony. On her mother's side, her ancestry was noted in early English history, Sir Ranulphus de Manwaring being justice of Chester, in 1189‚Äì99; another, Sir William, was killed in the streets of Chester, defending Charles I on October 9, 1644. Her father died before she was born, and her uncle, Christopher Manwaring, was exceedingly fond of his talented niece, aiding her with his library, and for seven years, she dwelt with him. When she desired to teach, he set apart a room, still called her schoolroom. She was the first woman elected to be a member of the oldest historical society in the United States, the Massachusetts Historical Society, in 1849. Her histories of New London and Norwich aggregated the prominent features and details of the lives of the earliest inhabitants. Her private papers show that she was sometimes affected by depression, and especially felt that she had accomplished very little. Early years and education Frances Manwaring Caulkins was born in New London, Connecticut, on April 26, 1795. She was the daughter of Joshua and Fanny (Manwaring) Caulkins. Her ancestry, on the paternal side, can be traced to the early settlers of the vicinity of Plymouth. Richard Blinman, minister in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, England, having been silenced for non-conformity to the established church, migrated to the United States, and is supposed to have arrived at Plymouth in autumn 1640. He was accompanied in his voluntary exile by several members of his church, with their families, and all taken together were styled the \\"Welch party\\". Monmouthshire borders upon Wales, and probably most of them were of Welsh origin, but English appears to have been their native language. The exact time of their arrival is not known, but a part of them, including Rev. Blinman and Hugh Cauken, were propounded for freemanship at Plymouth on March 2, 1640, which was too early for any immigrant vessel to have arrived that year. In the first New England record, the family name is written as Cauken. It was stated by a writer in the Register that the original name was probably Colkin. William Colkin lived in King John's reign (1199‚Äì1216) and founded a hospital in Canterbury, which bore his name. The Caulkins and Gookings, with the different variations and changes in the spelling and pronunciation of the names, were all probably descended from a Colkin. Subsequently, there is great diversity, even among acknowledged relatives of the same stock, in spelling the name; some using u and s, and others rejecting one or both of these letters. Joshua Caulkins, the fifth child of Jonathan and Lydia, was born on January 19, 1772. He married Fanny Manwaring in 1792, by whom he had two children, and died of yellow fever at Port-au-Prince early in 1795, while on a trading voyage to the island of Saint-Domingue. Their second child, Frances Manwaring Caulkins, was born a few months later, on April 26, 1795. Their first child was Pamela (1793‚Äì1883). In 1807, Fanny Manwaring married Philemon Haven (d. 1819). There was at least one child from this union, Henry Philomen Haven, who was associated with the establishment of New London Public Library. During 1806, she became the pupil of Rev. Joshua Williams, who taught a select school for young ladies in Norwichtown. While attending this school, before she turned twelve years old, she patiently wrote out from memory a volume of educational lectures as they were delivered, from week to week. The elements of science which she acquired at this time were the foundation of all her future knowledge and attainments in literature; for, with occasional opportunities of instruction from the best teachers, she was yet in a great measure self-taught; and when once aided in the rudiments of a study or language would, herself, make all the progress she desired. She was an insatiable reader. While she enjoyed fiction and works of a lighter character, her taste for solid reading was early developed, and at eleven years of age, she was familiar with the English translation of the Iliad and Odyssey, and the thoughts of the standard English writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The beginnings of the strong affection for historical literature which characterized her later life was seen occasionally in her early years. In 1811 and 1812, Nancy Maria Hyde and Lydia Sigourney were teaching a young ladies' school in Norwich, and Caulkins entered their school in September 1811. Her first composition was on the subject \\"Antiquities\\". Even after she left the school, Caulkins and Sigourney remained warm friends and frequent correspondents. Caulkins evinced a remarkable aptitude for the acquisition of languages, and with some advantages enjoyed under different teachers, she added private study, and acquired a thorough knowledge of Latin, and was able to read and teach both that language and the French with facility and acceptance. A considerable portion of her time, from 1812 to 1819, while her mother resided in Norwich, was spent by her in the family of her uncle Christopher Manwaring at New London. He was a great admirer of Pope, Johnson and the old English authors. He had a good library and became very fond of the society of his niece, and proud of her talents. He was a great friend of Madison and an early admirer of Andrew Jackson. Caulkins had shown an unusual talent for versification as well as for prose writing, but she did not receive encouragement from the family to produce works for publication. Among her manuscripts are many fugitive pieces of poetry without date, but evidently written in early life. The first, in apparently the oldest book, is entitled the \\"Indian Harp\\", and would do credit to her later years. The fourth in order, in this book, is a long poem on \\"Thanksgiving\\" and the only one dated. This is stated to have been written in 1814. One earlier piece is on a loose sheet, dated October 26, 1813, and entitled \\"The Geranium's Complaint\\". The first of her writings, now known to have been printed, appeared in the Connecticut Gazette on April 17, 1816. Career After her step-father's death in 1819, having before this been occasionally employed in teaching small schools, Caulkins became determined to support herself and, if necessary, to aid her mother. On January 4, 1820, she opened a select school for young ladies in Norwichtown. As her talent for teaching was developed, her scholars increased, and the school acquired an excellent reputation and was well sustained for nine years. In 1829, she accepted an invitation from the trustees of the female academy at New-London, to take charge of that institution. She was invited back to Norwich in 1832, and was principal of the academy there, with a large number of pupils, until the close of the year 1834, when she relinquished finally the duties of a teacher. During those fifteen years, she had under her charge nearly 400 young ladies. Among her pupils were the wives of Senators Jabez W. Huntington and William Alfred Buckingham and three daughters of Charles Lathrop, afterwards missionaries to India. Very many of her pupils became themselves teachers. The year following the close of her school she spent visiting her friends and in recreation. She spent some time in the family of Rev. Levi Nelson, of Lisbon, Connecticut, in 1825, for the special purpose of advancing her knowledge of Latin, and took lessons in the French language, from M. Roux. While living in New York City, she pursued the study of German, and under the instructions of Maroncelli, gained such a knowledge of Italian, that she was able to read Dante and Tasso in the originals. In spring 1836, she went to New York and resided in the family of her cousin, D. H. Nevins, until May 1842, when she removed to New London, remaining there until she died. During her residence in New York, she was intimately acquainted with William Allen Hallock and Mr. Cook, secretaries of the American Tract Society. In 1835, that society published a premium tract entitled, Do your Children reverence the Sabbath? and the following year, The Pequot of a Hundred Years, both written by Caulkins, and of which they had issued 1,058,000 copies. She next prepared for them, in 1841, Children of the Bible, all in verse and original, and, in 1846, Child's Hymn-Book, partly a compilation. In 1847, she furnished the Tract Primer, one of the most popular and useful books ever published by that society. They printed 950,000 copies of it in English, and tens of thousands were published in Armenian, and other foreign languages. The society, at a meeting of its publishing committee on April 23, 1849, by vote, invited her to prepare a suitable series of books for children and youth, to follow the Primer. In compliance with this request, she furnished six volumes of Bible-Studies, forming an illustrative commentary on the whole Scriptures, and showing accurate scholarship and biblical research, interesting to the young, but full of valuable information for all who love the word of God. She was five years (from 1854 to 1859) in preparing this series, and contributed to the society, in 1861, one more work, entitled Eve and her Daughters, being sketches of the distinguished women of the Bible in verse. She was also, up to her death a frequent contributor to their American Messenger, furnishing them, but one week before her death, \\"The Aged Emigrant\\" ‚Äî a few verses of poetry ‚Äî the last line being \\"A Steppingstone to Heaven\\". A deep sense of her religious obligation pervaded her life, and was a part of her literary work. She loved to linger among the graves and written records of people's lives and deeds. She recovered many an almost obliterated tomb-stone, and preserved its story from oblivion. Nearly every burial place in the county was personally examined and any stone of great age or special interest was faithfully transcribed. Her contributions to the local papers of New London were numerous, and with any striking event in the history of the place, or with the decease of any aged or distinguished person, an interesting article was written, in which passing events were interwoven with previous history. Something from the mass of historical and genealogical information which she had accumulated, was first given to the public in the form of a history of the town of Norwich, in 1845. It was a book of 360 pages, with some local illustrations, and was well received and appreciated by the public. In 1852, she published a larger work, The History of New-London, of 672 pages. This was very carefully and thoroughly prepared, and won many commendations from distinguished scholars and antiquaries. In 1860, some of the volumes of this history being still in sheets, twenty pages were added and bound up with the original book, thus giving eight years additional records. Her materials having greatly increased since the issue of the first history of Norwich, and the edition being out of print, she re-wrote the entire work, and a new volume of 700 pages was given to tho public in 1866. Massachusetts Historical Society Caulkins had now become widely known to many of the leading writers, particularly of antiquarians, in different parts of the country. Edward Everett, Robert C. Winthrop, George Bancroft and others frequently corresponded with her, and acknowledged her ability and accuracy. Sylvester Judd, of Northampton, and the Hon. James Savage, of Boston, fully appreciated her historical knowledge, and frequently availed themselves of her stores of information respecting the early colonists of New England. Roger S. Baldwin and Henry White of New-Haven were among those who highly esteemed her works. She was elected to honorary and corresponding membership by several historical societies, which appreciated her historical researches and her accumulated antiquarian lore. At the time of her death, she was the only woman upon whom the Massachusetts Historical Society conferred the honor of membership. Never possessing a strong physical frame, she suffered from a long and slow fever in summer 1866. At this same time, the second edition of her history of Norwich had just gone to the printer, and the last proofs had been corrected. For a time, she slowly regained a comfortable measure of health and strength, and was able to resume her literary labors, which were continued until the last week of her life. She died in New London, Connecticut, on February 3, 1869, and was buried at Cedar Grove Cemetery, New London. Religion It is very evident from her early writings that she fully accepted and believed the main doctrines of the Scriptures as they were received and held by her Puritan ancestors. She was profoundly impressed with a sense of her accountability to God, and the responsibility which ever rested upon her to use the talents which He had given her. Within her highest aspirations, she retained a prevailing sense of subjection to the Divine Will. The great doctrines of religion were especially the subject of anxious thought and solemn reflection, from 1826 to 1831. During the latter year, she developed a deep yearning for a knowledge of God. First Church, New London Under the preaching of Rev. Dr. McEwen, pastor of the First Church in New London, she felt a sense of personal sinfulness and need of a divine saviour; and she publicly acknowledged her deliverance from doubts and fears, and her confidence in Jesus as her Redeemer by a public profession of her faith and union with the First Church on July 5, 1831. She immediately engaged in Sunday school work, and gave some time each week to regular Biblical study with her own school. In removing to Norwich, she became connected with the Second Congregational Church there, and, while in New York, united with the Mercer Street Presbyterian Church. After taking up permanent residence at New London, she transferred her connection to the Second Congregational Church in that city in February 1843. She served as secretary of the Ladies' Seamen's Friend Society for more than twenty years. Legacy A large mass of historical information and genealogical notes, and hundreds of pages of moral and religious prose, remain among her manuscripts. Many of her poetical effusions relating to the private affairs of family and life are part of her collection. The most precious papers are a number of pieces written within a few months before her death, the themes being of the coming life. A large collection of autographs ‚Äîmany of them not names alone, but letters of distinguished men and women- attest her interest in that department of antiquarian research; and a valuable assortment of ancient and modern coins had been assiduously gathered during her last fifty years. Specimens of continental currency, with many curious and rare pamphlets and sermons of ancient date, were treasured up, and the peculiar issues of corporate, state and governmental paper, representing fractional parts of a dollar, which were so general in the early years of the American Civil War, were to a good extent preserved in a specimen book. A mass of genealogical and antiquarian lore remained in manuscript in the possession of her relatives.

It was signed by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron in the coronation hall of the Aachen City Hall on 22 January 2019. History The proposal for a renewal of the √âlys√©e Treaty was first made by Emmanuel Macron on 26 September 2017 in his . At the 55th anniversary of the √âlys√©e Treaty, both Macron and Angela Merkel again spoke out in favour of deepening the cooperation in business, society, politics and technology. The coronation hall of the historic Aachen City Hall was chosen for the signing of the new treaty by President Macron and Chancellor Merkel on the (22 January 2019), the 56th anniversary of the √âlys√©e Treaty, because Aachen, as the main residence of Charlemagne (Charles the Great), represents a common history. Besides Macron and Merkel the ceremony was also attended by other high-ranking politicians, f.e. Klaus Johannis (President of Romania, chairing the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2019), Jean-Claude Juncker (European Commission President), Donald Tusk (President of the European Council) and Armin Laschet (Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia). Contents The Aachen Treaty consists of a total of 28 articles. The six main chapters of the treaty are labeled: # European affairs # Peace, security and development # Culture, education, research and mobility # Regional and transnational cooperation # Sustainable development, climate, environment and economic affairs # Organization Among other topics the aim of the contract is to strengthen the cultural diversity (¬ß9) as well as to align security interests of both countries. The Goethe-Institut and the Institut Fran√ßais plan to jointly open cultural institutions in Erbil, Bishkek, Rio de Janeiro and Palermo on the basis of the Aachen Treaty. In addition, the contract aims to intensify the cooperation of the defense politics of both countries, including the mutual assistance in potential crisis situations. The treaty was a factor in the formation of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly.

Her artwork examines the integration of thought and matter as a methodology to obtain a social consciousness. Orensanz's experience of Argentina's \\"Dirty War\\" has influenced her artwork and translated itself into the work Pensar es un Hecho Revolucionario (Thinking is a Revolutionary Act). Located in the Parque de la Memoria in Bueno Aires, it is attributed as a monument for the victims of state terrorism. Orensanz has been credited as a pioneer of conceptual art in Argentina and her experimentation with geometry, mathematics and philosophy later developed into her use of different materials. She is recognized for her use of the Carrara marble, ultimately displacing the canvas. The Carrara marble encapsulates the development of her manifesto \\"Fragmentism\\", which accounts for the singular embrace of the incomplete. Orensanz has showcased her collections in museums around the world, including the Centre Pompidou in Paris and Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires.  Early life  Initially, Marie had the intention of studying law, but later abandoned the idea when she took a nine month trip to Europe with her family. It was this experience that marked a keen interest in the world of art as she was able to find a new mode of communication through it. She began her art education training with contemporary artists in Argentina, Emilio Pettoruti and Antonio Segui, where she learned about analytic abstraction and figurative expressionism respectively. Her experience working with them was foundational in the way that she constructs space in creating her works. In 1972, Orensanz moves to Milan for a period of time, where she finds a new material that becomes the highlight of her artistic trajectory, the Carrara marble. Eventually, she becomes a naturalized French citizen and currently alternates her stay between Mountrouge, France and Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Argentina's \\"Dirty War\\"  alt= Orensanz defines herself as a nomadic artist as she travels back and forth from her birth country of Argentina and Europe, which served as a refuge during Argentina's last military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983. Orensanz's work Pensar es un hecho revolucionario was selected among 633 projects to commemorate the disappeared individuals of Argentina. This piece is formed from two equal iron parts that are separated from one another by a small distance. According to Orensanz, this intentional separation forces the spectator to reflect in order to appropriately read the perforated phrase that is the title. In a catalogue, she expresses that now of the motives for her dedication is the fight against injustice translated through artistic expression. Orensanz discovered the political potential in her work through her installation El pueblo de la Gallareta. She had created the installation in response to a workers' rally that took place and included their pamphlet on the gallery walls. Only a day after the opening of her exhibition the show was cancelled as the government noticed the message depicted through her work.  Conceptual art  The emergence of \\"conceptual art\\" sought for an idea or concept to take precedence over the traditional formal and material qualities of art. Artists during this time period sought to incorporate text as artwork as a means to incorporate a double meaning. In doing so, Orensanz explores the relationship of text with the chosen object. Her abstract forms are iconic in her conceptualism, which surpasses minimalism where only the idea is represented. Orensanz is able to most effectively express her ideas through the use of symbols. Dots, arrows, broken cars and fallen trees are each given a precise meaning. For example, a dotted line may be indicative of time and a broken car may represent the chaos of the city. In 2002, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires houses her installation,¬øPara qui√©n suenan las campanas? (2002), which consists of a series of seventeen white bells that propel from the ceiling. Each bell consists of phrase that serves as an answer to the question posed by the title of installation, such as \\"for those who doubt\\" or \\"for those who judge\\". It is in this way that Oresanz is able to create a dialogue concerning the injustices present in society. In particular, she finds interest in the way in which people move about in the exhibition, experiencing its spatial element. Some of the works Orensanz is most recognized for are the following: * Invisible (2018), a 3-meter-high key hole constructed out of rusted steel with the word, \\"invisible\\", carved out from the arch of the key hole and only visible to those directly underneath it. * El ambiente condiciona a la gente (2018), a set of three aluminum frames that outline parts of the title. One frame reads \\"El ambiente\\", another reads \\"Condiciona\\" and the last reads \\" A la gente\\". * Las ra√≠ces son femeninas (2009), located where she was born, Mar de Plata, is a steel monument three meters high that outlines the title of the work. It pays homage to Azucena Villaflor, an Argentine social activist and founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. * Igualdad (2013), an installation five meters high made out of rusted steel and located at the University de San Martin in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The installation is an enlarged pencil compass that outlines the title of the work at the apex.  Thought and matter  According to Christine Fr√®rot, Marie Orensanz explores different ways to integrate thought and matter, questioning both the world and society simultaneously. She has been driven by key experiences in her life that conduce her to create a social consciousness in her work. Early in her artistic career, she added an 'e' to her name after an incident where a gallery owner has mistaken her for a man. The man admired her work, but remarked that there was a major defect in her work, she was a woman and that her career as an artist would be limited by it. This experience marked her awareness of gender discrimination.  Fragmentism  Fr√®rot has stated that the concept of fragmentism is practiced by Orensanz through her selection of the Carrara marble. She questions the traditional notions of sculpture as she purposely leaves the marble in its natural state of environment as she views it as part of a larger whole and finds beauty in its broken condition. She uses the color white to convey neutrality and contrasts it with the color black to characterize a dynamic quality. Additionally, according to Orensanz, thoughts can also be fragmented and relies heavily on the \\"intersection of the fragments with the viewer's own thoughts and experiences.\\" Later on she developed a theory called Fragmentism and writes a manifesto in Spanish, English and Italian. It reads, \\"Fragmentism searches for integration of a part with a totality; transforms by multiple readings in an object non-terminate and unlimited, traversing time and space.\\"  Selected solo exhibitions  * Mari Orensanz: Pinturas, Art Gallery International, Buenos Aires (1971) * Marie Orensanz: \\"Fragmentismo\\"; Marbres, dessins, peintures, Galeries des Femmes, Paris (1982) * Camino de artista, Museo de Arte Moderno de Buenos Aires (1999) * Marie Orensanz: Variaciones sobre un mismo tema, Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes Juan B.

As chair of Floridians for a Fair Democracy, Meade led the successful effort to pass Florida Amendment 4, a 2018 state initiative that restored voting rights to over 1.4 million Floridians with previous felony convictions. In April 2019, Time magazine named Meade as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In June 2020, Meade was featured in a RepresentUs video focused on highlighting problems with America's criminal justice system. Biography According to The New York Times, Meade \\"was born in St. Croix and moved to Miami with his parents when he was 5. His mother worked as a waitress, and his father was a mechanic.\\" He graduated from high school in 1985, then joined the Army as a helicopter mechanic. While in the Army, he began using cocaine, a habit that escalated into years of drug use, other crimes, and imprisonment. In 2005, after being released from prison, he checked himself into a drug treatment program and began to rebuild his life. Meade graduated from Miami- Dade College in 2010 and finished law school at Florida International University in 2013. Florida law, however, prevented him (or anyone with a past felony conviction) from voting or being admitted to the Florida Bar. Felon disenfranchisement in Florida Florida as of 2018 was one of only three US states to deny voting rights to anyone with a felony record. Because felon disenfranchisement is part of Florida's Constitution, which requires a 60% vote to modify, many efforts to restore voting rights to former convicts had been unsuccessful, but Florida Amendment 4 passed with 64.55% of the vote. On January 8, 2019, an estimated 1.4 million ex-felons became eligible to vote.

Progeny of a mid-17th century English immigrant to South Kingstown, Rhode Island, the Perry family patriarch, Captain Christopher Raymond Perry, and his two sons Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and Commodore Matthew C. Perry, were seminal figures in the legitimization of the United States Navy and establishment of the United States Naval Academy. History =The Rhode Island Perrys and Their Origin= Christopher Raymond Perry was born on December 4, 1761, in Newport, Rhode Island, the son of the Hon. Judge (James) Freeman Perry (1732‚Äì1813) and his wife, Mercy Hazard (1739‚Äì1810). William Brewster (pictured) as well as Plymouth colonists Thomas Prence and George Soule Judge Freeman Perry was a physician and surgeon in the Revolutionary War, as well as a local magistrate who served as Judge of the Court of Washington County and President of the Town Council of South Kingstown. Christopher Raymond Perry's paternal great-grandfather, Edward Perry, came from Devon, England, and settled in Sandwich, Massachusetts, around 1650 with his wife, Mary Freeman. Mercy Hazard was a seventh-generation descendant of Captain Richard Raymond (1602‚Äì1692), and his wife, Julia,She may also have been named Judith who was likely born in Essex County, England, in 1602 and arrived in Salem, Massachusetts, about 1629, possibly with a contingent led by the Rev. Francis Higginson.The first actual date given for Richard is on August 6, 1629 when he is on the list of the 30 founding members of the First Church (Congregational) of Salem. He was about 27 years old and later was a founder of Norwich, Connecticut, and an \\"honored fore-father of Saybrook\\". Mercy Hazard was also a descendant of Governor Thomas Prence (1599‚Äì1673), a co-founder of Eastham, Massachusetts, who was a political leader in both the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies, and governor of Plymouth; and a descendant of Mayflower passengers, both of whom were signers of the Mayflower Compact, Elder William Brewster (c. 1567‚Äì1644), the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony, and George Soule (1593‚Äì1679), through his grandmother Susannah Barber Perry (1697‚Äì1755). American Revolution Christopher Perry enlisted, at the age of 14, in a local militia company named the Kingston Reds early in the American Revolution. He then served on a privateer commanded by a Captain Reed. After one cruise with Reed, Perry signed on to the privateer Mifflin commanded by George Wait Babcock. The Mifflin was captured by the British and Perry was confined to the infamous prison ship Jersey in New York harbor for three months before he managed to escape.The Life of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Alexander Slidell Mackenzie. Harper and Brothers. New York. 1840. pp. 17‚Äì18. In 1779, Perry joined the Continental Navy as a seaman aboard the frigate USS Trumbull commanded by Captain James Nicholson. On June 1, 1780, the Trumbull engaged the British letter of marque Watt in a hard-fought, but indecisive, action in which the Trumbull suffered 8 killed and 31 wounded compared to the Watts 13 killed and 79 wounded.The Life of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Alexander Slidell Mackenzie. Harper and Brothers. New York. 1840. pp. 18‚Äì19. Perry then enlisted on another privateer which was captured off the coast of Great Britain. He then was taken as a prisoner to Newry Barracks in Ireland where he met his future wife, Sarah Wallace Alexander (1768‚Äì1830). Perry managed another escape by masquerading as a British seaman and taking passage to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. From St. Thomas he took passage to Charleston, South Carolina shortly before the war's conclusion in 1783.The Life of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Alexander Slidell Mackenzie. Harper and Brothers. New York. 1840. pp. 19‚Äì20. =Post war= Sarah Alexander was descended from an uncle of Scottish Knight William Wallace After the war, Perry served as a mate on a merchantman which sailed to Ireland where Perry was able to bring his beloved Sarah to the United States. They were married in Philadelphia on August 2, 1784. The young couple then moved to South Kingstown, Rhode Island where they lived with Perry's parents on their 200-acre estate. Their first child, Oliver Hazard Perry, was born in August 1785.The Life of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. Alexander Slidell Mackenzie. Harper and Brothers. New York. 1840. p.p. 19-21. Sarah Wallace (n√©e Alexander) (1768‚Äì1830) was born in County Down, Ireland and was a descendant of an uncle of William Wallace, the Scottish knight and landowner who is known for leading a resistance during the Wars of Scottish Independence and is today remembered as a patriot and national hero.Skaggs, David Curtis. \\"Oliver Hazard Perry: Honor, Courage, and Patriotism in the Early U.S. Navy\\". US Naval Institute Press, 2006. P. 4 =The Two Brothers= Oliver Hazard Perry (August 23, 1785 ‚Äì August 23, 1819) was an American naval commander, born in South Kingstown, Rhode Island. As the most well-known and prominent member of naval dynasty, he was the son of Sarah Wallace Alexander and United States Navy Captain Christopher Raymond Perry, and older brother of Commodore Matthew C. Perry. Perry served in the West Indies during the Quasi War of 1798‚Äì1800 against France, in the Mediterranean during the Barbary Wars of 1801‚Äì1815, and in the Caribbean fighting piracy and the slave trade, but is most noted for his heroic role in the War of 1812 during the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie.Skaggs, 2006, p. xi During the war against Britain, Perry supervised the building of a fleet at Erie, Pennsylvania. He earned the title \\"Hero of Lake Erie\\" for leading American forces in a decisive naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie, receiving a Congressional Gold Medal and the Thanks of Congress.White, 1895, p. 288Bloom, Page essay His leadership materially aided the successful outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories, and the victory was a turning point in the battle for the west in the war. He is remembered for the words on his battle flag, \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\", which was a tribute to the dying command of his colleague Captain James Lawrence of USS Chesapeake. He is also known for his message to General William Henry Harrison which reads in part, \\"We have met the enemy and they are ours; ...\\" Perry became embroiled in a long-standing and bitter controversy with the commander of , Captain Jesse Elliott, over their conduct in the Battle of Lake Erie, and both were the subject of official charges. In 1815, he successfully commanded in the Mediterranean during the Second Barbary War. So seminal was his career that he was lionized in the press (being the subject of scores of books and articles).Paullin, 1918, See Bibliography He has been frequently memorialized, and many places, ships and persons have been named in his honor. Matthew Calbraith Perry (April 10, 1794 ‚Äì March 4, 1858) was a Commodore of the United States Navy who commanded ships in several wars, including the War of 1812 and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848). He played a leading role in the opening of Japan to the West with the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. Perry was interested in the education of naval officers, and assisted in the development of an apprentice system that helped establish the curriculum at the United States Naval Academy. With the advent of the steam engine, he became a leading advocate of modernizing the U.S. Navy and came to be considered \\"The Father of the Steam Navy\\" in the United States.

He spent the four years from 1894 to 1898 as Naval Attache in France and Russia. Throughout the war with Spain he was Executive Officer of the battleship Iowa, and for most of the war was stationed off Santiago de Cuba. He was advanced five numbers for eminent and conspicuous conduct in the battle which destroyed Cerver's squadson. While in command of the Nashville from 1899 t0 1901, Admiral Rodgers, then ranking as a Commander, served in the West Indies and the Philippines, and in China during the Boxer troubles.

Aviation Pioneers Commander John Rodgers, USN John Rodgers (January 15, 1881 ‚Äì August 27, 1926) was an officer in the United States Navy and a pioneering aviator who led the first attempt at a non-stop flight from California to Hawaii. Given the technology of the time, this tested the limits of both aircraft range and the accuracy of aerial navigation. The expedition was to include three planes. Rodgers commanded the flying boat PN-9 No. 1. The PN-9 No. 3 was commanded by Lt. Allen P. Snody. The third plane was to have been a new design, which was not completed in time to join the expedition. Due to the risks, the Navy positioned 10 guard ships spaced 200 miles apart between California and Hawaii to refuel or recover the aircraft if necessary. The two PN-9s departed San Pablo Bay, California (near San Francisco) on August 31. Lt. Snody's plane had an engine failure about five hours into its flight, was forced to land in the ocean, and was safely recovered. Calbraith \\"Cal\\" Rodgers in Pasadena, California Calbraith Perry Rodgers (January 12, 1879 ‚Äì April 3, 1912) was an American aviation pioneer, the cousin of the aforementioned, who made the first transcontinental airplane flight across the U.S. from September 17, 1911, to November 5, 1911, with dozens of stops, both intentional and accidental. On October 10, 1910, publisher William Randolph Hearst offered the Hearst prize, US$50,000 to the first aviator to fly coast to coast, in either direction, in less than 30 days from start to finish. Rodgers persuaded J. Ogden Armour, of Armour and Company, to sponsor the flight, and in return he named the plane, a Wright Model EX, after Armour's grape soft drink Vin Fiz. A special train of three cars, including sleeper, diner, and shop-on-wheels full of spare parts, was assembled to follow Rodgers, who planned to fly above the railroad tracks.Charlie Wentz.

The mound is a three-tiered structure, and found to contain three separate burial chambers, one with a stone sarcophagus in the north, one with a clay sarcophagus in the south and one with a wooden coffin in the west. The bottom tier of the structure and its surrounding moat is now underground due to generations of agricultural activity in the area. The site is also being encroached upon by residential housing developments. The kofun was first excavated in 1980 by Nagoya University. The stone sarcophagus had been looted in the Meiji period, and the clay sarcophagus was not excavated. The wooden coffin was found to contain iron and steel swords and tools made from iron, along with jade balls, glass ornaments and pottery fragments on the outside. The inside of the coffin was not excavated. Haniwa recovered from the site was in various forms, including cylindrical-shaped haniwa, and haniwa in the shape of houses, human figures and in the form of tools and shields.

Early life In 1968, Yolanda and her family moved to Mexico City were she currently resides. Yolanda Andrade attended the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York from 1976-1977. She began working as a photographer since 1977. During these years she worked as a photography professor at the Centro de la Imagen, Tecnologico de Monterrey, and the Escuela de Fotografia Nacho Lopez. While living in Rochester, she received the Guggenheim fellowship to create a photographic project about Mexico City, which would later be known as the Mexican Passion. This same year she began working as a still photographer for a Mexican film production company. Later on, she worked as an independent photographer for different types of magazines. Since she started working freelance, there was a moment were she began teaching the art of still photography at different schools to help her financial with the various projects she was looking into. The first couple of years as an independent photographer she spent her time specializing in black and white still photography. Then in 2003 she began exploring digital and color photography. The main focus of her work was to capture the relationship between the people and the city. Along with other grants that she earned, it helped her fund her collections among many different countries such as Mexico, United States, and Europe. With a shift in photography came a shift in the themes that she was capturing. Her black and white photos targeted more people while color photographs displayed more symbolic objects. Work Andrade is most known for capturing what she describes as the \\"Mexican Passion\\", images that show the everyday life and culture of the people from Mexico: people mixing in celebration, tradition, and protest. For the majority of her time as a photographer, Andrade captured the \\"carnivalesque\\" world of Mexico City. She highlighted the cross between modernization, history, faith, and tradition which was the start of Mexico's culture. In her book titled Mexican Passion, some of the photographs being taken were of the hipster scene of the youth. She showcased the various protests that took place such as the LGBTQ parade in Mexico City to illustrate the modernization of the city that is moving towards a progressive era. The pictures taken do not show resistance but rather pride and joy in each of the individual's faces. Along with being a photographer, Yolanda is also an author of visual books showcasing her collection. She participates in various discussions and conferences about Latin American photography. She member of an art association called the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte del FONCA (National System of Art Creators) who their main focus was to showcase are as having an important part in expressing national identity and appreciation of Mexico. This is part of her activism work where she uses the photographs taken as a form of calling out the oppression done towards a group of people. Through her work, highlights how different groups of people come together as a united front but captured in a sense of celebration of identity. =Photography= Andrade began taking pictures in 1976 in the streets of Mexico. These photographs taken were primarily in black and white. Her photographs were mainly centered around the Mexican culture and street life. Her work could be described as poetically documentary at this point. During this time she tried integrating popular arts and urban culture, something that was emerging in Mexican media. A few of the photographs that she has taken can be found in the website \\"Ciudad de Mexico\\" . These images are photographs taken in black and white where they make a stand in what is being experienced in the streets of Mexico. Since these images were taken in the streets of Mexico, people were her main art subjects. In 2003, Andrade made the switch from black and white to color. She moved from using film to digital camera which she incorporated color to the photos she took. The change also came with a change in scenery. People were no longer her main focus of her photographs. Her work became more centered through composition and symbolism. Instead of only capturing photographs in Mexico City, she visited other countries as well. Some of these countries included Europe and India.This helped her obtain a new way of capturing the \\"youthful perspective\\", that is targeting a different audience in her works. In her photographs, she touches on the themes of cities, streets, pop culture, travel, and memory. She makes sure that her work targets representation and the real world and showing how everything around us can create a different way of experiencing our everyday interactions with the world. Her work is mainly targeting pop culture in the modern society of the city. =Exhibitions= The majority of Andrade's work is exhibited in Mexico, the United States, and Europe. She has more than twenty five solo shows that display her photographs. Her work is exhibited in various locations. The locations are listed below.

In this book, Andrade tried to capture the history taken of the streets of Mexico. These black and white photographs call on the culture that is found when roaming through the streets of Mexico City. The title means \\"transparent veils/ veiled transparencies\\" where some of the images captured are of religious statues that are covered up.

She was primarily known for writing comedies.  Biography  = Theatrical beginnings = Kavanaugh was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1874, and she attended school at Mount de Sales and Notre Dame. Both of her parents died when she was young. She took an early interest in storytelling; as she'd later recall, she'd often get in trouble as a young girl for working up plays in the schoolyard. Still, she never thought she'd make a career for herself in the theater. She began acting with the Albaugh Stock Company around 1900, and Valerie Bergere eventually brought her on the road for her touring act. Soon she was a star of the local Baltimore theater scene, frequently writing and acting in her own plays and collaborating with the Ziegfeld players. Her 1903 play Peggy attracted special notice among critics. By 1936, she estimated that she'd written 70 three-act plays, along with 30 one-act plays and vaudeville sketches. = Hollywood career = In 1917, Kavanaugh was hired to the reading and writing staff at the New York‚Äìbased Metro film studio. She later recounted her delight at getting a response from Metro and having her first story, The Wheel of the Law, hit the big screen. In 1918, Kavanaugh won second place in Photoplay's scenario-writing contest for ', which would eventually be produced. She was brought on under contract to supervise continuity before becoming the head of Metro's story department. She collaborated with June Mathis a lot in those early years.. Eventually she became homesick for the stage, and she took a sabbatical to return to Baltimore, where she opened the Katharine Kavanaugh School, which taught acting and screenwriting. She also aimed to write, direct, and produce her own motion pictures. This was not to come to fruition, however, and she ultimately returned to working with Mathis, who brought her on at First National, where the two worked together for several more years. One of her biggest claims to fame was helping to create the Jones Family characters, who would appear in 17 low-budget films between 1936 and 1940. The first film in the series, Every Saturday Night, was released in 1936, and Kavanaugh would also co-write Educating Father, released later that same year. While her screenwriting career cooled in the late 1930s, she continued writing plays that were produced in the Los Angeles area until her death in 1942. She and her husband, Oliver Ziegfeld (her manager in her early days), were the founders of the Studio Village Theatre Guild. = Personal life = Kavanaugh married fellow actor Oliver C. Ziegfeld (a cousin of Broadway impresario of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.) in Baltimore 1910, but she continued writing under her maiden name. The pair had no children.

Fences were part of the extensive network of accomplices in the criminal underground of Ming and Qing China. Their occupation entailed criminal activity, but as fences often acted as liaisons between the more respectable community to the underground criminals, they were seen as living a ‚Äúprecarious existence on the fringes of respectable society‚Äù. A fence worked alongside bandits, but in a different line of work. The network of criminal accomplices that was often acquired was essential to ensuring both the safety and the success of fences. Fencing as an Occupation =Entering the Occupation= The path into the occupation of a fence stemmed, in a large degree, from necessity. As most fences came from the ranks of poorer people, they often took whatever work they could - both legal and illegal. Like most bandits operated within their own community, fences also worked within their own town or village. For example, in some satellite areas of the capital, military troops lived within or close to the commoner population and they had the opportunity to hold illegal trades with commoners. In areas like Baoding and Hejian, local peasants and community members not only purchased military livestock such as horses and cattle, but also helped to hide the ‚Äústolen livestock from military allured by the profits‚Äù. Local peasants and community members became fences and they hid criminal activities from officials in exchange of products or money from these soldiers. =Fencing as a ‚Äúside business‚Äù= Most fences were not individuals who only bought and sold stolen goods to make a living. The majority of fences had other occupations within the \\"polite\\" society and held a variety of official occupations. These occupations included laborers, coolies, and peddlers. Such individuals often encountered criminals in markets in their line of work, and, recognizing a potential avenue for an extra source of income, formed acquaintances and temporary associations for mutual aid and protection with criminals. In one example, an owner of a teahouse overheard the conversation between Deng Yawen, a criminal, and others planning a robbery and he offered to help to sell the loot for an exchange of spoils. At times, the robbers themselves filled the role of fences, selling to people they met on the road. This may actually have been preferable for robbers, in certain circumstances, because they would not have to pay the fence a portion of the spoils. Butchers were also prime receivers for stolen animals because of the simple fact that owners could no longer recognize their livestock once butchers slaughtered them. Animals were very valuable commodities within Ming China, and a robber could potentially sustain a living from stealing livestock and selling them to butcher-fences. Types of Stolen Goods =Information as a Good= Although the vast majority of the time, fences worked with physical stolen property, fences who also worked as itinerant barbers also sold information as a good. Itinerant barbers often amassed important sources of information and news as they traveled, and sold significant pieces of information, often to criminals in search of places to hide or individuals to rob. In this way, itinerant barbers also served the role as a keeper of information that could be sold to both members of the criminal underground, as well as powerful clients in performing the function of a spy. =Human Trafficking= He or she not only sold items such as jewelry and clothing but was also involved in human trafficking hostages that banditires kidnapped. Women and children were the easiest and among the most common ‚Äúobjects‚Äù the fences sold. Most of the female hostages were sold to fences and then sold as prostitutes, wives, or concubiences. One example of human trafficking can be seen from Chen Akuei‚Äôs gang who abducted a servant girl and sold her to Lin Baimao, who in turn sold her to a thirty parts of silver as wives. In contrast to women, who required beauty to sell for a high price, children were sold regardless of their physical appearance or family background. Children were often sold as servants or entertainers, while young girls were often sold as prostitutes.  Network of Connections  Similarly to merchants of honest trade, one of the most significant tools of a fence was their network of connections. As they were the middlemen between robbers and clients, fences needed to form and maintain connections in both the ‚Äúpolite‚Äù society, as well as among criminals. However, there were a few exceptions in which members of the so called ‚Äúwell-respected‚Äù society become receivers and harbourers. They not only help bandits to sell the stolen goods but also acted as agents of bandits to collect protection money from local merchants and residents. These \\"part-time\\" fences with high social status used their connection with bandits to help themselves gain social capital as well as wealth. = Relationships with Clients = It was extremely important to their occupation that fences maintained a positive relationship with their customers, especially their richer gentry clients. When some members of the local elites joined the ranks of fences, they not only protect bandits to protect their business interests, they actively took down any potential threats to their illegal profiting, even government officials. In the Zhejiang Province, the local elites not only got the provincial commissioner, Zhu Wan, dismissed from his office but also eventually ‚Äú[drove] him to suicide‚Äù. This was possible because fences often had legal means of making a living, as well as illegal activities and could threaten to turn in bandits into the authorities. = Relationship with Bandits = It was also essential for them to maintain a relationship with bandits. However, it was just as true that bandits needed fences to make a living. As a result, fences often held dominance in their relationship with bandits. Taking advantage of their dominance in their relationships with bandits, fences also cheated bandits by manipulating the prices they paid bandits for the stolen property. =Safehouses= Aside from simply buying and selling stolen goods, fences often played additional roles in the criminal underground of early China. Because of the high floating population in public places such as inns and teahouses, they often became ideal places for banditries and gangs to gather to exchange information and plan for their next crime. Harborers, people who provided safehouses for criminals, often played the role of receiving stolen goods from their harbored criminals to sell to other customers. Safehouses included inns, teahouses, brothels, opium dens, as well as gambling parlors, and employees or owners of such institutions often functioned as harborers, as well as fences. These safehouses locate in places where there are high floating population and people from all kinds of social backgrounds.  Brothels  Brothels themselves helped these bandits to hide and sell stolen goods because of the special Ming Law that exempted brothels from being held responsible ‚Äúfor the criminal actions of their clients.‚Äù Even though government requires owners of these places to report any suspicious activities, lack of enforcement from government itself and some of the owners being fences for the bandits make an ideal safehouse for bandits and gangs.  Pawnshops  Pawnshops were also often affiliated with fencing stolen goods. The owners or employees of such shops often paid cash for stolen goods at a price a great deal below market value to bandits, that were often desperate for money, and resold the goods to earn a profit. Punishment of Fences Two different Ming Laws, the Da Ming L√º Â§ßÊòéÂæã and the Da Gao Â§ßËØ∞, drafted by the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, sentenced fences with different penalties based on the categories and prices of the products that were stolen. =Foreign Trade= In coastal regions, illegal trading with foreigners, as well as smuggling became a huge concern for the government during the mid to late Ming era. In order to prohibit this crime, the government passed a law in which illegal smugglers who traded with foreigners without the consent of the government would be punished with exile to the border for military service. =Military Property= In areas where military troops were stationed, stealing and selling military property would result in a more severe punishment. In the Jiaqing time, a case was recorded of stealing and selling military horses. The empire himself gave direction that the thieves who stole the horses and the people who helped to sell the horses would be put on cangue and sent to labor in a border military camp. =Salt= In the salt mines, the penalty for workers who stole salt and people who sold the stolen salt was the most severe. Consider salt is a very valuable property in Ming China, anyone who was arrested and found guilty of stealing and selling government salt was put to death.

Cecilia Fajardo-Hill and Andrea Guinta, Prestel, April 9 2017. Page 330.and later on she joined the faculty. In 2007 she also obtained her master's degree in aesthetics and art theory there. Marx was a student and assistant to Manuel Lopez Blanco, the head of the Department of Philosophy and Aesthetics at the University, where she was taught about the possibilities of consciousness through Hegelian theories, and phenomenological and semiotic thinking. Marx studied sculpture with Aurelio Macchi where she began to create sculptures out of scrap metal with rust.  Career  In 1968-1969 she had an exhibit at the Lirolay Gallery of Buenos Aires and was awarded the \\"Ver y Estimar\\" prize, where she was invited to join the Di Tella Institute but it was closed due to General Ongania's dictatorship. Marx was interested in collective art, and in the late 1960s Edgardo A. Vigo introduced her to \\"mail art\\" which was related to \\"new forms of concrete poetry: process poems, visual poetry, action poetry\\"Graciela G. Guti√©rrez Marx. ‚ÄúInvisible Artists, or the Net Without a Fisherman...(My Life in Mail Art)‚Äù. ARTMargins. Volume 1. Issue 2-3. June-October 2012. Page 149.. In the mid 1970s, Horacio Zavala, taught her all about Artecorreo by sending her an invite to an exhibition of rubber stamps where she became part of the mail exchange lists. In 1975, Marx participated in the first mail art exhibit in Argentina entitled ‚Äú√öltima exposici√≥n internacional de art correo‚Äù where she had ‚Äúwoodcut envelopes with her face printed on them and rubber-stamp artworks whose tone anticipated the disappearance of thousands of people during the dictatorship. When the dictatorship ended in 1984 and democracy was restored she changed her signature to ‚ÄúGGMarx‚Äù. She has been in multiple exhibits and in the 1980s she started participating in a collaborative project of collective poems (poemas colectivos). One of which was entitled ‚ÄúEl tendedero‚Äù (the clothesline) where she invited people to build a poem together where they would write a few words on notecard and pin it an article of clothing of a loved one and then sewed the clothing into a flag. During 1984 Marx helped form the Asociaci√≥n Latinoericana y del Caribe de Artistas-correo in the city of Rosario with Clemente Padin, Noni Arga√±araz, Jorge Orta, Susana Lombardo, and Mamablanca (Guti√©rrez Marx‚Äôs mother) after their exhibit entitled Primer encuentro de arte experimental y mail-art.

Dani was born in Jerusalem to Michael Zohary, a botany professor, and Leah. Inspired by travels with his father on botanical expeditions, Dani took an interest in the flora of the region and began to interact with other researchers like Tuviah Kushnir, Daniel Raz and Eviatar. Conscripted at 17, he joined the Palmach and joined the Hebrew University three years later. Study was interrupted by war in 1948 and he was posted into the field where he lost close friends including Tuviah Kushnir. In 1952 he moved to the University of California and worked on his PhD under G. Ledyard Stebbins on the cytogenetics of Dactylis glomerata. He received the John Belling prize in genetics. In 1954 he married Devora and in 1956, he returned to the Hebrew University where he helped found the department of genetics. He guided numerous students who became plant breeders and geneticists.

It is one of the few surviving provincial temples established by Emperor Sh≈çmu during the Nara period (710 - 794). Due to this connection, the foundation stones of the Nara period temple now located to the south of the present day complex were designated as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government in 1916. History The temple is located in western Gifu Prefecture, a short distance to the west of the present-day downtown of ≈ågaki. The location was near the ichinomiya of Mino Province, the Nang≈´ Taisha, the Hirui≈çzuka Kofun and the ruins of the Mino Provincial government complex. The exact date of the temple's foundation is unknown; however, since it follows the same standardized layout for provincial temples all over Japan, it is believed that work started around 741 AD and was completed by the 750s. Per historical records, it was repaired in 766 AD, received a donation of rice in 770, and suffered from extensive damage due to a storm in 775 AD. The original temple was destroyed by a fire in 887 AD, and although reconstructed, disappears from history by the end of the 12th century. The present temple was founded in 1615. The site of the original temple has been known since antiquity. The foundations of the Kond≈ç were discovered in 1916, and the site was extensively excavated from 1968-1979. As a result of these excavations, the area protected by the National Historic Site designation was expanded in 1971 and again in 1974. A museum was opened on the site by ≈ågaki city in 1982. The entire site was opened to the public as an archaeological park in 2007. The temple's honzon, a seated Yakushi Nyorai statue is 3.04 meters tall and was caved from a single block of keyaki wood. Temple legend states that this statue was carved by the famed priest Gy≈çki in the Nara period, but stylistically,this statue dates from the late 11th century and was extensively repaired in the Edo period. It is a national Important Cultural Property of Japan.

Description The Zambezi bream is a medium-sized species of haplochromine which has a large head with a rounded snout and an slightly, upward pointing mouth. It has a slender body with a relatively straight outline, a long dorsal fin and a truncated caudal fin. The dorsal fin contains 14-16 spines and 10-13 soft rays while the anal fin has 2 spines and 7-10 soft rays. The lateral line is in two sections and contains 36 scales. The body is brown in colour on the upperside which his marked by darker brown bars, with the colour becoming iridescent green towards the belly. The scales have red in their centres and there are red dots on the parts of the dorsal and anal fins supported by rays, while the tail has brown spots and there are orange egg imitating spots on the anal fin. They grow to a total length of . Distribution The Zambezi bream is found in the upper and middle catchments of the Zambezi River system in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Namibia, in the upper Save River and upper Runde River in Zimbabwe and in the Chobe River, Okavango River and Cunene River in Botswana, Namibia and Angola. A population in the Mwekera, a tributary of the Kafue River may represent a separate species. Although some sources state that it is absent in the Cunene. Habitat and biology The Zambezi bream is found in the margins of river channels and tributaries where there is a slower current as well as in lagoons and floodplains dominated by sawgrass, wherever there is an abundance of aquatic plants or tangles of tree roots. They are predators which feed on molluscs especially snails and freshwater mussels, as well as freshwater crustaceans and insect larvae and the eggs and fry of other fishes. It is preyed on by cormorants and African darters and also by subsistence fishermen. Spawning takes place in the summer and the female takes a brood of 800 eggs into her mouth after spawning, she also mouthbroods the fry. They have a lifespan of 3‚Äì4 years. This species is possibly an important intermediate host of the parasitic nematodes of the genus Contracaecum, the ultimate hosts being the piscivorous birds which frequently feed on Zambezi bream including white-breasted cormorant, long- tailed cormorant, African darter and grey heron.

The game tries to capture the subtle intrigue of classic spy films, while thrusting the player into a mysterious world of covert operations, counterintelligence, conspiracy and paranoia. Plot Set in 1983 Phantom Doctrine takes place in an alternative Cold War where brainwashing is a real danger and a global conspiracy controls the world. The player takes on the role of a former CIA, KGB or Mossad agent. While leading a secret organization known only as The Cabal, the player is drawn into a global conspiracy. By carrying out secret missions, investigating classified files, and interrogating enemy agents, a sinister plot is uncovered that will eventually lead into a counter-conspiracy to stop the group known as Beholder Initiative. Gameplay The game is divided between global strategy management elements utilizing the base and world map screens, intel investigation, and tactical missions. There is also Extended Playthrough mode (unlockable after beating the game) where the player will learn more about what happened behind the scenes. =Hideout= Here the player manages resources, can build new or upgrade existing facilities, hire new agents or assign hired agents to perform different tasks. Agents can craft various items, forge money, train new proficiencies, heal in the infirmary, or analyze obtained intel. Danger level is the indicator of how close the Beholder Initiative is to finding the location of the player's hideout, which will eventually end in an enemy raid unless the location is changed. Danger cannot be decreased, only controlled. Various activities can increase its level like abandoning agents in missions, allowing enemy agents to complete their activity, or recruiting double agents. MK Ultra is one of the most notable unlockable facilities. It provides players with direct control over captured enemy agents by granting them a choice to perform different tasks such as brainwashing, interrogation, etc. Although the game, before this facility is built, provides immediate and cost-free interrogation of captured agents, the MK Ultra option is more rewardable but also cost and time-dependent. =Espionage Network= This is the hub showing the world map. Here the player can send agents to scout suspicious activities, seek enemy agents or carry out missions. It also provides direct control of in-game time progression. =Investigation Board= Here cases, locations, and individuals can be researched to reveal new missions, resources, and technologies. Utilizing a classic pinboard and string approach, players scour the documents for matching codewords while connecting the dots on the corkboard. =Missions= Handled turn-based, missions have two modes: infiltration and combat mode. Infiltration mode allows the player to sneak into a location, stealthily complete an objective, and extract whilst undetected. Since most missions start in this mode, it also gives the player a chance to search and explore the map, learn enemy patterns and routines, locate enemy agents, and make strategic planning. Combat mode is usually triggered by the player, since most missions start as infiltration. Various things like unsuppressed fire, dead bodies found by civilians or enemies, etc. will trigger the alarm thus activating the combat mode. At this point, reinforcements start arriving, player agents catch heat, and the enemy openly engages combat. =Combat= Phantom Doctrine takes a new approach on turn-based tactics by almost complete removing die rolls for its combat solutions. Every character has awareness, a mechanic that represents the character's stoicism during a firefight. This resource is both used to perform special abilities and to dodge incoming attacks, and it regenerates every turn by a certain amount. When attacked, a target undergoes an awareness check that can result in a dodge, that will neglect incoming damage, or a graze, that will mitigate incoming damage (additional factors, such as armor, can mitigate the damage further). Upon this, a certain amount of awareness is spent. =Characters= All agents have four stats (circulatory, sensory, respiratory, motoric) that will determine their hit points, awareness, action points, etc. They also have perks, some of them may be hidden until certain missions and challenges are accomplished, and backgrounds that determine their starting weapon proficiencies and abilities. As agents gain experience they level up, thus gaining new perks that the player can choose freely from a given choice of four. Through training, they gain proficiency in various weapons which will increase their weapon efficiency and allow them to install weapon mods. Player agents may also accrue heat if their evacuation is compromised, through combat, or if they're seen on Infiltration missions. Heat decreases over time unless it reaches its max, at which point their ID is exposed meaning they will need to forge a new one. Agents with maxed heat will take longer to travel across the world map, and may be ambushed when idle outside the hideout. =Length of game-play = A single-player campaign takes about 40 hours to complete. Replayability Through randomly generated characters, algorithmically populated and adapted maps, and randomized intelligence snippets a unique experience is granted with every playthrough. Reception  GameSpot reviewer praises the feeling of paranoia in the game: \\"Tension and suspicion are ingrained throughout Phantom Doctrine to great effect. Its isometric turn- based combat system is rewardingly complex, steeped with the feeling of paranoia, where every variable decision and tactic needs to be carefully considered\\". The Guardian gave the game two out of five stars, criticizing the game for not teaching the player fundamental aspects of how to play.

He was almost invariably referred to as G. A. Richard, and from 1908 to his death customarily prefixed by \\"Captain\\". History Richard was born in Tasmania, a son of mine manager Moses John Richards (died at George Town, Tasmania on 3 June 1910) and his wife Eliza Richards, n√©e Sullivan (died at Beaconsfield on 20 August 1904). :Moses J. Richards, a temperance advocate, was a brother and prospecting partner of Samuel Richards, who discovered gold at Nine Mile Springs, acknowledged as the first payable reef in Tasmania, and shared his prize of ¬£1,000. (In 1881 Nine Mile Springs was renamed Lefroy, for Sir Henry Lefroy, acting Governor.) While in Tasmania Moses lived successively at Lefroy, Beaconsfield, and finally George Town. He was mine manager for the Native Youth Mining Company at Lefroy, then the City of Launceston mine while his brother managed the Native Youth. Richard was resident at Lefroy in 1882 when he owned a small parcel of shares in the Wanderer Gold Mining Company. Note spelling his surname still \\"Richards\\". He studied at the Ballarat School of Mines, and worked for a time in an assay office at Charters Towers, where he made some improvements to the systems employed there. He is said to have become an employee of the Mount Morgan Mine in 1884 This article has much information on the Mount Morgan gold find. in some minor capacity, and having gained the confidence of J. Wesley Hall (managing director and brother of Walter Russell Hall), was soon working in the assay office, and when Henry Trenear left, served in his place as head of that section. Wesley Hall retired in 1891, ushering in a new power elite, who attempted to interfere in technical matters, which Richard resisted strenuously. By 1894 he was making major changes in the ore treatment sheds, having greatly modified and simplified the gold extraction process, with demonstrable improvements in gold recovery and reduced costs. In 1901 he was left ¬£2,000 in Wesley Hall's will. Again spelled \\"Richards\\" Later that year he and G. P. Seale were sent by the company on a nine-month round-the-world tour of major gold producers. Richard was appointed mine manager in 1903. after the death of Roger Lisle, and general manager a few months later. By this time the Mine had collected a technical staff of expertise rivalled by no other company in Australia, with the possible exception of BHP, with salaries to match. At a rumoured ¬£3000 or more, Richard was reckoned to be the highest paid employee of any industrial company in Queensland. The news of his resignation was released on 1 July 1912. One historian asserts that it was made under pressure from managing director R. S. Archer, under instructions from directors R. G. Casey and (Sir) Kelso King, who believed he could not resist workers' demands in the event of a strike.I. W. Morley, 'Richard, George Anderson (1861‚Äì1943)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/richard-george- anderson-8192/text14329, published first in hardcopy 1988, accessed online 9 January 2019. There had been reports of stormy meetings, and in truth he may not have been sorry to go. There had been two recent mine disasters, and major problems with the new copper extraction process.

The exemptions were exchanged for arbitrary monetary fees. From an estimated 20,000 requests, 600 documented exemptions covering 1,000 people were granted, but only after 1942, when deportations to Auschwitz death camp had already stopped. Following the German invasion of 1944, when deportations resumed, all exemptions were nullified. Assessing the true humanitarian value of the exemptions is difficult. They could be revoked at any moment, and some were overlooked by the Slovak authorities after being paid for. A vast majority of them were granted to pre-1939 Christian converts only defined as racially Jewish, with only 6% granted to people actively practising the Jewish faith. 40% were in married relationships with \\"Aryans\\". Many were granted to highly trained professionals such as doctors who were valuable to the Slovak war effort. Meanwhile, there is clear documentation that between 68,000 and 71,000 of Slovak Jews, about 80% of the pre-war population, were murdered. Only 19,000 Jews were even left alive in Slovakia when the exemptions started. The exemptions are at the center of a historical and political debate in modern Slovakia. Some groups, in particular the fringes of Slovak nationalism, wish to put the exemptions forward as evidence that Tiso and his regime wished to protect Jews, and have claimed that up to 35,000 Jews were saved. Their claims have been challenged by Holocaust historians, who note the lack of documented evidence for more than 600 exemptions, or 1% of the Jewish population, pointing to a seeming reliance on exaggerated estimates. Background In March 1939, the Slovak State declared independence from Czechoslovakia; Germany invaded the Czech rump state. That October, Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest, became president of Slovakia. The new state immediately began to implement anti-Jewish measures aimed at removing Jews from the economy. In order to systematize antisemitic legislation, Slovak legislators passed the , 270 anti-Jewish articles largely focused at removing Jews from the economy, on 9 September 1941. Based on the Nuremberg Laws, the Code defined Jews in terms of their ancestry, banned intermarriage, and required that all Jews older than six wear a yellow armband. The Jewish Code excluded Jews from public life, forbidding them from traveling at certain times, using radios or phones, shopping at certain hours, or belonging to any clubs or organizations. Slovak propaganda asserted that the Jewish Code was the strictest set of anti-Jewish laws in Europe. However, the legislation also granted the president had the ability to exempt any Jew from the law. Exemptions After the passing of the Jewish Code, Tiso was \\"bombarded\\" by petitions from Jews asking to be exempted from the anti-Jewish legislation. These requests increased during the deportation of Slovakia's Jews in 1942, and eventually totaled 20,000. He was permitted to charge anywhere from 1,000 to 500,000 Slovak koruna (Ks) as an administrative fee and revoke exemptions at will. Each exemption protected the holder and his or her immediate family. Of the racially defined Jews granted exemptions, only 6% were of the Jewish faith and most had been baptized before 1939. At least 38% were in mixed marriages with \\"Aryans\\". Slovak historian Martina Fiamov√° wrote that Tiso only granted exemptions to ‚Äúmorally and politically reliable‚Äù Jews who contributed to Catholic causes. The exemption holders were also disproportionately well educated and many had professional careers useful to the Slovak State. For example, of 125 requests from Jewish doctors, 80 were granted. After the war, Tiso said that he had routinely charged 10,000-15,000 Ks for exemptions. According to American historian James Mace Ward, the process he used to grant the exemption \\"for the most part he only granted exemptions to Jews who were assimilated and Christian, in addition to economically useful. Even when it was granted, the presidential exemption did not guarantee protection, and local authorities sometimes deported exemption holders. Many Jews were deported before their request for exemption could be considered or issued. At the end of the deportations, 18,945 Jews were legally present in Slovakia, of whom 1,000 were protected by presidential exemptions. Three-quarters of these were in no danger of deportation, according to Ward's study. The majority of the exemptions were issued in 1943, after the deportations were over, and covered as many as 6,000 people, according to Ivan Kamenec's research. However, although these exemptions spared the holder from the requirements of the Jewish Code, such as having to wear a yellow badge, they did not save anyone's life. The exemptions were not honored after the German invasion of Slovakia in August 1944, after which about half of the remaining Jews were deported and murdered. Angry that some exemption holders had joined the partisans, Tiso cancelled many of them. Legacy According to Ward, the exemption allowed Tiso to present himself as a savior of Jews without making significant concessions in the antisemitic policies of the regime, therefore maintaining his Christian legitimacy without alienating his Nazi backers. The presidential exemption is the basis of claims by Milan Stanislav ƒéurica and Slovak ultranationalists that Tiso saved as many as 35,000 Jews from his regime's own antisemitic policies. These politically motivated statements aim to rehabilitate the reputation of Tiso and the Slovak State. However, this campaign had little relevance to the majority of Slovaks, and, according to a 2005 opinion poll, only 5% of Slovaks viewed Tiso \\"very favorably\\". Ward notes that the evidence for the number of exemptions issued is \\"straightforward and indisputable\\". A controversial textbook written by ƒéurica which presented Tiso and his colleagues as \\"saviours of the Jewish population\\" was harshly criticized by historians and later retracted.

The resulting cheese was extremely hard and was regarded as being of poor quality. It was also heavily salted in an attempt to make it last longer. Reports of low quality hard Suffolk cheese appear as far back as the 16th century by which time it was being exported to London. The trade with London was carried out by sea and continued into the 18th century with 985 tons being sold to London in 1740. High grain prices at the start of the 19th century resulted in Suffolk farmers moving away from dairy production and as a result Suffolk Bang largely stopped being made. The main consumers of Suffolk Bang were servants and labours who couldn't afford anything better. The cheese was also used for supplying the military who valued its long shelf life. The Royal Navy purchased around 1000 tons of the cheese a year up until 1758 at which point it stopped purchasing the cheese due to its crews finding it inedible. The cheese was also made on smaller scale for unmarried farm workers. One suggested method for eating the cheese was to melt it before spreading on bread along with salted pork.

Biography After completing her Masters at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, she had her first solo exhibition, Conversaciones con un loto azul, (1986) in Boston. Additionally, at the beginning of her career, Gruner began making short films and video performances that she recorded using a Super 8 camera. Her work is said to be heavily influenced by second wave feminism and post conceptual work, which caused critical debate in Mexico during the 1990s. Gruner's art is very unique and personal as she bases many of her pieces on her own personal experiences and culture. In addition, she explores these different ideas of nationality, identity, and feminism through many different mediums. She experiments a lot with film, photography, performance, and interactive art installations in order to appeal to a mass audience. Silvia Gruner is recognized as one of the most original artists of her time in Latin America and is praised for having created a new vocabulary in Mexican contemporary art.  Education  Gruner received her Fine Arts Degree from Bezalel Academy of Art & Design (1978-1982) and pursued her Masters in Fine Arts Degree at Massachusetts College of Art in Boston (1984-1986).  Works  =La mitad del Camino/The Middle of the Road, 1994 = Gruner wanted to create art directly on a part of the border fence that ran between the Colonia Libertad in Tijuana and San Diego. In this art instillation she installed more than 100 small figures of the Aztec goddess, Tlazolt√©otl. The goddess is seen as a symbol of fertility and motherhood, hence why Gruner crafted the goddess in a position of giving birth. It is left up to interpretation as to what Tlazolt√©otl, is supposed to signify here at the border as some believe it signifies rebirth and it meant to be comforting to illegal immigrants and a symbol of reassurance that those migrating will not forget their roots and culture.Anne-Laure Amilhat Szary. Walls and border art: the politics of art display. Journal of Borderlands Studies, Taylor Francis (Routledge), 2012, 27 (2), pp.213-228. <10.1080/08865655.2012.687216>. However, others believe that since Tlazolt√©otl is stuck on the border in the middle of childbirth, it can also raise a feeling of uncertainty during this significant transitional period where you are between the know and unknown. =Don't fuck with the past, you might get pregnant, 1994 = Gruner created an installation with a series of 16 photographic prints that depict small clay figures. Each Ektacolor (chromogenic development) print measures 20x24 inches and brings the overall installation to a size of 108x96 inches. She continues to explore the theme of time in this piece and its close entanglement with Mexican culture. She explains how in the Mexican culture people are taught to look at the past in a conservative way and uses this work to address the parallel between culture and different Mexican taboos. She not only challenges this taboo but counters gender binaries by using this piece to deal with the masculine and the feminine simultaneously. In addition, Gruner purposely enters these images with a disruptive attitude in order to powerfully inhabit this unknown territory. Through the use of everyday objects she demonstrates how this piece is deeply rooted in the Mexican culture and shows not only their history but the people themselves within the art. =How to look at Mexican Art, 1995= In How to look at Mexican Art , Gruner pictures her fingers through a punctured molcajete on top of a piece of bright red plastic. A molcajete is a stone tool used to grind different items and are typically associated with indigenous Mexican culture. Molcajetes remain popular today as they are used throughout Latin America to grind different foods. In the photographic diptych, the first picture shows her grasping the molcajete from the top and then moves to put her fingers through the hole from the bottom. Through the use of incorporating her own body in her art it shows how personal this piece is and how she is challenging her culture and Mexican heritage. Additionally, the molcajete contrasts against the bright red plastic can be seen as a contrast between the past and the modern present. The molcajete is also very significant and personal in this piece as it belonged to Gruner's childhood nana, or nursemaid which shows how it has been used by various women and is full of tradition. The ambiguity in this piece is meant to leave viewers with the expectations of typical 'Mexican Art'. =Centinela (Sentinel), 2007= Centinela is a video in which the artist has her head shaved from recent cancer treatments and stands in front of a modernist fountain created by Mathias Goeritz, Ricardo Legorreta, and Isamu Noguchi. Gruner explains how in this piece nothing really happens but simultaneously everything happens. In the video, the subject remains still, completely immobile yet everything in her surroundings continue. The water continues to thrust back and forth, the cars continue to pass by, the environment is dynamic. Once again, through the inclusion of herself in her own work it shows how Gruner explores her own personal life and in this case deals with the emotions of her battle with cancer. Additionally, the title 'Sentinel' refers to a soldier who stands to keep watch as she is doing in the video. =Hemisferios/Hemispheres, 2016= Silvia Gruner's work Hemispheres was aimed to introduce Gruner's work to New York's audience, and explores the dichotomy between the personal and collective. It is an installation of a series of her work and a video interview but the main piece takes place in the garden. This exhibition contains an arrangement of bright red thread, spread throughout two gardens. The piece is meant to exhibit Gruner's brain and the different thoughts and ideas being dispersed throughout the space. Her goal was to express the complexity of thoughts and feelings, in a world so complicated. It is representative of how everything in her life is connected yet it constructed by different fragments. The exhibition highlights her works such as The films Sand (1986) and Sentinel (2007), How to Look at Mexican Art (1995), Bauhaus for Monkeys (2011), and 500 kilos of Impotence (or possibility) (1998). Overall, the exhibition is meant to highlight over 30 years of her work and the dichotomies between a \\"psychological and subjective dimension, and a political and cultural one.\\"  Solo exhibitions  *1986 Conversaciones con un loto azul, (Thompson Gallery, Massachusetts College of Arts, Boston Massachusetts) *1987 El Callejon del Beso, (Boston, Massachusetts) *1990 Instalaciones, dibujos, video, (Museo Universitario del Chopo, Mexico City) *1991 De las formas ancestrales o uno comiendose su propia cola, (Curare, Mexico City) * 1992 Destierro, (Centro Cultural Arte Contemporaneo, Mexico City) * 1992 Destierro, Itzamatitlan, (Morelos, Mexico) * 1992 Fetiches domesticos, Itzamatitlan, (Morelos, Mexico) * 1993 La expulsion del paraiso, Ex-Convento de Tepoztlan, (Morelos, Mexico) * 1993 Los justificaciones del placer, Galeria Nina Menocal, (Mexico City) * 1994 Azote ‚Äì a, Installation, Temistocles 44, (Mexico City) * 1994 Reliquias, Instituto de Cooperacion Iberoamericana de Buenos Aires, (Argentina) * 1994 Inventario, Video installation, Museo Carrillo Gil, (Mexico City) * 1996 Cubiertos, XXIV Festival Cervantino, Alhondiga de Granaditas, (Guanajuato, Mexico) * 1997 Collares, Centro de la Imagen, (Mexico City, Mexico) * 1997 Detalles Arquitectonicos, Galeria Arte Contemporaneo, (Mexico City, Mexico) * 1998 500 kilos de impotencia (o posibilidad).

It is located at the boundary of the old city at the crossing of RempartstraŒ≤e and GartenstraŒ≤e. The edifice was listed as a cultural monument of special significance in accordance with paragraph 12 of the Monument Protection Law.  History  The gate is the only preserved edifice of the fortifications of Freiburg designed by Vauban in 1677 in the Baroque style. When the French troops slighted the fortifications during their withdrawal in 1745, it remained the only gate among the four original. It was called Porte Saint- Martin at the time - like the one in Paris, both built for Louis XIV - and was an emblematic gateway to the city. Later, the gate received the name Breisacher Tor because the traffic of the southern arterial road heading toward Breisach and Basel passed through it. Marie Antoinette, the younger daughter of Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I of the Austrian Empire came in the city through the Breisacher Tor on her wedding journey to the French royal court. In the second half of 19th century a third floor was added to the original two-storey construction, when a triangular gable was added to the jutting out median risalit. The building was then used as a school. During the reshaping of Gartenstra√üe in the year 1903 the east wing was demolished, but you can still see the foundations demarcated with pavement.  Application  The Breisacher Tor was seriously damaged during World War II and was restored in 1950/51 in the style of the late-19th-century. Initially it was used by an insurance company; subsequently until 2007 it housed administrative offices of the city of Freiburg. In 1989 the square behind the building was enhanced with trees and a B√§chle. After the following sale to a private individual the whole building was renovated. While the University of Freiburg rents the upper floors where seminars and lectures are held, there is a restaurant on the ground floor of the central block of the gate that uses the square behind the building ‚Äì the former access ‚Äì as a terrace.

Online Gallery, British Library. Retrieved 9 January 2019. Alexander Aikman (23 June 1755 ‚Äì 6 July 1838) was a Scottish printer, newspaper publisher, planter, and member of Jamaica's House of Assembly. From 1805 to 1825, he was a member of the House of Assembly as the representative of Saint George parish. Early life He was born on 23 June 1755 at Barrowstounness (Bo'ness), County of Linlithgow (now part of Falkirk Council), Scotland. His parents Andrew Aikman (1723-1785) and Ann Hunter (1730-1759). Ann was the only child of William Hunter and Margaret Aynsley. His older brother was William Aikman (1751-1784). William immigrated to the British Colony of Jamaica in 1775. There, he became involved in the printing business with David Douglass. William died childless at the age of 33. His older sister was Marion Aikman (1753- ). Marion married Alexander Henderson in 1782 and raised their family in Scotland. After his mother passed, his father married Janet Nimmo in 1766. Together they had three sons: (John, Andrew, and James) and two daughters (Janet and Mary), all of whom remained in Scotland. In 1771, at the age of sixteen, Alexander left Scotland for British South Carolina, He settled in Charleston and apprenticed himself to Robert Wells (1728-1794), a Loyalist and fellow Scotsman. In British America, Robert Wells was a major book-trading, printer, and newspaper publisher. By 1764, Wells ran his own newspaper, the South Carolina and American General Gazette. By 1775, Wells claimed to have the largest stock of books for sale in America. While in Charleston, Wells wrote and published his version of \\"Travestie of Virgil.\\" Wells was a ‚Äúfervent Loyalist.\\" Consequently, at the opening of the American Revolutionary War, Wells left the colonies and relocated to London. Robert Wells married Mary Rowand. Together, they had six children, including Louisa Susannah Wells, William Charles Wells, and Helena Wells. While apprenticing for Wells, Alexander Aikman clerked alongside Wells‚Äô daughter, Louisa Susannah Wells, for about four years.  Career  Kingston, & Port Royal. From Windsor Farm by James Hakewill At the American Revolutionary War, Alexander, in common with several other Loyalists, left British America and immigrated to the British Colony of Jamaica. He arrived in Saint George Parish, about 1777, at the age of 22. Soon after his arrival, he purchased the printing business of Robert Sherlock of Spanish- Town. In 1779 he founded The Jamaica Mercury and Kingston Weekly Advertiser with David Douglass (d. 1786). In 1780 it became The Royal Gazette. It was published weekly in Port Royal Street, but soon afterward in Harbour Street. Alexander's older brother William operated a book and stationery store on King Street. In 1780 Douglass and Aikman became printers to the House of Assembly and the King's Printer. In addition, they printed \\"Almanac and Register,\\" \\"Observations on the Dysentery of the West Indies,\\" \\"A Brief History of the Late Expedition against Fort San Juan,\\" and other books. After Douglass died in 1786, Alexander Aikman became the printer. In 1803 Alexander Aikman & Son were the printers. In 1809 it was Alexander Aikman, Jr. After his son's death in 1831, Alexander, for a short time, resumed his printing and publishing businesses before retiring. From 1805 to 1825, Alexander represented the old parish of Saint George as a member of British Jamaica's House of Assembly. During that period, he owned three properties, two of which were in Saint George Parish. Aikman visited England in 1796 to hire a pressman (in which voyage he was taken by a privateer, and had to repurchase his property at Philadelphia). He visited again in 1801, in 1803, and in 1814, but from that time had remained at home. En route to his 1796 London visit, it appears Alexander experienced another incident. His daughter's gravestone describes surviving a shipwreck off Isle of Wight's coast. Others confirm the passage of a significant storm in the English Channel, which caused significant damage, injuries, and death. From Susannah Aikman's altar tomb (see: Louisa Susanna Wells' page for detail): > In the memorable Storm of Novr. 17th and 18th 1795, she escaped shipwreck, > together with her Father, Mother, and infant Sister when above 2000 of their > fellow creatures met a watery grave near the back of this Island. Alexander was a wealthy man. He owned four properties, each of which initially relied on slaves. Those properties were \\"Birnam Wood\\" in Saint George (257 enslaved), \\"Wallenford\\" in Saint George (58 enslaved), \\"Prospect Pen\\" in Saint Andrew (39 enslaved), and his printing office in Kingston (3 enslaved). In 1831, approximately 60,000 of Jamaica's 300,000 slaves initiated a strike, which escalated and became the Baptist War. In 1834, slavery was abolished throughout Jamaica, British West Indies, and the British Empire. In Jamaica, former slaves transitioned to an apprenticeship program, with full freedom in 1838. Prospect Pen was also known as Prospect Park, which subsequently became Vale Royal. Later, Vale Royal became the official residence of the Colonial Secretary. Family He married at Kingston, Jamaica, on 14 January 1782, Louisa Susannah Wells (1755-1831), second daughter of his former master Robert Wells. She joined him from England after no little peril, having twice attempted the voyage: on the first attempt, she was captured by the French, by whom she was detained for three months in France, and on the second by a King's ship, in consequence of taking her passage in a slave vessel. By this lady who died on 29 November 1831 (and of whom a brief memoir will be found in the Gentleman's Magazine vol. CI pt. ii, p. 571), Aikman had two sons and eight daughters. Of their ten children, six died as infants. All six infants are buried near his brother, Andrew, at The Strangers' Burial Ground in Kingston. His three surviving daughters were Mary Ann (1782-1844), the wife of James Smith of Saint Andrews, Jamaica, Ann Hunter (1788-1841), the widow of John Enright, Surgeon R.N (1795-1817), and Susanna (1791-1818). His only surviving son and successor in business was Alexander Aikman, Jr. (1783-1831). In 1805, Alexander Aikman, Jr. married Charlotte Cory (1781-1810). Together, they had two children: Alexander Wells Aikman (1808-1869) and Amelia Ann Aikman (1809-1818). After Charlotte's passing, Alexander's two children were raised by his mother, Louisa Susannah Aikman. Four years later, in 1814, Alexander Aikman, Jr. married Mary Bryan (1787-1850) and had seven more children: four daughters and three sons. Alexander Aikman Jr. died on April 1831 at the age of 47, leaving several young children.Alexander Aikman senior. Legacies of British Slave-ownership, University College London. Retrieved 9 January 2018. After his son's death, Alexander Aikman, Sr. returned to the family printing business. Alexander's wife, Louisa, removed to Cowes, Isle of Wight, presumably to be with her daughter, Susannah. It was in Cowes where she raised her grandchildren Alexander Wells and Amelia Ann. In 1831, Louisa died in Isle of Wight, thirteen years after her daughter. Death Aikman died on 6 July 1838 at Prospect Park, Saint Andrew, Jamaica, aged 83. He is buried at St. Andrew's Parish Church, commonly called \\"Half-Way-Tree Church.\\" His son and daughter-in-law Charlotte Cory Aikman is buried in the same cemetery.

Taxonomy and naming Trichoglottis australiensis was first formally described in 1967 by Alick Dockrill and the description was published in The Orchadian from a specimen collected in the McIlwraith Range by Malcolm Brown. The specific epithet (australiensis) refers to Australia, the ending -ensis being a Latin suffix \\"denoting place\\", \\"locality\\" or \\"country\\". Distribution and habitat The weeping cherub orchid grows on trees and rocks in dense vegetation along gullies and in other humid places. It only occurs in the Iron and McIlwraith Ranges at altitudes between . Conservation This orchid is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.

She was born in Handsworth, now part of Birmingham, and died at Colehill in Dorset. Life Tristan amd Inseult (1902) The Courtship of Ferb (1902) Caroline Watts was the youngest child of Robert Watts. He manufactured buttons in Handsworth up to the year 1891, when he retired and moved to St Margarets in the Twickenham area with his youngest children. Caroline Watts studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. Upon their father's death in 1894, Watts and her sister Mary moved to Pimlico. In the 1901 census, the sisters stated Mary's occupation was compiler of indexes, while Caroline worked as a painter. The first illustrations that can be traced back to her were drawn from 1899 on. Some depict the King Arthur legend, while others were drawn for various historical novels written by Jessie Weston and published by Alfred Nutt. Upon Nutt's death, his wife M. L. Nutt, an involved women's rights activist, took over the publishing house. Under her watch, various suffragette works were published. It is therefore assumed that she put Watts in touch with the women's right activists. In 1908, Watts created the Artists' Suffrage League's promotional poster Bugler Girl for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies' June demonstrations. The motif was thereafter made the logo of the suffragette newspaper and was copied frequently. It was also borrowed by the Women's suffrage in the United States movement and recoloured in purple, white and green. Watts and her sister lived in Godalming in 1911 and had moved to Colehill, Dorset by 1918. Selection of book illustrations * Gottfried von Stra√üburg: The Story of Tristan and Iseult.

It is also known as 'layer-by-layer growth'. It is considered an ideal growth model, requiring perfect lattice matching between the substrate and the layer growing on to it, and it is usually limited to homoepitaxy. For FM growth to occur, the atoms that are to be deposited should be more attracted to the substrate than to each other, which is in contrast to the layer-plus-island growth model. FM growth is the preferred growth model for producing smooth films. It was first described by South African physicist Jan van der Merwe and British physicist Frederick Charles Frank in a series of four papers based on van der Merwe's PhD research between 1947 and 1949.
